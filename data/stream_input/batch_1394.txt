B004XCUEXY|5.0|You do not need to be a Foo Fighter fan to appreciate what a terrific documentary this is. It gives the complete history of the Foos from Nirvana through the recording of their amazing album Wasting Light. The way each of the band members (and ex-member) was interviewed gave the movie a real personal feel to it. Dave Grohl speaking about current and past band members and lamenting on how he regretted some of the decisions he made (replacing all of William's drum tracks on The Colour and the Shape, for example) while other decisions, though very painful (firing Franz), were what was needed to move the band forward, was extremely captivating. Make sure you watch all the way through the credits as well to get Dave's true feeling on the bands name. It's hystercial.<br /><br />I only wish they had included more of the Roxy concert (Bridge Burning at the end) even as an extra would have been great.<br /><br />This is a MUST own for any Foo Fighter fan
0439023491|5.0|I am falling more and more in love Katniss's character and this series the more i read. I only wanted to stop reading one time, which was when the Quarter Quell card was read (for obvious reasons when you read this novel). I was just so crush that that event was going to take place and thought there was going to be no hope for my two favorite characters, but i stuck through it and just kept going and i couldn't have made a better decision. This series is unbelievably amazing and i will never get sick of it. If you have only read the first novel or haven't started the series yet at all i URGE you to get your copies of this series, because it will blow your mind away. I highly recommend this to all my readers no matter what kind of Young Adult sub-genre you usually go for.

1612130283|2.0|Granted I'm no author, so this review won't win any Pulitzers. In fact, I had to double-check that I spelled \\"Pulitzer\\" correctly.<br /><br />I admit it freely, I read Twilight. I enjoyed it for what it was; a light, easy read which took me back a decade...okay TWO...to my teenage years. Stephenie Meyer got a lot of flack about her abilities as a writer, but she never claimed to be a Poet Laureate and while the literary elite of the world snicker at her \\"little books\\" she's laughing all the way to the bank.<br /><br />I can't help but feel this author is trying too hard for Meyers-like fame. I caught glimpses of reviews that warned me this was much along the same lines as the Twilight series only the \\"love\\" shared by the main characters is not so chaste. I was prepared for some easy-reading and a little bit of a plot. But what I found just leaves me, well, annoyed. Disclaimer: I'm only about 80% finished with the first book, I'm not even sure if the others are out yet?<br /><br />I was NOT prepared for the striking similarities that I found between the two book series. If you're like me and cannot help but dwell on things once you notice them, I warn you - READ NO FURTHER if you're planning on reading these, it'll ruin them for you as it did me.<br /><br />I know it seems SUPER PICKY, but these are just the main things that stood out glaringly. I'm not even mentioning the little subtleties in the writing or plot (ahem, going down south to see her mother and boyfriend has to come along). Anyway, here's my list:<br /><br />TWILIGHT<br />Edward<br />Height: Tall<br />Body: Well Built<br />Hair: Copper, messy<br />Wallet: Rich<br />Family: Adopted<br />Personality: Brooding, Secretive<br /><br />Other Attributes:<br />*Repeatedly tells Bella to stay away 'cos he's bad news<br />*Buys Bella a car which pisses her off<br />*Wants to drink Bella's blood<br /><br />...SHADES OF GREY<br />Christian<br />Height: Check<br />Body: Check<br />Wallet: Check<br />Family: Check<br/>Personality: Check<br /><br />*Ditto with Ana<br />*Ditto with Ana<br />*Wants to spill Ana's blood, or at least mark her up a bit<br /><br />And now our heroines<br /><br />Bella<br />Body: Slender<br />Hair: Long brown hair<br />Wallet: Middle-class, all-American girl<br />Family: Hair-brained Mom, trust-worty dad<br />BFF: A dark-skinned guy pines for her, she just wants to be friends<br />Vehicle: A rusty old beater that she loves<br /><br />Other Attributes:<br />*Thinks she's average looking, but is pretty<br />*Clumsy<br />*Insecure about herself<br />*Virgin<br /><br />Anastasia<br />Body: Check<br />Hair: Check<br />Wallet: Check<br />Family: Check<br />BFF: Check<br />Vehicle: Check<br /><br />Other Attributes:<br />*Check<br />*Check<br />*Check<br />*Check<br /><br />I rest my case. Yet I'm still reading it. If I sit too long wondering what that says about me I may need a therapist.
0374531269|5.0|Very intense and sad and excruciating. There are passages in this autobiography that resound with the author's honesty and pain.<br /><br />Mr. Beah writes in a straight-forward manner and this conveys his physical and emotional journey across his troubled land.<br /><br />This boy lost a great deal - his family, his home, his friends, and his country; but in the end he regained his dignity.  His story gives us the starkness and violence of being a child soldier - but we are also left with the quest of a young boy/man who struggled to emancipate himself from his past demons.<br /><br />This is a visceral book to read and it is also a very soulful read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There's so many reviews that either love it or hate it.  I for one loved it.<br /><br />It's the story of a young girl who is about to graduate college and a multimillionaire, Christian Grey.  Both characters are complex.  Miss Anastasia Steele is very much like most young women of today, sure of somethings, not sure about others.  She stumbles into Mr. Grey's office and feels like a total klutz.  Mr. Grey is what most women would fantasize about a young, handsome, rich, seemingly self assured, powerful, virile, sexy man.<br /><br />I was surprised at how quickly after the introduction of the 2 characters the book takes a turn into an erotica, if BSMD/Erotica offends you do not read this book.  Like most reviewers said, this is not all about sex.  It is about a man's discovery of a loving relationship.  That's what I got from it.  I can relate to Anastasia.  She's very attracted to a guy who seems light years out of her league.  Then he throws in a huge curve ball with submissive/dominant sex.  Then his personality traits and his pasted.  She has to decide what she wants/needs/feels and can handle.<br /><br />There's a good amount of romance to story.  Like when Mr. Grey drops everything to be with Ana when she makes a joke in an email, that he misconstrues as a rejection.<br /><br />-robin

B00729GQ0A|5.0|This story sure took me on for a ride.<br /><br />I read the summary thinking it was going to be a typical paranormal romance... Vampire like creatures. Shape-shifters and witches. Oh, and let's not forget the forbidden romance. Boy, was I wrong. There's so much more to it than that. And the more is just too much to speak of.<br /><br />The details and the history involved placed me in a world that I couldn't help get lost in. I felt like I was watching a movie rather than reading since the words flowed easily off the page. Love it when that happens.<br /><br />Sophia seemed so real, her character was written with all these little complexities and yet, she was also simple, someone that I think anyone could relate to, which makes her all the more special.<br /><br />I won't comment on Charles in fear of giving anything away. Can't have that. Must read it to find out. ;)<br /><br />What I will say is that I was pleasantly surprised at how the story turned out. Loved the twists and turns. The story had just the right amount of angst, sexy-times, action, humor and drama to balance it all out. It started nice and slow and as the story progressed it quickly turned into a page-turner that was difficult to put down.<br /><br />I should mention that I won this book from the author, and what a win it was! Thank you! I look forward to the next installment!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|So far I've been stuck playing this game for well over 30 mins. Still on the first episode though, I managed to create 28 of the 248 elements and I have 8 of 26 groups. Have not experienced any lag or force closures. Graphics are pleasing and gameplay is smooth, very addictive for me lol. Either way the objective of this episode is to create elements and groups out of earth air water and fire, I did create an alcoholic, zombie, ghoul and a corpse also a bottle of vodka:) There is a kids safe mode available as well. I've never played Alchemy before so I can't really compare but I am enjoying this game.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|It seems like whenever anyone in the film or TV industry decides to remake a popular series they always get it wrong. They either try to spoof the original poorly or create a show that is similar in name only. But when they do get it right it's a sight to behold. Such is the case with HAWAII FIVE-O.<br /><br />The original classic series in the 60s and into the 70s was known first off by its guitar twanging theme song performed by The Ventures. With scenes of the islands, surfers and hula girls, we were introduced to a special task force the fought crime in Hawaii. Led by Steve McGarret (played by Jack Lord), the show was an instant hit that lasted past the 10 year mark.<br /><br />The new series uses the same names and locations but twist them just enough to bring them into the 21st century. Hawaii has changed quite a bit since the sixties and it shows just in the opening credits which continue to use the same toe tapping theme song. So how do we change characters?<br /><br />To begin with McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin) is now a Special Forces commander whose transporting the brother of an arms dealer named Hesse (James Marsters). As Hesse's men attempt to snatch the brother back, the transport goes wrong, the prisoner dies and Hesse kills Steve's father. Returning for the funeral and to catch the arms dealer still in the islands, he's offered the job of creating a special law enforcement branch in Hawaii with no holds barred, put together by the governor (Jean Smart). He turns her down and sets out on his own to seek revenge.<br /><br />The officer in charge of the investigation is Danny \\"Danno\\" Williams (Scott Caan). A Jersey cop transplanted to the islands to be near his daughter (moved there by his ex) he's not at all an islander. The two meet as Steve checks out the crime scene of his father's murder and Danny catches him there. After finding a few more pieces of the puzzle, Steve agrees to the governor's request and now the pair forms an unlikely team.<br /><br />As they track down leads a few other characters join them. Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim) is someone Steve knew from the past, a man his father trusted. He's on the outs with the Hawaiian police department because they suspected him of stealing money. A simple denial is all Steve needs to trust him. When the time comes for an undercover female agent, Chin brings in his cousin Kono Kalaua (Grace Park). A week from graduating the police academy, but saddled with her cousin's legacy, she jumps at the chance to be part of the team.<br /><br />With pieces of the puzzle coming together and the team assembled, they go out in search of Hesse to bring him to justice. Keep in mind, we're just talking about the pilot here. The rest of the series is just as exciting and fast paced.<br /><br />The rapport between the characters is crucial to what makes this series work as well as it does. They joke with one another, they get angry at each other, but in the end they work together and work well. Each actor brings something special to their roles as part of the team. O'Loughlin is big on action, Caan the family man who cares about his friends, Kim has ties to most of the community and Park is the fresh face who's taking it all in. If the actors could not meet the requirements of the stories being told, it would all fall apart. But each does an amazing job.<br /><br />In other episodes the team takes on Serbian mobsters, gangs connecting to the mainland, foreign ambassadors and someone fans of the original show will be glad to hear about. McGarrett has an arch foe in this series carried from the original in Wo Fat (Mark Dacascos), an criminal genius who appears in various episodes, or at least his name, from the get go. By the first season's conclusion, he turns the world of this team around in a cliff hanger that leaves you guessing.<br /><br />If you haven't jumped on the bandwagon for this show, now is the time. The new season just started and there's little doubt that it willhave as many thrills, as much action and great stories as season one has. Pick up the first season and climb aboard now. This is one series that not only is worth watching but is worth adding to the collection on your shelf.have as many thrills, as much action and great stories as season one has.

B005B0QYMM|5.0|Every so often a movie comes along that delights to no end. It's one of those movies that not everyone has heard of or that actually lives up to the hype that preceded it. When it happens, which is rare, it is one of the best times you have with a movie. Such is the case with GRAVE ENCOUNTERS.<br /><br />The movie falls into the category of lost footage films that became popular with both THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films. Both were films put together with supposedly lost footage of some group or person that just now were being released. That happens here as a producer of reality television shows opens by telling us about the proposed series called \\"Grave Encounters\\". It was supposedly ahead of it's time, a reality show about ghost hunters before they were common.<br /><br />Led by Lance Preston (Sean Rogerson), the group investigates haunted locations in an attempt to offer proof of the paranormal. In reality as we watch this raw footage unroll we learn that it's all a gag to him and his crew, a group that doesn't actually believe in ghosts let alone having seen one. To them this is nothing more than a way to get on TV and be known, a way to make money.<br /><br />Along with Lance we have Matt White (Juan Riedinger) their tech specialist, Sasha Parker (Ashleigh Gryzko) a paranormal expert, camera man T.C. Gibson (Merwin Mondesir) and renowned psychic Houston Gray (Mackenzie Gray) who is actually an actor pretending to be a psychic. This group comes together to prove or debunk the supernatural in the series. With five episodes in the can they head out to their latest location, an abandoned asylum where nefarious tests were run on the inmates and where a few of them escaped to take down the doctor who committed these deeds and kill him.<br /><br />At first we see them try and coerce a handyman into claiming he saw a ghost for $20 and get to hear from a local historian who gives them the background on the location. Afterwards the current care taker unlocks the building and lets them in, padlocking the door from the outside once they're in (lockdowns are a part of several ghost hunting shows on air now). Matt sets up cameras in steady positions throughout the building and the crew has equipment of their own and the show begins filming.<br /><br />Nothing happens at first. The stage is being set for the viewer, that feeling of disbelief and the hope that something will happen only intensified by the setting and the use of night vision cameras shooting in the dark. If you hate hand held camera films you might not like this one but its not as intrusive as some have been in the past. There's a feeling of dread in the air as they walk the abandoned halls finding wheel chairs overturned gurneys. But little happens at first.<br /><br />When it does it's something simple. A tug, a push and finally we see Sasha's hair lifted by something not there. While this may seem spooky to us it's even worse for those involved as this is the first actual paranormal encounter that any of them have experienced. They are in over their head and soon find that these ghosts want to do more than just play with them.<br /><br />As things progress from bad to worse, they decided to stick together in the lobby and shut down the shooting. They have enough to put together and episode and have had enough. Sending Matt to pick up all the stationery cameras, he disappears and the group soon find themselves searching for him. And while doing so, they encounter more than they can handle.<br /><br />There's the set up of the movie. It was seen in the previews that were available before it was released. And for some reason it never got a wide or well played release to theaters which is sad. That's because this movie offers more scares and jumps, more creepy and chilling sequences than any movie I've seen in quite some time. While the similarly themed PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was gave me goose bumps, this one gave me more scares and had me more frightened at times. And even in scenes where you knew something was going to happen, the tension was so well developed that you felt relief after jumping.<br /><br />The actors are all quite believable. While none of them are well known recognizable faces it works to their advantage. It would be hard to believe someone like Tom Cruise as Lance knowing that he's, well, Tom Cruise. With unrecognizable faces you believe that maybe this really is lost footage. Okay not really but it helps make it more believable.<br /><br />Being a fan of horror films its rare for me to watch one and not feel cheated these days. So many go for the cheap scare, the gore extreme or the simple torture porn film, never relying on atmosphere. This movie drips with atmosphere. Although made on a small budget you'd never know while watching it. Instead you hope that no current group of ghost hunters have to experience what this team does. The movie is one of the best horror films I've seen in years. And having watched so many of them that's saying something.ened at times.

1594744769|3.0|I wouldn't call this a horror story. More of a paranormal mystery. I liked the pictures that make up the story. I thought it was very original of the author to make a story out of all these old photographs. He did a very good job of linking them all together without making them seem out of place or forced together. You would never know that the photos weren't originally part of the story.<br /><br />Overall I feel this book was a fun read, but nothing extraordinary. The characters were developed well, but I was underwhelmed with Jacob as the main character. Emma definitely stole the spotlight once she came into the picture and I almost wish the story was told from her perspective, although then the story would be very different then what it currently is. I'm interested to see what the author does with the next book as the peculiars set out on their journey.
B005OK721G|3.0|There was a time when revenge films played in drive ins across the country. Low budget efforts that made stars of actors like Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent were hits and led them to bigger and better things. These films were so successful that major studios began making them as well. COLUMBIANA shows that they continue to do so.<br /><br />In 1992, nine year old Catalyea witnesses the murder of her mother and father in Bogot&aacute;, Columbia. Her father did the killing for a cartel leader and although they swear allegiance, neither actually trust one another. Questioned by the leader of the killers, Cataleya she sticks a knife through his hand and then runs off using a plan her father gave her. Once in the states she finds her way to her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) and tells him she wants to be trained as a killer.<br /><br />Fast forward 12 years and we now see Cataleya all grown up in the form of actress Zoe Saldana. Pretending to be a drunk driver she gets herself arrested and locked up for the night. In reality she's stone cold sober and using the arrest as a ruse to get close to a special prisoner. Using methods taught to her over the years, she escapes her cell, kills the prisoner and returns to her cell before anyone is suspicious. The next morning she leaves before the jail is locked down.<br /><br />Cataleya has fulfilled her destiny and desire to become a leading contract killer. Her one flaw is that she leaves a drawing of a cataleya, an orchid, on each of her victims. She's done so in hopes that it will draw out Don Luis, the man who had her father killed. The killings so far have paid her well and provided her with experience. Now she wants to use it for the promise she made at age nine.<br /><br />Small subplots are found as well. Cataleya has a lover, an artist named Danny (Michael Vartan) she shares a bed with but no information. To be close to someone would present the possibility of dividing her attention or possibly losing them. We also have a determined FBI agent named Ross (Lennie James) who is closing in on this mystery killer they call the Tag killer due to her artwork on the victims.<br /><br />Cataleya takes on one more job before the police finally discuss her tags with the press and force Don Luis out of hiding. Taken in as an informant by the CIA, he's in New Orleans under their care, still running his drug business on the side. When he discovers who this killer is he sends his men to wipe her and any family members out. But to do so will do nothing more than make her motivation stronger than ever.<br /><br />COLOMBIANA was hyped as being from the same people who made TAKEN. While there are connections the film isn't nearly as good. Yes, it provides plenty of action, violence and explosions but the story isn't quite as interesting.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana in the lead shows that she can act and do so well enough to take the lead in a major motion picture. Each role she's taken in the past has led her this direction and now one could say she's achieved the status of star enough that she can carry a film on her own.<br /><br />All that said I find this movie more in the so-so category, a movie that provides the basics of what is expected in an action film these days but never quite makes it one that you'll want to watch over and over again. It includes all of the traits of the genre but never quite pulls you in in the same way TAKEN did. If you're going to tout the connection between one movie and another you'd better make sure it's as good if not better.<br /><br />But it does offer a nice evening's entertainment when the comparison is tossed aside. Perhaps those in charge of advertising would do better next time not to compare one movie to another. In doing so a decent movie would seem better on its own. COLUMBIANA is a decent action flick, but when compared to others it loses a few points.a determined FBI agent named Ross (Lennie James) who is closing in on this mystery killer they call the Tag killer due to her artwork on the victims.<br /><br />Cataleya takes on one more job before the police finally discuss her tags with the press and force Don Luis out of hiding.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was great, as were all three in the trilogy!  It is one of, if not the best, series in this genre that i have read, and i've read a lot of BDSM books!  The story line drew me in from the very first page. There's romance and even some suspense in the second and third in the series.  The sex scenes were hot!  i really don't understand why some didn't like it, but to each his/her own.  i highly recommend all three books in this  series.

B004LWZW7O|3.0|The subject of time and immortality has had a long standing tradition in science fiction. Perhaps the most famous of late was the 1976 film LOGAN'S RUN where people died voluntarily on their thirtieth birthday. So it only seems natural that the subject of time would once again come to the forefront in sci-fi as it does with IN TIME.<br /><br />In the future humans have been genetically altered to stop aging at on their 25th birthday. The problem is when they hit that age they only have so many hours left to live. Embedded in each person is a digital readout on their arm that shows how long they have. To gain more hours you must work to earn them. This means those on the low end of the scale must work to pay for their daily needs like food and shelter. It also means that when their clock reads 0 they die.<br /><br />Existing in this world is Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), a factory worker trying to make ends meet while living with his mother (Olivia Wilde). She has just turned 50 and it may take viewers a second to realize that when he kisses this woman it's his mom not a girlfriend. Remember, you stop aging at 25.<br /><br />Due to celebrate her birthday after work, Will stops by a bar with his friend to find a stranger passing out free drinks with nearly a century of time on his arm. When the local hood and his gang attempt to rob him of his time, Will helps him escape. The man is Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) and he and Will talk about time. He explains that for there to be time for the upper crust to live they have to take it from someone else. Tax hikes and higher prices are just ways for the rich and famous to live longer at the costs of those below them. While hiding out overnight, Henry passes along his hours to Will telling him to use them wisely.<br /><br />Will tries to reach his mother but things don't work out as planned. She's just paid off her latest loan with less than an hour left and it costs 2 hours to ride the bus. On the street near home she and Will head towards each other but just as they are about to meet, she collapses, her time out. Now Will decides to take the time problem to its source, the wealthy.<br /><br />Staying at fine hotels and buying a fast car, the world of the rich is different. No one hurries as they have all the time in the world. But Will can't help himself. It's this fast paced lifestyle that singles him out as the Timekeepers, police who handle time crimes, come looking for him led by Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy). Will ends up at a casino where he wagers all his time against a wealthy businessman named Philipe Weiss (Vincent Kartheiser), a wager that Will wins resulting in an invitation to Weiss home.<br /><br />At the party Will meets Philipe's daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) and the two are attracted to one another. But Sylvia also finds herself attracted to the differences she finds in Will having no idea where he is actually from. When the Timekeepers show to arrest Will, he takes Sylvia hostage and heads home.<br /><br />What follows is a transformation of Sylvia as she sees how others live doing anything for just a few more hours. With the Timekeepers hot on their trail, they begin robbing banks to redistribute time to those in need, sort of a Robin Hood of the time clock.<br /><br />Eventually we know that a final confrontation will result as Raymond diligently pursues the couple as does the local hood Will confronted at the start of the film. With plenty of high speed chases and some face to face confrontation, the film features plenty of action for fans without a ton of story to get in the way. Sure the story is there but as the film heads to its end it becomes smaller and smaller.<br /><br />The time is money wordplay works well throughout the film and the story does have enough meat on it to be interesting. As always it does ring a little hypocritical for high paid movie stars to be in a movie that's presents an allegory about how wealthy people should share the wealth with everyone instead of taking it all for themselves, especially when ticket prices for a movie run an average of $9.<br /><br />Timberlake shows that he can act better than many would expect. Too many write him off as little more than a singer but he's turning into one of the few all round entertainers show business has to offer. Seyfried looks gorgeous as always and does a great job when it comes to action as well. Murphy demonstrates that he's not a one note actor, offering a performance of a cop on a mission quite well.<br /><br />On the whole the movie is pure fluff entertainment posing as a message movie. The entertainment offered is substantial but the message is lost and would seem better suited for a Michael Moore movie where he sits in his mansion complaining about how the little people are being ripped off. All in all it's still a good time and worth a rental.ith everyone instead of taking it all for themselves, especially when ticket prices for a movie run an average of $9.<br /><br />Timberlake shows that he can act better than many would expect.

B007BVOF8E|4.0|have read perhaps 11 or so of le carre's books, and the movie keeps faith with them, although nearly every scene is doused with such a gloom that i am wondering if the english can afford light bulbs...alec guinness still my favorite smiley, but gary does him well...le carre's basic message, beginning with his celebrated spy who came in from the cold, has always been the view that the craft of espionage not only leads to no real advantage for anyone but is also a great waste of human spirit...and george is permitted one line that alludes to that in a final scene...a psychological piece at a time the other, bond school of glamor and action, continues to rule...ciao.

B005J4TLQG|5.0|When you've seen as many movies as I have it's rare that one surprises you, which takes you off guard and delivers on the hype that surrounds it. But that's just what happened this week with the release of ATTACK THE BLOCK.<br /><br />The story takes place in a London building project where low income people live in a high rise apartment complex doing the best they can. Among the tenants is a young woman named Sam who is mugged as the film opens by a group of early teens. This gang of sorts begins to take her belongings when a meteor falls from the sky and crashes into a car on the street.<br /><br />Sam makes her getaway with this distraction and gang leader Moses takes a closer look. What he finds inside the car is a small creature with grey skin and sharp claws that takes a swipe at him and runs. The gang follows it and after shooting a few fireworks it's way, kills the creature.<br /><br />Unsure of what they've got on hand they decide it's something they can make money off of selling pictures to some tabloid magazine. The safest place they can think of to hide this discovery is in the complex on the block at the apartment of the local drug dealer. All seems fine until the gang looks out the window to see numerous other meteors landing in the neighborhood. It appears this is a full fledged invasion and these kids aren't about to let their block be taken over.<br /><br />Things begin to change when they witness the first creatures to come out of these meteors though. Rather than the tiny grey skinned being these are fully grown monsters. As the kids describe them they seem like gorilla alien wolf-like things. Yes that's an apt description but worse. The fur covered creatures are an incredibly dark black but present a wide oral opening filled with green glowing teeth. Not only that they're fast too.<br /><br />Moses is picked up by the police who've been driving around with Sam trying to find the gang. After he's handcuffed and tossed in back, the police are attacked and eaten by the aliens who then try to get inside their van. With a little help, Sam and Moses escape and head for the rest of the gang.<br /><br />Now it's on as the gang decides to take on these creatures. Unable to decide if it's just an invasion or if it's something the government has come up with to exterminate the people in the block, they arm themselves with whatever weapons they have and set out to defend the block.<br /><br />The movie offers a nice blend of humor, suspense and sheer terror as the aliens chase the kids up and down the streets and in the apartment complex. This is a night when not everyone will make it out alive and one can only hope their favorite characters live.<br /><br />There's the set up but it doesn't do justice to how good this movie truly is. The photography is fantastic, never making things so dark that you can't tell what's going on or see anything happening. Well lit by street lamps and headlights the creatures are clearly visible rather than the usual thing that happens these days with creatures rarely seen. Here they're quite visible and on screen enough that you get to completely enjoy them.<br /><br />Being able to see the creatures makes this movie. They are at both scary on one hand and interesting to see on the other. You don't want to look away, you want to see them and see them often. Fortunately the film's director agrees and offers plenty of them to watch.<br /><br />The movie doesn't try and pretend to be a serious take on an alien invasion. Instead it goes full out to offer an entertaining look at what might happen if aliens decided to invade the wrong neighborhood. There are plenty of chills and thrills from beginning to end.<br /><br />As I said at the start it's rare for me to find a movie that surprises me or leaves me completely entertained. This movie does the trick. As the end credits rolled and had I had the time I felt like I could have watched it all over again right there and then. It will take a prominent space on my shelf. While most folks will be rushing to watch CAPTAIN AMERICA this week, I would recommend that you track this one down instead. I've seen both films and enjoyed this one much more.minent space on my shelf.

B005J4TLO8|1.0|This could be one of the shortest reviews I've ever written. When a movie is this bad it's hard to find that much to say about it and the plot is so simple that it should take just a paragraph or two.<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg stars as Nick, a pizza delivery boy who uses every trick in the book to get there in time but doesn't always accomplish his task. Aziz Ansari is his room mate and best friend, a teacher who is moving out soon. So much for the set up on that end.<br /><br />Danny McBride is Dwayne, the belittled son of tough as nails rich man Fred Ward. Dwayne wants everything handed to him without work and has big plans that rarely work out. Nick Swarsdon is his sidekick Travis. Together they come up with a plot to get wealthy by robbing a bank without actually being the ones to rob it. They call for a pizza delivery (Nick), knock him unconscious and then strap a bomb to him. When he wakes they tell him he has a limited time to rob the bank and get to a point where they will disable the bomb and take the money.<br /><br />Nick seeks the help of his friend, talks to his friend's sister that he's been dating and does everything he can to get out of this mess. The pair do go through with the robbery but attempt to change the way it plays out before meeting to give up the cash.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer for this I thought it had possibilities. Too bad the best moments were all found in that trailer. Once again we have a group of characters we could care less about. It must be the new trend in Hollywood.<br /><br />Worst of all to me was McBride. The first few things I saw him in I thought he had potential. Now it seems that each role he takes requires him to talk as vulgar as he can, act nasty as possible and think its all funny. It isn't and neither is this movie.

B0058ZPNOK|2.0|Whenever I hear about a group of critics giving high praise to a movie I immediately am fearful that the movie will be terrible. Most critics tend to look at the \\"artistic\\" merit of a film and toss out the entire idea that it should be entertaining. Some go so far as to feel that if a movie entertains it has failed in its mission to articulate some big idea. These same critics fail to realize that most people plopping down anywhere from $5 to $10 to see a movie or even $1 to rent it want something for their money and most want to be entertained. So it was I was concerned when I read high praise for the movie HESHER. Still, I wanted to see it for myself.<br /><br />I'll start by saying there were things I liked about HESHER and there were things I hated about it. Did it entertain? In some ways, yes but for the most part it just seemed determined to either offend or show those who would be offended just how uncool they really are. Call me square I guess.<br /><br />Devin Brochu stars as young T.J., a boy dealing with the loss of his mother. We don't discover this for sure until later in the film but in having him race his bike chasing a crashed car being towed away you kind of figure it out early on. T.J. isn't the only one having trouble dealing with the loss. His father Paul (Rainn Wilson) tends to sit around the house, deep into anti-depressants and doing very little. Only T.J.'s grandmother (Piper Laurie) seems to have any life left in her and she's much older than she acts.<br /><br />T.J. seems to find himself in trouble most of the time, especially at school. It's there he runs afoul of the school bully, a youngster who works at the junkyard where T.J.'s crashed family car was taken. Avoiding this bully, T.J. ends up at a housing project and in an act of anger tosses a rock through a window of a house being built. Before he can toss another, out walks a straggly looking vagrant who we learn later is named Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  When security shows, Hesher tosses a grenade their way after informing T.J. that T.J. screwed him over.<br /><br />Later T.J. sees the same black van Hesher was driving following him, eventually stopping in front of his house. Turning from the window, T.J. finds Hesher in his living room, apparently squatting there now since his last \\"home\\" was taken away. The oddest thing is that no one seems to tell Hesher he has to leave except T.J. who is threatened.<br /><br />Life goes on this way with Hesher witness to all sorts of violent acts against T.J. He never steps in as they occur, but he does later doing things like setting the school bully's car on fire. It's Hesher's way of forcing T.J. to stand up for himself but at the same time shows nothing less than total anarchy. But that's Hesher's character, one who lives for the moment and for the most part thinks only of himself. But not always.<br /><br />T.J. eventually befriends a young woman named Nicole (Natalie Portman) who works as a clerk at the local grocery store. For some reason he connects with her, using her as a substitute for his deceased mother. Their friendship grows but seems just as odd as his strange friendship with Hesher. A later betrayal in T.J.'s eyes leads the two to part ways with the hope of it ending better before the final reel.<br /><br />The movie crawls along at a steady yet slow seeming pace with little to find attractive in it. Everything has a murky brown, cluttered feel to it. And while you feel an amount of sympathy for the lead characters, you eventually just want to yell get on with it. Hesher, the anti-hero we should be thrilled to root for just seems like a malcontent who helps people only when it benefits himself.<br /><br />I read someone say that this felt like an update of SHANE. I disagree. In that film we had a lawbreaker who lived with his gun that came along and helped a family find themselves. In this one we have a lawbreaker more inclined to fit the Jack Palance character in SHANE, the evil gunslinger who lived only for himself.<br /><br />There is one thing to like in this film and that's the acting. Brochu turns in a fine performance for a young actor, but it would have been nice to see him do more than scream. They even reference that in the gag reel included in the special section. I think Rainn Wilson is a terrific actor, but he's wasted here doing little more than look pained and depressed from start to finish. Levitt is the one to watch here. Remembering him when he was a child star and seeing him develop into an actor worth watching is remarkable.<br /><br />So if the acting was the best thing what was the worst? The script. To me it's becoming clich&eacute; to portray the world as one big cesspool, an ugly place where nothing but ugly things happen. The script also uses what I consider to be the laziest thing possible, using vulgar language for shock value. To hear Hesher talk to T.J. about using various appendages and inserting them into various orifices isn't funny, amusing or helps develop the character though I'm sure many will think it does. To me it just gets in the way of the story and when used as often as it is here it distracts rather than helps. I've been known to toss out an expletive a time or two, but here it wasn't needed.<br /><br />The other bad item is Natalie Portman being completely wasted here. Her part seems like more of a cameo than an honest role. One scene becomes crucial to the development of T.J.'s life, but other than that her part could have been phoned in.<br /><br />So on the whole while I enjoyed the performances of some of the cast, I felt that this movie lacked in far too many areas. The rebel without a clue idea has been done better and has been overused. The ideas of what makes a character the cool one here has nothing to do with values and everything to do with self satisfaction. And in the end this film commits the worst mistake of not being entertaining.linger who lived only for himself.<br /><br />There is one thing to like in this film and that's the acting.

B005HT400A|4.0|It's hard to believe it's been 25 years since BLUE VELVET set of a national controversy over what should and shouldn't be seen on screen. Couple that with what's been released since and it seems almost appears quaint. And yet it still has the ability to shock and make you feel ill at ease while watching it.<br /><br />The film opens with an idyllic scene in a small town: kids playing outside, the fire truck driving by with waving firemen on it and a man out watering his lawn. But this same man has a heart attack, falls and the camera then slowly moves into the grass to see a swarm of ants moving around frantically. This was a world director David Lynch was trying to let us understand, a world where things always seem normal on the surface but lying just beneath was a topsy turvy world where something just odd enough to seem evil was going on.<br /><br />Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle McLachlen) returns home from college to help out after his father's heart attack. While walking home from the hospital after visiting his father, he comes across a severed ear in a vacant lot, He takes the ear to the local police and detective Williams assures him that he'll look into it. Stopping at Williams home later, he meets his daughter Sandy (Laura Dern). Sandy tells Jeffrey that she overheard her father talking about a woman who was under investigation that the ear might be tied to, a woman named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini).<br /><br />Their curiosity raised, the young couple decide to look into the matter on their own. They visit a local club where Vallens sings and decide to go further with it. Jeffrey poses as an exterminator and goes into Vallens apartment to set it up so he can get in later. He does so leaving Sandy downstairs to watch for Vallens. Unable to hear Sandy's car horn he hides when he hears Vallens enter her apartment. Watching voyeuristically from the closet, he watches her undress and listens to her phone conversation. Bumping into a coat hanger he is caught and forced from the closet at knife point.<br /><br />Vallens questions him, knowing for sure that there must be some reason he is here, something to do with other things happening in her life. A knock at the door and she pushes him back into the closet then lets in the man from the phone, Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). Jeffrey watches as Frank degrades Vallens, inhales gas from a tank and then rapes her. He then leaves and Jeffrey comforts Vallens.<br /><br />This leads to a story that goes down separate yet intertwining paths. The one has Jeffrey talking about the things he learns with Sandy while trying to find out what is going on, the second is his involvement with Vallens. Vallens and Jeffrey's relationship is sexual but she has a knack for sado-masochism that both frightens and yet excites Jeffrey.<br /><br />Jeffrey begins to follow Booth and to see what he's up to. With information from Sandy he knows that this man is both dangerous and somehow involved in most of the crime that takes place in town yet for some reason he's never been caught. As he leaves Vallens one night, he runs into Booth and his crew just outside the apartment. They take Jeffrey on a nightmare ride through the strange world that Booth inhabits and leave him beaten and worse for wear at the end of the night.<br /><br />Jeffrey is left to decide what to do. Does he get out while he can or try to save a woman he has concerns for but doesn't love? Does he love Sandy or was he merely using her? And what about the strange way he's been behaving lately?<br /><br />Lynch has always looked at the world differently than most people. All of his movies reflect this but perhaps none quite as much as BLUE VELVET. As with the ants at the beginning of the film, he wants us to take note that the world may appear one way on the surface but lying just beneath that is a world that is filled with brutality and things we'd rather not know about or witness. And yet a certain amount of curiosity exists in us all where we want to at least take a peek at that world.<br /><br />When the film was initially released it caused quite a stir. First and foremost because of the in your face brutality of the Frank Booth character whose vicious expletive infected rants seemed cartoonish and frightening at the same time. This was someone you never wanted to meet. But the most controversial aspect was the performance of Rossellini who was subjected to the brutality of Booth. While a great performance, many critics were shocked that Lynch would subject an actress to this sort of thing. It went so far as to have nationally syndicated critics Ebert and Siskel debate the validity of the movie and the roles with Siskel defending it as art and Ebert decrying it as inhuman (which if you've ever seen BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS which Ebert co-wrote makes you wonder why he didn't feel that way earlier).<br /><br />The film continues to hold its status as shocking to this day. Perhaps not quite as much after having been exposed to films like HOSTEL since then, but it still can take you back. The performances of both Rossellini and Hopper are amazing. Hopper's Frank Booth has become a film icon, a bad guy that movie fans know by name and deservedly so.<br /><br />Lynch hasn't done much lately and that's sad. His movies were thought provoking if nothing else. At least we still have what he's done in the past to watch. The blu-ray release here also contains a number of items including making of documentaries and a clip from AT THE MOVIES which featured the discussion between Ebert and Siskel. Fans of Lynch will want to add this to their collection. All others may want to watch it but be aware of the violent world in which you are about to enter.l where we want to at least take a peek at that world.<br /><br />When the film was initially released it caused quite a stir.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book is about a very frightening topic as a parent - the narrator's son is accused of murder.  I spent the whole book hoping the kid would be exonerated.  The problem with this novel is the mom isn't totally believable.  When it comes out that the 14 year old son has a history of violence, can't empathize and steals, the dad minimizes it and says the kid is normal.  This is believable.  The dad is in denial and won't discipline his son.  He's an ineffective dad, but believable.  The mom on the other hand, sees the same behaviors, gets no support from the husband and throws up her hands.  When she says he steals she says, what can you do?  You can't cut his hands off.  If this were a real mom who's verbal as this character is, she'd make sure the family went to therapy.  The kid is portrayed as beyond help, and the only solution is for the mom to kill him as a loving act.  This is horrible.  The family never did anything to try to help the kid, and the message is that it's okay to give up and kill some kids.  I sure hope the author doesn't have any kids - he may be dangerous.
B005TBQS0Q|3.0|It's been 25 years since Robin Williams starred in GOOD MORNING VIETNAM just being released on blu-ray. The movie was based on the life of Adrian Cronauer, an Air Force officer who changed the way the military ran radio during the Vietnam War. At least that's what I think most of us thought the movie was about. But it turns out to be more about a comedian run wild in a starring role than about what happened in Vietnam.<br /><br />Williams stars as Cronauer, in this case an officer hand picked by Gen. Taylor (Noble Willingham) to bring his humor to the approved radio station the military runs for the troops. To date that station has had flat sounding DJs who play nothing more exciting than a polka. Cronauer changes that by playing rock and roll, the music that most of the soldier in the field listened to before they were brought to this country.<br /><br />This runs counter to the man in charge, Sgt. Major Dickinson (J.T.Walsh) and his right hand man Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby). They see no problems with the way things have been and so take offense to the new guy. But with the General backing him, Cronauer's personality runs wild on the air and he breathes fresh air into the style and content of the show he does. It also infects the other on air talent and makes them step up their game as well.<br /><br />As he gets used to his new situation Cronauer is aided by Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker). Garlick advises him of the way things are run, how to get around things on occasion and introduces him to the locals, the females of which are of particular interest to Cronauer. One in particular strikes his fancy and in an attempt to woo her, he takes over a class being taught to the locals on how to speak English. This leads to his meeting the young woman's brother and her family.<br /><br />The back and forth between enlisted talent and military officials continues. Cronauer has little or no idea of what is actually happening or how popular he's become. But he gets a wake up call when the local bar is bombed by members of the Vietcong. He sees the devastation and realizes that there is a war going on. This change in observation affects Cronauer in such a way that he reads a news brief uncensored for once on the air causing another major rift with the powers that be.<br /><br />The movie presented to us shows a man who took matters into his own hands and stood for what he believed. It also shows a spastic comedic presence on the air that eventually saw the good he was doing. But the fact is that when you take the time to watch the extras included on this disc you realize the whole character of Adrian Cronauer is less Adrian and more Robin Williams and that's always been one of my biggest problems when watching Williams act.<br /><br />Catch phrases and bits and pieces of his stand up routines always find a way into the roles he plays unless he has a director that takes hold of him and actually directs his talent which he has in abundance. But left unchecked and unharnessed Williams spastic interpretations of characters seem less like a person being portrayed and more like, well Williams performing as a comedian. Suddenly the story of Adrian Cronauer (though one would assume he was well paid for his story) is less what this is about and more about Williams being himself.<br /><br />In those extras director Barry Levinson says that the amount of time showing Williams on air antics amounts to less than 14 minutes. But those 14 minutes are the most alive in the film and were used in the advertising campaigns when the film came out to the point where that's the parts you remember. But there are many other times in the film that it feels more Robin and less Adrian.<br /><br />This was the first time I'd watched this film since seeing it 25 years ago. While it is still an enjoyable film it continues to grate on me that it seems more stand up than biopic. Williams has the ability to be a dynamic actor. To this day I felt that he deserved an Oscarfor his performance in THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. But when he's turned lose and allowed to use his stand up in a role that doesn't need it, it distracts rather than enhances. The movie is worth watching to see a developing talent and an interesting story but I for one would have liked to see something more about the real Adrian Cronauer and less about Robin Williams.for his performance in THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.

Not appropriate for the much younger set, but nothing most pre-teens haven't encountered.  Her voice is fabulous and even more so with surround sound.  Enjoy....

B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I've always said that one of the true benefits of DVDs is the chance to see your favorite TV series whenever you want to. Not only that but it gives series a chance to be seen, especially when one series is programmed against another. Series that at one time might have died off because no one watched their second season gain viewers when people see the first season on DVD and realize what they were missing. After 6 seasons that might not be the case with CRIMINAL MINDS, but for those who've never been exposed now is the time with the release of season 6 on DVD. Don't worry if you're starting here, the series is easy to get into.<br /><br />If you've never seen the series it follows the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit), a specialized group of profilers at the FBI that tracks down serial criminals, usually killers. A profiler is a trained agent skilled in the psychology of the criminal mind, a person who attempts to track down the killer by getting in their head. And this team is the best there is.<br /><br />The BAU is led by agent Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson),  a dedicated individual who guards his team as well as possible. The team also has David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), an ex-agent turned author who came back to join this team. Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) is the most physical of the team while also the most emotional. Jennifer Jareau (A.J.Cook) is the team's press liaison and case organizer. Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) is an effective thinker and effective interrogator. Dr. Spencer Reed (Matthew Gray Gubler) is a young genius with an analytical mind that sees patterns where others can not. And rounding out the team is  Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness), a computer whiz who stays in constant touch with the team where ever they are, finding information for them when in need.<br /><br />The thing about this team is that not only do they seem like a working group of agents, there is a closeness about them as well. If you continue to watch the series you'll get a sense of family about them. Each one has his role, though not in the sense of father or sister. Instead you get the feeling of familiarity between characters and once hooked on the series with viewers as well. That was seen in this season when one of the characters left and viewer outcry resulted in her return this year.<br /><br />So you have the set up of the series, agents tracking down criminals, flying here and there ready to take on any and all bad guys. So what happens this season that hasn't before? It opens with the second of two parts, finalizing the cliffhanger from season 5. The Prince of Darkness killer has returned for some unknown reason and takes the life of a policeman before the team can take him out of play. This results in the daughter of the policeman becoming the responsibility of Derek which comes into play in several of the episodes.<br /><br />As I stated, one of the agents is forced to move up in the FBI though she'd rather not. This results in several situations for the team; having to deal with her departure, trying to take over her responsibilities and eventually finding another member for the team. Again, this takes place over several episodes but contributes to the sense of loss for the team and for viewers.<br /><br />Various cases offer bloody situations and extreme violence not usually shown on TV. Then again we're talking about serial killers for the most part and their actions are almost always violent. So a word to the wise when choosing who should and shouldn't be watching this show. Adults will have no problem but younger children might.<br /><br />The acting is unbelievable for having a cast this size. Each member is given equal opportunity to shine and not one stands above the rest. They all form believable characters that long term viewers grow to care about. Should you choose to watch you will too.<br /><br />The season ends with a twist that few saw coming. Will it result in the loss or return of a character? What actually happened? And will we find out the answer come next season? No one knows except the writers who will let us know at their leisure. Until then we'll have to content ourselves by having the chance to watch this season over and over again, viewing our favorite episodes and enjoying those not quite on our list. It doesn't matter because there isn't an episode that isn't done well.<br /><br />With the frightening fact that there are at any time dozens if not hundreds of potential serial killers out there, its nice to know that a team like this actually exist. Let's hope for two things. The first, that they're as successful as the team here is. The second, that those killers remain only \\"potential\\" knowing that the team is out there. This is a series not to be missed and one of the best TV has to offer right now.appened? And will we find out the answer come next season?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm in my 50's, so reading a book that is targeted primarily to young adults was not something that I planned.  I started reading out of curiousity because i had seen the movie previews and it looked very interesting.  Ok, I ended up reading all three books in less than two days!  Fantastic read and amazing story is all I can say now!

I like the way you get a quote or whatever when you make an element.<br /><br />As a side note, an option to not display or not allow duplicate combinations would be helpful.

B004EPYZXU|2.0|Ever since THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT \\"lost footage\\" movies have become a genre unto themselves. Some have done well at the box office, some have received no notice and others just exist. Then there are films like APOLLO 18 that use the device well but just sit there.<br /><br />APOLLO 18 is supposed to be comprised of footage that was secreted away after the failed expedition to the moon. So secret was the mission that the blast off was hidden as a mission to launch a satellite rather than a trip to the moon. Even the astronaut's families weren't told they were going to the moon.<br /><br />All goes well at first. The team gets into space without a problem. The two man team landing on the moon's surface have a bit of difficulty but manage to land without a hitch. The moon rover works fine and they collect samples without error. But something goes wrong eventually.<br /><br />The two men on the surface come across another space ship on the moon. This one is Russian and something happened. To begin with, no one knew that this ship was here or even that the Russian's launched a moon expedition. Secondly, the interior of the ship has been trashed. After a bit of searching, the pair follows footsteps that lead them to the dead cosmonaut, his suit ripped and his helmet smashed.<br /><br />Other odd things happen as well. A moon rock supposedly locked away in storage is found in the landing module. The flag they planted disappears. And eventually one of the astronauts comes down with some space disease where he sees things and is wounded.<br /><br />What could have been a film that makes you wonder are they really seeing things or are they hallucinating becomes instead a movie that lets you have glimpses that yes indeed, there are creatures on the moon. These start with things we viewers see in the periphery of the cameras lens, items that are just at the rims of our visibility. Something moves or something falls and while the main characters aren't aware we most certainly are.<br /><br />Eventually the question is posed will NASA try to bring these men back or leave them stranded in space? Will they allow them to die fearing what they might bring back to Earth or will they rescue them?<br /><br />As with another lost footage film, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, this one plays off the spooks of being stranded in a world where you have no control over what's happening around you. Unlike that film it doesn't really scare you or make you jump with the exception of one loud noise that surprises you. Whoopee.<br /><br />Confined to a small cabin and a few feet of the moon's surface, the movie feels cramped and stagnant like the air in the capsule. It doesn't offer enough scares to frighten and doesn't develop the characters enough to make you feel concern for their plight. Sure we see scenes of them with their families at the beginning but since it was more like home movies we don't get enough chance to form a bond with them. In so doing we end up just not caring.<br /><br />At the end of the day APOLLO 18 just doesn't hold up. It never holds your interest enough. The scares just aren't scary. The \\"real life footage\\" feels repetitive and the items at the edges make you feel more like you're playing Where's Waldo rather than seeing some creature in a space capsule.<br /><br />If you feel the need to see all movies that qualify as horror or all movies that are the \\"lost footage\\" genre, then you'll want to rent this one. If not there are plenty of other good movies worth renting. Long before the end of this one I could tell that it was one I'd never watch again.re.<br /><br />Eventually the question is posed will NASA try to bring these men back or leave them stranded in space?

1564148793|5.0|I really love this book. While some other reviewers have put it down because it's eclectic or places \\"too much\\" emphasis on the Goddess Hekate, I feel that the eclectic nature and emphasis on Hekate are among its many strengths.<br /><br />Too often we Witches and other magickians get into the mindset, encouraged by some Wicca 101 books (that blatantly ignore dark magick and curses), that we're safe because of angels or our own auras, which is not the case. Jason Miller clearly demonstrates the need for protection and reversal magick, and true to his mission defines for the more advanced practice reader how to accomplish this protection.<br /><br />A word of warning: This book is for practitioners who know what they're doing and have developed their gifts to a good extent. While you don't need to be an Adept to use these techniques and many techniques, such as the meditation, banishings, and offerings can be done by just about anybody, the more advanced material is best left alone by the lay audience.<br /><br />I very much appreciate that there is a book that \\"fills the gaps\\" between what I learned from other books and personal practice and what I need to know in terms of psychic and magickal protection and reversal, especially one above the 101 level that doesn't \\"talk down\\" to me.<br /><br />As I said, I think that in drawing from various magickal traditions as well as from his own vast experience that Jason Miller has created an even more potent work for his readers, many of whom have never encountered hoodoo from the southern US or Santeria, etc. Many readers will have come from Wicca or Ceremonial traditions, which have very different takes on magick, however need to know the same things in that even magick we do not know about can affect us. We all need to be protected from the dark.<br /><br />I already have a solid meditation and banishing practice, however am going to start my offerings today. Great job Jason!

B004LWZWC4|5.0|It's always a pleasure to find a movie that you thought would be terrible and being proven wrong. After the disaster that was GULLIVER'S TRAVELS I was certain that THE BIG YEAR starring Jack Black would be another travesty of film with him mugging for the camera the same way he always does. Instead I found a delightful film that I know I could watch again and enjoy.<br /><br />Black stars as Brad Harris, a birder (bird viewing enthusiast) with an uncanny ability to know a bird by the song it sings. The main even for bird viewers is known as a Big Year, a year long event where they try to see as many species of birds as they can. When this 36 year old gets news his ex-wife is remarrying he decides this is the year to take time off from work to fulfill his lifelong wish to do a Big Year.<br /><br />Stu Preissler (Steve Martin) has decided to retire for the second time from the multinational corporation he is CEO of. While the executives in charge want him to stay on, he too has decided that this is the best opportunity he will have to do his own Big Year. With his wife's blessings, he heads out to start watching.<br /><br />Which leaves our third main character Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson). Kenny holds the record for the highest number of birds seen, over 800. His is the record to beat and one that he holds dear. So much so that he puts his record above everything else in his life including his wife (Rosamund Pike) and her desire to have children.<br /><br />When word gets out the to bird crowd about a major even bringing thousands of species to one location, they all head to begin their counts. Bumping into one another on a boat, Brad and Stu strike up a friendship based on their love of birds neither one admitting to doing a Big Year. As the sightings escalate and they run into one another more often, they get closer and finally Brad admits what he is doing. But Stu holds back.<br /><br />But Kenny recognizes what's happening and tries to play the two friends off of one another slowing them down in their quest at the same time. This enables him to continue on and attempt to set a new world record. But fences are mended and the friends continue to try and beat the already established record.<br /><br />Along the way Brad faces two more challenges. One is his father (Brian Dennehy) a blue collar man who can't understand his son's quest. He considers him to be a failure rather than a man who has a chance to take the crown from Kenny. Brad also finds himself falling in love with another birder, a young woman who can make bird calls better than anyone he meets. Unfortunately he discovers she has a boyfriend. Along with the birding itself, these two stumbling blocks offer plot devices that fit nicely into the whole story going on.<br /><br />Each of these three men comes from various financial backgrounds and families, each has their strengths and weaknesses and each has a goal in mind when it comes to their Big Year. But as the story unfolds we not only have the chance to witness some breath taking scenery but to get a fully flushed out story involving all three characters.<br /><br />My biggest fear as I began this film was the actors. Black, Martin and Wilson have all had films in the past where a director's complete lack of control resulted in an actor taking over and ruining the production, trying to use their usual shtick thinking it was funny when in truth it had become boring. None of that exists here. Both Black and Martin give exceptional performances and flush out their characters to the fullest without resorting to the old standby laugh getters. Instead we have characters that we care about and who we hope will remain friends. Wilson's character is the saddest of the three without his own being aware of it. One hopes he will one day find the joy the other two achieve by the end of the film.<br /><br />Don't let the simple concept of this film fool you. It offers so much more than one would think a movie about watching birds could. It also offers Black a chance at redemption in my book, giving him the chance to actually act rather than play the buffoon. Let's just hope he continues to do so.ds could. It also offers Black a chance at redemption in my book, giving him the chance to actually act rather than play the buffoon. Let's just hope he continues to do so.

B005D81W5Q|3.0|Let me begin by saying that I'm not a fan of the latest craze in movie comedy. For some reason the success of one movie that featured extreme vulgarity (THE HANGOVER) has resulted in numerous movies being released that seem to think the funniest parts were due to the rudeness of the language or visuals used. The fact is the funny parts commented on those items or around them but they were never the funny parts. That being said is BAD TEACHER a funny movie? In short, yes.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz stars as Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher with little to offer. She's just marking time until she gets married to a rich available husband. While this is supposed to be her last year, her engagement collapses and she returns the next. Looking for a solution she decides that the reason she can't catch a top notch available male is because her breasts aren't big enough. She opts for augmentation but can't afford it and thus the main idea behind the movie kicks in, her trying to find a way to make the money.<br /><br />At the school an overachieving teacher is found across the hall from Elizabeth. Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) is that do gooder type person who is filled with all sorts of goofy sayings and feel good quotes. Yes, she's most obnoxious. And of course Elizabeth takes an immediate disliking to her.<br /><br />Falling in between the two is new substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who happens to be the grandson of an expensive watch maker. The dollar signs flash and Elizabeth is ready to set her trap. Unfortunately for her Amy makes her move first and the competition is on.<br /><br />While this is happening Elizabeth does her best to make it through each day failing to inspire or teach any student who happens to fall in her path. Instead she simply plugs in the TV and shows her class movies that involved teachers like STAND AND DELIVER and LEAN ON ME. When she discovers that the teacher who has the students with the highest grades in a state wide test wins a check for over $5,000 she makes the decision to start teaching and hope it works.<br /><br />Complications and skullduggery come into play as well as a revenge seeking Amy. But along the way Elizabeth ends up helping some of her students. She helps them find their way through the terrible time known as Junior High. And she finds something more in herself as well. She also happens to unknowingly find someone else in the school's gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel). How it all ends makes for some funny moments.<br /><br />So the story along with the numerous laughs interspersed throughout is the good part. What's the bad? If you were paid a quarter for every time the F bomb or vulgar word for breasts were uttered you would be able to fill a theater with patrons. For some reason Hollywood seems to think this makes it funnier. It doesn't and the shock value wore off on me back in Junior High when that sort of thing was funny. Granted there are occasion when the words can elicit some great laughs (think PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES or George Carlin's famous piece on the 7 dirty words) but when its just tossed in over and over it becomes annoying.<br /><br />Diaz does a decent job here but she needs to rely on more than her looks to get her through a movie. While watching her talk about trying to save up enough money for plastic surgery one can't help but wonder if she's had her face done and if so where did that cash come from? Timberlake is showing that he can actually act and do a good job in comedy and drama. A Segel is a wonder, offering a subtle portrayal here of a goofy yet loveable guy. His is the most realistic portrayal of the bunch. Punch shows that she has the chops to pull of some great comedic moments and is someone I'm looking forward to seeing again. After some great bit parts in some hilarious movies its nice to see her star rising.<br /><br />All in all if you can get past the language barrier this movie is funny more often than not. But know aheadof time if you are easily offended then this is not the movie for you. For everyone else, sit back and have a laugh.of time if you are easily offended then this is not the movie for you. For everyone else, sit back and have a laugh.

Can someone please let me know what is going on here.<br /><br />My whole family is enamored with the series and I have both Season 1 & 2 but the second season I got did NOT have the Christmas version on it.

I crossed my fingers when Season 2 arrived but it was fine BUT I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CHRISTMAS EPISODE WAS NOT THERE! So here I am again with two versions ordered and got one returned, paid hugely for second one and it still DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY.<br /><br />I have a very good new Panasonic Blu Ray and can watch Seasons 1 and 2 now with loving care but NOT the Christmas one!!!

B0068MNNOE|4.0|It's amazing the stories that come up and even more so to think that they are all completely original. Some say there are truly only several different stories available to tell but that these 3-4 are embellished enough to make them different. Then there are the classics, the tales told for what seems like forever. Take for instance Shakespeare. His plays and sonnets are considered the best ever written in the English language. But what if he wasn't the actual author?<br /><br />There are historical discussions on just this topic and that's where the inspiration for the movie ANONYMOUS comes from. It takes the idea that Shakespeare was actually illiterate and that someone else wrote everything he is credited with.<br /><br />Edward De Vere, the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans) is an aristocrat dedicated to his queen, Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave). But he sees those around her manipulating things to the way they wish them to be as opposed to what is best for England. It seems that the Queen takes the word and influence of William Cecil (David Thewliss) more than that of anyone and past history has yielded De Vere and Cecil as mortal enemies even though De Vere is married to Cecil's daughter.<br /><br />De Vere is a man of words as well as action. It is through these words that he has always reached the Queen. The movie moves forward and back in time showing them as subject and royalty and also as lovers. But there are dark secrets looming which aren't revealed until much later. The movie is filled with secrets and plotting turning what would at first seem the tale of Shakespeare into a political thriller instead.<br /><br />Watching the lowly crowds during performances of plays De Vere realizes the power one could have by controlling this crowd. They react to the words being performed but none is enough to spark them or inspire them. He has those words and the ability to write them but his position prevents him from doing so. Instead he hires playwright Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armento) to produce the plays he writes using his name instead. Johnson backs out on the deal though, releasing the play as written by Anonymous. When the crowd calls for the author actor William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), who knows of the deal, steps forward to take credit where it isn't due.<br /><br />The plays continue to be written and performed and the crowd can't get enough. And in various stories they can see that they relate to things happening in England, slightly camouflaged but not quite enough to hide their true meaning. At the same time the members of the Queen's court are made aware as well and manipulations are implemented to sway her majesty. The center of their disagreement lies in an heir to the throne. Elizabeth has no legitimate children to inherit the crown and Cecil wants to insert James, the son of Mary and a Scot. Those who believe that only a true Englishman should rule are seeking someone else.<br /><br />The behind the scenes wheeling and dealing, the deceptions that come into play and the final twist in this story make for an interesting film. With so many characters with so many titles, it becomes slightly confusing at times but not enough to take away from the story going on. Instead it's like watching one of the classic BBC series that used the same subject matter just turning it into a 2 hour film rather than a month long series.<br /><br />The acting is amazing. As always to me the sign of a fantastic actor is one who so immerses himself in the role that you never even consider that someone is acting but accept them as that person. Ifans does an amazing job setting so into the role that you would barely recognize him from previous films. The supporting cast does an extremely great job as well and casting Joely Richardson to play the young Queen while her mother portrays the aging Queen was a smart move.<br /><br />The film may not be for everyone. It offers little to no action or true comedy. Instead it tells a possibility thatmay have existed in history, the true author of the plays of Shakespeare and their real reason for being written. It offers intrigue to the fullest extent making current spy movies seem rather cumbersome and this one more filled with finesse. It's an interesting movie that will entertain you if you give it a chance and perhaps influence you to look deeper. The question of who actually wrote the plays is still in doubt and argued by scholars around the world. Watching a movie like this could inspire you to look deeper into finding an answer.may have existed in history, the true author of the plays of Shakespeare and their real reason for being written.

B006OFN0SE|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing the movie J. EDGAR. I was never a fan of the man it was about, but with all the information brought out over the years about the secretive man who managed to create perhaps the most effective law enforcement organization ever I thought there should be a great story to be told here. There still is but this isn't the movie that does so.<br /><br />For those who don't know the name, J. Edgar Hoover was the creator of and the driving force behind the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for decades. Not only was he the man responsible for putting the bureau together, he ran it when America was under attack by subversives, during the depression when criminals seemed more famous than those tracking them and later on when the FBI took on the Mafia at the behest of Attorney General Robert Kennedy.<br /><br />The film takes us through the various stages of Hoover's life from his early start at working for the Attorney General when the first outcry of radical attacks came. Still living at home Hoover was heavily influenced by his mother (played here by Judi Dench). It was her desire to see her son reinvigorate the Hoover name once again in Washington and he eventually did so.<br /><br />We watch as Hoover moves back and forth through time as he narrates passages of his memoirs to a subordinate taking us to those times when events actually happened. Along with these memories we get a chance to see Hoover for who he was as well, especially the man who witnessed so many politicians attempt to use the bureau for political reasons that he established a series if private files he kept on any and all people in power to use against them should they stand in his way. Had that been the main force behind the story here it would have been much more interesting.<br /><br />Instead writer Dustin Lance Black and director Clint Eastwood seem more interested in the seedier side of Hoover's life. In doing so the story of the man behind the FBI becomes a love story more than anything else. And that love story revolves around the tabloid fed stories about Hoover being gay and involved with his trusted friend Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). There is little doubt according to some that they were involved but why make that the focus especially when stating in so many press releases that it wasn't?<br /><br />The story that develops here does come through in the idea that Hoover became obsessed with his ideas that Communists were attempting to subvert the country that he loved; that more than anything portrays him as the patriot that he was, a man who loved his country above all else. But rather than show that yes, there were subversives who attempted to overthrow this country that were caught, it appears there were more civil rights violations going on that deserved more coverage. Granted Hoover was wrong on many of these occasions, but to display one side without the other seems disingenuous.<br /><br />We never see scenes of Hoover and Tolson in locked embrace or in bed together but much is made of their affection for one another. There is one brief heated kiss but that's all. Perhaps that was a gesture towards the fact that what went on behind closed doors was only known for certain to Hoover and Tolson themselves. But the longing for one another takes up more than half of the screen time seen here and for me made the picture more boring than anything.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio does a fantastic job portraying Hoover throughout the various ages seen here. While some would credit the make up artists for much of that portrayal, more goes into it than that. How a man walks, how he talks, how he carries himself in various stages of life bring out the character being portrayed and DiCaprio displays that here.<br /><br />Hoover was an interesting man. His change from law defender to law breaker is interesting. His efforts to create the best crime fighting organization is interesting. His love life is not. I have yet to fathom thedesire of Hollywood and their goal to dismantle each and every hero we have in our past. They seem determined to talk less about the accomplishments made by everyone from Thomas Jefferson to Hoover and more inclined to talk about the salacious details of their lives. Perhaps they've become influenced by the commercials that once ran for THE ENQUIRER that said \\"Enquiring minds want to know\\". I for one do not. I'm much more appreciative of movies that cover all bases and spend less time on dirt.desire of Hollywood and their goal to dismantle each and every hero we have in our past.

The home office just doesn't have the money to compete with bigger cities that offer bigger paychecks. So how can a team that spends close to $30 million compete with a team that costs $130 million?<br /><br />Billy finds the answer by sheer chance. While discussing possible trades in Cleveland he watches as the head men keep deferring to a fresh looking young guy named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Cornering him later on Brand explains to him that teams far too often look for players rather than points. They seek out and pay stars for their attraction quotient but never look to see if they can justify their salaries with their abilities. Brand believes that a great team could be made of semi-decent players, but players who score runs.<br /><br />Beane embraces the idea much to the consternation of the talent scouts and the team's coach Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He bypasses their recommendations and instead puts together a team based on stats that Peter puts together for him. In so doing he believes the team may have no major stars but they will have a winning season. Too bad everyone attempts to stop him rather than go along.<br /><br />Beane and Howe butt heads as to who will play where and when. Eventually Beane puts Howe into a position where he has no option but to place the players he wants where he wants them. That's when the team suddenly begins to win and win big going so far as to break previous records of consistent wins.<br /><br />Based on the book of the same name, MONEYBALL is an interesting film about a subject that along with apple pie is near and dear to the hearts of most American's, baseball. We romanticize about the players; we celebrate the victories and losses of our favorite teams. But how many people actually consider what it takes to put together a winning team? That is the main subject behind this film.<br /><br />But it's more than discussing the choice of winning versus the romantic notion of pure athleticism that makes us love the game. The movie is about a man pushed into a corner who needs to find a way to bring home a winning team without being able to spend the money that bigger cities can afford and who more or less succeeds in doing so. After Beane went on to create this format other teams followed with more success.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is an actor that could easily fall back on his good looks and make movies that offer little depth but plenty of eye candy for the ladies. Instead he takes risks now and then with movies that show he is a better actor than many would give him credit for. The subtle style he offers here as Beane makes you believe you are watching the man instead of an actor portraying him and that's the sign of an actor worth watching.<br /><br />Hill steps out of the comic foil he's played in nearly every movie he's ever made. Instead he's the straight man here, the character (based on several real life individuals) that comes up with the plan that just might save the A's. He never gives this performance the same old styling that he's used before, instead making this character as believable as Pitt's Beane.<br /><br />You don't have to be a baseball fanatic to enjoy this movie but it wouldn't hurt. More action takes place off the field than on. In any event what you will end up with is an evening's entertainment that is worth the effort to take the movie home. Not only will you want to consider renting this one, it might actually be worth adding to your collection. I know I'll be watching it more than once.e movie home.

B0000JCFPE|4.0|I'm back with another movie review these reviews have to do with movies made in either 2002 or 1992. This is 20 Years Ago Basic Instinict. Now I saw this a couple of days ago I remember watching it 10 or 11 years ago & not liking it. Seeing it again I can say this is a good movie. Basic Instinict was directed by Paul Verohen he directed Total Recall, Robocop, & Starship Troopers. It stars Michael Douglas as Detective Nick Curran, Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell, George Dzunaza as Gus Moran, Jeanne Tripllehorn as Dr Beth Garner Daniel von Bargen as Lieutenant Marty Nielsen, Lilani Sarelle as Roxy & Dorthy Malone as Hazel Dobkins. Story is the cops are investigating a murder scene of an ex rock star 2 Cops Detective Nick Curran & Gus Moran are trying to figure out who did it. The only suspect they have is Catherine Tramell. During a meeting at the department they find out that Catherine Tramell has written several novels in 1 of the books a guy is killed the same way that Johnny Boz is which raises a red flag. So Detective Curran & Gus take her to The PD to question her. Of course this is where we get the famous interrigation scene with the leg crossing & all that great stuff. You learn that Detective Curran has issues a few years prior he killed some tourists accidently he was high to boot. You knw Michael Douglas knows how to bring emotion & anger to his roles it reminds me of when I get mad. He has to up with this Pschologist Dr Beth Garner I guess they had some sort of realationship. He goes to a bar which he said he quit drinking & he has to put up with some BS from Lieutenant Marty Nielson he snaps on him in the same way I would. Then you have a wtf scene when he's having s  3  x with Dr Garner it was just unusal for me & could've been left out it did nothing. Then The Cops find out about Catherine's troubled past about the death of her parents, a college roomate & she had a boyfriend that was a boxer who died in the ring. Detective Curran follows her to figure out what she is about. He finds out that she likes to befriend killers 1 in particular Hazel Dobkins who killed her family. He runs into Catherine she starts saying things about him that should be secert. The only 1 who should have those files is Dr Garner is the only 1 that has access to thsoe files he confronts her over it she tells him that Lieutenatn Nielsen asked for them cause he was going to discharge him if  couldn't evaluate Curran. So Curran goes straight for Nielson's office & grabs him by the shirt collor he thinks that Nileson sold Catherine Tramell his file. Curran is suspended. The next morning he gets a call that Lieutenant Nielson has been killed. So Curran becomes a suspect cause of what happend the day before. He is interrigated & he says some of the same things that Catherine said during her interrigation & he started smoking again in fact earlier Catherine said he will start doing all of that again. She's writing a book about a Cop that falls for the wrong Woman & he's klled by her.He starts an affair with Catherine but he knows that she killed Johnny Boz. Roxy doesn't like it cause she & Catherine are lovers. Later on he meets up with Gus who is drunk & it's a funny scene. Anyway you have Roxy try to run  Detective Curran over. Resulting in a car chase she crash's in an area where road construction is going on her car goes off the road falls several feet where she dies. Then they find out when Roxy was 16 she had killed her brothers. He checks on Catherine where they start talking & she tells him about a girl who was obsessed with her in College named Lisa Holberman. Curran looks into & he finds out that Lisa Holberman is Beth Garner.He confornts her she tells him that it was Catherine that was obssed with her. You also have a 1 second cameo by Bradford English.Curran goes through some files & finds out that Beth's husband was killed the same way that LT Nielson was. Currna vists Catherine where he finds out her book is complete she ends therealtionship. Gus finds out about an old roomate of Catherine's they have arranged to meet at a hotel. Curran see's somebody on the 4th floor & it plays out just like in Catherine's book Gus is killed. Beth is there & he suspects her she has her hand in her pocket he shoots her before she dies she tells Curran that she loves him. He checks the pocket only to find her keys. The Cops find a blonde wig & a departmet jacket they found several of Catherine Tamell's novel's in her apartment all signs point to Dr Garner. Then you get the ending & it's like whatever. Still I think for what it did it was pretty good. I think Joe Esztherhas is a capable writer at times I don't think he's awful. You want to see badly written dialouge see what Eric Heisserer or Rob Zombie writes. Payl Verhoven did a decent job here. If I want Verohven at his best though I'll see Robocop, Total Recall or Starship Troopers. Michael Douglas did a good job. Sharon Stone did her job well.It was to be evil, seductive & hot. It's not like she was awful like Lindsey Lohan. They went with a relitive unkown cause Douglas wanted Kim Basinger Verovhen wanted Demi Moore Meg Ryan's name was thrown around too.  George Dzunaza was ok. Daniel von Borgen was there he didn't have much to do but he was decent.It's sad what happend to him though.  Leilani Sarell was ok. Dorthy Malone was ok.I know that there is a Basic Instinct 2 no I haven't seen it I have heard really bad thing about it if anybody wants me to review it leave a commit cause I can get it cheap at a Dollar Store. So I'll have an 02 in film coming up.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|the game is pretty awesome I like it better than alchemy, but the force close is really annoying. so uninstall.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I recently subscribed to Netflix. What a fantastic surprise to find the first two seasons along with the shorter third season at the tip of my remote. I thought I was a syfy pro after X-files over the years. Wrong. Interesting how much I have missed. I'll never get enough of Captain Jack Harkness. There is a bit of a continued storyline, though each episode tries to focus on one of the Torchwood family. Love the actors. Love the series. Now I'm collecting the books I discovered. Do yourself a favor and tune into several episodes when you have time.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Won't even install on my Galaxy S II Skyrocket? Never had this problem before. Oh well, poor review it is.
B0071QIN00|5.0|OMG! This is the best motorcycle  game I've ever played in my life!!! Once you start playing, you can't put it down! Totally epic!!!!!!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|They fixed the force closed and now the game works like a charm...it is really interesting and there are hints to help if you are stuck.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|who can tell me if I can go on the web with this and play downloaded games and to be more specific minecraft
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Gives you a challenge.  Like the reward even if you fail. Would like more description on what the game is before u get it. Cool game.
B005JABN8Y|5.0|This is a great product for fans of the One Piece Series.  The instructions are in Japanese but the pictures that go along with it are easy enough to follow.  The only trouble I had with assembling it was applying the decals to the sail and flags.  It was fun to put together and took about 10 hours from start to finish so the fun lasted a while.  The finished boat looks very nice and currently sits a top my shelf where I have my collection of the manga and anime.  The miniatures (the characters and smaller ships) are pretty small and come un-painted so, I haven't tried painting them yet.  I assume that I will have difficulty painting them because I haven't painted many figures.  In terms of durability, I did not break anything while putting it together so I don't think anyone else will have a problem putting it together safely.  I don't think it could survive me stepping on it though or being thrown across the room.  But, if it falls from its place on my shelf, I think it will be fine.  Once again, I think this is a great product for a fan of the series.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Of course I loved this movie! The love story is intense and the story was well interpreted from the book. My only gripe, I have to wait until later this year to see the final installment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think that it is a good idea to be able to grab your kindle and read the Bible.  Who knows you just might be having a bad day, and reading a verse or two may make all the difference in how the rest of your day goes.  So read your Bible daily.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Great app! Only have one reccomendation, pls add bi-weekly to the &quot;repeats every&quot; field. Besides that everything else is good.
0553381695|3.0|I LOVE Game of Thrones and plan on watching the whole series, but the second book is just too tedious and bogged down with characters. I quit around page 150 after reading a paragraph that contained no less than 5 name drops of characters I either couldn't remember or didn't know yet. GRRM is such a great storyteller. Just wish I could read him without using a flow chart.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set was delivered quickly and in excellent condition.<br />I have read the first book and it was great.  Lived up to the hype.  I look forward to reading the other two books.  Great service and great quality!
B0002B15XI|5.0|This DVD was great and of course delivered in perfect condition through Amazon.  Those of us who had classmates that were involved in the Veitnam War, can relate to this, even though this was about the Korean War.  It looks the same.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|This app is pretty cool if you're a business person and need stuff on the go, but if you're just a casual user for kindle fire then there's really no need for this app, as I soon found out after download. Silly me, yeah.  The Big thing is that if your computer is shut down, you cant access your desktop from your kindle...duh but I didn't know! what good is it if the stupid computer is shut down and I cant access my desktop.<br /><br />How to sync it to your kindle. This was the biggest pain in my neck. You must download the program on your Pc and not \\"run\\" it. -once downloaded, enter security code. -then sign on to your email account on your kindle, this should be done way beforehand, however. -once signed on to email, your computer desktop will \\"magically\\"appear and voila, you have full access to your pc as if its your remote control!<br /><br />This app is quite slow though on your kindle. I asked myself why on earth I downloaded in the first place! Long review! Sorry!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Games used to work great on my devices with GB and I enjoyed playing it even though features such as &quot;endless&quot; were missing.  Now all my devices have ICS on them and this game doesn't load past the first level.  Sad that most developers recognize that ICS is out there and update accordingly but Popcap hasn't updated ANY of their titles to work with it. I doubt I'll be buying anymore of their games in the future.  there are better games out there that deserve my money more.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|This movie is awesome!! It's funny, it's emotional, it's thought provoking, it's just plain great! A must see for EVERYONE!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This was a perfect and satisfying completion to \\"Something Borrowed\\".  I loved the cast of characters; felt they were well thought-out and appealing.  I especially liked Darcey's evolution and Ethan's sensitivity.  A perfect couple in the end, and a fun novel to read.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I play this game aaaall the time. its addicting and a great time waster. Could be more challenging but I still give it 4 stars
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This is one of my favorite games and I play it regular on my itouch. But this one force closes on Android eveytime I combine two elements. Fix for 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its an alright way to pass time. its a little repetitive to earn the next tier but there are games with high points to time ratio
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I wasn't really sure about this one. X&Y is one of my favorite CDs of all time but I was disappointed with Viva La Vida. It wasn't that it was bad, just a rough let down from X&Y (in my opinion). When I heard Every Tear Drop is a Waterfall, I was sure this album wasn't going to be too good either. But curiosity got the better of me and I picked this one up and I'm glad I did as it is great, even ETiaWaterfall (once I listen to it with headphones [as opposed to store speakers]). So if you like Coldplay, definitely get this one. :)
B004T2QZL8|2.0|this was an enjoyable game, but after around 10-15minutes of playing it the game began force closing every time i would merge two things. it seemed like a good game, but it has bugs that require attention.
0399246665|5.0|I sent this to my grandson's 1st birthday and he is so much enjoying the books. thank you very much for the order
B0054JZC6E|5.0|absolutely love this app! My husband and I take turns playing all the time. I also like how you have to work to unlock other awesome games. .........I give it........***** stars. ;)
B006ON41FC|5.0|I really like this game I would give it a 6 star if I could. I hope they come out with a new one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really fun. it has a lot if games for free you just use the points you earn from the games to unlock others. it runs great on kindle
B002L4QP0M|4.0|Archer is a classic novelist. I'm sure some will balk at that but, for me, it's true. I've read about 6 of his works now and, each time, I'm sucked in before the end of chapter one. I thoroughly enjoy his sagas spanning the life of a particular subject or subjects and, after reading \\"Not a penny more, not a penny less\\" I was introduced to Archer's style when it came to a plot spanning a shorter period in time.<br /><br />I picked up A matter of Honor and found  myself drawn in early in the book. Archer's writing style is very easy to follow and he never leaves you wondering where you are in the story. You always know who \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" is and where they are in space and time. I particularly enjoy the snippets of information Archer uses to color in the text. This novel involves a painting termed an \\"icon\\" that the Russians have had hanging in the Winter Palace. Unfortunately, that one is a fake and the real one was left to Capt. Adam Scott by his father who was a security guard to Air Marshal Guerring. The real one also holds a secret that the Russians and  Americans are VERY keen to become owners of.<br /><br />Capt. Scott is drawn into a cat and mouse game across Europe as he tries to get back to England with his possession.<br /><br />Along the way, Archer tells us a wonderful story full of intrigue, betrayal and twists and turns. It's great stuff and firmly cements Archer as one of my favorite authors.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This is the first app on the list of TOP FREE APPS in the Amazon app store when I access it from my Kindle Fire, yet it is NOT FREE! It's clearly labeled that it costs $0.99. I am SO disappointed; I really wanted to try out a different weather app.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|doesn't force close like the other reviews, problem with this app is that it is his awful boring.  combine this element with that one and then combine it with that one over and over.  it's like adding one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one ad nauseum.  lame
B007H7XJD4|4.0|Not so bad at all.  It was an entertaining film.  I enjoyed the story, I didn't have to adjust my brightness at all and the acting was fine.  Those were the main complaints that made me hesitate.  You'll have to watch and judge for yourself.  It seems to be a love-hate kind of flick for most.  Enjoy!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this game has really hyped and to look so good but work so poorly is very sad. force closes every time after abou 50 combinations...uninstall...do NOT download
B005VTS4EY|5.0|When I downloaded this game I figured it would be like most other mobile games. Fun for about ten minutes and not much else. surprisingly Red Wrecker made it onto one of my he screens and I play it for a few min every day as I have a little free time. For a small mobile game that's pretty good!
B002R5QPRI|5.0|stated when it was being mailed out and when it was mailed i got email just great they kept me as the customer notified what the status was of the timing i could expect shipment and it was there to the day love them!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun little app to pass the time between life's big moments. The price for this app is also well worth it. The only con is the frequent ad pop ups.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I love the Doodle ____ series... however for some reason every time I make a new Congo that fails ... it crashes. this needs to be resolved please
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Ive played this before on computer and its a really fun game so I was really estatic when it was the faotd but it is terrible on kindle fire. It force closes all the time so 1 star until seriously updated.
B004UXUX7S|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Matt King (George Clooney) is a Honolulu lawyer, and the sole trustee of a family trust. He is about to sell off 25,000 pristine acres on the Island of Kauai.<br />He does have to get the approval of his numerous cousins who, for the most part, have already spent their share of the profits in their minds.<br />His wife, Elizabeth is a bit of a daredevil and given to drink, takes to waterskiing behind a fast boat on choppy seas. There is an accident which leaves Elizabeth comatose.<br />Matt meets with the doctor only to find that she is not going to recover and that her wishes are to pull the plug.<br />Matt, who has always put business first, is forced to become a full-time father to the couple's two daughters, Scottie (10) and Alex (17). The kids have little respect for him, and yet he knows he must tell them \\"Mommy is not coming back.\\" The kids have been under the impression that their mother would recover.<br />He tells the oldest, Alex first. Alex has convinced herself that she hates Elizabeth and doesn't care. When pushed for her reasoning -- she tells Matt that Elizabeth was having an affair at the time of the accident.<br />Clueless, Matt must decide whether to find out with who and if he should confront or not. He also must go and tell his wife's parents that Elizabeth is not going to recover. Her mother has Alzheimers and her dad (Fred Ward) never thought Matt was good enough for his daughter.<br />The Descendants is a great film, filled with drama, humor and teaches family comes first in the long run.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|just when it was getting good BAM! It started force closing. hopefully they can fix this soon. it would be such a disappointment if they don't.
B007IQX1G4|4.0|Charlize Theron gives a warts and all performance as history's greatest monster, a narcissist named Mavis.  Diablo Cody's script is well-written and sharply observant.  Jason Reitman gets good performances from everyone and knows where to set the camera.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Edit: Update fixed it, great game!!<br /><br />Great game until you get about 20-30 minutes in, then it force closes every time you try combining elements. Clear data resolves, but you've lost your progress at that point and eventually it'll do the same thing. I hope the dev fixes it quickly because the rating is going down the toilet, much like my breakfast.....
B00632HWOG|2.0|will not refresh and frequently freezes up when loading... worked ok for a while now this nonsense... will not use on my fire again. works great on my android. phone.
B007CGLRWA|4.0|To begin:  the first third of the movie is out of synch which almost had me turn it off and ask for my money back.  But I stuck with it, although it should be fixed, and am I ever glad I did.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, and also a heartbreaking film.  Adrian Brody has the most soulful eyes and is superb in this film.<br /><br />The story is not very new, but it's approach is different.<br /><br />I felt a lot of empathy for each character.<br /><br />It is not for the faint of heart, for it has quite a few very difficult situations presented.<br /><br />But it's not exploitative at all.<br /><br />Rather it is tender.  Yes, tender.  And you feel for these people as if they were you and yours.
B006G2124E|5.0|Great story, what movies should be.  Brave and honest adaptation of life after African Americans were treated \\"equally\\".  Great rental or purchase.
B002GHHHKQ|4.0|I am not a Jody Foster fan but I really enjoyed this movie because of the science side of the story.  They took a lot of pains to get the science fairly accurate and that made it easier for me to into the story.  They even showed a bluish cast of the surroundings on the alien planet that would result from not having an atmosphere to screen out the blue part of the light spectrum.  Having Carl Sagan write the book was obviously a benefit in the making of the movie.  It must have provided a motive to make it as scientifically accurate as possible.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|This movie was boring and slow and then derailed into a horrible graphic bloody movie.  Really just did not enjoy it at all.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|its a fun game...when it works. I keep getting the force close bug and then it becomes unplayable because every time I try to combine it closes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a very stable app. i have not had any issues on my fire. i really like the interface.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy controls. Entertaining. Love it. Never freezes. I love the undo options because it even undoes the deal. Wish it kept stats.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a great fun game. I don't understand why so many people have the force close issue, it works perfectly fine for me.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Seemed rather fun right up to 45 elements created. Can't do anything else without the game crashing. I have an Epic Touch 4g. Unplayable games get an automatic 1 star.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|...I would surely keep the game. I made 10 groups and about 36 elements and couldn't get any further.  Would love to check out the other levels to give it a decent rating. I'm using the Droid RAZR.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Constant force close after next match attempt. Worked for an hour then died. Restart didn't help. Fun until it died.
0757302661|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to purchase this book but did so because of the recommendations I read here and boy am I glad I did! This book is amazing and the knowledge I'm gaining from reading it isn't something I could get anywhere else. I'm not to page 100 yet as I'm taking my time working my way through everything but I'm very impressed with the breathing techniques I've learned and have been able to use them in my day to day life to keep calm and relaxed. I'm pregnant with my first child and planning a home water birth, this book as taken the fear out of childbirth and I'm, dare I say, looking forward to it! I'll buy this book for anyone and everyone I know who's expecting, it's awesome!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|interesting premise... but once it starts crashing all the time, the fun is over.  hopefully they figure out the problem.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is a lot of fun...although it could be a little more fingersensitive..i also liked the.interesting.games that involves spaceships
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have had this app for several months and play it at least once a day. I like how it can be set up for right or left hand play
B004T2QZL8|2.0|the game was great til I got to about 20+ combos and it forced closed so I deleted it then re-installed it and it still didn't work...but good job anyway..try to fix the force close problem, please :)
0439023483|5.0|I first picked it up, afraid because I knew it involved killing. 10 pages in, I was satisfied. 40 pages in, I was anticipating. By 60 or so pages, I had completely lost reality. It is so easy to delve into the Hunger Games, the action, fire, love, death, and full on fight to get home and to survive. You somehow know that she will survive in the back of your head (because there are seequels), but reading you find yourself scared, sad and lonely, feeling exactly as she was. This book literally made me sob, laugh, and grit my teeth in anger.<br /><br />I LOVE YOU SUZANNE COLLINS!<br />CANNOT WAIT FOR THE MOVIES!!!!!<br />HUNGER GAMES IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE WHOLE WORLD!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|love the game its a nice way to pass time. whish it didnt take so long for certain items to be ready though add me please parisb05
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Was good until you constantly get force close at 36 elements.. Needs an update to fix, I would never pay for an app that you can't do anything with.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|If you ever played cafe world on facebook then you will like this game. Its very similar! Fake cooking at its best lol
1932735410|2.0|Let me start by saying that I passed the PMP exam a few days ago and studied for about 4 weeks.  This was the first book I bought, and thankfully not the only book.  As I say in the title, the book is confusing and intentionally abstract.  Let me start with the first part of that statement.  The first real exercise Rita puts you through is arranging what I thought were the \\"Processes\\" by \\"Process Group.\\"  Well, if you were to completely memorize this and head to the test, you'd get a bunch of questions wrong.  The book drops \\"non-processes\\" in to the listing like \\"Quality Audits\\" and \\"Stakeholder Management Strategy.\\"  Those are \\"tools and techniques\\" and \\"outputs\\" respectively.  There are others, but these two stand out because during my practice exams, I got questions wrong because of this.  Throughout the book, Rita doesn't really follow the PMBOK outline, but rather takes her own approach to describing project management (which is confusing when just trying to prep for the exam).<br /><br />Second, her question and answer section seem to be intentionally abstract and misleading.  Many of her \\"trick\\" questions don't make sense and can lead to more confusion rather than leading to a better understanding of the material.  I personally think she's dropped these \\"trick\\" questions in to give someone less confidence and use that lack of confidence to direct the student to more study materials available for purchase on their site.<br /><br />I gave her book a solid chance (read around 180 pages) before I gave up and focused on Andy Crowe's exam prep kit.  I'd imagine that Rita's book may be good for those individuals with no project management experience because it does provide a good foundation for the understanding of project management.  If you're just looking to pass the test, pass on this book.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Great app. I always have my Kindle around so this is a great reminder for not only recurring bills but for other expenses such as field trips and sporting events.

B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Really cool design but it was demolishing my battery life and doesn't have a widget. Uninstalled for now but would gladly try again if the previously mentioned issues were addressed.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|This was a pretty good game, I must say. The reason why I say &quot;was&quot; is due to getting a pop up message that I didn't own the game and when I click to redownload I had to pay $1.99.. I removed it so that's why the low score.. Thanks
B004T2QZL8|4.0|this will be similar to many other reviews...<br />I don't dislike the game itself but it had some major problems. I enjoyed alchemy so figured I'd try this one when it was a free app of the day. I liked it, at first, although one thing that bothered me was that combos I had already gotten kept coming up again. I wish there were a way to turn those off. but I kept playing...got 32 elements...and it force closed. and continued to force close with every subsequent combo attempt.<br />so...guess I'm done with this game...<br /><br />UPDATE: they appear to have fixed the force-close issue. i really enjoy the game. controls are a little wonky but completely manageable. i look forward to playing it more!
B0025KVLTC|5.0|My husband always loved the original album - but no longer owned it. This remastered version has great clarity - the songs sound better than ever
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Jumped straight into this game and made it through about 35 elements and 12 groups but it force closes permanently now. Loads of fun otherwise.
B002WTC9EW|5.0|I am a huge fan of Marian Keyes and Rachel's holiday is one of her best. Funny, sad, exciting and real, you feel better for having read it. MK draws you in, you become investedin these people and love them quirks and all.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I enjoyed playing the game for the first 20 minutes or so.  After that, every combination I tried would force the app to close.  I would love to see this bug fixed and an update come out soon.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  King does an amazing job of painting a picture of the past.  You really get a feel for what it might have been like to live then/there (I am speculating, since I was not born yet in the 60's).  I like his take on the concept of time travel and the consequences of ones' actions.  The only thing I did not personally enjoy, was the alternate future (but this is personal opinion).  A great bittersweet read!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|if you liked the other story games like farm story,fashion story or bakery story you're going to love this. you are running your own restaurant and if you have any friends playing that to they can be your neighbor.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|app is very small considering, well worth the download for the price, beats out mycast all day. I would recommend to get it.
B005HSL626|4.0|if you like to slice or dice fruit then get this app. its worth you're time if you're really bored then this will make time fly. its fun and gives you're hand a little workout.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Rented this movie this past weekend and was very impressed how it gave concrete insight and a clear historical account concerning the origin of the old but epic movie \\"Planet of the Apes\\". I would recommend someone new to the saga to see \\"The Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" before the older one. Truly enjoyed and found it to be a great movie with heart!<br /><br />NOTE: See the one listed below AFTER seeing the \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\":<br />Planet of the Apes (2001)<br />PG_13 119 min  -  Action   Adventure   Sci-Fi  -  27 July 2001 (USA)

B0050DIWFC|5.0|THIS IS A VERY INTENSE STORY, WITH MANY TURNS AND TWISTS, SOME OF WHICH THE READER WILL NOT SEE COMING OR BE PREPARED FOR
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I don't know what else to say beyond the title of my review.  I enjoyed the first, thought the second was adequate, but wanting.  This book, however, is atrocious.<br /><br />There are so many points in this book, during the \\"action\\" sequences, where all I could think about was the author's writing process.  I'm not joking or making this up.  This book sounds like the author just sat a 6 year old next to her, stuffed him with sugar and chocolate, and then just kept asking him \\"and then what happened?\\" over and over.<br /><br />Yeah, you can imagine how that would turn out:  \\"Then they were running, and then they fell because the sidewalk was a trap! then the alligator face people came in the sewer.  then the floor opened up and it was spikes.  and the spikes had poison! then they jumped over the spikes.  but then the bees came.  but the bees were robots! then the soldiers saw the robot bees and they stung them.  and then, and then...\\"  etc.etc.  That is exactly how events unfold in this book.<br /><br />Maybe I can get a sugar-high 6 year old and keep a voice transcription program running and turn that into a best-seller.<br /><br />Absurd.
B006YMLE7G|5.0|Just watch it, do it. what are you doing still reading my review go watch it now. best thing ever
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It is a lot of fun, but the fun is taken away after you get so many groups. Then it CRASHES, so don't download until the game is fixed. I am just glad it was free and I didn't loose any money._
B0052GACNM|5.0|This CD was so much fun...hearing new or young artists singing old standards of my day was really interesting.  Lady Gaga was particularly entertaining, as was that jazz singer who just passed away--Amy something. The orchestrations are swinging, too.
B007BDK3SS|1.0|Trial Xtreme 1 is wonderful, work so well, 2 is a big disapointment.  Tilt control is totally broken on my galaxy nexus, without it I did not play beyond the first ride.
0762777931|5.0|Kris Carr has carefully combed through a lot of research to produce this book.  There is a ton of information but it is organized in such a way that it is not overwhelming to get through.  Bonus points for a great layout and graphic design.  This would be a great gift for every unhealthy eater you know!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|this came pre installed on my Asus eeepad tf101!!!!!!!!!! this is the best app ever!!!!!! PS if you own a tf101 go to my cloud then click on remote desktop and that is splashtop hd
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I'd played an alchemy clone on another platform in the past.  This version is much better.  The graphics and animations are much better than the other I'd played.  The only thing dragging it down is the force close.  It worked beautifully until I got to about 50 combinations and 12 groups.  Now everytime I make a combination that doesn't work, it forces close.  I also can't figure out how to play the other episodes.  Everytime I press \\"Save the Princess,\\" \\"Run, Santa, Run,\\" or \\"Sins vs. Virtues\\" it tells me I have to complete a previous episode.  I can't figure out for the life of me what these episodes are or how to even access them.<br /><br />If the force close issue was resolved and there was a little more explanation about the episodes available, then I'd give this app a solid 4 stars.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I like the idea of using this to access my at home or at school laptop...but how? I have installed this on each computer and my Fire. It will connect when at each respective place, but not say from home to school. I am obviously doing something wrong. I'm not too technical, so if someone out there can shed some light on this, I would appreciate it. I have the necessary gmail account, as well. Thanks.<br /><br />AmyC
1407109081|5.0|\\"...Stephen King's quote on the cover of the edition I have pretty much sums up my own thoughts about this book - I absolutely hated when I did have to put the book away for boarding and migrating between gates and terminals. The more I read, the more I needed to know what was about to happen next, and I was never disappointed. With books that end up with as much hype as The Hunger Games has, it's always a concern of mine that it won't live up to the praise, but Collins absolutely delivers with this one. I'm really bummed out that the other two books are sold out in the edition I need to match the one I have of this, because I don't want to wait to get more of the story. I love the unsettling world Collins has created in Panem, and the characters who inhabit it...\\"<br /><br />For complete review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:<br /><br />herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com
B004T2QZL8|2.0|good until the oft reported force close issue. could prolly benefit from error reporting, especially since it already has network sockets.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|loved this game! I want more!!!! great story, not boring, clever puzzles. good design and game play. can play and progress at your own pace

B006SMLAMQ|3.0|very nice and full of options but i don't see how to add it as a widget to my home screen.  there is a widget setting but how to add to home screen?  it does not seem intuitive.  how about automatic location lookup?
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it lives up to my expectations. this is by far better than any store bought alarm clock, and the best out of about five others I've tried by far. you can customize snooze, and pick from many other settings. GET IT!!! the adds are at the bottom of the screen, and aren't in the way! this is fine, and it isn't necessary to pay unless you have a Phobia of adds.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie although many people do not understand why....I really did not \\"get it\\" until the end so that helped.  UNFORTUNATELY, my dog age the CD and package that was left OUTSIDE my door so I will order another one at some time.  Thankfully, I had seen it previously.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good gameplay and the dealing seemes to be completely random. The ads only appear when you start a new game but are otherwise unobtrusive. The auto complete is useful and so far no major problems.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I loved playing this game online and was happy when it came out for the mobile devices.  The game has good graphics.  the only problem I have is trying to figure out all combinations.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|its a great game besides the force close, i still play it but i hope the game developers update to fix the problem.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I played it and it did close but after undated its fine really fun good for faotd I needed more words so I put this
B003WQT2YY|5.0|Great movie, a bit on the dark side, but very interesting.  Watched it 20 years ago, and enjoyed it more this time.
B00006RU5B|4.0|These guys from Rage Against The Machine do, at least, prove that they are capable of making some good music when they aren't being pulled down by a pretend rap singer. However, they don't bring out the best in Soundgarden's vocalist. Still, there is enough good work here to merit Four Stars.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Second greatest show on the air today.  Almost as awesome as Dexter.  I only wish the seasons were longer and we didn't have to wait week to week.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Pro: It's free, isn't it?<br />Con: Too many adds<br />Pro: Great for anyone<br />Con: The adds pop up in the middle of your game!<br />Con: The adds are too long<br /><br />So, great game, but money hungry perks cannot give up the adds. So......
B0061S073A|3.0|This app solved a lot of the parental control concerns we had with the Fire.  However, I would like some way to make a folder, or to be able to select books/music to make available in the Kids Place Home Screen/Apps.  The ability for my son to switch books, or play a bit of music without coming to me to modify it would be exceptionally useful and push this up to 5 stars I think.<br /><br />It restarts on reboot, so I dont need to worry about him going \\"around\\" the system. I can choose age appropriate games and disallow internet unless he's being monitored. Which means I dont need to worry about him going into his room and reading a book, or playing a video game. I know what he has access to which eases my peace of mind.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is an example of an epic winner! So much fun in this game. Are there adds? Yes, but they are contained to a minimum and are at the very bottom! Sometimes I forget they're there! You can play against a computer or a friend.  What's not to like?
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I am enjoying the game but now all I get is constant force close messages. So glad I got this as a free app of the day and didn't pay to play for an hour before force close ruined it. Other than the force close issue it's fun but still getting a negative from me based on it's running issues.
0812992792|3.0|NO SPOILERS WITHIN!<br /><br />Many years ago I was reading a Florida newspaper and came across a Letter to the Editor that expressed the writer's awakened wonderment after her watching the movie \\"Chicken Run.\\"  She expressed in her letter how she would never again eat chicken \\"now that I know that they have deep feelings and think just like us.\\"<br /><br />I bring this to the forefront here because I have just read \\"The Orphan Master's Son,\\" a novel in which the characters behave like, well, THAT lady.  Both consist of delusional behaviors, and in fact if I were to have to say which instance was more preposterous I would not hesitate a moment to pick this novel, given the widespread paranoia and fear that dictator Kim Jong Il here engenders.  One is expected to believe that the \\"Dear Leader\\" is capable of anything, and these fantasies drive this novel, page by page.<br /><br />I found this novel hard to love, even given the fact that I fully bought into the madness of which this egomaniacal tyrant was very much guilty.  When it comes to Kim Jong Il, I am sure that the sky was the limit.  One hears of the abject poverty enforced upon his people so that he might indulge his every fantasy--much like an evil, oppressive Michael Jackson unchecked by any constraints.<br /><br />But there were problems I found while I was reading this novel, and these problems greatly interfered with my reading experience.  For one thing, \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" switches point-of-view so quickly that it is difficult to follow at times, moving from the third person account of the titular \\"son,\\" to the apparent third person account of one of Kim Jong Il's mysterious henchmen (Commander Ga), to the periodic ramblings of propaganda being piped over the ever-present urban loudspeakers, to the first person account of an interrogator of \\"political\\" prisoners.<br /><br />I understand the artistry of it: author Adam Johnson is a skilled writer, and there are several quite sensitive passages, especially when our protagonist longs for the woman he cannot have: Sun Moon, the actress discovered by the dictator who has become North Korea's national treasure and, not coincidentally, the wife of Kim's archrival.<br /><br />My problem with this book lies in its logical presentation--and before the book's five-star critics attack, let me say that I am aware that there is some inherently acceptable lack of logic and cohesion when it comes to this subject matter.  I get that.  But I had problems, for instance, when the protagonist's very role as \\"the orphan master's son\\" is over by page nine.  The development of his tunneling skills, so often referred to throughout the book, is concluded for the most part by page fourteen (though it does serendipitously reappear later).  On the other hand. the ending is telegraphed too EARLY; I figured it out before the story was even half over--I think most people will--and there was a real let-down of dramatic tension because of that.<br /><br />Granted, there must be some leeway in a world where sanity is constantly strained and those who seem rooted in madness seem to prosper--but I almost put the book into a shredder when I read of the protagonist's semi-magical transformation between the two main portions of the book.  This \\"metamorphosis\\" stretched even the most forgiving notions of gullibility.<br /><br />And it is not merely that the story strains credulity--which does seem almost proper in such a country as North Korea, where lies become truth when they serve their Dear Leader.  But this novel seems to work so hard at it that at times it is hard to follow.  Read some of the other three-, two-, and one-star reviews and you will see these points echoed.  Like them, there were times I almost tossed the book aside, as I found much of this difficult to believe.  Like them, I wanted dearly to like this book, as I thought it covers an important topic.  Having heard of this book I wanted to be another admirer of Johnson's art.  ButI just could not fully endorse how much this book strains my sense of belief, and in doing so, I felt, it actually makes this horrible dictator a little more like a figure of pure fiction, which in turn lets him OFF the hook to some extent.  This is a grievous fault, and it bothered me even more than feeling I just didn't \\"get it.\\"<br /><br />I'm certain that those who absolutely loved this book will argue that I'm incorrect, that the novelist is an artist and his writing is entirely proper to the context of the novel: that to live in North Korea under Kim's rule would be to live in a world that echoes the great dystopian world of \\"1984,\\" where every truth is a lie, where words are twisted until they suit the despotic madman who rules their society.<br /><br />And they certainly have their point: here there are such places as placid-sounding Redeemability Farms and horrific Blood Collection Squads, where the national Rodong Sinmun newspaper is said to publish its entire week of \\"news\\" on Sunday, where there are Ministries of Mass Mobilization and Prison Mines and, not ironically, Public Safety; where there is such a notion of national \\"Juche,\\" meaning self-reliance, when no one can indeed rely on ANYTHING in this madman's idea of utopia; where all electricity is turned off at night, where there is no \\"heat and fuel, where the factories were frozen in rust, where able-bodied men were either in labor camps or were listless with hunger...\\"<br /><br />Yes, this world is mad; and Kim Jong Il was surely a madman.  One hopes his death and the country's present rule of his son, Kim Jong Un, will cure at least some of these ills.  If I have gained anything from reading this novel it is that I hope North Korea's present leader takes a good hard look at his country, and faces the real problems facing them.  It would be a huge step in the right direction--and something even our own politicians could stand doing.I just could not fully endorse how much this book strains my sense of belief, and in doing so, I felt, it actually makes this horrible dictator a little more like a figure of pure fiction, which in turn lets him OFF the hook to some extent.

B0076NKNLA|1.0|In summation: This is a terrible movie about an insane, famous, horrible actress drug addict and her human dog. The end, that's the movie.<br /><br />I am 25 so my perspective is fresh. I don't know Ms work personally. The most I've seen is her in playboy(I really don't know what all the fuss is about, she's not that hot) and I've never seen the movie that the film is about. Honestly if this movie portraying M is even 70% accurate M was bat poop insane. The entire time I was thinking to myself why would she... what's going on? This isn't a love story this is about a bat crap crazy crappy actress gaining a human dog for the duration of a film shoot. That's the only way to describe the 'relationship' between M and the boy. What I mean by that is you may like your dog and treat it well etc. but we all know that the dog has no choice but to obey and do as it's told. That's the way it is with the boy in the movie and M. All the crazy stuff she does he must go along with her and do as he is told he literally hasn't a choice in the matter. And one more thing I know M killed herself with drugs etc. w/e but really the way they just pump her full of crap is/was insane. The whole movie I was thinking to myself what bullocks this is insane. And the whole thing about her fame being crazy, it's almost like deep down inside as a species we've known for some time that God isn't real so we replace that vacuum with celebrities. Anyway, insane movie, insane time and unless you already know about M and that general time period I would say this movie is to messed up to watch.

0439023491|4.0|Although I enjoyed the first book, The Hunger Games, I only felt it deserving of a 3 star review.  The writing felt a bit too simple for me, a twentysomething avid reader.  Catching Fire, however, greatly surpassed my expectations.  The games itself were much more complex, as well as the relationships between the characters and their personalities.  Much more was left unsaid and I was certainly more surprised at the outcome.  Another reviewer noted that they felt itchy and unsatisfied at the end of the first book, which motivated them to read the next book; I hands down agree with that observation. Catching Fire had a much more satisfying ending. I still can't wait to get my hands on the last book, but feel a greater sense of resolve as I reflect on this quality of this book as a stand alone work!
B000JQU1VS|3.0|I had to read four Sherlock Holmes stories for school and since this book had all four,I downloaded it.I enjoyed the storie,especially The Speckled Band,but since this edition does not have a table of contents it was very hard to go to the storie I neaded.I had to go page by page to get  to the one I had to read!Also,every time a number was used alot of symbols were placed with it,making it imposible to read.So even though I enjoyed the stories,these errors distracted  and anoyed me.I hope the publishers fix them.
0525478817|3.0|I am a 20something law student and wanted to check out the buzz on this young adult fiction best seller.  I thought the writing was good enough to start and finish the entire book in one sitting, so that's certainly saying something, but still felt it was a little too ridiculous for my taste.  The injection of an unlikable fictional author into a very heartwarming tale about terminal illness and young love was just too much.  Silly, really, but I guess it's the kind of thing you'd expect from a young adult novel.  Overall, I'm glad I read The Fault in Our Stars (it even motivated my purchase for another John Green novel) even though I didn't really enjoy the overarching story line.
1594744769|4.0|This book isn't the single most astonishing novel I've read, but it was fun. The eerie photographs were interesting and incorporated into the story in a novel way. I read it fast a few month ago, and it hasn't left an indelible impression on me--I had to work a little to remember much of the storyline (I've read a lot since then), but it did leave the impression of being enjoyable, with some emotional pull to it. If I stumbled across a sequel, I would definitely read it.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|If you are looking at this album because you like \\"Somebody that I used to Know\\" then you should check out \\"Like Drawing Blood,\\" Gotye's first album.  While Making Mirrors is good, it doesn't have the same cohesiveness that Like Drawing Blood has.  There are more songs with that sound, similar to Somebody that I used to know, on Like Drawing Blood (Heart's a Mess and Coming back are my favorites).  That said if you are a fan of Gotye you'll like this album.

My 14 year old step-son came home with this book and I like to know what the kids are reading so we read this book together.

Good read and sexy!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My son has had a lot of fun with this app. I have seen a few negative reviews;however, it works well for us....
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Is this a Joke!! Only 20 mins then crashes every time! please FIX!! Good game until now!! Can't play it!
0385534639|2.0|The book has an interesting premise and I wanted to get caught up in the story.<br />But I did not.<br /><br />The characters were not developing for me, the time period and places were confusing and it was easy to put aside.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Made it to 40 combinations before it started to force-close on every single combination.  Looks like I'll go back to Alchemy until this app gets fixed.
B001RNO7D0|5.0|I've owned a lot of really nice shoes, but these are are by far the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.  I hiked 35 miles in 16.5 hours with a 50lb pack on my back (that was a long day...), and my feet felt.. like feet.  I didn't even think about my feet because they simply weren't sore or blistered at all. They had barely been worn before that, so they either broke in really fast, or they're just that comfortable even unbroken.  These shoes have excellent support, and very nice leather.  The waterproofing is very effective (though, being low-tops they're only really effective for a bit of puddle splashing on the trail), however, the leather doesn't appear to be conditioned, because it soaks up water pretty quickly.  Some oil should solve this problem quickly.<br />I don't think I'll ever buy another hiking shoe: amazing quality, very good price, and they also look good as normal \\"around town\\" shoes with a nice pair of jeans.  I can't ask for more.  I am a satisfied customer!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I don't see what's so bad about this app... It works perfectly fine on my Kindle Fire. It has beautiful pictures and never gets boring!! I especially suggest this to you science lovers out there. It's a great app and I strongly suggest it.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|If you like romance and suspence, you will love this movie. The voice of Whitney Houston is so beautiful. I could listen to it all day long.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|not the best game after a while it gets boring.  unicorns rule the world and they fart rainbow ghjgsdgcxvgdx cvbhgx,ccv
B004T2QZL8|1.0|i was really liking the game and trying to figure out level one. was going great and as soon as i made tools ot started force closing..... I am so glad i didn't pay for this or i would be pissed. if it worked it would be a cool game
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I liked the way the sleeve fit the Kindle Fire. It has a stylish color and strap where you can slide your hand for easy carrying.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|i was on elements 48 and it stopped working when ever i tried to combine 2 elements it just stop and i have to force close it<br />i like this game but &quot;force close&quot; is disturbing
B0012GMWCU|5.0|The Rolling Stones, Cream, The Doors, all have made their version of a great number composed by Willie Dixon. I don´t know if the origianal or the copy is the best, but here you have all the originals collected on one CD and that´s great.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|it works good it helps me for me and my family . know what the for cast is going to be today. and tomarro
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Simply, a brilliant and realistic depiction of a post Agenda 21 world.<br /><br />From the controlled population/production centers to the enforced \\"Rewilding\\" of the rest of the country to the thugocratic power/control structure, to the decadent elites, it follows everything the Agenda 21 is, stands for and is designed to do... with the inevitable result(s).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are great. My daughter My son ...the whole family enjoys playing. its a great for the brother who is bored waiting at dance for the sister. its great for the sister to play waiting for mom at the Dr. APPT.
B00005JKED|5.0|I watched this because Eva Mendes is in it.  I may be the only person willing to admit it, but in my opinion she is the star of this movie.  Good lord what a beautiful woman.  Anyway, yes Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawks do a great job portraying their characters, and yes the action I expect from this kind of police drama is here.  I also think the movie ends exactly like it should.  No B.S. twists or phony flip-flop ending.  Scott Glenn is very good in this, and Snoop Dogg even shows he can act in this film, too.  But Eva Mendes is why I watched this film, and why I'll watch it several more times enough to justify being glad I bought my own copy. (thanks reviewer \\"Jason\\" for the heads up).
B0054JZC6E|1.0|i wasted all my room for this game ugh i hate it i really wish i hatent bought it i can download anymore apps now
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I want my $2 bucks back. Horrible documentation. Slow support. I never got it working so I have nothing good to say at all. I will feel better when I have purged this ill software from my devices.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|This was in my opinion was very good movie.Somehow the syfy element with the western element worked off of each other better than I would have imagined.The two combined produced and enjoyable experience.
B007HLIUN4|1.0|I bought this book when I read a favourable review and thought it would be interesting to explore the reasons why some states succeed economically, while others never `take off' and others take flight but stall.  I smelt a rat when I started to find that the style of writing is repetitive and circular and when I found some straightforward factual errors.<br /><br />The authors say that the Spanish Armada was pursued (by the English) `all round the coasts of Britain'.  Well no: we stopped pursuing it off the coast of Kent, and it sailed home via the North Sea and the Atlantic because there was no other way back.  The Armada was largely destroyed by bad weather, off the West coasts of Scotland and Ireland.  Likewise, the authors say - as if there is some significance in this - that at one time England and Hungary were ruled by the same dynasty, the Angevins.  Well, it depends what you mean by `Angevin': it was a prolific house; but the Angevin dynasty in Hungary did not come to power until the fourteenth century, by which time we English call our kings `Plantagenets'.  They may have been descended from Angevins, but conventionally the Angevins ruled England in the twelfth century; and they were only remotely related to those who ruled in Hungary, Naples, Anjou and Provence.<br /><br />The detail matters.  If you can't get the facts straight, what hope is there for the grand theory?<br /><br />When you look at the `case studies', the history here is truly crude - almost like Sellars and Yeatman's `1066 and All That', but without the humour.  Take English history, which I know something about.  The authors place far too much importance on the Black Death of 1381 (feudalism did not come to an end overnight as a result of that event, catastrophic though it was).  They accept Geoffrey Elton's account of the `Tudor Revolution in Government', when this was largely discredited by medievalists, almost as soon as it was formulated.  They regard Christopher Hill's account of theso-called `English Revolution' of 1640-60 as being the last word, ignoring at least four decades of criticism. They overemphasize the importance of the Glorious Revolution and ignore how English society was between 1688 and 1832 (and beyond), notwithstanding the Industrial Revolution.  They constantly confuse `England' with `Britain'.<br /><br />If the treatment of English history is so brief and sweeping as to be a caricature, it makes me wonder about the history of other countries; and I am very suspicious of the authors' treatment of Japan, Venice and Ancient Rome in particular.  With regard to Rome, they take it as read that the Roman Empire declined before it fell; but there is a very respectable view that it simply fell, when invaded by the Barbarians; and the authors detect the seeds of decay as far back as the reign of Augustus.  What then of Gibbon's view that mankind's happiest days were passed in the age of the Antonines, in the second century A.D.?<br /><br />The problem is that the authors purport to be experts on everything and on every age, when in fact they are masters of nothing but a theory; and the theory is so broad and vague as to be almost incapable of proof or disproof.  Thus centralisation +  inclusive institutions = lasting economic success and prosperity.  I think I go along with this to some extent; but the terms are very elastic.  What degree of centralisation counts as such?  What is meant by `inclusive' or for that matter `extractive'?  They may be right about the USSR and China; but I am not sure they have explained why the former failed and why the seemingly inexorable rise of the latter may be an illusion.
0061537969|4.0|I laughed out loud, smiled a lot, and cried a little.  A quick and easy read, but so worth every word! Wise and wonderful!
1466401885|5.0|There may be SPOILERS, read with caution. But please READ THE BOOK!! I must say I was really disappointed by so many negative reviews on this book. I really hope people give this book a chance. The cover also threw me, after reading the book, the cover has nothing to do with the book at all. I was, like most people who loved this book, found myself saying, one more chapter but I just couldn't put it down. Those who compared this to Twilight, I am a lover of the Twilight Series and this book is nothing like those books at all. I found my self loving Travis from the start. What woman wouldn't want a man that loved you so passionately, that fought so hard to keep you. I really think he was a passionate man, who didn't know what love was until he met Abby. I kept reading reviews about how \\"mental or crazy\\" Travis was and how no girl should look up to him. I think some of the readers of the books that hated it, maybe lived a sheltered life? The story of Abby and Travis really represented a lot of relationships. A love that was so passionate that there was so many ups and downs, like a lot of relationships. I was 20 when I married my husband and a lot of people thought we were crazy too. Just like in the book, it was fast, strong and passionate. I think all of the different plots that were in the book, went perfectly with the story line. The vegas and the mob scenes, explained why Abby hated her father. The ending of the book, was brilliant, I didn't expect it but I wanted it to end something like how it did throughout the whole book. I think the author wrote a true to life book. I am also glad that it was the only book and there was no sequels, I am so tired of cliff hangers and having to wait to read another book to find out if they end up together or not. I am so glad also that there wasn't a \\"love triangle\\", yes, there is Parker but really Abby was always thinking of Travis, always knew it was Travis she wanted. I too, like many readers found myself relating with the characters, I saw myself in Abby, and I saw a few of my \\"bad boy\\" boyfriends in Travis, I think that is why I found myself loving the characters. I also loved how the author brought the side of America and her boyfriend Shepley, I loved reading how their characters were so much a part of the book. And Travis' family also. I just found myself, screaming at the book, wanting to cry, and laughing throughout the book. I didn't want it to end but I am glad it ended the way it did. Please Jamie McGuire don't make a second book on Travis and Abby, I like how it ended, no I LOVE the ending. Even though I miss the characters already. Please, give this book a chance. I know some people hated it but it really is a great love story. A love story that has so much passion and need. If you ever loved somebody so much that it hurt and so passionately, you will love this book. I too, am looking forward to reading more of Jamie McGuire's books.characters, I saw myself in Abby, and I saw a few of my \\"bad boy\\" boyfriends in Travis, I think that is why I found myself loving the characters.

B004T2QZL8|3.0|While Doodle God is a fun game, it is a fun game *while it works*. It consistantly Force Closes on my HTC G2, making the game impossible to play. I'm glad i got it for free.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|just like everyone has said here the game is super fun until it starts with the force close. once it happens u cant go any further sadly. ill keep it in my kindle fire with the hopes they'll come up with a fix.
B00003CXBK|5.0|one of my favorite movies. i just had to get another copy when a friend moved away after borrowing it with out returning it. a great family movie if you don't mind showing kids some killing.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire. The graphics are superb. However, it keeps stopping in the middle of a game, and you have to force close. It's unplayable.  I've played the game before and it can be a lot of fun.<br /><br />Amazon:  Please fix this!!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Was going good til...<br /><br />Sulfur + metal...it made force close...<br /><br />So it has bugs and needs fixed but a good game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun and I love playing it and so dose my dad lol................................................................................................. wow I love this game u should totally download it
1439102732|4.0|I read this for my book club and was amazed that I was the only one who liked the music that accompanied this book.  Some didn't like the singer's voice (it was only fair, truthfully), some didn't like the lyrics (I thought they were very good for most of the songs), some thought having to listen to the songs was annoying and disruptive to the reading (I had to agree on this one and won't get another book with music again).  I have never read Jodi Picoult before and my club director said this one has a positive ending when most of her books don't. Wow...I probably won't read her again in that case.  I thought it was interesting about the legal issues surrounding ownership of the embryos but it was almost as if Ms Picoult backed down at the last moment on the sad stuff in order to give a positive ending.  Also, I liked the character of Lucy....so angry and so damaged; so well written.  Her history was never completed (though we do find out who she really is) plus there were other character's stories that weren't as fully developed as I would have liked. My club thought Max was a jerk; I didn't.  I just thought he had a human response to a horrible problem. However, this book would have been 1,000 pages if they were.  Personally, I think Ms Picoult had too many story lines going and it left me wondering if there will be a sequel in order to tie it all up, though I was told she never writes sequels. Worth reading for the experience of accompanying music and the positive ending.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I love this game: it's fun, fast and entertaining, but the app sucks big time. I was only able to play it for 4 mins.  before the app force closed. If the app's major glitch gets fixed, i would surely give it the five star review the GAME deserves.
0312370849|5.0|I hated the title.  I had seen it listed on Amazon before my book club decided to read it and I thought I was in for some sloppy, sappy story.  Was I ever surprised.  Sarah is a Jewish girl, taken by the authorities during World War Two.  The French authorities!  Who knew the French supported the Nazi's in this??  I was told that the French president came out a few years ago and admitted to their complicity and I was stunned. Anyway, the book goes back and forth from her story to present day Julia Jarmond, a journalist, who finds out about her and tracks down her descendants. Well written and historically correct, this book is a slightly different point of view about the whole Holocaust thing....the German occupation of the French and their involvement in what happened.  I liked this book very much because I actually learned something from it.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I enjoyed this easy going game. I did take off a star, as the force close error after 28 elements makes the game impossible to play. Hopefully this issue will be addressed!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I'm absolutely in love with this app except for the fact that after playing it for ten minutes it force closes and now I can't play it at all. DEVELOPER: PLEASE HEAR OUR CRIES AND FIX THIS APP SO WE CAN CHANGE OUR REVIEWS AND SUPPORT YOU!
0307352145|5.0|I loved this book.  Introversion has been so misunderstood.  I have spent much of my life trying to come to terms with the fact that I am not the cultural ideal.  I have learned that there are strengths to being an introvert, but I still find it frustrating that society as a whole does not understand.  One idea that is continualy misunderstood is the difference between social skills and introversion.  This book brings light this subject and many more.  Just reading how the Extrovert Ideal is described, helped validate my own feelings on the subject.  I believe all introverts should read this book to see the value in who they are and how they function and all extroverts should read this book to help them understand the introverts they interact with and love.  I will be giving this to my best friend and mother to read.  I highly recommend this book.
B006Y5BWQG|5.0|If you love the world of musical theater, you may enjoy this smashing romp aptly titled SMASH.  With a stellar cast including Deborah Messing, Katherine McPhee and Anjelica Huston with Spielberg producing it, there's talent invested in it.<br /><br />The talent is trying to produce a Broadway Musical based on the iconic Marilyn Monroe.  However, there are the usual challenges: inconvenient romances, slimy director, cast rivalry, insufficient financial backing, script rewriting etc. It is great fun to observe the creative process and the chaos surrounding it.  Will they produce a smash hit?  You want to keep watching to see if it will come together.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|using this app on kindle fire is excellent! i have used it to take notes in classes and it works brilliantly. i can access my notes from my other computers, organize them in notebooks and tags and add web content and other attachments that make this app an excellent addition to any computer, tablet, or phone. if you ever need to make checklists, remember names or emails, or take notes this is the app for you.
0385344228|3.0|When I read the first review of this book I knew I'd read an identical story plot before.  I read three to four books a week and it didn't take any thinking at all for my brain to click back to Before and After by Rosellen Brown.  Landy seems to have taken the plot outline of that book and fleshed out the characters and included more courtroom protocals.  This is good or bad depending on whether you're reading to see how it ends or to immerse yourself in a family drama.  There is a bit more suspense as to the outcome than in Before and After but I agree with some of the previous reviewers that the father figure seems more than a little bit unrealistic.  A seasoned lawyer may well try to find alternate suspects, the other dude did it.  Also it overdid the bad gene theory.  I enjoyed the book but as I'm a retired court reporter I found myself skipping over much of the lengthy courtroom protocol explanations.
0439023513|1.0|I just finished Mockingjay and I'm actually depressed. I was so enthralled in the first two books that I finished them in less than two days each. I reccomended them to anyone who would listen...I was obsessed! This was about to go down in my book as the best trilogy ever,instead the book ruined the series for me. Can we have a redo of book 3 Collins?  Please, this needs to be made right. I realize that I sound like a lunatic but I really feel that let down by this book.  Your first two books were brilliant and for those I thank you, but if there is any way to fix this...we'd love you for it!

B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game was fun until I created nearly 40 elements.  Every pairing I try now forces the game closed. Please fix.  This would be a wonderfully entertaining game otherwise.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love all three of the workouts on this disc.  I am basically a beginner and was able to get a handle on this.  I was about 12 pounds over my recommended weight when I started it, so not majorly overweight. I have two children age 4 and 2.  Anyway, I did find that Jillian does not allow enough time to adequately warm up so I just do it on my own (i use another dvd program that's basically walking for 20 minutes).  I also do more stretching at the end than what she leads us through. Overall I love Jillian and have definitely seen results.  I haven't lost much weight (about 8 pounds after 6 weeks) BUT I have gained muscle and I am toned.  My husband notices, too. And my in-laws paid me compliments too! Thanks, Jillian!!

B004T2QZL8|1.0|Game was a joy for about the first 10 minutes.  Now absolutely every combination crashes the app (causing an unexpected stop).  You'd think that Amazon would check for things like this before releasing the app...

And cool,layout and display and all..  I kinda wanto to know aboy the other chapters or levels.. Dont really get that.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|i wish i could get back my money and time and erase the memories of this twisted tale from my mind ... look elsewhere as this is just a waste of energy!  they should rate books for sex scenes so people know what they are getting into ... disturbing bondage! no thanks!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|awesome execution of this jazzy alchemy, but once I hit 48 combos the only thing that happened was continued force closing. will reinstall when its fixed.
B004UXUX7S|3.0|Maybe it's my fault.  I was expecting a lot more.  From the Oscar nods to the well-woven movie trailer, The Descendants seemed like it would be a story that took you on a great journey of an estranged father reconnecting with his family after a tragic accident.  That seemed to happen in the first 30 minutes and then the film held one note for the next hour.  There were no real great personal discoveries, no real moments that tugged at the heart and connected you with these characters and the overarching backdrop of a family who were the Descendants of the first settlers in Hawaii and who owned all of this virgin Hawaiian land was just too predictable for me to be surprised at the end.<br /><br />It's not a bad movie, but it certainly doesn't deserve the crazy hype that it got either.  There are one or two really great lines in the film and then the rest of it is just vanilla.  It's a film about dealing with the loss of a family member taken too soon, but it's also a film about betrayal and anger...at least, it should have been.  Clooney, again, plays one note through the whole thing except for one tender moment near the end of the film.  His anger and frustration isn't consistent, his mellow temper towards his daughter's outbursts just makes his character as plain as a a white t-shirt.  Maybe that was the intent.  At the end of the film, I felt the same way about the guy and about the family as I did at the beginning of the film.  The only character development I really saw was the older daughter's surfer-dude friend.  He has some great scenes and some great moments in that film, but he is a bit character and not who the focus of the film was supposed to be about.<br /><br />Again, nothing against the film.  The acting was fine.  The script was okay.  The backdrop of Hawaii was nice...but I wanted something more.  I wanted more out of the character development and the overall story.  I wanted some real reactions and some real emotions that lasted longer than just one scene.  There is a great scene at the pool where the oldest daughter is told about her mother's condition and she submerges herself and cries underwater...but then, it doesn't phase her after that.<br /><br />Many of us have experienced the loss of people that we love and it IS a roller coaster of emotions and feelings, pain and joy, sorrow and madness...this film didn't go there and I wish it would have.  It would have been and could have been one of those films like Ordinary People or Forrest Gump.  Films that will endure because of how incredibly human they are.  I don't think The Descendants is in the same league.

1451683405|4.0|I should start off by stating that I am a big fan of Sam Harris and I even possess a signed copy of Letter to a Christian Nation.  The subject of Free Will is interesting but (spoiler alert) the subject has been largely resolved in the neuroscientific community for some time and we have now moved on.<br /><br />Fundamentally, the brain is an information processing system (like the automatic feedback loops of a computer) with outputs entirely dependent upon inputs.  Succinctly and non-scientifically stated, these inputs into the brain come from the following sources: electrical signals received from our senses that convey a notion of how the world is, electrical signals that are constantly looping in our brains that synthesize information (via mechanisms such as projection neurons), and the current biochemical and organic states of our brains (from our inherent genetic structure, stored memories, and the environment we happen find ourselves in up until this point).  From what we know, if there is something called Free Will, then there is really no place for it to exist.  The frontal lobes (which are often incorrectly thought of as the \\"decision making\\" area of the brain) are a highly evolved neuroanatomical region that has the task of receiving, manipulating, and consolidating information from many other brain areas.  Further, the frontal lobes are part of a feedback system that is constant and automatic.  The notion of free will implies that somewhere within the frontal lobes is an area that can spontaneously show highly coordinated activity without inputs from other brain regions.  In addition to our brains not working this way, our brains could not work this way because, for one thing, brains exist in and obey the same laws of a cause and effect physical universe like any other physical object.<br /><br />As stated, the notion of the absence of free will is mostly a settled topic in the neuroscientific community.  What I find infinitely more interesting at this point is the implications an absence of free well has on the notion of self.  I am a highly complex feedback control system with my behavioral outputs being entirely explained by the total sum and configuration of inputs.  And you are this way too.  If we are both undergoing these processes at the same time, then your thoughts and behaviors change me (in a fundamental neurobiological sense) as much as my own thoughts and behaviors.  With this realization, the distinction I make between you and me is largely artificial.  And even though the neurons in our brains are not directly connected to each other, they might as well be.  This is because sensory information exchanged back and forth between you and me inescapably make us both part of the same process.  So if the difference between you and me is predominately because your brain is in your head and my brain is in my head, this now appears to be a distinction without much of a difference.  And, as can be inferred from the writer's arguments in his book, you and me are not really distinguishable by me supposedly being conscious (or more conscious) of my thoughts and you of yours.  In fact, because we do not act separately from each other, distinguishing you and me at the individual/person level can actually seem sort of arbitrary.  It is possible that we distinguish each other in this manner merely because we have evolved to do so.  These implications of the notion of self, which necessarily follow from the absence of free will, I find interesting with notable societal implications.
006197806X|5.0|My Thoughts: DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVEN'T READ DELIRIUM. AND IF YOU HAVEN'T, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR????<br /><br />Uh, I'll start this review off with what I wrote on goodreads as soon as I finished.<br /><br />If you thought Delirium was great you will be blown away by Pandemonium. I wish I had the next book. OMG. I want to both cry and scream right now.....<br /><br />Why, why, why did I read this so soon? LOL<br /><br />I had a feeling it was going to end like that but to actually have it happen is going to drive me nuts now since I don't have the next book.<br /><br />WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW<br /><br />So, that was my initial thoughts when I updated my goodreads status.<br /><br />Do I still feel that way? Yes, Yes, Yes.<br /><br />We start off in the Now part of the book. For 2 pages, than we are thrown into the Than part. Confused yet?<br /><br />We are reunited with Lena. She has escaped to the Wild's without Alex. Oh, I'm sure you remember that dreadful ending in Delirium and Alex is still nowhere in sight. Lena suspects he's dead even though she doesn't want to say it out loud. She imagines he's still with her and goes out on her own.<br /><br />She ends up being on her own for a few days until a group of others come across her and take her in, nursing her back to life. Let me tell you about my favorite characters. There is Raven, who seems to be a few years younger than Lena, but has become one of the leaders of the group and takes care of everything. Than there is Blue, who is just a little girl. I really liked Blue but she reminded Lena too much of Grace. Next up is Hunter. Hunter's a sweet guy who is friendly to Lena from the start. Than there is Tack. Tack is independent, strong willed, and tough. He always has a scowl on his face. Of course, there are many more characters but these are just a few of my favorites.<br /><br />Lena survives in the wild with the group for a while. She learns to get supplies, learns to wash clothes by hand, to carry water buckets, how to cook, the whole nine yards. She does what she must to survive and stay a part of their group.<br /><br />Than we are thrust into a whole other world. The future tense. What is happening NOW. Lena is working with Raven to take down the DFA. They are the ones who want everyone to be cured. We meet Julian right away. He is the son of the person who thinks love must be cured. He is due to have his procedure soon.<br /><br />Lena and Julian end up getting captured during one of the meetings and thrown in a room together. They spend days in that room, getting to know each other slowly and awkwardly. They think they have nothing in common at first except that she has been cured (she lies) and he is to be cured soon. He wants to know what it will feel like, will all temptations be taken away? Will he feel like a different person?<br /><br />Lena and Julian end up escaping and make their journey to find Raven and Tack. In the process, Julian is taken back by his father, and set to have his procedure. Of course Lena doesn't think its right to make him have this procedure. He should have a choice, a real choice.<br /><br />Well, I don't want to give away anymore spoilers. That was already a few and I didn't want to give away any!<br /><br />Do we ever see Alex again? Let me just say this, the information we find out about Alex and Lena's mom is insane. It was crazy intense. This whole book was so great. It was full of action, fast paced, and just a wonderful story. I wish I had the third book now.<br /><br />The Than and Now back and forth chapters were a little confusing at first, but I got right into it. The bad thing is, I didn't like skipping back and forth because Oliver pulls you into one than you want to know what happens in that situation, than your thrust into the other situation. I'm sure that was her point, but I was on pins and needles the whole book. (Which is a good thing HAHA)<br /><br />I loved Delirium and I was left crying at the end. I loved Pandemonium even more, and I was left wanting to cry but at the same time, wanting to tell her how genius she is!<br /><br />For all you Alex fans out there, you won't be completely disappointed however you won't be happy either. I was totally in love with Alex but throw another guy in the mix, and I'm as confused as ever. Love Triangle anyone?<br /><br />Overall: Oh My Gosh. I absolutely loved it. Can I marry this book? This was one of my favorite books I've read of 2011!!!<br /><br />Cover: Really like it. Delirium had a cool cover, but so does this one.<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br />____________<br /><br />Review Based On Hardcover Edition<br /><br />Taken From Princess Bookiend.

0802473156|5.0|I received the book within the time slot addressed.<br />The book was in great condition when I received it.  It's a wonderful book and I have enjoyed it very much. I would buy others from the same author.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|It looks nice but with no widgets for my home screen its pointless. I don't want to have open up the app to see the weather.<br /><br />What I would like to see from the app besides normal widgets is the ability to make the backgrounds in the app live wallpapers for my phone that automatically updates with what the weather is supposed to be.
B005G26NJE|5.0|There's more soul in these four tracks than many artists can cram into an hour-long album.  Amazing stuff.  I bought it after listening to his performance on KEXP, and was in no way disappointed with his recorded work.
B006O5Y09C|4.0|Good to see Woody Allen's work again. I've been a fan for many years. The movie reminds me of some of his earlier work.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I was really having fun with this game, but now I can't play it. After creating about 20 elements, it started force closing on me. Now it force closes as soon as I try to make an element, so I can't even play it. If the FC is fixed, and I can play it further, probably will rank it higher.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Just about the time you start like this game it starts to force close.  Then once it does it will do it every time you try to combine anything.  Razr Maxx.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it lets kids watch Internet on the go and without wifi no doubt its a great app. I think it should have 6 stars
B004T2QZL8|3.0|It was really fun until it started crashing every match attempt. Now its not playable. Fix that and I would give it 5 stars.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|I'd have to watch this one again to get any sense of what was going on.  It's just a hard movie to watch, definitely the most boring movie I've ever seen of it's genre.  On the bright side at least I only rented rather than bought it.
0439023521|1.0|I have not read the book which means that I shouldn't be writing a review, but I'd just like to point out that the film adaptation of this book is entirely genius if the idea was to turn a book about a society kept passively entertained by violent/sexual imagery into violent/sexual imagery used to keep a society passively entertained. I don't think that was the intention, though.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|It was shaping up to be a fun little game till it started force closing Everytime you use it. Ill likely be uninstalling until it gets fixed. To bad ill lose my progress thus far.<br /><br />UPDATE fixed shortly after posting this I got an upd.ate that fixed it. Much better now
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app iz, bomb it gijbvv ffu xxr vg  f fgjg ghh bbf vvhj vfdx gjvx gfd ty j hhffy h gf gh.  Gv v n
B004T2QZL8|1.0|same as most of you....I enjoyed the game till the force quit started to happen. pity it was fun. maybe they can fix it
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this is a cool app...the crash sucks. and I was just really getting into it when it started acting up.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Htc thunderbolt-I was enjoying this alot and after approx 20something closes it's no longer fun. I rebooted reinstalled went to wifi I give up. I will keep the game b/c it is unique and hope for update to fix this issue many seem to have good concept but this is a must fix
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I thought this game was great. I find it better than the Alchemy. I have trouble remembering which formula goes to which game though.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Great game,  super fun, lets you see what reactions you have done,  was very nice until it started crashing, get it while its free so when its fixed you have an awesome game.
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|I hate this game. its just like the first only worse I cant belive that u had to pay for it. totally a huge rip of!!!!!!!!!'!
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|With the amount of space this app takes up I was hoping for a nice widget since my Xperia&trade; PLAY doesn't have any good ones. Other than that it displays a lot of good info in a easy to read way. Good app if you have a lot of open space, I guess.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there is a lot of games to choose from from the start.  hours of fun, even for my four year old.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a pretty good game. I wish there was a walkthrough so if you are having trouble on a level, you just tap it and bam!! you are now knowing what to do...... :)
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I am only leaving a review because I keep getting a force close error. I made it to 33 elements and it keeps crashing every time after trying to make more. I am using a rooted Nook Color with CM 7 Nightly
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Most accurate renders with the most pleasing UI.  Please integrate support for powerpoint animations and iron out some display formatting issues and this could make my tablet a replacement for my laptop!
B002HNA95E|5.0|I love Madonna music. She is eccentric in all her performances. She brings excitement to her style of her music. Her music especially this great cd CELEBRATION was one of her best cds ever recorded. She is a legacy of her female talent and will leave a mark in the music history of her own electric style. Her performance at this years Superbowl at the young age of 50 has proven she's still got it. Thanks Madonna you will always be one of my best and favorite entertaining music artist. And thanks Amazon.Com for making it possible for this great purchase and quick and excellent shipping of my product. Thanks to you I have another great cd added to my Madonna collection!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|it is a little annoying how often it is forced folded.  I do enjoy it as long as I have played it. so I hope they fix the force close soon
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire. I've had no problems with pop ups or movie trailers. I highly recommend this app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|everything you could ever need, and then some. easy to use features and great for new bible readers provides reading plans and devotionals
B004T2QZL8|1.0|My kindle keeps saying force close making this SUPER frustrating to play! Please fix so my kids can enjoy this unique game.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|... but I loved every second of reading Charles Duhigg's new book, \\"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\\". It's truly interesting, examining habits from so many different angles, from the personal to the professional, how they inhabit companies and organizations and how the effect things without people even being aware of them.<br /><br />What I thought the book would be about is an examination of people's habits, and how to change them. And while that concept was addressed throughout the book, this isn't truly a \\"how-to\\" manual that I thought the book would be. It's actually better. Duhigg illustrates the power of habits by providing so many real life/real world experiences that the book quickly becomes a page-turner as you get engrossed in the stories of people and companies like Starbucks and Target.  What was funny, as I finished the book, is that the author put more of a \\"how-to\\" section in the appendix of his book, which was extremely helpful!<br /><br />Reading this book are me think differently about my life (what's the cue for me to brush my teeth at night? Judge Judy [don't ask!]) and what I do and why I do it. You can't ask for much more than that.<br /><br />You want an entertaining, thoroughly engrossing read? Try this book today!
0811874192|3.0|This book has beautiful paper flower bouquets. But with all the wonderful pop-up books available these days, this one did not measure up to the spectacular ones of Sabuda and Reinhart.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It was fun until it force closed. Now I cannot play. It would be great if it would stop creating duplicate elements to!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I have been waiting for a DVD of this wonderful Broadway play. This taping of a live performance was excellent.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I honestly have a hard time believing anyone would enjoy this. I can't think of one character you might care about. The writing is juvenile and repetitive. I must admit, i couldn't read the whole book. After getting to 80%, i skipped to the end. In my opinion, this is a total waste of time and eye strain. I only wish i could get my money back.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. I love the audio feature,  great voice. so many versions to choose from, and its free. downloaded others and just ended deleting them, they cant compare.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Without a doubt there is a place in music history for those that were in a zone and above all the rest.  Some may come close to them, but just don't make it all the way.  Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Elvis, and of course the Beatles do make it all the way. This anthology is just great as it leaves you wanting more and more of this wonderful music.  Video and audio are excellent as the 5.1 sound just blows me away. We also know that this was not just a fad as each of the beatles went on to successful careers and continue to sell music on a regular basis.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|but don't blame this app because your fire does not have gps or accelerometers that's on you... check out Star Walk for more features.
B004I744AS|5.0|It does what it says and more. You not only get a dictionary but a fairly good translation into other languages. Also the quote of the day and the various articles of famous people in history is a bonus
B004P4KMSC|5.0|This is a nice German built model that is suitable for displaying or giving to the kids to play with. The detail is very good. Mine came in solid white not beige as pictured but I liked that better. I've bought three Bruder model for my grandson and he loves them all and they're sturdy enough to last for years.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|aa lways force closes after a few minutes o f playing making it almost impossible to play, needs. update soon
0545123275|4.0|This book was good it had its flaws though. Good thing is that the flaws didn't ruin the book.<br /><br />I loved reading from both views. It's always nice to see what is going on in both minds. That was what hooked me, you knew her and you knew him. They had strong personnalities, enough so that you didn't have to read who was talking this time. I liked how they always loved each other no matter wolf nor human. Sam always knew Grace in some way. So when they got together it may have seemed like to much to soon but actually it was just right.<br /><br />I didn't like the start of the book, one minute she is being attacked and the next she is in her kitchen. I understood what was happening after a while but I wish it didn't jump like that. The wolves secert was sacred blah blah, not exactly a whole bunch of people started knowing about it. Jack was the thriller in the book so it wasn't just a love story so of course his sister had to be thrown into everything. Did that other person have to be thrown in though? There was no real point in her needing to change, no real point for her being bitten. If it was because she didn't belong then neither does Grace.<br /><br />I'm glad for the ending, things placed themselves as they should have...now time for Linger!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how this app allows you to choose any plan and has easy access to any part of the Bible.  I personally don't read my Bible as often as I should, but this encourages me to read often.  I totally reccomend this app! :)
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This game will seem boring from the pictures but is soooo fun and addicting for adults and kids! It is the best kindle game ever...I have finished this game, deleted it, and then got a new one to start over! Its just so fun, GET IT, AND YOU WILL PLAY IT 24/7...NO LIE!!!!
B002T9H2LA|2.0|The actors are dolls. The director is a little boy. He makes them say clever and confusing things. Then he makes them kill and torture each other. He plays kitschy music in the background.<br /><br />This is every Quentin Tarantino movie ever made. And they've gotten less and less imaginative as the years have progressed.<br /><br />In Basterds he just puts swastikas on the sandbox. Take away the violence and sadism and all you have is a bunch of long-winded machine-like speeches which hold your attention only as a precursor to the violence Tarantino has conditioned you to expect, something like an 80's porno flick without the sex.<br /><br />If you enjoy the victim/victimizer paradigm, or have a deep-seated psychological need to watch simulated torture, this will be enjoyable for you.<br /><br />If you want to see a half-decent Tarantino flick, rent Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.
0307949508|5.0|Excellent new condition. I loved the movie that went with the first book in this series. Ive decided against reading the next one 'the girl who kicked the hornet's nest. Not exactly my kind of books.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I really like how it looks and plays, but like most of us the crashing is the only reason its not 5 stars.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|If you can't play the game because it keeps force close on you then I'm not going to keep it.  Just waste of memory on my phone.  Fix it or I'll delete it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a very great app. the best ever. it has wonderful audios on some versions and allows u download some versions for free so u can read offline. if u think d Bible is not fun, u need to listen to the audio Bible....NIV version recommended. you will get into it!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|The game was bad all along, but the force closes were constant. You couldn't play. I was very frustrated, and the more you redownload, the worse it gets.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|As Kelly keeps re-defining her \\"sound,\\" she stays true to what made her a winner in the first place...her anthemic voice. If that's what you love about Ms. Clarkson, then you'll be sure to enjoy the album!
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|OK, maybe not \\"useless\\" but nowhere as good as many free apps like Weatherbug. I like that it doesn't automatically reorient to my location, although I wouldn't mind the option. My biggest complaint is that there's no satellite map option. Whenever rain is expected, I use the map to get a better idea if it'll hit & when. I often commute by bike and it's nice to know if I need rain gear or if it looks like I can beat it.<br />It is nice (and pretty) with a quick view of different info, but not good enough for the file size & cost. It's OK as a free app though.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|starts off fun then the freezing starts. able to play for about a good 20-30 minutes then it started freezing then force closing over and over again. waiting for new update before I starting playing again. just glad it was free
B0054JZC6E|3.0|low budget games. some that are hard to control your player... but its enough to keep you slightly entertained when you're really bored.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I like this game a lot. It's just like Alchemy, but better. Was having fun making all sorts of stuff until I got to 44 items and it kept force closing once you try to make one thing, anything! Hopefully they fix it soon, the game itself is cool.<br /><br />Gonna try to uninstall and re install to see if I get different results. I'd give it 5 stars but it's broken... And right at the good part at that!
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|It's pretty, that's the one star. It has no gps following. It's 90+ mb for ICS,  beautiful widgets is 4 mb!! It brings nothing new to table. This isn't the iphone boys. Work to shrink your app.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I like the game but it keeps force closing now that I have played it a bit.  fix that issue and my rating and review will improve.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|It's okay, I mean there aren't very many levels, and I got the paid version. It's kind of additive!!! Fun too
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I always love playing this game when I traveling or bored. its a great app!!!! i t is totally worth the money, you should totally buy this app!!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Face it, it's a sex book, not a literary masterpiece. Just like a porno is to the movie industry, this book was to the literary industry. And just like a porno, there was a lame attempt at building a plot around all that sex. Yes, the writing was lame, the characters were annoying, and the plot was almost non-existent. Having said that, did I enjoy it...sure. Was it a guilty pleasure...sure. As long as you don't try to take it too seriously and take it for what it is, you might enjoy this book.  A little piece of advice, though - don't attempt to read this book on a crowded bus during your morning commute!
B001EL6EHC|5.0|It was alot more than I expected. I was really stoked when I recived it. I came with a bunch of postcard sized movie posters, a book,and a passport holder and luggage tag.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|its a very good game but after about 70 combination and 12 groups they just force close all the time. please resolve the issue.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I love this game but I would love it even more if it didn't close every time I play plzzz fix those Kindle Fire
B004T2QZL8|2.0|...force close. Just like many others here, I'm getting constant crashes about 10 minutes into the game. Up until that point, it is a fun little time waster, but the crashes make it a big money waster (glad I got it for free). If it gets fixed, it's easily a 3 to 4 star game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is quite amazing. The more I use it the more I love it. The Bible is something I've always wanted to get to know more an now I can.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|While this is a great app for remotely managing your desktop/laptop, it does have one very significant issue with Windows XP: no sound unless your sound device is capable of hardware mixing (not terribly common outside of &quot;hardcore gaming&quot; machines) and even with that functionality, it does not always work. Unfortunately, I only found this out after buying it. The problem, as claimed by the Splashtop developers, is that &quot;there is no standardized audio API in Windows XP&quot; (isn't that what DirectSound does?). If, like me you still run XP for media server purposes, this makes Splashtop effectively useless as an alternative for streaming content.The app will still work great as a &quot;tv remote&quot; for HTPCs or as a simple method of managing a headless server, but for one of its major selling points, it is not worth even the sale price.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I downloaded it on to my kindle and I enjoyed watching it instantly. No problems purchasing or downloading it. Amazon made it easy for me to purchase things like this movie for my kindle.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|If u get this game u well be addicted.I love this game cause it fun play this game and u well LOVE IT plzz play this games
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Plain and simple information upon request without all the add based garbage you get from bing our google.  Loving it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this! I highly recomend it to kids and adults. I have all the story's on my kindle fire. they all work great!! also they are all fun! u never get bored!<br /><br />one more thing: HEY PARENTS. YA YOU! STOP SAYING MEAN COMMENTS!! SURE MAYBE UR KIDS DONT HAVE COMMON SENSE TO NOT BUY THE GEMS. IF THEY DONT THEY ARE PROBABLY YOUNG (2-4) IF THEY ARE THEN Y WOULD U LET THEM USE UR DEVICE? THT MEANS U DONT HAVE COMMON SENSE CAUSE U PROBABLY KNOW THEY WILL SPEND THE MONEY ON STUFF LIKE THAT SUCH AS ADDS OR MONEY FOR THE GAME!! S T O P
B004RJMUJO|5.0|this game is awesome I love fruit but is fun slicing them tooand seeing how many points you get and how many blades you unlock
B0052VUNHC|5.0|i am a fourteen year old girl that thought this book was AMAZING. i dont know why people are bragging on this.. i especially dont know why old people are reading this.. its a teen drama not a &#34;bitch and moan&#34; type of book! if yu are going to readthis book.. yu should, it was great, i loved it!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|played this on my kindle fire for a couple of hours and it worked ok but now it force closes everytime. sad I actually liked it too
0545265355|5.0|I was able to save money by purchasing on Amazon.  I loved that my 10 yr old son, my 21 yr old daughter and myself are all enjoying this collection. we have all enjoyed sharing and talking about The Hunger Games
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very fun and exciting i highly recomend to read it! I am looking foward to the movie!<br />And the price is great! Make sure you read it before the movie though don't spoil it! ;) Lol

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Is there no end to the number of words Ms. James can misspell?  Nieman's?  The store is Neiman-Marcus.  The shoe designer is Louboutin, NOT \\"Laboutin\\".  And so on.<br /><br />Does Ana eat yogurt or yoghurt?  Please let us know when you decide, Ms James.  In the USA we use the bathroom, not the \\"ensuite.\\"  Our babies are walked in carriages or strollers, not prams.  Most people here are not usually \\"keen\\" skiers, as much as they may enjoy the sport. And the author's description of Pacific Northwest geography is nothing if not puzzling.  Does she really not have access to a map over there?<br /><br />This whole mess made me want to -gasp- Roll My Eyes.  But since there is eye-rolling on almost every other page, I won't. It would be -oh my gosh- too juvenile.  Besides, the author already has that covered.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Widgets simply disappeared after a few hours... what kind of crappy app is this. Glad it was free, total waste of time and space.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great fun. I love this app. I play it all the time and I am addictied to unlocking and geting more games
0399256385|4.0|Well, it's another Spot book, which our son loves. It is also a board book so he won't destroy it too quickly (he's one). While it has the great \\"reveal\\" flaps that he loves so much in the other Spot books, the panels are really quite small for his little hands. In other Spot books they are larger panels to reveal the pictures below, but I felt a little disappointed in the small size of the curtains. They didn't seem to have the same impact on him as ones like [[ASIN:0142501255 Spot's Birthday Party (color)]]. Pro: board book with better pages. Con: small reveal panels.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|the game was fun until the force started coming up everytime after I tried to make a combination don't download the game it is a waste of time
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is similar to other games you might find at sites like coolmathgames.com online.  The premise is simple, but the execution might make you scratch your head until you get that &quot;Aha!&quot; moment.  Teaches kids to think ahead--always a good idea!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I don't have to worry about taking my paper Back Bible out and about and ruining it more. with this app I take the Bible everywhere.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|The force close is a problem but otherwise this is a good game.  I also wish you could adjust settings to turn off finding the same element combinations over and over again.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Breaking Dawn is a \\"Must Read\\"!!!  I couldn't put the book down!!! The Twilight book series is far better than the movies.  You'll be living every Vampire battle with Stephanie Meyer's descriptive style of writing!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This was a good book. I really enjoyed the story line as well as all of the characters. There were many surprises in the book that I loved. I love the romance in this book. I can really relate to cinder. I want her to be happy. I want her to have the love that she deserves. She is amazing and this book is great!!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This ap is a pretty ap. It is just a few weather tools set on top of a live wallpaper that changes based on the weather.<br /><br />I gave it one star because there are no widgets, you can't add this to your home page. It is just.an app you have to open to see. No updates no quick weather references. Not worth having right now. WX Channel is better.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This game started out great. The graphics, sounds and music, were all entertaining and fitting. Very unique idea for a game. I would have given this game 5 stars but, it kept force closing on me.<br /><br />Please update soon for those of us who would like to complete the game.
0439023491|5.0|Picking up where Hunger Games left off, this second installment propels the reader forward with vigor and intensity.  The pace seems much faster than the first, almost a sense of urgency, which matches perfectly with the plot and storyline.  I spent one morning driving to work flooded with an array of emotions including gasps of shock to tears of sadness to downright anger leaving me with a desire to scream at my audio device.  Upon finishing the second book I immediately started the audio for Mockingjay.  This book left me on the edge of my seat just waiting to see what would happen next in this often gut wrenching plot with characters so real my heart bleeds for them.

1468161660|4.0|I downloaded the free sample of this book first, but it didn't take me long to realize I needed to buy the whole novel. This was a very well-written, emotionally charged book. Eighteen-year-old Layken (\\"Lake\\") moves from Texas to Michigan with her mother and younger brother after the death of her father. Minutes after arriving at their new rental house, they meet their neighbors from across the street--a boy around the same age as her brother, and his older brother Will. Lake and her family easily make friends with Will and his younger brother, and Will asks Lake out on a date. She has what she describes as one of the best nights of her life, and then Will has to go out of town with his brother for a few days. She sees him again on Monday, in a most unexpected place, and their worlds are turned upside down.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I totally fell in love with the character of Will and I fear I can't do him justice in my review. There were times I was *sighing* after he did something romantic, and other times I wanted to scream at him for some of his choices. I also shed a few tears at certain parts of the book. That's what makes a good book to me...something I can get emotionally invested in.<br /><br />I was really happy with my purchase and even happier when I finished and saw there was a sequel already on Amazon. I downloaded it quickly and cannot wait to begin reading it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A must to have: your notes, important stuffs, everything constantly up to date, everywhere.<br />Download it immediately if you use your kindle for work purpose.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|No force closes here. Pretty cool game a good way to kill time. Very much like the other classic combo games, for now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a classic that I have reread several times.  You empathize with Ender while cheering him and his peers on in their training and final battle.  The \\"surprise\\" ending provides a plot twist.  This book is such a touchstone of military science fiction that you will occasionally find references in other author's books.  It brings together military science fiction, hero coming of age, alien wars and good rollicking fun for children.  It can be read on many levels.  A must read for serious fans of military science fiction.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Olypians the Lightning Thief is by far the best book i have ever read its funny, lifelike, action pacted, and filled with Greek mythology. This story is about twelve year old Percy Jackson finds himself to be a demigod (half god half human) and thrown into a world of greek gods and godeses and monsters. he is clamied by his long lost father and with his new friends Grover and Annabeth travels to Los Angeles to return the master bolt Zues the rulers sign of power withbthe prophice im his head.  you will travel west to battle the god who has turned you will find what was lost and see it safely returned you will betrayed by one who calls you friend and fail to save what matters most in the end. I guess you have to read the rest from there.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book does not have the battle scenes nor does the plot twist as in the original Ender story.  But Orson Scot Card tells a good entertaining story.  More points are fleshed out without becoming too mystical as Card sometimes has a tendency to do in some of his books.  If you like Enders series, you will like this one.  If your only exposure is original Ender you may find it slightly different and a little slower paced.
0060873027|5.0|I'm a fan of both Crichton and Preston, and liked this Crichton/Preston collaboration a lot.  It was thought-provoking.  Lots of unexpected plot twists made it a fast and exciting read.  Overall a very good book, especially if you enjoy science fiction and action.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|been any good faotd in the past month??? seriously most of these apps are garbage and out of date already free on another market..waste of time
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this app is one of the best apps I have. it comes in great when you want to read in the dark and don't want to get up to turn on a light. so two thumbs up! :D
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it lets you play a lot of ales for.free and its fun to try and earn more points. In conclusion I love it!!!!
0374275637|3.0|Good book. The author received a Nobel prize for his work on prospect theory. This book describes various biases in human decision making. In particular I like that the author speaks with the authority of being a scientist. The drawback is that the writing might not be super-inspiring. Still, I prefer a scientist writing over a nobody who thinks he can write as well as Malcolm Gladwell.<br /><br />A key problem with the book is that the author focuses far too on the research that he has been involved in. As other reviewers have pointed out, this makes the book somewhat repetitive. I would have preferred a bit up-to-date treatment and much more synthesizing of works by other scholars.<br /><br />A good book, but such a prominent scholar should have accomplished a bit more
B0063IH60K|4.0|The title says it all. There could be fewer ads. One per game is a bit excessive. game play is smooth.
B007BLCGNU|3.0|I was curious about this movie and for the most part, enjoyed it. Not a great movie, but it was interesting (to me). Nothing groundbreaking, but there were points in it that enlightened me to who he was and the era in which he lived.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|force closes basically every time. i have an evo shift. i've played this online before and liked it and was excited to see the other &quot;chapters&quot; but closes every time i try to play. too bad
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Well, I thought I'd give it a shot. It seems like it could be fun, but I only managed to get to 36 elements on my Kindle. Now it force closes every time I try to combine the fern with something. I'm sure there are other bad items that cause the FC, but I'm not inclined to spend a lot of time trying to figure it out.  Hopefully there will be an update to fix this.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm pretty impressed that by the end of day yesterday the dev had already released a patch to address the FC issue.  I downloaded it, and it does seem to have fixed the game - no more force closes so far, and I'm clicking away like crazy.  Upping my rating to 4 stars - I'm leaving one off because as another reviewer stated the game could use a feature to prevent you from remaking the same matches, or maybe not show duplicate matches in the list so that it doesn't get too confusing.  Other than that it's pretty fun.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Yeah if it would stop force closing this game would be great! This problem needs to be fixed please :)
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Total waste of of time and space. No widgets!? Seriously? No GPS location? These are basic functions on Android. We don't want junky IOS apps here.. Keep them where they belong with the toy OS... Android is a bit more advanced and sophisticated than that.
B005D63RQK|5.0|The entire series of Breaking Bad to date has been phenomenal. Most impressed with the script writing, acting and directing.<br />Overall truly great in all departments of the production.
0553801473|2.0|I loved the first three books.  I was hoping the 4th was a fluke, but after finally getting through a Dance with Dragons I am bored.  I actually couldn't read more than one chapter without falling asleep.  I feel like half of this book could have been cut out and still gotten to the same ending point.  I would love to know how the story ends, but I don't think I can get through another book like this without knowing when the end is.
144234430X|4.0|I'll be honest here and state that the premise of this book didn't really grab me when I first read a blurb.  I was born several years after the assassination of JFK and missed the whole Camelot era of the Kennedy's and can only see them as tragic figures.  I don't share those nostalgic feelings for the era and almost passed on this book. But then I saw it at my library as an unabridged audiobook and grabbed it because I'll read anything on audio.  And besides, I usually dig King's work.  When I started this I remembered why.  The man has mad storytelling skills.  Immediately I was taken back to that other strange-to-me era, learning a good number of things and not once did I regret spending a good chunk of my week listening to 11/22/63.<br /><br />Jake is a likable high school English teacher who is given the secret to a \\"rabbit hole\\" that allows him to go back in time and attempt to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  He is told this secret by his dying friend Al and seeing as Al has aged decades overnight he's apt to believe him, crazy as it all sounds.  But before he sets off to save the world he decides on a trial run.  Al says he'll be gone only 2 minutes of 2011 time, no matter how long he stay in the past, so he decides to test it out by saving a former student from a heart-wrenching, life-altering event.  Returning to 2011 he discovers the changes stuck but things don't work out quite as he planned.  Determined to fix things and this time save Kennedy, he steps back through the rabbit hole again.<br /><br />This bulk of the rest of book takes place in the late 1950's and early 1960's as Jake, now George, bides his time for that fateful date, making friends, changing lives, finding love and causing ripples with every move he makes.  The past, George learns, doesn't take kindly to changes and terrible things happen to him and those he grows to love whenever he makes a big move and they're often described in all their grisly, gory glory.  It was a grueling, heartbreaking read but also warm and funny and one where you root for the main character to win all the way through.<br /><br />King does a fabulous job with his characters (as always) but it's his setting as much as his people that truly pop out of the book and make it all come alive.  The research must've been exhausting and though I can't vouch for its accuracy (and surely he fudged some of it), I can say I was definitely transported to another time as I listened to the narrator expertly spin King's tale of time-travel, hope, loss, love and desperation.  If you can, I highly recommend \\"reading\\" it this way, the narration is fabulous (no monotonous narrator here) and brings it all to vivid life.  I'm not going to lie, this book is long and a mite too long-winded, especially towards the middle as George goes about his daily business and follows mean, boring Lee Harvey Oswald around, but the thought of stopping it for something else never crossed my mind.  This is a book I needed to finish because I cared so deeply about George and Sadie and all of their friends.  It's good stuff!ling, heartbreaking read but also warm and funny and one where you root for the main character to win all the way through.<br /><br />King does a fabulous job with his characters (as always) but it's his setting as much as his people that truly pop out of the book and make it all come alive.

B001P9EQH8|4.0|I bought this because I was tired of the volume mismatch between the radio and CD modes of my car stereo with the aux input.  I had to crank up the volume for my music player and would often forget to turn it down when I was done. I'd get reminded when I started up the car, switched to the radio and got the icepick in the ear.  As a booster this device works fine.  I don't have to readjust the volume control on the car stereo when I plug my music player into the aux input.  I set both the music player and the amp to max volume but I can live with that.<br /><br />A lot of reviews have criticized this device for not improving the sound.  This is an amplifier.  It increases the gain. It does have buffered output.  It will only improve the sound if there's a significant impedance mismatch between your player and the device (headphones, line input) it's plugged into. I've seen detailed audio tests of this device with screen shots of things like frequency response and distortion over the normal sound spectrum.  It performs like you'd expect a low power amp to perform.  Flat frequency response and negligible distortion.  No boost above 500 Hz as one reviewer states.<br /><br />It's not an audio panacea.  It won't make your equipment sound better in any way unless there's the impedance match mentioned above.  It does add some gain and doesn't alter the signal appreciably.  I'd like a bit more gain than this unit provides since I use it at max volume, but other than that I'm perfectly satisfied.  To tell the truth, I'd be perfectly happy with no volume control at all.  The bass boost switch doesn't have much audible effect.  I could do without that too.  I do like having a power switch.
B0063GORYU|5.0|what a fun and challenging twist on the traditional solitaire game. it helps keep my mind working at a higher level
B003Q3F0OE|5.0|Poignant, contemplative, well-rounded film with top-notch acting, beautiful cinematography, and stirring soundtrack.  I am surprised that a film of this caliber was not released in the theaters.  I would love to see more of this kind of work.
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun kinda addicting...a little slow at first to get used to,But you get the hang of it pretty quickly.  I had to restart it allover once I figured it out to plan my city
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games on here are really fun but some of them are hard to beat and the you cant earn money to unlock other games. overall this is a fun game
0439023521|1.0|After reading \\"The Hunger Games,\\" I couldn't believe how disturbing it was.  Especially the end dying scene with the prolonged agony.  Basically, if you enjoy the sadistic torture of teenagers, this book is for you.  If not, skip it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Glitch is fixed, I've lost at least a day to this game.  I love it.  I even dreamed about it.  Best game on my kindle.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I had fun playing this morning till it kept force closing..I checked and they updated...and fast too probably for all the complaints..too bad it got bad reviews because of the glitches. I cant wait till it finishes installing!

B00122IYJY|4.0|Great to have a Van Halen song on my phone when all else fails to work....  Most of the songs are good and a good deal foe the price...................
0553801473|3.0|I really sorry to say this but this is as boring as book four (A Feast for Crows. I understand that book 5 was suppose to be the parallel book to book 4. Maybe that's why Martin just continues to ramble on.<br />We go back to characters that are left out of 4 and now brought back in 5. The narrative is repetitive and just covers points that were in early chapters. Did he forget what he was writing about?<br />I enjoyed the first three books but after 4 and 5 I don't if I'll be waiting for 6.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is very addictive game. Be warned. Every time I want to stop at one level, I will think of playing one more level. Have played in an android tablet, iphone, nexus phone and 10\\" tablet. The experience on tablet is far superior to phones.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Contrary to the impressions that you may have had from seeing Springsteen's appearances on Jimmy Fallon or the Grammy's you may have been given the impression this is a new E Street Band album, it is definitely not.  It is a solo record with a wide variety of players contributing.  E Street Band members make various appearances but Springsteen definitely employed a variety of players. From E Street, the most prominent appears to be Soozie Tyrell whose violin work stands out as she appears on at least 8 tracks.  Also Tom Morello from Rage against the Machine makes appearances on two tracks.  (Jack of All Trades and This Depression)<br />If you are looking for a classic sound in the vein of BTR, Darkness or the River, you will definitely not find that here, so probably best to move on. If you are on board with the various styles Bruce has adopted since around 1992's Human Touch, I don't think this record will disappoint.<br /> There is truly a lot to offer here and a wide variety.  The Highlights for me are the following:<br />- We Take Care of our Own & Wrecking Ball - Good Rockers.  If we still had quality FM radio, We take care of our own would be a hit. Both should be great live.  (Wrecking Ball was already performed on the last tour at the Meadowlands) These are probably the closest to the traditional E Street Band Sound.<br />- Easy Money, Shackled and Drawn, Death to my Hometown, We are Alive and American Land (on the Deluxe Version of the CD) - These 5 tracks have a feel ala the Seeger Sessions.  Enjoy the energy on these. These too should be good live.  American Land obviously was on the Seeger Sessions album (Deluxe version) and was played live on the 2008 + 2009 tours with the E Street Band.  This is the Studio Version.<br />- Jack of All Trades - To me this one has a classic feel to it.  Great Lyrics and horns.  To me this has a feel of an outtake out of the Bruce vaults.  When I listen to this one, makes me wonder how it would sound with a Clarence Clemons sax solo in place of the brass that is in there now.  Unfortunately will never know.<br />- Land of Hope and Dreams - True it was performed nightly on the Reunion Tour and makes an appearance on the Live in NYC album, this is a new Studio Version however complete with Gospel choir and featuring an excellent Sax solo from the Big Man.  I enjoy this version, Detractors will say way over produced.<br />- Rocky Ground - Still a bit undecided on this one.  Has a feel of Streets of Philadelphia when I listen.  Slightly different but has great lyrics.<br />My only complaint is the whole standard / deluxe version thing and this is not unique to Bruce CD's.  For paying the extra few bucks for a deluxe version you get two additional songs.  Nothing else! The booklet appears to be the same.  Why have two versions, clearly the two extra songs would fit onto the disc!  Done for the extra cash obviously!<br /> Overall this is a great new album done in a varied style that I think will appeal strongly to the core fans.  To me, the various styles employed by Bruce are what make his body of work exciting and worthwhile.  That being said, I really don't see this album winning over any new fans and for the ones who continue to clamor for something in the vein of the classic 1975-1980 period, just save yourself and your money and avoid it as it probably will not be to your liking.
0553386794|5.0|I'm not completely finished with the book, but so far I can only say this: incredible! Martin manages to create an intricate plot with multiple well-developed main characters. The summary is spot on when it states that it is a book of plots and counterplots. Every chapter consists of a new surprise that has implications for the rest of the book. Though I do not yet know how the book will end, I am very pleased with it so far (about 400 pages in).

0307341577|5.0|This was honestly the best book I've read in such a long time. The characters are so realistic (everyone knows a Diondra, unfortunately...) that they stick with you long after you stop reading. The way this was written is so unique and original. Gillian Flynn is--without a doubt--my new favorite author.<br /><br />EVERYONE should read this book at least once!

0385737955|5.0|I am a freshman at my school and i have never liked reading. At all. But obviously for English class, we had too. I got a recommendation to read this book and decided to give it a try. From the description and the title, the thing that came to my mind was; \\"a boy who runs a maze. Whoop.\\" But 20 pages in, I couldn't put it down. It's a lot more than just a book about a kid running through a maze, I'm on the second book, The Scorch Trials, and I'm even more addicted to that one. I end up talking to myself in my head! \\"No Thomas! Don't listen to her!\\" But that's just me. I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially if you have a creative mind.

B000URDE2Y|5.0|Born in the 80's, I was not around to experience some of the best guitarists, and some of the best rock bands/artists. But, it soes not mean that I cannot appreciate and groove out to them. Robin Trower's 2nd album, 1974's Bridge of Sighs (tracks 1-8)is in your face boogie/blues rock with multi-layer guitar sounds. James Dewar's blues style vocals are a perfect match for the band's diverse sound. I keep hearing that Trower's guitar sounds are heavily derived from Jimi Hendrix. I do hear some Hendrix acid rock influence in several spots, but it is just an influence. I feel that Trower has his own sound that is textual and deep that does take cues from Hendrix's multi-layer sound.  Let me say that every (and I emphasize EVERY) single song on this album rocks hard and is awesome.  All songs are band originals also. The title track \\"Bridge Of Sighs\\" is now one of my favorite rock songs. It starts with a mellow atmospheric sound for 3 seconds, then a whirlwind guitar riff kicks in, and then the signature slower-rolling, yet heavy, blues kick in, and Dewar's vocals take you to the \\"blues bar\\" in your mind where people go to process the hard times in life. Some songs are in the slower blues vein like the aforementioned, and the moody, twangy, slightly jazzy and slightly psychedelic \\"In This Place.\\" There are some heavy, mid-up tempo boogie jams like the funky \\"Too Rolling Stoned.\\" Dare I say that the first half of the song almost has a slight disco vibe in the tempo but with heavy and twangy giutar riffs(trust me, the funky soulful groove of the song works very well here). Then in the middle of the song, the traditional 12 bar blues riffs kick in for the remainder of the song. \\"Lady Love\\" has an upbeat boogie sound and is a great cruisin' song about longing for the missing element of a woman's love. The opener, \\"Day Of The Eagle,\\" another Trower classic, starts off heavy with some of Trower's signature heavy riffs. The song mellows out towards the end. I love how many of the songs change tempo and style making the listening dynamic. After song 8, there are the bonus jams from around the same time. Another \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" version, without the windy 3 second atmosphere at the start, is present. There is also \\"Alethea,\\" which appears from the band's For Earth Below 1975 album, a uptempo song showing some Hendrix influence but with more of a funk element, an excellent song that should be on Guitar Hero. The other bonus songs are cool as well. I have just started to listen to Robin Trower, Bridge Of Sighs being a starting place for me, and I am hooked. Trower is quickly becoming one of my favorite guitarists for his dynamic skills and his band's incredible chemistry, which is completely evident here on Bridge Of Sighs. I am ordering a few of the Robin Trower band's other albums and am eagerly awaiting them including For Earth Below.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Very good book that kept me interested.  You won't guess the ending until the last few pages.  It is a story about a missing woman.  Her sister, a business woman living in New York, moves back to England to find her.
0393330435|4.0|As a longtime Apple user, I found this very interesting and read it as a prequel to the Steve Jobs biography. An interesting book for Apple fans, but Woz is not a good writer (and that is being kind). Glad I read it and it shed light on the Apple story and the man who brought us the personal computer.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I'm not sure what otherworldly materials and construction they use in this thing but I have never had a sharpener that works as incredibly well as this one.  The thing is just superb.  I have many knives and use most of them A LOT.  The one I carry now I keep sharp with this and it's just spooky how sharp sharp is with this unit.  I've always been a little disappointed with this type of draw through carbide sharpener as they never seemed to work all that great but this one is the exception.  Get it.  You won't be sorry.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This is one of the best in the series.  I think the original, tokyo drift were all great too.  bought this when it was on sale and for what its worth, its a great package being that it comes with Bluray/DVD.<br /><br />Story was well written, I think its more action than it is talking.  Some parts were slow, but, overall it was enough to keep me interested.  You kind of expect certain events to play out and know the outcome.<br /><br />Some cool stunts pulled off in this movie and although in real life this is impossible, but, still its overall entertaining.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I read the reviews and then downloaded this app because I wanted to see if it would force close. it did. this game isn't fun, all you do is combine two things to see if it makes a third thing.
B00009R6H2|5.0|this is a sturdy plate and have more space.  I use my mb-d10 and screw this thing on. Very secured and knowing that it won't come off.  Cheap plates and recommend it
B0063GORYU|5.0|just mindless fun. good for filling time if your waiting and don't want to get too evolved. and the price is right.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I have 2 sb900s and I don't have an issue with overheating.  They must be doing something that I'm not that triggers the overheating problem.  Not once had this happen to me.  I've use full power flash at times and not come to the point of overheating.<br /><br />Once again, every gave specs and details so I will leave it with them.  Personally, this is a powerful flash unit and does at what it does and recycle times are quicker than other flashes.  Yes you do pay the price as this is the most expensive flash from nikon (unless there is another that I don't know about).  I like the fact nikon flashes can be triggered with camera built-in flash<br /><br />Other than the price, I can't think of anything bad
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our family and friends don't get bored with this game.  The idea of changing board in strategy game is just a strike of genius.  I would place it above Monopoly and Risk, which I also enjoy.<br />Materials are durable, only problem is that the \\"sea\\" peaces are hard to keep in place.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I grew up watching alot of wildlife documentaries and am familiar with David Attenborough.  I didn't know his name at the time, but, I know his voice and the way he describes things.  Anyhow, this was a well made film from beginning to end.  Even shots from planet earth is in this.  I have nothing against oprah winfrey narrating but, once again, because I'm use to David, I'm going to stick to the original.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed if you're a fan of planet earth or other documentaries.  It is well made, very creative in their story telling.  It'll make you laugh, sad, and maybe for some make their stomach turn, and other times it captures the \\"wow\\" factor!
B0063IH60K|4.0|lots of fun love playing this game on my kindle fire. and best of all it was free and worth downloading
B000ZNRBK4|4.0|Had no choice but to buy a lens hood as it didn't come with my 18-55 mm.  Plastic is well made, overpriced but I find it necessary.  Blocks unwanted light in my photos at certain angles, and when not in use you could reverse the lens hood and have it on your lens.  That way you don't have to remove it completely but, have it on the lens at all times.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Well they updated the so now the force close is not a problem. That's a good thing in case you didn't know.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|overall this is a great game.  some of the mini games are hard to beat, but with time are all beatable.  great way to pass time.
7119005901|5.0|The books arrived promptly and in excellent condition! I was pleasantly surprised to find the character drawings, ancient maps that described the provinces at the time and the people who ruled over them, and a very in depth reference in the back of the book that went into detail about several of the incidents mentioned in the story and how they relate to historical records. Of course, the story itself is an entertaining read. Highly recommended.
0545265355|5.0|If you have time and you need something to read. Read this series. I couldn't put it down. I am not a fast reader but I finished the first book in two days. I'm not starting the next so that way I can actually get some work done.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This app just will not keep running. After about 20 minutes of playing it force closes.  I am playing it on a Kindle Fire and the game was OK but the force close just kills the fun.  From the look of all the reviews, it needs a lot of work to fix and make people happy again!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I really like it. I wouldn't get it for 3 dollars though so I'm really glad its free today. Its a thinking game so i recommend it for people who like puzzles.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I bought two copies of this DVD movie directly from Amazon. The package looks the same as the picture. The Disc has \\"Sony DVD-R make.believe MAGDA-32016\\" engraved on it. There is no graphics on the back of disc, title looks handwritten. is there anyone else having this problem? If this is wrong, I need to return them. It also has \\"DVD VIDEO Rated R for brutal ...\\" printed on it. Please let me know if anyone received the same product from Amazon. Thanks!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I put in all my home data like air filter size, car type, license plate, tire sizes, vehicle data, and then retrieve it all from my phone or aneroid pad.  Great for all note taking.
B004EPYZQC|3.0|This is a fun movie to watch - lots of action, really sweet fast cars, very hot women (But there's one that's a little too skin and bones for me...) but several are very HOT... - I've seen all 5 of the fast and furious movies and this is the best of the 5, the first is very good also.  Some of the stunts were obviously very dangerous and I was like no way they'd be dead (over and over again) - sometimes my prior physics/engineering training keeps me from really enjoying a movie because I can see how unrealistic they are ...  but it's fun and some of the scenes are just classic ..  it's a little slow at times and lost my attention - so that's why I'm giving this 3 stars because if it could keep me glued then it would get more - and it isn't getting more because it isn't realistic enough to hold my attention all the way but honestly it's a very fun movie to watch - enjoy
B004T2QZL8|2.0|As seen in the other reviews, this is a pretty fun game, but closes after a few minutes on the kindle Fire.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I have read every single of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. It took me a DAY each to read all the books. Percy Jackson is the new Harry Potter, in my opinion. The Lightning Thief was an incredible movie! It is on my list of top 10 movies! It was FANTASTIC and I watched it so many times and never got bored of it. I can't wait for the new Sea of Monsters DVD to come out next year! And I hope they include the part about Thalia's pine tree (which they deleted out of the 1st movie, sadly) because it is a very imporant part in the entire series.<br />I hope they make DVDs for all of the books because I just can't wait.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I was hoping to escape the forced.close curse, but no. This is such an awesome game, please fix it! It's terrible to get so addicted and then have to stop 15 minutes into it. I'm on a Kindle Fire. if that helps.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game might be fun to place if it didn't have so many force close issues.  I honestly haven't experienced an app that has forced closed this many times.  I think that it would be an enjoyable game if I could actually play it.  They have another app - Doodle Devil - I hope that it isn't a glitchy as this one.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a really good game. But after a while, it force closes after every element you make. Even if the element you want to make doesn't work, it still force closes. Playing is fun. It truly is. But if the workers aren't going to search for bugs and problems, I'm just going to be done playing. (P.S. giving it five stars to make rating good.)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the ease of this app and having different translation in one place. I'm finding the reading plans could be better.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|it was the best game ever unil I saw that force quit button every time I opened the app. I would never dare to suggest this app because it is all for nothing. To me suggesting this app is a prude insult and be warned..... DO NOT GET THIS APP
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Not a good one. Don't waste your time. It drains the memory and is not worth it. I deleted it as soon as I got it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so awesome I just love how many games there are on this app. If you don't get the app and enjoy it you have a problem, no offense
B006OCM0G0|3.0|it fools you when it says (free app) it is not free trust me.without buying gems, it is a good game and addicting..it puts down your credit card.this is so expensive
B004T2QZL8|1.0|need to make pocket frogs.  please make pocket frogs the game. make pocket frogs for the kindle please. make pocket frogs for kindle.
B005VKMB42|5.0|I just saw Birdie on Ellen....it was her debut in the USA. She is an amazing 15 year old prodigy. I am anxious to receive my CD !!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very cool game.  has a bunch of quick and addictive games that help to pass the time.  definitely worth getting.
B000002IXS|5.0|I have this album on a cassette and wanted to have a copy of it on a CD so I could put it on my iPod.  I couldn't find it on iTunes, so I checked Amazon and sure enough, they had it.  Mireille, in my humble opinion, has the best voice of all the French singers -- even better than Edith Piaf, whose songs she is reprising here.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|i got this app on my kindle fire and it works perfectly fine. all those people that say that it forces close u guys are wrong.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I bought the first book (kindle version), not knowing it was a trilogy...by the end of this book, I was very glad to know there was more!! Let me just put it to you this way: I bought Fifty on March 13th and immediately started reading it. Ignored my whole family until about 3 hours ago, when I had finished the third book. Yeah..couldn't put the sucker(s) down. Uber sexual (yum), and as someone else pointed out, not for prudes (unless you're looking to finally wake up and smell the coffee!). I kind of hate that people are calling this 'mommy porn' (barf), but who am I to judge?? I, too, am a young mom, and I found the read delectable. After he asked me what I was so engrossed in reading last night, to which I responded by citing a line referring to \\"butt plugs\\", Husband wants to read it now..uh oh for me. :S<br /><br />The ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars is due to the many similarities between this trilogy and Twilight (minus hottie Edward McVampenstein), though honestly, who really cares? Much like after Twilight, I again have been enticed to leave my husband in search of someone who is loaded beyond reason, wants me to spend it, and will spank my hind quarters...<br /><br />Just read them...enjoy...(you perv ;) )
1400064287|4.0|Just picked this up after about, oh, 20 recommendations from friends...what a read! If you want to learn how to make your idea memorable, your business successful, your wedding invitations enticing, or just how to get peoples' attention - you need this book.
0375842209|5.0|I mostly agree with Alexis who reviewed before me. For me, this book was not depressing, sad yes but Death had a certain humour as he told the story. I too experienced at times especially towards the end that I wanted to slow down and reread sections to completely absorb what I was reading. It was that powerful. Things were very impressive. I also felt that I didn't know where the author was going in the beginning. I was reassured by two friends who read it to stay with it. It didn't take long to get rolling. After finishing my read I went back to better absorb the beginning. I felt like I knew Liesel and being a father of two girls of ages 15 and 13, I would have adopted her myself. I also found myself trying to visualize what she would look like. This would be a great movie, but nonetheless a high impact read for me. If you are interested in WWII and Germans who may not have supported Hitler, persecuted Jews and have compassion for innocent children who dealt with undeserved tragedy you should read this book. By the way, I am not an avid reader(but working on it) and this book is about 550 pages, at like page 400 I was disappointed to see I had only 150 pages left!!! Didn't want it to end.
B000002VMD|4.0|Upon Whitney Houston's passing I knew that I had to have a copy of some of her songs. Having seen the \\"Bodyguard\\" several times, the soundtrack from that movie was what I wanted to own. I am very happy with my CD.
B00023B1LM|5.0|great dvd nice dvd great service i enjoy the dvd and can watch it over and over again so you can see i like it
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Seems like a fun game and I have heard a lot of good things about it. Only problem is that just a little bit into the game it would crash every time I tried to combine elements. So now it loads just fine but crashes every time anything tries to combine. If this issue was fixed I would happily give it 5 stars.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|there are lots of crashes. for me it didn't start till I discovered the beast. now it wont let me create anything. other than that it was really great!
B004I2K4E8|4.0|Most of what needs said has been said.  There are a few points that need driven home.<br /><br />1. Alfie Boe is a \\"singers\\" Jean Valjean.  No, he doesn't have a character voice like Colm.  But wow... this guy has chops and he delivers with so much heart.  To not love him suggests you're maybe too sentimental about Colm.<br /><br />2. Jonas as Marius is every bit as awful as everyone says.  I simply can't excuse this casting.  I can't believe, during dress rehersals, Jonas himself didn't say, \\"Wow, am I outmatched here.  Better for everyone if I move to the chorus.\\"  He's a community theater voice at best.  That, and the lacking stage presence, looks, and acting ability make his performance uncomfortable to watch.  It really is staggering.<br /><br />My wife and I have been fans since the 80's.  We were both riveted to this performance.  Everyone is so good that we happily suffered through Jonas to hear the others.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is lots of fun and easy to figure out.<br />It is now on my phone and my kindle fire.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I like how the key works on my tablet. but the main app is not. thats kind of funny. lol
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I can't help but feel that Stephanie Meyer (author of the Twilight series) has written this book. The writing style mimics the same adolescent, immature format that many Tweens rave over. This is a great trashy novel, but don't expect any intellectual depth to the story or writing. The are a lot of repetitions with the same phrases over and over, and for goodness sake, this book needs a good editor; there are numerous typographical errors. Also, this author is definitely britsh, and makes numerous references to Europe and Britian in the book--the book horribly portrays American culture. Despite these flaws, the story is indulging enough, like gossip around the office. The story's plot is simple and keeps the reader engaged in between all of the sex and orgasms. Honestly, I feel like this book is a R-rated young adult erotica which doesn't satisfy the mind of an adult with experience. Great for a summer read at the beach or to help time pass by.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some fun games, some rather stupid, but is what is promised in the description. I really hate the fish game, the bubble doesn't move when I put my finger on it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I really enjoyed this app. the graphics are enjoyable and I found the doodle God entertaining to say the least. I found the humour was share worthy as I tracked down my husband to tell him what 'apple' and 'cellphone' created.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app. it's great how it syncs with phone and computer.  great way to keep lists between different hardware. be sure to use
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Started off working great now an hour later it forces closed when I try to combine elements.  Seems like a common problem for there version.  Samsung Galaxy S.  Glad it was the free app of the day and I didnt waste money on it.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I opened this app and saw a butterfly once on a level. I opened it up again, and it was a swarm of locusts! and all of the water turned to blood, too. danger...
B004N6369Y|5.0|Hotel Vendôme by Danielle Steel<br />Hugh has built a hotel that is fit for a king or queen. After a few years his wife leaves them and he gets to raise their daughter which he has no problem doing.<br />His whole life is Heloise and the hotel.<br />As years go by Heloise also loves the hotel business and applies to a Swiss school to get further training. She gets in and he finds himself lost while she's gone so he undertakes a new project: redoing some of the larger suites.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|Some levels are real brain stumpers, but that's okay- this game is made for playing in small doses. It's got great, albeit simple graphics, and the lack of background music is actually refreshing to me. Awesome game for those moments where you need a diversion.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was all the rage on the radio and TV. Everyone said it was totally hot. Everyone don't know erotica from a hole in rhe ground, apparently. It doesn't surprise me at all that this book was originally Twilight fan fiction. The author apparently went to the Stephanie Meyers School of No One Will Notice If I Am Maddeningly Repetitive. The sex is stupid (the protagonist calls her vagina &#34;down there&#34;? Really? Why not just call it a hooha if we're going to be 5?) the characters are all predictably gorgeous,  and the fact that this stupid girl is apparently ridiculously multi orgasmic will only piss you off. Read Nancy Friday, Nancy Madore, or Elaine McCarthy if you want to get hot and bothered. This will only bore you.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It keeps crashing. Lame! thought it sounded cool and it worked for a while but now it won't even open.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Great puzzle game!  It makes me feel stupid ehen I finally figure it out.  It exercises your brain.  A winner!
068817776X|5.0|I have read this numerous times and recommended it to many people. Well written and gripping in the details of life at the time, this will challenge you.  Sometimes, not a comfortable read, it is an important record of what happened.<br /><br />Come to the book with an open mind and be prepared to read it in one sitting!
1439156816|5.0|Stephen King is one of the best-selling authors of all-time.  He is a prolific writer with books and movies that are an iconic part of our culture.<br /><br />Based on another best-selling author's (Nicholas Sparks) recommendation, this book, \\"On Writing\\", was recommended for all writers.<br /><br />I do not like to read horror novels.  But, Stephen King's book is a textbook example on generating and creating ideas or situations to make your writing interesting.  Writing is a craft.  Learn this craft from one of the best.<br /><br />Even his short stories have become great movies.  In my opinion, the best movie ever made is the movie, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\".  The movie derived from one of Stephen King's short stories.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanany: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Game was fun for ten minutes then began force closing, fix that it's a decent game. And to think I got this for free.
0439023513|1.0|I enjoyed the first 2 books & wrote reviews for both, but this one I can honestly say I hated, & everything other reviewers have written regarding why they didn't like it I can fully relate to. I felt like I had been sucker punched when I got to the final pages & was quite depressed. For half the book Katniss was either sedated or recovering from something, & yet still she went to battle. In the end she was just a Pawn & repeatedly betrayed. Too may loose ends & unexplained conclusions. I wasn't convinced that Katniss truly loved Peeta & it was a match made in heaven, more like to 2 damaged, unstable, dysfunctional people who ended up with one another because really, what was the alternative?<br />I didn't buy in to Gale just leaving, he was her rock, he saved her family & they had a strong bond, at least that's what we were led to believe. Prim's death was totally unnecessary, & their mother just leaving to go to another district when her daughter \\"The Mockingjay\\" was so fragile..please! The final pages which were supposed to sum up Katniss & Peeta's life together seemed like a rushed attempt to get the book to print.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Same as everyone else, a few elements in and boom, its a crash and force close for me. Fix it or I will removing it.<br />This free app isn't really worth it!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The hype that has followed this book is truly deserved. It is a fast-paced and incredibly intelligent read that I recommend to any and all readers.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This is a really fun game along the lines of Alchemy but it is only up to a point when it stops letting you combine elements and force closes. Until it is fixed its one star. Please fix it. I have an HTC Thunderbolt
B0066W1AZK|5.0|this has really helped me to play chess better. tho the player is hard to beat its still really fun
B004T2QZL8|2.0|pretty fun game up until it crashed. it doesnt play at all anymore, just crashes every time i play it. i have an LG optimus v
B004T2QZL8|2.0|fun game please fix the bug..it keeps crashing! apparently im not the only one getting this. word number twenty. thanks
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Are you guys really this stupid?<br />No Widgets, no radar.<br />Stupid, glad I got it free because it's getting deleted!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game when your trying to pass the time. my kids love it. all of the games keeps everyone entertained.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|As observed by other reviewers, the force close issue makes this game almost unplayable but when it does work it's fun.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is awesome don't listen to those other people, they don't know what there talking about. I suggest the game and all the other story's.
B006P0FICE|1.0|The action scenes were ok.  Dialogue was terrible; choppy; awkward.  Since I know most of these actors are amazing, it must have been the writing/directing that flopped it.  The word \\"Yep\\" was used.  If not for the famous actors, it would have been a \\"B\\" movie all around.  Turrible.  Turrible, turrible, turrible.  D'Artagnan not convincing.  To top it all off, the song for the credits was someone singing and playing an acoustic guitar.  One more time:  turrible.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|It would be nice to have a fast forward button.it takes a day to cook some things...literally and hours for some.I had to keep feeding my customers French toast because it only takes a min.and I want more gems!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|The game is really fun until you get to the point where it starts force closing every time you try a combination. Then it is unplayable.<br /><br />ETA: The update fixed the force close issue.  I am now having fun playing the game.  I appreciate the responsiveness of the developer to the problem.  It was fixed really quickly.<br /><br />For the game itself, every time you make a match, you get a pithy quote related to the new element you have just created.  I am enjoying those.  You also have the ability to ask for hints on a regular basis, which can become essential as you work your way through - the number of elements can become overwhelming.  One feature I do wish the game had was that it would let you know when you had tried a particular combination before.  It can be difficult to remember - then when that combination works again and you are taken to the new element screen, it can be hard to remember which groups you were working with.  One of two things (that I can think of) would solve this issue: either don't allow you to recreate an element over and over, or have some sort of a back button that allows you to go right back to the screen you just left so that you can more easily remember where you were in your process of trying to find a match.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|so addicting, but it just started force closing. which is sad. please fix, so I can re-review! had fun while it.lasted ....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is an amazing game and I love how the kindle has it set up. It is easy to use and you can use it anywhere.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I like it, it is what it is people are rating because they don't like the game I think but its good for what it is.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|I was recently in the market for a headset.  I tried the X41's (bought at Best Buy).  I have quite a few wireless devices in my house, including a dual mode router - Linksys E1000.<br /><br />No matter where I used this headset in my house I got intermittent pops and crackles along with an audible hum/hiss when there was no sound from a source.  When the earphones work, they do work well.  The sound was solid, if not overwhelming, and they did a very solid job while watching TV or playing Mass Effect 3 on the Xbox 360.<br /><br />But the very jarring interruptions and POPS made the experience a little bit like a game of Russian Roulette.  I knew the pops were going to happen, but you never know exactly when.  And if you have the volume up on the headset to hear some low level conversation from a game or movie, the pop was not just jarring but painful.<br /><br />The other downside to these is that they are pretty heavy.  Not greatly uncomfortable, but not really something I'd enjoy wearing for extended periods.<br /><br />I returned the headset after 4 days.  As such I cannot comment on battery life.<br /><br />Pro:  Decent to great sound quality, now only $119 due to the imminent release of the X42s (which should solve con #1)<br /><br />Cons:  Terrible wireless connection, heavy<br /><br />By way of comparison, I followed up my purchase of the X41's by buying a pair of the Astro A30's with the Wireless MixAmp 5.8.  There is simply no comparison.  The Astros are better in every category.  There is ZERO wireless interference, and the sound quality is extremely rich.  The headset is also a lot lighter on the head, and has a removeable boom mic.  The Astros are also usable with other sources - so I can easily hook them into my phone or computer or anything with a headphone jack.  This is because the wireless tranmission is handled by an external box (which you may love or may hate).  The Turtle Beach headset can only be used with base.  This was a big turnoff.<br /><br />I can't recommend enough spending the extra money for the Astro's or to just wait for the X42's.<br /><br />I would tend to avoid the X41's based on my experience.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is without question my favorite show of all time. The acting is superb, the atmosphere tense, and the acting it out of this world. Breaking Bad trumps Sopranos, The Wire, and Mad Men. It's not even close.

B0061S073A|5.0|Thank you for creating a safety for the kindle fire!  My 2 year old uses my kindle all the time for her toddler apps.  Even though she clicks on links to the web through ads in the applications, she cant see the web sites and cant accidentally order anything. Thanks again for keeping her safe
B000FC10HA|5.0|If you have a book to read for Marketing no doubt! this is it ... the book concept and insight are just great. I recommend this book. Idea's development are short but clear to the point . People who do not have experience this book should be your bible .
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love this game, although I have yet to win it.<br /><br />The basic premise allows for creative growth, both strategically and inter-personally (there's a lot of good teasing that goes along with trading).  Overall, I wish I had discovered it at a younger age!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am a Pastor of a Church and I Use this Bible App often. The search function is so great. You just need to remember a few words of scripture and hit the search button and you can quickly scan through the list that was generated. And if you are pretty certain that the verse you are looking for is in the New Testament - you can select the search to look through the new testament only. This quickly narrows down the search. I would not want to be without this Bible App now that I have seen how much time it saves me in finding the Scriptures I am looking for. You will Love it also.<br />Pastor : Jim
B004T2QZL8|2.0|The game force closes every combination. I'm on a new, unbroken, updated, new DROID. Free so they can get a bunch of close reports so they don't have to do the work.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|really is a wonderful Bible app!! i love that I can get different versions of the Bible and even devotionals
B004T2QZL8|2.0|It's really fun, but after about 10 minutes it always gets a force close error. It won't let you do anything from there. You can go to manage apps, and clear data. Then you have to start over?<br /><br />Fix that and it will be really cool!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Took a while to get here. Normally super saving shipping doesn't take to long but it did this time, took 1 week before shipping and then recieved in a couple of days. If it waqs in stock I don't understand why it took so long to get out of the shop and into the shipping main stream. Anyway, Got here finally.<br /> The knife is a 1/4 inch thick all the way through. It is one Honk'en knife. I don't think you really realize how stout and thick this thing is till you hold it. The pictures online and in catalogs don't do it justice. It seems kind of hard to sharpen and get a really good egde on it ( just got it ). I don't think you will break this knife, it is heavy duty and could be used as a hammer ( because it is heavy ) and has a window breaking type edge on the rear. The blade tip could be used to break glass also due to it's thickness. The only down side to this knife is the sheath. It  has a plastic type, locking sheath with a cheap nylon belt loop. The handles are plastic type but seem grippy enough for me but I wrapped them with Para-Cord for a better grip.<br /> I was having a hard time deciding wether to get the Gerber LMF2 or the BK2. I watched some youtube torture test on the LMF2 which were pretty impressive and couldn't find anything on the BK2. If you are looking for a survival knife I think the Gerber LMF2 would be a better choice, if you are wanting a woods knife that won't let you down and you don't have to worry about breaking the BK2 is for you.<br />This knife also is available for Military and Law Enforcement ONLY in a partially serrated blade which would be great for this knife and can be reviewed on KABAR's web site.<br /><br />I would not recommend this knife for a woman because it is HEAVY. This is not a fighting knife and I would not put it on my entry vest  due to the wieght and the cheap sheath. It can not be welded in your hands quickly for a fighting knife but I wouldn't worry about opening cans or even a ammo cam or car door for that matter you won't damage this knife and if you did there is still a bunch of steel to work with. I can not emphasize the thickness of this knife enough. Pictures don't do it justice. Buy One.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have done this workout dvd 4 days now to replace the days I don't go to the gym in which I usually spend an hour at the gym doing circuit training but this dvd is still more of a workout in just 20 min than that whole hour I spend at the gym! I probably sweat more in those 20 min also than an hour at the gym. It's very intense and I'm in pretty good shape already. I've been working out for a while now and been running for a couple of years. I would recommend this to ANYONE! Everyone can do this whether it's the modified version or not. I am usually sore the next day or two after and am always shaky after I get done and I'm only on level 1. I'm kind of scared to get to level 2! If this doesn't help me tone up, then nothing will! Of course you have to eat right along with this. 70% diet 30% exercise! I love Jillian unlike a lot of people because she reminds me of myself. She's tough and no mercy! I hope to become a trainer one day and I think I may end up following in her footsteps somewhat :)
0399226907|5.0|I  remember this book from my 3rd grade class,Im a sophmore in high school. This and \\"Brown bear, Brown Bear\\" are the only books i ever read (like a hundred times each)i remeber this was my favorite book. i recommend this book because i guarantee your child WILL remeber it.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This app works fine. I font know what everybodys deal is...? It works fine on my kindle and its pretty fun.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If only there were 10+ stars to rate this book! I loved, loved, loved all three books and was sad to finish the last words of Fifty Shades Freed.  I literally read all three books in less than a week.  This last book sums up Ana's and Christian's relationship so nicely.  My only question is...When does the movie come out?  And...Who will play Christian and Ana?  I am recommending this series to everyone and anyone I know.  Big kudos to EL James for creating such amazing characters and with such imagination transforming their relationship in such a way that you feel it's right before your eyes.  I've said it before but will say it again...\\"Where can I find Mr. Grey?!\\" This books begs this questions especially for the single gals out there.  Mr. Grey is ever so passionate, intense and makes one wonder if there are any men out there like him.  Hmm...I can safely say not in NYC.<br /><br />If you want a book to read and keep your attention for hours on end then read this series.  I can safely say you will NOT regret reading it, well only when you're done.  I for one, started re-reading the series again.  Without spoiling the ending, what I loved most is the how the author incorporated Christian's perspective on what he thought of Ana from the day he met her.  It was a pleasant surprise and a great way to end the book.  Bravo to you Ms. James and thank you for these books!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|As many are saying here this app is having a problem with FCs when you get a few combos completed.  Now whenever I try to combine elements that do not work I get an FC on my DX.<br /><br />***UPDATE - it looks like they came out with an update for the FCs.  It did fix the FCs but the game now gets very bogged down and slow when play for a few minutes.  I turned off all sounds and that seemed to pretty much fix that issue.
B005723JSQ|2.0|Not what I expected from Sophie Kinsella.  I anxiously awaited this book to be delivered to my Kindle and felt like the story dragged on and on. This isn't your typical witty, good humored, page-turner Sophie kind of book.  If someone could lend it to you then I say good for it but don't waste your money on it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Impressive show as a literary work?  Not quite.  Good summer beach read?  Absolutely.  I'm not a fan of erotica or romance novels, but for some reason this book peaked my interest and kept me entertained.  As with Twilight, I'm a bit embarrassed about how much I enjoyed the books, because they are poorly written.  But the character development was perfect for me.  I enjoyed the conversations and emotions between the two main characters and honestly believed their relationship to be true...for both books.<br /><br />A good book to me is one that has me living in it's world, or wishing I did, and when it's over I mourn the characters.  And Fifty Shades did that too me.  How? I have no idea, but it did.  It's similar to eating a healthy, organic delicious meal everyday of your life and then caving in and hitting up the McDonald's drive thru.  Your appetite is sated, you feel wonderful in the moment and when you drive away you think, \\"Hey, I should come here more often, that was delicious.\\"  But you never want to tell anyone you went there (much less enjoyed it) and after a few days can't even remember why you did in the first place.  And it's months before you actually do ever go back.<br /><br />My number one issue with the book are the bloody British references.  I love British jargon and banter, but not so much when it's coming out of the mouths of born and bread American characters. It was distracting, like a book full of errors, and took away from the story.<br /><br />By the end of the book I was skimming over the sex scenes because how many times can two people do it, really?  I was exhausted by it.  If I ever read \\"oh my\\" again it will be too soon.<br /><br />But the relationship between Ana and Christian was solid.  Totally believable and enjoyable.  Read this book if it was recommended to you.  Read this book if you are curious about it.  Read this book if you like hot erotica.  And read this book if you are looking for an easy, quick relationship themed story that will make you smile, race your heart, and warm your...well you know.  Oh my....
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this wonderful movie! It is very interesting, has beautiful visuals effects and is quite unique.

B004J1DBJI|3.0|I am disappointed that I cannot get Wolfram Alpha to download on my HTC Droid Thunderbolt.  When/if I do get it to download my rating will go up. (presuming that the app works in all other respects)  Untilled then you will have to have my 3star rating.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|I saw this app on the free app of the day, and I usually get them no matter what because they're free so incantation just keep it on my cloud. I hit downloadon this app then I swathe three stars. Uh oh, I thought, what's wrong with this app. So I read the reviews and it said itwas big, hard to use, took to long to load cities, the list goes on and on. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised at this app. it was quick, fast to load apps, and VERY pretty. the only bad thing is, it is a bit big, but besides that I'm very happy
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|hey guys this really a good thing to use if u want to dee what the weather is like. this is a really a good why to be in a good mood or a bad day because of your weather and this app so you need to get and its free but u will really like it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was expecting a novel the first time I tried reading it.  So when it abruptly jumped to the other side of the world with none of the same characters I got lost and put it down.  My expectations were wrong, it's not a novel, it's a history book, an oral history book.  It's a collections of individual stories by a group of very diverse people, that when put together tell the global story of the war. I changed my expectations, and tried again.  It turned out to be an amazing, really fun read.  I like to every once in a while reread some of the stories, like the battle of Yonkers, clearing the sewers in Paris, the AWOL Chinese Sub, or the downed pilot.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Its that it constantly force closes after you find your stride and really start to enjoy the game. Just as you think to yourself, &quot;This is fun and intuitive in a weird kind way. I could play this fo-&quot; and then FORCE CLOSE! Such a waste of an otherwise great game.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|the update fixed the force close error. great game, very much like alchemy. same combos as alchemy as well. there is a 20.word minimum
0316067598|5.0|An amazing read, I couldn't put it down once I picked it up.  Upon further research, the author was a little loose with some facts, i.e. the number of enemy forces.  But overall it was an amazing story, no wonder Peter Berg is producing a big budget movie based on it.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, I think it's definatly worth adding to my blu ray collection. I found myself laughing and being entertained by all the charecters, its very aestetically pleasing.  Owen Wilson is lovable in this.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|Delightful.  Loved reading about all the experiences of the vet in his early days.characters are memorable and like the humor.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|awesome app! great graphic, great accuracy! recommend for everyone to download this app on free day of it. rate it five stars and six stars if i could.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Got this apply because I thought it had a live background as it has on my Apple iTouch, but this Android app doesn't have that feature. Really disappointed that features was not included!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This is a really fun game but sadly it keeps crashing. Its unplayable. I hope they fix it. Its about matching two things to help you advance. Like you pick water and earth and that will give you a new element to play with. As I mentioned. the game crashes for me about a halo hour into the game and no ammount of reloading will make it work. I'm using it on the Kindle Fire.
B005Z271Y6|2.0|One of the worst, most painful things to watch. I bought this for my wife and I to see Adele. We were able to hear Adele, and that is great, but the video is horrible. As one reviewer (Kit) wrote \\"...the director used every trick in the book\\". And he used it over and over again! Out-of-focus to focused, and back out again, quick cutting, panning, zooming, over and over. It never stopped. If the songs were uptempo, the editing / cutting got more frenetic.<br />The longest held shot was for about 2 seconds on her face... maybe. It was terrible, and a repulsive disservice to Adele who deserves better... much better.<br /><br />How does viewing a blurry ceiling lighting fixture enhance my 'concert experience'? I bought this so that I could see an Adele performance, not a director's performance. Why only show Adele one out of 20 shots? The credits show a list of maybe 20 camera operators. They needed 3, and one should have stayed fixed, and on Adele, full body shot, the entire time.<br /><br />This 'director' and 'producer' should be sent to prison for this crime.<br /><br />The problem is that the director kept calling attention to himself instead of Adele. I bought this to see Adele, not the director.<br /><br />Adele, Darling, please get yourself some competent people behind you, not a bunch of imature, amateur MTV hacks with ADHD. You deserve much better.<br /><br />All that aside, the sound is very good. DTS-HD Master. Beautiful. So close your eyes and listen. She's a wonderful, heartfelt performer and the video is appauling.

B0073ODRKG|2.0|This very set makes me thank the high heavens that Madonna left Warner Bros.  From the very tacky, uninspired cover all the way down to the CD's themselves, this set has zero to no appeal to any longtime Madonna fan.<br /><br />With that said, this set is not the complete studio set as it is missing Madonna's 1990 studio album I'm Breathless, containing one of the biggest worldwide hits of her career, Vogue.  Some will argue that this is a soundtrack release but ultimately only includes four songs from Dick Tracy while the rest were inspired by the Breathless Mahoney character.  How can you have a \\"Complete Studio Albums\\" box-set and leave out an album that contains, arguably, the biggest hit of her career?  That's not the only hit that's missing for you casual fans that are considering this purchase.<br />You will also not get:<br />Justify My Love<br />Into The Groove<br />Who's That Girl<br />Causing a Commotion<br />You Must Love Me<br />I'll Remember<br />This Used To Be My Playground<br />amongst many more glaring hits.<br /><br />I am aware that many of these songs mentioned were soundtrack songs or greatest hits songs, etc, but this goes to show that Warner had an opportunity to include a bonus disc or an extra DVD/Blu-Ray for that matter to make this a complete collection.  I know that's asking for too much here so I am going to pull back and just discuss what IS included.<br /><br />So what you do get are 11 Madonna albums in their original form except her first three albums.  The first three Madonna albums, Madonna, Like A Virgin and True Blue went through a remastering process in 2000 which was impeccable from a sound perspective.  As part of the remaster process, bonus tracks were added to all three albums along with artwork that was reminiscent of the original vinyl version of these albums.  All of these components came together to give us Madonna fans a reason to go back out and buy an album we already had.  Those three remastered versions are part of this collection. The remaining eight albums are untouched and in their original form.  Like A Prayer, Erotica and Bedtime Stories are in desperate need of a remaster, while Ray of Light could use some freshening up as well.<br /><br />Please be advised that these CD's DO NOT come with their booklets or in standard CD jewel cases but are actually housed in card sleeves which WB/Rhino is using as an opportunity to sell as a collector's item.  This is not a value as far as I am concerned.  Most of these physical CD's can be purchased at any used record store for under $5.  I see American Life and Bedtime Stories in the dollar bin at my local record store quite often.<br /><br />Honestly, WB/Rhino, I am feeling \\"love spent.\\"  Why do you keep putting out sub-par Madonna product?  We want to buy quality Madonna material.  Most of us fans have all these albums and not only that but we've managed (no thanks to you WB!) to get our hands on all the rare stuff too, including the b-sides, the unreleased material, the unreleased remixes, the unreleased instrumentals.  Why can't you package what we really want?  You're in it to make money and we're in it to shell out money BUT we're not a bunch of idiots who are going to run around and buy everything that comes out with the name \\"Madonna\\" plastered on it.  We want quality!<br /><br />Lets not focus on the missed opportunity for a second. Forget the unreleased material because god forbid someone, somewhere has to do a little bit of work and dig or get some papers signed (or whatever it takes to get rare material released) so that a dying record label can make some more money.<br />For this very release, I think every single Madonna fan would have run out and bought this set in the exact physical form you are offering with minimal complaints IF you had only remastered ALL 11 albums.  Major missed opportunity.<br /><br />***************Update*********August 2012**************<br /><br />So my original review above from a few monthsago was based on the Amazon price of $80 or so.<br />Today the price sits at $39.99.  It's not a bad value anymore. That's $3.63 an album.  I still stand behind my review above about the overall bad quality of this product but it doesn't make me as angry when the price actually reflects the quality.  This could be a great gift for a newbie fan.ago was based on the Amazon price of $80 or so.<br />Today the price sits at $39.99.  It's not a bad value anymore. That's $3.63 an album.

B004XXIHS2|5.0|This story was written the year I was born so it really interested me.  Also, I love the movie version with Robert Wagner.  This book was way better than the movie! There is nothing more exciting than an evil sociopath. I loved it!!

B004T2QZL8|3.0|I downloaded this really fun and addictive game for free. When I started playing it I found that it was hard to stop. Then after making about 50 different combinations the game forced me to shut down, and I couldnt play again without it shutting down every time I went to make another combination. Too bad...wouldve given this 5 stars otherwise.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|As previously stated, upping my rating to 5 stars now that the force close issue is resolved - this is a great game, and I'm having a lot of fun with it! Already thinking about picking up their other 2 Doodle games!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|This is a great app and you should download it, no question. The only problem is... after about 30 combinations or so, any combination you try that doesn't work will force close the app. I would be willing to pay for this app if that can be fixed. Thanks in advance.

0393330435|4.0|iWoz was an interesting read, although at times difficult to get through. In terms of compelling storytelling, there is no comparison to the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson. iWoz is a series of 'I did this, then I did this, followed by this and then this happened' stories told from the perspective of Steve Wozniak. As a result, the first part of the book takes a bit of patience to get through, but once you do there are some interesting tidbits inside.<br /><br />A few things I learned from this book that I never knew, although I probably should have known as a self-professed geek:<br />1) Woz invented the first computer (Apple 1) that we would recognize as a modern PC. That is to say, a box filled with electronics which you plug a monitor and keyboard into. All previous computers were boxes with LEDs and switches on the front (see: Altair 8800). I knew he invented the Apple I, I just didn't know it was the first to come with ability to plug in monitor & keyboard for input & display.<br />2) Woz invented the first programmable universal remote.<br /><br />Apart from that, there are some interesting stories about his time at Apple and what the culture was like there and at HP where he worked. All said, it's an interesting read if you are at all curious about computer history and are willing to work your way through the first portion of the book.

1441866868|3.0|Paolo Bacigalupi won a lot of acclaim and awards for his novel \\"The Windup Girl\\" when it came out in 2009.  The story's expansion of current trends in agriculture, business, and science make for frightening realism.  The sad stupidity and greed that drives many of the characters is also so common that it is scary to think we may never learn our lessons and let history keep repeating itself.  The complex plot, multiple characters, and intensely detailed setting add to the sense of seriousness and keep you pressing forward.<br /><br />In any novel these would be excellent qualities but in an audio book they can be difficult at best.<br /><br />While voice actor Jonathan Davis does an OK job he has some difficulties that make it hard for the listener to fully grasp the complexity of \\"The Windup Girl.\\"  The breaks between viewpoint transitions are a touch too short resulting in about a minute of listening to get that we have moved on in the story.  In the written form these can be signaled with extra line breaks, characters between sections, or even font changes; none of that works for the audio version.  Davis' voices also do not have consistency for characters, sometimes a reoccurring male has a different accent or speaks in a slightly different way; his female voices are almost identical and thus you can really only tell them apart when a name is used or the context makes it clear.<br /><br />\\"The Windup Girl\\" would be an intriguing read, a great choice to generate discussion, but as an audio book I found it frustrating.

B003UYUQZW|5.0|This movie is about a magical sand dagger that can send its possesser a few seconds into the past. That person can change the event that just occurred and only that person can see the time travel.  It had romance, action, and humor. I really enoyed this movie.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|adicting but not time consuming. u can start right up and after a few days you cant help but check on it
B005NKGEP2|1.0|Recipe:<br /><br />1. Combine 20-page poorly written walking tours of romantic European cities like Lux, Paris and London with<br /><br />2.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game you can play more than one game there are cool games a bad games but this game is very fun
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this game is really cool!!!!! there is so much to do- elements and creating them. it works perfectly on my kindle fire!!!!!!!!! thank you amazon
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Doodle God is the originalnal game That I saw on Kong many many years ago. Still the game is still awesome!!!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I really enjoy this app.  It is very realistic, the flipper buttons work well.  I have even hooked up my Goal Zero speakers to my kindle and the sound is like a real live Pinball machine (my wife doesn't like that).  Ron
B004T2QZL8|2.0|It was great fun. Until it began to crash. It's an update comes out that fix the crashing issue, I'm a download it again. Until then, I do not like it.<br /> Please, please, please, fix your product here.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved this game and wish it would have been possible not to cheat but it's impossible to experiment because of the force close problems...I'm on a kindle fire...but I want to see this issue fixed because its really a great game
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|The animations of this app are completely amazing and look great on my Galaxy Notes HD screen. But I don't plan on keeping a link on my homescreen just for the animations. If you made several widgets available like Beautiful Widgets has, you would have one killer app.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|Simply a trailer, you should be truthful and state you get the trailer for free, You can get that anywhere. I heard the movie is great but the con job of a free movie is no stars.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|did not like this at all nothing for guam and was hard to figure out i wanted to like it since i love hd apps so much but this app was just not for me .....
B004T2QZL8|3.0|is better but thievish ok so I rate about 3stars not<br />5 because it's name is a copy of pocket God?!!!!!!!!!!
B0016OOS16|4.0|I have been a CAD Drafter for over twelve years. I learned to draft on AutoCAD 14 and decided it was time to freshen up my skills. I have been getting great use out of this product working with 3D parts in Solidworks 2012. I have played the games that come on the disk and love the fly around the globe and space using Google Earth. I can see this product aiding me as I start to delve into other BIM programs. The construction feels rock solid in my hand and the design is working well thus far.

B004T2QZL8|3.0|This is a fun game but it keeps force closing on me. Please fix this problem so I can continue enjoying this game.
B005CKPQHA|5.0|Breaking Bad is nothing short of amazing!  From the Pilot to the last episode, simply the best show / movie I have EVER seen!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|the game itself was interesting to start but then it just started to have force close issues (droid Bionic). Fix those and it might get more stars, I just wasn't able to play that far to really get a feel for the game.<br /><br />Edit 3-22-12<br /><br />The cries for the force close issues were heard loud and clear. The game has been fixed for at least the Droid Bionic. It is a fun game that can get you wrapped up for a bit. Its one of the types of games that you can play a few minutes, go do what you need to do, and then come back and play a little more.
B0055S348W|5.0|i  just hooked this up to my printer and was able to print pictures, text, documents, etc... worked flawless... keep up the work.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Was fun till it stopped working.  If it was fixed I would play it again, but it had to get fixed.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|good at doing what its supposed to, however I was under the impression that this was an on-screen app and that a widget was applied however no widget I can't see it directly from my screen. please fix! I am very disappointed that this isn't just on-screen why bother having the time display if I can't view from my homescreen
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's a great app. I recently picked it up and it's great to know I have it where ever I go.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love the app, but every time I play a song or something, I have to for e close. it gets annoying.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|The app stopped moving  through the introduction pictures. I could still hear it talking. I was unable to leave until I did a soft reboot. When I was able to use the kindle again the app was not even listed. I thought that was odd. Glad I did not pay for it. Reminder to me to read reviews first.
0062060562|5.0|I could NOT put this book down.  That's all you need to know.  You will be hooked from the first page and be frantic to find out why the main character thinks she can't trust her own husband and yet doesn't know why.  She knows nothing more than what she writes in her journal each day before she goes to sleep and forgets everything she has learned.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was my first BDSM novel, and i wound up being pretty disappointed.  I kept reading, expecting it to get better, and it never did.  Sex scenes, including the BDSM scenes were blah, boring and uninteresting. And nobody comes instantly everytime they have sex, so that made it unrealistic. For being a book about dom/sub, there were only two scenes in the whole book and they were PG at best.<br /><br />The author uses the same adjectives, expressions, and descriptions over and over again. Also, a British author trying to write dialogue for an american college student did not work. Nobody talks that way. It was a very easy read, so I didnt have to waste too much of my life to read it.  Some people may like this book because it isnt very graphic, but I was hoping for something that would get my blood pumping.  This wasn't it.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Haven't been able to enjoy this app because it keeps force closing.  How frustrating!!! Seems to be fun, but I can't play it to tell.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It took me a awhile to begin reading this book. The story intrigued me, but it took me some time to begin reading it, finishing it just in time for the movie. Hopefully, Hollywood hasn't botched the story like they have with so many other great books.<br /><br />What I found interesting about The Hunger Games was the parallelism between American civilization of Panem to possibly our not too distant future. In the book, the breakdown of society has led to what can only be described as a totalitarian regime controlled by the Capitol. The Capitol keeps its citizens in check by forcing children from the ages of 12 to 18 years of age to battle to the death in a gladiator type event. Isn't this what Rome did with it's gladiator games before its civilization imploded?<br /><br />I teach American Government and History to high school students. What I found in the book were eerie similarities between the government of Panem and the governments of today's communist and radical Islamic regimes. These governments want 100% control, much like the Capitol has in the book.<br /><br />I thought this was a great read, and is a great way to teach our children what our world can become if we don't preserve freedom.<br /><br />Shaun F.

B004T2QZL8|3.0|The game is great and I love it but, it keeps force closing on me whenever I try to combine anything now. Please fix that! It is very annoying!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Very fun game until after you play it for a while and a &quot;force close&quot; message pops up. Hope somebody fixes it soon, I would love to finish it.
B00000DCHI|5.0|[[ASIN:B00000DCHI Billy Joel Greatest Hits: Vol. 1-2 (2CD)]]<br />I may be crazy! But.... I've been a BJ fan since I first saw him on a late 70s SNL Wow! Has it been that long  ago? I'm quoting the lyrics of one of my favorite tunes. \\"I remember you sitting there, alone in your electric chair; I told you dirty jokes until you smiled.\\" This greatest hits disc has all of my favorite BJ tunes. Even if you have two left feet, how can you resist the urge to dance to the beat of \\"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\\"? Just a great album. If you like the artist, you need this dynamite CD.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just finished day 4, and really like this workout. Although I am only on level 1, I feel it's helping my long distance running.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Super graphics, smooth operation until you get 15-20 elements then the only thing you can do with this app is to open it.  Try to go ant further and it force closes.<br /><br />Needs some developer attention on this slug app!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|the latest update deals with the force closing problem. however it still freezes from time to time. but at least it is playable at this point.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I was enjoying this game until the force closes started. The app worked great for 30 minutes or so. I am using my kindle fire. If the problem gets fixed I will change my rating to 5 stars.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this app basically stole the concept behind the alchemy app including the four basic elements and several of the combinations. only difference is that alchemy is free.
1451648537|5.0|I loved the Jobs biography. A truly great person, is not just great in their own right,<br />but rather, they elevate those around them to greatness, Steve did this. Only in America,<br />what a visionary, and motivator. Yes, I call him genius. Thank you

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do not hand out 5-star book reviews lightly, but this book struck me to the core.  (Usually I don't write a review at all)<br /><br />It begins with a short story that if it had been traditionally published, would surely have been showered with awards for Best Short Fiction.  It's followed by four books that start with that simple premise and expand it to an entire universe which is simple on the outside, but downright fractal in the amount of detail you just want to KNOW about the setting, the characters, and how life is lived in the setting.<br /><br />The basic premise in the original story starts with a society that due to an unexplained disaster has been confined to a 130-something story silo buried in the ground.  This silo contains an entire self-contained civilization that has been running for hundreds of years.  The highest crime in this place is to express a desire to go outside and explore the toxic wasteland that surrounds the silo.  The punishment for this offense (along with murder and other capital crimes) is exactly what they asked for: a trip outside.  But before the criminal's prompt demise due to the hyper-toxic conditions, they are tasked with cleaning the cameras that provide the silo's only view of the outside world.  Despite the fact that this is done in the middle of their death sentence, they invariably perform this task, and nobody there knows why.  (It'd be like asking somebody strapped to a lethal injection chair to please sign their tax forms with the arm not encumbered by an IV.)<br /><br />While Mr. Howey writes compelling characters, the real star of the story is the silo itself and the society it contains.  There have been many books written about space colonists or stranded people, but none to my memory that really ask tough questions about how such a cramped and wholly self-sufficient place might actually function; instead most books just use the colony as background filler for whatever recycled plot the author wants to use.  Well, now you can find out how such a place might work, because the silo is anything but background filler.<br /><br />One question I've always asked myself when reading a book about a space colony or other self-contained society: \\"Where's the toothbrush factory?\\"  Manufacturing a modern toothbrush takes a surprisingly large amount of specialized high-precision machinery that has absolutely no other use.  Making any volume of toothbrushes by hand is prohibitively time-consuming and any society goes through them in enough quantity that relying on established stocks indefinitely is not possible.  Well, with \\"Wool's\\" silo I can certainly imagine opening a door in that place and finding the toothbrush machines.  The setting feels that \\"right.\\"<br /><br />As anyone with an imagination not crippled by years of ADD-addled modern entertainment can guess, an entire mature society that fits wholly within a 130-ish floor building is just begging for a whole series of books on how such a place evolved, what happens inside, how it actually works, and what happens to the cramped denizens.<br /><br />I imagine if Mr. Howey ever decided to give up the series, he'd have legions of people begging to write other stories set in this universe, and I cannot wait to read the next installment.<br /><br />Postscript:  Unlike many self-published authors I have read on Amazon, this work has real polish; it is not rife with grammatical and spelling mistakes (correctly spelled, but incorrect, words are the bane of the self-published author), and the writing is clear and concise.  Too many self-publish authors fall into the trap of poor pacing and repetitive elements leaving you to think: \\"This could be a real gem, if only they had a good editor.\\"  Well, this book has no such problems.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I have read all the Percy Jackson books and loved each and every one of them. Mr. Riordan is a great author that I enjoy reading.
0553209450|5.0|So, of course, I wanted a copy of it!<br /><br />It arrived quickly, in good condition, and I really have no complaints about it - except that I had to go out and buy a box of tissues for the ending. :'(
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game is fun up until it just stops working.  It works fine until I hit a certain number of created items.  If I duplicate something I've already made I'm OK. But when I create something new, it crashes.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I like this app because you can now what you should wear to day.  You get to now what is going to be to day.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|The widget wasn't obvious. Must move from sd to phone. And without a background it's hard to read. Otherwise, this weather app looks awesome, has my city, and I'm keeping it! Thanks devs I'm happy with it!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|i got this game in the free app of the day and in the morning it was ok. then i got home from school and it said&quot; force close&quot; every time i tried to combine elements. so i tried to uninstall and reinstall it and now there is a problem with the download and i cant get it!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Fabulous game, force closes all the damn time. Some bug fixes and it should be a 4 star. s s d
B004T2QZL8|1.0|ok this game was AMAZING at first. i loved playing it and creating things. then it started force-closing, and i hate it. what a bunch of humbeefe.
B0070Z97LG|4.0|I think the movie was well done... great acting by everyone... and they kept me intrested in the story... I think its twist was cool and hasn't been overplay = a movie with such a twist hasn't been done since 'Sixth Sense' everything we see is so darn readable..... the only problem I had **************** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT STOP READING ******************* is during the end when the house caught fire... I thought the ghost of his wife should have done more to help her husband... by stopping the evil dude...Maybe slamming more doors. Trying to block the bad guy in the basement.... a few little ghostly things....would have made it more... I donno.... happening. But I think the movie is worth owning, if ur someone who doesn't buy DVD's what the hell do you do with your days every day of the year?? LOL... kidding...  if u don't own it Cable will eventually run it back to back all weekend like they do some films to the point of making us customers want to jump out the window....<br /><br />while we're at it, RENT or BUT the HAUNTING 1963 with Ms. Julie Harris you will love it...<br /><br />I think its smart to have our own movie collection because the chemericals are KILLING US... I can not handle those medical ads all day long.... I'd rather watch a movie without interuption from bladder control products, tampons, diebetes supplies, catherders, medications and the list of Complication they can cause ... and that hub around chair...! LOL!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing, I think anyone should read it! I HiGHLY reccomend it. It's really popular and has a movie coming out. I really enjoyed this book, and it is a real page turner. The ending, makes you want to buy the second book to see how Peeta and Katniss's relationship continues, does it fall apart? Or carry on?  Get this book, and I promise you won't regret. Also, at the end, get Catching Fire (the second book) then Mocking Jay (the third). This series is amazing.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it until I ran into the force closes like everyone else. They need to fix and update and it would be five stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this application.  it was the one thing that has gotten back on track to reading the Bible.  I love the in the cloud option with YouVersion online so it follows me on any device.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|fun game for the first 30 elements. then every move causes force close. would love to love it, but instead makes me want to throw my kindle fire at developers heads. try it but don't get too attached
B004T2QZL8|4.0|had to try it on my fire had the force close after 42 just got a update installed seems to have fixed the issue. we'll see let ya know later
B0056BMK6K|5.0|As clear a road map to expanding a writer's market as one could hope to find.  John Locke has blazed the trail for anyone who wants to utilize social media to reach countless people, and has invited all to follow in his footsteps.  This book makes it easy to do.  He is candid, direct, and honest.  A must read, particularly for an emerging writer who has limited ability to reach his/her potential market.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|This app does come with 3 widgets. You must go into manage applications and move it from your sd card to your internal memory for them to appear.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Wow! I love this app! It is amazing! It is really awesome! Coolest app ever! Everyone needs this app! Cool app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Greatest. Book. Ever.<br />Could not put this down, read all three books in this series in five days. Very gripping and intense. All three books were good but the first one is absolutely the best.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is great if you don't want to pay for music or download a funny video 2 show your friends!!!!!!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Then it said, force close ... so I retried it, and I couldn't even get to where I left off, because it force closed again. It says the best paid app worldwide! I'm finding that hard to believe. It should not force close every minute.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Rich detail and an intriguing story line.  These books are long but read quickly.  If you like kings, queens, and knights with just a touch of fantasy, you will love this book.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I got this on the free app of the day. If I knew how much by soon to be six year old daughter would love the game, I'd have paid full price. It's a good game to occupy her while we are out to eat waiting for our food to arrive. It's a game we can play together, taking turns. And she has to think. There's some puzzle solving involved so I don't feel guilty about her playing it. The hard part is getting her to put it down!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this game got good reviews so I gave it a try and I'm very disappointed! I got it on my kindle fire and I got about halfway through the game and it all of a sudden started to force close and I'm getting fed up so I deleted it because it isn't worth it. I do no recomend this game at all! do not waste your time on it or money buying it!
0307956350|3.0|I love spy books with twists and turns. There are actually only a few in this book, but the author manufactures some by going back and forth in time, leaving the reader, at times, a little lost, since some of the jumps go back to separate places and times than the other jumps, without much explanation.  In actual fact, this is the least exciting spy book I have read in a long time.  I forced myself to finish it but the end wasn't much worth it.  It's well-written, with a good female lead, but there's just not enough excitement in the book.
B005UG542S|5.0|The quality of movie and streaming was good. The best part it you can pause / start from any point you want. The only disadvantage is you have access for only 48 hrs from you first start to play the movie.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Fun game works ok on my rooted Evo3d running a custom rom. Played for about 15 minutes didn't have any crashes.
B0032FPVKE|4.0|This product is just like the product specification. It's handy and has enough space for standard cameras. But not at all recommended for SLR/DSLR. Those will not fit into it.
B001GCUO5W|2.0|I don't understand why this movie has received so many positive reviews. \\"Shutter Island\\" has the makings of a good thriller but never gets off the ground. The plot is good, the cast is great, and the cinematography is super cool. But everything else is just downright stupid: not scary, not creepy, and super obvious. I felt like Scorsese was dumbing down to his audience the whole time. The trailers for this film were much better than the actual movie. Skip this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After hearing all the talk about the Hunger Games, I was thinking, okay here comes another Twilight, made for teenagers with a catchy romance and some action.  Numerous times I heard, \\"You've got to read the Hunger Games.\\"  Finally, hearing my cousin, who hasn't read a book since he got out of college, say HE couldn't put them down, I was curious.  So, curiosity got the best of me and I started reading.  This book got me from the get go.  It has some bigger themes at play for those who really want to get into it.  Now, I'm almost done with the second book.. the first one got me hooked and I'll be definitely reading the whole series.  I honestly couldn't put it down.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I llllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this game it is awesome. best game. so addictive me &amp;my friends love it ilove the different names. like peanut
B000001FRY|3.0|Boy got the U2 classic I WILL FOLLOW, but seriously...The U2 menbers were really young and without the chops they will get in the next years...Some songs are soooooo naive that embarasses me...Well, the U2 menbers were BOYS by the time they recorded BOY...
B00785P2QC|4.0|I have played this game for hours and I have already found out that you don't have to buy money or invest packs to progress through the game. the posting on facebook allows you to get a single invest point which helps to buy other items most likely the expansion slots.<br />I highly recommend this game to anyone
B000001EAQ|5.0|Besides the album title POP?!? this is one of the best from U2... MOFO, STARING AT THE SUN, GONE, LAST NIGHT ON EARTH, DISCOTHEQUE and DO YOU FEEL LOVED are U2 classic songs!!! The rest of the album are cool too...Don't be confused by the title POP and the critics, this is one great trip...
B004SOR4H6|5.0|i think if you don't have a twitter you need get one. most people say Facebook is the best social network its not twitter is
B002J8LVO0|5.0|UNFORGETTABLE FIRE got some ALL TIME BEST U2 songs like PRIDE, SORT OF HOMECOMING,BAD and the title track...This is a transition point in the U2 career...You can hear the raw rock of the first 3 albuns, but also the atmospheric keyboards from future classics like JOSHUA TREE and ACHTUNG BABY.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so much fun and gives you so many choices to play. my daughter and I have a blast competing against each other
B001NB52PS|4.0|This must be the rawest U2 album...In my opinion, it´s from WAR that U2 really start to create solid songs...in the first 2 records, the band is very young and BONO wasn´t the GREAT vocalist he will become...the EDGE too...WAR got some U2 ALL time classics NEW YEAR´S DAY, SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY and Two hearts beat as one...Really like WAR, but U2 still will become a ROCK LEGEND after this...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are great! So much fun to be had. Mu bathroom time has tripled, no more multiple trips! I am going right now and having a great go at it!
B000002KIE|5.0|NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS is not only a great punk rock album, but part of the World history!!! Ramones registrated the PUNK thing, but SEX PISTOLS registrated the dirty punk totally against society attitude! There´s no space for love songs or even a respectable verse here...IT´s ABSOLUTELY PUNK!!! TOTAL ANARCHISM...It´s so against it all that it´s the ONLY album ever recorded by SEX PISTOLS...PUNK GEMS like PROBLEMS, BODIES, GOD SAVE THE QUEEN, ANARCHY, NO FEELINGS and LIAR are incredibly raw and some lyrics are ABSURD!!!!WELL DONE, SEX PISTOLS!!!! You guys really are PUNKS...Amazes me the fact that this is the ONLY SEX PISTOLS album, and they are COMPLETE WORLD LEGENDS!!!WELL DONE, MANNNN!!!!
0439023521|2.0|This book has an exciting start.  The story leading up to the hunger games had me reading with excitement.  Unfortunately, during the games I became less and less interested in the characters.  Peetra is so one-dimensional that I can't imagine anyone rooting for him.  Then there is a tortuously long segment where the two are stuck in a cave and really everyone knows what is happening by this point, so there is no momentum and you almost throw the book away.  I managed to finish it, but it never gets any better.  By the end I was disappointed that a great idea had been wasted, along with my weekend.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Crashes. Only got 30 discoveries in and nnow it crashes when ever an item is combined. it was fun while it lasted.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game. Fun and addicting. I love the fact that all of the games are challenging yet entertaining. Love it
B003L77GGA|4.0|Clark Kent faces his final challenge to finally become the Man of Steel in Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season. Clark Kent (Tom Welling) has come along way since his teenage years in Smallville High, and after years of struggling with the transition from boyhood to adulthood and forging his superhero identity, he is ready to jump into the spotlight as Earth's greatest protector. Unfortunately, a mysterious dark force has arisen, corrupting the minds of the populace and putting Clark and other superheroes in danger. With the help of Lois Lane (Erica Durance), Supergirl (Laura Vandervoort), the Justice League and his adoptive father Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), Clark will find the strength to overcome the darkness and embrace his fate. Smallville is the popular live-action comic book series that follows the adventures of a young Clark Kent during the years before he becomes Superman. The tenth and final season is somewhat uneven, but still offers a satisfying finale to one of the longest running television series. The final season also marks the return of many popular characters including arch nemesis Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) and amusing appearances of other DC characters.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray edition of Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season won't be the highlight of your Blu-Ray collection, but fans of Smallville will be pleasantly pleased with its presentation and content. All 22 episodes of the final season are presented in 1.78 widescreen format. The picture quality surpasses those of previous high definition \\"Smallville\\" releases with its bright colors and solid contrast. Its DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track is quite excellent among television box sets.

B005GSY23M|4.0|They went back and picked out the key elements of the 80's and made music for today!  If you liked the Knight Rider feel or even if you don't, this is your soundtrack! I have my 5 favorite songs!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Awesome logic game that really makes you think. Some puzzles are more challenging than others. I've currently beat all the levels with three stars and just downloaded Cut The Rope Experiments. So fun!! Also, if you pull the rope on the main page, it can take you to a youtube short featuring Om Nom. Gotta love it when he screams! Lol!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I love the game but every tome I try to mix to elements and they don't mix I get a messenger and have to force close the game. don't get me wrong I love the game but fix the force closes it bugs me I got 30 minutes of playing beforebit started the force closes. fix it soon
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Fabulous. If you're a fan of Myst, you'll love this app. You change the seasons to solve various puzzles. Totally worth the price.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I love it but after 32 combinations it forces closes on every single combo I tried. so disappointed. please fix!
B004FOA84A|5.0|I'm a big fan of room escape games, so I absolutely loved this one. Go to various places inside or outside the manor to solve the mystery of where grandpa went. Really fun.
B007M6P01O|5.0|The mess hit the fan at the farm. Rick and his group found out the hard way about making noise and what that brings to the dinner table. They should have known from their experiences in Atlanta and up in the mountains what happens when they make alot of noise. The walkers encountered recently in the area (espeically since Dale was killed by one in the perimeter) should have alerted them that this was not a good time to be walking around at night.<br /><br />With that said though, the last episode where Shane had created a problem for the group to have to solve i.e. Randall loose in the woods with a weapon had to be dealt with. If Randall had gotten away, he could have led his group to the farm, and there would be more problems than just dealing with a random walker to contend with. The turning of Shane into an insane person might not be indicative of the disease. It may just be that he snapped dealing with having to kill Otis to get out of the school yard, and his situation with Lori. Lori didn't help matters at all when she told Shane that the baby might be his. Her wishy washy back and forth mindgames with Shane drove him over the edge. In Shane's mind, killing Rick might get him Lori back, and he could finally have the family he wanted.<br /><br />Now, back to this show.. The defensive perimeter of the farm was very untenable. The group was right to have broken contact and abandoned the location. That is not to say that they can never go back and retrieve things in the future though. The fire idea was not working out when Rick led the walkers into the barn in an attempt to burn them out. They likely would have burned to death or been eaten had the camper not pulled up next to the barn window. I am not sure why the driver just didn't pull out once Karl and Rick were on board, but hey, it was confusing at that point, and the boy was only 17 that was driving.<br /><br />The female sword player in the woods was an interesting figure. You can tell it was a female by the body movement, even though the face was covered by a hood. the two chained walkers behind her was interesting, because they didn't appear to want to eat the person they were chained to. The two armless walkers just stood there like pets. Intriguing. Also, the torso of the swordsperson appears to be walker-like. Andrea was saved by the swordsperson at the last moment before she likely would have been killed. The fact that Andrea has the gun bag and ammunition is going to be a problem for the group in the future.<br /><br />The group has been questioning Rick's decisions in this episode. The only person who is 100 percent behind Rick is Hershel. This makes twice that Rick has saved Hershel's life. The first time was at the bar, and the second was during the shootout at the farm with the walkers. Rick finally takes the gloves off and digs straight into the people who are questioning him. He tells them that he had to kill Shane to protect the group. He also finally tells them about how the walkers can turn without being bitten. The disease has already infected everyone in the group. It is unknown if a person can turn at any time, or if they have to die first. Currently, a person has to die before they can turn. This might not always be the case though.<br /><br />The baby that Lori is carrying may likely be the first person born that would be immune to the disease. Just like the black plague in the 1300s where those that survived were immune to the \\"black death\\", and passed those immunities on to their offspring, this too will likely be the black death plague of this millenia. The look that Lori gave Rick when he told her that he had to kill Shane was very odd. It was almost like she was still in love with Shane, and was buying into Shane's b.s. of Rick not being able to protect her, Karl, and the baby and was secretly hoping Rick would die so she and Shane could be together.<br /><br />I still believe though that the group of men Randall was with is led my Darryl'sbrother Merle. I do not think we have seen the last of Merle yet. The fact that Darryl is so central to the plot makes me think that in the future, Darryl may become the lynchpin in a serious plot.<br /><br />Rick has started to go down the path that Shane did. I see in Rick's eyes that he may be starting to lose his mind. Is this the first stage before turning? becoming insane? Randall gave off the same vibe too. Remember when Randall at the public works went crazy on the walker on the ground? He was flat out nuts at that moment.<br /><br />Now, on to the endgame. Rick lays down the law. Orders whomever wants to leave, to get out of the group and try it out on their own. There were no takers. The view over the woods of the prison in the background could be the fortress Rick has been looking for. If they can get into that Prison, their security is ensured. But, remember... a prison is never empty. Those that are in the cells before the outbreak, will likely still be in them now. They would have had no food. Likely, they would have died in their cells and turned. So, this place should be crawling with walkers. Also, there are guns and ammunition in all prisons. This could be the ticket they need for their security. Prisons have generators, fuel, vehicles, food and clothing. Everything the group needs to survive.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the next season! Thanks for reading what I had to share with everyone.
0439023521|5.0|Really liked this book. Great plot. Never would have expected a \\"teen\\" fiction to be this good. I'm excited to see how the next one unfolds.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is above and beyond what anyone can expect from it. It is a camp knife, kitchen knife, pry bar, filet knife, skinning knife and anything else you need it to be. The only things I can find negative about this knife are the uneven factory grind, which is an anomaly, so no fault to KA-BAR or Ethan Becker there, it'll happen to knives once in a while. The other thing I'm not ecstatic about is the sheath, if you unsnap the retention snaps without unsheathing the knife it will try and do a flip, but this issue is remedied with a simple nylon webbing and ABS clip leg strap, which is part of the way I carry the knife in a drop leg position.<br /><br />On a related note, I like the way it hangs without any modifications, but I personally like the drop leg position, so I went ahead and attached a 2\\" ABS clip to the belt loop, and on the other side of the ABS clip I attached a 2\\" wide velcro strap, it works nicely.<br /><br />The only warning I have about this knife is it's very thick, 1/4 to be exact, so be very careful with the chopping, don't hit your thumb.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I've never played a game like this before but Doodle God is absolutely terrific! It's fun and addicting and a great game for everyone!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Would have been good, but the random crashes make it unplayable after you get to about 40 out of 248 elements. And you can repeat already discovered elements. Hard not to do once you get to...well 40, since that's as far as the bug allows you to go.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|you must get this game because it is awesome. but make sure you get the kindle edition.get this game now.
1599219751|5.0|This story is amazing and captivating.  Great story about a group of men who escape from a prison in Siberia only to meet with great hardship as they cross the mountains then dessert. If you read it you'll love it too!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|this game would be super awesome but it keeps force closing. you cant actually ever play longer then 3 seconds at a time.this would have been a 5 star. don't get cause you cant play.

B004T2QZL8|1.0|forces self closed a lot please fix I enjoy the game until it shuts self off . please update and fix
B004WCTLNY|5.0|An excellent Philip K. Dick adaptation that comes off as neither too cerebral nor too wantonly action-heavy. Matt Damon slides into the role of a brash, combustible young politician in the mold of JFK, whose chance meeting with his dream girl sets off a chain reaction that alters his perception of the world at large. Shortly afterwards he stumbles across the delegates of a shadow agency, who freeze time and bend reality to tinker with the thoughts and feelings of the population, all in the name of a precise global timeline. Damon, naturally, is immune to their tricks and bolts from the scene. As a science fiction twist on the cat and mouse game, it's a blast of fresh air with an admirable sense of restraint. In a perfect world these agents would do their jobs without being noticed at all, so their methods consist of a series of slick, downplayed visual tricks and slight tweaks to the natural order. That sensibility works for their own purposes, but also for the film's: the special effects are equally moderate, and as a result more believable. Damon and Emily Blunt click right away as a duo, so well in fact that it's no challenge at all to root for them from the get-go, and the agency itself is far from the black-and-white, good-versus-evil gang of naughty henchmen you might expect. A tense, creative adventure with perhaps a tad too much sentimentality, it's a raging, surprising, success.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I loved both Sherlock Holmes movies, but was disappointed by the lack of extras in the first movie (only had 1)... I would love more cast/crew interviews, making of movie, voice over on movies, etc.<br /><br />I would pay more for that DVD :)
0446530573|5.0|Awesome. Huge Sopranos fan; love the cast pictures and series information tidbits as well as the great simple & healthy recipes.  Extremely speedy delivery. Would purchase from this seller again. Great price.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this is such a great game. Nothing like I expected. Doodle God is truly a MAGNIFICANT GAME THAT I LOVE.
B0059XTUB8|1.0|Why would anyone want to read such a bad book that is based on a fake story? If you want to read a good book, look somewhere else...
B004T2QZL8|3.0|please fix the force close issue, otherwise a great game,but definiteley aggravated if you can not play due to crash.please fix as soon as possible so.that we can enjoy the game

Especially since the game tells you to check out the extras then you get there and it says coming soon
B004T2QZL8|1.0|The app is great execpt when you play your 10-20 minutes then the app force closes and then is a complete waste of time and money until they fix this issue this app is a do not download!!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|great game and to all the people that said they couldint play it after like 28 levels just keep playing it intillb your past that after that you can open it when ever
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is what tipped me over from Iphone to android!  It is extremely simple and easy to use!  I tried frustratingly with a jailbroken Iphone to do what this app does, and never got the Iphone to match this app!<br /><br />It let's you choose the resolution when you want to download and preserves the names of the vids also!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I am now at the point where any new combo is met with a fc. 34 items and 10 groups on a kindle fire.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|What a great game this could be if it wouldn't force close every time I try to make a match. I got to about 50 matches now I can't make any more. I hope they fix this. Maybe there other doodle games work better. I would gladly pay for this app if it worked correctly. I recommend you don't try this game because its extremely addictive and frustrating when you can't play it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had just finished read the last book in the triology and the whole series kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen next...there were so many twists in the series, it kept me going to where I couldn't put it down.  I recommend this series for you to read and enjoy.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|the idea is fun...like alchemy, but the freezing makes it totally unplayable<br />fix please! then maybe I'll change my rating to reflect on the game, not the issues
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This seems like an amazing game.  I played Doodle God for 15 minutes and now it force closes every time i attempt to combine a fern with the mushroom.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|This movie was also known as Mad Max 2. The picture alone on this Blu-ray was excellent! This will replace my original DVD of this movie, not only for the clear Hi Def picture but also for the sound. A must have for your Mad Max collection!!!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|force closes after 28 ele. this is really frustrating! please fix as soon as posiable. it was a fun game till then.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is amazing! I cant believe all the stations available! If you put in a \\"Christian\\" search it comes up with shows from Joyce Meyer and all the greats! Thanks for such a great radio app!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|fun game until i got to 40 combs.  now it just force closes. Samsung galaxy note running gingerbread.  please fix bug.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|FORCE CLOSE AFTER ABOUT 30 COMBINATION.CAN NOT PLAY AT ALL . LOOKS LUKE A GOOD GAME IF IT WOULD WORK
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee's story it a painful reminder that the cruelty of man is outweighed only by his ignorance of his fellow man's suffering.  She is a brave woman, and an exceptionally strong person. It saddens me to know she had to endure so many terrible things at the hands of that appalling man.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|it started out awesome and its really fun but it freaking force closes every time I combine elements now! Gnex
B001E45XT4|2.0|I am a tiny woman and just me pulling it out of the package snapped the plastic that slides in and out to extend the size of the headphones.  They're also a bit too tight, even expanded on my head.  The microphone sounds good but it's also poorly built.<br /><br />I think at $25 they're crappy quality so I feel sorry for those who spent more.<br /><br />Not sure why they've got such good reviews.<br /><br />Returned for refund so I could get a better pair.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|After downloading I read some reviews to find out whats was the problem with Force-close, and it say it was fix with the new version. I have now the 1.4.2.4 new version and still have the same issue with force-close. I'm using a Samsung Skyrocket II. I will be happy to give a 5 star to the app, but this error keeps me from doing it so. For all else its fun up to the point where it do the Force-Close.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|However, I am also getting force close issues, mainly when i use energy. Everything else though is great, i like the interface. Amazon should keep up with the Google Play Store and update immediately. DROID RAZR.
B002JVWRAO|3.0|The disc's were good but the plastic case to store the dvd's in was broken making it unable to store the dvd's in.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like that you and listen to it. if you want to read. it a must have for ever kindle user .
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I love the game I got 46 elements but now all it does is keep force closing which is so upsetting! please fix it soon!!
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Really challenges your thinking... awesome read. I'd recommend it to anyone trying to go further in life and motivate themselves.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Game is interesting at first, but it loses it's appeal quickly. Many combinations are invalid early on but after you've created a totally unrelated compound, suddenly produce an element. This makes the game frustrating.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I downloaded this game for my Droid X one day just for something to do besides Angry Birds, and I love it!  Cut the Rope is a great puzzle game...really making you think and work out how each successive level needs to be solved. And then, just when you think you've got it down, the game throws in another trick to throw you and work out.  These types of games (like Angry Birds) really are the best. You're not just aimlessly doing the same thing over and over again. You have to think and reason how to solve the \\"puzzle,\\" which has to be beneficial to your mind and add to your problem-solving skills.  Highly recommended!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|- Brilliant design and concept, yet simple and fun for hours of entertainment! I really enjoyed this game, and am setting up a payment option for Doodle Devil and Doodle Farm! what I love best are the elements themselves. I think there should be an app that acts as a guide for God, Devil, Farm, and the bonus levels (Doodle Book/Doodle Guide), showing the images and a list of quotes that each has, combinations, and games they are in! For a final note, good job fixing the app with the update so fast! I had the problem for less than an hour and you guys came to the rescue and helped everyone! Great job! -Chris D.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|If you enjoyed Shaun of The dead then you will love this as well. This is a comedy horror where two guys try to enjoy the weekend in the new cabin whilst fending off evil.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book is full of excitement and passion. It shows how love turns up. I'm in the middle of the book but so far so good. This book makes you want to read which that's what I wanted because I'm not a big fan of reading and this book make me want to get out my kindle.
0439023513|2.0|I was surprisingly taken in by Hunger Games. It was no Harry Potter, but it was very readable. Plotting was good, characters were mostly well-rounded, a satisfying finish when they outwit Snow.<br /><br />Second book was not as good, but still readable. Quarter Quell seemed like a giant cheat/cop-out, but it was interesting to see how she played the resistance and fighting scenes between all the prior winners.<br /><br />Mockingjay....ugh. A seemingly random assortment of torture, stupid military 'missions,' Kat whining, child murder, assassination. The series turned from a fairly entertaining YA adaptation of Battle Royale into a somber, turgid, anti-war polemic with a tacked-on even more depressing ending of Kat/Peeta at age ~37.<br /><br />Of course you're still going to read it. Just prepared for the inevitable disappointment.
B0063IH60K|4.0|very good game can be challenging slot of fun to play against others too see. who gets the highest score<br />one on one or in groups
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I don't get why so many people gave this one and two star reviews for a technical glitch. Come on, people! At least give them some time for a fix. I upgraded from the free version, and I love this game. Great job all around.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game but I wish there were more levels in the adventure section! Works well on the galaxy s
B007JUWM64|1.0|Given what I saw in the trailer, I wasn't expecting much. It's good to see that sometimes, you can judge the book by its cover.<br /><br />This flick was random. The plot was random. The acting was random. The time period was random. The cinematography was.... well... I'm sure you get it by now. If someone in the production team for this film had a wild hair, it got incorporated into the script. Mission Impossible rappelling bit? Check. Steampunk style airship battles? Check. Oriental martial arts wired combat? Check. Indiana Jones/Lara Croft tomb raiding? Check. High flash rapier duels? Che... oh wait... most of the rapier fighting was outclassed by brawling. But at least there was a lot of brawling.<br /><br />The core concept behind the Three Musketeers is the often quoted \\"all for one, one for all.\\" It describes how personal loyalty, honor, and courage can and MUST stand against corruption no matter how much power (political or religious) backs the actions of villainous men. But in this adaptation, it's all about independent action... treachery and betrayal from within... lost hope... and trickery to ensure that everything turns out all right. Maybe that sort of 'shades of gray' storyline seems necessary to appeal to today's audiences; but if so, we should all be horribly shamed by our part in it.<br /><br />Ironically, the one big deceit in the original (Anne's infidelity with Buckingham) is flipped into the reverse... a plot by the Cardinal that sends the diamonds to England to force the French King into going to war. Anne and her young King are evidently supposed to be the naive, innocent romantics of the piece. Fortunately, the heroes are able to capture an airship (literally a period wooden galleon suspended beneath vast canvas balloons - complete with fore, aft and broadside cannon placements) and save the day. Well... except for that fleet of airships crossing the channel there at the end. We wouldn't want to miss the opportunity to set up our sequel, would we?
B005HSL626|5.0|This game, out of my hundreds of apps, is my favourite.  This game is addicting, fun, and can kill time easily.  This is recommend to anyone who loves AWESOME APPS AND HAVING FUN!!!!
B006UG909U|3.0|First of all I love Van Halen. I have every CD. I have looked forward to the DLR reunion for some time even though I have never been on either side of the DLR v. SH battle.<br />The music is only ok. DLR's vocals are good on some and choppy on others. Some of the songs are simply rehash's of songs that were never good enough for other VH albums....so why would they be good enough now? The riff's are vintage VH and Eddie is on the top of his game on this CD but the lyric's and cadence of some of the songs are off and don't flow at all. Some of the vocals are slower, deeper and bluesier like some of DLR's solo stuff then old school VH tunes.<br />The band has had plenty of time to come up with new, fresh material but this left me feel let down.<br />Hey! When is the SH reunion album gonna come out?.....I do miss Mad Anthony on bass though. No offense Wolfie.
B000FBJG04|5.0|If you saw and enjoyed the H.B.O. series, this is a book you should read.  It goes into much more detail than the series could.  I had seen the series several times and when I got my Kindle and saw this title (and how affordable it was) I jumped at it.  I enjoy military history and found it hard to put down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is simply a wonderful book about the human condition and what could happen to us if we accept everything we're told and never take it upon ourselves to ask questions.  When you are reading this book, you will not believe it wasn't published by a \\"real\\" publisher.  I have no idea if the author ever submitted it to a big publishing house, but if he did and they passed, they are truly fools.<br /><br />This story would make a great film or TV mini-series and I enjoyed it a thousand times more than the Hunger Games.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I have tried to play several times now and the game never gets past the load screen. What a bummer. I have a droid x and haven't had this kind of issue with any other app I have tried. Fix the game so I can give you a fair rating on actual game play.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It's a shame because I was enjoying the game and hadn't played very long, only got less than 40 elements before the FC's forced me to say goodbye... free glitchy app + annoyed Android user = Uninstall DoodleGod
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I downloaded this out of curiosity when I first received my Kindle in Feb. of 2012.  I had heard the buzz and wanted to see what it was all about.<br /><br />I'm not a big video game person....but apparently my 4 year old twins are....and therein lies the problem....since they discovered this game and a few others on my Kindle, the term \\"my Kindle\\" no longer applies as it has been seized under the terms of imminent domain and I am destined to read books during school and sleep hours only.<br /><br />It sems to be a great tool to distract them for up to an hour at a time and also is effective in bribing them to behave or else loose the prviledge of play.<br /><br />Not bad for the money.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|The newest update fixed the FC on my Xperia Play. It was unplayable before. Now that I can actually play and enjoy the game I will be giving the 5 stars deserved.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I installed and opened the app only to have in crash during the splash screen.  Droid X eighteen nineteen twenty

B005TZFYNE|3.0|The impressive list of song writers for TALK THAT TALK includes Jay-Z, P Diddy, Calvin Harris, Ester Dean, Lukasz Gottwald, John Hill, Baria Qureshi, Romy Croft, Oliver Sim, Jamie Smith, Priscilla Renea and Chauncey Hollis. Rihanna has co-wrote six of the songs on TALK THAT TALK [four regular album tracks and two of the bonus tracks]: You Da One, Cockiness, Birthday Cake, Watch n Learn, Red Lipstick and Do Ya Thing. Sounds good at first glance, doesn't it? The thing is, ALL of those songs are about sex. I find the heavy repetition boring, not shocking, daring or sexy. It's like that work colleague who always drones on about her weekends; I want to tell her to p*ss off or talk about something different, because she's just boring me to tears, not impressing me or leaving me envious.<br /><br />Actually most of the album as a whole is one declaration about the joy of sex, with a few tracks dedicated to needing a man, because being single is apparently the worst thing ever. During the publicity run for her last album [Loud] Rihanna was telling us about how she had to dye her hair red because her 'team' wouldn't let her dye it pink and how she has only just been allowed to wear red lipstick over the last few years, so is TALK THAT TALK her way of rebelling?<br /><br />I was going to write a detailed track by track breakdown, about I quickly realised that I was just repeating myself, so lets just get straight to the point;<br /><br />1) She's found Mr Right (who knows how to love her hard)<br />2) She's looking for Mr Right (to love her all night long)<br />3) She's found love with someone, but their personal demons are proving to be too much.<br />This song is rumoured to be a 'love letter' to Chris Brown, but Rihanna didn't write it, so I don't know why people jumped to that conclusion.<br />4) Jay Z reminds us that he's loaded, while Rihanna tells us that she loves dirty talk.<br />5) She loves oral sex.<br />6) She really loves oral sex [the version on the album is a 80 second snippet]<br />I was really excited about the full length, download only, version of this song. But as it features Chris Brown, who promises that he's \\"gonna give to her in the worst way\\", I find it disturbing and lost all interest in the song.<br />7) Rihanna needs to find somebody to love.<br />8) She craves love and is a hopeless romantic.<br />9) A track about sex, that is thinly disguised as being about dancing.<br />10) Again it's about sex. On floors, beds and couches, it's all good.<br />11) Her friend/boyfriend is moving away, so she's saying goodbye and wishing them well.<br /><br />My main issue it that there's just not a lot of variety in the style of the lyrics shown here - the tone and content of the songs are all one of three themes from beginning to end. The only track that is different from that tired formula is Farewell.<br /><br />They really needed to mix the lyrical content and style up more since the pace of the music is the more or less the same thoughout the album. meaning that many of the tracks become lost and forgotten in the jumble of loud noise the album becomes.<br /><br />Rihanna's management say that TALK THAT TALK \\"combines a variety of musical genres such as hip hop, R&B, Caribbean, trance, electro house, electro, dancehall and dubstep\\", but in all honesty every sounds like that same old dance/pop that loads of singers do.<br /><br />The only track which shows any real difference in musical style is [once again] Farewell.<br /><br />- - - - - - -<br />Overall<br />- - - - - - -<br /><br />The first few times I listened to TALK THAT TALK I really enjoyed it, as I was happy to simply hum along to the lively, retro styled synths, but the disappointment started when I really listened to the lyrics and from that point on I found it good, but not anything amazing. Don't get me wrong; When TALK THAT TALK is at it's best we get what I think is of the strongest material Rihanna's released.<br /><br /> But, despite three strong tracks, TALK THAT TALK is still a huge let-down for me as there is a clear contrast between the quality of the material, that once you've noticed doesn't go away again.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So far this is the best game I have ever found for my kindle, although others come close. some people say the ads are distracting, but they're so small they do not bother me. quick tip, you get a golden egg if you tap the rising sun(where you select the episode you want) 3 times.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|it can really help u a(at meat it does me). It id the quickest thing and easiest thing to look at for rushed mornings. Always able to get updates. hope you like it
B0068FZ0ZG|5.0|Momma Mia is one of my all time favorite movies. I love the plot; but more than that, I love the music, which seems to fit perfectly with every scene. However, I do not see the need, or understand why you felt it necessary to have Harry become a homosexual, it does not fit into the movie at all, and seems quite out of place.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|was not good but not bad fun when i had nothing else to do. points made me mad sometimes but it is still good.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Crash, pull out battery. Try again, crash, pull out battery, Try again, crash,.......might be a nice game top give a try if it would work.
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|[[ASIN:B003UTW9ES The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (English dubbed)]]  Having read all three books, and immediately watched the movie when it arrived, I was not really confused by what happened in the movie until the end.  I felt rushed and wanted more detail.  I don't believe I would have understood much of what happened in the movie had I not read the book first.  If you have a hard time following the movie, read the book, then re-watch the movie.  But I will warn you, the books are addictive.  I wanted about two more after the third one.<br /><br />The young lady that played Lisbeth Salander was very good as was Craig's Blomkvist's character.  Her physical appearance was not brought out in the movie as it was in the book. I felt it played a very prominent role in the book (she was built like a young boy.)  The sleazy attorney came across as such. Some details at the end of the movie did not follow the book.  I had to re-watch this part because I was confused by something totally different than the book. I can only give three stars for a general review, maybe four if you've read the book.  Minus one star for the changes/omissions that I believe took away from the story.  Plus, another one star for the rushed feeling that the movie had.  It took Blomkvist most of a year to discover the truth.<br /><br />I'm a review reader rather than a review writer.  I know I am being ambivalent about TGWTDT, the movie.  The book(s) is/are worth the time.  Steig hit it out of the park with his first and last(sadly) books.
1400069289|3.0|Cue, Routine, Reward Redo<br /><br />Charles Duhigg gives real life examples of how habits are created and then changed.  Although the idea of the pattern of a cue instigating a routine, which produces a reward is not new, Duhigg wants us to believe it's simple to break habits and create new habits by instigating a different routine.  He gives examples of how major corporations incorporated new rules, which changed the way employees behave, as habits being changed.  I disagree.  If a company tells its employees that they have to follow new rules or lose their job, they'll follow those rules.  That isn't the same as breaking a bad habit.<br /><br />One example he gives is of a young uneducated man with a bad attitude, who couldn't keep a job.  Until the man went to work at Starbucks, where they trained him how to be a good employee with a good customer service attitude.  The man was trainable, which is something he hadn't yet received.  It's not the same as breaking his bad work and attitude habits and creating new ones.  He was just trained on how to behave and how that behavior would produce better results, i.e. keeping his job with future advancement.<br /><br />There's no new information when he indicates that if someone wants to lose weight they need to change their eating and exercising habits.  He gives no means of being able to do so, other than to find a different away from point A to point B other than past the vending machine.  Millions of people manage to lose weight by changing their habits, but Duhigg fails to tell us why those habits continuously creep back into our daily lives and how to keep that from happening.<br /><br />Some interesting real case stories.  No new information.  I lost interest half way through because it was just more of the same.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I love Whitney Houston. I think this is an excellent collection. I would rate it 6 stars if it only had her song \\"All the man I need\\" in the collection. Since it doesn't then I have to settle for rating it 5 stars!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app, it works great on my Kindle Fire. Nice, simple interface, I use it every day. Runs in background.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|just plain the best. how many older artist have the pleasure of the young clammering to sing with you. the voice seems as clear as it was yester year
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I LOVE this book! Although I must admit I first viewed it as a movie some years ago. It IS and always has been thought provoking as well as a source of motivation for me.<br /><br />It seems that we can always learn something new from the Secret no matter where we are in our awareness. Each time I read it, I learn on a whole new level, and can't help but wonder what I could create if I only practiced it 24-7. There are so many stories that will forever be in my heart!  I found that the book was even better than the movie as I was able to take all the amazing information and absorb it at a slower rate.<br /><br />The Secret is a beautiful testament to the human spirit! Thank you very much for sharing it with me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a graduating college student,this book was recommended to me by fellow bridesmaids at a wedding I stood up in several months prior. I was warned that this book might have some political influence (the girls knew I dislike anything to do with the government) so I backed away from the book for a bit. After seeing the title show up on my 'recommend list', I knew I had to read it- and I am so happy I did. I read the entire book in about 4 hours- I was sucked into the plot after the first chapter. The emotions I felt while reading kept me turing page after page. Needless to say, I bought the rest of the triology the next day and fnished those as well. I am excited to see how the movie will portray the characters and some violent scenes of the book; I already bought my ticket to the midnight showing!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|game would be fine if it saved game data... i have had to start over several times and its annoying as hell
0439023521|5.0|I was absolutely consumed by Panem.  The first book is by far the best of the trio. Collins writes Katniss so well that she feels like a personal friend given her diary.  Her situation, desperation, and need to overcome are palpable in their immediacy.  I could not look away even when I feared for what I'd see on the next page.  I was shocked to love this book - I usually hate violence on the page or screen - but Collins wrote a wonderful little book about people in very violent circumstances.<br /><br />One last comment - for anyone who said this was \\"unrealistic\\" and \\"could never happen\\" - I would suggest spending a little more time with your history books. I think both the Roman Empire & Nazi regime may be of particular use in your study.<br /><br />*PARENTS BEWARE: You need to read these books.  They are full of many interesting topics for discussion.  BUT THEY ARE VIOLENT. Very violent.  As a mom, I would want to know what was in them so that I could gauge my child's reactions. As an adult, I cried multiple times. I was sickened by things on the page.  The books are so amazing & well-written (aside from a few literary cliches & obvious plot devices) that it would be a shame for a young adult not to explore them but it would be easy to get lost in the violence and miss the grander themes without some adult guidance. (SPOILER ALERT (very minor) You also need to remind your children that super-pretty endings full of dancing Ewoks really only happen in feel-good action movies. Violence rarely, if ever, makes people happier. Collins doesn't shy away from that lesson.)
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Saw people giving a bad review, for me the app is running great.  I'm using it at a Samsung Galaxy S.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great book, a must read. This could be anyone of our family's or friends. Learn the warning signs for suicide. You could save a life!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Was waiting for update to fix the force close before reviewing just updated. Fun game to pick up and mess around.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The rebel in me almost wanted to not like this book just because everybody else is so nuts over it. As soon as I began reading and learned that people were sending their children off to fight to the death, without starting any sort of rebellion, I really had a hard time accepting it. I mean, so what if District 13 was obliterated? You don't send your kids off to fight to the death!! Who would do that? And why is everybody evil enough to watch this as entertainment? It haunted me for days, almost as if it were really happening in the world. I thought about it while I brushed my teeth and while I drove to work. I argued about it to my husband, who had no idea what I was talking about. In the meantime, I continued reading. I accepted the fact that maybe dystopian novels just aren't my thing, but decided to give this one a chance.<br /><br />And then I was hooked.<br /><br />And I mean hooked. I read this book in a couple of days, even sneaking chapters in while at work. I loved Katniss' character. I half expected her to be cold and uncaring, growing up as she did. But I found her very much the opposite in her relationships with Prim, Peeta, Rue, even Haymitch. I found myself comparing her to Remy in Amanda Hocking's Hollowland, and there was a huge difference in likeability. Remy pushed everybody away...so I found this refreshing.<br /><br />I must say I'm not looking forward to the inevitable love triangle in book 2, but God knows I'll be digging into it as soon as I get home from work.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I played the game for about 20 minutes and now it force closes all the time. I can't play it at all.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best app I have found so far, paid or unpaid. works better than just about every app for reading the Bible.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|this is a really fun game especially for kindle fire. little bits of humor great help features. works especially well since the patch was released
145162445X|1.0|Doing philosophy without knowing philosophy is very dangerous. This is a good example of what is not science but a pack of outpassed materialist philosophy.
B002G1YPH0|2.0|I purchased this cooler off the awesome reviews it got. I understood it was big (I have a full tower case) but the problem I have with this cooler is the cooling! I have an i5 2500k and this thing could not keep it cool. I applied the paste (arctic silver 5) with parallel lines on the HSF (as suggested but not from the crap instructions), I added an additional fan for extra cooling and my temps with prime95 would hit 78c!!! OK, so I think to myself, maybe its installed incorrectly, so I go on youtube, I go on the internet, read up as much as I can on the installation and I reseat the HSF and reapply paste. Temps are 75c at load...not worth my time or money. I think I will get something with a smooth base and not with the pipes where paste can be tough to fill, I'm not lucky with those types of HSF's I guess.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I started out with the free but upgraded to the paid because I like it si much. I appreciate how you can use up to 3 sounds together. very soothing and helps me to sleep.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|The film may have been a little slow and low key, but it is worth the effort.  The tension builds as the viewer tries to figure out who the big mole is.  I enjoyed it because the whole \\"Fourth Man\\" deal is fascinating.  Some of the action actually happened in DC and Northern Virginia (where I live).  Guy Burgess kicked up a fuss one Sunday speeding around and picking up tickets, all to get him called back to England, so he could run to Moscow.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Game is a bad rip off of Alchemy, which is far superior to this garbage, the game teases other chapters or modes but doesn't explain how to access them. App really isn't worth a try, 2.5 stars as an average review is too generous.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Added to my Kindle Fire, found a video I wanted to save, waited about 15 minutes for the video to download, went into \\"Downloaded\\", and nothing there but an advertisement. UPDATE: I found this morning that the video does not show up in the \\"Downloaded\\" section of the App on the Kindle Fire........it dropped the video directly into my Gallery folder, and it plays great!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love Alchemy type games, and Doodle God is really quite awesome for the genre. I've been playing it for hours on my Kindle Fire, to the point that I've run the battery down and need to recharge. It's really quite fun and very well done. I must've downloaded the updated version because I have had zero problems with it on my Fire... other than not being able to stop! Thanks for the game!

B003Y5H5HY|4.0|I loved the movie and agree, you will enjoy it much more if you have read the book.  My bf hadn't and was a bit lost.  I thought I was getting a blu ray, DVD and the digital copy but I didn't read closely enough.  The DVD is a supplement, not the DVD of the movie.  I too couldn't stream the digital copy because it had expired.  That's a real disappointment.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Who cares how much money it didn't make at the box office or how much money it cost to make; this movie is wonderful. Saw it multiple times at the theater and came away each time with something new. Even my wife -- a known SciFi hater -- loved the film.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is such a wonderful thing to be able to leave my reader at home & be able to read when I've got spare time.  Sitting in the BMV branch, my book marks are synced & I am ready to go.<br />Amazon's cloud network is wonderful.  I can download what I'm reading & delete the remaining books from my phone so that they don't use up too much storage.<br />My reader will always be my preference for electronic reading, but being able to have a pocket reader with me wherever I go is just lovely.
B004NTDEXY|3.0|I cannot believe they paired an awesome movie such as American History X (5 stars) with one of the WORST movies I've ever seen... A History of Violence (no stars). Seriously, I am going to throw away that 2nd useless disc and cut the Blu-Ray insert in half accordingly so I never again have to be reminded of 2 of the most boring hours of my life. Viggo Mortensen was frickin Aragorn! Why the hell did he ever accept this role? Same for you Ed Harris! I'm going to go read some RA Salvatore and attempt to make the bad feeling I have go away. Buy American History X BY ITSELF!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I don't know why people are giving this game bad reviews.  Its such a fun game, and on the kindle, I haven't experienced any glitches.  Ive played this game before on the Internet, and I loved it, and now to have it on the kindle is just wonderful.  Great graphics, fun yet challenging, everything you would want an app to be!!!!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I'm having so much fun with this app I just wish it didn't have the freezing issue, I've only had it freeze once so far, hopefully the problem will get fixed soon, still going to play despite the issue...
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Masters and Commanders is an excellent movie. Its portrayal of life at sea at that time seems very realistic. Wonderful acting. Very interesting movie.
B000H6SXMY|2.0|I was happy when I received my new box set. Until I noticed that I have 2 number 3's. I don't have the last episodes and now I have to try to find the last discs that I don't havem
B007GE2H3G|5.0|We rented TinTin and after watching with the family we had to buy it immediately! The graphics were incredible unlike some of the other 3D style animations like Polar Express.  It was so lifelike we had to remind ourselves that this was an animation.  The story line was as exciting as any adventure film with such likable characters.  TinTin is an amazing kid/man who can do anything and if you are fans of the comic this will not disappoint.<br /><br />Everyone loved it- (ages 4-10 and adult) No one lost attention and the story line was exciting and easy for even the littler kids to understand.<br /><br />We were also so excited to know that Peter Jackson was a producer and his WETA studio worked on it.  With his incredible work with graphics on LOTR this was no doubt going to be excellent.  Jamie Bell is also one of our favorites (Billy Elliot, Jumper - he stole the show, and Jane Eyre) and we were excited to know he was TinTin.  And Andy (Gollum) was Captain Haddock.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I rented the movie at all and didn't just trust our instincts and buy it... We ordered the blu-ray/DVD/digital copy combo so we can watch it at all times.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I enjoyed this, I had no more problems than normal when I played this game. A a a a a a a
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.  It was very well written and I couldn't put it down.  That is high praise since I don't have a lot of reading time on my Hands.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i really like the concept of this... there's lots of games to play and winning them gives you more games.. i love it on my kindle fire
B006MW3VGA|5.0|We watched Downton Abbey's first season some time ago and enjoyed it.  When this came out, we were excited to watch it.  We weren't disappointed.  This show is very well written and acted.  Each episode holds your attention and makes you come back for more.  I'm looking forward to a third season!
1118109791|5.0|I started GMAT Club - online MBA community; my GMAT score is 750 (49, 42), and here are my thoughts about this book:<br /><br />~~~ Strengths ~~~<br />1. 907 real GMAT questions retired from past tests (158 new questions in this edition). The total has not changed<br />2. Practice questions are organized by level of difficulty<br />3. Practice questions follow actual GMAT test patterns (it's great to have one's ear trained, esp. in verbal)<br />4. Contains a 100-question diagnostic test<br />5. Overview of the Integrated Reasoning section (50 questions)<br /><br />~~~ Weaknesses ~~~<br />1. Does not include any test-taking strategies<br />2. Though it has a few short review sections for each area, they are weak and very unfriendly<br />3. Questions are predominantly low to medium in difficulty which is often not representative of questions one encounters on the test<br />4. There is an 83% overlap with the previous edition (12th edition). Compared to 66% overlap between OG 12 and OG 11<br /><br />~~~ Contents (number of questions per section)~~~<br />1. Diagnostic Test - 100 questions<br />2. Problem Solving - 230 questions<br />3. Data Sufficiency - 174 questions<br />4. Reading Comprehension - 139 questions<br />5. Critical Reasoning - 124 questions<br />6. Sentence Correction - 140 questions<br />7. Integrated Reasoning - 50 questions (not included in the 907 count)<br /><br />~~~ What Questions Are New? ~~~<br />* Problem Solving<br />12, 13, 14, 15, 37, 49, 56, 57, 60, 61, 69, 71, 75, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 91, 92, 108, 110, 112, 113, 114, 117, 118, 119, 127, 128, 129, 137, 158, 163, 166, 170, 177, 178, 182, 183, 196, 198, 199, 218, 229.<br /><br />* Data Sufficiency<br />11, 15, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25, 29, 32, 33, 34, 37, 39, 41, 42, 52, 57, 65, 70, 74, 75, 79, 80, 83, 85, 92, 96, 97, 99, 102, 109, 123, 131, 133, 141.<br /><br />* Critical Reasoning<br />1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17, 19, 22, 29, 33, 39, 49, 59, 65, 69, 74, 81, 86, 94, 100, 106, 114, 124<br /><br />* Reading Comprehension<br />Passage 1 (Questions 1-4), Passages 4&5 (Questions 11-17), Passage 9 (Questions 37-41), Passage 12 (Questions 52-55), Passage 17 (Questions 84-86), Passage 22 (Questions 111-114)<br /><br />* Sentence Correction<br />1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, 26, 35, 38, 40, 48, 56, 65, 68, 71, 74, 79, 87, 97, 107, 111, 114, 132, 138<br /><br />*** Why is this book valuable/must-have?<br />The Official Guide is published by the creators of the GMAT and therefore it is the only source of actual GMAT questions representative of what you will see on the test.<br /><br />***  Why is the book not sufficient by itself?<br />This Guide contains only questions and lacks insightful information about the test, a math/verbal concept review section, or any test-taking strategies. To get up to speed, you will need to get a study guide such as Kaplan Premier Program or Manhattan GMAT's 8 guides.<br /><br />***  How should this book be used?<br />This book should NOT be used as a study-guide. It is a collection of questions - think of it as a way to practice your test-taking strategies but not a way to learn them.<br /><br />***  What if I own a previous edition of this book?<br />If you have the 12th edition, the only differences between the two are 157 new questions and IR section overview (there is an online companion for IR). Most test-takers agree that 157 new questions is not a compelling enough reason to own both editions, as the 12th edition offers enough practice. However, if you are taking the test after June 5th, you do want this book for the IR section.<br /><br />*** What is a recommended study plan using The Official Guide?<br />There are a number of approaches that work - here is one that most find reasonable:<br /><br />Step 1: Buy a GMAT Guide from Kaplan (will take about a month to cover it). Get familiar with the test and brush up on fundamentals (math and grammar); also these books will give you a good base for test-taking and timing strategies. This is enough for a 600-level score. I would also recommend to everyone to get GMAT Roadmap by MGMAT. It is a great book packed with common sense and student wisdom on how to best approach the GMAT.<br /><br />Step 2: Take a GMAT Prep (2 free tests downloadable from MBA.com) - but don't waste these; these are free but very valuable tests. Take 1 after you go through the Guidebooks and save the second one for later. These tests will be representative of your GMAT score (plus/minus 40 points).<br /><br />Step 3: (Optional - if you want a 650+ score) Get a specialized Math and/or Verbal workbook from Kaplan, the 8-book set form Manhattan GMAT, or Veritas Prep Guides and do a deep dive into the fundamentals - this is what will help you crack the test - solid knowledge of Math and Grammar. You should also look into the MGMAT Foundations of GMAT Verbal and MGMAT Foundations of GMAT Math.<br /><br />Step 4: By now you should have a good understanding of question patterns, strategies, and timing. Start working on the Official Guide and honing your skills - this is especially important for Critical Reasoning questions that have certain unspoken patterns and rules that only the Official Guide offers - work through the questions to train your ear. Keep in mind that these questions are on the easier side if you are aiming for 650+.<br /><br />*** What are some of the good study suggestions?<br />- Start with a practice test (diagnostic test)<br />- You need quality time. It is really the quality time (morning for some and evening for others) that provides the most retention and results<br />- Don't skip or move past a section until you're able to solve 90% of the questions correctly (timed of course). That is if you want 700+<br />- Never solve questions without timing yourself (unless it is quick drills)<br />- Don't jump into the hardest areas first - build confidence instead with what you know and can demonstrate progress at<br />- Start every new day with the review of what you havelearned the day before<br />- Make notes for everything you cover - it helps tremendously to retain what you have learned even though you may never read them.

B007IQX1G4|3.0|I watched this movie with some hesitation due to the reviews.  I'm not sure how anyone would even consider this a comedy - even a dark comdedy.  There was nothing funny about it.  I saw it as more of a story about a young woman with real mental problems.  She was quite pathetic and delusional.  Sadly, I know people who aren't that far from this character.  So, I watched it as more of a character movie and enjoyed the journey of a young woman who is stuck in the past and on herself.
0439023513|5.0|I must say after reading the first two novels I was a little shy of this one. The 3/5 stars worried me greatly. I couldn't understand how Collins would fail and now I know she didn't in the least and that those reviews and reviewers were skewed. It's a little stunning to read reviews where people expect the entire cast to make it out alive. You're kidding, right? Both sides of war in these novels are vicious and unapologetic. Nothing is convenient about her choices. Katniss and Peeta are both spiraling out of control because of grief and torture respectively, and somehow readers find this annoying. I just can't get my head around it.<br /><br />That being said, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Katniss is presented with the daunting task of becoming The Mockingjay. She has no idea what this means and it isn't natural for her. At times I think it will never make any sense and I'm gripping myself for a let down. Then, it happens. You do not see this coming. You do not see this coming because she is so beaten down and seemingly weak. She is broken. She is scared. She is sad. And yet something inside of her is still ticking along just fine. It was very powerful for me. I asked myself if I could have done it and I don't like my answer. Katniss is still herself. She is strong and brave and disconnected.<br /><br />What Collins has done with Snow's character is brilliant. Katniss's last conversation with him made me like her even more than I already had. Why? Because she isn't affected by where the truth comes from as long as she gets it. Many people are not born with this quality, and are easily led because of it.<br /><br />The Peeta and Gale debate has not changed. They are the two people they always were. Didn't we know from Hunger Games who was best for her? There were no cheap shots taken at the triangle, contrary to popular belief. Listen to what they say. Watch what they do. Read very carefully the words of reflection Katniss has about each brief and scattered encounter. This is important because if you do not read carefully, you could fall into the same bunker other fans have. Do not blame Collins for something cheap, when what she has given is so pure and purposefully driven.<br /><br />As far as many characters falling, that is what war does. Only one death in the entire novel felt contrived.<br /><br />The ending for me was perfection. No Katniss isn't basking in the glory of her accomplishments. Her life as she knew it in that bleak mess of a town is gone. It was her home. That was all she knew. People are changed or gone, and she isn't even herself anymore. Gee, I wonder why? It makes perfect sense and even with the sadness, she is happy. Deep down she knows this all had to happen for everyone to be free. It is painful to live with the memories of what was, but it is exciting to live in a new world that she helped create for the good of its people. And more importantly, she can function better knowing she has someone to love her who will never leave willingly.
B0076NKNLA|4.0|I watch movies to be entertained and this movie was enjoyable.  The story and acting were good and at times, it seemed like I was watching the real Marilyn Monroe.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Game is entertaining but lags way too much and kicks out the game or forces phone to reboot. DroidX2. Fix stability problems and this game could get more stars.
1400165172|5.0|This is very well read and enjoyable. It's good to have all the stories on one disc as I listen to them in bed after I turn the light out. The only crit I have is that there's no index to tell you what order the stories are in, but if you know Sherlock well you'll realise they're in the same order as in the book. Much recommended and I look forward to getting more in this series.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|Woody Allen has been in love with Paris for a long time. \\"Everyone Says I Love You\\" took us there, but \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a masterpiece. Perhaps this quote from Hemingway sums it up: \\"Though I often looked for one, I finally had to admit that there could be no cure for Paris.\\"<br /><br />Personally, I think that this film should have won Best Picture, Best Director and many other awards. \\"The Artist\\" was predictable. \\"The \\"Descendants\\" annoyed me. If any child of mine spoke to me that way, I'd up-end them! But \\"Midnight in Paris\\" was a charming, feel-good film that satisfied my romantic longings. It was beautifully filmed, artistic, intelligent, well-acted, well-directed... what more could you ask of a film? I think that this is the crowning glory for Woody Allen's films. I've recommended it to many of my friends.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|was force closing. but the new update works. using moto xoom. only suggestion will be to disable combining doodles which have already been previously combined. thanks
B004E5GG50|4.0|Jonathan Rhys Meyers is amazing as Henry VIII. I got over expecting him to be fat and got into the complex character of the man. The writing is wonderful and the tension builds, however, crunching two characters into one and misstating events rather annoys me, hence only 4 stars rather than 5. Henry's elder sister was Margaret, and she married James IV, King of Scots. She re-married to Archibald Douglas. Then, we have Mary Tudor, the younger sister, and queen consort of France by marriage to Louis XII. After his death. she secretly married Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, without Henry's consent. Big uproar. But where did either of them marry the King of Portugal and suffocate him in the marriage bed??? Artistic license only goes so far and cannot re-write history. Oh well, I still enjoy the great acting, the writing, the costumes, sets, etc.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Let's face it: David Fincher's at his best when he's trying to creep us out.  He can give us a character-study drama about building an online empire (THE SOCIAL NETWORK), or a fantasy about Brad Pitt aging backwards for some reason (BENJAMIN BUTTON), but Fincher works best in the real of the thriller: SE7EN still remains (in this reviewer's opinion) his strongest, most fully-conceived film, with FIGHT CLUB and ZODIAC ranking pretty high up there.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO falls into this mind-freak category, with genuine thrills (even for those who've read the book and seen the original film), some solid performances, a fantastic script, incredible visuals and sound--basically, everything you've come to expect from a Fincher thriller.<br /><br />The plot is far from simple; as with the first film, this movie bogs down in the novel's convoluted story (following two protagonists, going back and forth in time, lingering on subplots that could easily have been trimmed).  It's basically the story of disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (a subtle and engaging Daniel Craig), who is hired by billionaire Henrik Vanger (a regal Christopher Plummer, in the midst of a late-career resurgence) to solve the decades' old murder of his niece.  Along the way, Blomkvist recruits tough-but-vulnerable girl Lisabeth Salander (a very capable, occasionally surprising Rooney Mara) who has a knack for computer hacking and revenge.<br /><br />DRAGON TATTOO, for you newcomers, is basically what THE GODFATHER would have been if it were a techno-thriller-mystery.  Which probably makes no sense.  That's okay; you'll either love this film for its pseudo-gothic vibes, or hate it for its forced overtones of darkness.  One thing everyone can agree on are the performances, from the two leads to the stellar supporting cast: Robin Wright, Stellan Skarsgard, Joely Richardson, even the grossly-overlooked Julian Sands in a wordless flashback role (talk about wasted talent, but he makes the most of it).  The script, too, is top-notch; Steve Zaillan's penned everything from MONEYBALL to GANGS OF NEW YORK, and he still keeps finding new tricks up his sleeve.  Kudos must also be heaped upon Fincher's ever-reliable cohort Trent Reznor, for providing a killer soundtrack.  (Oh, and at least watch the film for the opening credits sequence; think Bond in Hell.)<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's original novel was a very well-written and engaging tome, if a bit overlong and meandering (it could have been half its length and still been okay); the American film version trims the fat a little (it's still over 2.5 hours long), but falls to many of the same inconsistencies.  Why, then, the five stars?  Because of the way Fincher and company overcome the challenges.  It's not a crime classic in the way that SE7EN is, and probably never will be.  But there's a lot here to love (or hate, as many will, for a wide variety of reasons, many of them legitimate), and for Fincher's growing legions of fans, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO will go down as a particular favorite.it).

030771652X|2.0|I may be in the minority on my views about this book but as much as I really wanted to like it, it just never came to be. Initially I was intrigued by this book, although a little like the Guernsey Literary Potato Peel Society in the sense that the story is almost written by Beatrice in a letter to her sister and a style I am not fond of, the premise was interesting to me. Beatrice is the storyteller. She is an English woman who now lives in New York and is contacted when her sister Tess goes missing in London. Beatrice, clearly cared deeply for her sister and wants to find out who would do this to her Sister.<br /><br />Beatrice moves into Tess' London flat, starts wearing her clothes and sort of lives her sister's life prior to her untimely demise. Her sister is found dead in a park bathroom. The ruling is that she comitted suicide after her baby dies shortly after it's birth. Beatrice does not believe her sister would ever do this and so continues on her quest to find out the truth. In her search she meets up with other Women pregnant at the same time as Tess who were part of a Cystic Fibrosis study. These women were all said to be pregnant with babies that more than likely would be born with Cystic Fibrosis and the study may help to change that. However the study is not so cut and dry.<br /><br />There is a twist at the end but the story just seems to go on and on. I felt the book could have been cut in half and told the same story. I was left very disappointed in the end.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|I know this is going to sound dumb/bold, but... JUST BUY IT. It does an amazing job keeping my CPU cooled down.<br /><br />Before I applied the compound, I would roughly get temperatures of around 45C to 50C, doing normal web browsing, such as Youtube, Facebook, etc. Now, since I applied it to my CPU a few weeks ago, I'm getting temperatures of roughly 23C to 45C-ish. (When I'm watching HD videos it goes around the 45C area) That's roughly 20C reduced while doing normal web browsing since I used the compound.<br /><br />So all in all, buy it. It works. It does what it says on the tin. For $7 it's totally worth it.<br /><br />I can tell that I'll be using this brand for a long time.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|We learn a lot more about Christian Grey in this book, and while it was nice to finally get to the crux of some of his issues, the time table really really bugged me. Things that seem to take a week (or a month, or several months) take 1 day or 1 hour in this book. The timeline is unrealistic and it bothered me throughout the book. There were times I thought that days had gone by, but really, it's still the same day. It seemed unrealistic that their relationship would move at such warp speed so fast.<br /><br />Other things that bothered me included Ana's reaction to Christian's new proposal when he takes her to Jose's(really Ana?) and Jose - he really had no place in this story and he was just thrown in there. Also, it seems that the Charlie Tango incident will be bigger and more important in book 3 and it was thrown in at the end of this book with little to no explanation. For one who spent so much time describing the damn boat scene and sailing, the helicopter accident made no sense to me.<br /><br />I think this book tried to do too much and it was hard to grasp everything - Ana and Christian, Christian's issues, Ana's job (and her boss), the Leila story, the Elena showdown, the helicopter incident, Kate, Mia, Jose, the playroom and Ana's feelings towards it. The meeting with Dr. Flynn...It all made it harder to connect with their relationship (especially Christian's revelations and what he finally let Ana do). Whatever happened to taking time to let things develop? All this really happened in 16 days? That's insane.<br /><br />I don't think this book presents a healthy relationship. I find Christian to be manipulative and selfish and Ana to be naive and not willing to stand up for herself. I think the author should have taken her own advice about walking before crawling. Christian thinks he can placate Ana when he makes her mad (and usually rightfully so) by having sex with her which isn't fair. And while it's commendable that Ana is willing to try things in the playroom, she loses all focus and all reasoning in her fights if Christian makes a move. What kind of message does that send?<br /><br />I think Dr. Flynn's comment was revealing and helps me be a little ok with things - Christian has the emotional maturity of an adolescent. Maybe that's why he's so needy and needs so much reassurance and is kind of possessive.<br /><br />I'd like to see Ana and Christian's relationship really develop and flourish - not just in the bedroom but outside of it too. (oh and why bother having Christian talk to Ray when Ray isn't even present? Stop throwing characters in there because you mentioned them in the first book. Also, Christian's \\"family\\" is way too much like Edward Cullen's \\"family -- Elliot and Mia = Emmett and Alice.)
0984999302|5.0|The Startup Owner's Manual is exactly what the title implies.  It's a comprehensive reference guide for entrepreneurs of all types and for any situation.  Warning: this book is not to be read cover to cover, so do not attempt to do so.  Instead, I refer to it on a daily-basis based on whatever challenge I'm facing at the moment, from defining core business hypotheses to customer interviews to going out on a sales call.  It contains step-by-step best practices and examples for all of these things.  It's a must-have for all aspiring, first-time, and seasoned entrepreneurs.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This was an interesting book. I don't think I liked several aspects of it, while I loved other aspects. At the core, I liked the questions it raises: Who are you? How much self respect do you have? Are you willing to explore? How far are you willing to compromise yourself for another? Are you even willing to compromise for another? Is it better to be inexperienced or experienced?<br /><br />However, on the flip side, I think the book raises more questions than it answers. Christian Grey comes off as a stalker with an unhealthy obsession and his pursuit of Ana strikes me as odd. When he found out how inexperienced she was with his world, I was shocked to see he still pursued her. I also was shocked to see that both of her parents were so Ok with her dating Christian (who the book claims to be 27, but seems 37, in my opinion). The incompatibilities between Ana and Christian are huge, and I feel like the author glosses over them a lot with sex. The book also doesn't delve a lot into the world of Doms/Subs and for readers who aren't remotely familiar with that world and the lifestyle, the book makes it seem easy and erotic, when there's a lot more to it. I can see why a bunch of rich housewives on the Upper East Side want to relive this \\"fantasy\\" but I think they're presented with an incomplete picture.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars because I liked Ana - she's going through major life changes and meets Christian and falls for him. Graduating from college, moving, trying to find a job, and finding someone you love (who just happens to be into a lifestyle you didn't even know exist) is a lot for anyone to handle. Oh yes, and he's super rich. I wanted to learn more about Christian and his \\"hard limits\\" but I realize that if we learn everything in one book, there's no point in sequels and for E.L. James to get richer. Ana's confusion is real, but the answers she gets suck. I wanted her to have more. I loved the ending - the last occurrence in the \\"red room of pain\\" wasawesome and I was proud of Ana. Maybe as I learn more about Christian I'll be able to understand him more, but to me, he's selfish and unyielding and he's doing the same thing to Ana that Mrs. Robinson did to him. Sex as a weapon is never a good thing. Christian can't be all \\"why don't you talk to me\\" when he doesn't talk to Ana.<br /><br />I also agree with other reviews I read that sense similarities between Edward/Bella in the Twilight Saga and Christian/Ana (even down to their looks!) and to me that was weird. The only difference is that Christian isn't a vampire.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Not quite done yet, but very interesting. Hard to believe he is still alive, but is a musical genius without any formal education or training. Have to give him credit, and all the Stones for that matter - their longevity and endurance is unheard of in today's musical environment. Very interesting read, but the drug days and explanations do kind of drag out.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|All my complaints for the 2nd book have been magnified for the 3rd book and what could have been an interesting story came up very short. I'm not sure if the book was supposed to be Grey's story, Ana's story, or a jumble.<br /><br />If Grey was supposed to be sympathetic and we were supposed to cheer at his awakening that he can love and be loved and he doesn't have to whip and beat brunettes that look like his mom -- the book failed. Instead Grey comes across as controlling as ever, a petulant child who 1. flies across the country when he doesn't get his way; 2. storms into Ana's office when he doesn't get his way and 3. uses sex as both a weapon and a punishment when Ana crosses some invisible boundary. He expects Ana to respect his feelings and his boundaries, but never ever respects hers. Either Ana is stupid or blinded by love - his actions after her drink with Kate were borderline insane, his storming into her office about her name was ridiculous and ludicrous, and his reaction to the \\"accident\\" because of the missed appointments was apoplectic. And Ana never firmly stood her ground! She let Grey walk all over her and her feelings over and over again and abuse her in the playroom. (Yeah, she said \\"red\\" but is that what it takes to get through to him? Talking doesn't work?)<br /><br />The trip to Aspen was stupid and made no sense; Ana seeing Gia with Elliott also was never explained; Ray's car accident seemed a way to get Jose back into the story; Elena was an unnecessary addition, and the Jack Hyde storyline was mishandled badly. There were too many veiled references and incomplete explanations and by time the storyline rolled around, I didn't even care. His vendetta against Grey and his family wasn't fully explained, and I had an issue with the way things were so neatly wrapped up. If Grey told Ana to take all of his money because it meant nothing to him and he was just going to let her go, then why did he track her? That whole bank scene bugged me a lot.<br/><br />Finally, the epilogue and the meet Christian Grey part of the book was unnecessary. All it did was drag the story on for no reason. And the couple of chapters from Christian's point of view were so much like Stephanie Meyer's \\"Midnight Sunrise\\" E.L. James should be sued for plagiarizing.<br /><br />What I would have liked to see more of was their relationship growing - their wedding even, instead of just in flashbacks. All we got was Ana didn't want to do what Christian wanted, so she didn't, and he got mad and she said \\"please don't be mad at me\\" or he went overboard and she got mad and he didn't know what to do but have sex. I don't care how hot he is, how rich he is, how good the sex scenes are - the book was an empty unfulfilled storyline of 2 people that could have been more - instead they were empty shells of characters who had a lot of sex.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|After the very good opening film in the Guy Richie Sherlock Holmes franchise- A Game Of Shadows takes the series to another level. There is a real feeling that the actors have a firmer grasp on their characters. It can also be said that Richie seems to be in more of a flow in this second installment. How many times can we actually say that a second film in a series improves upon the first?<br /><br />First and foremost, Robert Downey Jr is an extremely gifted actor. Most people know that, but his command of this role is exceptional. You have probably seen the extent of his preparation in regards to the proper English accent he had to master- before ever getting infront of the camera! His acting in this film is up there with Chaplin and his other great performances. He is Sherlock Holmes and I believe any version of Sherlock in the future will be hard pressed to equal Downey's version. And Sherlock definately needs a worthy Watson. Enter Jude Law. The perfect sidekick, who has to shake off Sherlock's barbs at times, but is equal at firing back. Its part of the charm of these movies. When the going is rough they are a perfect team. When they are at each other's throats- they're just as perfect.<br /><br />Watson's wedding and honeymoon should have been great memories for him- too bad Sherlock is working on \\"the single greatest case\\" of his career! That means- edge of your seat action, mystery and not the least of all ruining poor Watson's honeymoon! The scenes where Sherlock and Watson are on the train are some of the funnier moments of the film. \\"I'm on my honeymoon!\\" \\"Did you just kill my new wife!\\". To top it off, Sherlock's disguise!<br /><br />The men are in pursuit of Professor James Moriarty. A challenging opponent for Sherlock, which is proven countless times throughout the film. Mr.Moriarty is waiting for an outbreak of war, because he owns a large weopons cache/factory. Sherlock must get to the professor before France and Germany put Europe in turmoil. Thereare some classic confrontations between Sherlock and the professor. Great dialogue and witty banter back and forth. The two men finish a chess game without even looking at the board, while talking about their own personal moves in the next room. That is a great scene.<br /><br />Not to be forgotten in all the excitement- are the scenes with the gypsies. Sherlock's interest in the gypsies is for the sister of Renee. Noomi Rapace -from The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo- is excellent in this role. And a natural fit with the other actors. There are several great scenes with Sherlock and Watson trying to mix with the gypsies. Then theres the case of how Sherlock will travel across the countryside- have to see this!<br /><br />Lets hope there is a 3rd installment. It looks like a sure bet, but things can change. I think Downey and Law have great comedic chemistry. It would be great to see these guys atleast one more time playing these iconic characters. And adding another chapter in Sherlock lore.<br /><br />The End?
B001P9KR8U|5.0|2009 was an incredible year for movies. Slumdog Millionaire continued that theme and swept most of the awards shows. It was dubbed \\"the little movie that could\\". This film is a triumph. It is the perfect love story that follows a man and a woman from when they met as children to when they were reunited as adults, after a long list of tragedies happens to them both. It never fails to choke me up by the end. My favourite part, after they reunite in the end, is the Bollywood dance to \\"Jai Ho\\".<br /><br />The cinematography in this film is so unique and I really enjoyed it. As far as the DVD itself goes, I couldn't be happier. The picture is flawless, the sound is perfect, and I can watch it over and over. As always, I'm a sucker for special features. This movie delivers all around.
0316098329|5.0|This was an excellent book about a woman's survival.  I couldn't wait to get back to the book and finish reading.  I told my husband the story and he was anxious to hear more.
B003E88TKS|5.0|2009 was a really good year for movies and this one is no exception. This is one of my favourite movies of all time. George Clooney stars as a man who is a serial traveler for work and essentially lives in airports. He can't form relationships because he is always on the go. The movie makes a deep statement about how freeing and isolating this lifestyle is at the same time. He finally makes a connection with a woman he meets who has a similar lifestyle, but she eventually gives him the shock of his life when he realizes she has a grounded life as well.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with this movie. The story, acting, and soundtrack are all flawless. I never tire of watching it. Amazon's Instant Play is a great service, as well. The streaming is so smooth and the sound quality is great. I wish rentals were a little cheaper, though.
1935670913|1.0|This book is just an advertisement for his previouse books. This is junk and you will not learn anything from this author. Silly how his loyal customers are making a fool out of other paying customers who want to learn to write and self publish. Do not buy this book. I returned this book, and I never return books. I just could not keep this book in my library. I felt insulted.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|I have watched a lot of bad but well hyped movies.  This one is one of the worst.<br /><br />Good acting but it was like watching paint dry.
B000OVLINI|1.0|I finally gave up on this book halfway through it.  I kept reading that long because of all the favorable reviews.  But, halfway through, I still didn't care about any of the characters or even the plot.  It is a very \\"wordy\\" book with a confusing list of characters.  I lost track of who characters were and how they fit into the story.  It certainly did not live up to to hype.
031617615X|5.0|I love this movie, can't wait until part 2 comes out! I watch it over and over!! Love it and plus I'm reading the books!
1594203334|5.0|This is a book that every parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, teacher and child care worker could learn something from.  And, I think about \\"Bringing Up Bebe\\" every time I am in a restaurant and kids are running around the tables, throwing food or screaming when the rest of us are trying to enjoy a meal.  Many American parents tend to be neurotic and overly permissive (I was one of them), when they should take control of a given situation.  This book, in a very entertaining way, demonstrates how it can be done (and is done in Paris).
B004T2QZL8|2.0|would be a fun version of alchemy, played for maybe a half hour then bam constantly force closes on first pair. nothing helps, boo.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Disclaimer: I knew nothing about the subject matter when I ordered the book. I merely saw the headline of an article that declared it was what all the book club ladies were reading.<br /><br />Oh Mr. Grey, I underestimated your appeal!<br />Oh Ms. Amazon Book Reviewer, you know you loved it.<br />Oh Mr. Grey, the smirking, the brooding, the sulking.<br />Oh Ms. Amazon Book Reviewer, someone needs a spanking.<br />Oh Miss Steele, the inner goddess? Really?<br />Oh Ms. Amazon Book Reviewer, you ordered all three books. Separately. Smirks<br /><br />So, much like how I don't care if memoir writers are fabulists, (an opinion that has evolved) (see James Frey) I don't care if a novel is poorly written,(see hundreds of furious reviewers blasting E. L. James' writing skills) as long as it at least tells a good story, (see Amazon Book Rankings) or shines a light on something I didn't know very much about (see Wikipedia entry, BDSM, Anne Rice, 9/12 Weeks and Story of O).<br /><br />This trilogy falls into the \\"didn't know about all that\\" and romance writing must be harder than it seems. Surely. It must.<br /><br />Although the \\"known unknowns and unknown unknowns,\\" of the subject matter were briefly fascinating and then quickly monotonous and frankly a little alarming (see Urinary Tract Infection prevention), I had to finish what I started. I figure that counts for something. Don't ya think Mr. Grey?<br /><br />Oh Ms. Amazon Book Reviewer, \\"Your jaded indifference doesn't fool me,\\" he smirks. And smirks some more.<br /><br />I don't think I'll recommend to my book club lady friends(see Oprah Book Club Selections).<br /><br />But as for you? Well, order one and then decide for yourself.<br /><br />Oh Ms. Amazon Book Reviewer, damming with faint praise are you?<br />Oh Mr. Grey, it's time to submit my review.<br />His eyes widen and then<br />he smirks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best word for all age ... is the best game for people who can be bored fast ..... ....... ....... ....... ...... ......... .......  ......  ............. ............ ........... .........
B004T2QZL8|2.0|what's the deal with all the freakin force closing???? I.can only play for three seconds before it shuts down &gt;:(
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I played Doodle devil before and it was good but this is way better. you should at least try it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|what a fantastic app for encouraging folks to get in and stay in the Word. the features are great to keep track of your reading plan progress, mark and share verses, and reminders to give five minutes to change your life! I like that u can download offline versions too. praise God!
078322947X|4.0|This is the movie that made me start paying attention to Roy Schieder. Playing a mobster on the run, he finds himself in Latin America hiding with no money, no comforts and no future. He gets a chance to improve his future by taking on a task that is fraught with danger and pushes his nerves to the limit. Great DVD to add to your collection.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game. I can not stop playing it. I would recommend it to anyone who asks me about it. love it, absolutely love it.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|the book is much better, it has more details which can be followed. The video has so many blank spaces so it is confusing and then it ENDS! Waste of time watching this movie!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love and adore this game it is fun and very addicting its a mini game system on portable device with different games and activities!!!!!!!!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|just so you know I got this for free but its awesome and super adicting : ) and just the way the game was destined was awsesome every thing is awesome not even force close has happens.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  Good for those who love food game. Truly a good time to be had by all
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I love Doodle God. Played it all the way through when it was just a flash game. This is even better except once I got 28 elements unlocked it started force closing everytime I tried to combine elements. Now I'm sad....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are really. simple. not to bad though I mean the game is free what do expect great way to pass the time
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|it is a lot easier than the original cut the rope. but still really fun. cant get any stars on a level in the 2nd box. but still as freaking awesome as the original.
B005LAJ23A|1.0|This review doesn't reflect the quality of the show, simply the bluray/dvd itself.  When season 1 was released I bought it immediately, only to find a few months later that a better more fleshed out bluray/dvd was released.  This appears to be happening again.  I just want AMC and whoever else is in charge of these stripped down releases to STOP doing this.  You aren't doing yourself any favors by alienating and infuriating your core audience with sub par format releases.  I will not buy this version and neither should you.  Instead, wait for the better release that will come a few months after this one.  It will show these studios that we aren't stupid and we want the best product they can give us, not this half-way product.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I do not understand the high ratings on this book unless the author (or her publisher and agent) paid 500 of her closest friends to write good reviews. The main characters are  barely sketched in, so it is impossible to feel any sort of empathy for, or interest in, their minimal strengths and their many weaknesses. In fact, the lengthy \\"contract\\" regarding the services to be rendered by both parties had more detail in it than any description of the characters. The writing is annoyingly repetitive (\\"inner goddess,\\" \\"subconscious,\\" \\"HOT!\\" \\"Oh.My.\\" with the f-word at least once per page) and the overall tone is dark, creepy, depressing and an insult to women everywhere. The female character, who seems to have the intelligence of a flea, submits herself as a slave to this obscenely selfish male, apparently because he is rich (\\"a billionaire\\") handsome, and \\"hot.\\" Would she do it if he was your average slightly paunchy, balding male with a middle-class income? I doubt it, and not only that, she would probably report his attempts to enslave her to the police. Does the author really believe that women are willing to prostitute themselves to the point of slavery and to deny their own self-worth to this extent if a male is rich enough and/or handsome enough? If so, she should seek professional help, along with both of the main characters in this book. Ick.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Like everyone else said,  just as the game starts to really get good it force closes and keeps doing it.  Fix it and this would be a 5 star app.  Less than 1 as is.
0061537969|5.0|I read this book in less than 24 hours. I couldn't put the book down. Being a local Seattle native I could picture the whole story in my head. I have never read a novel where a dog is the narrator. This book was hilarious and heartwarming at the same time. A MUST READ.
0786891416|5.0|I love this book.  I really love the Castle Series on TV, and this book is written just like the TV show. A murder mystery that has the same humor and double entendres from the characters we love already!
B005DI9906|1.0|I love this movie but I got scammed. I purchased the \\"All Regions\\" Import Dvd of this movie from a person by the name of \\"Rong Ju Montage\\" of China. Do NOT make the same mistake I made. The DVD he sent me was JUNK. I recorded a copy of this movie myself from TV many years ago. I wanted a better copy so I bought the DVD. The DVD I received was a worse copy than the one I had made myself from TV. The picture on the DVD I received was blurry and of very poor quality. The picture also quite noticeably jumped around. Again, do NOT buy any Import DVD of this movie. Otherwise you will get ripped off.
B000PH40HM|3.0|Good, not great.  I'm just writing a review because I'm watching it on Prime and that should tell you enough.  I liked it enough to watch it again, so it's not that bad of a movie.  I actually think this movie was ahead of it's time and Arnold really took a chance here.  I think Arnold over-reached here and maybe overestimated his acting skills.  I'm a big Arnold fan, but this kind of role just wasn't meant for him.  He's a great action star, but the depth of emotions the main character has to go through would have been better served by another actor.  I didn't think the story was horrible like some one star reviews state and the action was sufficient.  I just don't think it deserves a one star review, meaning it's a COMPLETE and utter failure of a movie, there are plenty of those, but this one is not.
B000ZBUY78|5.0|This was a gift for my wife, and she absolutely loves it! Arrived in one piece and was exactly as described. The nice thing about it is that it needs no battery. If momma's happy, the whole house is happy!!!!!!!!!
B006DICWUE|3.0|I got used to the melodic touches and beatiful balads on previous Nada Surf material. I'm quite dissapointed of their latest release.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game to pass the time and very unique games.  Gives you a good challenge on some of the mini games.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away...<br /><br />Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote a great sci-fi adventure story called [[ASIN:1466493283 A Princess of Mars]] that would become one of the most influential science fiction fantasy stories of the 20th century inspiring George Lucas to make the epic [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars]] franchise nearly 60 years after it. It has taken a full century for Burroughs' imaginative epic fantasy to come to life on the big screen but John Carter has arrived in theaters DOA thanks to a series of costly marketing blunders by Disney of equally epic proportions.<br /><br />Despite its numerous failures to attract an audience, director Andrew Stanton has delivered a first class epic fantasy film that brings the pages of Burroughs' highly imaginative world of Barsoom to life in living, breathing color with vibrant special effects and computer animation that could easily have become Disney's Star Wars franchise with the proper marketing muscle behind it. Unfortunately we will probably never see the further adventures of John Carter in [[ASIN:146373610X The Gods of Mars]] or [[ASIN:1466493011 Warlord of Mars]] or any of the other chronicles in Burroughs' classic pulp series because the audience for whom the film was targeted has no idea just who John Carter is and is far more excited to see this summer's Hunger Games, also based on a popular series of teenage literary novels, than a hundred year-old character from a book they've never even heard of.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest tragedy is the over-simplified title changed by Stanton himself. Who is John Carter? Why should anyone care about him?<br /><br />Well, he's Taylor Kitsch who played Gambit from [[ASIN:B001GCUO16 X-Men Origins: Wolverine]] and his co-star Lynn Collins from the same film is ideally cast as the beautiful Princess Dejah Thoris of Helium. John Carter is a confederate captain from Virginia who travels to Arizona to find gold, only to find himself astrally transported to Mars after being fatally shot by Apache Indians. There are plenty of metaphors here between the natives of both worlds that evoke Dances With Wolves and Avatar as John Carter becomes the propheseid hero and savior of Barsoom which the native Tharks call their red planet. With an inspired cast of supporting actors with Willem Dafoe as the voice of Tars Tarkas, a nine foot tall, four armed green Martian, Dafoe sounds exactly as I would have always imagined the voice of Tars Tarkas to sound like and brings the character to life with his impassioned performance. Other inspired casting choices include terrific supporting performances by Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy who are reunited again from working together in HBO's excellent series [[ASIN:B0028RXXFC Rome]] as Tardos Mors and Kantos Kan respectively. Dominic West from HBO's [[ASIN:B001FA1P1W The Wire]] also rounds out the inspired casting as the villanous Sab Than seeking the hand of the Princess of Helium to unite a planetary civil war and become its ruler.<br /><br />John Carter is filled with action, adventure, special effects, animation, heroes, villains, monsters and a princess, it has all the fundamental ingredients of a classic Disney film and is a faithful adaptation of Burroughs' novel, and Disney and Stanton have delivered a spectacular film that has fallen flat on its face as a $250 million box office disaster that is being critically compared to 1995's sci-fi flop Waterworld. It must make over $400 million just to break even, another unrealistic expectation reminiscent of 2010's [[ASIN:B004K4IZ3G Tron: Legacy]] by the foolish suits at Disney who clearly have no clue how to run the studio nor do they know anything about what they have on their hands or how to mass market their product and for that heads should roll and Disney's marketing department all deserve the grim fate that awaits them.<br /><br />As for the fate of John Carter, who knows, but all indications so far seem to imply that we may never return to the red planet on the big screen again. Fortunately the written pages of Burroughs will last forever for those of us that still remember them...<br /><br />Long live John Carter of Mars!turn to the red planet on the big screen again. Fortunately the written pages of Burroughs will last forever for those of us that still remember them...<br /><br />Long live John Carter of Mars!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|- simple interface<br />- syncs up to google fine<br />- reminders per taks works great<br />- not cluttering the UI with menus &amp; good font<br />very impressive app. Thanks
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was so happy to find a traditional solitaire game for my Kindle Fire. It is formatted perfectly for the Kindle and works very well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this app very much;  i use it all the time.  It is easy to use and it passes the time well when i get bored by waiting.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|at first I was having trouble opening it but after I updated it it worked perfectly! I love this game it is very addictive but extremely fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I do not usually like BDSM themed romance but I decided to test this one out due to the amazing sales and reviews. First, the BDSM though prominant is not the focus in this story. Instead the focus was on the development of a relationship between the damaged Mr. Gray and the stable Ms. Steel. I felt that the emotions displayed between both charaters was very real...the frustration, confusion, pleasure, and anger were all very real and to me make this book so interesting. As a person in the mental health field I was also drawn to the psychological side of Mr. Gray. His past and why he feels the need to control every aspect of his life.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book as a romance novel. It was funny, emotional, and sad. However, it is not for everyone there are thosse who will not beable to look beyond the explicit BDSM or the slightly fluffy nature of the plot...but I like a good romance novel and I love this one!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Downloaded on Kindle Fire.  I enjoy playing the game and is very easy to use.  My only issue is getting the menu up.  Not so easy.  Have to tap numerous times.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|This was fun now force closes after every combination. Worked fine for a time. Im guessing bug. Will be 4 stars if they fix it.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|I love this movie because it makes you feel. Anytime you watch a movie that makes you feel something for the characters in the story its a great movie. Tekkon Kinkreet has that gift, whether its you feeling the love the two boys share for each other or the pain they've gone through you become connected to them that when the movie ends you feel like you where right there with them. Tekkon Kinkreet is a great movie to watch and watch over and over again.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Very fun and addictive. I have had no problem with freezing. Nice app. Even better that it is free.  So so nice.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|so far lots of fun. work great on ics wifi xoom.<br /><br />kind of addicting and fun to find the matches, some make sense others don't
B00364K6YW|5.0|I HAVE THE ORIGINAL VERSION AND THIS NEW ONE IS JUST AS ENJOYABLE UNTIL...I CAME TO DISK2 WHICH CAME CRACKED. I CANNOT RETURN IT AS I LIVE OVERSEAS AND HAVE ORDERS SENT TO A MAILBOX IN MIAMI. IT WOULD COST ME MORE TO SEND IT BACK THAN PURCHASE A NEW ONE. SO I WILL REMAIN WITH MY OLD VERSION. I NORMALLY BUY SEVERAL EDITIONS OF ONE TITLE. FOR THIS TITLE: I HAVE THE 1940 OLIVIER-GARSON ONE; THE BBC VIDEO EDITION AND THE LATEST KEIRA KNIGHTLY & MATHEW MACFADYEN. I LIKE TO COMPARE THEM WITH REGARD TO COSTUMES, HOUSES AND ACTORS PLAYING THE SAME ROLES. I LOVE SEEING COLIN FIRTH WITH JENNIFER EHLE HERE AND IN THE KING'S SPEECH: TWO DIFFERENT TIMES AND ROLES.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|There is one and only one Emmylou Harris;and this collection is one of her best.Here she does her music the way that is faithful to her heartand soul.Some of her albums over the years have drifted a bit,but even then she is exceptional.I get the feeling that in this album,that she set aside all that comes with being one of the best in the business.It's not the technical stuff that modern recording studios,the producers or arrangers,the fancy or super talented bands,musicians or musicians,that are at her disposal to use,but Emmylou simply going back to her roots,and quietly and almost personally communicating her thoughts directly from her heart and soul to her listener.I remember hearing Emmylou once talking about the music today and what is wrong with it and saying something like \\"it's time to get our music out of the recording studios and back to the living rooms where it came from and belongs\\".<br /> She has accomplished excatly that in this album.I would however,like to make this comment though;and it is certainly not meant to be critical.With some of her other albums,the lyrics have been included,and I missed finding them here.<br /> I you love Emmylou and her music from her heart and soul;you want to make sure you get this gem.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book is a fantastic compilation of a variety of research studies that demonstrate some very surprising things about how we think and the types of cognitive errors that we make (and why we make them).  While my wife dismissed a lot of this book as \\"just a repackaging of research that's already been published in journal articles\\" (she's an academic), that's exactly the point here.  Kahneman does a great job of highlighting the interesting findings from various studies while still noting the rigor that went into the research studies.<br /><br />I walked away from this book with a headful of ideas about how I might approach my life differently - and that's the best praise I can give a \\"thinking\\" book like this.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is a great app. it is very convienient and all of your notes get saved to a cloud in case something happens to your information. I love it!!!!
1451648537|5.0|Maybe the term \\"page turner\\" is a cliche, but I can't think of a better term to describe this book. I was engrossed in it from the beginning, even when there were times when I found Steve Jobs behavior to be repugnant. Like him or hate him, this book is both an amazing character study of a very brilliant and eccentric person and a history of how technology has advanced over the last few decades. One of the things I found interesting about this book, is that Jobs does not fit the profile of the successful American business man. Studies of the Myers Briggs have shown that most executives are very decisive, extroverted and base their decisions more on facts and numbers than on intuition. That doesn't necessarily mean those traits are always a good thing, but they are traits our society rewards. Steve Jobs did not make quick decisions and move on, he obsessed over every detail and made decisions after looking at many alternatives and different points of view. He also was not essentially extroverted and he relied quite a bit on his intuition.<br /><br />While I was reading the book, I heard someone say to me in a work situation \\"the perfect is the enemy of the good\\". A term used when people get so stuck in trying to create perfection that they sabotage themselves. But aiming for the perfect was what Steve Jobs was all about and what makes people have so much passion for the Apple brand.<br /><br />As I neared the end, I thought about how people's best traits can sometimes be their worst traits. Steve Jobs was an individualist in everything he did. He was not about to follow authority. This trait made him an extraordinary success in business. But I also can't help wondering if it also didn't ultimately lead to his early death. I had originally thought that Steve Jobs had typical pancreatic cancer which is deadly and which almost no one survives from. Turns out that he had a much less aggressive type of pancreatic cancer (unusual) which was caught early and considered highly treatable. He chose not to have the cancer removed through typical surgery and went for alternative treatments. He finally had surgery almost a year after the cancer was found, but it had by then spread in his body. It could have been he would have died anyway -- we have no way of knowing. But I can't help wondering that if in the instance of his cancer, a more oridinary man who have just followed the recommendations of his doctor, had the surgery and would have survived. Genuis in technology does not mean you are also a genuis when it comes to making medical decisions for yourself.<br /><br />Back now to the quality of the book. I think Isaacson is the best biographer around. He looks at his subject from so many angles and covers an immense amount of information that is put together in a seamless way. One of the best biographies I have ever read. Loved Einstein and his Universe also.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|At first I was a little worried when all the reviews said it force closed all the time. I must have gotten the game after the update because it runs great. Never had any problems and it's so much fun! Very addicting.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I download the game because I was in an airport waiting on a flight. Made the time fly by fast.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|Sorry but this version lost me from the moment young Jane says to Helen Burns at Lowood \\"how do we get out of here?\\" and Helen says \\"we advertise\\"!. The screenplay  is awful.  The changes dont make much sense . There was no reason that Jane as an adult couldnt have figured out how to advertise her services herself as she does in the book and then to sacrfice the real conversations between Helen and Jane which help form her character. I literally laughed out loud in the scene when Rochester comes home and shouts get away from me ! witch! ! Really? That made him seem completely ridiculous and not fanciful or fun but paranoid and superstitious.  I have seen many versions of Jane Eyre. Rochester in this movie ocmes off more obnoxious than charming ....Michael Fassbender was much better.  The way he talks about Adele is extremely obnoxoius....he doesnt talk about her in such dispaaraging terms int eh book even when he pushes her away.  I dont feel any chemistry between the leads either. I would even recommend the Charltote Gainsbourgh version, which had many flawas as well, over this one.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|This album was a great purchase at an affordable price. It's tough to find Kid Rock music for download so Amazon is the perfect choice.

B005LAJ23A|4.0|This season is hard to rate especially when you love it and zombies generally, as much as I do. Season two definetlley doesn't hold up to the first in terms of zombies and action. It was more story based which is perfectly fine but at the same time some moments felt like they just dragged on and it got a little \\"soap opera-e\\". This season though, started strong and ended strong regardless of the slowness. I'm looking forward to whats to come in the third season and hoping this season was just a sophmore slump. Every show has at least one season that doesn't fit the calibur of others so i'll be buying this to add to my collection and eagerly wait for for October 2012. Also I'd like to say that my 4 star rating also reflects the fact that this BD verion is $50!! Not bad for a show, right? This season is only 12 episodes! Are they crazy? Any other show for $50 would have at least 22 episodes on it...
B006WPSQVC|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies that highlights the importance of being a father, not just a sperm donor, but a real father. There is a Christian theme through the movie, so if this is a turn off to you, it may not be the movie for you. I can say this was an excellent movie.
B007JRU4N0|5.0|We were skeptical about watching this because we thought it would be too depressing.  Although it does have sad and disturbing segments, we thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was one of the best films we've seen in recent years.  The screenplay is very well written.  The actors are well cast.  Finally, George Clooney, who we normally have our doubts about, was masterful.  Anyone who has gone through the child raising process will relate to this film.
B004OYUNTG|4.0|This is a very nice watch.  I'm so happy I made this choice.  My number one choice was a little too expensive for me but I needed a watch that had a timer, more than one alarm, timer, countdown and its waterproof.  I like the different city options.  It's a very nice looking watch and everyone thinks I paid much more for it than I did.  I don't give it 5 stars for only two reasons...the light function is a kind of yellowish that really does not help when you need to see the time at night.  The second reason is that it should have been backlit, meaning the digital time display should have been made a little brighter - then I would have given it 5+ stars :).  Aside from that, it is a really great looking watch with great functionality.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Works perfectly on my kindle fire. Easy to play and it fun. I played for about 10 minutes after I got this app.  Love it!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Worked perfectly the first time I was playing.  Now it loads and force closes so now I can't play. Hope it gets fixed bc then I would love it.  Fun to spend down time playing if it works.
B005HITRDG|5.0|This book pulled at my heart strings , and left me in suspense till the end. The love story between Sam and grace , is unconditional and consistent till the end. Maggie has done a wonderful job and continues to inspire.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game is awful and needs to be worked on. I think they need to take out their plus 20 sign.
1932100660|3.0|The book is difficult to read if you don't know much about science and research.  Way too in depth for me.  Need to get to the point faster and just tell me the suggested regimen and how to implement.
0439023491|4.0|I was so excited to read Catching Fire after reading The Hunger Games and it only disappointed with the ending. The characters became a bit deeper and changed due to their experiences. And the kind of society they lived in was painted more vividly in this book versus the first.<br />The only reason it's a 4 out of 5 is the ending that just drops you and requires that, if you are really into the trilogy, you have to buy Mockingjay. I literally laughed out loud during a few segments and cried as well. But I growled \\"Are you kidding me?!\\" when I read-end of book two.
B00402FGEE|5.0|Not sure why all the good sci-fi's of the last several years have been cancelled. Firefly, Enterprise, Caprica, Defying Gravity, and too many lesser knowns to name (like \\"Surface\\" and \\"Harsh Realm\\"). I had never even heard of Defying Gravity until it was three years old. My buddy, also a die-hard trekker, had never heard of DG either (and he doesn't like SGU - I have no idea why, probably because he's an a**hole)). Maybe their not getting enough exposure, or we'll just have to create iTV so it's consumer driven again.<br /><br />SGU was another one that really let me down by being cancelled. It had great potential to unfold, the story is so awesome no matter how you slice it. It's a great premise, entirely seperate from SG1, or the 'gay-show' Atlantis (Tosh coined it, don't get mad at me).<br /><br />An ancient ship launched from Earth a million years ago, by humans. Staying alive is a daily challenge and getting home unlikely. Great start. There were a few moments when I thought the show got too corny and akward (like the intelligent creature that is hunting them on a planet that they stop at, not really SGU calibre). But many more, very good stories, like the episode \\"Twin Destinies\\" - got sci-fi down to it's truest form, and delivered.<br /><br />These actors were phenomenal (except Young's wife on Earth, she was awful, just FF through part of the fourth episode and don't look back). The soundtracks were really well done too, I thought. Meaningful, and deep music, definitely not normal for any tv show. Bear McCreary is not singing \\"Don't forget to breathe\\" and creating awesome acoustics. The stories too, were so much more interesting than just fighting the Goa-uuuuld or the Ori. Don't get me wrong, SG1 was a fantastic show for it's time and worthy of those two extra seasons, but just doesn't compare to the potential this show had. I enjoy metaphors and stories, and this show delivered times ten. It was probably too good for it's own survival. too heady, too many BIG words, and absent situational comedy of large Americans. I don't get it. Caprica, Firefly, DG, it's painful that not enough people could keep it alive. Battlestar, Thank God, recieved four perfect seasons and required no more. SGU could have easily done the same.<br /><br />A side note: these ideas should be explored, for their entertainment and their history. Something happened on Earth long ago. The pyramids at Giza and all their astronomical oddities, topological metaphors and geometry of ancient cities (several on the planet suggest they were connected somehow), and the dozens, if not hundreds of cities that have been found under water, pre-dating the known timeline for humans to have been living together socially (over 12,000 years ago). The book \\"Forbidden Archeology\\" by Cremo should at least give someone pause to the generally accepted history. Something is out of place, and though SGU is probably a far cry from any reality, it's FUN.BIG words, and absent situational comedy of large Americans. I don't get it.

B001RT89TC|4.0|I remember buying this way back when it came out on vinyl back in '82. I also remember being disappointed in this album back then. Now I know why. I was disappointed that Gary Barden wasn't the vocalist anymore.<br /><br />Well, I took a chance and purchased this remaster and I really enjoyed this CD. Quality musicianship and Bonnett's vocals are really good. Just goes to show what a little age does to you. One can rediscover things that they previously thought wasn't all that good.

0756407125|3.0|Let's start with the obvious. These books by Rothfuss are way too long. There is a need to have vast portions of this book cut out. What were the editors thinking? The story line involving Denna, Kvothe's lady friend, could have taken a good hit. There are endless chapters that go nowhere when these two characters are together. I lost track of how many times that Denna did a runner on Kvothe.<br /><br />There is a decent plot buried in this enormous novel. Most readers will have to dig deep in order to find it. I had to skip many pages in order to get to some interesting sections of the book. I am sure others feel the same way. Let's hope book three will be tighter and shorter and hopefully a better book.

Although later stages I found myself relying on hints more often than im typically comfortable with. I'm not sure if I like this or Alchemy better. They're almost identical in concept but quite different in execution. Both are worth trying out.<br /><br />At first, I too had the issues with crashing around element 50 or so, but luckily it was swiftly updated and runs just fine on my g2x now.

Yes, it is a bit trashy, some of the situations and characters are hard to believe, but overall, it was a fantastic and gripping story.  There is a huge element of BDSM is the story, but it's not the main focus.  To me, it was a modern, more sexually detailed version of the typical romance novel.  I enjoyed it immensely and quickly purchased (and read) the subsequent books in the trilogy.
6305922756|5.0|After all these years, this rocku-mocku-documentary holds fascination for so many people, and why not?  Under the direction of Rob Reiner, this dry little film takes on some brilliantly satirical moments in real British rock groups' histories and twists them so that you get the jokes with fictitious group Spinal Pap--er, Tap--and the results are still as funny as they were when the movie came out in the early 80s.<br /><br />They once were known as the Originals, but somebody else had the name the Original, so they changed their name to the New Originals...lol.  And who can forget all the drummers that somehow died mysteriously, bad gigs, nobody showing up at a record signing, and getting lost backstage?  A favorite moment is when bassist Derek Smalls (obviously living up to his last name), is forced to pull a foil wrapped cucumber out of his pants during an airport inspection.  \\"We've got armadillos in our trousers,\\" eh?<br /><br />David's girlfriend Janine Pettibone is an unlikeable Yoko Ono rock girlfriend who starts a huge rift between Nigel and David a la Paul and John, and let's not forget that \\"Stone'enge was in danger of being crushed by dwarves.\\"  All this, and some very funny songs like \\"Big Bottom\\" and \\"Sex Farm Woman\\" are merely the icing on the cake as a washed-up band tries repeatedly to make a comeback any way they can.  Full of goofy clothes that hit too close to home, outrageous dialogue, and an inevitable reunion, this movie is nonstop fun for the rocker in us all. A definite keeper, this movie \\"goes to 11.\\"
B0068MNO4S|2.0|This movie isn't remotely accurate. But that's ok. It clearly isn't trying to be. Where it does fall down is that it isn't even believable. Nor is it thrilling. It's plodding and dull. I went in hoping that it would either be ridiculously bad or decently good, but it falls somewhere in the middle which makes it surprisingly unmemorable. It is however, at least original.<br /><br />What's quietly infuriating about this movie is Roland Emmerich's apparent desire to tear down the English. Shakespeare is a buffoon. That's to be expected from the very premise. But did they have to make Elizabeth an incompetent too? As a young woman she acts like a horny high schooler. She sleeps with everyone and has had several bastards which somehow nobody noticed despite her highly public position. She displays no evidence of nobility and simply acts like one of the girls. She is also under the control of William Cecil, the arch-villian of the piece. As an old woman she fares no better, suffering from dementia or at least deteriorating mentally. And do we really need tales of incest as well? At no point does she display any trace of class. In fact, the only character who does display this is De Vere, and he's the one that everyone keeps berating for not following his (ill-defined) role as a nobleman. The Cecils do display a bit of this, but they're so cartoonishly evil that it never really sticks. Between this, the scene of the British burning villagers to death in [[ASIN:B000O19EW0 The Patriot]], and the unnecessary scene of Queen Elizabeth II walking her dogs onto the escape ship in [[ASIN:B0035G0U2O 2012]] I'm detecting a real pattern here.<br /><br />Emmerich really doesn't get Shakespeare at all. Everything that Shakespeare wrote served one fixed political purpose? It doesn't take a literary critic to see that that makes no sense. His use of the plays for political ends displays only the most superficial examples. For example, Polonius from Hamlet is dressed like William Cecil. Therefore his getting stabbed is a strike against Cecil. My only question is this: How? How does dressing a character up as a political figure count as making a political point? Polonius wasn't one of Shakespeare's arch-villains (Robert Cecil gets a much better one in Richard III), he was just a somewhat crafty man assisting the king. So what was the implication of it? There's nothing damaging to Cecil's reputation there, and the only reason that there is any connection made is because of the costuming. Which isn't anything to do with the written play at all. He could have dressed anyone up as Cecil and it would have had the same effect is what I gather. So that means the choice of \\"Shakespeare's\\" plays is unnecessary. They could have used anyone. And watching a play wherein the villain looks like a famous figure is reliably going to provoke a riot calling for his overthrow? Really? How dumb does he think people are? If somebody digitally placed Obama's head on Hitler's body could we expect the same reaction here?<br /><br />A really confusing aspect of this film is its tendency to switch between modern and Elizabethan English at the drop of a hat and for no reason. It's like they remember to match the tone of the plays only occasionally and then ad lib the rest. Another confusing feature is how they keep switching back and forth in time. The only way to keep track is to spot the younger actors playing the part. Not always easy to tell in all those elaborate costumes.<br /><br />So the good points: Rhys Ifans is excellent as Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He's pretty much the only character who manages to be interesting and sympathetic. While they never give him any motivation or insight (being a genius is considered enough of an explanation apparently) he does at least come off well. Also coming off pretty well (or at least entertaining) is Rafe Spall as Shakespeare. He's a pathetic, greedy little man and it is immensely fun. Apart from them and a brief introduction by Derek Jacobi (performing the same role he did better in Henry V) the acting in this film is uniformly horrible. The look of the city is superb and manages to capture a good deal of the griminess that most films manage to leave out while still maintaining a sense of scale. It was very nice to see London Bridge rendered in beautiful CGI. Also, some of the staging (although stolen from better films) wasn't too bad. But apart from these fairly minor points the movie has nothing to offer. You're better off seeing [[ASIN:B00001U0E1 Shakespeare in Love]] or one of the many films based off his plays. This one offers a fresh idea, but cannot decide whether it is a realistic drama or an over-the-top spectacle. Either one would be fine, but this film never commits.n by Derek Jacobi (performing the same role he did better in Henry V) the acting in this film is uniformly horrible.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|When my son received his Kindle for Christmas, the first books he wanted was the Hunger Games Series. I bought them for him and he had them read before he returned to school from Christmas holidays. Then a couple of months ago, we had a Parent/Teacher conference and the teacher was talking about all of the kids wanting to read the series and how she could never keep the books in her library in her room. It made me curious to read a book that was so exciting to this age of child. I have to say, it was one of the best written books I have ever read. Suzanne Collins is a brilliant writer and I am looking forward to reading other books written by her.

B0012GMWCU|5.0|Had this on vinyl back in 1969 or 1970 (maybe both?).  Wore it out.  Listened to this and \\"Electric Mud\\" by Muddy Waters about a gazillion times. Got into Willie Dixon through Led Zeppelin. They covered 2 of his songs on their first album (\\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\").  I remember reading the credits on that record, and wondered who Willie Dixon was.  \\"Maybe he's the bass player,\\" said my friend Steve.  Soon afterward, I found this album at Tower Records in San Francisco.  Boy, was i in for an awakening!!!<br /><br />While Dixon wrote all the songs on this album, they were all originally recorded by other Chess Records artists.  Dixon's main talent was as a songwiter and producer extraodinaire at Chess Records in Chicago, but he also sang and played a mean stand up bass.  On this album, he sings his own songs for once, and shows himself to be a more than capable vocalist.<br /><br />It begins with \\"Back Door Man,\\" which I had 1st heard covered by the Doors on their debut album, and had been a hit for Howlin' Wolf a couple years before that. Absolute classic blues! \\"The Seventh Son\\" was covered by Johnny Rivers about 1967, and originally recorded by Willie Mabon. \\"Spoonful\\" was a monster hit for Eric Clapton and Cream.  \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" was originally a hit for Howlin' Wolf and covered by the Jeff Beck group with Rod Stewart in 1968.  \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" is my favorite Willie Dixon song and probably his best song.  It was recorded originally by Muddy Waters in 1954, and covered by every blues band in existence since then.  \\"The Little Red Rooster\\"  was originally done by Howlin Wolf in the 60s, and \\"the Same Thing\\" was done by Muddy Waters in the early 60s.  And of course, \\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" are also aboard this album. In fact, \\"You Shook Me\\" (originally recorded by Muddy Waters) was covered by Jeff Beck almost year before Led Zeppelin recorded it.<br /><br />If you really want to know about the blues, get this album. Also check out the Willie Dixon Chess Box; that has the original recorded versions of Willie Dixon's songs.lso check out the Willie Dixon Chess Box; that has the original recorded versions of Willie Dixon's songs.

1416596585|5.0|There are few things one can have recognized just about anywhere on the planet. Coca Cola is one. Google is another. This book traces the history of the Internet search Goliath, from its beginnings as a college research project through its exit from China and leadership change earlier this year. Levy offers insight few have had before, nor been allowed to share publicly.<br /><br />Steven Levy is a senior writer for Wired and past technology writer for Newsweek. Over his years of covering the tech industry, he has gained the trust of some of the most tight-lipped CEOs, including Steve Jobs and, in this case, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the whiz-kid founders of Google. Levy provides a view inside the walls of Google and explains who they are, why they do what the do and how they think.<br /><br />He begins by explaining the Google business model, revealing the revenue engine that allows the company to do incredible things. I was entranced by this explanation. For the first time, I understand how Google Adwords works, the heuristics behind the search engine and what makes them unique in the market. Levy beautifully explains some of the most complex Internet concepts that have eluded me for years. I can see how Google can afford to appear to give everything away. Services like Gmail, Google Docs, Blogger, Voice and Picasa, while free, all drive the same model of providing advertisers the unique ability to know a very specific audience and target the \\"more likely to buy\\" than ever before.<br /><br />Levy goes on to explain the many paths Google has trod, including their legendary hiring practice (always hire above the median intelligence), how engineers rule the company (salesmen struggle to survive) and how Page and Brin built a culture that thrives on innovation and special projects. While many companies may try to copy their techniques, without the unique personalities of Page and Brin, I would venture to say it won't work outside of the Googleplex.<br /><br />Much has been made of the \\"Don't be evil\\" mission statement of Google. Levy explains how it came to be (it wasn't intended to ever be known outside the company) and how, now that is out in public, it is used as a bludgeon anytime Google does something someone doesn't like. Who decides what is evil? That would be Sergei and Larry. After reading he book, I am more unsettled on this than before. Their lens of morality is very different than mine. They believe in a much more liberal sense of public good than I do. They don't have a problem with sacrificing personal privacy for the \\"greater good.\\" They are perplexed when someone disagrees with them on issues such as Google scanning mail in order to provide more relevant ads. Resistance to scanning and indexing all the books in the world caught them completely off guard. They couldn't understands why authors didn't like the idea. Even while the lawsuits are pending, they continue to scan books at an ever increasing rate.<br /><br />The stories about Page and Brin have left me more than a little concerned about them at the helm of one of the world's largest and most powerful companies. They do not like oversight or people telling them what they can or cannot do. They act like spoiled children, warping morality to their own way of seeing the world. Opposing views are not to be investigated, but dismissed as naive. They keep their investors in the dark, sometimes refusing to answer questions stockholder meetings. \\"If they only understood...\\" is a phrase to commonly used.<br /><br />Levy offers a fair and unbiased opinion of Google's actions. He details Google's most controversial exploits, including their compliance with censorship in China, laying out the story and the facts that drove their decisions. He leaves it to the reader to decide if Google is the victim or the evil on in these cases. This unbiassed approach is very appreciated by me in today's world of tabloid expos&eacute;s.<br /><br />Have I cancelled my gmail account?Not yet. I still use Google products because they are simple and easy to use. Will I change at some point down the road? Perhaps. I am still pondering that decision. I trust Google less after reading this fascinating book. I just don't know who else I could trust to not be evil.et. I still use Google products because they are simple and easy to use.

0439023483|3.0|I read this book straight through in one shot. The story was pretty compelling, I liked the characters, and it was pretty well written.<br /><br />That said, it had a few issues. I noticed some weird editing problems, for instance, on at least one occasion there was a shift of tense in the middle of a page.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with the book is that it just left me feeling unsatisfied. I can't say too much without spoilers, but they build up this big tension between the Capital and the characters, and it just sort of ends leaving those threads hanging, and on a down note, even.<br /><br />I will be reading the second book. I'm sure that the way the book ends is because it's meant to head into the sequel, but I'm a believer that books in a series should stand on their own, while building into the larger arc. I don't believe the author was successful in this - it likely stands strong in the series as a whole, but without the other books it suffers.<br /><br />All in all, reading it was an okay use of my evening.<br /><br />As a side note, while the violence isn't described in detail, these are kids ranging from 12ish to 17ish forced to kill each other. They do die, and the author does make it so that (at least some) of the deaths aren't just \\"oh, he died, moving along, now). It's probably not for younger audiences, content wise, while the writing is aimed at that level. You may at least want to read it first, to be sure. I have no problem with violence (indeed, I've read MUCH more graphic and violent books), and the violence did not detract from the book, but it's something to be aware of if you want your kid to read it.

B003Y5H5B0|4.0|No, wait, that isn't it. There is something comendable when stupid dialogue is well-written. Few can do it but when they can, look out. I generally don't like vulgarity in my art but when it's done right, it's fantastic (see Kingpin). These two cops are more Felix and Oscar than they are Starsky and Hutch. Or Hansen and Hoffs, in this case. The whole movie is a joke, from its' premise, to being a recycled idea to obvious adults posing as teens and the screenwriters know it and keep it as running gags throughout.<br /><br />Channing Tatum. I like Tatum and always have. I know I'm not getting Olivier when I watch his movies but he has a nice, easy-going charm that I find appealing. Hill, on the other hand, I've never cared for. I have yet to see Moneyball so perhaps that will be the film that turns me.<br /><br />It's funny, it's vulgar, it's absurd.

B000WAEJZ0|5.0|In 2007 Arista Records was waiting patiently for another record from Whitney Houston after she signed what was then the biggest recording deal in United Staes history: in 2000 she signed with the label for a $100,000,000 recording contract. However, as many know the 2000's was not a good decade for \\"The Voice\\" as by 2007 she had only released one new studio album (\\"Just Whitney\\" in 2002) and a Holiday collection the following year. So to please Whitney's fan base Arista released this \\"greatest hits\\" CD in Europe to appease her huge international audience.<br /><br /> The record contains pretty much all her biggest hits, opening with the Dolly Parton power ballad \\"I Will Always Love You\\" (both Dolly and Whitney's signature song and recently called \\"the greatest love song of all-time\\") as well as the other songs Whitney is known for. \\"Saving All My Love\\", \\"Didn't We Almost Have It All\\", \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\" and others appear here. Personally if you have already purchased Whitney's \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD from 2000 there really isn't any reason to buy this as there are no new tracks or bonus songs.<br /><br /> After Whitney passed away in February, 2012 \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" saw huge record sales and sold more copies this time around than it had upon its initial release.

B004FOA84A|3.0|While not terribly compelling, Secret of Grisly Manor (SoGM)contains interesting visuals and challenging gameplay.  There is very little story which is a no-no for a game this visually adept.  I wouldn't mind seeing this expanded upon in the future.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|When I started reading this, I had already seen both \\"Dragon Tatoo\\" movies (Swedish and American) and was intrigued by what the screenwriters had omitted. I have previously found that most films based on a book or books are definately eclipsed by the written word as plots and charactors are greatly more in depth and the cutting room floor gets a lot of the fillers.<br /><br />The style of writing is not the same as works written in English as it is translated from the Author's native tongue of Swedish. Also, as the books' setting is Sweden, the culture and laws are differing from America and take a little adjustment mentally. I found the books a little hard to get involved in until I adjusted to the style and nuances . . . however, I found the effort worth it. By the time I had finished the first of the Trilogy, I could not or did not want to put it down and each books added flavor and want to read more. By the time I was mid-way in the second book, I was researching the author for further works and found I was out of luck to my disappointment.<br /><br />All of the above is simply to state, I would recommend these books individually in print or in Kindle version (single work or bundled together) to any reader who is willing to read for a while to allow the plots and charactors to develop  . . . if you are such a person and like a good suspensful, mindbending, twisty read, I think this is one not to miss (by the way, you need to read all three to appreciate the first - they build on each other.<br /><br />I rated these five stars only because it would not allow six stars.<br /><br />Bill Wade<br />Virginia
B0073LWEXK|4.0|The Lost City is certainly a major improvement over Secret of Grisly Manor.  The story is a bit more flushed out and the gameplay more detailed.  The visuals were outright beautiful and the soundtrack actually lulled me to sleep a couple of times.  The only problem I have is that they did not include any sort of fast travel system.  All too often, an object that you sound on one screen can only be used all the way on the other \\"side.\\"  There are over forty screens and to have to keep clicking backtrack all the time gets warned out some of the time.  I'd like to see more games like this one though.
1250006341|5.0|This beautiful book is just the thing for all fans of \\"Downton Abbey.\\" The photos are outstanding, and the text is intelligent and informative. The only jarring photos are those showing the scenes being filmed, with microphones hovering over the actors. One can learn a great deal about the period in which the show takes place, and it is all fascinating.
0156027321|4.0|Highly recommended by a friend, Life of Pi is a breezy fun read, full of adventure and rich descriptions of wild animals. (I'm assuming well-researched.) It's the story of a sensitive 16-year old son of a zookeeper in Pondicherry, India who dabbles in Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. He finds good in each of them seeing them as not mutually exclusive. His three mentors see it otherwise and are convinced of his undying devotion to each by virtue of their assumptions, not by anything Pi has said. (Perhaps this is a bit disingenuous. Pi always told the truth to each religious leader but not the whole truth of his experimentations; he saw no need to). They are shocked to learn that he has been trying the other religions on for size and argue amongst themselves over Pi's loyalties.<br /><br />The story then changes direction. The family decides to move to Canada, taking the whole family and their zoo. But the Japanese freighter on which they're traveling, wrecks and sinks (we know not how) and Pi ends up on a lifeboat with a hyena, a seasick orangutan, a wounded zebra and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The hyena, zebra and orangutan ultimately don't fare so well. Fortunately, the boat has enough supplies for 26 people and Pi industriously figures out how to stay alive for 227 days adrift on the Pacific Ocean with a 450-pound tiger. Some great thinking here--Pi has to feed Richard Parker, keep him alive, because he is physically unable to kill him and he doesn't dare let him get hungry or young Pi becomes lunch. There is an exciting respite on a floating island full of meerkats but it's all a harrowing experience with Pi detailing his thoughts and his plans, occasionally muddled by hallucinations. (Meerkats are South African varmints that look like a cross between a mongoose and a prairie dog. I saw some at the Toledo, Ohio zoo just prior to reading the book. There was a sign that said, \\"Meerkats are not prairie dogs.\\")<br /><br />The ending is where the point of this romp is brought home. Pi, saved on the coast of Mexico, tells the Japanese owners of the ship what happened. They think he's lying or crazy so he tells them a completely different version of the wreck and his wild journey across the sea. Pi is saying to them, pick the story you like best, whatever helps bring it to closure, whatever works for your happiness. The reader is thus forced to question the events and their ultimate meaning. Get it? The truth and meaning of any story is open to question.<br /><br />Early in the novel, a character calls it \\"a story that will make you believe in God.\\" I don't think so. I don't believe it would be enough to change the mind of any solid atheist secure in his or her position. This is more for the mercurial spiritualist who has an affinity for syncretism. Philosophically, this is another effort to advance the theme of religious relativity. The individual defines what is truth, defines God--whatever floats your boat.<br /><br />From the perspective of reading it as an entertaining novel, I found it well written and wonderfully imaginative. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's one of those books I couldn't put down.his romp is brought home. Pi, saved on the coast of Mexico, tells the Japanese owners of the ship what happened.

1401923127|4.0|I read Lipton's book after finding EFT through Dr. Mercola. I had already used the techniques in the Emotion Codes and the Healing Codes. Both had been helpful for me. I have found EFT to be the most powerful of those techniques. However, I had a problem with all of the \\"energy psychology\\" techniques because they required my agnostic scientist mind to suspend disbelief in favor of \\"woo-woo.\\" This book has resolved that conflict. I gave it 4 stars, though, for the reasons some other reviewers did, which is that the book's promise of showing someone how to reprogram the subconscious is not fulfilled. I have not used Pysch K and can not speak to its efficacy. I have used the Emotion Codes, which is essentially free other than the small cost of the book, and I have used the Healing Codes, also essentially free other than the small cost of the book. The Healing Codes is a very good value as there is a website to which any purchaser of the book is given access on which there is a substantial amount of support material, and there are weekly phone calls that are free that people can participate in as well. Both were very helpful to me, but after reading this book, I am able to use EFT in a much more intentional and directed way than I was able to use either one of the other two techniques, because now I understand exactly what it is that I am working to get at and change. Lipton's book gave me the pieces of the puzzle I was missing to make the energy psychology techniques work even more powerfully than they had worked for me up to that point. There are several books on EFT that come up on Amazon, including one in the For Dummies series. I have not read any of them and can not speak to them, but I see very high reviews for many of them. If you run a search the EFTFree website will come up, and there is free material on the website. You may also be fortunate enough to be close to one of the EFT Masters to get a couple of private sessions or take one of the classes, or at least one of them I am aware of offers monthly teleconferences for the cost of $7. Lipton's book will support and enhance the efficacy of any of the energy psychology techiques you choose. His website also lists several different modalities, not just Psych K. If one doesn't work, try another one until you find what works for you to heal mind and body. This book is an excellent explanation of the biological basis of why any of those techniques work, which in turn strengthens the likelihood that something will in fact work for you.

0375812024|5.0|I bought this book for my then 2 year old son to take on an airplane trip ( like every other parent!) This was our first Richard Scarry book ever (yes for me too). Now we are hooked for life. My son is now 3 and we have read it so many times that the book is falling apart. There are so many small details that can be picked up by kids every time the book is opened. This is a great book and I learned a lot about airports myself from this one.
B0068FYZZW|5.0|Okay so I've been putting off buying this movie for a LONG LONG time... it'll be replacing a well worn (and rightfully so) VHS...<br /><br />I thoroughly love the online reviewing world and trust their judgement on many many many things that I choose to purchase or not... given this I became utterly infuriated at the poor reviews representing this particular copy of BFC as they represented everything that is WRONG with the online reviewing community...<br /><br />So here I go... for better or worse (and in this case... better and better)<br /><br />The breakdown...<br /><br />FIRST OFF! I'll note i purchased this at wal-mart because its actually cheaper!!??!?!?!? than amazon... i picked it up for $11.99 which is a legit steal for everything provided...<br /><br />Packaging: Nothing special... standard blu-ray affair with a cardboard cover overlay... I will note that the permanent plastic under the overlay that protects the cover-insert is horridly warped with a ripple effect... may bother hardcore people but... there really should be a higher end version of this movie for those people anyway...<br /><br />Contents: Good stuff here... this is in fact TWO discs... not like some of the old-school HD DVD/DVD Combos... there is a full fledged DVD movie and a full fledged Blu-ray Disc... PERFECT!!!! it may just be an annoyance to me but I hate double sided discs for many many reasons...<br /><br />DA BLU-RAY (AKA Why you're here!!!) :<br /><br />Quality to me is impeccable... I think some people forget how old these classics are... we're talking about resurrecting film that is ages old and expecting it to be Avatar (or whatever) quality...

I'm watching it right now on a 55\\" DLP 1080p with my PS3 and 7.1 - and no I'm not bragging or anything, just stating for peoples own reference - and in my opinion its pretty excellent...

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As my title suggests, this is a captivating ending to the series.  All three books are quick reads.  This is a young adult series, so I wouldn't expect more.  For me, it was a needed break from George R. R. Martin, and a delightful one at that.<br /><br />Spoiler alert - the author is anti-war.  She uses the book as a way to express those beliefs.  I see nothing wrong with that.  I don't base my belief system on the library of fiction books I've read.  It's just entertainment.  There are 2 types of people - those who see war as a necessary evil and those who see war as just evil.  From reading this series, I would gather that the author is the latter type.  Both sides can argue points till blue in the face.  Don't bother.  If anything, just read for the entertainment and for the chance to experience something thought provoking.<br /><br />More spoilers - The characters do change.  Katnass is obviously emotionally wrecked, and some may think she becomes less endearing.  I couldn't blame her after reflecting on what she has been through.  Rather than focusing on her character and what made me like her from the start, I found myself thinking more of the external forces that could change someone so drastically.  And I enjoyed that.  The final straw that led to the unraveling of Kat was seeing Prim burned alive.  Prim was the sole being that Kat cared for the most and devoted herself to protecting.  By that time, I would expect her to become a shell of her former self.  Same applies to the other characters.  Some complain that Gale and Peeta are pretty much absent in the third book, either emotionally or literally.  Well, Gale was never a charming person to begin with.  He just provided a side story to Kat's life....a parallel path that could be taken.  But it was really left up to the reader's imaginatin.  Although noble and dutiful, he had a temper and wasn't the best communicator. Seeing more or less of him didn't make a difference to me, since the author hadn't focused on him much to begin with.  The reader has to remember that this book is written in the 1st person, so if Kat was thrown into more situations with Gale, then we would have seen more of him.  It just wasn't the intention.  Peeta on the other hand is a huge part of the series, but is pretty much absent for the third book.  There is a reason, and this reason lends itself to the story.  Peeta was tortured and \\"hijacked\\" by the brutal, sadistic Capitol.  The role he played to get Kat to where she was by the third book had run it's course.  The Author redirected the reader to look forward through Kat's eyes to the main theme.  This is not a love story.  It's a story about the emotional and physical pain that war inflicts, as the Author wants the reader to see it.<br /><br />Without reading any industry reviews or interviews with the author, I got the feeling that the book was written in a way that would lend itself to a movie.  As I progressed toward the end, there were parts that I felt were rushed and skipped, but I didn't mind because I felt that the characters were developed well enough to get away with it.  The final battle is quick and the writing flows like a movie script.  But it's powerful.

B0072X2NUS|5.0|There are three electronica bands that matter. By matter, I mean were THE game changers. Kraftwerk. Depeche Mode. Orbital. Are there other great electronic bands? Absolutely. But these three set the stage for everything that followed. Vince and Martin have pulled off something exciting and fresh here. And exceedingly analog sounding. Much darker than Vince's outlet with Erasure and more uptempo than Martin's outlet with Depeche Mode. These guys founded Depeche Mode. They matter. And this album demonstrates that from its opening salvo.

014241543X|4.0|\\"I realize now that dying is easy. Living is hard.\\" (Forman 146)<br /><br />Unique and touching, Mia's journey is an emotional ride that readers everywhere will find pulling at their heartstrings. Mia, cellist and essential good-girl to the core, finds herself standing on the sidelines of a car accident -- her family's car accident. From this moment to the hospital, I realized that Forman truly did a wonderful job with this beginning stage. It could have easily been over or under-done, but it was perfectly effective and heartbreaking. The rollercoaster of emotions that Mia goes through while witnessing everything from the side is realistic and touching. Each flashback of her life before this moment provides a good source of depth to every character and Mia's life, really showing how much she has to lose if things don't work out.<br /><br />It's easy to get caught up in Forman's words and compare Mia's story to your own life - What if that was me? What if there was nothing I could do but watch my life unravel? I wasn't expecting such a thoughtful story that really pulled me in emotionally - I was up, down and really diving into Mia's hectic life. If I Stay can be described and summed up into one word - memorable.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS: If I Stay is written so beautifully and poignantly. I knew going into this story that would be sad, and it was, but there's so much more to the words than I expected. I loved how the relationship between Mia and Adam wasn't easily begun, because they really are different people with unique likes/dislikes. And the \\"play me\\" scene? Hot.<br /><br />LOWLIGHTS: There were a couple times when I questioned some of the words \\"Mia\\" would use - they didn't seem to match her voice quite right, but these moments were rare. Also a few moments where the story was pushed a bit too hard, and some of these moments could have been more touching if they'd been reigned in a bit.<br /><br />COVER: Love the new look, but I have to respectfully disagree with the quotation on the new paperback cover - this novel is very different from Twilight, and that comparison does not suit the story's style. I think fans of [[ASIN:159514188X Thirteen Reasons Why]] or [[ASIN:0061726818 Before I Fall]] will love this book, because those stories better match the subject and writing style.the quotation on the new paperback cover - this novel is very different from Twilight, and that comparison does not suit the story's style.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I watched the series on HBO and loved it, so decided to purchase it on Blu-Ray.  The picture quality is excellent, as well as the audio.  Combined with the cheap price Amazon had it at, I couldn't pass it up.<br /><br />Regarding the series, I have not read the books, and won't until the series is over - I don't want to spoil what I find to be an excellent series so far.  I was sucked into it within the first ten minutes of episode one.  The dark introduction was great and definitely had me curious.  The political and personal drama also has been very dark and interesting.  Some of the shocking things that happen in this series makes me glad this is an HBO series - networks would have been far to tame for this show.  I love sci-fi/fantasy series, and this one has not disappointed me in the fantasy realm.  Cannot wait for season 2!
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is totally cool. I have it for my fire and it is AWESOME .But if your afraid of blades don't get it<br />I love it. it is totally more than 1 star.

B007FH9GT2|4.0|I've been waiting to watch this version of the movie. It wasn't in theaters very long...<br /><br />I've read all of the books in the \\"Millennium\\" trilogy, and I've also seen the Swedish movie(s). I can't say that I liked one version better than the other. Both versions of the movie had their quirks. For example, in the Swedish version, Lisbeth seemed a bit too \\"sociable.\\" The book described her as being socially awkward (to say the least), bordering on autistic. In this version, I liked that the director stuck closely to the book's description of her. If you haven't read the books prior to seeing this movie, you may be somewhat confused. I'd heard reviews from friends who'd seen the movie and they didn't like it; they found the plot difficult to follow. I can see how this can be. The book has so many details and in both movie versions, it seemed as if they were trying to fit as many of the details into the movie as possible. If you haven't read the book, it can be confusing. However, overall, I liked this movie. I will be buying it soon.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|With much regret, I right this review of Fifty Shades Freed.  Regret that this story is over, its strange that I already miss these characters, its almost like I've lost good friends. I LOVED this story, each and everyone of the three novels.  Ana's inner goddess remarks made me laugh, Christians horrid past made me cry and Ana's unconditional love made me sigh.  I know sappy, huh?, but it is true.  There is kinky erotic sex, romance and mystery, all the components for a great love story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVE THIS SERIES! Oh please E.L. James, write us a 4th! I laughed, I cried, I had to pick my jaw up off the floor a few times too! Even if you don't typically read or have never read this type of book like me, IT IS A MUST! You won't want to put it down and you'll read all three in 3 days just like me! =)
B007C9N4H8|2.0|I'm 46. Grew up with the Muppets. I love them. I didn't like this movie and honestly I don't understand what other people like about it. It's not a good movie at all. The only thing it has going for it is nostalgia. As a movie the story is weak, the music numbers with minor exceptions are super flat. I went in expecting awesome from all the hype. I would have been happy if it was just so-so but for me it was just bad. Bad writing, bad story, bad music. Nothing.<br /><br />Maybe I'll watch it again in 10 years and change my opinion. I want to be believe though that rather, all the people that like it now will watch in again in 10 years and wonder what they were thinking.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Like so many people writing reviews for Wool Omnibus 1-5, I read fast and voraciously - usually 3-4 books per week, sometimes more. I got the original first part as a freebie, read it, and was disappointed because that's all there was - felt I was missing a lot of the story. Then I discovered the Omnibus. I bought it last night, and I finished it 24 hours later. I couldn't put it down - was reading every available moment today. The writing is effective enough to make you feel as though you're experiencing it all yourself, whether a tense moment, a breathless (literally) moment, or a touching moment. I was completely pulled into the story and bought into every character, every action, every thought. I felt sadness at the loss of some of the characters. I felt a bubble of happiness inside when things went right. I feel bereft now that it's done - even after 5 parts, I still feel like I'm missing a lot of the story. I want more. I want to know what happens with Jules and her silo once the truth is spread. I want to know what happens to Jimmy and the kids, and all the other silos and their leaders once they find out about Jules. I don't want it to end. I heartily recommend this to any reader who loves good storytelling and a gripping story. Keep writing about these silos, Hugh, and we'll keep reading!

This story completely absorbed me and I didn't want it to end.  I was completely entertained and deeply moved by The Fault In Our Stars.  I will not forget Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters.  Thank you, Mr. Green.

B005M61PGA|5.0|The newest Katie CD harkens back to her earlier stuff.  It's like the long-awaited return of an old friend you thought you had lost.  Although I personally liked her 4th CD \\"House\\", I can see why many Katie fans did not.  To me, \\"House\\" had a carnival feel to it and was a departure from her jazzier material.  Btw, I hate carnivals.  Anyway, producer Mike Batt is back to right the ship.  The optimistic \\"Gold In Them Hills\\" kicks off the CD nicely, and I had a feeling this CD was going to be a nice listen. I was not disappointed.  After the next 2 songs, \\"Better Than a Dream\\", and \\"Bit That I Don't Get\\" I thought this could be my 2nd favorite Kaite CD (it's tough to surpass her debut).  Like the other reviewer said, there are no fillers here.  It' a beautiful collection of songs that wraps up nicely with 2 fine ballads \\"Walls of the World\\" and the title track \\"Secret Symphony\\", which evokes the same intoxicating feel of \\"Lilac wine\\". Ok, so I'll be the first to say it - the CD cover is nicely done too.  Katie doesn't need to look pretty on the album cover to sell CDs, but it sure doesn't hurt.  Incidently, I downloaded \\"House\\" rather than buy the CD because her photo on the CD cover was not something I enjoyed looking at.  Conversely, Secret Symphony = great album cover, great CD!

1451648537|4.0|For anyone currently studying technology or working in the technology field, particularly if you arrived on earth before the personal computer, (as well as for anyone who owns an i-anything)  this book is a great read. In addition to learning about the interesting life of Steve Jobs (regardless of your opinion of the person and the company) this biography allows you to reminisce about everything from the introduction of personal computers to revolutionary products like the i-pod to where we are today with cloud computing. Whenever key decisions were being made or new products were being launched, I found myself thinking about where I was at those moments: typing book reports, using Encyclopedias for research, enjoying tunes on a Sony Walkman, working for a hardware competitor, etc...<br /><br />This book will really help you understand how complex he was - his emotional and physical challenges, his management style, strained friendships and relationships, and his creativeness and obsession with perfection and simplicity of the products he developed - from the time of his adoption right down to his dying days.
B006ZCWU5K|1.0|I like Bruce Springsteen, but this album is just terrible.  The songs are blah...  Wish it was a good album.
1451648537|4.0|Did Jobs wanted his biography to be written only for his kids to know why and to understand what he did? Every episode told in accordance with the product development rightly established reliable image to his great creation, Apple. Here again Jobs succeeded in making Walter Isaacson, his chosen class A talent, not only delivered his final message to employees but also sent elaborated advertisements to Apple users. In every part of this book, we can feel his passion to establish an lasting company where innovative creativity is imbued and new technology always can meet with liberal arts. Unmistakably Jobs was one of the great leaders of our times who could push innovations by both drawing the big pictures and by sticking to the perfection of every details relentlessly. His great strength of focusing resulted in succession of great products with simple good design. His saying \\"customers don't know what they want until we've shown them\\" expresses his great confidence in his proposed devices well.<br />Jobs's comment on Sony is a moment with a flea in our ears for Japanese. Japanese companies seem to become maniac groups completely infatuated with the competition in featuring nice-to-have functions to commodities. They never act together as a whole to produce customer friendly products. Instead they are holding the sectionalism while fearing about cannibalization extremely. We saw creativity occurred when one strong personality succeeded in combining a feel for both the humanities and the sciences. Strong leadership, like Jobs, who controls all of his teams and pushes them to work as one strong company, with one bottom line, is anticipated for the rejuvenation of Japanese companies.<br />What are the ten things Apple is brooding for the next with Tim Cook?

B0009S2T0M|5.0|No spoilers here!  But you know that if Tarantino gave it his stamp of approval, then it's gotta be twisted!<br /><br />I am a fan of Chan Wook Park's films ([[ASIN:B005B0ZF3Q I'm a Cyborg, but That's OK]], [[ASIN:B000BGH2A4 Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance]] and [[ASIN:B000GBEWNY Lady Vengeance]]).  I have yet to see others, but with just these four I am happy as pie!<br /><br />Like his other films, the attention to detail is astonishing.  The camerawork, the angles, the shots, the cuts, the pans, the dialogue... everything is so well placed that we the viewer feel like we are in a 'motion picture novel' of sorts.<br /><br />Starting out we get the sense of a Kafka-esque imprisonment story.  But things quickly become stranger with each passing minute.  Things seem to be more normal once our protagonist leaves his 'prison' but we find that he is merely trapped in a different kind of prison without walls.<br /><br />There is a lot of violence, but it's not overly bloody or gory, which is nice.  It's one of the things I like about Park's films.  We see in one scene, for instance, a hammer poised over a man's tooth (close up), then the tooth starts being pulled and we see some blood trickling out, then the camera changes to the wielder of the hammer and he pulls his arm down and we hear, not see, the resulting tooth-ectomy, then we see a bloody tooth being dropped on a computer keyboard.  But we never see the tooth being ripped out since it cuts away.  Still, I feel that this only heightens the sense of horror and gritty drama.  It keeps the film from being a 'gore-fest' and keeps it rooted in the true sense of Art House film.<br /><br />I thought Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance was a better film, though it was much more straightforward and less complex.  In this film we really have a sense of mystery that we focus on, rather than focusing on the actual motive for revenge and the emotions of the characters solely.  In the end, revenge is the theme, and it follows the grouping of his other films in his 'Revenge Trilogy' if you will.<br /><br />This is an excellent film and I highly recommend it, just keep an open mind and be prepared to be shocked!  A well directed, wonderfully acted, and beautifully told story of horrific proportions.his other films in his 'Revenge Trilogy' if you will.<br /><br />This is an excellent film and I highly recommend it, just keep an open mind and be prepared to be shocked!

B004HO6I4W|5.0|Initially, I purchased this movie from Wal-Mart but it only included the DVD. It instantly became my sons favorite movie. He loves all of the uptempo music. However, he watched it until it started skipping. So, I went in search of a reasonably priced version with digital copy. Amazon fit the bill.

B001IMFHTS|3.0|To laymen's ears without much knowledge of the music, just simply enjoying the classical, this performance sounds like rap song or rap noise compare to old version of Berlin's recording.

B0059XTTW8|3.0|It's impossible for me to judge the movie without reference to the book (an all-time favorite) and the miniseries (well liked, with minor reservations). On the whole, the movie is just okay, though it does have some strengths.<br /><br />The movie is about 40 percent the length of the miniseries, so it's very distilled. No wonder people found it hard to follow. The movie is far more focused on Smiley than either the book or the miniseries, so you learn little about the suspects, and it isn't obvious, though it should be, who the mole is. The book is often categorized as a mystery, but it's not; everyone knows who the mole is from the start; they just don't want to believe it, and much of the character evolution is their coming to terms with what they've known all along. This doesn't work as well in the miniseries because we're less exposed to character thoughts and feelings. It doesn't work at all in the movie because the suspects are all just passers by.<br /><br />On the other hand, the movie had a bigger budget and access to locations (Budapest, most notably) that would have been impossible for the miniseries, which was made when there was still an Iron Curtain. They even used a Russian actress to play the Russian woman who's the catalyst for the final unraveling of the mole's identity. Generally, the film is technically excellent (art/set direction, costume design, photography, etc.). The sets for the scenes at the Circus are outstanding--a grim, industrial place. Though the set for the head's conference room is a bit over the top.<br /><br />Gary Oldman's performance is a major strength of the movie; it's an interpretation of the character more consistent than Alec Guinness is with the way Le Carré writes Smiley (more remorseless, less avuncular); each performance is excellent in its own way.<br /><br />For reasons unclear to me (even though I listened to the commentary track), they recast a character who's something of a skirt chaser as a closet gay--not an objectionable change but rather pointless.<br /><br />Other casting is less glamorous than the miniseries, with the exception of Colin Firth, who very much looks his age; the parts are practically cameos, though. John Hurt is outstanding as the desperate, dying Control.<br /><br />The movie has more of a historical/period feel to it than the book and miniseries, which were written/produced much nearer to the time when the story takes place when the Soviet Union was still the chief bad guy for Anglo-American spy/thriller fiction. The disillusionment is therefore more remote, less raw.<br /><br />The DVD includes a commentary track with the director, Tomas Alfredson, and Gary Oldman. It's a middle of the road commentary--not bad, but not especially entertaining. Actor commentaries are usually awful (Peter O'Toole excepted), but Oldman doesn't do too much of the \\"so and so [a fellow actor] really nailed that scene\\" kind of comment, so most of his contribution is informative.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|It is a real good movie . The song that Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson sang was realy good . To me its a must have . And I like John Wayne I like about all his movies .
B006PHD0RW|5.0|The game graphics are well done and cute. Gameplay increases in challenge. So far it isn't easy, but it is not too hard. There are a lot of levels. The basic premise is to fit the puzzle pieces (groceries) together efficiently in the bag. There are different item types and time trials. There are also fun levels to smash groceries.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I couldn't stop reading! I agree with another review that said most second books in a trilogy tend to be just \\"fillers\\" and while I also was not surprised with some of the revealed secrets, I too welcomed them.

B006OAB6EY|5.0|This album by Queen is amazing. It will literally change your life, because it is so \\"liberating.\\" When I mean by that is, is that one time I heard that Freddie say his albums/songs are supposed to be like a good movie that helps you forget all that troubles you, this is exactly what this album accomplishes in amazing pure simple \\"Rock\\" form!<br /><br />The quality is literally amazing, everything about this CD is an example of all of the Queen 2011 Remasters; they sound amazing, have great bonus songs/EPs with them, and do justice to The \\"Queen\\" legacy in music.
B002S0OBN2|4.0|Let me start by saying that I like this musical. I hate the ending, the story is too altered from where we begin in Phantom, but I like this musical. Some of the songs remain in my head long after I've stopped listening, and I honestly feel that if ALW had flushed out the story a bit more BEFORE opening, the show would have done drastically better. That, and he should never have signed off on the ending, which I'm not going to spoil for you if you haven't already been spoiled.<br /><br />I'm not going to review this track by track, but I'll go over a few likes and dislikes. Since I'm a positive person, I'll start with the likes:<br />1.)The Leads - Thank you, ALW, for casting Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess. They are so good together. I thank you, my ears thank you, etc., etc.<br />2.)The Songs (for the most part) - My favorites include: Till I Hear You Sing, Look with Your Heart, Beneath a Moonless Sky, Once Upon Another Time, Beautiful, The Beauty Underneath, Why Does She Love Me?, Devil Take the Hindmost, and Love Never Dies.<br />3.)The Extra DVD: I enjoyed hearing their opinions of the musical, seeing the recording process, and imagining that things would turn out so much better than they did. OK, that last part makes me sad, actually.<br />Dislikes:<br />1.) The End - Honestly, I have no major gripes with the rest of the story, but the end, oy vey!<br />2.) Meg and Mdm. Giry - No offense to the actresses, but they both irritated me. Mdm. Giry had too thick of a fake French accent, and Meg, every time it transfers from TIHYS to Giry Confronts the Phantom with Meg singing \\"Tell me did you watch,\\" my reaction is *cringe*, then I channel Peter Griffin, \\"Shut up, Meg\\" and change the song. Just not pleasant. My poor ears. I also hate \\"Bathing Beauty.\\"<br /><br />This is not really a dislike, so I won't put it there, but I get a bit disturbed by Gustave's \\"yes\\"'s during the Beauty Underneath. As I've said, I like that song, but Phantom singing, \\"You can take it\\" and Gustave excitedly answering, \\"Yes!\\" is just too much. It's just full of so much wrong. How did they NOT catch that?<br /><br />I fear that based on the faults of the production (unless the Australian-based film of the production goes over well here in the States) Love Never Dies will never come to Broadway, which is sad, really. Even with its faults, I would have gone to see it.

1451627289|3.0|I am strugling through this book.. It is interesting but Stephen King is too wordy..I think the Auto Book verision would be easier and more enjoyable....
B000UBMSB8|4.0|Fans of Philip K. Dick are often very critical of Blade Runner. I can understand why: the movie greatly simplifies Dick's [[ASIN:0345404475 story]]. It removes the entire subplot with radiation victim J.R. Isidore, as well as all of Dick's peculiar cultural details, such as the near-worship of animals, the Mercerist religion, and the sinister TV host. It even removes Rick Deckard's wife. Of course the story is poorer without these sources of characterization.<br /><br />But in my opinion, that's not necessarily bad, and might even have been necessary for any successful film adaptation. At its core, Dick's novel greatly resembled classic American [[ASIN:1883011078 crime fiction]]. Rick Deckard is a lot like [[ASIN:0394757688 Philip Marlowe]], with a strong moral core and sense of obligation that rises to the surface at key moments in the story, like the conflict with Phil Resch or the final showdown with Roy Baty. Deckard's profound disgust for Baty in that last scene (\\"Androids do that,\\" he says upon learning that the androids have senselessly killed a spider) is a perfect match for Marlowe's contempt of [[ASIN:0394758285 Lash Canino]] and other thugs. The best way to portray Deckard in a film would probably be to play him exactly like Marlowe, impassive and cold, wrapped up in a hat and trench coat, but with some occasional suggestion of sorrow.<br /><br />That, at least, is something that Ridley Scott can understand. He removes all of Deckard's background and characterization, but Harrison Ford can play a calm tough guy who also looks like he might be thinking something, and that's really all that's needed. The rest is atmosphere. Dick's book described a desolate post-nuclear Earth where vast tracts of land, and large parts of major cities, lay completely abandoned. Scott throws that out as well. Instead, the film looks more like [[ASIN:0441012035 Neuromancer]]: garish neon advertisements, crowded streets and ragged ne'er-do-wells. But if you keep in mind the Chandler analogy, the tone is still appropriate for Dick's story. The important thing is that the bounty hunter (or detective) is himself lonely and reserved.<br /><br />There is a much bigger discrepancy between the book and the film, though, having to do with the portrayal of the androids. The film chooses to make the androids sympathetic. In some sense its biggest payoff is Rutger Hauer's famous mournful monologue, which does not appear in the book, and was in fact completely improvised on the set. It is suggested that the androids are, in fact, superior to humans, and capable of noble suffering. Their anger against humans is high tragedy, and the humans hunt them out of fear of the unknown. Even Vangelis' brilliant [[ASIN:B000002IZM theme music]] underscores the tragic romanticism of Hauer's image. Audiences have long debated whether Deckard himself might be an android; in this film, that would be a way of elevating him and giving him additional moral superiority.<br /><br />But Dick's book is brutal. It unequivocally holds, with no room for ambiguity, that the androids are savage, irredeemable psychopaths. This is true not only of Roy Baty, who is supposed to be the most violent one, but also of his android wife Irmgard (absent from the film), who can imitate politeness and refinement, but who nonetheless takes an active role in dissecting the spider (a huge moral offense in the book's world). This judgment is final; androids are forever doomed to be incapable of empathy even for each other, to say nothing of any other form of life. They are united only by fear and anger. Dick treats this fact as horrifying and disturbing, but he never questions it. Of course Deckard is not an android in the book.<br /><br />Which view would be better for a film version? I prefer Dick's unsentimental, unforgiving approach. But I suspect it may be unbearably oppressive in a film. It works in a more cerebral and philosophical way, as a moral meditation, whereas Hauer's tragic outlawhas more in common with glamorous Hollywood stylization. But the latter is also an integral part of film noir, which needs charismatic antagonists, worthy of testing the protagonist's limits. The logic of Blade Runner pretty much forces the androids to be the emotional lynchpins. And, after all, even in the book, one would think that humans ought to be morally culpable for creating the androids.<br /><br />Ultimately both approaches are compelling. The book and the film comfortably exist side by side, exploring completely different angles of the story. In a way, Scott's choices allow the film to be experienced on its own merits: the dark cinematography and paranoid tone, the theme music, the dying monologue. The flip side of Dick's story, it would seem, can leave one just as shaken.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|this is one of my fag games but.  . . after 21 elements oh look a that, must foreclose! this game is great but I'm very dissapointed with it's ability to stay active. :(
0451457994|4.0|This book can be stunning at times, what I digged the most was the travel through the void space. The description of this is so vivid, and really takes you there, that I must think that Arthur C. Clarke went there for himself! So how is this possible? Hm.. Well, the definition of what a human is or can be is actually an open definition. So I think that Arthur was carrying a universe around inside of him. Personally it's my experience that there actually exists super-human powers, Arthur actually also touches upon this in the book, where he describes the ultimate Extra Terristials, not as some human-like creatures, but as forces which works on the universe. Clarke is not only a science geek, but he is equally immersed in religion and art.
B0029U26X8|4.0|I enjoyed reading this marvelous English translation of the classic very much. I must admit, however, that sometimes his attitude (or words, rather) are too stoic that I had to stop reading and close the book. Highly admirable, yes, but didn't he go too far? I don't know about how other people think, and it may not be right to 'attack' this book, especially this one, but in my case there were some moments during turning over the pages that I found him 'pathetic.'(Please pardon the expression.) No wonder that he \\"committed suicide\\" before he reaches the early age of 59.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|interesting, easy to play, good story, hidden image game, some clues hard to find, banter among characters funny would recommend
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|I have NOT read the books, but after seeing one particular scene of this movie, remember a customer at my work saying that it is \\"gritty\\" and \\"disturbing.\\"  True on both accounts.  This was a VERY GOOD movie and I didn't think I could make it through after seeing that horrible rape scene, but the story was too interesting for me to tare myself away.  It is rated \\"R\\" for MANY reasons, so make sure that you're at least 17 before you see it.  Definintely not a childrens movie.  In case anyone out there like me hasn't read the books and is wondering on how this movie would be for youngsters.<br />I admit I was expecting to have nightmares after I saw it, and to my shock I did not.  Though that doesn't mean I still could in the future.<br /><br />I thought that Rooney Mara did a FANTASTIC JOB as Lisabeth Salander, though I won't pretend I fully understood her character.  Let's just say you probably have to read the books to learn more about her and  her past, though I'm afraid to read them.  If it's anything like that rape scene, I don't know how much I could take.  I barely made it through.  I hope that the Anerican's do make the other two so I can see more of the story, but like I said, after that rape scene I was on edge for the entire rest of the movie.<br /><br />Don't let my fear of the rape scene draw you away from this movie though.  I'm one of those people not equipped to deal with such cruelty, and as I said I couldn't tare myself away from this movie.  It was EXCELLENT in my opinion, and one that everyone should at least see.  It's gripping and holds your attention throughout. I wouldn't have watched it if it wasn't.  This movie will stay with you LONG after it is over.  This I promise you.<br /><br />****UPDATE 3/25/12****<br /><br />I saw the Swedish version of the film last night, and I've gotta say that though that version has more storyline than the American one does, our version has the better acting/directing/scenery/cinematography/soundtrack....etcetera, etcetera.  There is just no comparison between Noomi Rapace, and Rooney Mara.  The same goes with the chemistry between Mikael Blomkvist and Lisabeth Salander in the versions either.  You cannot even compete with Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig!!  Overall, your best bet is to see the American version of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\"  I will update yet again after having read the book and seeing BOTH versions of the film once more.  I guarantee it.a, etcetera.  There is just no comparison between Noomi Rapace, and Rooney Mara.

B006X96PF6|5.0|I love everything Loreena McKennitt does and \\"Troubadours on the Rhine\\" is another exceptional recording. Unlike her previous live CD's, this one is more intimate in that she is accompanied only by Brian Hughes and Caroline Lavelle, two of her regular touring members. Nonetheless, her songs on this CD retain that complex and ethereal quality that is distinctly Loreena. Her vocals as always are equisitely beautiful, but I was especially impressed by the musical reproduction of her songs by this trio. I've always loved Loreena singing \\"The Bonny Swans\\", but \\"Penelope's Song\\" has become a more recent favorite of mine. The epic \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" is also inluded. This is a grand performance from the woman who is the absolute best ever!!

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I read the book several years ago and I currently think that it is one of the best of the fantasy genre. This HBO television adaptation of the George RR Martin's story is right on with nearly every detail. And although I already knew how things were going to play out by the end of this season one (book one) story arc, I still found the action to be riveting, suspenseful and dramatic. I am downright amazed at how good this TV show turned out to be.<br /><br />The Story - As a single novel, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is one of the most interesting, innovative and surprising stories of its kind. Martin has created his very own unique overlay to the traditional fantasy yarn, one that clouds the distinctions between good and evil and one that is based on well thought out character types and world building. The set up for the larger story (in the books that follow) is outstanding. The TV show is completely true to the story.<br /><br />The Characters - Martin's characters (and there are lots of them) have some real depth and dimension, but the TV show really takes these characters even further into the visual dimension. I think it added to what I already thought I knew about these characters. And while every single actor is perfect in their role, I was especially impressed by Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannaster, Maisie Williams as Arya Stark and Kit Harington as Jon Snow. These three are definitely some of the most interesting characters from the books and their portrayals were dead on.<br /><br />The Setting - The overall look to this TV show is wonderful! The settings are true to their geographic placement in Martin's world, but they are also so accurately and interestingly detailed. In the special features, it was stated that each place was to have its own unique look, so that you knew immediately that you were in Winterfell, The Wall or Kings Landing.<br /><br />Overall, five stars for this perfect TV show adaptation. I'm anxiously awaiting the next couple of seasons because they should be just as good as this first season.they should be just as good as this first season.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|if you haven't downloaded this game yet you should. plenty to choose from you won't get board here. I like it for the challenging games.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a handy and practical app that I have used for several years on my Motorola DROID. I keep several Notes pinned to my status bar named Groceries, Drugstore, etc. I can then add things as needed without having to keep up with a piece of paper. There is also the benefit of setting reminders for a specific date and time. This is convenient to create a list of questions or thoughts, for an upcoming appointment or meeting. The list will open just in time!<br /><br />I just downloaded it to my Kindle. I'm still figuring out all the bells and whistles available with a Kindle, but I'm sure it will be just as useful!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this app!!  It is very addicting and very fun!! It is a free app, you just have to have enough sense to pay attention to what you are clicking.  I do see that it is very easy to purchase something you don't want but just read before you click!!!  Also I would NOT recommend this for young children!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun fun. I enjoy all da free games. oh yea. easy fun games.enjoy people these games are for all ages.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a good book. I like how easy it is to pick up and how you would like to keep reading it when its time to put it down. I really enjoyed how the characters had somewhat distinct personalities, although there are a lot of characters who you never really get to know. That was probably what I liked best: the characters. And although you don't get to the main focus of the story it doesn't drag at all. Overall it was great. Not a big fan of the ending personally but that's just me... I don't think the author ended it poorly. I may get the next one sometime but im not in a rush. I would recommend this book though. Even if you don't want to get in to a series. It really is a good book. Not perfect, but definitely at least good.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|Overall this is a nice game and fun but it is too short and easy for a paid app.  Beat  the game in an hour.  My 8 year old was even giving me suggestions on how to beat some of the higher levels.
