0143038419|5.0|I found this book to be a remarkable travelogue where the exploration is as much exterior trekking of three different countries along with each country representing the inner movement and outer expression of spirit/soul.     After a bitter divorce, the author is plagued by despair and decides to journey to three countries over the course of a year. Each country represents an aspect of the author seeking expression.     In Italy, we find the expression of \\"the good life\\" with delightful foods, full-bodied wines and engaging conversation partners. I find this as the soul delighting in everyday pleasures to the fullest.     Then in India, the shift is to the austerity and transcendence of spirit as Gilbert journeys to an ashram.     The balance of spirit-soul is found in Bali with study under a medicine man and an exciting love affair.    This is a wonderful book that is rewarding on both worldly and spiritual levels. Another book that can be enjoyed for its spiritual message of personal transformation is \\"Nexus: A Neo Novel\\" by Deborah Morrison and Arvind Singh.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I know that some comparisons have been made between North & South and Pride & Prejudice, but I'd have to say that Richard Armitage's portrayal of Mr. Thornton leaves all Mr. Darcys in the dust. And there is so much more to this story than the romance (although the romance is what will have me watching it again and again.)     I read the book subsequent to seeing the DVD, and I am of the opinion that the film really did justice to the novel. And after reading it, I concluded that the casting in the film was perfect; I simply can't imagine anyone else filling the roles of Thornton and Margaret quite so well.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|An excerpt from Newton Minnow's Vast Wasteland Speech to the National Association of Broadcasters on May 9, 1961:<br /><br />\\"When television is good, nothing--not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers--nothing is better.<br /><br />But when television is bad, nothing is worse. I invite you to sit down in front of your television set when your station goes on the air and stay there without a book, magazine, newspaper, profit and-loss sheet or rating book to distract you--and keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off. I can assure you that you will observe a vast wasteland.<br /><br />You will see a procession of game shows, violence, audience-participation shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, western badmen, western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence and cartoons. And, endlessly, commercials--many screaming, cajoling and offending. And most of all, boredom. True, you will see a few things you will enjoy. But they will be very, very few. And if you think I exaggerate, try it. ....<br /><br />Why is so much of television so bad? I have heard many answers: demands of your advertisers; competition for ever-higher ratings; the need always to attract a mass audience; the high cost of television programs; the insatiable appetite for programming material--these are some of them. Unquestionably these are tough problems not susceptible to easy answers.<br /><br />But I am not convinced that you have tried hard enough to solve them . . . and I am not convinced that the people's taste is as low as some of you assume.\\"<br /><br />My taste is certainly not that low. Goodbye CW, let the WB Rest In Peace. May the CW's grave be a million miles away from yours!<br />Veronica Mars was good television - anything on the CW (Besides Supernatural) is not. What a waste of what was a good network in the WB era

Very easy to follow and it will make you think a little bit extra, when you go back out for a photo shoot. This book is chuck full of tips and tricks of the trade and even though a lot of it is common knowlege that every semi-serious photographer should know, there are some nice gems of information in there that you may not have thought of! What a fun, entertaining, yet very educational book!    Kudos to Scott Kelby!    My vote: Buy it - you will love it! It's a must have!

B000OCXMAE|5.0|Minutes to Midnight was probably the greatest change (in terms of direction) I've seen in a band since Judas Priest released \\"Turbo\\" after the amazing fast and heavy \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" back in the 80's. Not to say that I'm comparing them to Judas Priest, because they are both two COMPLETELY different bands.     At first I didn't like it as much, but after I let it sink in for a few listens, it shows a lot of promise to the new Linkin Park. Songs like \\"Shadow of The Day,\\" \\"Leave Out All The Rest,\\" and \\"Valentines Day\\" are definitely NOT for those that are looking for a new \\"One Step Closer\\" or \\"Somewhere I Belong,\\" but they're great ballads that show variety to Linkin Park's sound. They do give us a few heavy metal treats like \\"Given Up\\", \\"Bleed It Out\\", and \\"No More Sorrow,\\" which are all great classic Linkin Park songs. \\"In Pieces\\", and \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" shows great skill in the band (the solo on \\"In Pieces\\" was definitely a surprise). \\"Hands Held High\\" is way over hyped by critics; but it's a decent rap song, just not really my taste. The mellow \\"In Between\\" is your average ballad that doesn't really have anything new to bring to the table, but the single \\"What I've Done\\" demonstrates perfectly what the album's about.     The only reason why they've been criticized negatively by fans is because they compared this to their previous efforts. By making comparisons, they only focus on the past albums strengths and the new album's weaknesses, which is no way to view an album. This is probably why Meteora got so much praise, since it sounds like a continuation of Hybrid Theory (which is way better). What most people who are against this album need to realize is this: Rap metal is dead, just ask Limp Bizkit.     Unlike with Judas Priest's \\"Turbo\\", this band created an album that was true to them. People who believe the band sold out with this album, you need to hear \\"Reanimation\\" and \\"Collision Course\\" and convince me why THAT isn't selling out. Ifyou have an open mind and aren't clouded by their last 2 studio albums, this is an album for you. Linkin Park knew that they were going to lose fans over this album and they went with it anyway. I have a newfound respect for Linkin Park, because even though they were going to get blasted by fans, they stuck to what they were passionate about and aren't out to please them, (unlike most mainstream artists). This album is a guilty pleasure. It is softer than their previous efforts, but it's still great rock/metal music.

0671799320|5.0|We are living in the Age of oil.    World and human civilization have experienced different \\"ages\\" such as the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Gilded Age, and so on.  The 20th and 21st Centuries are indeed, the \\"Oil Age.\\"  We are living in it.  This book is one of the most informative and relevant books published in recent years, In my opinion.  This work by Daniel Yergin was and still is prescient today, in 2007. \\"The Prize\\" tells the story of where we are today, and how we got here.  It also latently foresees where we're going in the future.  The book doesn't tell us - we just know.  We're human.  This book is so comprehensive and has so much information only a small portion of it can be noted.  Below relates to WWII, and former Iranian leader Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh.       \\"The Prize\\" proceeds chronologically.  And within the chapters there are numerous mini-subtitles for sub-chapters that connect the big picture.  The bibliography and index are excellent and can be used to tie in different figures and historical occurrences.   The 'history of oil' is actually the history of the world: humankind, business, innovations, globalization, war, and geo-political power-plays.  The very survival of a nation-state is based upon oil.     \\"The Prize\\" begins with tiny puddles of black, sticky, goo, in Pennsylvania in the mid 1800s.  Locals collected this goo and realized its many uses.  In 1859 oil was struck.  Almost immediately, the wealth and power amassed from possession and control of oil was realized.  The initial trust acts in the U.S. are related to the oil industry, in which Barons quickly gained gargantuan amounts of wealth and political power.    Enter WWII:    The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor because of oil.  Japanese  conquests throughout South-East Asia and the Pacific were motivated not only by the quest for dominance but for securing oil and keeping their oil (fuel) supply lines open.  Without supply lines of oil, the war machine would completely break down, as itlater did (Chapter 8).      The Americans sacrificed a lot, but Japan in large part lost WWII because of its lack of fuel for planes, ships, and ground forces.  Domestically, the Japanese economy collapsed because of its inability to import oil.  The Kamikazes were brought into existence after the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Philippines, in 1944. Lack of oil meant lack of fighter plane fuel.  Fuel supplies became so low they actually stopped training Japanese pilots at all.  Pilots were ordered to \\"follow the leader\\" to the attack site because they didn't even have navigation training.    There was even an \\"Oil Czar\\" In the U.S. during World War II in PAW, the Petroleum Administration for War.  The Oil Czar was Harold Ickes.      In the European Theater's Eastern Front Germany invaded Russia with Operation Barbarossa mostly to get the oil in the Caucuses (In addition to \\"lebensraum\\" and \\"untermensch\\" beliefs). In addition, a needed land-route to Iron Ore in Scandinavia via the Baltic SSR Republics was a factor.  Hitler also began making synthetic oil because without enough of it Germany's war machine, domestic economy, and arms production were doomed.  These synthetic oil factories were top targets in Allied bombing missions.      Oil and the Cold War World:    The Soviets dominated Eastern Europe and exerted its influence after WWII for 45 years because the Allies ran out of gasoline.  When the British 3rd Army and U.S. 1st Army were advancing eastward toward Berlin chasing demoralized, retreating, and broken German troops in disarray.  But because of the lack of gasoline for the Allied Armies, a million people ended up losing their lives and war was prolonged because the Germans were able to retreat and re-organize (page 388).    If someone says \\"it's not about the oil\\" today in 2007, tell them to read this book.  Oil encompasses almost all things in our daily lives, whether we are are conscious of it, or not.       Oil, Military, and Economic Interests:     Democratically elected governments are overthrown by foreign governments because of oil.  In 1953 Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh was democratically elected in Iran.  He was an anti-communist.  He didn't like the 93% to 7% profit sharing split with a British Oil company operating inside Iran.  He changed it to 50-50.  The CIA sponsored a coup to overthrow him.  Americans were repeatedly told by the U.S. media that Mossadegh was a communist and communist sympathizer, although factually untrue.  The American public believed this propaganda, according to poll results.  Gullible?  Mossadegh was ousted and the Shah was placed in power.  Democracy has never been supported in the Middle East and it isn't now by the U.S. government.  Also see the Carter Doctrine of 1980.    Most of us as individual consumers literally need oil to function.  Dependence upon oil is for the continuation of the nation-state, its    military machines, and domestic economy.  More critical today, is that nation-states need a *sufficient* supply of it.      This is a positive book.  It's a history book.    We're in the heart of the \\"Oil Age.\\"
B00003CXA2|5.0|The sweetest of love stories, philosophically profound, deep as the ocean and light as a feather... and very funny. Forrest Gump is the ultimate movie in so many ways, there are so many sides to it. It's predominantly a `serious' film about a dim headed, yet good hearted southern boy and how the absence of a dysfunctional ego and a simple sense of honor and integrity enables him to flow through life effortlessly, like the metaphor of the white feather we see at the beginning and the end of the film.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a masterfully written and directed tale that punctuates deep philosophical substance with a good deal of humor -the scene of Forrest and Bubba scrubbing the floor with toothbrushes while Bubba enlightens Forrest on the details of `shrimping' is just too funny for words. There's never been a film like it before or since. It ingeniously weaves the history of a generation into the script, taking scenes from the Vietnam war, JFK, the 60's protest movement and flower power, and onward into the age of AIDS.  Actual film clippings from various historical events are cleverly edited to enable Forrest to step into them and interact. Wonderful Stuff... it's kind of a nod to the `Wonder Years'.<br /><br />As richly entertaining as Forrest's life is, and as very funny as many of the scenes are, it's still the character of Forrest that carries the move. He's impossible not to like. You become significantly invested in his life. You share his heartbreak as Jenny repeated shuns the open heart he offers her. And you admire his quiet acceptance of 'what is'. His lack of self consciousness - devoid of the myriad games and manipulations that most people of `greater intelligence' display -his simple open heartedness and sense of personal integrity which he carries through life are inspirational. This clearly is a story that shows the ultimate triumph of virtue over the complex dysfunctions of the mind. Jenny plays out a sad character... always looking somewhere else for love, although she finds it on her death bed And Lt. Dan is just an awesome character. His 360 degree turn through what life deals him is as inspirational as Forrest's.<br /><br />The closing scene is the most memorable for me... the feather floats in the random breeze, as Forrest muses about predestination vs random existence: \\" I think it's both... both happening at the same time.\\" - which leads me to believe our beloved Forrest isn't as dumb as he's portrayed.though she finds it on her death bed And Lt. Dan is just an awesome character. His 360 degree turn through what life deals him is as inspirational as Forrest's.

B00003CXUM|3.0|I was more engrossed in this film than I should have been. It has a very simple plot. No twists and turns. Just the one question: \\"Will they or won't they?\\"<br /><br />Basically, it's the prolonged musings of a man and woman thrown together because their spouses are having an affair. They, however, seem too principled to give into their own obvious chemistry.<br /><br />Like the other Wong Kar Wai films I have seen, this is beautifully directed and photographed. It is set in Hong Kong of the 1960s, therefore, vaguely familiar to us Westerners who remember the 1960s.<br /><br />To be honest, if I watch it again, it will be to revel in Maggie Cheung in the form-fitting cheongsom dresses popular in Hong Kong the 60s. (She's also very pretty in the special features contained on the DVD.)
B000J10EQU|3.0|I was not all that excited about this movie after I watched it.  It seemed long and predicatable.

Where Do the Children Play is my favorite Cat song  Wild World is probably his most listenable song  Miles From Nowhere, Longer Boats, and On The Road to Findout are some of his best as well  I think this is one of the coolest albums to be a fan of, everyone should give it a chance

1594489505|5.0|After reading The Kite Runner, I didn't think Hosseini's second work could compare. I was so wrong! This book is just as good as his first, though in different ways. The Kite Runner tells the story of a boy who made bad choices and later as a man trying to right his wrongs. A Thousand Splendid Suns takes on the story of two women, Mariam and Laila who both are victims. Both are rich in Afghan history and culture. At times, both are very difficult to read. I feel that I have a much better understanding of Afghanistan and its culture after reading Hosseini's works. This book is tragic, yet there is hope. I highly recommend this book, especially if you liked The Kite Runner.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Kelly Clarkson is one of the best voices out there in the music industry right now. She is a very hot commodity. On her most recent release: `My December' she somewhat abandons her signature pop/rock sound and instead takes on more of just a plain old rock sound. Being the big Kelly fan that I am, I bought this CD the day that it came out but, I had to listen to it a week before writing a fair review. I am glad that I did because in the first few times that I listened to it I did not care much for it. I just was not feeling it at all. It seemed she had found the PERFECT formula on `Breakaway' with the melody driven, radio friendly, pop/rock songs  just to \\"throw it all away\\" for an edgier and way more dark sound found here on `My December'.<br /><br />I have to commend Kelly has an artist because it sometimes takes an artist well into their career to be daring enough to take a risk like the one she has taken here. In my opinion the finished product speaks for itself. It is great. The songs are a lot more guitar heavy, more live bass, some of the songs have more of an almost punk sound to them (which she pulls off well) all well keeping in perfect synch with her voice. She writes and sings about heavier topics: feeling alone, empty, lonely and her animosity toward an ex. The lyrics are edgy and raw - a lot more personal. All the songs give us more of an insight into Kelly Clarkson. It's almost as if you're listening to a recent autobiography.<br /><br />Standouts tracks to take note of:<br /><br />\\"Never Again\\" - her first single and probably the most radio friendly song on the set<br /><br />\\"One Minute\\" - A rockin' track that will have you singing along in no time.<br /><br />\\"Sober\\" - Her second single. One of my favorite songs on here. A slower song with a lot of meaning - listen or read along with the words. Great lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Judas\\" - Love her voice on this song!<br /><br />\\"Haunted\\" - My favorite song on this CD. Slower verses while the chorus is louder and very guitar heavy. Great song!!<br /><br />I could only go 4 stars on this release because there are a few songs that I just skip over when they pop up: \\"Be Still\\" and \\"Irvine\\".<br /><br />Kelly knew what she was doing in making this bold move and it shows when listening to these songs. Although it is a bit of a departure it is a welcomed one.4 stars on this release because there are a few songs that I just skip over when they pop up: \\"Be Still\\" and \\"Irvine\\".

1932100660|5.0|Yes I bought the book because some friends of mine suggested that I get this book and read it. Make my own decision based on the information and the references in the book. I took the advice in the book and totally revamped my diet, to see what would happen. Got my blood work done in the lab prior to starting this new advanced lifestyle way of eating a plant based diet. I now know the information that I was given in this book is true for me. My lab results after being on the program now for a little over a month has amazed my doctor and me, again verify the information I read was true. That just a new way of thinking about my diet and eliminating certain things could put me on a better path to good health.     The question for me was, would this information in The China Study give me the health that I want for the rest of my life. I didn't care what other people thought about the book, it was my decision to make and only mine. If the information in this book could help you to have a longer and healthier life, would the cost of this book be worth it? You take control of your health and make the decision and don't allow others to influence your health based upon their believes or theories. My friends by recommending this book for me to read has changed my life.     I highly recommend this book for all to read. What a wonderful way to better health and a great new advanced lifestyle.     Do you have a friend that you could help?
B00005JPLW|5.0|I thought this movie aesthetically amazing. Being a classicist, you have to try to overlook the historical inaccuracies in films like this (I was ranting and raving upon leaving the theater after seeing Troy). At first I was skeptical when the commercials starting airing on TV, but the more they aired the more the film intrigued me. The plot and dialogue was enough to hold my interest, but I'm a sucker for action sequences. Again, I thought this movie was great. To me, it combined the aesthetics of Passion of the Christ with Gladiator and even a smattering of the Lord of the Rings.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I have never bought a movie soundtrack after seeing the movie, but this time I bought three! I had never heard of this singer/songwriter, but I think his group has been around for a while-- sorry, can't think of the name!  Anyway, love this CD! I'm giving one as a gift; relative got the third and played it constantly.  ONCE is a winner!
B000P0J024|5.0|First, the problems:<br /><br />Several of the videos have been altered.  While I can understand why Milli Vanilli were removed from the original version of the \\"Wilbury Twist\\" video (although, if anything, their presence in such an anti-music video music video would only carry added weight), the version of \\"Inside Out,\\" which is missing George Harrison's great rock star theatrics, makes no sense.<br /><br />Second, Jeff Lynne's production sounds just as sugary as it did back in 1988/1990 (but not as over-produced as Tom Petty's ice cream headache-inducing \\"Full Moon Fever\\").  I wish there were acoustic-based \\"alternate\\" versions of these songs sitting around somewhere just waiting to be released, because they'd inevitably sound cleaner, crisper, and, well...better.<br /><br />Lastly and leastly, none of the extra tracks are any where near as good as the albums (well, the \\"Runaway\\" cover is decent).  Without these, both albums could have been put on a single disc, making the set a bit more affordable.<br /><br />Nonetheless:<br /><br />I LOVE these albums.  Songs like \\"Heading for the Light,\\" \\"Congratulations,\\" \\"End of the Line,\\" \\"Inside Out,\\" \\"You Took My Breath Away,\\" and \\"Wilbury Twist\\" are classics, perfect pop craftsmanship.  They feature some of George Harrison's and Bob Dylan's warmest performances, and (of course) the ghost of Roy Orbison haunts the set - rarely do music legends go out in such a beautifully understated way.<br /><br />Is it just me, or is the second album actually better than the first?
B00005JPFC|5.0|Ratatouille is an absolutely wonderful treat, both in animation and in its storyline. Talk about a delicious way to spend hours! Not everyone can do animation, but as this latest movie proves. Pixar can do it well every time.  The flair is French, the story is about a rat, but don't let it fool you - this is the perfect movie for everyone, for all time.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|I have tried to place HIGHWAY 61 and BLONDE ON BLONDE ahead of this one (just as all those entrenched and over-hyped rock critics uniformly do), but can't.  This remains his best (along with BLOOD ON THE TRACKS).  \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" is like an eternal morning.

B000JU7NCE|5.0|I've been a Cure fan since 1987. The Cure is best interpreted live. This concert sees the return of Porl Thompson, one of the architects of the Cure sound from 85's Head On The Door to 92's Wish. With guitar driven soundscapes this  concert delivers a fresh new live experience. Performing 30 songs over 9 different venues, Festival 2005 has a song for every Cure fan. Good flow of songs and excellent production make this one of the best Cure concerts available on DVD.
0743455967|4.0|If Stephen king was to apply his own rules on writing, then half of this book would not be printed. It would have been cut in the review process. Good job it wasn't.    King maybe talking `On writing' but this book is as much a biography and great fun for it. It is written like a novel and so much the bettered for it but a good index would be useful.     On Writing was written either side of a horrific injury to King. It should be read in that light. Kings writing is clear, crisp and moves. However the story meanders. Not being a horror fan, I don't know if this is unusual for King.    Section 1, Kings calls CV. It's more than that. Here King reveals what made him a writer. His childhood experiences are common many fiction writers. Fiction writers are people who dream whole worlds in their heads: Friends and foes, lovers and demons.  People who needed to do that in their childhoods. Kings family moved from pillar to post, denying King the opportunity to make life long childhood friends. King had a brother, but one too much older to be a friend.  People who had lonely periods in their childhoods, dreamy up substitutes. Many became great writers, like King.    Why a horror writer?  If you had baby sitters who stuffed you full of sickly food then locked you in a dark wardrobe to vomit all over your mothers favorite shoes, falling asleep in fear, or a brother who used you as the test pilot for every crazy dangerous scheme he had, what would you write about? King's account of his childhood is hilarious. If he didn't write horror he would make a good humorist.    King went on to learn his craft in short story telling. An excellent apprenticeship. And he made money from despite critic's condemnation. That taught him who really counts in writing. He also taught. The best way to learn anything is to teach it.    Finally King shows that the key to success is believing in yourself or having someone close who does. For King it was his wife, who rescued his career from the bin into which he chucked it in desperation. A wife who has kept her belief ever since and is his first reader.     Section 2, King calls `On writing'. Lots of useful advice here. Some told by other authors on writing, some new. To hear it from a great writer is all the better.    I part with King when he says plot has no part in creative writing. It has. But probably a lesser role in horror fiction, where the shocks need to be more spontaneous. It seems clear to me that King does plot. He just doesn't dwell on it. Kings advice may be good for the genre in which he excels. Horror. Read it carefully and there is something for every writer.     I also part company with King when he argues that writers are born not learnt. That is nonsense. We can all learn if we work at it as hard as King has. If we are in the right place at the right time with the right story then every writer can be as successful as King. That is the luck of the draw. King admits it himself and his life shows that writers learn.     Kings greatest advice is edit, edit and edit. He bangs on about it. Rightly so.    Section 3, King calls `On Living'. Some critics complain that King goes on and on about the accident that nearly killed him. Walking up the road King was hit by a stupid van driver. Motorists get away far too easily. So I am pleased that King does go on about it. It's a revealing account of what it's like to be such a victim. Even here, the menace of King's writing rises from the ashes. He explains that at the end of writing the driver had died. For some inexplicable reason! Good for King.      A great book. A real laugh. A fascinating biography by one of today's greatest writers. Some great advice, showing that the best way to teach, is to entertain.    For Horror fans, 'On Writing' may sadly be the beginning of the end of King's horror stories. He has stepped out of the shadows, breaking the spell. King is a damn good writer and he shows in 'On Writing' that he is capable of writing in othergenres. The name King is now the brand for excellence on horror, so he will probably have to change his name to change his genre.         just Jack
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Narrated by David Attenborough, one of the signature narrators in the history of documentaries, you will be pulled in to the beauty that is the very planet we live on. Nothing short of fantastic, all of the images are beautifully crafted and set. You can most assuredly tell that many, many years-worth of time were put into the making of this production. Even if you've never seen a documentary before, this set will keep you mesmerized. For those who are more seasoned, this is your paradise. It is nothing short of incredible. While it is obvious that a few shots were not done in 1080p, most of the footage has incredible detail and color. Your search for the most fantastic documentary of recent time is over.
B00003CWRX|5.0|One of the most important stories of the 20th century.     It didn't just change 'big tobacco'. It changed corporate ethics. Just look at the more ethical behaviour of 'big alcohol' today and you can trace its roots to the story of The Insider. It is an education to everyone in business. The events re-established the independence and proper role of the press as one of the pillars of civilised society.     Consumers world wide owe a great debt to Dr. Geoffrey Wigand, (the whistle blower) and Lowell Bergman, (the 60 Minutes producer). Two men who put their careers, even their lives on the line for an ethical principle and in defence of society. There are few such men or women. Their example should be emulated by all.     One of the best films of the 20th century. Such a story deserves excellence in its telling. Sharpe, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Appropriately dramatised, the characterisation is convincing. This is not just a simple linear story, but multi-layered. To see the layers you need to watch it more than once. One layer missed by most reviewers is the contrast between the wives of the two men. One understanding and supporting, the other self-interested. The inevitable consequences are shown. How true to life we do not know, but that back story is worthy of its inclusion. If you want to learn the craft of story telling, be it in print radio or film, then learn from The Insider. Thanks to Michael Mann, Russell Crow and Al Pacino for its brilliant telling.    This is a story that should be known world-wide. A film that should be watched world-wide again and again. It is perfection is social education. A griping tale that teaches us all how to behave.     Dr. Wigand and Mr. Bergman, I salute you.     just Jack
0679746323|5.0|...they`ll do anything to discredit it's authors or anyone who says anything good about it.    Were there ever an antithesis of Mao's \\"Little Red Book,\\" it is perhaps \\"Mao: The Unknown Story,\\" which itself could be dubbed the \\"Big Red Book,\\" although it does not portend to be idealistic.     If you read this book, review it with your honest opinion, but be forewarned, there is a concerted effort by Mao defenders to discredit anyone who says anything positive about this book (just watch the \\"not helpful\\" votes roll in on this review). It's not the best book, to be sure, but it is worth reading (I only give it 5 stars to offset the garbage negative reviews, otherwise its a solid 4-star book).     For some, this will present a daunting read at some 800+ pages, but well over 150 of those pages are dedicated to notes, source material, bibliographical information and index, which will knock it down to a respectable 630 or so pages. Such extensive source material lends a great deal more credibility to the information than what critical commentators are likely to produce in kind. If only a fraction of \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\" is true it would arguably reveal the world's most despotic, self indulgent, murderous and coldhearted regimes if not personalities.   Jung Chang and Jon Halliday have compiled an exhaustive resource of the Mao story that spans his entire life and career. The book is broken down into many small chapters that frequently overlap each other to focus on pivotal events that otherwise would be lost in a simultaneous treatment. These small chapters make it easy reading for Western readers who might otherwise bog down in sometimes troublesome Chinese names.   Mao's apparent disdain for his own people and culture, which China can easily claim unparalleled richness, amounts to atrocities which are equally unparalleled in world history.   \\"Mao: The Unknown Story,\\" depicts Mao as an opportunistic, self absorbed, womanizing bully, who truly and rightfully feared hispeople nearly as much as they feared him. Mao himself is not depicted as a deep thinking philosopher, but more of a conniving political saboteur who ruled with less of an iron fist than an obedient pack of Rottweilers.   The book's astounding casualty figures are as troubling as the numbers of surviving Chinese who tolerated the brutality. Certainly Mao's carnage could have easily been matched by Chiang Kai-shek had the shoe been on another foot. There is considerable evidence that Chiang could have been as at least as much of a tyrant as Mao.   The fact that so many Chinese bought into the Mao phenomenon and personality cult is a testament to the psychosis of group think and mob mentality on the grandest scale. Perhaps one might argue that to rule a nation of so many people one must deny individuality or at least sacrifice it for the \\"stability\\" China's Communist Party seems to have enjoyed.   There is little doubt that the curtain Mao pulled China behind remains reluctant to show the west much of the reality that it experiences.   Diplomatically, the lessons of \\"Mao: The Unknown Story,\\" are useful in analyzing the modern world and protecting against future despotic regimes while helping to recognize existing ones.   Insightful, wide-ranging, and well organized. REVIEW EVERY BOOK YOU READ, AUTHORS AND READERS DESERVE YOUR OPINIONS TOO!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|I love this movie!  Great acting, scenery, and love story!  Ralph Fiennes is so hot, too!
B000O75F7C|5.0|Ive been hooked on this band for almost 2 years now, originally addicted to THE SKY MOVES SIDEWAYS before drifting into LIGHBULB SUN, IN ABSENTIA, and DEADWING. With FEAR OF A BLANK PLANET the band once again proves that they are so incredibly talented as musicians that it only makes me wonder why so few people know who this band is. FOABP is the essence of progressive music. Every track compliments the others on this release. I have listened to this CD hundreds of times and still cant pick my favorite song as I love them all....ok I pick ANESTHETIZE, \\"the 17 min monster\\" :) If you are a Pink Floyd fan (thats how I started listening to this group) or a progrock fan, check this band out!
B000Q67DEO|5.0|...to the enormous explosion of Parallel Lines.  Eat to the Beat was the first album I ever bought and it's still, IMHO, the best Blondie album to date.  Whereas Parallel Lines was the pouring of the Heart (of Glass) and Soul of the band into the album, giving everything it had, Eat to the Beat is the victory dance.  The band here is tighter, faster, more raucous, and more fun.  Parallel Lines still had various forays into a number of styles, putting them through a Blondie filter.  On ETTB, the style is Blondie itself.  These songs are as fresh and contemporary-sounding today as they were the first time I heard them on Chrysalis cassette on my one-speaker boombox.<br /><br />As far as the video is concerned, the production is of course much more rudimentary by today's standards.  Quite honestly, I don't care.  I want to watch the band.  DAH in the softcore bondage outfit in \\"The Hardest Part\\" is far more titillating than most of what passes for \\"hot\\" today.  We also see, for example, what a wonderful drummer Clem Burke is and the value of a guitarist (Frank Infante) who doesn't feel the need to assault the audience with his instrument in order to get his message across.

The only problem is that you want more than 13 episodes included in this set. The first two seasons of The Practice was the best.  Buy this and you won't be disappointed. Guest stars such as Linda Hunt and Ed Asner are great.

B000058983|5.0|\\"Forever Changes\\" has appeared on the \\"top 100 album lists\\" of many major rock reviewers. Why? There are elements of other great bands in this album, which raises the old \\"which came first?\\" conundrum. The simplist and safest resolution to this argument is to say that these bands (THE DOORS, BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD, etc,) were all influenced by, worked in, and contributed to the \\"melting pot\\" (no pun intended) that was the LA music scene at that time. In addition, there are even a few \\"touches\\" of British influence here, but those were also evident on their first album. Overall, this is an album that is unique enough to have withstood the test of time and continues to provide aural pleasures to new listeners. It has been suggested that drug use may have contributed to the oblique lyrics on this album and, yes, the breakup of the original (and best) incarnation of this band. Beyond this explanation, however, is the poetic aspects of the lyrics which allow us to impose and fill in our own intrepretations of the songs. That quality has contributed to their lasting appeal and is at the base of much good art. Like all great artists (whether it is Picasso or the Beatles) it was their ability to combine old things in new ways that made them unique and transcend the obvious and mundane. You either tell a great and universal story that everyone can relate to or you create an environment in/on which people can superimpose their own experiences. LOVE could certainly tell a straightforward rock and roll tale, but it stood out for its ability to do the latter.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This is the original cast album from the Broadway show first produced in 2003 - music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, book by Winne Holzman based on the original novel by Gregory Maguire.<br /><br />Subtle it aint but their are many musical highlights - \\"Popular\\", \\"A Sentimental Man\\", \\"Defying Gravity\\", and my own personal favourite \\"I'm Not That Girl\\".<br /><br />The accompanying booklet is unhelpful in that it explains nothing about the plot of the musical.<br /><br />The performances are excellent, so if you loved the show you will not be disappointed.
B000002AGB|5.0|The Who's performance at the 1970 Isle of Wight festival was phenominal.  In my opinion, it is better than their \\"Live At Leeds\\" concert.  Leeds seemed to be more polished, but Isle of Wight shows more of the authenticity of The Who's early-day live performances.  The music is played with much energy, and the banter between songs gives it more of an actual concert flavor, unlike Leeds.  The Leeds concert sounds like a studo album that just happened to have an audience.    Not only is this a superior performance to Leeds, it is also a better CD release.  Leeds omitted songs, chopped up other songs, was presented out of order, and was re-released with inferior sound quality.  Isle of Wight has none of those qualities, and is a perfect release in every way.  Of course, die hard fans will want both this and Leeds, but if you are trying to choose, this is easily  the better buy.
1573921394|5.0|Published in 1936 during the height of the the Great Depression, Keynes's \\"General Theory\\" is widely credited, rightly or wrongly, as being the theory that actually pointed out how to end the Depression.  It has never been out of print since its first publication.<br /><br />The volume you're getting here hasn't much in terms of being \\"reader friendly.\\"  There is a brief (2-page) introduction.  There are no footnotes (other than Keynes's original ones), and no helpful commentary or other aid that would help make Keynes's book more comprehensible to the general reader.  So you're basically getting the bare bones.<br /><br />But the book can be very tough going, even for those with extensive preparation in economics.  It has plenty of nasty equations and there are more thistles than you'll find in an English hedgerow. In brief, it's one of those universally heralded classics that many pay lip service to but few have ever read.<br /><br />As for whether this is \\"the book that ended the Depression,\\" I'm not so sure.  There were many competing theories floating around during the Depression, and Keynes's was only one of those.<br /><br />While Keynes's recipe of counteracting a decline in private spending with an increase in government spending turned out to be what Roosevelt (and Hitler) actually did, certainly the war would have come along whether or not Keynes published his book.  Hence governments would have stumbled upon \\"the Keynesian solution\\" on their own anyway.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The sound on this CD is incredibly clear and rich.  It's like having the group in your living room.  Unbelievable, and the nuances are great from George and Giles Martin.
B00008IAMD|5.0|The man's last effort, he gave it all he had left, you can feel it in his voice.  Profound, perhaps partly because it was his last, but profound nonetheless.  This CD includes his version of Trent Reznor's Hurt, a song I had hoped no one would ever condescend to cover, but the song was almost written just for him, it's haunting.  In the liner note he descibes how he spent the last few months of his life working on the title track, taking longer to compose than any other song of his life, like he knew it was his last and wanted to give it his all.  If you only own one Cash album, especially if, like myself, you're not a country western sort, consider this one.
1594489505|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Hosseini really has the ability to pull you into the story!  I found that I really cared alot about the characters in this story. It's really amazing all of the hardships that the Afghan people (especially the women)have endured.   I had a little problem when he rapidly shifted from the first woman character (Mariam) to the second woman character (Laila). I was a little annoyed that I had to shift to this other character when I was still interested in what was happening to the first character.  I think that Hosseini could have transitioned this piece better.   Even though I had a problem his transitioning of his characters, I think Hosseini has a wonderful way with words.  He's able to capture so much of the emotions and atmosphere of the setting in ways that are often very subtle.  The reader is allowed to come to their own conclusion of what Laila or Mariam are feeling by Hosseini's description of them sharing a tea time for the first time after a traumatic experience.  This book leaves me wanting more Hosseini books.  Great author !

B000MGUZM0|4.0|It was inevitable that the Arcade Fire wouldn't be able to live up to the hype. Not that they were incapable, but that the expectations were at a staggering height (like \\"Phantom Menace\\" big). But that doesn't qualify it as a disappointment. Instead, the band changes up their dynamic and forgoes the frequent epics in favor of sturdier songs and suites. The emotion is far darker this time and while the passion hasn't ebbed, the sound is more frequently but not always streamlined. It's a tighter record on the whole, and its lesser moments are never dull (admit it: \\"In the Backseat\\" on Funeral could be pretty wearisome). The biggest surprise is the lack of slow and great builds, towering crescendos, swells and releases, and sudden explosions. There are tempo and melody changes to be sure, but they're much subtler, far more natural. As a result, while there are only one or two songs on here that aren't great even after the first listen, none have the towering scale and intense drama of epic crowd-pleasers like \\"Neighborhood #3\\" and \\"Rebellion.\\"     But there are plenty of gems here: \\"Keep the Car Running\\" is one of their catchiest and most straightforward rockers, \\"Intervention\\" rolls and rumbles for a while before soaring, \\"No Cars Go\\" gives the listener the passionate release they've been expecting (and the best place to go for Funeral fanatics who whine about the new sound), and \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\" is a compact epic, running the gamut of sound and emotion in a tidy four minute package. Most glaring flaw: just as Funeral closer \\"In the Backseat\\" is lacking, so is this album's final track, \\"My Body Is a Cage.\\" Why didn't they just end it after the cathartic \\"No Cars Go\\"?    Best cuts: \\"The Well and the Lighthouse,\\" \\"No Cars Go,\\" \\"Keep the Car Running,\\" \\"Intervention,\\" \\"Black Mirror,\\" \\"Ocean of Noise,\\" \\"(Antichrist Television Blues),\\" \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations,\\" \\"Windowsill\\"
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This BBC series \\"Planet Earth\\" is one of the most beautiful productions I've seen.  After seeing a few episodes on PBS, being able to see this in wide-screen HD format is an unbelievable experience.  My 15 year old son and 9 year old daughter have been completely enraptured, and she actually pleads to watch it again (quite a step up from Sponge Bob, etc.).
B000NQR7NO|3.0|Sure, the Arctics' debut wasn't that bad, but it felt a lot worse considering how much love the press and hype machines were throwing their way. They weren't rock and roll saviors; they were a decent but thoroughly middle of the road outfit with a couple of catchy tunes. Now that a year plus has passed, the world is already searching for the next big thing. The Arctics released a fame-is-killing-me EP (which I skipped) and now they might as well make a where-did-the-fame-go? record after this one.     Astonishingly, the Arctics come roaring out of the gates on the first track, \\"Brainstorm.\\" A band that once seemed snide and snotty (a la Libertines) seems to actually care about grinding their guitars and pushing energy to its audience instead of sucking it away. There's a good and bad about that opening: thankfully, they don't try to repeat that notion again and again; unfortunately, that's the best song. Yes. The best. A driving punkish number that opens the album. After that, they coast through on mostly okay and better musical exercises, but for all the stuttering beats and post-punk flairs, they never reach that same mark again. Lucky for them that they're musically gifted enough so it's not immediately noticeable.    But music isn't enough, and even the punchy rhythm of \\"Teddy Picker\\" is brought down by hypocritical rants, \\"This House Is a Circus\\" uses the \\"word\\" berserkus for a rhyme(!), and the laughable story of the trying-too-hard \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" turns a forgettable track into an awful one. On the other end of the spectrum, \\"Only Ones Who Knows\\" is relatively well-said but drags along with a sluggish melody that's more likely to put one to sleep than to make one feel something. If Arctic Monkeys hope to have any shot at earning the accolades they once drowned in, they'd better do it fast. Remember when everyone loved the Strokes? And how often do you hear people talking about them in the present tense? And hell, those guys actually DESERVED most oftheir attention back then.    Best cuts: \\"Brainstorm,\\" \\"Do Me a Favour,\\" \\"Old Yellow Bricks,\\" \\"If You Were There, Beware,\\" \\"D Is For Dangerous,\\" \\"The Bad Thing\\"
B00005JPAO|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said about this wonderful film? I was surprised at how narrow it was in it's scope; no Fergie or Andrew, not much else but the immediate royal family and the Blairs. That's what makes it great--it's a glimpse into the tiny world that they live in every day. Even the princes were more \\"background\\" than characters. Loved the whole \\"hunting\\" metaphor and the emotional reaction of the Queen to the stag. Ironic. All performances are spectacular; I personally thought Blair's wife was hysterical. The real footage that was interdispersed throughout the film was wonderful and brought back so many memories. Sniff. You'll love this film.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|Now that hard rock seems to be in its death throes, even a minor effort from a good hard rocker can seem exceptional simply because of the gaping dearth of quality releases. As a result, the new album by Queens of the Stone Age, Era Vulgaris (which doesn't mean what you probably think it means), may well go down as the best hard rock album of the year even if it falls short of the standard set by this still relatively young band. Frontman Josh Homme has been in the game long enough by now to have learned a few things, but that doesn't make his output any more streamlined or ponderous. He still cranks out all the vicious riffs and sleaze he can manage, but the band's more playful, winking side takes a hit this time around. Homme and crew are like depraved hedonists baked under the sun, nursing recently acquired STDs and recovering from a week-long hangover.    Performance-wise, they're still having plenty of fun, but by slowing things down, darkening the mood, and pushing the grooves to hard extremes found somewhere in the basement of whatever studio-of-the-damned they shambled together before recording, they don't always show it. By drifting from the good times, they seem to be seeking a smaller, more hardcore audience, but the album's tracklist plays mostly like really good B-sides that couldn't fit into earlier releases. True, there's a mostly consistent sound, but its bottom-feeding abandon smells like leftovers dressed up as first run main courses. For the first time ever, it actually requires a patient effort to wade through this mire. Lucky for us that along the way they manage more moments battling with swamp things and spotting naked chicks floating by in a bong-shaped canoe than time spent in venomous sludge and being sucked down to the bottom of the bog.    Despite being one of the album's best bets, \\"Make It Wit Chu\\" is like a fragmented amalgam of Motown and the Stones, and not really much like the rest of the record (fans will probably recognize it froma few years back when its fetal form was done by Desert Sessions, Homme's side project). The stuttering beat of \\"I'm Designer\\" is searching for a strong hook, but plods on as a good song that nevertheless fails to ever really grab hold and become great. \\"Battery Acid\\" is (naturally) corrosive, and an unsuccessful plunge into a grinding, metallic sound (contrast it with album highlight, \\"Misfit Love,\\" to see how this approach can work well).    It's the band's most difficult record to date, a grim and grimy spectacle that rarely strikes right away, but it's easy to commit yourself to repeated listens where the good parts grow. At times, it seems to be borrowing from pages too close to Homme, though--there's a piece of a guitar riff in \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" that sounds a lot like a section of Songs-session drummer Dave Grohl's \\"All My Life\\"; he performs an obvious former-Grohl gig Nirvana lift on \\"3s & 7s\\"; when he says \\"run\\" in \\"Run Pig Run,\\" it's delivered exactly the same as the chorus in Mastodon's \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" (Homme is a big fan of that group). These failings, as well as the second half filler (\\"River in the Road\\") that also marred Lullabies, make Era their least impressive effort since their debut. But just like when other all-time great bands like Zeppelin (Presence), Pearl Jam (Binaural), the Who (The Who By Numbers), and Nine Inch Nails (With Teeth) follow up a string of stellar albums with one that's merely very good instead of great, it just feels worse by comparison. Is Era in the same league as the last three Queens albums? No. Is it worth seeking out, especially by fans? Definitely.    Best cuts: \\"Misift Love,\\" \\"Make It Wit Chu,\\" \\"Turning on the Screw,\\" \\"Sick, Sick, Sick,\\" \\"Into the Hollow,\\" \\"Suture Up Your Future,\\" \\"3s & 7s,\\" \\"I'm Designer,\\" \\"Run Pig Run\\"
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|Let me first say, I was totally into Clarkson's previous album Breakaway, it rocked from start to finish, and granted i didnt think she could follow it up with a better album, but i really expected a stronger showing than this pretty good CD, I've read all the drama in its making and the fact that Clive Davis is going to sink this CD, and if you've noticed how little airplay the first single is getting you know that this is true, it's the best song on the CD and it's hardly been noticed by radio..should be an interesting summer for Kelly, her tour scrapped by Davis and she in his dog house...but im sure she will end up fine and im betting her next album is her best yet...as for this one..i think Kelly rocks, so ill give her a break and hope her next album is a BREAKAWAY.

0385340559|5.0|Big, mean, and totally loyal to his friends.  That's Jack Reacher.  Lee Child has another winner in Bad Luck and Trouble.  In this installment of the Reacher saga we learn more about Jack's earlier life, and how when his old unit calls Jack comes a'running.  A man of few means and fewer words he is not to be trifled with especially when members of his old military unit start turning up dead.  A mix of today's terrorism and bad cops gone worse, Jack and the remnants of his old army investigative unit seek out and destroy the evil ones.  And in the end, like always, Jack simply gets on a bus and heads to nowhere.  All I can say is Mr. Child you are one brilliant writer.  I read this amazing book in two nights and can't wait for the next Reacher adventure in Play Dirty.<br />Bad Luck and Trouble is a tight plot with quick dialog and fast action.  The interplay of Jack's old military colleagues makes for a fascinating study of group dynamics and investigative techniques.  The story takes place in Los Angeles and at times I kept expecting Harry Bosch to turn up and give Jack a run for his money.  Overall one of Mr. Child's best Jack Reacher novels.<br />Excellent character development.  Mr. Child keeps introducing new facets to Jack's life that keeps him fresh and interesting.  Meeting his old Army investigative unit was a treat and I hope we see more of them as they each have an interesting personality.<br />No gratuitous violence, sex, or language.  Some graphic violence but hey that's Jack's way and without it the story would be flat.<br />Must read!  One of Mr. Child's best.  Very entertaining for anytime or place.  A mega page turner.

B000N3T0DW|5.0|The beauty of life is magnificently captured in legendary director Pedro Almodóvar's latest international sensation, \\"Volver.\\" Almodóvar is known for his quirky, fascinating and extremely moving films that appeal to all people of all cultures. \\"Volver\\" is his best film to date, and it is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen in my life.     I was truly touched by \\"Volver.\\" The cast is absolutely amazing; for those of you who are not of Hispanic or Spanish origin, it's important for me to stress how much of an icon both Almodóvar, Carmen Maura (Irene), Penélope Cruz (Raimunda) and Blanca Portillo (Augustina) are. This cast, and the director, are the best that Spain, and the international film scene, can offer.    The story is so moving, so adventurous, so captivating that, if I were to disclose even one small tid-bit of information about how the movie begins or how the plot develops, I would be revealing too much. You will have to trust me when I say that this is a powerful movie about the bonds that form between generations of women, women struggling with life's many trials and tribulations.    Seeing this movie released internationally has truly been an amazing experience for all people of Latin heritage, as the prowess of the Spanish film scene is finally being revealed.    If you ever had a doubt about watching \\"Volver,\\" remove it from your mind, and watch \\"Volver\\" now!
B00006JJ51|5.0|This is where it all began for Dr. Dre and Ice Cube.  This album was pretty much what catapulted their careers into the future of Hip Hop music. This album was a right up in your face in every aspect.  Dealing with everything from gang violence, the drug problem to the injustice's of law enforcement officials. This is a true Hip Hop classic to have in one's archives, especially if you came through that era.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|How come America missed out on such intelligent Presidental potential. A great humanitarian with even greater sense of purpose - what the world needs now. How I value my copy of An Inconvenient Truth even though I was late to purchase it. Not TOO late one hopes.

The principals in this book if adopted will lead one to even greater success in their lives. Having the free tickets to attend a Harv Ecker conference provide a great incentive to purchase this book.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Extreme disappointment in this one. Huge fan of Linkin Park's previous work. More than 50% of this CD are ballads. The only two good songs are Given Up and Bleed it Out. They even dive into the political cliche with another anti-War song (Hands Held High) bashing who else, but our president. If you are going to go there you better come with Green Day quality, otherwise you are the Dixie Chicks. Do not waste your time on this CD.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Old time drama comes alive with this exceptional performance of magic and love.  The actors are exceptional and make you believe you are really back in the day of magicians and when people truly believed witchcraft may be at hand.<br /><br />I will not spoil the ending, because it is a good one.  The progression of the movie included a demonstration from Ed Norton to Paul Giamatti on how a simple magic trick is really done.  This sets you up to wonder about the rest of the magic.  Is it so simple or is Norton MORE than an illusionist?<br /><br />The romantic side of the story has been done so many times; childhood boys loves girl, meets her later in life, still loves her.  However, it is integrated in this movie so well that it makes the movie into a romance you really buy into.<br /><br />This movie is worth beyond a rental, because I am making a bet, you'll lend it to someone else raving over how good it is!
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|Want to know why 73% of people who bought this DVD bought the Ultimate version next? Its becasue they (like me) didn't know they were getting the version with the Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. His soundtrack STINKS! It ruined the entire movie. Not only that but this version has edited out the really cool scenes of Tim Curry in the black light---gone. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage get the version with the great soundtrack from tangerine dream.
B00005JPD0|4.0|`D&eacute;j&agrave; vu' released in '05 stars some of my favorite male stars active today; Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer and James Caviezel. Add to the roster the talented Adam Goldberg and the devastatingly attractive Paula Patton and you've got all the ingredients necessary to provide a truly great viewing experience. Unfortunately even with a cast of this caliber the film doesn't quite deliver all the potential it could have.<br /><br />Time travel movies are always popular but could be a little tricky at times. I think the script handles the scientific explanation of time travel and warping space surprisingly well but some sequences are a little too unrealistic and you can ask an audience to suspend reality for only so long. I also found the ending to make no sense whatsoever so that definitely is a minus. On the positive side, the romantic angle works wonderfully and Denzel Washington's love interest Paula Patton is drop dead gorgeous. `D&eacute;j&agrave; vu' combines the futuristic vision of `Minority Report' (`02) with the romantic longing of the '44 classic `Laura'. Not too bad a combination don't you think?<br /><br />Repeatability Factor: Well worth at least one viewing but that's about it unless you're watching just to see Paula again.
1594200823|5.0|On UCTV, UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism professor Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore's Dilemma, (see online UCTV digital video file archive to view), focuses on the thematic proposition that a corn monoculture or any other food monoculture is unsustainable because it depends on a degree of pesticide and herbicide and fungicide use that wipes out what I think he termed maritime culture, or the aquatic culture of lakes, streams, rivers, marshes, and a large region of ocean beyond every river delta.    \\"Unsustainable\\" in that context takes on more than a meaning of aesthetically displeasing to a small portion of an educated elite. Unsustainable means monoculture is life-threatening to this species.    It seems trifling in comparison for a couple of reviewers to piddle about vegan distinctions when the book was not titled The Vegan Dilemma, was it? Not one word about the forest, just the trees, when the strategic big picture is that corn mono-culture is not just something for elitists to sniff snoot about.    If you do not know why simply killing all the aquaculture is life threatening, you could read Desperation Medicine by Dr. Richie Shoemaker. Pfisteria and many other diseases result from mono-culture and factory-farming, because herbicides and pesticides cultivate organisms that prey on humans. That is not a matter of kosher, as one reviewer suggests, or elite yuppie esoterics, or of interest only to vegans, as the reviewers who get lost in the trees and fail to see the forest or strategic point. Maybe unviable would be a better term than unsustainable. Mono-culture is unviable for reasons best explained by Dr. Shoemaker and his friends at NIH and CDC.    I am in the region of Polyface farm. As far as feeding an elite who can afford to make such distinctions as organic, truly free range as opposed to a warehouse with an unused exercise yard, and grass fed, I do not see anybody but upper middle class buying raw milk and grass fed beef. Eggs, even truefree range eggs, are cheap, though!    I also know a lot of inner city underclass people, and they will take all of the organic food they can get. Unfortunately the Whole Foods store is not in their part of town, and they cannot afford to shop there. They understand the issue as one of life-threatening and health-threatening as well as real food tasting different and essentially having healing properties, since the corporatist alternative causes illness.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I watched most of the series \\" The Planet Earth \\" in Blue Ray and I still am thrilled, I loved the cinematography , the voice of the narrator \\"David Attenborough\\" and his passionate style,makes you wonder if he was there in the middle of the scene.It seemed like he was reading a poem from a play by Shakespeare, which keeps you interested in watching this ageless documentary.  I recommend it highly. I will be watching it many more times as an unwinding therapy or a relaxing mantra or whatever that moment calls for, maybe a spiritual experience .
0316067598|5.0|The fact that the United States is still producing young men of this caliber who are willing to put it all on the line for US gives me hope for the future. There are so many people who live in the United Staes today that seem to be self loathing and freedom hating. Thank God there are still some patriot heroes in our country that understand that we are at war with evil and we must fight back or lose everything we stand for. Marcus Luttrell also pinpoints the enemy within our country that seems to want us to lose to this evil. At its core though this is a story of heroes that don't know the meaning of the words 'surrender' and 'quit'. The story of these men reads like a fanstastic action novel with the exception that it really happened. How far can a human push themselves under the most adverse circumstances? I had no idea till I read this book. This book will make (should make) every citizen of the United States proud of the men and women who serve US in the uniformed services. If you're like me and don't have alot of time for casual reading, make this book your one 'must read' this year. You will not regret it.
1600240003|4.0|I have read all the Harry Bosch books and really love the stories and the writing.  This, too is a good story, but beeing an enhancement of a series that was in the paper makes it read like an abridgment rather than the full fleshed out work of the other stories.  It is worth the the time.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I was a bit surprised at the sound of this album at first because most of the songs are not what my ears (and probably moste peoples) are used to hearing.  The first two cuts are very much like her old stuff, what you would expect but as the album goes on it gets harder and edgier.  I LOVE IT!!!  The lyrics are wonderful and the beats are all catchy.  It took a couple of serious listens before I got it.  Now I can't stop listening.  Maybe was the one song that I had to really give time.  And then Can I have a Kiss took a little while too but not as long.  This cd is the bomb.  Her vocals are amazing.  You can rock to it.  You can relate to it.  And it's nice to see that she points the blame at herself in a lot of the cuts.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|With standard definition and HD definition on the other side, I can play it on my Toshiba HD DVD player and the kids can play it on their regular player. It's a win-win and an awesome movie to boot. This combo disc is the one to get, I can play it anywhere.<br /><br />*The reviews here are on the content of the film. Ignore the trolling by Blu-Ray fanboys.
B000Q6GXW2|4.0|There isn't a lot of love for combos, but I like them.  During the transition to HD most of us will have several DVD players, but maybe only one HD DVD player.  That and very few (if any!) of our buddies have HD.  So this disc you can pack up and watch it over at your best friends house on his 27 inch CRT TV that he bought for $1200 in 1990.    The movie is worth the cost of this disc.  Even for the over 30 crowd.

0385522401|5.0|On Chesil Beach is first of all a new take on the romantic story - a la the earliest English novels - and it's told in an epistolary manner, i.e. virtually all narrative. The importance of the latter point is that narrative in the modern, commercial novel is there, of course, to give scenic details, but largely to take a brief break from the intensity of close-point-of-view dialogue passages. McEwan, in his most recent novels, including this one, evokes this sense of seventeenth and eighteenth century narrators, who are as much a part of the story as the direct characters. But he doesn't bring his narrators into a sufficiently sharp focus to accomplish that. On the other hand, in On Chesil Beach, he couldn't have portrayed Florence and Edward's interiors this well through dialogue while placing them within the larger context of a sea change in Western culture's Sixties metamorphosis.<br />His purpose is clearly not to affect change in his culture, as the English novel's middle period hoped to do. For him, it seems enough to place his characters in a setting requiring the reader to compare that time and place with today and draw his/her own conclusions, based on the psychological territory he maps of both Florence and Edward. In doing so, his strategy and literary ethos wanders from those of a period piece to novelistic modernity.<br />In his treatment, McEwan pays homage to the modern novel by wandering back and forth through the story's part-of-one-day timeline to provide backstory and the past histories that quickly doom Florence's and Edward's marriage. Only at the story's end does he allow linear time, and even then he leaps vertiginously from that singular early evening of 1962 to the present time.<br />Some readers may see this book as a broadside on another English chestnut - repressed sexuality. McEwan allows Florence and Edward to react to an unsatisfactory wedding night consummation in opposite ways - ways that never lead either to a fully fleshed life. It's true that he teases the reader with this repression. However, the point McEwan seems to be making is deeper: the realities of ordinary life always trump the romantic illusions upon which both individual life and - in this case, British society - are/have been built. As this reality rears its sometimes-ugly head, personal and societal decay may occur if one or both fail to adapt to mature from dreamtime to eyes-wide-open life.<br />Some may complain that McEwan is advocating the sexual freedom characteristic of the late Sixties in this novel, a freedom that has developed more than its share of warts over then last half-century. But he seems to imply something broader - that even this tainted freedom is to be preferred to the inner repressiveness that has historically led individuals to fey lives and fatally damaged psyches.<br />He is clearly aware of his place in the English novel's lineage, even to the point of creating a grammatically awkward opening for his story, an opening symbolic of the story's totality. He knows the English novel's evolution, and he delineates it in an obvious but fluid fashion in On Chesil Beach. For this reason, Ian McEwan deserves the title the London Sunday Times has recently foisted off on him as \\"our national writer.\\"<br />My complaints? Only two, and they are minor. First, the story ends as Edward's, with scarcely a mention of Florence and her seemingly impaired future life. And the author seems all too gleeful in his portrayal on this young pair's sexual awkwardness. It's as though he has lived this awkwardness, or has seen it in overwhelming fashion about him, thankful that it has passed into history.<br />To have accomplished all of the above in such a concise manner isn't easy. Too, McEwan is breathing new life into the novella, a task literary writing has dearly needed, and On Chesil Beach is testimony to his ability to shape the prose of future generations even as he settles comfortably into its present state of affairs.t he teases the reader with this repression.

B000OYC3J8|5.0|All of their albums have their own flavor or style and this one catches the rocky 70's feel that came out in several of their earlier songs like Screwdriver and Pretty good looking.  I'm not going to review every single song but I will say that I am the biggest White Stripes fan I know and I was expecting big things from this album... and they completely blew my expectations out of the water.  5 stars, 10 if I could give them.
B00005JPFC|5.0|Ratatouille, the recipe, is a simple dish made with common ingredients. It's \\"peasant food,\\" as one of the chefs haughtily sniffs. When perfect ingredients and flawless preparation come together, those common parts transform into something special if not magical. In other words, the dish is the ideal metaphor for this movie.<br /><br />The common ingredients include the boy who struggles up from nowhere to triumph in a fiercely competitive world (two, actually, Alfredo and Remy), the love interest off to a rocky start, art supreme over crass commercialism, and cute fuzzy animals - assuming you think rats are cute, which isn't necessary. The transformation comes in part from the technical excellence of the animation, but even that kind of excellence is the regular thing these days. The real magic comes from Pixar's characters, visual literacy, and ability to offer something fun to viewers of many ages. You won't just be a chaperone if you bring the kids, wishing you were elsewhere. You'll be caught up in it too.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
1591391105|5.0|It just makes sense, and is very thorough. Many things I would not have thought about, or gotten around to thinking about - we live in such a fast paced world that it would have been a challenge to do. Luckily, I had a cross country trip, so this gave me the time to read this book and compile my \\"list\\" of notes and apply them to my upcoming job change. Bottom line - many good new perspectives that I simply would not have thought of. Highly recommended.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I wish I were eloquent enough to convey just how much I loved and apprecciated the feelings this movie evoked in me when I watched it the first time.  Each dream or vignette is distinct and yet somehow connected.  My favorite was the 'peach orchard' segment.  It was so stunningly beautiful it brought me to tears.  The colors were unparalleled and the message was clearly yet sensitively conveyed.  It is not a movie with the traditional beginning, middle and end.  It is separate 'dream' sequences that fit together in an unusual but highly effective way. I love all of Kurosawa's movies, but this is a special piece I will hold in my heart forever.
B000002L7Y|3.0|You know how the story goes.  Obscure European band labors in obscurity for years.  Somehow, through sheer chance, has one track (which may or may not be typical of their work) hit it stateside and rocket up the charts.  Make them megastars, a household name...until their one hit dies out and they never come close to striking gold again.    Yes, before Aqua, there was the strangely similar-sounding A-ha, and this was an otherwise perfectly ordinary album where their one shining star (which I always suspected became popular mainly due to the unbelievable range on the chorus part) came from.    Not much else to say.  Typical, ordinary synthpop, what I'd call \\"waiting room music\\".  The singer, despite his best efforts, has some trouble with the English language.  I've heard a lot worse, but it's no surprise why A-ha never could find its niche here.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Well its been a little over a year since this CD came out. And it took some getting used to at first, and I don't think a lot of people appreciated it upon its first listen. I had some difficulty as well. I was stunned by Lateralus, which remains as the greatest CD I ever bought, and have ever heard. Its music of my generation.<br /><br />Anyway, 10,000 Days I think was surrounded by too high of expectations, and I'm very guilty of that myself. There was so much speculation going into it (decoy albums, fake song titles, a second release in late summer (?), hidden messages, etc.) and all of it was just so far fetched that people were without a doubt disappointed with the final product. But after you let go of what it \\"should\\" have been, and embrace it for what it is, you'll find this to be just as good as Aenima and Undertow. I don't think it surpasses Lateralus, or even Aenima, but its nestled right on the same line as Undertow and Opiate, in my opinion.<br /><br />Vicarious opens it up, and it immediately reminds me of Schism. Schism being probably one of 3 Tool songs, the non-fan would know. I think Vicarious is a poor choice for an opener to a CD, but its an effective song, if not a bit predictable. Its by far my least favorite on the CD, and even when I first heard it on the radio a year ago, I was slightly worried. It seemed to be a cross between A Perfect Circle's lyrical themes, and Tool's music. A toned down, diluted radio vehicle, one that would be easily accessible for non-fans, and moderately acceptable to die-hards. Nevertheless, its a well structured song with a decent chorus, and a pretty good finale. It starts out bland, but picks up and by the end of it, you can't say its a bad song, but its far from amazing, and by far to me, the worst on the album (\\"worst\\" for lack of a better word). This was the first single off  of 10,000 Days, and it was a decent choice, but like I said, it doesn't represent the album that well.<br /><br />The minute I heard Jambi, I fell in love with it. To me, this is best song on the album. How odd that the extremes for me happen at the start of the CD? Anyway, its driving, its pulsating, and it just strikes you as being a Tool song. Its wicked live, and one of the more well constructed aspects of the album. You can argue the talk-box solo is unnecessary, but Adam Jones is quirky that way, he'll throw things in just for the hell of it. I think what makes this song so memorable is that its lyrics are very vague, and you can apply them to yourself, just like with previous Tool songs on other albums. The band is quoted as to saying this is their \\"blues album\\" with a lot of heart felt lyrics, and personal reflection involved. You can tell that throughout the entire CD, except on Jambi, which is slightly ambiguous. You don't know who Maynard is talking to. He doesn't address it. And I think its that sense of vagueness that makes this such a great song in my opinion. Best on the album to me.<br /><br />The Wings duo is a toss up for me. The main reason its a toss up is because I feel the first part Wings for Marie Pt. 1 as a stand alone track, fails. It starts out good, but then develops into a jam session. And I am not a fan of that. However, you put it with 10,000 Days, and it makes sense and it fits. But take 10,000 Days, and it can stand alone. In fact, when you hear it live, you can't wait till 10,000 Days, because that's where the intensity lies. You can look at Wings Pt. 1 as merely a segue at times, because it doesn't seem to have that much character alone. But I judge them together, because just like Parabol/Parabola, they come together, and shouldn't be separated. Together, they are epic. Incredibly heart felt, very deep for a man who keeps himself rather closed off, but yet wears his heart on his sleeve so profoundly. Truth be told, Maynard sings to his mom and its hard to see why he loved the woman and pays so much homage to her. He disagreed with so much of her ideas, its amazingthat he misses her as much as he does. But that's beside the point. This two piece set here, brings chills down my spine when I hear it. And the live rendition has brought tears to many eyes because of its raw emotion. The first time I heard it live, the entire crowd was silent. No one yelling, no one shouting. Some people were crying. Music does that to us. Overall, The Wings duo is effective. I wouldn't recommend separating them though.<br /><br />The Pot is a bit of a dichotomy to me. On one hand, its so poppish you can't believe Tool wrote it. On the other hand, its so poppish you just have to love it. Its groovy and wicked. You can pop it on and sing to it and just scream your lungs out. It's a signature song now, and according to Billboard, their biggest hit to date, reaching #1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart. I know some people fell in love with the intro, the falsetto vocals that make you do a double take as you struggle to remember \\"yup, this is Tool\\" because it doesn't follow the typical structure we're used to on Aenima or Lateralus. It's vastly different. And I think that's why 10,000 Days as a whole doesn't feel like a Tool CD at times. But then, there are splashes throughout the Pot that remind you, \\"yes, I'm definitely listening to Tool\\" such as Danny Carey's drumming. Its groovy and its fun, and to me, after Jambi, its one of the best parts of this CD.<br /><br />The segue Lipan Conjuring is one of the worst segues to me. I enjoy some of the segues, but of course they are the part of the CD skipped the most. LC doesn't really do anything. It acts as a wetting of the pallet, but it still leaves little to be desired. There are some classic Tool segues, and this won't end up at the top. The ending, with a very harsh scream from MJK is the only saving grace to it, but you have to wait like 50 seconds to get to there, which just isn't worth it.<br /><br />Lost Keys is a very long intro into Rosetta Stoned. I love the intro, except when its done live. It doesn't come off as well when they drag it out 4 extra minutes (its only like 4 minutes, so an 8 minute intro to Rosetta Stoned is annoying). The voice overs are forgivable but unnecessary. As LK ends, it kicks into Rosetta Stoned, which some consider a rehashing of Third Eye, which it's not. It's nothing like Third Eye (from Aenima). It has a class all by itself. Don't be fooled, I'm not particularly fond of this song. I think that with Vicarious, its quite boring. However, there are some excellent moments in the song. \\"overwhelmed as one would be...\\" is an amazing line, sung with a lot of intensity. I think the rapid talking from Maynard is comical, but not very effective, especially live, this song comes out like a big mess when its performed live. I think the boys will ax it from future tours. I think what drags this song down to me, is its length first of all. I'm not saying I don't like instrumental, or that i'm all about lyrics, but it seems that the spacing in between it doesn't work. There's just a lot of forgettable space in the song, where you're ready to change it to the next song. I feel that the song lacks in the department, and it doesn't keep our attention very well. Its well crafted, but it needed something else. The spoken word is cool, but it gets old. And the lyrics are sub-par when you consider what Maynard can actually do. Singing wise, its great, on par with the rest of the record (but not as great as Lateralus) Overall, I feel this song is a bit lengthy, and slightly boring, but still very listenable and enjoyable for those with patience.<br /><br />Intension is one of those songs where you think its a segue, but its not. People will skip it, that's for sure. But their missing out on one of the best parts of the album. Intension is considered to be like Disposition (I think mainly b/c of the \\"tion\\" endings). Its roughly 7 or 8 minutes long, and there isn't much to it. But the sound, its so soothing, and it prepares you perfectly for the final song on the album, Right in Two. Intension takes you into the final stages, and really is a well constructed piece of music by Tool. There are three epic songs on this disc. The Wings duo, LK/Rosetta Stoned, and Intension/Right in Two. Wings 1, alone, doesn't work. Lost Keys alone, doesn't work. But Intension by itself...WORKS. It is effective as a song, and can stand alone. Its cool to hear it trail off into Right in Two, but its not necessary. It won't be a mainstay I'm sure, and its never been play fully live, but its one of Tool's more relaxing, and soothing songs. It goes right into the final song.<br /><br />Right in Two, bares close resemblance to what I said in regards to the APC lyrics. Its very straight forward. But it skews from the path that you'd think it would be. It starts out as being just like any other Tool song, and then cuts loose into a predetermined jam, that is so intense, and it builds and builds, until you personally are ready to burst through with the \\"Angels on the Sidelines\\" lyric and sing along for the finale. Its a great way to close the album, and ranks at the top of the album for me, because it has lasting power.<br /><br />Viginti Tres is pointless to me. Its just a sound. While I think that that 5 and a half minutes devoted to it could have been put to better use, the boys will do what they want. It's just a sound, and I don't care too much for it.<br /><br />So you may be confused. I end up giving props to only half the CD really, but still give it 5 stars. Well Tool's music is more thought provoking then some. It's still miles from what it could be. Tool's a gateway band, always will be. You listen to Tool, you start to find new music. Therefore, no album is less than a 5 star rating because it will open your mind to new things, and thats NEVER a bad thing. That said, this album is actually great. Though I don't care for Vicarious or Rosetta Stoned, doesn't mean that they are awful. Plus, its just my opinion on them, I've spoken to some people who are absolutely in love with both songs, They never grow tired of it. That's good. Some of us find something worth keeping in it and thats good.<br /><br />Personally, Jambi alone gets 5 stars. I think its one of the greatest Tool songs ever written, and The Pot is fantastic too. Right in Two, with Intension tagged on to it, is another classic Tool song. And the Wings duo will remain at the top of any Tool fans list because of its intensity. Overall, this album doesn't disappoint me, and its well worth waiting five years for. Slightly disappointing I'll admit, but compared to everything else, its okay to not wow us amazingly again. Its got stiff competition, and for a group that comes from an era that is nonexistent anymore (seriously, how many 90's rock bands are still around?), Tool maintains there grasp on music, and being genius musicians.t 4 extra minutes (its only like 4 minutes, so an 8 minute intro to Rosetta Stoned is annoying). The voice overs are forgivable but unnecessary. As LK ends, it kicks into Rosetta Stoned, which some consider a rehashing of Third Eye, which it's not. It's nothing like Third Eye (from Aenima).

Intension is considered to be like Disposition (I think mainly b/c of the \\"tion\\" endings). Its roughly 7 or 8 minutes long, and there isn't much to it. But the sound, its so soothing, and it prepares you perfectly for the final song on the album, Right in Two. Intension takes you into the final stages, and really is a well constructed piece of music by Tool. There are three epic songs on this disc. The Wings duo, LK/Rosetta Stoned, and Intension/Right in Two. Wings 1, alone, doesn't work. Lost Keys alone, doesn't work. But Intension by itself...WORKS. It is effective as a song, and can stand alone. Its cool to hear it trail off into Right in Two, but its not necessary. It won't be a mainstay I'm sure, and its never been play fully live, but its one of Tool's more relaxing, and soothing songs. It goes right into the final song.     Right in Two, bares close resemblance to what I said in regards to the APC lyrics. Its very straight forward. But it skews from the path that you'd think it would be. It starts out as being just like any other Tool song, and then cuts loose into a predetermined jam, that is so intense, and it builds and builds, until you personally are ready to burst through with the \\"Angels on the Sidelines\\" lyric and sing along for the finale. Its a great way to close the album, and ranks at the top of the album for me, because it has lasting power.     Viginti Tres is pointless to me. Its just a sound. While I think that that 5 and a half minutes devoted to it could have been put to better use, the boys will do what they want. It's just a sound, and I don't care too much for it.       So you may be confused. I end up giving props to only half the CD really, but still give it 5 stars. Well Tool's music is more thought provoking then some. It's still miles from what it could be. Tool's a gateway band, always will be. You listen to Tool, you start to find new music. Therefore, no album is less than a 5 star rating because it will open your mind to new things, and thats NEVER a bad thing. That said, this album is actually great. Though I don't care for Vicarious or Rosetta Stoned, doesn't mean that they are awful. Plus, its just my opinion on them, I've spoken to some people who are absolutely in love with both songs, They nevergrow tired of it. That's good. Some of us find something worth keeping in it and thats good.     Personally, Jambi alone gets 5 stars. I think its one of the greatest Tool songs ever written, and The Pot is fantastic too. Right in Two, with Intension tagged on to it, is another classic Tool song. And the Wings duo will remain at the top of any Tool fans list because of its intensity. Overall, this album doesn't disappoint me, and its well worth waiting five years for. Slightly disappointing I'll admit, but compared to everything else, its okay to not wow us amazingly again. Its got stiff competition, and for a group that comes from an era that is nonexistent anymore (seriously, how many 90's rock bands are still around?), Tool maintains there grasp on music, and being genius musicians.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the most enjoyable \\"Jane Eyre\\" I have seen. The dialogue is good and it is very well paced. There is a definite chemistry between the two principals (which make it a success) along with an excellent supporting cast. Jane and Rochester are attractive and appealing, despite the premise that they are both not physically good looking. Most versions of \\"Jane Eyre\\" work on some level,to me, this works on all levels.

0316018953|4.0|One of M.C.'s thinner efforts.  Flows well, and the usual suspects are the usual suspects, but lacks meat and full character realization.  Difficult to do when the audience knows the mainline people.  Worth a read, but not rich.
0786838655|5.0|I love buying books under the guise of purchasing them for my 9 year old son.  The excuse lets me read a lot of great \\"kid\\" books without looking quite as nutty as I am.      Riordan's book is a fun read.  I checked out a short encyclopedia of Greek mythology to go along with it, which made looking up all the gods, demi-gods, and monsters quick and easy.  I guess you could use Wikipedia for the same.    The plot moves along nicely and contains some decent suspense.  If you, young or old, like Harry Potter type books, then you will enjoy this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought Firefly on a whim from Amazon a few months ago, intrigued by all of the stellar reviews that it had gotten. I wasn't expecting much..having never been a fan of science fiction shows or westerns for that matter. However...this series completely blew me away. After just one episode I had to order Serenity so that I could watch it when I was done with the series (which I finished the next day). Amazing, amazing show. It's smart, touching, very well written and acted, hilarious, everything you could want from a TV show. It breaks my heart that it was cancelled so prematurely.    For a little show that was only on for half of a season, shown out of order and with almost no marketing - to have inspired this much passion from people...you know that this is something very special.
0670033375|1.0|A great and timely theme.  Unfortunately, supporting this theme with spurious, old, and disregarded data doesn't make the case.  The result is that anyone half-way sophisticated enough to be familiar with the issues and up-to-date information will be at least unimpressed.  The previous \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" was a good piece of work, at least from the purely materialist perspective, but this one will not make converts.

0061148512|5.0|I originally read The Bell Jar in an introductory English course at the University of Texas.  I remember staying up late at night reading this book, as it captivated me from the first sentence.  In class, we went over a brief background of Sylvia Plath's life and the personal, political, social, etc. environment in which the book was written.  I remember looking at pictures of Sylvia Plath in class, with her All-American good looks and obvious intelligence, then going home to read the dark thoughts and insecurities that she described in The Bell Jar.  I remember being perplexed by this book, as I could not understand why such a successful and beautiful, young lady would ever even think about comitting suicide.  I also coudn't understand why she was so \\"turned-off\\" by the world and every important person in her life (i.e. her mother, her father, Buddy Willard, etc.).  I mean, I loved this book from the beginning but I was left with many questions regarding Sylvia Plath, herself.    Well, I am now two years removed from college and I have gone through some tragedy of my own.  I was recently diagnosed with Generalized-Anxiety-Disorder (GAD) and had to get treatment for it.  I have since been \\"cured,\\" but in re-reading The Bell Jar I couldn't help but admire how Plath makes the decent of Esther Greenwood into borderline insanity seem rational, if not altogether normal.  I may also add that I had recently read The Catcher in the Rye and I got great joy out of paralleling Holden and Esther as I worked through the book.  In addition, I researched Sylvia's life more in depth and watched the movie SYLVIA, with Gwyneth Paltrow portraying Sylvia Plath.  This added background made all the difference in the world in regards to my experience with this book.  As if I hadn't already enjoyed the book so much more my second time reading it, I found the answer to my questions in the \\"Biographical Note\\" section of the book.  In it, Aurelia Plath, Sylvia's mom, describes Sylvia's intended message in the Bell Jar, as explained by Sylvia during a conversation with her mother shortly before her suicide:    \\" 'What I've done...is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalizing to add color...I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown...I've tried to picture my world and the people in it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar.'\\"  \\"The very title The Bell Jar should imply what Sylvia told me and that is what the astute reader should infer...\\"    Now, I know that Sylvia wasn't \\"turned-off\\" by the important people in her life so much as she was seeing them through the distorted lens of the bell jar.  Thus, she wasn't herself and other people's behavior seemed superficial and irrational to her when in reality it was her behavior that was irrational and to a certain extent superficial.      Despite the criticisms of this book, I would reccomend everyone to buy this book and read it with this last notion in mind.

1594489505|5.0|REVIEW    A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS by KHALED HOSSEINI    This is one of the most powerful and absorbing books that I have ever read. Set in Afghanistan (the author's birthplace) from the Soviet invasion, through Mujahideen and Taliban times to the post-Taliban reconstructions, seen through the eye of two Muslim women, I sometimes felt ill because of their heart-rending lives.         It is how Mariam and Laila, coming together in the most unlikely of circumstances, coped somehow with a series of horrendous situations. Certain passages made me almost afraid to turn the page! A must read.

B00005JPLW|5.0|I've seen this movie three times in the theater and I've been waiting to pre-order it.  If you accept that this movie is based on a graphic novel and that it's main purpose is to provide eye candy (not historical accuracy), then you will love it.  There is no real plot or dialog, but that isn't the purpose of this movie.  This is just pure eye candy.  Watch it and be awed by the cinematography.
B0000844I8|3.0|If you've ever seen \\"Stargate SG-1\\" or its spinoffs, then you're already familiar with the idea of a stargate -- a big stone ring that opens a wormhole to other planets.<br /><br />But the concept started with \\"Stargate,\\" the movie that first spawned the ideas that were later fleshed out into an epic TV show. And taken on its own merits, \\"Stargate\\" is a pretty entertaining blockbuster with some big flaws. It uncomfortably straddles the fence between \\"shoot-em-up bombs'n'action\\" and \\"mythology sci-fi,\\" but provides a solid villain, some sketchy writing, and the foundation for a hit TV show. Well, it's definitely far better than your average sci-fi blockbuster.<br /><br />Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has just lost his job due to his wacked-out, History Channel-style theories about ancient Egypt. Immediately afterwards, a mysterious old lady invites him to become involved in a secret Air Force project, which somehow involves examining some obscure hieroglyphs. When Daniel figures out what the signs are, the Air Force reluctantly shows him what he's working towards -- a massive stone ring found in Giza decades ago. When they apply his work to the computer controlling the stargate, the Air Force is able to open a wormhole to a distant galaxy.<br /><br />A recon team is sent through as soon as possible,  led by the grieving Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russell) and including Daniel so he can (theoretically) get them back to Earth. This new world is a desert planet, inhabited by a race of primitive human slaves who practically worship the strangers. But things turn deadly when a pyramid ship descends on the desert, and a malevolent \\"god\\" decides to obliterate Earth -- using a nuclear bomb O'Neil brought along.<br /><br />\\"Stargate\\" is not a terribly complicated story, especially compared to its spinoff material. It has a pretty straightforward action plot -- nerdy scientist opens gateway to distant planet, good guys go to distant planet, bad guy shows up and makes trouble, good guys attack bad guy with the help of plucky natives, one side wins. This movie admittedly doesn't add much to the typical formula, but it does dress it up with gilded robes, giant stone statues, glittering starships and sandswept deserts.<br /><br />In fact, spectacle is what \\"Stargate\\" excels at -- it has big armies of invading, big ships, big pyramids, and big battles with Ra's warriors. When it comes to gun battles and explosions, Roland Emmerich does a pretty decent job. However, he gets mesmerized by the gilded interior of Ra's starship and the androgynous alien \\"god\\" slinking around in elaborate robes. The middle part of the movie is very slow-moving, and it stumbles somewhat at reconciling the guns-and-bombs action movie with the glittering mythological bent of the story.<br /><br />The character development is a also rather clumsy, particularly when Emmerich strains to deal with serious topics like guilt and the death of a child (\\"I don't want to die. Your men don't want to die. These people don't want to die. It's a shame you're in such a hurry to\\"). Daniel's romance with a chief's daughter is rather charming, though, and the interactions with the people of Abydos are more interesting because nobody speaks the same language.<br /><br />While Daniel is little more than the \\"standard nerd\\" here, Spader pretty much steals the show as the mild-mannered nerd who finds himself on the adventure of a lifetime. And the geek gets the alien princess, not the military grunts -- a nice change from the typical trope. Russell is stuck with a rather stiff, humourless military man, although he loosens up in the last lap and gets to show some wit and cleverness. And Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital and Erick Avari all get kudos for making the lovable, deep characters come alive without a word of English.<br /><br />\\"Stargate\\" relies on spectacle and slam-bang action scenes to keep the audience amused, despite a rather thin plot and some equally thin character development. If nothing else, it was the springboard for one of the best sci-fi TV shows in existence.sci-fi TV shows in existence.

I'm a slow reader and I read it in short intervals over a few days. I found my self stopping to try the suggestions.  It was great!  I purchased the lowest price recommended tripod(Manfrotto 3021BPRO rather than 3011) and I love it!  Although it is laced with rather silly humor, I found myself laughing every time.  A great read and much more useful than any of the camera specific books I've read.

0743496728|5.0|Great book!  Although fiction, this is a very real topic that has happened in real life too often.  It felt like an inside look and gave me perspective to better empathize with real victims of an incident such as a school shooting.  Through the character of Lacy, I also felt much sorrow for parents of children who have gone astray and committed a horrific crime.  This is one of Picoult's best stories, although I do have to say I wasn;t 100% satisfied with the ending.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|THE BROTHERS GRIM (2005) is a project directed by Terry Gilliam, who  has a  world class reputation to it. This work is not everyone's cup  of tea, as was the case too for VAN HELSING, for example. However,  worldwide, niche audiences are sufficient to make specialized movies  such as this one viable and successul. With  Peter Stormare,  Matt  Damon  Heath Ledger, as well as Lena Headey, this is chiefly a  British cast requiring Damon to emulate the accent from across the  pond.    Typically, magic stories such as this one, in this case touching  upon the abduction of children, (similar to Charles Dicken's Oliver  Twist, for example) are for those below 12. However, there is a spin  on the movie and enough special effects to make it worthwhile for  other audiences to perhaps agreeing in being taken on an imaginary  rollercoaster for 90 mins, in a ghoulish, other dimension of  reality. For some, an entirely believable nightmare.    Although not entirely new as a script, flawless works need to be  recognized and applauded, by not taking for granted all the acting  skill, special effects, audio that is shown here.    The film is superb in the visual sequences, effects, completely  realistic scenes (especially those involving weather, with horses, a  platoon of French soldiers, etc), as well as in the audio (classical  music and effects.)    A ferocious lion is shown that will knock the audience's socks off,  as well as the noisy  crows and ravens, It is convincing in  reminding viewers of the claustrophobia felt when in a dense forest  packed with tall trees, in this case, the location of an ancient  burial ground.    The story unfolds at a quick pace, in a logical, credible manner,  situated at the turn of the 19th century, in Germany. The strong  Medieval magical tales, myths, legends as told by the characters, of  a princess waiting for an eventual rescue at her royal chambers in a  magical or enchanted forest commands the audience's imagination.    The irony is notlost on the protagonists, who are magicians of some  sorts, conmen, experts in laying out a tale on naive, uneducated,  simpleton populations so they fork over protection money to Damon  and Ledger. They go through dire straigts when they are caught, and  made to solve a real-life crisis of child abductions in a village.    The \\"other dimension\\" depicted is made very dream-like and credible,  by formal references to spell books, witchcraft,  symbols of the  occult, ghoulish dressed characters, dark forests, a full moon,  moving trees, shape shifting animals into humans, or a mummified  Queen morphing into a youthful girl, or what about the toad that  acts as a compass of sorts.    The action scenes are thoroughly realistic, featuring man to man  combats and stunts, except for 1 flaw, which was a \\"gingerbread man\\"  made up of mud, that was obviously digital, artificial.    This DVD deserves a clear 4 stars from its excellence. But in terms  of a grown up audience, a 3 is more appropriate.

Scott delivers a towering rendition of the profane, colorful, contradictory Patton, by turns making us admire, revile, and pity this man, who was driven by a profound sense of pre-destination.

B000CNESU8|5.0|Sidney Lumet's devastating, disturbing satire of the modern broadcast age (written by Paddy Chayefsky) still has a lot to say thirty years after release. Beyond portraying a business that bypasses quality in single-minded pursuit of the dollar, television serves as metaphor for a society mired in sensationalism and greed. Dunaway is commanding in a caffeinated performance as ruthless Diana, Holden unusually affecting as a washed-up veteran of TV's glory days, and Finch a revelation as the unbalanced Beale, winning a posthumous Oscar for his work.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I enjoyed this version of Jane Eyre the most compared to the 1996 and 1997 versions. The Mr. Rochester is perfect. Although the actress who played Jane Eyre wasn't very believable I expected her to have a stronger presence. This movie pretty much met my expectations.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|Penned by a young Stallone, the script for \\"Rocky\\" was sold with the proviso that its writer, who was a nobody himself in 1976, would star in the low-budget film. Stallone got his wish, and like Rocky, made good on the unlikely opportunity to clinch his fame. Although the feel-good, come-from-behind story has been done to death, Avildsen's mix of low-life street drama, heart-tugging romance (with Talia Shire as Rocky's faithful girl), and bruising, in-the-ring melodramatics hammer home the uplifting message of hope like few films ever have. The gritty camerawork, location shots in urban Philly, and Rocky's intense training scenes with irritable, curmudgeonly Meredith (who's terrific) work beautifully. Tuck in and take a shot at \\"Rocky.\\"

B000R8YC18|5.0|Scorsese's dark vision of human alienation in an urban wasteland captures the seaminess of pre-Giuliani Manhattan, and DeNiro's career-making performance as Bickle is haunting, recalling those real-life outcasts who have used violent crime to tell an oblivious world: \\"I was here!\\". Stunningly directed and acted, this picture is every bit as disturbing now as when released. Brilliant, but not for the faint of heart.

B00005R2IS|5.0|George Miller's first entry in the three part series helped boost Gibson to stardom, and showed Hollywood a thing or two about making an explosive action flick on a shoestring budget. The bleak, desolate near-future is intriguingly rendered: the world looks like a junk shop in a desert.

0517543052|5.0|During the 1960's, the younger generation of that time used acid as a way to discover and then pursue a deeper relationship with God. While times have changed, the message Baba Ram Dass puts forth in his book is timeless. Be Here Now came into my life about three years ago and reading it simply felt like it was the next step I needed to take in my own journey. After studying yoga for many years, Be Here Now helped strengthen my awareness with the mental and spiritual aspects of yoga. I have never had the chance to meet Ram Dass in person, but I once saw him give a lecture when he was a guest on Lilias Folan's PBS series and found him to be one of the most humble teachers of our time. He has made his experience of India with the teachings of Buddhism and yogic philosophy his own. And with his humility and guidance one can make the experience of Being Here Now their own.

B000I0QKDS|4.0|When I was a kid, some older musician friends turned me onto this record, and  the musical world opened up a little more for me. Even as a young whelp, I could recognize that Jeff Beck was doing something different with the guitar, making him stand out far above the masses of other guitar players. The fact that he had gathered other greats such as Rod Stewart and Ron Wood only served to make the music that much greater. Fans of classic rock will also want to note this album also features appearances by such illuminaries as Keith Moon, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Nicky Hopkins and Aynsley Dunbar.<br /><br />All that said, there are a few misfires here (mostly in the bonus tracks.) There is a tad too much emphasis on blues rock, understandable for the time, but a bit overdone by modern standards. Most of the alternate takes are decent enough, but not quite as good as the original selections. However, the bonus tracks do include a couple oddities that are fun in \\"Tallyman\\" and \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining.\\"<br /><br />But when the group is hitting on all cylinders, the music they make is great. Particular highlights are their version of \\"Shapes of Things\\" and \\"Greensleeves,\\" along with \\"Beck's Bolero\\" and \\"Rock My Plimsoul\\" and the awesome blues rocker \\"I Ain't Superstitious.\\" The combination of Beck's guitar and Stewart's voice is terrific and very memorable. All in all, a very worthwhile record.

That said, I'm still not entirely convinced that something like the Judas Strain could actually exist, at least not in the way it exists in the book.<br /><br />On the other hand, what really makes the novel interesting is that while this plot is more-or-less wrapped up at novel's end, threads involving the Guild and some of the characters are far from over, and I look forward to seeing how Rollins deals with those threads. (So as not to provide unwanted spoilers, I'll post my comments on those loose ends in the Comments thread beneath this post.)<br /><br />My only real complaint, though, is that some of the scenes seemed, in a couple of places, to be completely gratuitous, and not for the faint of heart. But, if you like action thrillers, and can stomach the occasional blood-and-gore scene, this book will be right up your alley.<br /><br />[One last note: if you haven't read \\"Kowalski's in Love,\\" a Sigma Force short story included in the anthology [[ASIN:0778322998 Thriller]], do. Kowalski appears in The Judas Strain, and a lot of his comments won't make sense unless you've read the story. Keep in mind that Kowalski is present in The Judas Strain in large part, but by no means entirely, to provide comic relief.]

They are probally hard to find now due to kind folks buying them all up & then reselling- SCALPING them on places like Amazon & Ebay.  The DVD is a \\"CMT pick\\" & is a limited edition.  This is not the same dvd that comes with the Japanese Import but caution there too- it only plays in region 3 & wont play in region 1 the USA.
0440241030|1.0|I purchased this book for my 93 years old mother.  When she received the book it was not a large print book which is what I had ordered.  She lives in Illinois and I live in California so I was unable to package up the book and take it to the post office. She is unable to do that.  Therefore, this was a most unsatisfactory order.

B000784WMW|3.0|If you had to do a book report on Jane Eyre but didn't want to read it, this is the movie to see. Very acurate comparison with the book, but a little lacking in imagination as far as art direction goes. The acting is fair.  Die-hard Jane Eyre fans would love this movie. My biggest complaint with it is the fact that, as it is a television series, there is a break every 20 minutes where the credits are given and the chapter displayed which makes it even longer. If you are looking for good cinematography, script and acting, my favorite is the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre version. It doesn't follow the book as closely, but it is a beuatifully done film.
B000NA2348|4.0|young americans as an album is great - my reason for this review is to find out if i'm just hearing things or if there are a couple mistakes on the standard cd of this album (not the 5.1 mix)    at 3:45 in the song young americans, the background singers seem to drop completely out of the mix for a full second in the right speaker. also, maybe 5 to 10 seconds or so before this, there is a click that kind of sounds like skip in the cd but its not - these aren't huge things but for an audiophile, they're distracting at the least, esp. with headphones - can anyone else verify that this is on all of the copies of the special edition album? its not just mine, right?

0061122416|5.0|I ordered this book on a whim because I liked the name.  I am generally a fantasy or crime novel reader.  This book was neither of these things.  It was however, an artfully penned journey through a young man's life.  Coelho writes so vividly that you are enraptured by the simplest of events in the book.  It is as though you have crawled into the main character's heart and are watching the story from within.  As he learns, you learn. As he grows, you grow.    I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys clear, beautiful literature.  His story is a simple tale written with a magnificent spark of wonder laced with hope that allows the reader to revisit their own dreams and purpose. What a pleasure it was to read.
1416914285|1.0|This book had a lot of promise.  Some of the banter between the characters was clever and witty.  But what this book lacked was logic and intelligence.  The characters just acted dumb!  Fr'instance:  A friend is taken by vampires, so the hero and heroine, ALONE, go to rescue him, instead of asking assistance from friends.    Two people (one of whom is ignorant of vampires and knows nothing about fighting) against a whole nest of vampires???  The Omnipotent Authorial Hand engineers their escape *big surprise*.    Then they decide to find the Mortal Cup to rescue Clary's mother.  But what exactly will they do once they have the cup?  How will they use it to get her back?   There is no plan, not even a discussion of possibilities.   They just lurch from one event to another allowing the author to plunk them into one silly situation after another.    Then there is the problematic attraction between the hero and  heroine.   I kept wondering why they didn't act on it.  And when they finally did (a passionate kiss), it really didn't go anywhere.   And, at the end, you find out why.   In other words,  the distance between them was completely artificial so that a crucial plot element wouldn't  creep people out.   Ugh.  Serious Ugh.    And, then at the end, the Absolute Worst Part of the book:  the good guys have a chance to kill the bad guy, BUT. DO.  NOT.   A seriously evil man is allowed to escape because the main characters are wimps, complete absolute pathetic weenies.    Obviously, the authorial hand stopped the killing so there could be a sequel and another and another.   But they won't be read by me.
B00005MP58|5.0|I read the book and no one has filmed the book correctly till this film. The way it is expressed and not changed to our time period is what makes it so wonerful.

B000B6CODO|5.0|This movie was a fresh, original and entertaining show, you never know what will happen next!

B00000G3PA|5.0|Armageddon is one of my top ten movies of all time.  Out of my 750 DVD Collection I own, I often find myself reaching right past movies I haven't even watched yet so I can sit back and watch Armageddon once more.    It takes a lot to get anyone to watch a movie several times over and over, especially with the enourmous number of movies out there to chose from, but the wit and storyline just really flows together and the one liners are hilarious.      One of my all time favorite lines came from this movie, from the character \\"Rockhound\\" played by Steve Buscemi:  \\"You know we're sitting on four million pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon and a thing that has 270,000 moving parts built by the lowest bidder. Makes you feel good, doesn't it?\\"    The roster of all-star cast members is amazing and in my opinion, they all showed why they are all-stars, it was a great performance from everyone.    Everyone complains that the movie isn't realistic? It's a sci-fi movie for goodness sakes.  If your standard for a good movie is that is has to be feasible then you might as well completely wipe out more than a few entire categories of movies altogether.      Like I said in the title of this review, if I wanted realism and feasibility I would just go about my life, I go to the movies to get away from realism.

B00001U0DP|5.0|I went to the movies alone and this was the only movie playing at the time I arrived so I bought a ticket and went in.  It was in english subtitles and the first 5 minutes was slow because they developed the situation.  I truly started to get up and leave.  Then the main character met the woman of his dreams in a very unusual manner (unusual is a word you can use throughout the movie) and everything after riveted me to my seat!  This movie will pierce your heart with ALL the emotions!  YOU WILL laugh out loud, smile, cry, be filled with a sense of foreboding, and at the end sadness and joy simultaneously.  You will CHEER for fatherhood and want to be the best father and husband you can!  If we had in our own lives what this family had in theirs, the world would truly be a great place to live!!! The acting is fabulous, the story is WOW!  I've seen it about 7 or 8 times and will watch it again!  I must stop because I am sure you don't want a 1000 page discertation!  You will ENJOY this EVENT!

B000N4SHOE|1.0|First Question - Was Beatrix Potter really a vacuous, loopy, self-loathing retard who saw fairies and bunnies all day long?<br /><br />Second Question - Which brilliant mind decided that equally ridiculous actress Renee Zellweger should step into the actors' seat for this trainwreck of a film?<br /><br />Third Question - How did a film so obviously idiotic and ill thought-out possibly garner enough funding to complete production?<br /><br />If you knew the answers to that, I'd be your friend.<br /><br />The truth is - this is terrible. I'm not a fan or hater of Renee Zellweger, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that she is woefully miscast in a horribly written role. Now heres the thing, we have the story of childrens' author Beatrix Potter - and the film paints her in this saintly glow (with ethereal light pouring in on her face every now and then - seriously!), and completely misses the point that she was probably a normal woman who just liked to draw and write. I can understand the need to create melodrama for the sake of it, but this really took things too far.<br /><br />The problems are two-fold - the writers realized that the story of Potter as a person wasn't terribly interesting and milked the `its-so-hard-to-be-a-woman-in-this-era' card for all it was worth. This becomes tedious after a point. Add to that the magical visions she has, and the books metaphorically drawing themselves. They wasted at least twenty good minutes on this convoluted garbage, and if I was a fifteen year old ballerina, I'd probably be weeping during these scenes, but I'm not.<br /><br />What I do realize though, is how limited an actress Renee actually is. If you hated her in `Jerry Maguire' and every other film she has been in, here is a chance to see her debase herself to extents even she probably did not think possible! In fact, if you watch closely, all she seems to be doing is either grinning or wallowing in self pity. The scenes where she is `lost in her own world' should be seen to be believed.<br /><br />The primary concern I have with this, is that Renee comes across as severely drugged and cerebrally disabled during the course of this film. There is no other term for it. As for the Ewan McGregor angle, this is one actor who has been consistently wasted since the last episode of the `Star Wars' franchise, and watching him opposite Zellweger here is painful indeed, as there is obviously no chemistry on any level.<br /><br />Heres the bottom line - there is obviously an audience for this trash. Granted, I'm not it, but if you're a male or female with reasonable intelligence above the age of 25, I implore you - avoid this like the plague. This falls into the `movies so bad, they're not even bad enough to be called camp' category, and it has terrible screenwriting, and even worse performances from all concerned. When it got over, I was like, that's it? THIS was what Potter was all about? Granted, drawing bunnies all day didn't seem like the most trying thing around, but still, if her life was really this boring, I can only imagine how life must have been like during that era.<br /><br />Overly distraught, and evenly grotesque, \\"Miss Potter\\" is an abomination you should avoid.<br /><br />Watch this only to discover the uselessness that is Renee Zellweger, if you must.<br /><br />One Star - and thats for the books the original author wrote.rimary concern I have with this, is that Renee comes across as severely drugged and cerebrally disabled during the course of this film.

B000PFUAO6|3.0|I have been a Dream Theater fan for 11 years and this album was mostly a disappointment.  I pretty much agree with \\"James Hare's\\" review, except I couldn't care less about what lyrics they write (DT fans listen to DT to hear Petrucci and Portnoy and Myung do things that none of us can do, not to hear Labrie sing mediocre lyrics).    There are a few bright spots on this album (Forsaken and Constant Motion are pretty cool) but for the most part, this album just doesn't have it's own character like past DT albums.  Octavarium also struggled to come into it's own unique identity.      If you are buying your first Dream Theater album I recommend in the following order:  Scenes from a Memory (1999)  Falling into Infinity (1997)  Train of Thought (2003)  Images and Words (1992)  Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002)
1594489505|5.0|I just finished this book and I am truly thankful that I read it.  It was powerful, moving, enlightening, thought-provoking, heart-wrenching to name a few emotions that really do not even scratch the surface.  I needed to read this book, needed to be educated on what lives are like in other countries outside of the USA.  There were times, I laughed, I cried, felt hurt and angry and even applauded.  And I appreciate it also because living in a country where \\"Paris Hilton is sent to jail\\" or \\"Lindsey Lohan is going to Rehab\\" is the hightlight of the six o'clock news, I needed something like this novel to bring what's real and important to the forefront.  This is a true depiction into the everyday lives of these women of Afghanistan who are ill-treated and abused just becasue it's allowed.  I highly recommend this book and hope you will read and appreciate it and it's author as I do.
B00000F5KH|5.0|Central Station is a wonderful and emotional film.  An aging teacher, Dora, now works in the bustling Central Station of Brazil.  She writes letters for those who can't and for those who just wish to connect with someone, regardless of the message.  She takes down a message from a young boy Joshue, and his mother;  the mother wishes to send a letter to locate the boy's father.<br /><br />There is an accident outside the Central Station, and Joshue's mother is killed.  And now, without compassion or concern for the orphaned Joshue,  she takes him in and trades him for a TV to unscrupulous adoptive agency that kills the children and sells their organs.  Dora's friend, thankfully with scruples, intervens and demands that the boy be retrieved from that adoptive agency.  Together, they undertake a long journey on the bus to find his father.<br /><br />It may be somewhat predictible that a friendship occurs between an old lady and a young boy, but the movie focuses on the lines inbetween that friendship.  Fernanda Montenegro portrays Dora beautifully, caught between her world of coldness and the intimacy of friendship.  It takes a while to get there, and we see her and the boy transform.<br /><br />The DVD has audio commentary by Director Walter Salles and actress Fernanda.  The talk of how many of the real scenes were used, real actors or real workers in the Central Station.  The heat was over 100 degrees, 3 cranes were used for filming, etc., etc.  Subtitles are clear, cinematography is great, etc....Rizzo

0151012768|5.0|(4.5 stars) One of the most delightful and original satires I've read in ages, this debut novel pokes fun at every aspect of British society, from government spin-meisters and crass politicians to marriages of convenience, TV interview programs, consumerism, and the belief that many of the world's problems would be solved if only other people were \\"more like us.\\"  This satire is particularly refreshing, however, since the author writes it with a smile on his face, preferring to prick balloons with his witty needling, rather than wield a rapier in a slashing attack.<br /><br />The absurdity begins on the first page, when mild-mannered and unimaginative Dr. Alfred Jones, a fisheries specialist, receives a letter asking for his participation in a project to introduce Scottish salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the wadis of the Yemen during the yearly rains.  Alfred finds the whole idea ludicrous and ignores the letter, until the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and eventually the prime minister weigh in.  The PM's office favors this effort for its \\"environmental message,\\" the new links it will forge to a Middle Eastern country, and not incidentally, the huge, positive news story that may push stories of Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia off the front page.<br /><br />Through letters, e-mails, memos, diary entries, newspaper articles, records of the House of Commons, interviews, and even intercepted al-Qaeda e-mail traffic, the story of Alfred's efforts to create a suitable environment for salmon in the mountains of western Yemen unfolds.  Gradually, Alfred becomes intrigued with the research possibilities of the project, and his contact with His Excellency Sheikh Muhammad ibn Zaidi bani Tihama, an avid salmon-fisherman who lives part of the year on a Scottish estate, broadens his vision and stimulates his imagination.<br /><br />Within the framework that includes the salmon project, Alfred's love life (or lack of love life, since his wife lives in Geneva), and the sheikh's broad vision of a more peaceful world achieved through fishing, the author pokes fun at modern life--government officials who take credit for all Alfred's work, foreign policy which reflects the belief that the Middle Eastern poor hate the British because they do not have TV and material benefits, and even a communications expert who proposes a \\"Voice of Britain\\" TV channel with a quiz show in which poor Iraqi contestants can win dishwashers.  Not even the British army's \\"Bereavement Management Center\\" escapes the author's sharp eye.<br /><br />As Alfred accepts the sheikh's \\"belief in belief,\\" he grows emotionally, and when the prime minister insists on going to the Yemen for the first release of ten thousand young salmon into the wadi, the scene is set for a grand finale.  Filled with timely observations, an entertaining cast of characters, and a unique and well-developed story line (though the conclusion is a bit weak), this novel breaks new ground.  There are not many satires that can be called \\"charming,\\" and there may be even fewer novels about salmon fishing that can completely captivate those of us who have never climbed into a set of waders. n Mary Whippleof a more peaceful world achieved through fishing, the author pokes fun at modern life--government officials who take credit for all Alfred's work, foreign policy which reflects the belief that the Middle Eastern poor hate the British because they do not have TV and material benefits, and even a communications expert who proposes a \\"Voice of Britain\\" TV channel with a quiz show in which poor Iraqi contestants can win dishwashers.

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|In my opinion a truly great movie, if you are familiar with 1984 and like this genre ! V for Vendetta lives the modern Distopia and adds a lot of style. You can really feel the Screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers.  The Two Disc Special Edition is okay, but I have seen better ones, for example with a more packed Bonus Disc, a Booklet or a Digipak or at least an Slipon-Case. But anyhow, for a price around ten Dollars it is really worth a buy :)

B00000IMTG|4.0|I have been a Rainbow fan ever since I can remember. I was 10 years old when this LP came out and listened to it over and over and over throughout the years. There is no question that the Dio era is the BEST Rainbow era by far. If you want to simply listen to a great live album and listen to Dio, Powell and Blackmore do their stuff, then this is a great listen. However, there are a couple of disappointments with this.<br /><br />First! There is not 1 song from their BEST (or even one of the best albums ever for that matter), that being \\"Rising\\", on this live effort. Sure you get the short \\"blurb\\" of Starstruck during the Man on the Silver Mountain medley, but that only lasts about 20 seconds.<br /><br />Secondly! Catch the Rainbow is a great ballad but it is WAY too long and took a complete side of an LP when originally released. It also had some long silent moments. I was willing to get by this but then Mistreated was also a complete \\"side-stealer\\". That being said, those 2 took too much time and should've left room for songs like \\"Tarot Woman, Stargazer, the complete Starstruck or even Light in the Black\\", songs that are certainly worthy of playing live.<br /><br />The live versions of Kill The King and Still I'm Sad are the best tracks.<br /><br />I'm still giving this 4 stars simply because it's the classic lineup and it sounds good.

B000PFUAO6|4.0|For those Dream Theater fans who don't like this album, I ask you to stop and think for a second.  If you had never heard Images and Words, Awake, SFAM, or (Insert your favorite DT album), would your review of this album be different?  I think for most of us, the answer would be yes.  I've been guilty of allowing myself to be spoiled by past albums of DT and other bands, but when I open my mind to this album, in and of itself, I have to say that it is a great album as well.  If this was the first Dream Theater album I had ever heard, complaints would be minimal.  I own all of them, and every single album stands alone as a great compilation of music.  Musicianship and song structures of this stature are rare in the world of rock music today.  I say enjoy it while we can.  Dream Theater won't be around forever.  For those who would be buying a Dream Theater album for the first time with Systematic Chaos, you won't be disappointed, unless you aren't a fan of complex music.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|\\"Shooter\\" is the grotesque adaptation of Stephen Hunter's excellent novel \\"Point of Impact\\" to the paranoid delusions of Antoine Fuqua and the producers.  Fuqua has taken Hunter's perennial Bob Lee Swager from his traditional values, Vietnam Marine scout/sniper background, and rural Missouri/Arkansas heritage and transposed him into a shallow and unbelievable GWOT veteran betrayed by international butchers and various old fat white men stereotypes.  Wahlberg is entirely unbelievable as a principled Marine Scout/Sniper veteran and the other characters suffer from miscasting and horrible development in the screenplay.  Fuqua's GWOT misrepresentation as an unequal conflict between \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots\\" is nothing more or less than Michael Moore redux.  Technically, a movie centered around precision long range shooting should provide a treasure trove of interesting detail, as Hunter does in \\"Point of Impact\\".  Fuqua, however, concentrates on demonstrating firearm and ballistic ignorance, favoring big guns and ludicrous details and tactics.  Continuity is on vacation here, with close ups of muzzles of one rifle flashing to entirely different rifles being actually fired.  The real tragedy here is that in Hunter's \\"Point of Impact\\" Fuqua had a clear and detailed blueprint for an excellent movie.  Instead Fuqua and his producers made a hollow travesty of the original story.  The most that can be said is that \\"Shooter\\" serves as a complete and detailed bad example.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater's seventh album brings it to the table, dishes it out, and cleans up afterwards. A great album that, while only containing seven tracks, crosses the entire spectrum from the fast and heavy \\"This Dying Soul\\" to the calm and methodical \\"Vacant\\", easily more variation that many other bands out there can fit into albums with twice as many tracks.    Train of Thought has something for everyone, and for fans of Dream Theater, new and old, it certainly doesn't disappoint. And the more you listen to it, the more you grow to like it. Definitely a recommended buy, period.
B00005AG7K|2.0|I had seen this many years ago so I knew what to expect - if you don't know, don't expect something like \\"A Hard Days Night\\".  This is a very eccentric sales pitch for their new album at the time \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\".  The credits list Ringo as the director of photography, and maybe it's true - but he's a better drummer and human being than either a director or photographer.  Yet, there is much to appreciate in the historical content, and plenty to put a smile on the face of a fan.  I was disappointed in the video quality, it was apparently taken from a well used and faded film.  Plenty of scratches are visible, the colors are very faded, and scenes with the Beatles in white tuxes are terribly washed out.  HOWEVER, if you already have everything else of theirs, you may yet enjoy some of this video. If nothing else, see where the band \\"Death Cab for Cutie\\" got their name.
B000FBGBPC|1.0|The band is excellent. They are good musicians and play tightly together.  The problem is the lyrics are awful.  This is nothing less than nightmares set to music.  If you have these same thoughts running through your head, seek some professional psychiatric help.  Absolutely not recommended for young listeners.  Parents you are warned.  No wonder the record industry is on the ropes.
0743496728|2.0|I have read the majority of Jodi Picoult's novels and have loved most of them.  This book, however, was extremely disappointing.  I feel as if Jodi has narrowed her audience to middle school teenagers, and therefore leaving out the adult audiences who have treasured some of her other novels such as \\"The Pact\\".  This novel had numerous pop culture references such as...\\"She pulled a Hillary Duff on me\\"...and \\"they were the Brangelina of Sterling High.\\"  Unnecessary silliness.  In a few years, people will say...Brangelina...who? The ending was unrealistic and was not a twist at all...it was evident throughout the whole novel.
B00020HEL6|5.0|To start, I haven't bought or wasted much time in the past 30 years listening to anything trying to pass for music.    I read all 160 reviews, to be sure I made it very clear what her album means to me. And why I would bother with adding a review that's clearly in the majority.    I found out about Renee's singing thru her TV show as others did.    So I don't waste anyones time with repeating what's been repeated many times in the past 160 reviews, I'll leave out her age. It has no relevance to her sound.    I won't compare her to anyone else...Not to say another more mature singer  hasn't emulated Renee note for note to her disadvantage because Renee did it first and better.    I've tried, but at a total loss to get hold of her other two albums 'Unleashed' & 'Stone Country'. Much as I like her singing, I'm not putting out $80.00 for a 4 track album by anyone. But If I were to spend that much on music, her singing would be the deciding factor.    With most of the 160 reviews, they focus on the fact the album is bluesy/jazz.. and her age, and how this relates to how she sounds. I wouldn't know bluesy jazz if it bit me. But I do know when I like something, and my only gripe about Renee, is that I only have 14 songs by her to play over and over aqain. Her new album Skylark is due out in two days, reported by several web sites. And for this reason, I add my positive review to this album. I want more albums by Renee to listen to. One album just doesn't play that long. I figure the more that know  about her, the more incentive she has to make more albums. And increase my odds of more albums by her.    I see with Renee's album, the music and her renditions. It's all about her sound and how it sounds like her smiling with each song. You can hear how she enjoys singing. And something else I've found, playing her album over & over again also brings on new discoveries each time. The same songs are never the same. That's why I can't get enough of her singing.    My favorite was& still is Midnight at the oasis.. But it's having a hard time remaining at the top of my list. She sings duets that change every time I hear them, and inch them closer to the top of the list.    I really shouldn't mention a favorite, as I've given all 14 songs in my Itunes list 5 stars, so that when I play my favorites, hers are at the top.    Oasis just has such an odd story line to it.    My recommendation would be, if you like music, Renee is the one to watch. If you like the genre of music she's now into, you wouldn't want to be caught not knowing who Renee Olstead is.    Then you have her invitation to sing for the president. I predict she'll sing for many more presidents.    I was prompted to read all 160 reviews to see just why this album only rated a 4 1/4 stars. It seems there were 3 Trolls that wasted every ones time with a review from them. And several that just didn't feel like 5 was deserved. None lower than 3 except the trolls. And even one of them couldn't give her less than a 3. I'd say that speaks more than most of the other 155+ reviews. A troll that couldn't bring himself to bash her singing worse than a 3.    Had to be trolls. 155+ were in complete opposition. Remove the troll opinions and you have a solid 4 3/4. Maybe more depending on the star graphics available.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I could go on for pages about this album but in a nutshell:  This is not an easy album to listen to at first.  It's noisy (for lack of a better word) and painful.  But as with all the best music, the tracks start to take shape with repeated listenings.  If the album tanks, it's because Clive Davis was most concerned with being right and he has sabotaged it every step of the way.    The given coming into this album is that Clarkson is one of the greatest female singers to come to the forefront in the last 25 years, maybe the greatest.  There is nothing she can't do.  Yet she avoids showing off and just sings from her heart on every track.  Is it a perfect album?  Not at all.  Is it the work of a great artist?  Absolutely.

B00005JKO3|5.0|This film is based on the life of a legendary Spanish hero, and set during the troubled times of the 11th century. Spain was then a jig-saw puzzle of Christian and Moorish kingdoms, fighting each other, and unaware of the threat of the invasion being planned by the Almoravids of Africa. Then, as this became imminent, a man rose and called upon the different peoples to fight the enemy together - not as Christian or Moors, but as Spanish. And this one man led the Spanish to union and to victory.  Thus, it is a story wrought of high-minded politics and deadly battles; but also of striving for peace, and of undying loyalty to one's country and king. And as a golden thread, runs through it a noble love, that neither time, nor distance, nor death itself will ever end.  The adjective \\"epic\\" has been applied to too many films, and there is no point in using it here; it would not convey the right meaning. I will rather say that this film is heroic. For it is about a hero: a man who has dignity without pride; who is magnanimous and pious (which we see almost nowhere nowadays), and who has \\"vision to be just, and courage to be merciful\\".   Obviously, a good story and main character are not enough to secure the film itself will be good; but \\"El Cid\\" is technically considered a masterful production. The performances of the actors are all excellent; the music is very good; the costumes are perfect; and the locations and scenery, though made without all the special effects modern films have, are imposing and verisimilar.  Of all the films made about the Middle Ages, \\"El Cid\\" is by far the best. I will go even further; I will say it is one of the best films ever made.  I know this may sound exaggerated, but it is the truth, for few other films have such depth and beauty. Even \\"Ivanhoe\\" (1954), which may be considered the second best Middle Ages film, lacks \\"El Cid's\\" piety and  nobility.   As for more modern films, there is nothing to be said. When you decide to watch \\"El Cid\\", allthought of films like \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is put aside; all prejudice against old movies is forgotten. And when the sound of the trumpets stirs your blood, and the melody of the violin sounds within your heart, you know deep inside that this film is timeless, because it is a story of things that never come to an end. It is a story of nobility and strenght: the strenght of God, of truth and of man.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|George Martin, the man who made The Beatles awesome, has done it again. He has just made me a renewed Beatles fan.<br /><br />LOVE, a 2006 compilation of remixes, is the only remix album which I think has deserved my full $15.00. It is, like the 1 compilation, a compilation of almost 30 of their coolest tracks. It has a few beats changed, and a few classic songs mashed together to make them how they would've been.<br /><br />Don't let the title LOVE fool you- LOVE is 26 tracks long, and dosen't have 26 love songs on it. It's 26  tracks of pure awesomeness.<br /><br />Let me make a few notes about a few of the the tracks on this album:<br /><br />-The biggest single is the Tomorrow Never Knows/ Within You Without You.<br />-Some of the songs on here are alternated. For example, in \\"I am the Walrus\\", the drums are different.<br />-All of the songs lead into each other, as if the entire album is one looong song.<br />-Did I mention this only has the best tracks on it?<br /><br />So forget the 1 compilation. This complation will BLOW YOU AWAY. It will also renew old fans and get them back to their Beatles listening habits, like it has done to me.<br /><br />And also if you want the real deal, I reccomend you get [[ASIN:B000JJS8TM Love (CD + Audio DVD)]]. It's a DVD and a CD, and the CD has the entire album in a 5.1 mix.<br /><br />So buy this today!

B000NVIXFK|4.0|What amazes me about the new album from Rush is that they are going on nearly 35 years of being together and can still write & perform music in the manner that they do on _S&A_.  After _Test for Echo_ in 1996, I feared that Rush had bottomed out.  That album seemed like a band just going through the motions (\\"Half the World\\"), coasting on comfortable arrangements (\\"The Color or Right\\"), and just coming up with some bad ideas (\\"Virtuality,\\" \\"Dog Years\\").  But in 2002, they released _Vapor Trails_ and made everything right again with hard-hitting, no nonsense rock mixed with great, insightful lyrics.  _S&A_   expands upon the style they began on _VT_ by adding guitar solos (which were non-existent on _VT_), different sounds (mandola, mandolin, twelve-string acoustic/electric guitars, etc.), and a more lively production all around.    Songs like \\"Far Cry,\\" \\"Working Them Angels,\\" and \\"We Hold On,\\" make the listener forget that this is the same band that did songs like \\"Tai Shan\\" and \\"Roll The Bones\\"--meaning, if those songs made you scratch your head and go, \\"This is Rush?\\"--you'll be pleasantly surprised to know that _S&A_, like _VT_, rocks harder than anything Rush has done since the 70s.  Another cool aspect of the new album is the dark nature of it which harkens back to _2112_ and _Hemispheres_.  \\"Spindrift\\" is a truly ominous song from the eerie opening to Geddy's vocal takes on lines like, \\"As the waves crash in on the western shore/it makes me feel uneasy/the spray that's torn away/is an image of the way I feel.\\"  Other highlights for me include \\"Bravest Face\\" and \\"Faithless\\" (with Ben Mink on strings), as well as \\"Good News First\\" and \\"The Larger Bowl.\\"  The only criticism I have is that sometimes songs go on a little bit too long and would've been more powerful if just tightened up a bit (\\"Armor & Sword\\", \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\"), but even with these arrangements, the songs have enough great stuff in them for the listener to enjoy.  Lastly, Peart sprinkles histimeless, powerful lines throughout (\\"though we might have precious little, it's still precious\\"... \\"but i still cling to hope/and i believe in love/and that's faith enough for me\\"...\\"how many times do we chafe against the repetition/straining against a fate measured out in coffee breaks) so that the listener is always reminded that he's still 'hopeful yet discontent.'    If you loved _VT_ and saw it as a return to form, you're sure to like _S&A_.  It takes a few listens to sink in, but once it does, you'll keep going back to it like all great Rush albums.  If you didn't like _VT_ because of its *too* stripped down nature and cold production, _S&A_ offers more color to Rush's palate.  This really is a powerful album and probably sits aside my other top Rush albums like _Hemispheres_, _Moving Pictures_, _Power Windows_, and _Presto_.
0553588486|3.0|Let this be a warning - Before you start this book, ask yourself if you want to get engrossed in a story which never is finished - where nothing is ever finally resolved.  I have read 4 of these so far, and am engrossed with the series but increasingly frustrated with the lack of resolution.  I suspect that Martin may die before he ever finishes - and I believe an unfinished tale is pretty much a waste of time.<br />The writing, the plot, and the characters are all good and well-developed, although the levels of violence and cruelty are out of hand, and you get tired of seeing the best and the brightest of characters die, become cruelly maimed and disfigured, or be corrupted.<br />As I said before, the series is engrossing, so if you read this one, you will most likely want to read the next six as well (of which only 3 are completed).  If you're like me, you will also be frustrated by the lack of progress and resolution (Ice & Fire is starting to look like Wheel of Time in that regard).
B000QFCD2W|3.0|I was lucky enough to get this new CD a day early, and I haven't stopped listening to it since. The guitar work is incredible and the story is scarry as hell! I think that King Diamond has finally got a solid line up that willl work for him.

B00005JPLW|5.0|I've seen this movie twice and can't wait to own it. Gerard Butler had the performance of his career in this film. It made $300 million in 22 days. I recommend it to all action fans.
B00005JPLW|4.0|FIRST OFF: before you read any of the other reviews, please let's clear up a few facts.  1. This movie is based on a graphic novel. The extreme colors and strong graphic visuals are in many cases very much based on exact pages from the book.  2. This movie was NEVER supposed to be historically accurate. Again, it is based on a graphic novel, itself *very* loosely based on the Battle of Thermopylae, but that's about it.   3. The novel was released in 1998, 3 years before the most recent film adaptation of Lord of the Rings, so please spare me any direct comparisons.    I give this review 4 stars based on the fact that the DVD is not actually out yet so I can't really comment on it. The movie itself was one of the most amazing adaptations of a graphic novel I have seen to date. Read the book then watch the movie, the way certain shots are matched are amazing. Sure there are a lot of scenes that could have been handled differently, but this is still a Hollywood action movie - if you want historical accurracy (nothing wrong with that) go watch the History Chanel.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|If there was any doubt that HD was worth the money, PLANET EARTH lays the question to rest.<br /><br />This series is, without question, the most breath-taking, exquisitely beautiful and stunningly filmed series ever produced. Five years in the making, $25 million in production, 2,000 days of patient, timeless, extraordinary shots of nature at her most intense.<br /><br />The breadth of the series is the planet. The pace is measured in the torrential downfall of rushing waters or beats of a hummingbird's wings or in the patient stillness of a snow leopard stalking her prey. The depths lie far beneath the surface in hidden crystal caves of Mexico. The heights are from outer space - we see our earth, as well as ourselves, in ways we have never dreamed possible.<br /><br />Truly, the Creator's majesty is manifested in the tiniest details of creation. Nowhere is it more beautifully and astonishingly depicted as in PLANET EARTH.

The directing by Len Wiseman (who also directed \\"Underworld\\" (2003) & its sequel, \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" (2006) is excellent. The story by Mark Bomback (who wrote the story and screenplay to \\"Godsend\\" (2004) & David Marconi (who also wrote the story to \\"Enemy Of The State\\" (1998) and the screenplay by Bomback is excellent. The music by Marco Beltrami (who also did the music to \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" and the upcoming \\"3:10 To Yuma\\" (2007) is excellent. The cinematography by Simon Duggan (who also did the cinematography to \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" & the upcoming \\"The Mummy 3\\" (2008) is excellent. The film editing by Nicolas De Toth (who also did the film editing to \\"Underworld: Evolution\\") is excellent. The casting by Deborah Aquila & Mary Tricia Wood (both who also did the casting to \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" & most recently, \\"Evan Almighty\\" (2007) is excellent. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos (who also did the production design to \\"Underworld: Evolution\\") is excellent. The art direction by Beat Frutiger (who also did the art direction to \\"Transformers\\" (2007) & James Hegedus is excellent. The set decoration by Robert Gould is excellent. The costume design by Denise Wingate is excellent. Just like \\"Rocky Balboa\\" last year (2006), this one is the best in its series since the original. This is an action-packed, stunt-filled feast and one of the better action films of recently.
B000055ZDT|5.0|Mother of god...this is it, dudes. In this newly popular again (oddly enough) style of music that has been tagged \\"doom\\" \\"sludge\\" or \\"stoner metal\\" by countless desperate-to-be-cool hipsters, it seems that, as a band, you have to go either one of two ways: the groove-based Sabbath-and-acid worship of bands like Sleep, Kyuss, Witchcraft and the like, or the ultra-low-and-slow \\"funeral doom\\" or \\"drone\\" groups like SunnO))), Burning Witch, Melvins or any number of bands that sound like they shot up a molasses-and-smack concoction straight to their veins. Electric Wizard defies this distinction with their masterpiece, \\"Dopethrone\\", perfecting a combination of mind-warping Iommi-worship riffs and downtuned heaviness that is simply jawdropping. I will say this: played on OK-to-crappy speakers, there is something lost that really requires a good stereo or set of headphones to get through; weak speakers just can't handle the ultra-low sonic frequencies produced.     Things start off with the incredibly short (by Electric Wizard standards, that is) \\"Vinum Sabbathi\\". Actually a pretty decent song, but only a taste of what's to come. After it wraps up, the ensuing feedback segues right into the epic behemoth of a song that is \\"Funeralopolis\\", whose drawn out intro is accentuated by the sound of a gurgling bong in the background, and may very well be the most Sabbathian moment on the album, save for the quick jam \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\". However, once the floodgates open and the band unleashes with full brain-melting force, you will be left with little recourse aside from letting your mouth hang open in dumb awe until the album finishes with the mammoth musical apocalypse that is the title track.     \\"Dopethrone\\" is easily the best entry into the Wizard catalog so far. The first, self-titled album is little more than Cathedral and Sabbath homage, although done very well; it's their most \\"fun\\" album, if that word applies. \\"Come My Fanatics\\" took things up (or should I say down?) afew thousand notches, and is a vile sludge masterpiece to this day; \\"Return Trip\\" must be heard to be believed. But \\"Dopethrone\\" is something special. The clean production might put some off, but I think it is needed to truly convey the universe-collapsing heaviness that only Electric Wizard can pull off. As far as the \\"doom\\" (whatever that has come to mean) genre goes, this stands as one of the all-time classics, standing atop the metal mountain alongside Sleep's \\"Dopesmoker\\", Saint Vitus' \\"Born Too Late\\", and the first four Sabbath albums; sonically, it exceeds all in pure low-frequency fuzz-drenched heaviness. If you are a newcomer to the \\"stoner metal\\" thing--modified hipster who just heard Mastodon last week and traded in his skin-tight Poison The Well shirt for a slightly-more-comfortable High On Fire one, I'm lookin' at you, bub--get your hands on this monolith and let class begin. This is as real as it gets.

B00005QY5Y|4.0|I think many people  have had very high expectations of Adams; as Adams has for himself. I can't help but hear the overtones comparing him with Dylan, the Stones, etc...and make the comment that these critics should count the number of Double albums each of these artists had. And, to take a closer look at many of the Dylan albums, stretching to the complete end of usable vinyl on each side. If they had more room (like the Beatles use of the runout groove in Sgt. Pepper's) I fully believe they would have used it- and then some. Dylan's plethora of albums releases in the 60's was much of a result of the limitations of the record length as it was the heaping of material he wanted to record (see BBC's history of the record).  I've heard the (re: Mr. Brough's review) \\"young artist of the CD era,\\" comment before, and feel this is a bit of a lazy cop out. Gold, is paced very well beginning with it's anthem, following with another up beat number. Tracks such as La Cienga, Harder Now, Goodnight Hollywood Blvd. are not only Adams verging on a mature approach to an emotinal topic, but very good change of pace within the context of the record.    Hey, I miss flipping my albums over too- and the craft of shaping each side as a sort of \\"set.\\" To dismiss this talented musician and writer as \\"squeeze(ing) into every minute of a disc's capacity,\\" is missing one of the points completely.

I liked the author's style of writing (language) and the way the author moved between the 2 characters' stories.  My only complaint is that the author tried to throw in everything but the kitchen sink and it all came apart for me at the end.  My disbelief could no longer be suspended.  That being said, I did enjoy it enough that I finished it in two days.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|1983's follow up to \\"The Wall\\" was as we all know right after Rick Wright left the band, but did that affect the music? Absolutley not. \\"The Final Cut\\" was written entirely by Roger Waters and in my opinion, was Pink Floyd's last REAL album. Roger Waters was the sole songwriter in the band. He wrote all the lyrics for every album and almost all the music. Sure Pink Floyd did a great job performing his songs after he left the band, but \\"A Momentary Lapse  Of Reason' doesn't have the same feel. \\"The Final Cut\\" and all of Roger's solo work does!!! If you are a fan of Floyd from anywhere between \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" to \\"The Wall\\" then you would probably like \\"The Final Cut\\" and all of Roger's following solo work more than any Floyd from \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" on.

Take a Bow is reminicent of thier older Radioheadeaque sound while Black Holes and Revelations contains more of a funk sound to it.    And if anyone is interested in the upcoming Guitar Here. Knights of Cydonia, which is also on this albulm, will be on it.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|It seems that every piece of film from the late 60's, early to mid 70's is   being dug up and being dumped right to DVD. The worst of them not even   bothering to re-mix the 16 track masters to 5.1 and use the original PCM   Stereo 2.0 or worse Mono x 2.    This is not that. This is a full restoration/quality   enhancement/clean-up??, and all out re-engineer of the audio tracks and   the outcome is wonderful, superb. This is a must for every Who fan and   IMHO if it were twice the price at $35, it is easily worth every penny. It   is indeed a true special edition.    If companies released enhanced, remastered versions of classics for DVD  media I would gladly pay twice the price for every one of them over the   normal price of a DVD. Or if every effort is made, but there are still   limitations, that is O.K., I can live with it. But can't stand the lazy   media change only. Arghh.    Enjoy this one! What a treat!

B000Q6GUTI|3.0|It can be fun to watch if you've never read the Stephen Hunter novel and can overlook some technical inaccuracies.  Or, if you can just forget about the novel and watch the movie for itself.      But for fans of the Bob Lee Swagger character created by Hunter the disappointment can be that Wahlberg's character is not the Bob Lee Swagger that Hunter created and wrote about in three novels- a retired Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant, Vietnam Veteran, and ol' squirrel hunter type from Blue Ah, Arkinsaw.    Hunter's Bob Lee Swagger represents the quintessential Scotch-Irish type of rural Southerner from the nineteen-fortysomething era.  Wahlberg's Bob Lee Swagger isn't that man.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Whoever wrote this movie was definitely in a zone to which every writer should aspire but few truly reach. I was admittedly bored with the pace of this story from time to time, but the brilliant acting of Edward Norton and Jessica Biel (to say nothing of Paul Giamatti and others) was positively enrapturing! I couldn't have turned this movie off if I had tried. I kept wanting to know what would happen next.<br /><br />I'm usually very good about seeing an ending coming. I can honestly say I did NOT see this ending coming. Anyone that did is a much better movie watcher than I! Or maybe you're just psychic. Either way, my enjoyment of this movie reached its peak when I was slapped in the face by this wonderfully surprising ending.<br /><br />I do think they could have developed some characters a bit more, but perhaps the mystery was part of the point. MAYBE that's what allows the viewer to become such a prisoner to this movie. So I'm torn. But I was also completely entertained! I knew NOTHING of this movie before viewing it but wow! I'm glad I did!
B00005NWM3|5.0|After getting \\"All the Right Reasons\\" I got all of Nickelback's older albums. While all are very good, I like this one the best. It has a grungy, hard-rock edge to it that I like and all of the songs on this album are very good!<br /><br />The songs that stand out on this album are \\"Never Again\\", \\"Too Bad\\", \\"Just For\\", \\"Woke Up This Morning\\", \\"Money Bought\\" and \\"Good Times Gone\\". I do not like \\"How You Remind Me\\" too much because of all of the radio airplay it got when the song became popular. In my view, the overplay on the radio killed  \\"How You Remind Me\\".<br /><br />While I understand the frustration of many who say that Nickelback \\"sold out\\" because they decided to go more mainstream. However, I think they were developing their sound like many other bands do and see no difference between Nickelback's sound development and Soundgarden's doing the same thing.<br /><br />While Soundgarden is, by far, a superior band (I have all of their CDs too), I can appreciate Nickelback's approach since they obviously have to balance making music and selling albums in order to make a living.<br /><br />I think down the line Nickelback can \\"return to their roots\\" and crank out an album just as good as this one. It worked for The Scorpions and Pearl Jam and I think it can happen for these guys too.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I often don't agree with Oscar choices, but this time they got it right.  \\"The Lives of Others\\" is one of the most interesting movies about communism that I have seen in a decade; it shows, as few others have, how communism suffocates human imagination...not just stifles political dissent.     A spy - Captain Wiesler - is given the task of eavesdropping on a well known playwright, not for political reasons, but because a communist boss is jealous of the man and wants his female lover for himself.  As the spy begins listening in, he begins to question the values of his society and the integrity of his orders.. Up to that point, Wiesler dutifully obeyed without question. But as the spy continues to experience the world of the playwright, he starts to live the subject's life vicariously...so the enemy ironically becomes the friend. The experience helps Captain Wiesler grow in humanity so he ultimately makes the decision to run interference to save the playwright's life.    The film details the transformation of an organization man in a hostile society...and makes us remember the great books of totalitarian dangers such as Animal Farm, Anthem, Brave New World, and of course, 1984.  (It is no accident that the key YEAR in which the events take place in this film is indeed 1984).  Instead of leaving the viewer in a state of deep negativity, \\"The Lives of Others\\" gives us reason to hope, reason to believe that goodness may prevail over corruption.  So by the end, I was deeply moved.

You might argue it is a bit old fashioned, but I think you are confusing it with \\"it s one of the Classics\\". And when something is called a Classic, it is timeless and a Must-Have!

0761119752|5.0|I just got this book a couple weeks ago because my 2 year old daughter was tired of Sweet Dreams Mimi and i needed a new nighttime book to throw into the mix. I know the excited tone i read this book in has helped make it her favorite but the words are very catchy. There is only one word it the book i don't like at that is refers to one pair of pajamas as the Ugliest you've ever seen, i replace that word with Silliest as i see no need for my 2 year old to label things as ugly. So we read Pajama time, The going to bed book, Goodnight moon and she falls asleep
B0000X61UU|5.0|I have worked out to Cindy's 1st edition since I was 15 in High School. The Next Challenge is a great way to change up the routine and up the discipline. The reps focus on every muscle imagineable. There is even a set of reps to target your back and get that smooth, sculpted tone for backless dresses.<br /><br />If you consider yourself a pretty fit person-- this workout will elevate you to the next level of fitness and physical health. The tonality and precision of your muscles will be defined (not bulky) and tightened. Definitely 5 stars!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLachlan has the voice of an Angel. And this cd proves it. I fell in love with every song. And listened to it so much, I thought I was going to wear it out. She brings to her music, the wonderful feeling of the Christmas Season, as well as some of the greats from the past like Bing Crosby. Her voice is haunting and peaceful at the same time. She draws you into every song and leaves you wanting more. This cd will be a favorite of mine for many many years to come. When I think of Christmas, I'll think of Sarah.
B0000X61VE|5.0|When my best friend first introduced this workout to me-- I immediately thought-- \\"Working out with Cindy? Is this like the modern jazzercise?\\" I didn't think that working out with a supermodel would incorporate so much intensity, strength training, and strategized target-reps.     However I still use this same workout today-- 10 years later. You really tone your muscles and after the first session-- you are beYOND sore the following day. The atrophy of your muscles rebuilding itself-- better and stronger-- is so indicative that you're really doing a workout that's effective.     If you're disciplined and commit to a regular routine of this workout-- you'll see the sizes go down in your jeans, the inches lessen around your problem areas, and the sharp angles of fitness around your face, shoulders, and hips.     Best of all-- there's a short 10-minute workout to do on off-days or days when you're just out of time. A definite recommend!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Time to kill the fanboys that flame eachother for either format with a few facts.  Last I heard, Blu-ray was outselling HD-DVD 6-1, im not saying the war is over, im saying that unless HD-DVD has a few tricks up its sleeve, they better pull it out of their rectum, and fast.    Anyway, on to the movie.  The movie was excellent.  I had to watch the screener while deployed to the desert, but all in all it was amazing.  I am very picky when it comes to spending the extra cash on a product for Blu-ray, and I would much rather snag the DVD than buy a less than epic film, and this ranks way up there.  Take my word for it, even if it is a little bit over the top, it still is a great new way of telling an old legend, buy it on DVD, HD-DVD if you want, who cares, get this movie!!!

B000PFUAO6|2.0|I was pumped to learn that the day before my wedding the 11th of August, Dream Theater was going to be performing in Chicago.  Before the CD arrived at my home, I purchased tickets for all 5 of my groomsmen, my father, and myself to see the show in Chicago the 10th of August.  Now, after listening to the CD, I think I am in a real pinch, especially after telling all the groomsmen how GREAT Dream Theater is.  I have seen them twice before.  Once in Indiana at the Gigantour, and once in Chicago for their anniversary tour.  Needless to say, the Indiana show was amazing and the Chicago show was pitiful at best.  Knowing that 70% of the show coming up in August will be material from this disc, I fear that I have just wasted $450.  There is no creativity here.  There is now flow.     \\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"Forsaken\\" both sound like something NICKLEBACK could have written!!! Where are the feel-good times of Six Degrees?  Here I was thinking that Octavarium was a bad album...  I'd listen to that CD 1000 times over hearing this piece of trash again.  I'm disappointed.  I'm disgusted.  I want my money back.  I am sick of having to jump 1/2 way through DT's songs just to find some real music.  I think I'll just stick to Porcupine Tree and Symphony X from now on.

Please if you have a family,or even if you don't<br />I highly recommend this book you will not be dissapointed!<br />Poor Grover you really feel for him after each page!<br />Also recommend WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE! and WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS!<br />NOTE: I have to mention that it was Grover who got me to break<br />my arm(till this day can't touch my right shoulder) I was watching<br />him do his famous SUPER-GROVER the one wear he wears the trojan<br />helmet...Anyway I put a towel around my neck and went outside<br />climbed a railing and \\"JUMPED\\" landed hands first! \\"OUCH\\"!<br />Broke my arm that was in 74(year ouch)
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Systematic Chaos is one album that shows that emotions and music do go together. With this medley of heavy riffs and soft melodies, your ears will be hungry for more after each song. The amount of solo's are less than previous albums, but the technical aspect of this album stays true to Dream Theater's skill. Many of the songs are  concept songs, and have beautiful melodies along with their amazing lyrics. The song, \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" is probably one of the heaviest songs put out by Dream Theater. With a technical breakdown at the end, and an intricate intro, this song will have even the hardcore fans listening. People will keep listening to this album many times, even if they have listened to it a dozen times already.
B000EQH2QK|3.0|I like Shakira's music most of the time. Even tough I have her whole cd collection (the ones that you can find in stores because her first and second are impossible find). Not all were for me good. \\"PIES DESCALZOS\\" next with \\"FIJACION ORAL Vol.1\\" are the best.  In 2005 after being tired of hearing her ALL THE TIME on radio or TV I bought \\"Fijacion ORAL Vol.1\\" and I must say that I was impressed, the cd was really, really good, so of course when the second volume was released I bought it without hesitation but this time I wasn't very thrilled and I think that also the public had the same feeling for the cd as I did. The cd debuted on Billboard's Top 200 albums at #5 where it peakd and flopped very fast in almost every music chart. The first single \\"DON'T BOTHER\\" was good but nothing special and didn't make either an impression (Top 50 on Billboard's Hot 100). From my point of view the best songs on the original version were \\"HOW DO YOU DO\\" a very strong song that sounds very good along with \\"ANIMAL CITY\\", the English version next to Cerati of \\"DIA ESPECIAL/DAY AND THE TIME\\" from the Spanish cd and finally the biggest track for me, \\"ILLEGAL\\" featuring Santana on lead guitar. In overall the cd sounds weak and maybe Shakira or her record company noticed that and along with the poor selling they decided to re-release the album with a new song that made the album see brightness for a brief moment with the mega hit \\"HIPS DON'T LIE\\" one of the biggest singles of 2006 but that wasn't enough to keep the album from falling again to the darkness. The third single \\"ILLEGAL\\" went nowhere and that's a pity beacuse of the great track it is but I think that the reason why it didn't hit was because even tough Shakira has a great voice, that doesn't mean that you don't get tired of listening it and \\"HIPS DON'T LIE\\" was good for her but it also made people tired of her voice. Maybe this happends to me beacuse I live in a country that speaks Spanish and I've been listening to her musicnon-stop ever sience \\"LA TORTURA\\" which is a very good song and I believe that it's going to be a classic.  Anyway, I think that the album is not that good really, just a couple of songs are good. If you speak Spanish I would recommend \\"FIJACION ORAL Vol.1\\" or \\"PIES DESCALZOS\\".
B000MNP2KI|1.0|Its a shame that relentless violence takes the place of a good story and character acting. There are parts that are not suitable for human consumption. I'm sure Daniel Craig is a good actor its such a shame.
B000002J1M|4.0|This is a seminal record by the original Genesis - before they descended to pop/tatty end of things. Superb instrumentation, good use of backing musicians, fabulous, challenging lyrics. Seems ageless.
B0000009LF|5.0|David and crew really were a focused band by the time Ziggy was released. Songs like Five Years and Soul Love are some of the best song in rock music. No one was producing anything close to this group during this time. Even though a lot of focus is on David Bowie, he would never have come up with the sound without Woody, Trevor and Mick. Often the sum of its parts is better than the individual parts.
B000002GWJ|5.0|I would highly recomend this album for the Tom Waits fan and the Tom Waits curious.  I am a big Tom Waits fan myself, and this album is one of my favorites. It's from his earlier stuff, and shows us a bit of a transition from his crooner stuff, to the more weird and wacky. the songs are great, at times like orchestra crooner stuff, and at times real jazzy.  I recomend this to the person Curious about Tom waits because it shows his unique side, yet it is still very accessable to someone used to more mainstream stuff.  Great Album! Get it!
B00003CXAT|3.0|I read Jurassic Park for the first time in 1992, right after the paperback edition was published. I had never read science fiction novels before JP. I just devoured it during a flight from New York to Costa Rica.  I was captivated by the smart extrapolation of science, particularly the clever use of biotechnology for breeding extinct animals, the warnings about uncontrolled uses of new technologies (Crichton's recurring theme), all the new and updated information about how dinosaurs really were, and by Crichton's trademark in his earlier works, a storyline full of verisimilitude, imagination and originality. What a great SF novel this is!<br /><br />And then, in 1993 my disappointment was as high as my expectations were for the movie, except for the new computer-generated (CGI) special effects, the dinosaurs looked very realistic, fully integrated with the actors. The merit of the movie is indeed the successful introduction of CGI, a technology that was a revolution in cinema, from which we are benefiting from up to these days. Together with Star Wars and The Matrix, JP is a landmark in modern cinema's history. Just for this reason is worthwhile to own the DVD, or if you still have small children, they will love it.<br /><br />As compared to the original plot in the book, the movie it's a deception, and it's also misleading to judge Crichton's work. Spielberg made a typical kids movie out of the original plot. Also, the brief scenes showing Costa Rica are ridiculous, the setting is a fake with a 100% Mexican flavor. The book makes a more realistic description of how Costa Rica really is. Michael Crichton did his homework, Steven Spielberg did not.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for the sequel, Crichton wrote a PG-13 action movie script instead of a good SF novel, including the resurrection of some of the key characters who had died in JP I. Then Spielberg changed the plot again, and the resulting JP II (\\"The Lost World\\") was even worse, including an undeserved ending, sort of King Kong craze in the US streets.<br /><br />For those of you who were kids or teenagers in 1993, when you watched the movie for the first time, I highly recommend you to read the book, especially if you already are a SF fan. Thereafter,  watch the DVD and compare. You're not going to regret it.rt of King Kong craze in the US streets.<br /><br />For those of you who were kids or teenagers in 1993, when you watched the movie for the first time, I highly recommend you to read the book, especially if you already are a SF fan.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|This movie shows Berlin at it's finest/Darkest hour. Even with a war going on people still managed to have a great time and forget about the dark cloud above their heads. Liza as Sally Bowles was pure genius. Whenever you have self doubt  watch this movie and u will have a whole new look on how u live ur life....
B0006J28KU|5.0|I've been a Heat fan since I caught it on VHS years ago.  I also have found Michael Mann to be a pretty consistently solid director, with a few exceptions.  After seeing Miami Vice on DVD, and being blown away by a movie that I had LOW expectations of, I had to revisit Heat.  I was not dissapointed.<br /><br />This movie FLIES by, and at 2:45, thats no small feat.  I honestly missed some of the character development the first time, but I caught it and savored it this time.  Mann shows all sides of these complex characters in the time he's given, and makes you alternately love and hate the aspects of them, but ultimately UNDERSTAND them.  Pacino is who he is.  Deniro is who he is.  Conventions such as laws and marriage wont change them, and make us appreciate (with some reservation) people who have found such singular purposes.<br /><br />The thing I find the most gripping about this movie is its authenticity.  There is a genuine quality to the dialogue and the actions of the players that really remove the suspension of reality that you often have to have in an action movie.  Some say the side stories of the serial killer and Pacino's disfunction at home were unncessary, but I feel there isnt a minute of this movie that should be cut.  Like Miami Vice, every scene in some way enriches the experience, and make this one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It just took me a few years to realize it.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|I wish I could give this cd more stars, but my average rating for a song on this collection is only 2. I know there will be people who don't like what I have to say, but I have to be honest. And I think there are a lot of people who are giving My December 4 and 5-star ratings simply out of loyalty which is just wrong because then the average rating is going to 4-1/2 or 5 stars, making this look like a really great album when it is not. It is already at 4-1/2 stars and Thankful is only 4. My December is not better than Thankful.     Kelly Clarkson should stick to what she does best, which is probably singing. Someday she may be a better songwriter, but for now she is still too green to be trying to write an entire album on her own. If she wants to try different genres of music, I'm all for it, but she should know when to ask for help when she needs it. This is often the case with singers. Pat Benatar, for example, is an outstanding vocalist but her songwriting abilities were acknowledged to be limited. This rings true; most people don't excel at everything.     As an example, some of the songs on My December sound unfinished and they don't satisfy. In Can I Give You A Kiss, a few catchy notes get repeated over and over as if she got stuck there and didn't know what else to do. \\"I tried to warn you, I've been a mess since you've know me, etc.\\" The foundation for a good song seems to have been laid but was never completed. What should have been only part of a song became the whole song. Same with Hole, Don't Waste Your Time and Judas. In the hands of, or with the help of, a more seasoned songwriter the result probably would have been better.     There should have been at least two or three songs that were both well-written, upbeat and uplifting. The best songs (Sober, Maybe, Irvine, Chivas, Be Still) are too mellow and sedate. But the more up-tempo songs are hampered either by being too angry (Never Again, Judas, Hole) or by being poorly written (One Minute, Don't Waste Your Time, Can I Have Kiss). As a result, there is nothing on the cd that makes me feel good AND is fun to listen to. Yeah is a funky song (A+ for originality), but it cannot redeem an entire cd of subpar material. There just isn't a song here that makes me want to put it into my cd player in my car and listen to it while I'm driving around town, and that is disappointing.     On the positive side, Kelly is a singer of wide musical range. I am starting to believe that there is no kind of music that she cannot sing. I think she could put out an R&B or even a country album if she wanted to. It is to her credit that she did such a stellar job with \\"A Moment Like This,\\" but the material on My December proves what an un-KellyClarkson kind of song that really is. She is possessed of too much talent to be pigeonholed and I am glad she is not allowing herself to be. If nothing else, My December gives us a chance to get to know Kelly better and that alone may make this cd worth owning.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|buy the MVI DVD of this LP.  You'll love it.  Its a great listen or view or both w/ pictures from the songbook on the tv 1 for each song just like in the book and easy browsing with your remote + bonus featrures that rock!!!
B000OCZD60|5.0|Sequel to the earlier Mad Max movie, The Road Warrior is a blast of fun and looks great on HD DVD.    I hadn't seen this in years but picked up the HD DVD right away, and it sure looks good.  A very fun movie with the classic anti-hero hero Max and, of course, the great chase scene at the climax.    I seem to recall that the third movie, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, was a bloated bust of a sequel, but that hasn't been released on HD DVD yet...

B000NA28IE|4.0|If you haven't read the books, this was a decent movie.  But I also think the only reason I understood some things is because I read the books.  Like many movies based on books a lot was cut out or switched around.  So much so that I don't see how they can make any sequels without seriously upsetting the story.  They barely touch on the elves and dwarves(which seem to be humans, you can't tell).  Also skipping the werecat was like in LOTR skipping Tom Bombadill.  How can you skip a character that had a major impact on the story?
1400031362|5.0|Keeps your interest all the way through the book, in fact, throughout the whole series.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Loved this movie.  The ending was really messed up, but was good.  These two old friends go to great lengths to better their magic shows, while at the same time trying to trick the other into different circumstances.  I was expecting real Magic to be involved, but Science is the key factor here, as is most Magic Shows.  The love story and how they intertwine with each others lives was complicated and takes a few minutes for you to get a good grasp on at the end.  You finish the movie, thinking \\"Did he really do that?\\", \\"How was that possible?\\", \\"Which one is he?\\"...You'll understand at the end of the movie.
055358894X|5.0|What a wonderful book.  Intelligent.  Rich.  Funny.  Complex.  And I couldn't put it down.  This is the sort of rich fantasy George R. R. Martin writes.  And yet Lynch's book is radically different; his world is smaller, simpler, more rooted in humanity.  I picked this up on a whim.  ($6.99??? Of course it's worth it!)  I was moved by the critic's praise (including Martin's).  And they were right on.  Lynch IS A MAJOR NEW TALENT.  I can't wait for the next book in what I hope will be a long, successful series.
1594489505|5.0|Superb book!  I couldn't put it down.  After reading \\"The Kite Runner\\", I couldn't wait for Khaled Hosseini's next book - the wait was worth it!  These are two of the most powerful, moving books I have ever read.  Hosseini opened my eyes and expanded my limited knowledge of life in Afghanistan.  I have passed my books to my friends, but INSISTED that I get them back - these are two books that I will keep in my personal library forever!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this for my husbands 45 birthday.  He has spent hours watching it and my 15 year old son loves it.  Yesterday, we had the family over for 4th and had it playing in the tv room.  Family wanted to watch it over watching the fireworks outside.  I would recommend this to any age group.  It is just awesome!!!
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Very good show, not as fun as Spirited Away, and it kinda left the story hanging at the end.. But the adventure was great. I bought it for my 6 yearold, she enjoyed it alot.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|I hadn't heard a lot of Arcade Fire before I got this CD but I'm definitely getting their other releases now. I think I like them so much because Win Butler sings a lot like Ian McCulloch from Echo and Bunnymen who I love. If you're that kind of thing, you'll like Neon Bible.
B000PMGNK4|4.0|So, the first thing I have to say is yes, I am glad I bought it.  However, don't make the same mistake I made... I, for no good reason, assumed that the team who created GITS: Innocence created GITS: SSS.  Wrong!!!  Do not expect the same dramatic, philosophical, and artistic depth and sophistication found in GITS: Innocence.    The team that created this film is the same team that generates the series.  As a matter of fact, this film has a \\"made-for-TV\\" feel about it.  It seems as if two individual stories were grafted together as one which may account for some of the disharmony.  It also felt somewhat episodic, as if filmed so that it  could be easily serialized.  (As an aside...The involvement of Nissan makes me a little nervous for the future, hopefully the studio doesn't lose their artistic vision and swing too far to the commercial side.  The concept cars were cool but they weren't anything the art team couldn't have created on their own.  With the exception of one scene, the cars simply were not integral to the film.)    Now, with all of that said, I love the series.  This film is on par with caliber of the 2nd season.  The art, audio, general plot, English dubbing, etc. is top notch.  (Writing?  Well...the continuity people responsible for ensuring that the story flows smoothly could have tightened things up a bit.)    If you love the series, you'll love this movie.      So, yes, I'm glad I bought it and I'll probably watch it again today!!
B00005JPAO|5.0|For the performance she presented in The Queen, Helen Mirren absolutely deserved to win the Oscar for Best Actress as she did. She was convincing in one of the most difficult roles any British actress could be called upon to play, and it was also courageous of this former Bond girl, often noted in American memories for being cast as great beauties and occasional seductresses, to lose herself as completely as she did in the Queen's stately contained matronly presence. Also deserving of note is Michael Sheen's chameleon-like transformation into Tony Blair. Sheen should have gotten more acclaim than he received for the skill with which he brought a still-relevant political figure so deftly to the screen. James Cromwell was great as always as the cantankerous old tyrant Prince Phillip, and only the casting of Alex Jennings as the Prince of Wales puzzled me, as Jennings, though a sound actor, did not seem to fit the part as well as many others could have. The Queen was, I thought, a riveting take on events that remain fresh in the collective minds of people around the world, and it managed to disarm cynicism and capture a convincing account of what would ordinarily be the private moments of highly public figures. In my opinion The Queen was so much better than anything nominated against it as Best Picture at last year's Academy Awards that it represented in its loss in that category the greatest mistake in Academy voting since Shakespeare In Love displaced Saving Private Ryan to take home top honors. See this film. It's a work of cinematic art.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|You think you know Planet Earth?  Think again.  This is the most indepth, unbelieveable presentation ever of our natural world.  In Blu-Ray HD, it is beyong breathtaking.  I am 57 years old and a nature show enthusiast, but many scenes were of such beauty and majesty that I was left gaping like some little child seeing his first circus ever.  This is a must-have for anyone who loves this planet and its innumerable wonders.  Many will come away from viewing this series and feel small by comparison.  I came away feeling priviledged to be a part of the great mystery, majesty, miracle that is our home - Planet Earth.

After listening I believe it his her best work yet!!  The songs seem to reflect a lot of emotion.  All the tracks are great!  My favorite is Irvine.  I hope the sales can show the record execs that Kelly knows what she is doing.  Buy this cd!

B00005JMCN|4.0|I always take these All American Hero/Feel Good type movies with a grain of salt, but this one was pretty good.  I was glad that it was made without a lot of swearing and with only one not-really-sex scene (not that there was any call for it, but it seems sometimes Hollywood puts it in where it isn't needed).  Tobey Maguire manages not to be too irritating, non-actor/real jockey Gary Stevens plays his role just fine, and Chris Cooper is probably the only one who could have pulled off Tom Smith without making him either completely flat or a caricature.    Yeah, it's idealized and the depiction of War Admiral is completely inaccurate (War Admiral was also a very small, unlikely-looking racehorse, not a 17-hand monster).  What did we expect?  It's not a documentary so don't watch it looking for historical accuracy.  It's Hollywood; have fun even if it is fiction.
B000GRUS22|3.0|I am an Enigma-holic who owns all the albums and love them all.  As a musician myself I'm always searching for the ultimate unique musical experience and \\"A Posteriori\\" is awesome.  As a whole the ambient spacey grooves here tend to be more similar from track to track and never change much dynamically or tempo wise - they tend to put the listener into a hypnotic trance and that is a good thing when you want that type of feeling.

B00005JPCF|2.0|I finally rented this after a family friend said she loved it so much she went to see it three times in the theater.  Now I know better than to trust her taste!    On the up side, the animation was beautiful and I thought that the take on human researchers as alien abductors was pretty clever.    On the down side, another friend warned me that she thought it was sexist, and I had to agree with that.  I was also really surprised at the obvious sexual double-entendres in a movie that clearly meant to cash in on the cuteness of penguin chicks and seemed to be aimed at children.  It IS possible to make a funny movie without resorting to toilet humor and crass jokes if you're genuinely creative.    Additionally, the musical-ness of it was BORING.  The whole movie felt like about two minutes of plot scattered around in ten-second bits between overblown hip-hop and pop covers.  Again, too; I'm not sure I thought all the music was appropriate for kids.  And where do penguins who doubt the existence of humans learn Beach Boys songs, anyway?    It was repetitive.  Mumble keeps getting dissed over and over and over again.  Okay, already; we get the point.  The story line was 100% predictable.  The characterizations were weak, at best.  I thought maybe it was because it was a cartoon, except that I cared about the cars in _Cars_ way more than I cared about the penguins in _Happy Feet_, and the cars were not only cartoons but weren't even animals.  The voices were obnoxious (Okay, Nicole Kidman, enough with the breathy bimbo thing already); Robin Williams needs to be put out to pasture before he gets any weirder and more egomaniacal.    I cannot believe the Oscar people thought this was better than _Cars_.  What were they thinking??
B0009J8GWQ|4.0|As everybody else has pointed out beforehand, Darkness is much, well... darker than previous Springsteen albums. His working-class losers were no longer romanticized. They were now just... losers. Losers without hope. It was their fault that they were in whatever situation they were in, and they had no way out. Badlands sets the tone right away. At least the defeated lyrics do - ironically, it's set to a happy upbeat pop melody with memorable sax and guitar solos. Badlands was a major radio hit, and it's always been a favorite of mine. Even better is Prove It All Night, which sounds similar to Badlands (actually, several of these songs do - we'll get to that later), but manages to lift itself above it simply because the sax and guitar solos are better. Oh yeah, and it's a cynical song about sex. How many other sex songs are cynical? Adam Raised a Cain is great: a totally original pun in the title, lyrically an awesome meditation on Bruce's troubled relationship with his father (though I prefer the similarly themed Independence Day), and it's probably the heaviest rocker Bruce ever committed to tape. His vocal on that song goes from mumbled in the beginning to downright fierce during the last verse, when he drops all pretense of self-control and just screams for his life. \\"IN THE BIBLE CAIN SLEW ABLE! AND EAST OF EDEN, MAMA, HE WAS CAST...\\" Whoa. Just whoa. Something in the Night is a very underrated song, and it has more of that emotion: I especially love the beginning, with Bruce spending about a minute screaming \\"Whoa......oh, all right......whoa......oh, all right...... WHOA-OH-OH-OH!\\". Spectacular. So are the lyrics.<br />Unlike last two albums, Bruce doesn't go grandiose here at all. Only one song is stretched out to epic length (Racing in the Streets), and that isn't exactly huge like Jungleland, Backstreets, Rosalita or New York City Serenade. It's quite restrained, actually, and quite beautiful. Oh, and the soft/loud dynamics and intelligent lyrics on the bitter title track really grab me.<br />Now for the album's biggest flaw: a lot of it sounds alike. Now I quite like the Promised Land, but it's pretty much a rewrite of Badlands (even the titles are similar!) with a harmonica thrown in. Like I said, still a very nice song (Bruce's guitar tone on the solo stands out to me), just a bit samey. And either Streets of Fire is an adequate but inferior rewrite of the title song, or the title song is a totally superior rewrite of Streets of Fire - sonically and structurally, there are several similarities between the two.<br />Now the only song I don't really like is Candy's Room. How was it a hit? I don't get it. It's void of emotion, excitement or originality, and the guitar solo is a proto-'80s guitar solo. Ouch.<br />There's a bit to complain about regarding Darkness, but really it's quite a noteworthy release.er title track really grab me.   Now for the album's biggest flaw: a lot of it sounds alike.

I was so tired of the brain dead Star Trek plot formulas and idiotic Star Wars bite-sized happy meals and the aggressive anti-theistic tone to most small scale sci-fi.<br /><br />Scalzi does a beautiful job setting up the suspense of 'what's next' in the first thrid of the novel and executing the logical consequencse as the plot develops.  His technological ideas are unique. I won't spoil what they are, because each new revleation is a treat to be savored.  But they are NEW and PLAUSIBLE.  At least to me.

B000Q6GUTI|4.0|**No Spoilers**<br />What made the action movies from the 80s so memorable? It's an easy question. The muscle-hero macho superstars, \\"revenge\\" themes, big guns and explosions are trademarks from that golden decade of movies. Shooter brings back all those feelings from that era by emulating most of the classics (Rambo and Commando comes to mind). Is shooter a bad film? We'd think so, but it's not boring--we enjoyed most of the cheese. Despite the silliness, Shooter gets a \\"passing\\" grade due to the action scenes and some unintentional laughs.<br /><br />Story:<br />A US military mission goes wrong in Ethiopia when skillful US sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) looses his partner and best friend Donnie (Lane Garrison) by enemy fire. After that terrible incident, he retires from service to live a peaceful life in the woods with his dog. Suddenly, a group of government agents led by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) informs him that there is a sniper out there ready to kill the president within days--the president will have three appearances. The Colonel wants to recruit Bob to give some professional advice of how it can be done by thinking as a sniper and he agrees. After studying the locations where the president will appear, Bob thinks that there is only one place this can be done and he is right.<br /><br />Philadelphia is ready for the president's speech. Our snipers, special agents, and police are in place. Bob, Colonel Johnson and other agents are hiding in an abandoned building nearby looking by the window at the outdoor stage. Fear is in the air. When Bob tells the agents that the conditions are right for the shooter to strike, a remote control rifle--from another location--fires, but kills an Ethiopian representative right on the stage. The president is unharmed. Suddenly, a police officer shoots Bob and he falls off the building and runs away bleeding--literally. The whole thing was a set up from the get-go and now they blame Bob for a crime he did not commit. As he hides from the law, he makes new friends along the way that will help him to clear his name and start his revenge--he will also find truths about what really happened in Ethiopia.<br /><br />Review:<br />Most of the people looking for action are going to get just that in Shooter. It delivers mindless action sequences, bad dialogue and campy humor--those pretty girls on screen don't hurt either. Big guns and explosions are cool, but the \\"references\\" from other movies like Rambo are very noticeable. In other words, the film is not original. It seems like director Antoine Fuqua wants to bring the 80s back because we see our hero running around, showing some muscles, falling for the girl, killing hundreds of soldiers and even destroying a helicopter--A Team anybody?<br /><br />Despite Shooter's entertaining moments, we find things that just don't work at all. We are still trying to figure out why Danny Glover talks like Don Vito Corleone from The Godfather. Perhaps the US government is like the mob that will destroy anybody who is against it--it's funny that all the evil ones are republicans, very clich&eacute;. We also see a goofy FBI agent that Bob teaches to be a sniper in just few days, and then starts shooting soldiers like a pro. We also got confused about all the terminology about the rifles used in the story. It sounds cool, but leaves the audience scratching their heads.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg's acting is acceptable--he is not overdramatic and carries the movie all by himself. He is just much better than Stallone at least. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same thing for most of the cast who are nothing more than cardboard characters.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />All of this will look familiar to you. Shooter keeps the Rambo's tradition alive by following the same \\"Betrayed by his Government\\" formula that made Stallone famous back in the 80s. If you enjoy action movies from that era--as we do--by all means go see this film.om the law, he makes new friends along the way that will help him to clear his name and start his revenge--he will also find truths about what really happened in Ethiopia.

0446677450|5.0|Very good advice.  The first two chapters were slow for me, so I jumped to chapter 3 and read from there.  After I finished reading to the end, I jumped back to chapters 1 and 2 to get the background information.  Good solid advice about personal finance.  I enjoy Robert's explanations of financial concepts.  I purchased a copy of this book for my brothers and friends.
0743289684|5.0|Thank you for educating me, keeping my heart warm and  my brain active.  The book was very well written--full of  honesty,  information , compassion , history, religion , humility and humaness.  Bravo Ayaan, you did a great service for our conuntry, hopefully your ancestry and for Europe as well.  You taught us history by telling your story-a story line that was real . I received a personal  enlightment as well as you did  the last quarter of the book.    You are a pioneer , a woman of distinction. Hopefully, you will be an angel --with wings to those who are destined to follow you.  Before reading your book- which is like an autobiography --I remained ignorant to the complexities of 3rd world countries, And to people like you .I don't want to mix up the religions at this point --I have 20 pages left to read--I savor good books and take my time especially at the end--  but I do want to say you were chosen to lead the way for both Americans and for Muslim as well. Choosen, therefore there is a God.    I am sorry you had to see and hear such atrocities and I wish you well the rest of your life.
B000CPGZHA|5.0|I'm a new fan of kylie.This was my first musical contact with k.M.I only knew the hit \\"Can't Get You out of My Head\\" . She is very talented,she can sing she can dance. she has a different voice.She has a big production in the stage.IT is a visual experience with feathers,dancers and lights.  The best songs to me as a new fan are:  Better the devil you know.  In your eyes.  I believe in you.    And for the people who insist to compare Madonna with Kylie:  *Madonna is very cold in her performance.( although ,Madonna has a better production than kylie)  *Kylie is volcan in the stage .
B000H7JD4K|4.0|Much to the consternation of some fans, the band played this entire album in concert on the latest tour.  This attests to how strongly they feel about it.  This is the best all-around album of the three since Dickinson and Smith returned to the fold.  All the songs, though lacking the immediate punch of say, \\"The Trooper\\" or \\"Aces High\\", are completely solid - not a bad one in the bunch.  Sure, it isn't \\"Piece of Mind\\" or \\"Powerslave\\", but it isn't meant to be.  It is the fourteenth album by a group of veteran metallers who are smart enough and daring enough never to repeat themselves.    Let the full flavor of this album come out.  Given the proper amount of aging, the spontaneous fermentation will create a pleasing array of tastes for your palate.  It probably won't grab you immediately.  Don't expect it to hit you like a shot of whiskey.  Savor it like a fine wine or a really quality beer.  Like a cat trying to get into a closed box that holds the catnip, all the little nuances will claw their way into your brain, scratching and howling all the while until you're hooked.  \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" in particular, is simply an awe-inspiring song.  Easily my favorite track of theirs, post reunion, and arguably one of the best of their entire career, it is both traditional and custom-shatteringly gutsy, both fierce and sublime in scope (clocking in over 9 minutes).  Man, that orchestral mid-section has me smiling and bobbing my head as the triple-axe melodies of Murray, Smith and Gers weave a wonderful web of musical brilliance.  \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\" is my second favorite (another long one), for many of the same reasons.    Dickinson is still at the top of his game.  And yeah, maybe the Air Raid Siren doesn't have quite the range as he did in 1982, but for a guy pushing 50, he sure gets dang close.  And speaking of guys pushing 50 . . . what fountain of youth has Nicko McBrain been drinking from lately?  Just listen to the drums on this record - does that sound like the drumming of a guy who pushed the big 50 BEHIND him 3 years ago?  Has this drummer not aged incredibly, just like a fine wine?  (See?  There I go again with the alcohol theme.  Man, I've got to end this review soon before I get drunk.)  And of course, as always, you can hear the ever-present influence of bassist/mastermind/main songwriter/spiritual grounder Steve Harris threading its way through every song.    OK, so the big question in your minds:  why only 4 stars?  Well, again . . . it isn't \\"Piece of Mind\\" or \\"Powerslave\\".  That is its strength, but also its weakness.  A couple of these songs just can't compete with some of the classics.  Also, I don't care much for the cover art.  That being said, diehard Maiden fans should not be disappointed by this album by any means, and any casual listener of the group will also find it worthy of their attention.

B000O5AYCA|4.0|The National (originaly hailing from Cincinnati incidentally, before moving to New York in the late 90s) have slowly but surely building their indie-music resume since their outstanding 2001 self-titled debut album. After their 3rd album, 2005's \\"Alligator\\", now comes the eagerly anticipated new album.<br /><br />\\"Boxer\\" (12 tracks, 43 min.) shows the band progressing again with, at times, magical results. The first 4 tracks of the album are in my opinion the best the band has ever been. The opener \\"Fake Empire\\" starts off very calmy before slowing bursting into almost-epic sounds. \\"Mistake for Strangers\\" is a coulda/shoulda be hard-charging radio single, which reminds me of Joy Division, of all bands, as is \\"Brainy\\", which is followed by my favorite track of the album \\"Squalor Victoria\\", which features some lush orchestral instrumentation on top of the intense drums and piano, what a way to cap a perfect initial third of the album. After that, things level off a bit. \\"Apartment Story\\" is another hard-charged song that works great. Interesting to note that Sufjan Stevens plays piano on \\"Racing Like a Pro\\" and \\"Ada\\". The closer \\"Gospel\\" is the perfect summary of the album: quiet, yet charged, it captures the mood.<br /><br />If mainstream radio would be a bit more open-minded, the National might break big. Given the sorry state of radio these days, I very much doubt it. But it doesn't detract from the intrinsic beauty of \\"Boxer\\" as an album, and the National keeps winning more fans with each tour. I just love this slow-burner mood piece that this album is. Highly recommended!
0875428940|5.0|I liked this Robin Wood Tarot deck very much.It is similar to the Rider-Waite standard deck in style.Yet,these cards are inherently Wiccan and more colorful in format.What i didn't like about these cards was that they have a confining border around the perimeter of the outer edges.This gives the deck an imprisoned feel that bounds the expansive flow of the images.A good example of a radiating deck is the Morgan-Greer tarot,it has no outer strip.When you lay them out on your favorite table or animal skin,the cards should outwardly transmit illuminating intuitive energy.Energy that can be easily attained from the card spread.People who use the Robin Wood tarot should also get the corresponding book.This completely explains the various changes made to the standard tarot cards.I would recommend this unique tarot deck to all,both novice and advanced soothsayers alike.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|You have to love a movie that starts with a<br /> fabulous premise. In this case, the life of<br />hyperbollically drawn tax auditor is mysteriously<br />linked with the fate of a character in a<br />stutteringly produced work of fiction. So far, so good.<br /><br />We bop back and forth between the accountant<br />(and his predictable love story) and the tortured,<br />blocked author. The resolution is not particularly<br />courageous, but not many movie resolutions are.<br />(the accountant doesn't die because the character doesn't).<br /><br />What's daring and admirable is the premise and the<br />splendid graphics. This is one of the most visually<br />interesting films  to trot through the cineplex in<br />a long time.<br /><br />There are also two splendid performances. Emma<br />Thompson as the author and Dustin Hoffman as the<br />professor of literature who helps unravel the mystery<br />are as good as their roles would allow them to be. no,<br />make that better.<br />The other actors-Will Farrell, Queen Latifah and<br />the delicious Maggie Gyllenhaal- seem sadly out of<br />place and call attention to the fact that they're<br />merely reading lines.<br /><br />This quirky plot would have been a lot more satisfying<br />if the performances behind it had been more convincing.
B000002GXS|5.0|An absolute indesputable classic. Among the best of the songer/songwriter, Pop/Rock albums - ever. And in the midst of the flowering of the best of that genre - quite a feat. Tom Waits never topped this masterpiece - though Small Change was close. His voice is moving and genuinely emotional - long before he later became a parody of himself. This folks, is great songwriting.<br />My one caveat is that the recording could use a re-mastering to contemporary standards. Obviously the CD is a direct transfer from the original record master - dull and thuddy. But dispite this, Waits' early genius shines through.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|My Alias collection just arrived today.  It's amazing!  The set looks absolutely amazing - As I live in England, I was expecting delivery to take weeks, and every disc to be scratched upon arrival.  When my parcel arrived two days after ordering, I was shocked.  I opened the box set, and to my disbelief, not a single disc was scratched!! I had never seen Alias before today - I had only heard good things about it from friends.    If you live in england (or anywhere else for that matter), I thoroughly recommend this DVD box set.  Not only does it work out £45 less (including shipping) than the English box set, but it is just great viewing, and amazon.com ships it very quickly.    Overall, this box set truly deserves 5 stars (as does amazon.com).  Not only does it look amazing, but it's also really great television, and once you've watched the pilot, you're hooked for life!    Buy this box set today - you won't be disappointed!
B000M5AJQS|2.0|I bought this DVD from Amazon some time ago and just got around to watching for the first time. As an admirer of Mr. Scorsese's past work, I was, frankly, amazed at how universally weak this film was. And to win the Oscar no less. It's clear he got the sympathy vote - well deserved for Good Fellas among others - just not for this mess. All 'tough guys'; no humor; no likable characters; plot holes to drive a truck through (ex.: what are the chances the psychologist would just happen to date both these guys?) There was so much use of cel phones, I was surprised to not find Verizon or AT&T in the producer credits. And hey, I'm no prude, but a profanity in every line? - come on. An average episode of The Sopranos is far more entertaining, and better written, than this. And the coup de grace in the film's last scene: - the rat on the balcony rail. My wife and I howled with laughter! - a laugh of disgust after being dragged through nearly 3 hours of this convoluted nightmare. I was glad all the principals were shot dead, so there could be no sequel.
B000002GVZ|5.0|This wonderful album came out a number of years ago as a compilation of \\"Greatest Hits\\" from Carly's first five recordings. It is every bit of that...prime Carly, at her VERY best.

AND, an album cover that's gorgeous, without being controversial.<br /><br />Of course, we know that this isn't the end of the story...the past 30 years have seen a lot of fabulous recordings by Carly [see \\"Reflections\\"], but here is where our love affair started. We were all younger then, and sometimes it's nice to think back...<br /><br />Some of you are like me, and have ALL of Carly's recordings. I do, and still I listen to this, even as I also listen to the full albums from which these selections were taken. But, for the others, you may well want to start right here.

It is based on the true story of a presumed serial killer who identified himself as \\"Zodiac\\".  He was successful in terrorising the broader community.<br /><br />Unlike most Hollywood crime films, \\"Zodiac\\" has no crisp ending where the bad guy is killed or captured and all the loose ends are tidied up.  Rather, the film concludes with the killer still at large notwithstanding many suspicions.  Of course, many murder investigations end this way but rarely so in Hollywood.<br /><br />The film is well scripted with many outstanding performances.  Robert Downey Junior as the drunken newspaper crime writer, Brian Cox as the media savvy lawyer Melvin Belli, Jake Gyllenhaal as the awkward cartoonist turned crime writer and Mark Ruffalo as the hardened cop immediately come to mind.  It's a great ensemble cast.<br /><br />If I was to have any criticism of the film, it is that it's a bit too long.  Sure, the plot is complex and details need to be explained but a film in excess of 2 ½ hours is testing an audience's patience.  However, this criticism is not substantive in the greater scheme of things.  Do not let this comment distract the viewer.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and can recommend it to all.  Its languid yet enthralling pace, its clever recreation of the time, its ambiguous conclusions and its very competent cast ensure that this is a film well worth seeing.

B00005JPQT|5.0|\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is a great film.  Even if you had been on Planet Zircon & hadn't seen the first three films, this would still put a smile on your face.  Bruce Willis surpasses recent action efforts such as \\"16 Blocks\\" & [[ASIN:B000FKO5QK Lucky Number Slevin (Widescreen Edition)]].  Len Wiseman's third film after two \\"Underworld\\" vampire pictures puts the audience on a roller coaster that leaves us breathless at the final frame.  Justin Long who may not be all that famous anymore for kissing Britney Spears in \\"Crossroads\\" does a great job as computer hacker Matt Farrell.  The opening sequence, where Willis goes to his apartment only to survive barrage after barrage, sets a pace that does not slow.  Timothy Olyphant who to me looks like he should film the Ryan Seacrest bio pic, may make you forget that he played a gay photographer in \\"The Broken Hearts Club.\\"  He also did good work in \\"Gone in Sixty Seconds\\" & \\"[[ASIN:B00005JMX6 The Girl Next Door (Unrated Version)]].\\"  As Thomas Gabriel, he smirks, he stews until we're glad he won't be around for DH5.  Maggie Q as his evil girlfriend trumps her job in \\"Mission Impossible 3\\" and plays Mai Linh somewhere between an iceberg and a blizzard.  \\"She likes to kick people,\\" Willis comments.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead from \\"Grind House\\" & \\"The Ring Two\\" plays Lucy McClane.  She puts a smile on our face as she seems to be a chip off the old block.  \\"What'd he say about me?\\" is the perfect ending for the character as she obsesses on her hormonal level.  Kevin Smith who wrote and directed \\"Clerks\\" & \\"Dogma\\" and is in the upcoming \\"Catch & Release\\" does a great job in the cameo role as the computer hacker Warlock.  Bruce Willis infuses McClane with humor that lets us laugh between thrills.  This is a perfect summer film to turn off our brains and cheer getting the bad guy.  Enjoy!
1582701709|5.0|This book was purchased for my younger cousin who once she got it stated she had wanted to get it but had not had the time.  I told her that it was strange that when I went to the library to get it it was there and the librarian was surprised himself as he stated the book just goes in and out so fast.  I think it is cumbersome for the first couple of chapters and I really don't like the way it is written (interview style with many interviewees) but the concept is powerful.  I have thought in a similar manner for most of my life that what you really want you can get.  You have to do some work on yourself and remain focused.  What I found beneficial was that the universe will provide you with what you want correlating so closely to the Bible and faith.  It also relates to other self help books in that if you believe you can achieve,  your thoughts become you and there is power in faith. I will order this book again for myself and highlight it to the nth degree!  It holds some much for people that it should be offered in public schools as a prerequisite to graduate.

B000001EXB|3.0|Oddly enough, \\"The Big Picture\\" was Elton's last top ten album of new material. The historical reason was, in 1997, Elton's remade \\"Candle In The Wind\\" tribute to the recently deceased Princess Diana was released the same day, and many record shops (including the one I purchased \\"The Big Picture\\") bundled them together. \\"Candle In The Wind (Goodbye English Rose)\\" went to number one and stayed there for months, and \\"The Big Picture\\" peaked at number 9.<br /><br />As an Elton John fan of many years, that is kind of saddening. This was Elton at his most Adult Contemporary predictable. The album only once moves above mid-tempo on the dull \\"Wicked Dreams,\\" and maybe on \\"If The River can Bend.\\" Otherwise, this is a ballad heavy experience. The arrangements aren't that varied and the songs start to mesh together in a non-exciting way. Only \\"The End Will Come\\" stands out, production-wise.<br /><br />Even more frustrating is, if you take some of the songs apart from the album and they could have been standouts. \\"Live Like Horses,\\" \\"If The River Can Bend\\" and the title track might have had a better chance to shine if they weren't buried in all this pudding. Maybe it was the fact that his close friend Gianni Versace had been murdered that made this album such a down tempo affair, but this is not an Elton Album that has held up over time.<br /><br />It took him another three years, but Elton regained his groove on \\"[[ASIN:B00005NZDW Songs from the West Coast]].\\" If you're looking for proof that Elton has what it takes in the present day, listen there or \\"[[ASIN:B000H7JDVI The Captain and the Kid]].\\" (And avoid \\"[[ASIN:B00061X95Q Peachtree Road]],\\" which is almost as dull as this.)
B000O1799U|5.0|There are three people that comes to mind everytime I see this movie, Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard and Diana Ross, known to the world as THE SUPREMES! Everyone is this film is absolutely fabulous. Beyonce, Anika and Jennifer were flawless! Jennifer Hudson deserved every bit of that OSCAR! Beyonce took my breath away and Anika stole my heart. Eddie Murphy was a GENIOUS in this movie! The entire production was incomparable, great music, awesome visuals. Thank YOU! It was about time a good movie was made on times like this. You wont be dissapointed!
B0000C1733|2.0|I'm not going to into track selection much. You can see the track selection yourself fairly easily. I will say all the songs on this album I enjoy.    However, the sound quality is as bad as it gets. It's easily the loudest album I own, and anything that was the chili peppers is flattened out as much as possible. Give It Away is a far, far cry from the original release quality.     Do yourself a favor, since RHCP have only released a few albums in the past 15 years, pick those up individually (you'll get 90% of this Greatest Of by picking up their last 3 releases). Then track down the ORIGINAL ISSUES of RHCP's early stuff, they used to care about sound quality and had some really great stuff back in the day. Just don't get fooled by the \\"Remastered\\" editions, they will have hacked sound quality just so it can sound as loud as modern releases.

B0000457HB|3.0|Have to give 3 stars but to be fair it is based on what we thought we might be getting and selected the cd based on one song alone \\"Love is in the Air\\".  We listened to the cd through to the end at one sitting and would consider it good background music for a gathering of friends but not something we would listen to again for mere enjoyment.
B000OVLBF8|3.0|The only scene that struck me as creative was when Johnny's using his motorcycle skills on the freeway trying to harass his ex-girlfriend into pulling over. The main problem with most of it is the lulls between action sequences don't have much relevence to them, no scheming or planning, so there's no anticipation or speculation about what's going to go down next or how something's going to pan out. There's nothing tying it all together. The supposed emotional character moments also were too quick to the punch to convey any real humanity.
6300215814|4.0|BaT is one of those films that gives viewers an insight into the lives and mindset of an entire period. Audrey Hepburn plays impulsive-yet-fragile Holly Golightly, a young woman living the high life in New York City around 1960. There is much about the film that is bizarre and almost otherworldly. Holly is a woman of exquisite taste and fantastic connections, with a perhaps non-existent body of work and (beyond comic scamming of her rich dates) no evident means of support. She doesn't seem to be a movie star, and (regardless of how Truman Capote may have written her originally) shows little evidence of being a call girl. She throws lavish parties, loves to hang around Tiffany's and lives alone in a largish apartment in notoriously expensive NYC. She may or may not be naïve about the \\"weather reports\\" she is asked to pass along, for a modest stipend, by a mobster she visits weekly in Sing-Sing prison. She quickly starts up a relation-by-fire-escape with Paul Varjak, a young writer who moved into the apartment upstairs. Varjak is a \\"kept\\" man, who is supported by a middle-aged society woman. Predictably, the two young people fall in love, though Holly is notoriously skittish about commitments of any kind.<br /><br />The film is smart, based on a story by Capote, and exudes a tamed version of debauched high society hijinks that must have seemed shocking when the film was released. Alcohol flows copiously at Holly's parties, with people dancing with more or less wild abandon until the cops arrive to quiet things down. The idea of mixing Holly up with narcotics dealers is pretty edgy also, as is the clear indication of the sexual relationship between Varjak and his married benefactrice. Indeed, the sexual tension is kept rather high throughout the film. In one memorable scene, Holly escapes a drunken date by climbing a window into Varjak's apartment. Holly is clad only in a nightgown, and Varjak, in bed after an assignation with his lover, is seemingly naked under the covers. Their conversation, held on Varjak's bed, is at once titillating and awkward.<br />But all is not as it seems. In spite of her seeming sophistication, Holly has commitments \\"back home\\" in Arkansas. Her impulse is always to flee, which threatens her budding romance with Varjak. The rest of the film deals with whether she will run away once again or settle down with a man who loves her.<br /><br />BaT fascinates by giving us a glimpse into Holly -- an intriguing and beguiling creature -- and the life she leads. Who is she? And how does she manage to both attract and keep so many men at bay? Hepburn gives us the 1950s-vintage portrait of the alluring female, ever in search of a sugar daddy. Yet this is also what modern eyes find repellent. Holly may be presented as the charming sum of her behaviors, but psychologically, she is a mess. She drinks too much, pretends not to understand she is being manipulated, cavorts in the scandalous limelight. She is almost a cartoon -- hardly someone who could be understood as real. Yet Hepburn brings a charm, cuteness and vulnerability to make the film very engaging. By the end of the film, you will have fallen for her like everyone else.<br /><br />The rest of the cast stands out -- George Peppard as Varjak, Martin Balsam as Holly's agent, and Buddy Ebsen as her back-home interest. The only sour note is played by Mickey Rooney, who plays a stereotypical buck-toothed, myopic Japanese neighbor forever banging into things and threatening to summon the police to ends Holly's noisy parties.<br /><br />BaT is still worth the watch after 40 years, if only to observe the world that many found fascinating in an age that considered itself more optimistic and innocent than our own.heir conversation, held on Varjak's bed, is at once titillating and awkward.

B000OPOANE|5.0|From 1996 to 2002 was just an awful time. Thinking Rush has gone away forever! When VT came, that album just hit a nerve, awoken me and millions of others!  Great songs, Peaceable Kingdom, Ceiling Unlimited,  Nocturne, Secret Touch etc...Just smokin'...I too, being a fan for 32 years, since 1975 and have seen them 31 times...Most of their albums took only 2-3 listens then bam..Or like Grace, Counterparts, Power Windows, 1 (one) listen and bam. Test took a little longer but great album.  ..I listened to Snakes album over and over and over and over, about 25 times. At first, it was just Safe?  I was somewhat disappointed.. Which disappointed me as being one of the biggest Rush fans, as I'm sure many of you say the same thing lol...I would play Snakes real Loud and sometimes real late at night at 3am after a gig in my car, \\"I'm in a band\\"...It took a very long time, It finally hit home!  By that time, all the other albums have gotten out of my head...Really, I didn't listen to any others.  Only one was VT, just to hear what all the people were complaining about and raving about Snakes. I liked VT!  Then, I started getting hyped up for the concerts. 6/29, 7/2 and now 7/6 tomorrow!  They play 9 songs off of Snakes. The wife is not musicically inclined at all, likes Billy Joel, which I do too, but also Elton, Aerosmith, Bryan Adams, get my drift? who are ok too.  So, the melody is what hits home here for her.  She went to the 7/2 concert and said the 2nd half was much better. I thought about it to come up with a reason. I said, maybe the lighting etc was not as good since the first half is during dusk in the \\"sheds\\". I honestly thought that they only did 5 songs, I then found out that they did 9 songs, and told her, I now realize that Rush is growing into a more viable entity in the world music, the whole world.. Not just playing noise, as many people hear and she calls it lol.  But she felt the songs were just, much better, on the 2nd half of the show! Which they play 5in a row from Snakes in the 2nd set and then Hope...I could go on and on.  It is good to hear that someone that thinks that some of Rush songs are noise, are liking them so much more now.  And I am someone who really eats sleeps and breaths Rush...  A final note, Please, If you havn't seen Rush, you HAVE TO GO!  They are really known for their Live shows and the songs just take on another identity!
B0002O7XWC|4.0|&#34;Some films captivate the zeitgeist of the American imagination so completely that they become instant cult favorites. But few such films prove potent enough to retain the favor of audiences in perpetuity. 35 years after the film's release, audiences around the world are still captivated by the raw vision of Easy Rider is no small accomplishment. To this day, the image of Fonda and Hopper (neither of whom knew how to ride a motorcycle before making this film) careening helmetless down the open highway to the tune of Steppenwolf's &#34;Born to be Wild&#34; defines the American biker motif more clearly than any Hell's Angel could ever hope to.&#34; Bart Zeigler<br /><br />&#34;Get your motor runnin'<br />Head out on the highway<br />Lookin' for adventure<br />And whatever comes our way&#34; Steppenwolf- &#34;Born To be Wild'<br /><br />37 years after 'Easy Rider' was first shown, I viewed the movie again. I was prepared to think I remembered the story, the story of an American myth, with anitheroes riding from the West only this time on bikes into the evil of middle America. I thought the best thing about the film was the soundtrack. It was an important film but not a very good one. Then I watched it, and I was hooked from scene one. The film drew me in, such a very good film. Not perfect but very good. Dennis Hopper's character,was so real, the dishelveled, long-haired. I remember many people who dressed and acted just like him. He directed the film and gave the character's names Wyatt and Billy, old west names discovering new territory. The acting was natural, not self-conciuous. It covers alot of territory in 90 plus minutes. The landscapes so beautiful and unspoiled. The surprises were the fact that Phil Spectre was cast as the connection- how trite and real is that? The early scene with the rancher and his family was one of the beautiful scenes of the film. Wyatt tells the rancher: &#34;It's not everyman who can live off the land, you know, doing his own thing his own time. You should be proud.&#34;<br /><br />The film comes alive when George, played by Jack Nicholsen as an ACLU lawyer. What a handsome dude, a purveyor of many roles to come. I remembered wondering about his character and thinking his Southern accent was too much and his football helmet silly. Now I understand about the football helmet and George's speech about how America used to be &#34;a helluva good country&#34;. That night around the campfire, he samples grass for the first time, &#34;Lord have mercy, is that what that is?&#34; But best of all, is Peter Fonda and the quiet, intelligent, Captain America/Wyatt. He moves through the movie with, as my best friend would say, a noblesse oblige, a retired drug pusher who casts away his past and his allegiance to time with his wristwatch. Captain America and Billy find the whorehouse George directed them to and drop acid in the cemetery with two hookers, Karen Black in a great role. It is a long acid trip that sets the standard for hallucination portrayals for years to come. It's a bad trip, but maybe they chose the wrong place with the wrong people. And all is not well in the land of the free. A brief run-in with a few local yokels leads to their undoing. I'd thought Easy Rider would seem dated. Turns out it's timeless.<br /><br />Easy Rider is a lengthy music video for the '60s culture. But it is also an honest perspective on the counterculture movement. Fonda and Hopper's portrayal of that experience is free of the romanticized tone that characterizes so many other films from this era. Fonda's dialogue the night before his death is a purveyor of things to come. Hopper is happy because they've made it to their destination with their drug money. &#34;We blew it,&#34; Fonda tells him. &#34;We blew it, man.&#34; Heavy.<br /><br />&#34;Easy Rider is the late 1960s &#34;road film&#34; tale of a search for freedom (or the illusion of freedom) in a conformist and corrupt America, in the midst of paranoia, bigotry and violence. Released in the year of the Woodstock concert, and made in a year of two tragic assassinations (Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King), the Vietnam War buildup and Nixon's election, the tone of this 'alternative' film is remarkably downbeat and bleak, reflecting the collapse of the idealistic 60s. Easy Rider, one of the first films of its kind, was a ritualistic experience and viewed (often repeatedly) by youthful audiences in the late 1960s as a reflection of their hopes of liberation and fears of the Establishment.&#34;<br />Roger Ebert<br /><br />'Easy Rider' took to me a place and time I knew intimately, and I was trasported back to those not so innocent happy times.

0689859368|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book to my kids. They enjoyed listening and we all enjoyed the beautiful illustrations. It was a very simple read and didn't take us long at all to finish. It doesn't stand on it's own, so you'll have to get 2-5 as well (which are just as great).<br />It's about 3 children - Jared, Simon & Mallory who move into a house, with their mom, that is falling apart. The house belongs to their Aunt Lucinda who is in a mental institution. They explore the old house and find a room that doesn't seem to have a door. The only way they can enter it is through the dumb waiter. In that room Jared finds a Field Guide. Inside the field guide is illustrations and facts on creatures we believe to be fantasy. They find out that they are actually real and live in our own world. We just don't have the secrets on how to see them properly. The creatures in the fantasy world do not want human hands on this book. They don't want us to know their secrets in fear of what we might do. All of them are out to get Jared and his family and retrieve the book. Can the kids make it through this mess? Read on to find out!
B000P6PVLC|3.0|There's been many so-called \\"intertwining\\" movies made over the years, and I generally don't like them because they present characters, but don't really tell stories. It's like adapting the phonebook. There's better ones like Short Cuts and Crash that at least have characters and stories I actually cared about. Magnolia was an extreme whole lot of nothing. Babel falls somwhere in the middle.  The acting gets an A+ all around, could have won Best Ensamble at the SAGs but the characters are way too isolated from each other the be an ensamble. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett did well pulling out of The Fountain and winding up in this production. The supporting actors carry their segments admirably as well. The problem is whatever resolutions their stories reach, if at all, are very anticlimatic and do not satisfy. This is more of a theatrical and/or rent type movie, not so much a buy-to-own.
B00005NGAL|3.0|Did anyone else notice the lapses in the songs as I did, or am I going deaf?!?!  I have both the video and dvd of this production, and it seemed like in the dvd:  1) the tempo in \\"Rum Tum Tugger\\" was too slow and,   2) during \\"The Pekes and the Pollicles\\", the barks could not be heard.  Strange to me- I'm curious as to whether or not anyone else had the same experience.  :)
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple is by far one of the most amazing artists of our time. Her 3 CD discography is needed in every music collection.
B000P0J024|5.0|I had forgotten how good the Traveling Wilberrys first album was. It was a joy and revelation to hear it once again in great sound. All 12 songs are excellent plus you get two bonus tracks on each album which are keepers too. Just hearing Roy Orbison's god-given voice is worth the price of admission. You also have George Harrison singing lead on a few cuts and Dylan's \\"Tweeter and The Monkey Man\\" is as good as anything he's done the last 20 years plus Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne are all in great peak form too. What is enjoyable about this is that you can tell the boys were having fun doing this. There is a whimsical, laid-back, lighthearted good-feeling about this music. The egos don't get in the way and it seems there is genuine respect for each other's legendary talents. Jim Keltner, a premier session drummer is also aboard. Next, there is a 42 minute DVD showing how they got together and also shows the boys at work and play with videos of featured songs. The second CD is from the second album (Vol. 3) which is just as good as the first even though Mr. Orbison had passed away after the first one was released. This is the best purchase I've made this year as far as sheer enjoyment. 2 CD's = rated A+ = DVD = rated A. Like a fine wine, this release will only improve with age.

B000O179FE|5.0|I highly recommend this title. I saw this film in the theatre back in 2003. It had a limited run in my area and I couldn't wait for the dvd. The dvd had some video issues but was a very solid release. The HD version is definitely a HUGE step up. The video quality is clean and crisp. My only complaint is the extras weren't encoded to HD. But overall a solid release and worthy of being part of any home theatre collection.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Dear Apple, PLEASE REMASTER ALL OF THE BEATLES ALBUMS.  THIS SOUNDS INCREDIBLE.  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I feel that this is the best of the three Fiona CDs. This is probably my most listened and most coveted CD, not just by Apple, but in general. She is an amazing singer/songwriter and this album is a display of that. You WILL NOT be disappointed by this purchase.
B000069KE0|5.0|The only reason I waited so long to buy this CD was the fact that I have it in excellent condition on LP.  Couldn't hold out forever though!  Terry Kath and Danny Seraphine are two of the most underated musicians in rock history and their abilities are on great display on this great package.  I would recommend the whole catalog they have out but at the very least, CTA through Chicago Eleven!  Buy and enjoy this band that should have been put in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame years ago!!!!!<br />Favorite cuts on this album,  Ballad for a Girl In Buchanan, 25 or 6 to 4,<br />Wake Up Sunshine.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Before you base your judgment of this CD soley in comparison to any of The Mars Volta albums you need to realize that it isn't a Mars Volta album. It is a Soundtrack for a film and Omar is even quoted by saying it is a reaction to the film. If you're a die-hard Omar fan then you'll love it. Rapid Fire Toll Booth is now one of my all time favorites and all the other songs sound great in my opinion.     I don't usually write reviews because it's so painful for me to read someone elses review especialy ones that contain the following examples. I only like their older stuff, they keep changing their style, the guitar player is too self induldgent,they should use the same producer as on their first album, there's too much ambience, there's too much guitar noodling, they've become snobs, they're not as good without the old drummer, they're progressive, they're experimental, they took a riff from some other band, I like them less with each album they put out,etc. That was in reference to all bands not just The Mars Volta.     That kinda review irritates me because it's a bunch of garbage. I wish those kinda people would just stick to their MTV lifestyles and leave the real music to those who are true fans and are more open minded. I don't know why it bugs me so much it's not like I'm defending them because I know them on some personal level it's just that some people just don't get it. I'm tired of everyone disecting the music and the musicians. All they want to do is entertain us, not create some sort of musical doctorine that should be discussed as though one was attending a seminar. As a musician I understand the need to experiment and branch out so the music making process doesn't become stale. Do you really want your favorite band to constantly repeat themselves and never evolve. People please I beg of you quit writing these cliche pointless reviews.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|All I can say is Kelly rocks! She has one of the best voices in the business and she has written a great album. I worked in the music industry for 15 years and labels don't always make the right decisions. Kudos to Kelly for sticking to her guns!
B000FZETIO|4.0|If you're an '80s kid like me there's a good chance you're a fan of John Hughes' Pretty in Pink.  When watching this special edition DVD it's apparent that this is the Queen of '80s teen movies.  With that said, it's still pretty underrated.  I'm surprised at how many people still tell me they never watched this movie!      James Spader plays the extreme a-hole and there's no bigger jerk in all of movies!  Molly Ringwald is the quintessential '80s girl acting along with some amazing songs in the background. You also have a quirky \\"She's so Unusual\\" type performance from Annie Potts (Janine Melnitz from Ghostbusters), an Oscar worthy showing from Andrew Dice Clay, and even a hot Kristy Swanson as Duckette.  You can't go wrong with Pretty in Pink, one of the '80s best teen movies.

B00005JPFC|4.0|Ratatouille (Brad Bird, 2007)<br /><br />In 1994, Pixar shot to the top of the American heap of animators with Toy Story. At the same time, the similarly placed giant of the Japanese animation industry, Studio Ghibli, started gaining American converts; a few years later, critics saw Princess Mononoke and realized that there might be something to this guy Hayao Miyazaki's directorial skills after all. Then came 2001, and each studio released its (to date) magnum opus; Pixar treated us to Monsters, Inc., while Ghibli unleashed Spirited Away, both of which are widely considered to be among the thousand or so finest movies ever made. There, their paths diverged. Ghibli, never known for being a factory, has released only a single movie since (Howl's Moving Castle), with its second in the period since slated for release in 2008. Pixar, on the other hand, who had previously followed a somewhat similar release schedule, started plowing them out like gangbusters. Pixar have released, on average, one full-length movie per year since 2003. Some studios can do that and not sacrifice the quality inherent in their previous stock. Pixar, as it turns out, was not one of them. Whereas Toy Story (and its sequel) and Monsters, Inc. are fantastic movies for all ages of viewer, the post-2001 material has become increasingly kid-centric. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing if your target audience is kids. But, as the makers of any number of kids'-movie flops in recent years (with 2006 a nadir) will lament, what does it matter if your target audience (a) can't drive and (b) has parents who cower in terror at the thought of seeing whatever it kids the kids are so all-fired excited about? The lowest point, for Pixar, came with last year's Cars; the only person I know who actually likes the movie was three years old when it came out.<br /><br />I don't know whether someone at Pixar realized that Ghibli was pulling away with amazing speed in the animation wars, or whether cooler heads finally prevailed, but Ratatouille is a long-awaited return to form--a Pixar movie that will enchant both kids and adults alike. Well, except for those who don't like rats. The story focuses on Remy (The King of Queens' Patton Oswalt), a highly intelligent rat who's obsessed with cooking. Through a series of misadventures, Remy hooks up with Linguini (Pixar regular Lou Romano), a janitor at the restaurant of the chef Remy idolizes, and Remy finds his opportunity to become a world-class chef with Linguini acting as his hands. A simple plot, as in the best Pixar movies, rapidly spirals out of control into something Corinthian in its complexity, while the visuals provide a feast of amusing details that show there's a brilliant mind at work behind the controls. Bird, responsible for the decent-but-nothing-special The Incredibles a few years ago, finally lives up to the promise he showed with The Iron Giant. This is the kind of stuff Pixar is capable of putting out when it brings it's a game, and it's wonderful to see Pixar bringing it's a game again. ****led, but Ratatouille is a long-awaited return to form--a Pixar movie that will enchant both kids and adults alike.

B00009V7T2|5.0|Before you base your judgment of this CD soley in comparison to any of The Mars Volta albums you need to realize that it isn't a Mars Volta album. It is a Soundtrack for a film and Omar is even quoted by saying it is a reaction to the film. If you're a die-hard Omar fan then you'll love it. Rapid Fire Toll Booth is now one of my all time favorites and all the other songs sound great in my opinion.     I don't usually write reviews because it's so painful for me to read someone elses review especialy ones that contain the following examples. I only like their older stuff, they keep changing their style, the guitar player is too self induldgent,they should use the same producer as on their first album, there's too much ambience, there's too much guitar noodling, they've become snobs, they're not as good without the old drummer, they're progressive, they're experimental, they took a riff from some other band, I like them less with each album they put out,etc. That was in reference to all bands not just The Mars Volta.     That kinda review irritates me because it's a bunch of garbage. I wish those kinda people would just stick to their MTV lifestyles and leave the real music to those who are true fans and are more open minded. I don't know why it bugs me so much it's not like I'm defending them because I know them on some personal level it's just that some people just don't get it. I'm tired of everyone disecting the music and the musicians. All they want to do is entertain us, not create some sort of musical doctorine that should be discussed as though one was attending a seminar. As a musician I understand the need to experiment and branch out so the music making process doesn't become stale. Do you really want your favorite band to constantly repeat themselves and never evolve. People please I beg of you quit writing these cliche pointless reviews. As for me I'm through writting about this subject for as long as I live. Omar & Cedric have been making music for quite some time now. Let's allow the professionals to do their thing and the rest of you can either tune in or tune out.
B0001GL3K4|3.0|I saw this movie on TV with several scenes edited out.  I loved it and thought it would be worth buying so I ordered it.  My wife and I watched it when it arrived - the edited version was so much better!  There were a couple of scenes that were close to soft-core pornography.    I really liked the theme of several couples and the people they love; Hugh Grant did a great job - the concert at the end was a wonderful scene.  Liam Neeson and his son were so charming - especially the running through the airport!  And the man and his housekeeper who couldn't speak the same language was my favorite of them all.    I like the movie, but I wish it had been toned down just a bit with the unnecessary nudity.

0156030306|5.0|Daniel Keyes, Flowers for Algernon (Bantam, 1966)<br /><br />There are some people who simply deserve to be beaten with their own severed limbs for being such monumental genetic screwups. No, I'm not talking about Charlie Gordon, the protagonist of Daniel Keyes' wondrous little novel Flowers for Algernon; I'm talking about his mother Rose, a woman for whom getting stoned (in the Biblical sense) is not good enough.<br /><br />Perhaps, though, I'm getting ahead of myself. The plot, in case you (like me) are one of the handful of people who never got the book assigned to them in school: Charlie Gordon is a mentally retarded adult who is chosen to undergo what is believed to be a breakthrough treatment. After the surgery, the treatment slowly beings to work, but then the changes pick up speed; soon Charlie is a supra-genius, far outstripping those who put him under the knife in the first place. Therefore, it's Charlie, with the help of Algernon, a mouse who has also had the surgery, who finds the devastating monkeywrench about to be thrown into the works. The book is narrated from Charlie's point of view, as well, which adds that little extra twist to the knife.<br /><br />You get the feeling, though, that so many of the kid's problems (that come through with him to his adult life) could have been avoided had his mother not been a braindead Neanderthal who's so incapable of seeing what's right in front of her face that it causes her more pragmatic husband to flee the household. There is a method to Keyes' madness, and it is named Rose. It is a testament to both Keyes' ability to draw character (even minor characters; aside from in Charlie's memories, Rose only gets a few pages of screen time) and his ability to manipulate through perspective that make Rose the monster she is. That, of course, is secondary to the overall plot here, but it is synecdochic of the brilliance in this novel; I'm not pointing it out because it's the bright spot in an otherwise dull affair, but because it's one of the many highlights in a scintillating character study. Charlie himself is equally convincing as both a mentally challenged individual and a supra-genius. (And imagine the rage if this book, which uses such terms as \\"bright-moron\\" and \\"retardate\\", were released today; I'm honestly rather surprised I haven't stumbled across reports of its being challenged in schools, and I figure this has more to do with my not coming across the reports, rather than it simply not happening.) Just as important, if not more so, his perceptions of others, as they change, remain faithful.<br /><br />While I'm spending a great deal of time rhapsodizing over the characterization, I'm neglecting the plot. Which I shouldn't do, because it's amazing. But--and this is a point I try to make repeatedly when I give bad reviews (maybe it'll come across better in a good one)--the plot is only as strong as its supporting acts. You can have the best plot in the world, but if you don't fit it with realistic characters, it's just not going to work. I'm going to start using Flowers for Algernon as a shining example of how the two, packaged together, make for a much stronger book than either piece standing on its own.<br /><br />Add to this Keyes' eye for detail. He adds just enough extraneous detail to the book to add another thin veneer of plausibility to it; stuff that you might notice in passing and forget about. Charlie notices these things, and since he's (in the latter half of the book, anyway) dictating into a tape recorder, he notices them, talks about them, and then goes on his way. I mean, think about it. As a side note, given a performance worthy of the material, this would make an awe-inspiring audiobook.<br /><br />Flowers for Algernon is beautiful, it's heartbreaking, it's funny and sweet and sexy and spiteful and nasty and hateful and just plain great. If you managed to avoid it during your school years, I cannot recommend highly enough going back and reading it as anadult. Put simply, it's genius. **** ½

B000JJRIN4|4.0|I don't think that this Album is better than L.A.M.B, but I still think that it is good.  I am a little disipointed that the songs don't sound like the 80's and 90's like L.A.M.B did.  I think that guy named ROCKET or wutever who rote about this Ablum is STUPID!!!! With a capital S.  Wonderful life is not the only good song on the Album! There si Early Winter, 4 in the morning, Yummy, Flourescent, and more! And what does that guy mean that Gwen lost all of her fans 21 and up?  That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard!  My teacher (27) loves Gwen? so does my sister (25) my mom (43) and eaven our nabor (50)!  I mean come on!  All in All this is a great Album that you will love

B00005JPFE|5.0|The best comedies are not the funniest; the best songs are not the most melodic; the best actresses are not the prettiest.    I bring this up because there seems to be a criticism that RATATOUILLE is not the funniest movie Pixar has put out. It does, however, have the biggest heart (not the \\"aw\\" factor like \\"Isn't that cute?\\", but in the truly moving moments that connect to something deep, deep down inside us all).    For anyone to find a talent, a passion, and to be able to pursue it without having to hold back -- that is achievement at the highest, most godly manner, as if he or she has connected to God intimately because he or she has found his or her true calling and happily gives his or her life to it. We all dream of finding our purpose in life, and dedicating our lives completely to it...but it is rare that we do -- rare that we find it, rare that we pursue it, rare that we dedicate our lives to it. And for someone to be denied that chance -- not because of lack of talent or passion, but by being told \\"you can't\\" (for any reason) -- is among the saddest things in the world. It hardly makes life worth living. THIS is the real story of RATATOUILLE.     (Confession: I am a 45 year-old guy who shed a couple of well-deserved tears at this film. I am a sucker for someone connecting completely to his or her life.)    It is clear that Brad Bird lives for this message; THE INCREDIBLES touches on it equally well. His artistry indicates (to me) that he, too, has found his true calling. His life's mission seems to be to spread the Word.

B00007AJGH|1.0|I am sorry, but this film was as creative as a pile of toothpaste on a sidewalk on a hot summer day in Phoenix. The active was sub par and the animation was done by interns.    The highlight of the film as the bus that was heading for Sunset BLVD.    Please, for the love of God, don't let your kids watch this film.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|As an avid fan of the Jane Austens and other similar period pieces, I bought this without much knowledge of the book or the movie. I was beyond surprised. The movies is excellent, with strong performances and a great story. I've since read Gaskell's book and although there are changes, the movie is very faithful to the spirit of the story.
0385340559|5.0|I've read all of the Lee Child Jack Reacher novels.  In my opinion this novel is his best yet.  It has everything a great mystery novel should have: an intricate plot, plausible characters, worthy aims, real bad bad guys and best of all Jack Reacher at his best.
1594489505|5.0|This was an unbelievably moving book. I was eagerly awaiting its publication since I loved The Kite Runner but, quite frankly, did not think Hosseini could top that. He has done it however, and then some. His characters are so finely drawn that, at the end, I felt I knew them and had lived their experiences alongside them. Even though in many ways their lives and the country they live in is far from the familiar to me, I still felt incredible compassion for these two women. I passionately despised the man who made their lives such misery and cheered on his death though I knew it would mean Miriam's end as well. The last few chapters were read through a veil of tears - to my thinking the best recommendation a book can ever get!
B00003CXIP|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  The actors are exceptional and the story rings so true.  Most boys have close friends like this when they are young and never forget them even though they take different paths in life.
B00009W0WM|5.0|I'm guessing Casablanca is the most referenced film in history. There is good reason for this, as you can cut the mystique surrounding it with a knife. It has one of the finest scripts, among other things. The story behind the writing of Casablanca is legendary. Without getting into the details, writers Julius and Philip Epstein, along with Howard Koc, would finish a scene and rush it over to the set in time to be shot; then they'd write the next one. No one knew how the story would end. As it turned out, it ended up one of the classiest and most iconic of all classic films.<br /><br />In Casablanca, isolated from war-torn Europe, political alliances and hatreds are bubbling, but no one can do anything about them, as it is a neutral country. In the midst of this hotbed, enigmatic Rick (Humphrey Bogart) owns the swankiest nightclub in town,  the Cafe Americane. It is a place to meet, drink and gamble, and to listen to Sam's piano playing; but it's also a place to plot how to obtain one of the rare exit visas to leave Casablanca and fly to the New World.<br /><br />One night, breathtakingly beautiful Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her stoic husband, Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid), show up in Rick's. Laslo is an international hero, fighting for the  resistance against the Third Reich. They have come to Casablanca because he is being hunted by the Nazis, and Casablanca is about the only place to catch a flight out of occupied Europe.<br /><br />Flashback: the story is a love triangle, but it is innocent enough. Rick and Ilsa were in love in pre-war, romantic Paris. The lovers made plans to leave Paris before the Germans marched in, but on the night they were supposed to leave, Ilsa's husband, whom she had thought was dead, resurfaced; so, she left Rick standing in the train station in the rain with no explanation.<br /><br />Now in Casablanca, Victor and Ilsa need exit visas like everyone else, but the Germans are determined not to let them leave. It is rumored that Rick has letters of transit, which are even better, stolen off two dead German couriers. But no one knows where Rick's loyalties lie. Ilsa uses her old relationship with Rick to try and get them - not so much for herself as for Victor. But Rick is still nursing his wounds from Paris.<br /><br />At the same time, Ilsa is torn between her old love for Rick and her continued love for Victor. Rick reveals that he is still in love with her; but makes a great show of not believing in causes or heroes. Is that really the way he is? Everything hinges on what Rick will do. Everyone thinks they know him, but no one is sure. As the tension mounts, his character is the key to everyone's future.<br /><br />Casablanca is full of interesting and wonderful characters, played by some of the best character actors at the time. Claude Rains is the debonair but corrupt prefect of police and Rick's friend, Captain Renault. Conrad Veidt plays the despicable Nazi Major Strasser. Sydney Greenstreet is his usual mercenary and rotund self as Rick's business competition, Signor Ferrari. Peter Lorre is the pitifully underhanded Ugarte. S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall is the wonderfully sentimental waiter Carl. Madeleine LeBeau plays the singer Yvonne. Dooley Wilson is Rick's man and pianist, the memorable Sam. The list goes on and on.<br /><br />The ambiance of Casablanca, and of Rick's Cafe Americane in particular, is part of the wonder of the film. Warner Bros. created a world that, even though it was threatening and war-torn, continues to mesmerize audiences. We can't get enough of Rick's or the interesting characters who frequent it. As they say in the film, \\"Everyone comes to Rick's.\\" We also can't seem to get enough of that classic 1940's style: the dinner jackets, the evening dresses - even the uniforms. The 40's were the apex of sartorial style.<br /><br />There are so many memorable quotes from Casablanca that you could almost reproduce the script en mass recalling them.<br /><br />Casablanca won three Oscars: Best Director (Michael Curtiz), Best Picture (Hal Wallis) and Best Screenplay (Julius Epstein, Philip Epstein and Howard Koch). It was also nominated for Best Actor (Bogart), Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Cinematography (Arthur Edeson), Best Film Editing (Owen Marks) and Best Music Score (Max Steiner).<br /><br />Waitsel Smithst Screenplay (Julius Epstein, Philip Epstein and Howard Koch).

0743289684|5.0|I enjoyed this book even though it was difficult to read at times. Her memoirs are detailed and articulate regarding her history and upbringing. I felt she had a great deal of courage to stand up and say that Islam endorses extreme violence to women and children. Her harrowing childhood with her grandmother shows this belief system. Its not about a loving God, but an excuse by the men to dominate and abuse, not just in their families,but everywhere.The title says it all. If you do not believe in Islam you are worthy of death. I felt a little sad for her that the only way to escape was to become an athiest, but again the disillusion she felt was overwhelming.

0618680004|5.0|It is not hard to guess Richard Dawkins's view on religion from his earlier books. In \\"The God Delusion\\" he finally launches a coordinated, explicit, frontal assault on the necessity / custom of people to believe in a higher being. And I should emphasize coordinated, because as a talented scientist and story teller, Dawkins approaches the problem with all the rigor of scientific proof. He analyzes and dissects the topic from many directions: arguments for god's existence, arguments against, the roots of religion and morality, the dangers of religion, the problem of agnosticism, child indoctrination, does religion deserve respect, is religion \\"needed\\" to soothe and console people. The breadth of the book is just amazing (especially considering that overall it's not a big book). Almost any topic that you will hear mentioned in a discussion of religion vs. atheism has been thoroughly covered.    The central argument against god in this book, that also addresses the number 1 claim of religious people as to god's existence, is (p.157):    1) One of the greatest challenges to the human intellect, over the centuries, has been to explain how the complex, improbable appearance of design in the universe arises.    2) The natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself. In the case of a man-made artifact such as a watch, the designer really was an intelligent engineer. It is tempting to apply the same logic to an eye or a wing, a spider or a person.    3) The temptation is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable.    Dawkins also spends considerable time trying to understand why religion is needed. He raises some interesting hypotheses. A couple of examples:    * Religion is a by product, a mis-firing of some other psychological property of our brains. The best example for this property seems to be found in children, who often believe unquestioningly what their elders tell them. Additionally, children often have \\"imaginary friends\\" in whom they believe ardently, refusing all attempts to dispute them. The child's claim that \\"even if you say he isn't there, I feel it, so it's true\\" should sound familiar to anyone who had the chance to hear some religious people explaining their faith.    * \\"Cargo cults\\" as an example of a recent, documented spring-up of religion. Google it, it's a great story to learn from.    * People don't make the distinction between believing in god and believing in belief: the belief that it is desirable to believe, even if the belief itself is false. Quote (p.352): \\"I think we all know people who enjoy the idea of religious faith, and resent attacks on it, while reluctantly admitting that they don't have it themselves\\".    To conclude, I will mention that Dawkins notes somewhere in the beginning that he wants this book \\"to convert believers into atheism\\". I'm sure he doesn't believe it will happen himself. This book is too offensive to religion, acrid and sarcastic on many occasions - all of which sounds good to an atheist (or perhaps an agnostic), but a religious person will just find it repulsive. What this book can do, however, is \\"adjust some bolts\\" in the mind of an atheist who doubts for a moment. Because no a reasonable, logical human being will stay indifferent to it - for such people it is a true pleasure to read. The book addresses so many important topics, in such a lucid and succinct way, that it is very difficult to summarize it in a review. Just read it.
B000000OMB|5.0|This is one of the few compilations I've owned on Cassette, record Album and CD. When I bought my first IPOD, this was the first piece of music that went on it. Asia is one of my favorite bands ever. To me the album is like a concept album. I can relate something to every song. Each tune has nostalgia. For the first time listener, pay attention to Carl Palmers drumming. If you're a purist like me, you'll appreciate his incredible talent. Wetton and Downes are equally talented. Steve Howe? What can I say? His Lightning fingers do all the talking. I'm a huge fan of \\"Sole Survivor\\". In my opinon the best track on the album. \\"Without you\\" will give instruction on what a great voice sounds like. Wetton has a beautiful range in his voice. The pseudo rock bands of today can't sing like this. My sons say I'm decade impaired and that I only like the old stuff. I've heard the new stuff... Need I say more?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|i bought the UK version with interesting words like \\"respearitory\\", \\"skeleetal\\" and \\"kilometer\\" (damn metric system)... Attenborough does the whole thing, so there are no Americans like on the discovery channel, but other than the narration, it's the same thing.    absolutely amazing.  i've never seen shots like this before and the behind the scenes (diaries) are almost as cool as the actual documentary.  i bought it for my girlfriend's birthday, but i've watched it twice since i gave it to her (she likes it too, but it was more of a present for me).  does that make me a bad person?

B000MQC9H4|5.0|This movie is great!  It is much better than I had expected.  I thought it would be a light, cutesy, movie, but the writing and acting was superb! Far better than I had expected.  There are many clever lines and the acting including great, subtle facial expressions.  It is a very good movie!
B000O178BY|5.0|There was a certain point in NIN's career that I gave up.  I still think that \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" is one of the best albums to come out in the musically confusing pre-Nirvana 90s, and that \\"The Downward Spiral\\" pushed many sonic and textural boundaries.  However, I did not feel the same connection with \\"The Fragile.\\"  As a result, the narcissistic nature of Reznor's lyrics started to feel like self-important whining.  I decided that the arc of NIN's career had met its natural end.<br /><br />I am happy to say that \\"Year Zero\\" confounds this impression by showcasing a significant maturation in Reznor's approach.  Rather than \\"looking in\\" at his own potentially self-absorbed issues with interpersonal relationships, \\"Year Zero\\" looks out at the potential philosophical endpoints of the Bush administration.  Its text fictionally represents a \\"neo-post-apocalyptic\\" worldview, a hypothetical framework that many post-911 Americans can (unfortunately) relate to.<br /><br />Outside of this innovative lyrical standpoint, \\"Year Zero\\" is certainly a compelling example of Reznor's ongoing sonic project.  It has noisy soundscapes that seem like they might exist in the real acoustic world, but ultimately they only exist in Reznor's own imagination as realized on contemporary music software.  This may seem like a criticism, but ultimately there are few people that have mastery in this digital medium in the way that Reznor does.<br /><br />Because of Reznor's vision, NIN is stronger and more believable than ever.  I would be hard pressed to suggest a singular track from \\"Year Zero,\\" but \\"Great Destroyer\\" and \\"Capital G\\" immediately stand out as definitive examples of both the political and sonic strengths of \\"Year Zero.\\"  I would also be remiss if I did not point out spoken word artist Saul Williams' involvement in \\"Year Zero\\" as a back-up vocalist.<br /><br />\\"Year Zero\\" is subtle.  It took me several listens to grasp it.  In fact, I was about to give up on it until I familiarized myself with the tracklisting.  Once I began to draw boundaries between the songs, I was suddenly (almost magically) able to digest them as a whole.

0743298020|5.0|I chose this book for my book club group and I must say this was an excellent choice. I found that I simply could not put this book down.   It's the sort of story that stays with you and I can't get the characters out of my mind.  Now I have to allow a few weeks before reading my next book. Fabulous!! I'm looking forward to Diane Setterfield's next book.
0060763892|5.0|Jim's done his usual work, which is to say that it is anything but \\"usual.\\" Amazing imagery and detail that lends an understanding even to those who don't have any foreknowledge of his topics, this one is a frightening insight into what might lie within us all. He takes us from the modern to the ancient and back again in the next breath, as seemlessly as ever.    I welcomed the return of old friends and references to past novels. The author continually finds new ways to draw his works together and flesh out his characters through shared experiences and memories. I was also thrilled at seeing animals become an important part of the story again, as they did in his standalone novels.    One of Jim's signatures is that you think you know what's going on, have all the pieces put together, but a single turn of the page can throw everything you thought you knew right out the window. The Judas Strain is no exception. My head is still reeling, especially knowing I'll have to wait a long time for the next one. The cliffhangers at the end will make it a very frustrating wait, but I have no doubt that it will be just as worth it.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This television mini-series was excellent.  We missed many of the shows, so we bought the set.  Good family show for young teens, etc.  Values were definitely discussed as major topics  Relationships in the \\"adult\\" phase of life explored.  Very cleanly done = we rate it PG 13.
0374105235|3.0|I really like this book overall, but I found it to be a bit simplistic.  I think that it will appeal to the masses very well since it is easy to read and understand, but I found that it left me wanting more.  When I reached the last few chapters, I felt as if the story was being rushed and thought that was unfortunate.<br /><br />Over all I would recommend that people read this.  It goes well with the movie Blood Diamond also (not that they are the same).
B000HCO83Q|3.0|The government develops a cure for the mutant gene, which divides the mutant community with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) on one side and Magneto (Ian McKellan) on the other, each backed by their respective armies.  What's good about it?  There are tons of mutants expertly realized through spectacular special effects.  It's great fun to see Beast (Kelsey Grammer), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), and others in action.  What's bad about it?  There are tons of mutants, which means that none of the characters are well-developed.  The script is a complete mess, killing off important, classic, well-established characters in off-handed ways as if they were red-shirted security men on \\"Star Trek.\\"  So it's fun to watch, but a deeply disappointing finale to an otherwise good series.

0143038419|5.0|This book was referred to me by a friend.  She raved about book but I wasn't too sure I was going to like it.  I actually love this book.  While I've only completed the section about Italy and just begining the secion on India, I have found \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" to be a wonderful easy to read book.  I have even taken to highlighting portions of Gilbert's book that speaks to me.  I love her descriptive language, especially in the Italy portion of the book where she's describing the food and the architecture.  Her words are so descriptive that I can sense her emotions.  This book for me anyway is a keeper.
0307346609|5.0|At last the seminal work by Professor Brooks has been released to the general public by the Official Censors.  Even though rough copies have been circulating the academic and military community for quite some time, there has been little heard of this work in the wider world.<br /><br />It succinctly and emotionally tracks the course of what is hoped to be man's last great conflict against man.<br /><br />Professor Brooks does not shy away from laying blame but his low key fatalistic approach signals it is simply too late as most responsible individuals succumbed to the plague or are otherwise lost forever.<br /><br />The book is chiefly about survivors, about you.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins' book should be read by all who believe in a God.  The one thing that it will reveal is religion as most of the world is currently practicing it should have died a thousand years ago.  But does it follow that just because our brains are so small and the universe is so vast we should give up the belief in a higher force (I call that force God).  Mr. Dawkins makes one mistake, the same mistake that all to many religions make, and that is if we don't take his argument on faith, then we are outsiders.  The next to the last chapter, rather than dispel my belief in God, had the opposite effect.  The closer mankind comes to understanding the laws of the universe, the closer he gets to God.  The trouble is, every major religion in the world has two thousand years of knowledge to catch up on.      We cannot raise people up from the dead.  But we can sit up at the universe and wonder why it is we are here, and find wonder in the wondering.    John Schwab

0778320448|5.0|I thought this was a wonderful story by Debbie Macomber. The author's made sure that each of the four main women in the story had depth in their character. Her style of writing just gave me the feeling that these were real people with pains and heartaches that I just couldn't help but feel attached too. I'm glad she wrote a sequel to this novel. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this novel to my friends. It's a super novel.

B00006DEF9|5.0|There's a reason this movie has earned so many accolades in the industry. It's a very tongue in cheek view of how the movie industry converted over from silent pictures to talking films. In this story, a romantic on-screen couple - played by Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen - have made many successful films together. Unfortunately for her, she has a high, squeaking Brooklyn accent that does not go with her glamorous movie image. When the studio tries to put together its first talking picture, the preview results involve laughter in the aisles.<br /><br />Gene decides to bring in his less known girlfriend, played by Debbie Reynolds, to dub in the singing and talking. In between the plot, you get a variety of musical numbers - from the classic dancing-in-the-street song done by Gene Kelly (with a fever of 103) - to numerous other romantic numbers, show numbers, comedy numbers and more.<br /><br />A true test for any movie is if it's enjoyable many years later. That's true with this movie, with a caveat. Many of the movie's scenes and costumes are deliberately making fun of other earlier Gene Kelly movies. The silent film is from his actual Three Musketeers footage, and there are many other in-jokes. If you watched this back in 1952, having grown up watching all of the other movies, all of the jokes would have been hilarious and immediately recognizeable. It would be like, in modern times, watching 'Scary Movie' and understanding all the references and jokes about other movies. However, in current times, few people have watched all of the Gene Kelly and other period movies in a row. So while we enjoy the movie's obvious charms, we miss a lot of those hidden messages.<br /><br />Still, there's a ton to enjoy in here even for first timers. The skill of the dancers is quite apparent, and the costumes are great, too. There are many dialogue bits which are laugh out loud funny. And, in a time when many movies are completely inappropriate for kids, this one is family-friendly through and through.<br /><br />Highly recommended!gh and through.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000OONTFU|5.0|These are some of the best HiDef discs yet released.  The TrueHD audio is fantastic, and the clartity of the 1080p/24 video transfer is simply amazing.    Frankly, with this set I have come to the conclusion that a good home theater with HD DVD is capable of better reproduction than you can get in any but the best commercial theaters.
B0000524CY|5.0|Director Friedkin's masterful adaptation of William Peter Blatty's best-seller is one of the most petrifying films on record. An ominous mood is established at the outset that quickly escalates to bone-chilling terror. Burstyn embodies the frantic mother, while Miller is the film's emotional heart as the tortured Karras. And young Blair would never match her outing as the possessed child. Look for a solid late-career turn by Lee J. Cobb as a curious detective. To the uninitiated, beware-this is still strong stuff.
B0000039QA|5.0|The first album was pretty tight, but this title cd album is Biggie's best work.  And even if he was still alive, i'm not so sure that he could really top this one.  It's a collector's item.

B00005AQE8|5.0|Tupac was a true MC and poet. His improvisations and lyrics were second to none.  I always said that he was the Gil Scott Heron and Curtis Mayfield of his generation because he was so insightful and knowledgable about different things from the industry itself to the politics and injustices that exist in the communities across the country.  \\"All Eyez on me\\" is a true masterpiece and is my personal favorite Tupac Shakur album.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|I watched this in the Theater and it was a great movie to watch.  Lots of Action and lots of gore.  The HD DVD version of this movie will have lots of nice EXTRAS that the Blu-Ray version won't, because as a lot of people don't know, Blu-Ray is not even FINALIZED yet and all the Extra JAVA features that are needed aren't currently supported and won't ever be on current Blu-Ray players other then the PS3.   Which is also why other movies have been delayed for Blu-Ray while they wait until October 2007 for the format to be Complete since it was Actually Rushed out into the marketplace in basically BETA format.  Movies like Batman Begins and The Matrix are a couple examples.   Others they just leave out the extras on the Blu-Ray version and release just the movie on Blu-Ray, which is what's being done with \\"300\\"     The Extra $4 for the HD DVD version over Blu-Ray is not for the extra content, but for being a COMBO disc which includes a DVD version also.  This allows you to play the movie in your DVD players also!!!  Very Reasonable price for that.      I just have to laugh at the Blu-Ray sucker fanboys that must be huge DRM (Digital Rights Managment) fans since it has Double that garbage and far more control to do things such as to disable your Blu-Ray player if they think it's been compromised.  All thanks to BD+. Which hasn't been used YET,  Let alone buy a format that's not even finshed yet, just so you can spend a bunch more money to buy another Blu-Ray player a little later.  Advertising features the system just doesn't support yet.  There are still features that will be Optional also even after it's been Finalized in October.  I won't get into it here, but Visit a good Audio/Video Forum and learn more!!!  If you really just have to have Blu-Ray, unless you like throwing money away, WAIT until the new Blu-Ray players finally get released that support the final Specs.  Which is however long after October if nothing goes wrong.     Anyway this is a must buy HD Movie!       P.S.  Watched Transformers today, MUST SEE, it was great.
0143037757|2.0|The subject of the book is Europe since the end of WWII. Such large scale histories are interesting because, although they can't possibly describe all important events, they can provide a better understanding of a certain period from the perspective emphasized by the author, e.g. economic, social, military etc.    My concern is that the range of perspectives this book focuses on is unusually broad and, at the same time, the author's opinions, even on very controversial issues, are not sufficiently elaborated upon. This has the effect of giving the impression of one-sidedness and subjectivity.    To give an example that is quite prominent in the book: concerning the conflict(s) in Yugoslavia during the 90's, the book gives a solid account of the Serbian crimes as they became widely known by the media, but it does not attempt to illuminate the motives and concerns behind the policies leading up to these crimes. This does not mean that, if some of these underlying concerns had a real basis, the crimes would be in the least bit excused, but such a analysis would have offered the reader a better insight into this important part of post-WWII European history.    In particular, the analysis of the Yugoslav conflict fails to account for atrocities against Serbians and which would seem to confirm that some of the Serbian concerns (as opposed to the way by which they addressed them) were justified: e.g. the deportation of the entire Serbian population from Krajina in Croatia or the terrorist activities of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Some of that is mentioned in the book, but only in passing and with an emotional detachment which is very different from the appropriately passionate denunciations of the Serbian crimes.    Such problems would probably not have arisen if the events discussed had been analyzed from a narrower perspective or a more extended argumentation had been provided in support of the author's interpretation.     In the same vein, the reference to the facts underlying some of the author's conclusions is too minimal and even the statement of the conclusions themselves is too telegraphic to be clear. Complex issues Europe has been trying to address for years, including things as disparate as the reform of the financial structures of EU, or Turkey's difficulty to genuinely adopt Western values about human rights and dealing with its History, are often brushed upon without any special explanation leaving the reader with only a vaguest idea of the nature of the problem and of the author's view.     In summary, the breadth of the material covered made it hard for the book to live up to the expectations for a careful and enlightening analysis of post-war European history.

0142004235|5.0|nearly everything steinbeck wrote is worth reading.    this story is worth devouring.    it's far from a \\"happy\\" story, but the writing is too good to be true, and after completing it, it's nearly impossible to find another author to chase it down with.    it'll make you jump into more steinbeck if you haven't yet.
B0002IQHZM|2.0|I heard a cut over the radio, and thought it was worth looking into.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Very poppy, stupid lyrics, totally uninspiring.  What happened to the artist who tried \\"To Catch the Wind?\\"  I guess he got old and boring.  What a shame!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this re-make of Jane Eyre. Jane Austen's Jane Eyre has always been a favorite of mine so I was really looking foward to this adaptation. I was not disappointed. Rochester is appropriately brooding but surprisingly charming and likeable. Jane is a strong, quiet presence who perseveres despite her misfortunes in life. The only point I would bring up is the repeated reference to Jane's \\"plainness\\". I didn't think Ruth Wilson was very plain as Jane and so that deterred a bit from the concentration of the film, but other than that, if you are a Jane Eyre fan, this is a great version to watch!

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Ripe, Fulfilling Romantic Classic<br /><br />Anne  Elliot and Frederick Wentworth's romance came to a sudden halt in 1806. Anne, the daughter of a conceited and spendthrift baronet, loved Wentworth but was advised by her family's confidant, Lady Russell, that the match was inappropriate, as Wentworth had no connections or money. Now 8 years later, because of her father's excessive financial debts, Anne's family is forced to retrench, and sublet their estate. The family retreats to Bath, where, to the delight of Anne's father, they can maintain their privileged lifestyle on a much smaller budget. The family's home, Kellynch Hall, is to be let by an Admiral and his wife, who, coincidentally, are related to Wentworth. This liaison throws Anne back into the society of Wentworth, now a dashing Captain in the Royal Navy who has amassed quite a fortune in privateering. The Captain has caught the attention of Louisa Musgrove, whose brother married Anne's sister, Mary. Meanwhile Anne, now in her late 20's and showing signs of physical and emotional stress, is surprisingly courted by Mr. Elliot, heir to her father's estate, Kellynch Hall. The question remains as to whether Mr. Elliot's romantic intentions towards Anne are sincere, and whether she can bare the thought of her lost love, Captain Wentworth, marrying Miss Louisa.<br /><br />There is truly nothing that can compare to a Jane Austen romance. Her style is timeless; her plotting masterful. The characters in her books are so well-developed that they have become somewhat immortal. Fans of period pieces will NOT be disappointed. This one is not to be missed.<br /><br />Cris Cunningham for Amazon.com
1594489505|5.0|Often when an author has a tremendous first book, the \\"sophomore jinx\\" sets in and the next book cannot live up to the expectations caused by the first. Happily, Mr. Hosseini's new book is as good as, if not better than, his first. Once again we are in Afghanistan, but this time the story is told through the eyes of two women, rather than the male protagonist of the first book. We see how women were sidelined by the Taliban, and how they were virtual slaves to their husbands. It is a story of anguish, love, loss and hope for the future. I can only hope that Mr. Hosseini's future books carry on the excellent reputation he has established with these first two books.
B000M4RG42|5.0|This was a very thought-provoking piece. Extremely well played by actors previously unknown to me. The direction was spot on allowing the story to unfold with no histrionics. Gory - yes, but that's what war is. Well worth a second view. Oh yes the music was very fitting and poignant.
B00005Y1MT|5.0|I've been a prog rock fan for quite some time now and heard many concept albums from bands like Pink Floyd, Rush, Dream Theater, Genesis, Yes, etc.  But if I had to pick 1 album to listen to for the rest of my life this one would be it. It's quite dark but that's what makes the music so rich. The musicialship, especially the guitar work from Rothery is inspiring. Before I ever came across this album I placed Operation: Mindcrime at the top of my list of best concept albums. It just got knocked off.

0800177975|5.0|\\"The last action hero\\" is a puzzled fable, a movie within a movie, a smart recreation of our modern vision about the seminal concept of the hero, rescuing the essence of its meaning, spiced of clever humor that truly demands from the viewer a very detailed knowledge of certain classics of the genre.<br /><br />Jean Epstein as well as many other theorists of the cinema, have established over and over the fact to watch a movie into a dark hall surrounded of other people that barely or nothing know about, it `s very close to what we might a sensorial experience, a cathartic evasion (and sometimes a spiritual meeting, just in very reduced exceptions like Tarkovsky, Bresson, for instance). But Mac Thiernan knew to employ smartly all the available devices to convey us through this labyrinths of missed images, memories and livings immersed in those frames that run 24 times by second, because the movie occupies a place into our contemporary memory, according the level you regard it.<br /><br />Pitifully, the message was not entirely understood, due perhaps the presence of Scharwzeeger meant for many people full action without another second reading.

B0002B15WE|5.0|Die hard meant a true twist of change in what concerns the previous referential patterns about what it should be a breathtaking thriller, that blended with accurate measure, the required doses of action, suspense, around a complex and well planed terrorist attack into the same entrails of a fortified corporation, butt the presence of this refreshing action hero, who is an outlaw, and beware of this apparently simple detail: a hard fan of John Wayne who meant the most emblematic icon along seven decades in the American Cinema, remit us to many other similar situations.<br /><br />But there is much more to watch. The admirable dynamism and formidable employment of the camera as witness silent that scrutinizes and joins us through tunnels, audacious sequences and countless of adrenaline, from start to finish, spiced with some touches of sentimentalism (the dialogue between Mac Lean and the police officer), conform a formidable movie with a lot of unforgettable sequences plenty of high tension moments in which Bruce Wills signed his name with golden letters thanks among other factors the fact to elevate the dimension of an urban hero that fights in many levels, to establish the raped code of security in order to disentangle the horrid of this terrorist gang, and prove himself as hard to die police agent, capable to make the most unimaginable strategies to avoid by all his means the materialization of the pretended goal.<br /><br />Kudos too for Alan Rickman and Alexander Godunov (prematurely died after this film) who featured with admirable and crude the embodiment of the evilness and nasty repulsion for the audience.<br /><br />Since its immediate release, in 1989 I suspected and foresaw for this film the label of a contemporary cult movie category.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|We have seen several very good overviews of the 2nd world war. This one is the yardstick that we measure them by. So many people are trying to rewrite history that young people can't really understand how it was. 'World at War' and 'Victory at Sea' give the even handed history that we need today.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a down represents an interesting proposal among the tendency to search, explore and experiment with imported elements of other latitudes (as a matter of fact, there is a well deserved homage to Black Sabbath in Boom!) and the result could not be more rewarding. These guys demonstrate to have a talent far beyond we might to denominate common places, their lyrics play hard against a state of things. On the other hand the way to articulate and ensemble the songs work out as a rock suite. They play and blend with mesmerizing originality new sounds that makes us to rethink the well known cry of battle expressed so many times along so many rock festivals: Long life for the Rock& roll.
0439813786|4.0|This is a very interesting book. A teacher I work with had it and showed it to me. I ordered it and thought it was neat. The pictures are really amazing and the story isn't bad either.
0307275639|5.0|This book is powerful indeed. I shied away from it for years because I thought it would be too depressing. However, it wasn't the heartwrenching tale I expected. Some of it is comforting, a few things made me laugh, and certainly it is inspirational. I am inspired by Morrie's courage, honesty, and generous spirit. He has indeed made me rethink my priorities in life. What a great thesis.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|Of the prenatal workouts I've tried, this is definitely one of the better ones.  I'm sure I will use it a lot during this pregnancy.   Prior to my pregnancy, I worked out 6 days a week doing various activites.  I have done The Firm videos mostly for the past 1-1/2 years - but I would by no means consider myself an expert user of these videos.  I also actively walked and practiced yoga.  Just prior to finding out I was pregnant, I had begun to dabble in beginner kickboxing & pilates.  For my pregnancy, I am focused on maintaining my fitness level but I am discovering that I have to slow down a little (chalk it up to my age or that I currently chase 2 other children around).    Prenatal Fitness Fix definitely will be a great tool for this.  The workout takes place in Mrs. O'Brien's living room (or a well mimiced set).  She begins with an aerobic warmup and then moves into \\"dynamic\\" moves - push ups, squats, leg lifts, etc.  I thought I would find this a little slow given I'm used to the Firm videos, but Mrs. O'Brien moves through them quickly so it keeps your heart rate up.  It's tougher than it looks, but it was great!  Plus she utilizes items you have in your living room for the exercises - like push up leaning on the couch.  Great for those of us working out while our children nap or whatever.  She takes a few seconds between exercises to explain what is coming next.  This offers great cueing but also gives you plenty of opportunity to pause the video if needed (for a breather or bathroom break).      My only complaints about the video are the music and that she is alone for the workout.  The music is modified (mostly tempo, but in some other ways) nursery songs.  I feel I have to listen to nursery songs enough as it is with my children that I don't want to hear it during my time (my workouts).  I quickly learned to ignore it though and just pick up on the beat.  As far as her being alone for the workout - that is a personal preference of mine - I prefer an instructor interacting with other exercisers.      Overall, I would highly recommend this workout.  I felt like I actually got a workout instead of a half hour of simply moving (like most prenatal videos - please note this workout is 40 mins long).  I'm sure it will last with me through my second trimester at least.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|On 2000's comeback album, \\"Brave New World,\\" Bruce Dickinson reunited with Iron Maiden for their first studio album together since 1992. Three years later, Maiden released their 13th record, which was also their ninth with Dickinson, and their first album to feature the songwriting help of drummer Nicko McBrain. \\"Dance Of Death\\" continues in the same vein as \\"Brave New World,\\" because its songs are very long, progressive, and have an \\"epic\\" feel. These songs are, on average, over six minutes long, and several of them, including the title track, clock in at well over seven minutes. But, even though the songs never seem to drag on for too long, the album as a whole is overly long and drawn out. The only other thing holding this album back from being a masterpiece is that it has no classic songs.<br /><br />With that out of the way, there is still a lot to enjoy on \\"Dance of Death.\\" The three guitarists--Dave Murray, Janick Gers, and Adrian Smith-are all in fine form, as especially showcased when they solo (which they do on almost every song), and Bruce's voice is, of course, also in great shape. Whether crooning, digging deep, singing soulfully, or even going falsetto (which he does in \\"Montsigur\\"), Bruce's vocals are impeccable.<br /><br />The first two songs, \\"Wildest Dreams\\" and \\"Rainmaker,\\" are highlighted by rather long, mazey, winding guitar solos (plus \\"Wildest Dreams\\" also has a catchy sing along). \\"No More Lies\\" starts out slowly, like a ballad, but it eventually gains speed (with the help of punching riffs and four tasty, back-to-back solos). Other highlights are the wailing, almost careening guitars on \\"Gates of Tomorrow,\\" and the ambient closer, \\"Journeyman,\\" which backs clean, acoustic strumming with creatively-placed violins.<br /><br />It is a no-brainer that \\"Dance of Death\\" is yet another great album from these British metal legends, even if it isn't perfect. Recommended to all fans.
1591841666|4.0|This book contains some good information.  I like Seth's style, so it is very good to me.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|The movie has a lot going for it, as has been said , and said well, here and elsewhere. For myself, the movie was visually pleasing and refreshing in some ways, too, but I had some problems with what is by now esteemed a virtual classic. I am a middle-aged guy, been around, lived in several states (though not Wyoming), but I have never seen a man cry, not once in my life. In this movie the guys are always crying. They cry when they meet, they cry when they separate, they cry after they kiss, they cry after they fight. Is this believable? In the film, it is 1963 and gay or not, I just don't believe they would have gotten through life intact crying all the time. Somewhere along the way, some male figure would have put them straight on this. They seem to have gotten the message on the shame of their sexuality, is it credible that they could have survived crying their way through high school, through military service, and so on? They would have had to learn the hard way that crying would not be tolerated. This seems like a small point, but for me it is indicative of the overall anachronistic mode of the film, which looks and feels a lot like two 1980s Santa Monica gays time traveling back in the 1960s. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think they wouldn't have survived a junior high school gym class weeping and slobbering they way they do.
0812565886|4.0|Whenever I need a romantic fix, to the pages of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is where I turn. Having loved that novel so dearly, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from another Jane Austen novel. Would nothing else ever measure up or could this author surpass even her own writing genius? In this reader's eyes, neither of these extremes occurred with \\"Persuasion.\\" It most definitely had its romantic moments. Captain Wentworth's culminating profession of love to heroine Anne make that case better than I ever could: \\"You pierce my soul. I am half agony and half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. ... I have loved none but you.\\" Nonetheless, this novel and its characters still rank inferior to Mr. Darcy and Lizzy in my eyes. Not greatly so, mind you, but enough to make this merely an enjoyable read as opposed to an unforgettable one.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|Hollywood's been waiting a long time for this one. The Cold War pretty much made the Revolution a taboo subject. By the time Beatty got around to it, the proletariat had disappeared to be replaced by American college kids with trust funds and drugs arrests. Still, it is good to see this extraordinary historic event dramatized so well and performed so memorably, even if it stars Beatty playing a whiny, post-Watergate-type journalist who believed in the truth. The Bolsheviks had to put him wise on a few things. Jack Nicholson plays Eugene O'Neil, the great cynical playwright, whose marvelous performance put young Diane Keaton's silly Woody Allen impersonation in a new light. Overall, it is unique in its mainstream use of interviews to extend (pad?) the narrative. I found these interviews a real high light, especially the extended use of Henry Miller who is a hoot. Beatty never really fulfilled his promise after this stunning film. Like Costner, his seems to have had one masterpiece in him and then he shrank back to size.
0307346609|5.0|A great read!  The back and forth interview-like writing style Brooks uses gives the book a certain authenticity.  You feel as if you are reading an historical record rather than a work of fiction.  If you're a fan of apocalyptic or survival horror, pick it up, you will not be disappointed.
B000E1JOSE|4.0|I've always been a casual Orbison fan---while enjoying his radio hits, I never felt drawn to buying a whole LP. Finally, I invested in this disc, from a kind of a comeback concert televised in 1987. On it, Roy gets subtle help from a bunch of good guest artists, but the main attraction, as always, is his distinctive voice, songwriting skills, and arranging artistry. He was in good vocal shape on this occasion, and his big hits do not sound much different than the original 45-rpm singles did which began coming out more than 20 years earlier. In fact, the best performances captured here are those big hits: \\"Only the Lonely\\" and \\"Blue Bayou\\" and \\"Running Scared\\" and \\"Oh, Pretty Woman.\\" The tunes I was less familiar with, \\"Leah\\" and \\"The Comedians\\" for instance, I found much less interesting. If you, like me, know that Roy had come a long way from Wink, Texas through Clovis, NM and Memphis, TN to superstardom, and you wanted him represented in the music that reflects your younger days, this is as good a choice as any. (Although I was a kid in Jersey when Roy had his first hit single, I now live halfway between his boyhood home in Wink and the site of his first recordings (not hits) at Norman Petty's studio in Clovis. Roy's initial success came from his association at Sun Records in Memphis, however, which must have seemed like a grand metropolis to the geeky looking kid from Wink.)
B000P2A24W|5.0|I am a fan and love everything this band does...but this CD is one of the best. It has a country flare, but is all Bon Jovi. There is not one song on this disk that I do not like. Can't wait to see the tour!
0316018953|4.0|I wish I had paid more attention to the title of this book, since I read it in serial form in the New York Times.  Since I am an inveterate Bosch fan, I buy anything Connelly writes!  I think its serialization should have been noted in the advertising blurb; had it been, I would not have spent the money on the hardback.
0618680004|5.0|In my opinion, no treaties for reason have yet bested Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\", but this book comes darn close.    Dawkins uses incredible restraint in deconstructing the origins and motives of religious movements, down to rightly acknowledging the fact that indoctrination of babies and young children is a form of child abuse, psychologically tethering young minds to torturous fantasy notions of eternal pain and suffering for failure to obey the ever shifting and politically convenient translation of ancient scriptures.  I would gladly share this book with friends and family who are believers, because I feel that it is written in a conversational and respectful manner.  The fact that many disagree (read the negative reviews - the majority of which were written by people who didn't bother to read the book) illustrates the special treatment that religious belief enjoys in our culture - a of wall of silence masquerading as tolerance.   Dawkins is unafraid to call a spade a spade, and covers all of his bases with thorough arguments and scientific explanations of what is known about the material world (and some of our immaterial reflections and perceptions of it, along with some of their likely origins).  I feel this is a book that should be read by anyone interested in the subject of religion, from within or without.  I wish I had this book when I was 12 - it would have saved me from a feeling of isolation I had as a non-believer.    Fear of isolation and alienation are the motivation for so many 'believers' to drink their kool aid like good little followers, believing in anything and everything their tin leaders push on them - this book serves as a much needed antidote.
0385522401|4.0|In elegant, spare prose, McEwan evokes the naivete of a less permissive  time and the catastrophic misunderstanding that can result when two people   have neither the experience nor the language to even open a discussion on  sexual intimacy, regardless of the authenticity of their love for each other.  It's a poignant, haunting story I read with a sense of dread.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|This set was one of my daughter's birthday presents and I was sweating the arrival time of the package....much to my relief, the order arrived in no time!!
0345494768|5.0|This is book is AMAZING. I did not expect the level of detail here. Every part of the process of how Star Wars came to be is examined, from the evolution of the script, to concept art, the formation of ILM, casting, filming, post-production etc. You get a lot of information that even the hardcore SW fans may not have known.  You also get to know young George Lucas but all the people who were involved in the making of the original classic. The many men and women who contributed to bringing this movie to movie screens on May 25 1977.     BTW don't believe Dave from Washington when he says in his 4 out of 7 review that they barely mention the deletion of the Biggs and Luke scene at Toschi Station. They go over it pretty clearly. Lucas' friends, filmmakers Hal Barwood and Mathew Robbins suggest that he put the scene in the script, Lucas shoots it when they're in Tunisia and later while they're working on the rough cut, editor Paul Hirsch gives valid reasons why the scene should be cut out of the movie.     Anyway, this is a great book that also entertains and manages to transport you to that incredible time thirty years ago!
0823016714|4.0|i thought the book was something different from what i ordered.  but i guess its good for artists
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I've been a pretty hardcore LP fan since the beginning and had been highly anticipating their next CD.  However, I did purchase this album with some temerity because of the reviews it was receiving and the description of the new songs, particularly by the band themself.  I think the album is ok - not exactly my musical style, but not unexpected either.  It is good to see the band has grown some and is expanding their horizons to show their growth - really, who wants another album with more of the same stuff, even if it is LP.  The songs are decent and are still LP-ish.  However, being someone who likes the heavier music, this didn't quite meet my tastes and I won't be adding it to my MP3 player or carrying the CD around in my car.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|[from Masterpiece Theatre, 2006]  Eyre : I'm sorry sir, I did not ask permission to read the books.  Rochester : (to the effect) You don't need to ask permission Jane . . after all, you're a thinking person . . blah-bi-di-blah-blah-blah    Yeah.    This adaptation is mined with expositive anvils. It's not for anyone accustomed to the gifted authors who are *masters* of language, that have dominated American cable in recent years. In that respect it's oddly out of it's time. Which is a shame because the camera work and overall production values are great and Ruth Wilson is terrific; heartfelt and sympathetic... but that's about as far as it goes. Which isn't her fault.  She is hampered by shoddy writing and comparatively light weight conflict.    Somewhere along the line, someone got the bright idea that Stephens -- who does an awful lot of smirking and frowning here -- should play Rochester like he never really means the coarse  . . . no, actually Brontë's coarseness is largely removed from this version . . . maybe *objectionable* is a better word . . yeah *objectionable,* things he's says, almost apologizing for them. Signaling to the audience, not to be alarmed, this really is a romantic, good-guy.    But that's only partly true.    In Brontë's  book, Rochester is a manic, indulged, game playing, liar. Sure he's *really* besotted with the governess, and has a looney wife in the tower, all of which creates a lot of stress. But how many men would play out their sexual/romantic pursuit in this twisted, convoluted way?  His eccentricities, changeable moods and ethical elasticity are also part of his *character,* and provide much of the dark, quirky menace and mystery that drive the story. Both for us and for Jane.  The reasons *why*, can never be completely answered.    It seems this last point did not sit well with writer Sandy Welch, who sets about scrubbing away any trace of dirt and ambiguity from Edward's character, by creating scenes so ham-fisted, it's virtually impossible to imagine Brontë wrote them. Example: a haughty house guest accuses him of too much compassion., explaining *she's* not bothered by the fact that some people are born rich and others poor. To which Rochester frowns disapprovingly, and declares the conversation tiresome.  In fact, at the point we meet Rochester he's long abandoned philanthropic notions in favor of dallying in \\"sensual pleasure,\\" (a conversation absent in this version.) He even calls Jane out for calling him on it. But even if you decide Rochester has since become more politically correct (Welsh's assertion not Brontë's), is it wise to pointedly cue in the audience at this stage in the story? To a similar effect, Welsh invents a Ouija board scene where Rochester manipulates the board so Blanche spells out the word \\"h-e-a-r-t-l-e-s-s.\\"     And what she *doesn't* invent is not much better. In this version, Rochester hires a gypsy to play the fortune teller.  Upon discovery, he flat-out tells Jane, he just wanted to know what she was thinking, then they both make fun of the house guests.  Why bother contriving all that, if he had no problem spilling the beans anyway? Then after coming off a wonderful moment of indignance at being prompted to \\"talk nonsense,\\" Wilson's Jane must now appear dense, unable to decipher Edward's obvious adoration of her.    And nowhere in *any* of this, is there any seeming awareness that only a perverse mind would engage in such play to begin with.      And so on... his relationship with Adele is handled much the same way.     The results are an Edward so sanitized and transparent, it seriously reduces the conflict and character contrast in the story, flattening the dynamic. We're also left with a much less interesting character, if not a confusing one.  And without the risk, his contrast to St. John Rivers, and the meaning of Jane's decision to return to Thornfield, is oversimplified.    There's also far less testing of the waters, during the 1st interviews,and toe-to-toe challenge which is not incidental to the story.  In fact it's the hinge on which their relationship builds and an important facet that makes *these* characters unique.    I will admit the proposal scene (one of the best in this version) had a lot of life to it and Stephens was at his best here. But at points even the changed dialogue landed awkward, and after building to the kiss, he lands one . . . right at the *side* of her mouth.    As others mentioned, the Gateshead-Lowood years are inexplicably truncated. Though artfully done they are unsubstantial in providing the grim context. This includes child abuse in the shape of beatings, humiliation, unfounded accusations and a relentless barrage of damning judgment, aimed at breaking the spirit of orphaned youths . . . in the guise of saving their souls. At times Wilson's gravitas compensate for these deficiencies, but that can only stretch so far.    This adaptation is also light on stricture -- either her adherence to or questioning of it, as well as her consuming struggle with conscience; her attempts to weigh what she has been taught, against what she is learning.    And please no purist finger pointing, I firmly believe one can create too faithful an adaptation of a 500 page novel. But in the end you have to at least make choices that are consistent with the tone, along with other components that define a story.    Otherwise cliches are used to punch up the romantic angle, such as back lighting during the \\"after the fire\\" scene, creating dreamy silhouettes that are more evocative of the sweet discoveries in \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" than the dangerous sexuality in \\"Jane Eyre.\\"    Elsewhere in this version St. John, upon discovering the exhausted Jane, *gracefully* stretched out on a rock, simply lifts her up and carries her to safety.    The '83 adaptation (which I discovered only recently) on the other hand, though flawed, does not omit the dirty bits. There, after weakened, dejected Jane (Zelah Clarke) tries to trade her gloves for a-day-old biscuit; she is shamed and thrown out of the bakery. She winds up shoveling gruel into her mouth, meant for pigs, with her bare fingers. Then starved, frozen and delirious, she bangs on a door during a storm.  In tears she yells incoherently at the housekeeper, who turns her away. After which St. John finds her.    There is nothing graceful or visually appealing about *this* picture. The consequences are clear. Jane has fallen a lot further down  through knowing Mr. Rochester, the man she pledged her heart to.    Pluses against minuses, I'd recommend the '83 adaptation. Be warned the production values are weak, the occasional scoring abominable, the camera work unimaginative and a few scenes needed to be reworked, even after good starts (but ONLY a few.)  Likely due to time constraints and/or momentary directorial assy-ness. Which is forgivable. This one probably had the lowest budget per hour.    Still THAT one, which DOES use much of Brontë's  gutsier language, tells THIS particular story much better. Timothy Dalton is walking thunder and provides an edgy pulse that is decidedly Brontë. However while giving a bigger performance, he is overall, less mannered, and seemingly more relaxed in the vagaries of Edward's skin. He relishes the games, embracing the darkness and duality of this character, rather than apologizing for it. Yet his tender moments are both real and surprising, and genuinely rewarding.    Given that the BBC/MT has, in recent years, produced gritty works involving female protagonists like, \\"The Virgin Queen\\" and \\"The Final Act,\\" without flinching, this bloodless, patronizing, girly-girl treatment of \\"Eyre\\" is puzzling and very disappointing. Next time they feel the itch to give Brontë the Austen treatment, I hope they'll come to their senses and hand the project over to HBO, where they're under no obligation to tamper with essentials. Call me a cynic but I think economic  concerns trumped artistic ones, due to an avalanche of competitors jockeying for airtime and dvd sales.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I've titled this with a chaotic sentence referencing several different sports.  I think it is appropriate because of the virtuostic gymnastics going on instrumentally in this release.    Dream Theater has released a phenomenal album musically, although at first I wasn't sold on the dark lyrical content. When taken from a metal/fantasy point of view, however all is roses.    Musically there are elements of some of their past work, but mostly they are continuing to evolve their sound rather than looking to far into the past.  Is it the best work of their career?  I can't really say, but it is one of my favorites along with Scenes and Six Degrees.  On the other hand I have loved all of their releases on first listen...except for Train of Thought and Awake.  Those two took a little longer to grow on me, but I now really love them as well.      Favorite tracks on this disc are Dark Eternal Night and Ministry of Lost Souls.    Bottom line:  Buy it now....and definately get the special edition.  The DVD bonus disc is enlightening, and the 5.1 mix of the songs sounds great.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Okay, that's probably the title used by half the reviewers but i haven't read any of them yet :o)    Series One is fantaboulous- Christopher Eccleston as the Nith Doctor really sucked me into the show. The really lucked out getting him, and Billie Piper's not bad, either!    Great buy, highly recommeded. My kid's love it too and they're aged 4.5 and 7.5
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The series is very informative and entertaining, but it also serves as the perfect demo disc to show off the \\"Blu-Ray Experience\\".
B000GRUS22|5.0|Enigma has a great pro: Takes its escence of its music, while blends it with fresh beats and sounds. This work shows great traces of soft and aggresive electronica blended with an \\"outer space\\" atmosphere. When I listened to the CD, I felt taken to somewhere next to the moon, looking at the stars and the Earth in front (possibly most of the track titles would push me into that thought). Enigma evolved for the good through time, and this is the product. Song like \\"Good bye Milky Way\\", \\"Dreaming of Andromeda\\" and \\"Northen Lights\\" would relax yourself and feel great emotions; while \\"Dancing with Mephisto\\" and \\"Feel me Heaven\\", would give you a great blast with a little more agrresive electronica and faster beats. Something I would have prefered is a different picture for the CD cover, I think I would be great a great space picture of a nebula, the Pleyades, a supernova or something; but anyways, after listening to this, that will be the last thing you might be thinking about. Great job Michael!
1594489505|1.0|I read this book and loved it, but I then read \\"MY FORBIDDEN FACE\\" by Latifa, published in 2001 - six years BEFORE Khaled Hosseini's latest offering. The similarities between these books are too striking to be ignored.    Both focus on a teen-aged Afghan girl living under the terror of the Taliban, her mother is mentally unable to cope with this life so the girl relies on her father, in both books the girl has two brothers and she lives in Kabul, both books discuss the Titanic movie crazy, the abscense of boys flying kites, and the list goes on and on.     If you have read A Thousand Splendid Suns, then read My Forbidden Face and make up your own mind. Seeing the similarities brought down Khaled Hosseini's work in my mind. At best it is unoriginal and at worst it is a copy cat.
006056251X|3.0|Lisa Kleypas is an extraordinary and accomplished writer and it shows in her work. But perhaps my expectation was too high, because in the end, I was a disappointed with St. Vincent and Evie's story.<br /><br />I liked the story of Evie and St. Vincent well enough,<br />I was looking for some excitement, some danger; considering St. Vincent's shady, cynical, mysterious nature, I was hoping there's be a dark edge to his love story with Evie. But there was none. Half the time he was NURTURING Evie, TAKING CARE of her, SEEING TO HER NEEDS, and thus, acting more her father than her lover. Save for his occasional sexual remarks/threats towards Evie and the embraces (which were too few and often unsatisfying), there was little tension between them... as far as I could tell.<br /><br />As it was, the set up for the story was engaging enough. The first 2 chapter had me fairly bristling with excitement. I couldn't wait to read on. But it just went down hill from there. The next few chapters just dragged on and on. The long, tedious ride to Gretna Green really killed the romance and any sexual tension between the two couple. For most of the journey, the couple was exhausted and travel-weary. Here're some quotes from the book for you:<br /><br />-\\"On and on and on... the carriage bounced on the rough patches of road, at times nearly pitching Evie from the seat to the floor.\\"<br /><br />-\\"Well-sprung and equipped though the carriage was, traveling at such relentless speed caused the vehicle to jolt and sway until Evie began to feel nauseated. She was exhausted and could find no comfortable position in which to sleep. Her head bumped constantly against the wall... St. Vincent was less obviously miserable than Evie, though he too has acquired a rumpled, travel-worn appearance.\\"<br /><br />Wow... how romantic...<br />Think about it, when you have to sit in one place over a long period of time, cramped up in a little space, while the carriage rocked and jarred itself down the lengthy road, you'd be in no mood for any romance. And that is exactly what happened. Evie became \\"comfortable\\" in St. Vincent's company, even allowing him to cuddle up to her, because frankly she is too tired to care. She even commented on this at one point. The result: there was no excitement, no heated gazes, little conversation, and no tension between the couple.<br /><br />As far as the rest of the story goes...eh. More than anything, I find St. Vincent's attitude towards Evie a little disturbing. While I like the occasional show of possessiveness and protectiveness in a hero, I found St. Vincent's behavior to be controlling and condescending. Putting it bluntly, he is a control freak. Not what I wanted for Evie. In light of her childhood, she needed someone who'd let make her own decisions, not attempt to control her with threats. What's the deal with St. Vincent having her stalked by the servants so they can report back to him on her daily whereabouts, when she eats, what she ate, how much, who she met with. Please! She is a grown woman. Not a child. She doesn't need to be told when and what to eat as if she was 5 years old. Once again, he acts more the father than the lover. In today's society, he's the type of man I'd warn my friends away from.<br /><br />Another things I didn't like about this book is the individual character development. Throughout the novel, I just couldn't relate to or sympathize with either Evie or St. Vincent. The inconsistency really bothered me. Is Evie the shy, timid, damsel in distress, or does she possess inner strength? Sometimes she lets St. Vincent browbeat her into compliance and sometime she stands up to him. Her plight confuses me. She's 22 years old, so why is her still under the control of her uncles? And why didn't she go to her friends for help, but instead sought out the man who kidnapped one of her best friends? She knew nothing of him and what she does know doesn't inspire much trust. Logically speaking, her decision to seek St. Vincent's help was pure stupidity. Marrying him shouldn't afford her anymore protection than seeking her friends for help, because she is act an age where she is no longer under the legal control of her uncles. Whatever she does, Evie fails to inspire admiration in me. She doesn't stand out as a heroine. She lack personality: a distinguishing characteristic which makes her stand out from other females and explains why the hero suddenly finds her so irresistible. I don't get it.  Maybe it's just me.<br /><br />And as for St. Vincent... I really don't get why he is so cynical and jaded. Usually, there's a good reason why the hero sees the world so negatively. Either he was betrayed by a loved one, or he was abused as a child, or he needed to be bad so that he could survive in the world. But none of this is true for St. Vincent. He didn't grow up poor. He lived in luxury (if you ask me, he was more than a little spoiled). The only problems he faced in the past was that his father was neglectful and that he's lost his sisters to an illness at a young age. Not to be mean, but... so? This doesn't justify his cynicism. Doesn't justify why he lacked enough moral to betray his best friend and abduct his fianc&eacute;. The fact that he would never have raped Lillian doesn't redeem him, though Evie sure felt otherwise. I've read of heroes who've gone through much worse and turned out much more of a man than St. Vincent could ever be. His best friend, Marcus Westcliffe, for instance, was tortured and beaten by his father, cut off from his sisters, neglected by his mother, and mercilessly disciplined ever since he was a babe... and he is no where near as cynical and jaded as St. Vincent is described to be. Despite his abuse, Westcliffe grew up to be a well-rounded, responsible, caring man... while St. Vincent simply wallows in luxury and women. He doesn't have responsibilities, doesn't have to answer to anyone, and up until he arrived at Jenner's Gaming Hell, he's had no job. Now suddenly, he's a workaholic? Highly unbelievable... The idea of comparing this spoiled, self-centered playboy to my hero Derek Craven kinda offends me... sorry to be blunt.<br /><br />Ironically, I found Marcus Westcliff's story (It Happened One Autumn) to be much more thrilling than St. Vincent's. What a surprise that turned out to be since Westcliffe is the supposed arrogant, straightlaced, aristocratic type. Yet his story turned out much more engaging and entertaining. A pity...<br /><br />In the end, it was a good enough book, but far from deserving of 5 stars.ouldn't afford her anymore protection than seeking her friends for help, because she is act an age where she is no longer under the legal control of her uncles.

B000002LRX|5.0|There is something about this album that is able to uproot the listener and emerse them in a listening experience that is skilled and varied. This album is not for everyone, maybe not for most people even. But this is one of those albums that takes me back to my youth because it did such a good job imprinting on me. I love it. - if you like \\"good music\\" and are able to transverse genres, check it out. No matter what your taste, you'll have to give props to a band that put alot of thought into what they delivered as a whole.
B00005JNJV|5.0|One of the biggest surprises in cinema that said year, `Batman Begins' proves to be everything one could ask for in a superhero movie.  It's got some breathtaking action scenes, some great fight scenes and some amazing special effects.  What takes this film over the edge though, making it far removed from the previous efforts is that the script is tight, the acting is superb and the characters are so well fleshed out that they become three dimensional.  We, the audience, feel like we know Bruce Wayne inside and out and we understand where he's coming from.  We don't get that feeling from the previous films.  Christian Bale does such a brilliant job with his character that I'm tempted to say he was snubbed come awards season.  He truly did deserve some recognition for his work here.  He took a character that has been played before with no real depth and transformed him into someone we could relate to and cheer for.  He did for Batman what Daniel Craig did for James Bond.<br /><br />The film may start on the slow side of things as has been commented on before.  It's a general retelling of The Dark Knights origin so it's bound to be a lot of story telling versus an over abundance of action.  The action does come, just not right away.  I actually enjoyed watching Wayne's story slowly unfold.  It's very interesting to see where he got his start since the concept has not been pursued in any of the Batman films before this one.  The film explores the training Wayne undergoes after his parents are murdered and he flees the country.  Upon returning some years later to a city overrun by criminals Wayne makes it his personal agenda to rid Gotham City of the waste and filth that permeates the streets.  After returning though, and donning the cape, Bruce finds that struggling to keep a firm grasp on his two personas may be his biggest challenge.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, Bale does a fantastic job with tackling both Bruce Wayne and Batman, two separate characters who both need delicate attention.  He's cocky and self-sure, doubtful and reserved, distant and egotistical, responsible and afraid, all of these things and sometimes all at once, and he handles his emotions so effortlessly he completely sinks into his character and becomes the Bat.  Another standout performance comes from rising star Cillian Murphy who devours his role as Jonathan Crane or better known as `The Scarecrow'.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|It has a nice political plot and I enjoyed that the woman are not \\"second class\\" to men. They don't have the aura that the man is totally in control, the woman is also in control too.  Mkay...politics, it wasn't too confusing, well actually it isn't at all. It's has a nice political plot and it isn't lame. It goes well with the story.   The action is fantastic. The guys do look a bit fake, but the killing is just too much \\"fun\\" to watch. The \\"blood\\" is amazing and how they cut the body parts up and all. Their wall which is made of dead people is interesting...  In the end, it's a great movie that you just have to watch in the future.
B00000K31Q|5.0|One of my favorite teen comedies would have to be '10 Things I Hate About You', a film that remains hilarious and smart as each year passes.  The dialog is snappy and sincere and the acting is really top notch for a teen film, every actor in perfect unison and really in tune with their character.  As far as modern adaptations of Shakespearian novels go (and there are tons of them as we are all well aware) this is one of the better ones.  It stays true to the concept of the original `Taming of the Shrew' but adds enough clever twists that make this original and a lot of fun.  The chemistry between the actors is wonderful, and for a film staring a group of young actors it's one of the only films to star a group of `talented' young actors, from recent Oscar nominee Heath Ledger to Oscar snubbed Joseph Gordon-Levitt.<br /><br />The plot of the film follows Cameron, played by Gordon-Levitt, as he pines for the attention of Bianca, played by Larisa Oleynik.  The problem Cameron faces is not the fact that she's one of the most popular girls in school, and way out of his league but the fact that her father refuses to let her date.  His stipulation is that her older sister Kat begin dating first, and Kat is not about to do that anytime soon.  Cameron decides his only option is to find a suitor for Kat, someone to sweep her off her feet, problem being that everyone at the school is afraid of Kat.  She's abrasive, rude and has made it perfectly clear that she has no interest in boys.  But Cameron finds Patrick Verona, the mysterious tough guy with no fears, and offers him cash to take out Kat.  Thus the hunt begins.  Patrick finds it more difficult than expected to woo Kat but as he attempts he finds that his original disinterest in her is turning to genuine infatuation and then to a more mature caring and concern.  He's falling in love with her and surprisingly she's falling for him as well.<br /><br />All four of the main stars work wonders with their characters.  Oleynik is sweet, funny and realistic as Bianca.  I remember watching her on Nickelodeon's `The Secret World of Alex Mack' and thinking she had that natural talent, of course I was twelve but whatever.  Here she doesn't disappoint, even now that I'm much older than twelve.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great here, really natural.  He's matured into such a wonderful actor and his selection in films is wonderfully eclectic.  Julia Stiles also blew me away here.  I've always been a fan of her acting, she's charming and beautiful to look at, but her she shows layers of depth and reality to a character that could have easily become surface in the hands of another actress.  She truly deserves a better career than the one she has.  And talking about better careers, look no further than the standout performer of the bunch Heath Ledger.  Before `Brokeback Mountain' he was the one to watch for.  Here he's charming, natural, charismatic, funny and definitely ahead of the pack as far as natural talent is concerned.  I'm so proud of him as an actor.<br /><br />The supporting players are all great as well, from Larry Miller who plays the girls paranoid father (that whole scene with the pregnant crack addict story is priceless) to Allison Janney who plays the sex obsessed guidance councilor, everyone is on the top of their game.  But ultimately this is a teen movie, about and for teens and so I need to make mention of the supporting actors playing teens (I say `playing' because I'm sure most of them are in their twenties/thirties as is almost always the case).  David Khumoltz is effective in the geeky sidekick role, but it's Andrew Keegan who shines as popular, too cool for his own good, cocky jerk Joey.  He's utterly hilarious in his role which could have gone the route of stock character but instead stepped out from the pack and became a very memorable part of the film.  That whole scene with the two pictures was genius.  With a tight script and an effective cast '10 Things I Hate About You' should prove to be an enjoyable movie experience, one for the textbooks!oyable movie experience, one for the textbooks!
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Well worth the steep price, if you love the original Star Trek series.  Hours and hours of great memories on DVD!  Presented in the order they were shown on TV, but numbered according to the order in which they were PRODUCED -- if you want to see them in \\"stardate\\" order, just look for the next number (may involve changing discs).  We're enjoying this series AGAIN, and we're raising a new generation of Kirk/Spock/Bones/Scotty fans.

B000002UW1|4.0|After years of being virtually unknown away from the indie/college scene, R.E.M. makes a break for the pros thanks to commercial breakthroughs like \\"The One I Love\\" and \\"It's the End of the World As We Know It.\\" And unlike their next album, these hits were actually pretty darn good! This is an eclectic R.E.M. at their best; consistency in sound and mood reigns over their other great albums, but this one feels thrown together with purpose and sense. It also continues the progression towards a clearer, richer production that started with Pageant; too bad the overall quality can't match the previous record.     Because this effort does a good job of straddling their indie and popular phases, this is a good entry point for R.E.M. starters (along with Automatic). No one said that message songs need to be drab and somnolent, but is the goofy pop hook on \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" really the best choice? And thus is the quarrel with Document: it's already pushing for the slick sound when the music would be better suited with an edge. Despite the hiccups, there are several quality moments here, and still a good choice for fans and newbies alike. \\"Disturbance At the Heron House,\\" \\"King of Birds,\\" and the aforementioned hits are the best bets.    Best cuts: \\"The One I Love,\\" \\"Disturbance At the Heron House,\\" \\"It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine),\\" \\"King of Birds,\\" \\"Finest Worksong,\\" \\"Strange,\\" \\"Welcome to the Occupation,\\" \\"Lightnin' Hopkins\\"
0385339682|3.0|The Last Juror  John Grisham    The Last Juror is a fun read if somewhat tedious at times.  The supposed plot is a man convicted of rape and murder threatens the jury.  After ten years in prison the man is paroled and jurors begin to die.  At least that is what the book jacket says.  In reality it is a first person narrative about a young liberal who buys a defunct newspaper in a small southern community.  Like many of Grisham's \\"hero's he is the perfect little liberal.  He is against the war (Vietnam in this one), he hates the dollar store, and above all he has to do everything possible to help the black community.  While some may find these qualities admirable, after a while they can get a little old.    In this town the only intelligent people are our liberal hero and a middle aged African-American woman.  In fact the crime and the surrounding story is only a sub-plot for these two characters to walk around in.  One gets the impression that it all gets in the way.  Not to give away to much of the ending, but the title of the book makes no sense.  At the end, more than one juror is left.    If you are interested in a fast pace crime novel, then pass this by.  If you are interested in a young liberal's view of experiences that young liberals would like to have, then this is the book for you.
B00006F7S4|4.0|After the half-joking, intentionally overblown crunchy junkyard funk of Midnite Vultures, Beck returns to folksy roots rock on Sea Change. One immediately thinks reinvention, but this is really only two or three degrees removed from his on-the-quick Mutations record. If you came for fuzzy rockers like \\"Devil's Haircut\\" or the sort of dancey beats he honed on \\"Mixed Bizness,\\" look elsewhere. Beck is at his most world-weary and despondent here, like a romanticized paean floating through melancholy folk and sadsack blues. If you're looking to party, stick with Odelay or Vultures (or even Mellow Gold), but that doesn't mean that this is a bad record. If for nothing else, Sea Change is his most reliable record since Mellow--there are no failures or mistakes (even his near-masterpiece Odelay had a couple of those).     Start to finish, it finds a sound and rolls along its gentle, mournful waves all the way to the finish. But there are few bright spots (and not just in an emotional sense). \\"Lonesome Tears\\" has a heart-tearing rush and sonic building conclusion, \\"The Golden Age\\" floats by like a darkening cloud, and \\"Lost Cause\\" is a gorgeously desperate plea (which, like many songs on here, is aimed at one or more of his former celebrity significant others). Few others are worth remembering--always listenable, but rarely exemplary--but the album as a whole deserves to be spun at least a couple of times.    Best cuts: \\"Lost Cause,\\" \\"Lonesome Tears,\\" \\"The Golden Age,\\" \\"Round the Bend,\\" \\"Sunday Sun,\\" \\"Little One,\\" \\"Paper Tiger,\\" \\"End of the Day\\"

B000002MG1|4.0|For all the angst and harrowing depression that seemed to be the vogue of the time, few tried making it as soft and beautiful as the arrangements found on Automatic For the People. Several of these tracks are quite affecting even after multiple listens and even the overplayed hit, \\"Everybody Hurts,\\" is good in small doses. \\"Man on the Moon\\" is one of their all-time best tunes, \\"Drive\\" a fabulous opener, and \\"Nightswimming\\" one of their most underappreciated singles.     One must wonder how much credit is due to John Paul Jones, who does the strings on several songs, but consider this something of a comeback for R.E.M. after their last two limp efforts--sadly, the comeback would NOT last. A bit overrated (some call it the band's best album), but still a very solid effort all around, and the last R.E.M. album worth picking up for anyone except hardcore fans.    Best cuts: \\"Man on the Moon,\\" \\"Nightswimming,\\" \\"Drive,\\" \\"Try Not to Breathe,\\" \\"Sweetness Follows,\\" \\"Everybody Hurts,\\" \\"Find the River,\\" \\"Monty Got a Raw Deal\\"
1594489505|4.0|A very good story...although the background of Afghanistan and the circumstances of the people are depressing. It certainly makes a person feel blessed in their own situation. It's the story of two women struggling with existence and the impact they have on each other.
B000002MU3|2.0|Widely derided R.E.M. album seems to find them trying to shape their sound towards grunge and glam by increasing the distortion and then shining it to a clean sounding reverb. While it's not quite the disaster that some claim, this certainly isn't essential R.E.M.     The frequently rotated MTV hit, \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" is good enough, I suppose, but after the recent \\"Losing My Religion\\" and \\"Man on the Moon,\\" it certainly isn't a good enough tentpole to warrant interest in the rest of this weird little creation. I realize that the band likes to take chances and try new sounds for each album, but no sane person could even recognize the 80s form of R.E.M. in \\"King of Comedy.\\"     At times, it nears the same sort of unexpected success that U2 found when they made Pop (not the band we all knew and liked, but still something different and pretty good), but the whole thing is really just a big mess. In the shuffle, though, there's treasure to be made of the trash. \\"Tongue\\" and \\"Bang and Blame\\" are especially warped little winners, and make up for the disasters that are \\"Circus Envy\\" and the aforementioned \\"King.\\" Also, doesn't \\"Strange Currencies\\" have almost the exact same beat as \\"Everybody Hurts\\"?    Best cuts: \\"Bang and Blame,\\" \\"Tongue,\\" \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream,\\" \\"Crush With Eyeliner,\\" \\"Let Me In,\\" \\"Star 69\\"
B000669GAI|5.0|This IS the early 90s sound. Between Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Sonic Youth grunge would never have made it. A great CD for any collection
B000002UVZ|4.0|After listeners struggled to hear Michael Stipe's words on their first three albums (an intentional mixing decision), suddenly everything he had to say was crystal clear...well, not counting the frequently cryptic messages. But the passages and songs with the clearest purposes prove to be something of a mistake. What little there is to clearly comprehend is often heavy-handed, even preachy at times. Despite good intentions on environmentalism, does anyone want to listen to a college radio hero standing on a soapbox?     Maybe that's one of the reasons why Lifes Rich Pageant is one of R.E.M.'s most forgotten records (despite selling better than their first three albums). Another could be a dearth of popular tunes, but then again, the harder-rocking power pop of songs like \\"Begin the Begin\\" and \\"Superman\\" seem perfectly adjusted to the waves of radio America. Can this album match their first two efforts of the decade? Not quite. Should it be rediscovered by a generation that knows R.E.M. mostly by \\"Losing My Religion\\" and \\"Everybody Hurts\\"? Definitely.     Best cuts: \\"Begin the Begin,\\" \\"Fall on Me,\\" \\"I Believe,\\" \\"Superman,\\" \\"The Flowers of Guatemala,\\" \\"What If We Give It Away,\\" \\"Swan Swan H,\\" \\"Cuyahoga,\\" \\"Just a Touch\\"
B0002IQMKM|4.0|This collection is all a Talking Head fan (except the most devout fan) will ever need. 3/4s of the tunes are great, the rest are still good.
B000HIVO64|3.0|Disappointing Beck album has a spare electronic feel to most of it that frequently offers solid grooves, unexpected flourishes, and the always cryptic lyrical stylings we're accustomed to, but few standouts. Considering how fast it followed on the heels of Guero (and the re-mix album, Guerolito), one could be forgiven for thinking this was just a hastily thrown together B-side collection; most of these songs sound like leftovers unworthy of appearing on a true Beck album.     Energy wanes at several junctures, and it's not much of a surprise that the best songs are the ones that are more immediately satisfying (the bouncy \\"Nausea,\\" the shiny \\"Think I'm in Love,\\" and the stark and powerful \\"New Round\\"). His forays towards hip-hop usually make up the weakest segments, such as the noisy and overstuffed \\"1000BPM\\" and the uneven \\"We Dance Alone.\\" But even at its worst, it's still Beck, and he's forgiven for his failures simply because he's willing to take the chance.     Side note: did they forget to promote this? I heard about Guero dozens of times up to its release, but then I just happen upon this completely by accident about two days after it came out!    Best cuts: \\"Nausea,\\" \\"Think I'm in Love,\\" \\"New Round,\\" \\"Elevator Music,\\" \\"No Complaints,\\" \\"Movie Theme,\\" \\"Strange Apparition,\\" \\"Motorcade\\"
B00000J7JO|5.0|Just a flat out great CD. More good songs per CD than most, even more than some \\"greatest hits\\" CDs. I has good songs you know and the ones you don't know will soon become favorities.
B000AL730O|4.0|With producer Nigel Godrich (a frequent Radiohead collaborator) helping out, Paul's latest effort may seem to reek of a desperation to connect with the hip, young crowd. In fact, Godrich seems to be on hand to make sense of the rougher impulses in McCartney's solo oeuvre, streamlining the mess into cohesion. Chaos and Creation is Paul's best and most consistent album since...well, ever.     Granted, I've heard less McCartney records than ones I haven't, but the general consensus suggests that the ones I've heard were the better ones. Although Paul had the most successful music career of the Beatles after the break-up, he's never hovered in the same league as Lennon or Harrison. But with this album, he proves that he may have been capable of crafting true albums all along; all he had to do, it seems, is just get away from those silly love songs. Even the songs that ring of the alarms of filler warning (\\"English Tea\\" especially) are pleasant and catchy enough not to make one feel the itch to reach for the skip button. The gentle lilt of \\"A Certain Softness\\" is an obvious highlight, as are the drawn out sprawls of \\"How Kind of You\\" and \\"Riding to Vanity Fair,\\" and the zippy leadoff, \\"Fine Line.\\" The album's often spare beauty is its greatest asset; don't expect it to grip you immediately, but it has better replay value than anything McCartney's done since his Beatles days.    Best cuts: \\"A Certain Softness,\\" \\"This Never Happened Before,\\" \\"Fine Line,\\" \\"Riding to Vanity Fair,\\" \\"At the Mercy,\\" \\"How Kind of You,\\" \\"Jenny Wren,\\" \\"Anyway,\\" \\"Too Much Rain,\\" \\"Promise to You Girl\\"
B000003TAL|5.0|Yeh this album may take a while to get into for some but stick with it, it is well worth the wait.  For me though I have to say teenage riot just hooked me from the off great track with a beautiful slow build up. This album doesnt realy hit you straight off but rather gets you by supprise.  Realy dont know how I can describe this album as you can hear so many influences coming through from Black Flag to the Velvet Underground.<br /><br />Buy this and give it a listen, then listen again.  It will grow on you.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|When I first heard about this documentary, I just heard about some of the more sensational items (lions teaming up to kill an elephant, baboons practing cannibalism against competing tribe), and thought this was one of that new generation of animal \\"snuff\\" films. However, taken in context of 10.5 hours of the whole series, it doesn't seem out of place or sensationalistic at all.    My parents bought this for me and my family to watch when they came to visit us in Germany, as they know our 2 children (6 and 9), love animals. However, it was great for the whole family. It is a visual treat, and some of the scenes displayed are amazing, both for the impressive cinematography as well as the rareness of the event being captured. My daughters laughed hysterically at the bizarre mating dances of various birds of paradise.    There are 11 different episodes, which cover every aspect of the Earth, from the arctic Poles to the deep ocean. There are of course favorites like the Great Plains and Jungles, but what's amazing is how interesting even segments like the Desert or Caves can be when treated so skillfully. My only minor complaint is that Sigourney Weaver's narration seemed a little flat, and got old to me after a while. This is undoubtedly a subjective thing.    This was probably the most amazing nature documentary I have ever seen, and I came away with much more of an appreciation of the abundant varieties of life we have on this planet. I would think almost everyone would enjoy this.

0790729725|5.0|What a movie!  That's all i can say after seeing what I believe is the most accurate and real portrayal of life inside the \\"family.\\"  Based on a true story, it does just that, stays true to the events that transpired.    The acting is phenominal; everyone who had an acting role in this movie played their parts perfectly.  Robert De Niro gives what I believe is his best performance of his career, and Ray Liotta takes the lead role and runs with it!  Add the always awesome Joe Pesci, and the unforgettable Lorraine Bracco and you have one of the biggest all-star casts of all time!    The directing is also very phenominal (as expected.)  Nothing is over-exaggerated or forced, the story is what it is and the viewer is made to take that for what its worth.  Truly one of Martin's greatest films (if not THE greatest!)    If you love other mafia/crime based movies or shows (ala Sopranos) than this is a MUST SEE and even a MUST OWN!  It has already become a classic and shows no signs of slowing down!

0385486804|5.0|I'd been a fan of John Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" when I picked up this work, not knowing what this was about.  After finishing it, it left just as many questions unanswered as it did stir emotions.      Chris McCandless was a seemingly average kid in Virginia who adopted a harsh stance on life in his young adulthood.  Rejecting the materialism and ideals of his affulent parents, Chris seemed to hate who he was.  After graduating from Emory University in 1992, he walked away from it all, never to see or speak to his family again, to live the life of a drifter.  It was his dream to leave it all behind and live on the fringe of society, and sure enough he did just that.  Adopting the new name Alexander Supertramp, he hitched all across America, Mexico and Canada, telling all he met on the way that it was his ultimate goal to someday go to Alaska and live off the land as our pioneering ancestors.    True to his word, Alex made it to Alaska.  Perhaps no one summed up his inexperience and fate than the truck driver outside Fairbanks, the last person who saw him alive.  As he excitedly told him about his dream to live off the land and how at long last he had reached Alaska.  The truck driver told him that he could tell by looking at him that he wasn't a local, and as he gave rides to a lot of people like him with such dreams he offered to take him into town to buy him some gear.  Alex refused, but the driver gave him his phone number in case he was in trouble.  And he went off into the wild ...    ALex would camp in an abandoned school bus on a small island within a national park near Mount McKinley.  His diaries would tell of how his excitement would eventually turn to caution until eventual panic and the disjointed serenity of starvation.  He couldn't leave the island after the spring thaw, as the shallow stream he had crossed to get to the island had turned into a raging river, and he couldn't swim.  Strangely enough, when his body was found months after his death by hunters, he had left a note that his name was Chris McCandless, not Alexander Supertramp.      This book was writen as a warning.  And I don't just say that because of what happened to Chris.  I say this because of the hypocrisy of the idealistic hippie culture that he embraced.  It's not just something from the 60s, it's been around much longer.  They were also quick to point out that many of the authors that he built his ideals on (Thoureau, London, etc.) were drunks who wrote their famous works while working through their hangovers.  And, like their idols (except Chris did not seem to partake in it), those who idealize their idols follow in their footsteps to embrace their destructive qualities.  Living on the fringe of society may seem romantic and idealistic, and Chris did that.  I'm sure he met his share of the criminal element and other shaddy people, but we only heard from the good people he met on his travels.  Not to mention I can't believe a person would be this self centered to put their friends and family through this.  How could he walk away from them without so much as a good-bye?      A wonderful book for a weekend warrior or a professional outdoorsman, or just a curious party like myself.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|even though I don't usually like to listen to alot of pop music, after hearing Breakaway I really liked it, it was very catchy and mature, some even dark.   After hearing Never Again and Sober I decided to buy My Decemember, those two songs were AWESOME, especially Sober, it's a whole new sound, and sounds very close to progressive rock, starting from acoustic and builts up, very powerful, I was literally cheering Kelly on!!!!    However after hearing the whole album I didn't think it was as good as I hope it to be, Never Again and Sober are basically the only two songs that really stood out. Rest of the songs were okay, but not as good. Judas and Hunted were okay, after the first half of the album the second half were like the air went out of the balloon, the songs were no longer as powerful, and some were even boring, I listened to the album many times and the second half of the songs just didn't grow on me. the songs on the album overall did not flow very well, it was like excitment just went out of the window after a few tracks. the songs were still catchy, but just not those I feel like listening again and again.    the lyrics were very dark, which I like, I think Kelly is definitely improving with her lyrics writing    Overall I like the change very much and apprciate it.

0374105235|4.0|One of the greatest qualities of African culture is the respect given to the elders and the sense of communal responsibility.  The reason being that they have life experiences that will help guide the younger ones through their journey through life.      In A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier a culture that Ishmael was born into and was being educated within the mores of his society all of a sudden is turned upside down.  Survival became the word of the day and in order to survive everyone had to do anything and everything within his/her power to ensure his/her self preservation. The community had lost its bearings and its members. Consequently, fear and terror reign supreme, most of the mores of the traditional society is thrown out the window. That leads one to ask, what will happen to all the oral tradition that has  died with the older ones as the younger ones kill them off?      All through the 228 pages of the book, the reader begins to question the rationale of war and the incessant need of adults to recruit children into wars that they (adults) started anyway. The author adeptly demonstrates how childhood and its memories is robbed as a result of the war and the scars that victims carry for life.     This book  should be one of the many mandatory readings in African Military Academies, secondary schools, colleges and universities.  Hopefully, future African leaders can draw lessons from the narrative and strive for peace and prosperity within their communities.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|I was never a fan of the Ghost Rider comics, though I would have been if they had been introduced about ten years earlier.  This movie is just a great adventure for a fan or someone like me who had never read a single copy of the comic.  The story stands up by itself due to the excellent expositions coming from Sam Elliott. Nicholas Cage gives an excellent performance based (sort of) on the characters of Evil Knievel and Elvis Presley. I think that his performance in the conversion scene is nearly as good as the scene where Spencer Tracy played Dr Jekyll turning into Mr Hyde. Of course, Spencer didn't have the wonderful special effects to back up his performance.  I must say that even though the plot and the performances by the actors were up to the highest standards, the real stars of this movie were the special effects and CGI graphics. These were far above average and well used, but were not allowed to interfere with the story line and character developement, Which are an important part of any Marvel story.  The final touch that really makes the show great is the song \\"riders in the Sky\\" performed by the Australian band Spiderbait.  I hope that they have albums for sale, because this is an excellent version of this old ballad turned into a hard rock masterpiece.  This movie is a \\"must have\\" for horror, adventure, and Marvel comics fans.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|it can be considered a non-special musical broadway, one more of all the musicals... but it's not. The voice of Elphaba is very rare and moving, it's a surrounding voice.  the pitty of this musical: still haven't released it on dvd. What are they waiting for?
B00007KWHG|5.0|This is the greatest CD I have ever purchased. It takes me back to my teenage years. The songs on it are the best ever. I would reccomend this CD to everyone.

B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins is one of the best super-hero movies of all time. I'm a fan of superhero movies and I've seen all the Superman, Spiderman, and Batman films. But I'm not a fanatic. I don't read the comics or know about the \\"true\\" stories of these characters. I don't care about that. I just want to see a good movie. Batman Begins was a summer blockbuster in 2005  and it actually tried to do something none of the other summer blockbusters ever do. It tried to tell a story.<br /><br />From the title, you learn this is a story of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. Probably the first hour of the movie is spent developing the character of Bruce Wayne, showing how he suffered after his parents were murdered, how he abandoned the privelege of his birth for a live of crime and self-inflicted punishment. The first part of the movie works in part because of the great cast. Christian Bale as Wayne is incredible. Other greats such as Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and a menacing Cilian Murphy make every moment on screen enthralling.<br /><br />Equally enjoying is the transformation of Wayne into Batman. It is portrayed as realistic as it can considering it is a superhero movie. Wayne uses the recources of Lucious Fox at a secret R&D section of Wayne Enterprises. There, he finds all the tools he'll need as Batman, including an incredible Bat-Mobile.<br /><br />If you are like me, the George Clooney batman movie kind of soured you on the story of Batman. If so, you must watch this movie. The acting is great, the story is crisp, the action and characters are gritty and real. I can't wait for the upcoming sequel in 2008.
B0000549B0|5.0|I had never seen this old movie before, but it's a favorite of my husband's so I bought it for him.  We watched it and it's now a favorite of mine too.  It's a cute story - very simple, but so funny!    I noticed some reviewers commented on the colorized version - we got the black and white version and I recommend it.
B000O174CM|1.0|This movie is terrible. I'm not surprised it made its way so fast to DVD - 2 hours of screaming - I don't call it singing. None of the songs had a melody, does not compare to Diana Ross and the Supremes, if this is what this story was supposed to be about. I turned it off 1 1/4 hour into the DVD - couldn't care less what happened to the characters. It seems people either hated or loved this one - I couldn't stand it. So far the worse movie I watched in 2007.
B000OCZD5G|4.0|The Road Warrior is a classic action film and the movie that first demonstrated what a star Mel Gibson would soon be.  Filmed in Australia by George Miller, this sequel to their original film, Mad Max, is a post-apocalyptic demolition derby.  It was created before the dawn of CGI, and all of it's stunts are for real, and breathtaking; particularly a stunt where one of the road predators is thrown end-over-end out of his crashed vehicle.    The Blu-ray version of the movie is brilliant, the film probably never looked as good in it's initial theatrical run.  There is no comparison between the Blu-ray and DVD images.  The colors and detail in this HD presentation are spectacular.  There are moments in the film where the focus is somewhat soft on the edges, but I suspect this is a flaw in the principal photography and not the new transfer.  The night time scenes in the middle of the film weren't a solid black, but had a little noise which I again attribute to the original negative, considering how good the rest of the film looks.    I definitely recomend this Blu-ray for any action movie fans and fans of this film series.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I love Veronica Mars. I don't use past tense here because even thought he show has been cancelled, I still love it. I still watch the first two seasons on DVD and have kept a few of the Season 3 episodes on my TIVO.<br /><br />That being said, Season Three had its ups and downs. Kind-of like Season 4 of Buffy, taking VM out of High School and into college came with his great moments and it's failures. There were some brilliant episodes, some just plain amazing, and some that were just okay (But an okay episode of VM is still 10 times better than most of the crap on TV)! I feel that if the CW had let Rob Thomas do his thing, we would have gotten a stronger season. And maybe a 4th.<br /><br />Season Three was great VM. The season as a whole wasn't the strongest (most would say 1 still is but I argue for 2 - loved the whole year-long story arc) as the others but still it was pure Veronica Mars.<br /><br />I'm going to miss Veronica Mars but I still very much love the show!
B00005V9IK|5.0|Synopsis: Reminiscent of the classic `War of the Worlds' once again the world is under siege, this time from a highly advanced race of locust-like aliens from outer space who move from planet to planet devouring all its natural resources before moving on. When conventional methods of military engagement fail miserably a new plan to destroy the enemy must be devised. If we fail again our extinction is certain.<br /><br />Released in '96 `Independence Day' was the film that brought the possible threat of the OTHER aliens back into the forefront of our collective consciousness while also proving once and for all that Will Smith was more than just a comedian. While the basic plot has been done many times before there are numerous subtle and not-so-sublte comedic moments in the storyline along with an eclectic and somewhat oddball cast set this one apart from other movies in the sci-fi genre, making for a truly unique and enjoyable viewing experience. Add to that awesome special effects and a solid soundtrack, you've got a hit on your hands!
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Film gets better and better as it goes along, after a bitter beginning in which the scratches and breaks of primitive cinema are aped to give that old time patina, or lustre, to persuade you that you are watching a documentary from that era.  (When is the era, anyhow?  Though Eisenheim uses actual firepots to illuminate his act, it must be set somewhat after the age of electricity, for Paul Giamatti's police constables produce from nowhere a fully operative movie projector and switch it on!)  (And on an adjoining screen we see a sophisticated, and Technicolor moving image years before Technicolor was actually invented!)  Like Coppola's DRACULA, or like the recent musical MOULIN ROUGE, director Neil Burger brings in the flaws and cracks of silent era film, and instantly takes us back to the day, though it's not 100 per cent convincing.  Nor is his use of Prague for Vienna of all places, when the two cities are so radically different, but Prague must be fantastically cheaper to film in.  But that's standard movie practice today, the way that, if one's only exposure to New York City was through the cinema, you would be forgiven for thinking it looks exactly like Toronto.<br /><br />Anyhow I soon found myself caught up in the story, and to my surprise, Paul Giamatti was much better than he's been in years, and as for Jessica Biel, well, she has a new spring in her step, and she repays the confidence Burger placed in her, for her part couldn't have been an easy one and yet she's truthful and honest in nearly every scene.  Does Ed Norton ever hold a ball of light as he does on the DVD cover and poster?  I don't think so, but the one pose Eisenheim falls into, arm extended, fingers charging the air around his hand with electricity, is a commanding, Universal horror one.  It might also have been invented by Karloff or Lugosi, and yet Norton carries it off.<br /><br />Who was that actress from Canada who used to be in every other spooky sort of art movie, like Cronenberg's CRASH or Fincher's THE GAME--and she looked like a prototype for Jessica Biel, with the same unseeing eyes and fat, bruised lips?  I know, I know, Deborah Kara Unger.  She wouldn't have been bad either.  She's so great and I haven't seen her since WHITE NOISE.<br /><br />In THE ILLUSIONIST, is it just me, or how bad is Burger's dialogue whenever Jessica Biel is addressed?  She's playing Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen.  Does this mean that fellow noblewomen will be saying, \\"Your dress is so pretty, Duchess von Teschen!\\"  The best is when she goes missing and the Vienna Woods swarm with volunteers all calling out, \\"Duchess von Teschen!  Duchess von Teschen!\\"  No wonder she's not responding, boys.s THE GAME--and she looked like a prototype for Jessica Biel, with the same unseeing eyes and fat, bruised lips?

B0002VYQ2U|4.0|You can tell I am smitten by her singing. I absolutely loved \\"Come away with me\\". Can't remember how many times I have heard that album. This CD to wasnt quite at that level, but still incredible. The Song 'sunrise' is phenomenal. Buy this pack, for the DVD is a nice bonus! Highly recommended CD.
B000816TCY|5.0|Purchased a couple spare batteries for my Coolpix S50. I was hesitant to use an aftermarket brand, so I shopped around for a good price on real Nikon batteries from a vendor I trust: Amazon/Adorama. It looks like the price has gone up since I purchased ($17.95) so do your homework.
B00005JPLW|4.0|I really love 300. I went to see the movie twice.  I didn't get up once when the movie started.  This movie was fun from the beginning to the end.

But cross marky mark....forgetttttabbout it!!  Marky plays a brash, take no guff, prisoner of the state. Entombed in the jail cell of his mind, from which no light (or love ((will get to that later))) can escape.  The man who emprisoned him is no other than samuel jackson of lethal weapon fame. Lets just say sam traded mel gibson in for a retainer and a slick suit!!  Anyways, I think Marky plays a young soldier trying to get revenge or something. The plot was really confusing at the time, because I was also pretty out of it. It was around 105* degrees out and I had just taken some cold medicine. Bad head cold, we've all been there right?  Anyways, I'm pretty sure marky ends up winning.
B00005JPHT|4.0|*<br />Michael Moore sucks. And \\"Sicko\\", his latest liberal attack on the government is more of the same. Don't waste your money.<br /><br />Hmmm. Hum. Hmmm. Hmmmm<br /><br />Okay, are all of the Michael Moore bashers out of the room? Good. Now we can actually discuss the film \\"Sicko\\".<br /><br />****<br /><br />If you have seen any of Moore's previous films, \\"Sicko\\" will look familiar. Moore combines a number of moving stories of real people with a number of segments where he serves as a `roving reporter' and tries to get to the bottom of certain issues. Expectations for this new film are high, based on the enormous success of his last film \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\". Because of the subject matter, and the enormous amount of press, both good and bad, \\"9/11\\" became the most successful documentary ever. When I went to see the film, I bought my tickets in advance and still had to wait in line due to the sheer volume of people trying to get in to see the film. \\"Sicko\\" is similar in tone and feel to his previous film, but it isn't quite the same hot button issue and will not receive the same amount of press, publicity, or dollars.<br /><br />Many people attack Michael Moore's films because they are \\"documentaries\\". \\"Well, they don't tell the truth\\". \\"He's a liar\\". A documentary, any documentary, has to have a point of view. We have to know why the filmmaker is telling their story. Why is this idea important to them? If they don't have or exhibit a point of view, the film would be a pointless waste of your time and money. It wouldn't be compelling. You may disagree with some or all of the filmmaker's point of view, but at least they have one.<br /><br />Moore has taken on some hot-button topics in his films. I think he does this for two reasons; because he wants to help make people aware of these problems and encourage them to act and also because he knows he will create more publicity by attacking them. As the old saying goes, there is no such thing as bad publicity. So, Moore has taken on gun control, big corporations and the George W. Bush presidency, all in an attempt to give us more information and to try to prompt us to take action. Because of his previous films, Moore is not exactly a sight any one running a company wants to see coming at them. In fact, I think I might have an accident if I saw Moore headed towards me holding a microphone. What did I do wrong?<br /><br />In \\"Sicko\\", Moore turns his camera on the health care industry. Or, as he has said in a number of interviews, the lack of such. He talks to a number of people about their problems. One woman shows pictures of her car after an accident. Then, we see the bill and learn the insurance company denied her claim for an ambulance because it wasn't pre-approved. As she comments \\"When was I supposed to have it pre-approved? After I regained consciousness but before they put me on the ambulance.\\" There are a number of stories like this and they are heartbreaking.<br /><br />Why are these stories so heartbreaking? Because each of these people did what they were supposed to do. They did what we have done. They got insurance. And we could just as easily be in their shoes.<br /><br />As Moore delves deeper into the problem, he notes that insurance companies don't make money if they pay claims, so they hire people, doctors, and medical professionals, to deny whatever claims they can and to figure out new ways to deny other claims.<br /><br />Moore spends some time discussing what a `pre-existing health condition' means to these companies. After he sets this up, he shows a list of all of the pre-existing conditions, which could get your coverage denied. Worse, because some of these conditions are relatively banal, if they find out later that you have one of them, after paying out a claim, they may deny the claim and sue you to get the money back. The list of `pre-existing' conditions is extensive and runs a long time, even at the accelerated speed we see in the film.<br /><br />Thereis also a segment dealing with Hilary Clinton's stewardship of the Universal Health Care initiative she tried to get off the ground when her husband was President. Not surprisingly, the plan never materialized. Now, with Hilary the Democratic front-runner, and using this as a campaign talking point again, it might come as a surprise what Moore reveals in \\"Sicko\\". But then again, it probably shouldn't surprise you that much.<br /><br />And Moore visits other Western countries already employing the concept of Universal Healthcare. In visits to Great Britain and France, he finds that people receive the health care they need but more importantly, they receive the preventative care they need. As he talks to people in these countries and they reveal the extent of this coverage and what it means to them, I defy you to not allow your mouth to drop open. As he talked to more and more people in Paris, both French citizens and American ex-patriots living there, and they revealed more and more of the benefits they currently receive, I was ready to pack my bags.<br /><br />As Moore tells us one story after another of normal, ordinary, everyday people and their problems with the healthcare industry, he really tugs at the heartstrings. These are people just like you and me. Their problems could happen to any one of us as well.<br /><br />Then, Moore turns his attention to a sampling of 9/11 Rescue Workers. The NYC Firemen and Policemen who rushed to the scene are presumably covered by their respective health care plans. But what about all of the other people who rushed down there to lend a hand? All of the people in the Armed Forces? The good Samaritans? All of the people who volunteered their efforts to help save people? These people didn't hesitate to help out. In the process, they also breathed the toxic fumes and are now experiencing many of the same ailments many of New York's finest are living with. But are they getting any medical help? As Moore illustrates with a sound bite from Governor Pataki, they will be covered provided they can prove they were there, they spent a certain amount of time there, they helped out with the rescue effort, they sign an affidavit, etc. How many volunteers who were involved with such a chaotic event can provide proof of their participation?<br /><br />Moore also learns the detainees at Guantanamo Bay receive full health care, including preventative medicine and this doesn't add up for the filmmaker. The people who helped out during the rescue effort can't get the medical care they need but the people suspected of causing the harm can? Moore grabs his subjects and they travel to Miami. He rents a boat and they make their way to Guantanamo Bay. It is an amusing piece and the story continues from there to show how these same people are treated when they actually arrive in Cuba.<br /><br />This last bit is also pretty typical Moore, and, I suspect, a point that drives many of his critics crazy. It is a staged bit, much like when he ambushed Charlton Heston for a scene in \\"Bowling for Columbine\\", and it is debatable whether it has a place in a documentary. But Moore is trying to make a point and while the set-up may be artificial, the outcome is what he wants to show. And it is an effective argument.<br /><br />\\"Sicko\\" is a very good, funny, emotional look at a corrupt part of our community. It doesn't pack the emotional wallop of \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" or address as incendiary a hot-button topic, but it is a very good conversation starter nonetheless.<br /><br />Now, hopefully people will go out and talk and come up with a solution to the problem.itiative she tried to get off the ground when her husband was President.

B00005JPD0|1.0|I feel like this movie has been made before, hence the name. Can you say unoriginal??  It's stuff like this that makes me not want to take the wife and rugrats to the cinema anymore?
B00005JPQT|4.0|Wow! I feel like such a man. After \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\", the 4th installment in the \\"Die Hard\\" franchise, my testosterone is at an all time high after watching John McClane (Bruce Willis) do battle with another group of bad guys. He kicks some butt and I feel all the more manly because of it.<br /><br />John McClane is asked by his supervisor to pick up a known hacker, Matt Farrell (Justin Long, the Apple commercials, \\"Accepted\\"), and transport him to Washington to be questioned by the NSA. The NSA has just had a major security breech in their system and they want to question all hackers who could have participated in such an event. As McClane arrives at Farrell's apartment to take him in, a group of hired thugs working for Gabriel Chase (Timothy Olyphant) arrive to kill Farrell; he is the last hacker who helped them with various pieces of the puzzle for their plan. Now he is expendable, so he must die. The bullets fly and McClane does everything he can to protect Farrell. As soon as they are in the car, the truth sinks in for Farrell and he can't come up with any reason why someone would want to kill him. They arrive in Washington, DC, just as the 4th of July Festivities are set to begin and things start to go wrong; the traffic lights go out, computers crash and a cryptic message plays on every television station. McClane knows they are in for trouble. Chase's men are still after Farrell, so McClane has to protect him and find out what connection he is. Then Farrell realizes what is happening; it's a \\"Fire Sale\\". Someone is attempting to shut down every computer system in the United States. In other words, they are trying to shut down everything. Will McClane be able to save Farrell, the United States and his daughter while uttering memorable catch phrases?<br /><br />Testosterone. This is the real reason I enjoy going to these films. As I have mentioned a few times, I love these Joel Silver-type action films, in which a hero has to fight against insurmountable odds to win the day (the girl, his family, his freedom, etc.). And there isn't a better example of this genre than the original \\"Die Hard\\" directed by John McTiernan and starring Bruce Willis. \\"Die Hard\\" is the story of an everyday guy, a cop from New York in Los Angeles to reconcile with his wife on Christmas Eve. Unfortunately, a group of terrorists, led by Alan Rickman, take the company hostage and McClane finds himself in the middle of a deadly situation. Great action, crisp dialogue, a fantastic villain and a likeable hero all help to make \\"Die Hard\\" one of the best action films ever made, and the template for many copies, some of which weren't bad either. With the inevitable sequel, director Renny Harlin placed McClane in the middle of an airport during a hostage crisis. Building, airport, both are enclosed environments, sort of. In \\"Die Hard with a Vengeance\\", Willis' McClane has to travel all over New York to outrun villain Jeremy Irons, while trying to keep his sidekick, Samuel L. Jackson safe. The sequels were fun, but they seemed to be pale retreads.<br /><br />With \\"Live Free and Die Hard\\", director Len Wiseman (\\"Underworld\\") places McClane in the middle of a cyber terrorist attack led by villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant, \\"Catch and Release\\", HBO's \\"Deadwood\\") and his crew of cyber hackers. Ooooooh, cyber - hackers. Scary.<br /><br />Olyphant is an interesting choice to play an uber-villain like Gabriel. He glowers and shows his thin smile on more than one occasion and these two elements help him look menacing, to a certain degree. Soft spoken, much like his character Seth Bullock on \\"Deadwood\\", he isn't a man you want to cross. And the fact Gabriel surrounds himself with so many guns and European goons make him even scarier. This is also a villain with a good, interesting plan to extract terror. As the film progresses, we learn he may have a closer connection to the rest of the plot than we initially thought, tying in his motive more concretely. I don't think anyone could ever top Alan Rickman in the first \\"Die Hard\\", but Olyphant does a nice job of creating his own persona.<br /><br />The addition of Maggie Q as Gabriel's girlfriend helps to amp up the danger quotient for McClane and Farrell. Maggie Q's character is completely devoted to Gabriel and his cause, and he is completely devoted to her, so she will do anything to help him. When she comes into contact with McClane and Farrell, she isn't going to give up easily and starts kicking and hitting, using every karate and martial arts move in her repertoire.<br /><br />Cyril Raffaelli, a French stuntman plays one of Chase's goons. After the attack in Farrell's apartment, as McClane and Farrell head for the cop's car, Raffaelli's character spots them and starts to bounce down the sides of the building, seemingly using exposed nails for his feet, to the alley below. I first saw Raffaelli in the Luc Besson produced \\"District 13\\", a French film with a lot of amazing stunt work, much of which is know as `Free running' or `Parkour', when the character seems to literally bounce from one spot to the next, moving at incredible speeds. Then in last year's \\"Casino Royale\\", Bond chased another practitioner of this kind of stunt work. Every time Raffaelli appears in \\"Live Free\\", the stunts take on a faster pace, making the action move at a breakneck speed. This helps to make the film all the more thrilling.<br /><br />\\"Live Free\\" has some amazing stunts, most of which were done with real stunt men and not CGI. The clip with McClane taking out an airborne helicopter with a car has been seen many times, but this happens in the first act. When I watched the film and realized this was happening early, I was a little disappointed. I was afraid they wouldn't be able to top it. But there are two more elaborate stunt sequences, one of which is so over the top; it is a lot of fun to watch. And naturally, there are a couple of good, old-fashioned hand-to-hand combat scenes \\"Die Hard\\" style. When McClane engages one or more of the bad guys, they are always willing to fight to the death, so McClane gets beaten up, bruised and bloodied.<br /><br />Both McClane and Farrell have a number of one-liners, which help to elicit laughter. But they don't seem to be added merely to make people laugh, they generally occur at tense moments, to help the audience relax a little. When Farrell manages to utter an amusing quip, it helps to show how scared he is. McClane is just a smart aleck and uses these lines to elevate his tense mood.<br /><br />In the best examples of these action films, the hero has to have a personal stake in the action, to make him continue to fight and battle with the villains. In fact, this has become a clich&eacute;. In some, the young hero meets a girl just as bullets start flying. He tries to protect her by dragging her out of harm's way and she becomes a part of the story because the villains mistake them for lovers. Of course, they will become lovers. This is an over-used and weak method of giving the hero a personal stake in the outcome. Just as naturally, this same girl will fall into the victim's hands before the end of the film. In \\"Live Free\\", McClane's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is added to the mix and it shouldn't come as any surprise that she will end up in Chase's hands, the formula can't deviate from that, but she proves to be a feisty young woman, very feisty indeed. Every time she exhibits this, she further proves how much like her father she actually is.<br /><br />\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is one of the better action films I have seen in the last few years, and a fitting sequel to one of the best action films ever. It is nice to see Bruce Willis in a role that we enjoy, welcome and embrace.r top Alan Rickman in the first \\"Die Hard\\", but Olyphant does a nice job of creating his own persona.    The addition of Maggie Q as Gabriel's girlfriend helps to amp up the danger quotient for McClane and Farrell. Maggie Q's character is completely devoted to Gabriel and his cause, and he is completely devoted to her, so she will do anything to help him. When she comes into contact with McClane and Farrell, she isn't going to give up easily and starts kicking and hitting, using every karate and martial arts move in her repertoire.    Cyril Raffaelli, a French stuntman plays one of Chase's goons. After the attack in Farrell's apartment, as McClane and Farrell head for the cop's car, Raffaelli's character spots them and starts to bounce down the sides of the building, seemingly using exposed nails for his feet, to the alley below. I first saw Raffaelli in the Luc Besson produced \\"District 13\\", a French film with a lot of amazing stunt work, much of which is know as `Free running' or `Parkour', when the character seems to literally bounce from one spot to the next, moving at incredible speeds. Then in last year's \\"Casino Royale\\", Bond chased another practitioner of this kind of stunt work. Every time Raffaelli appears in \\"Live Free\\", the stunts take on a faster pace, making the action move at a breakneck speed. This helps to make the film all the more thrilling.    \\"Live Free\\" has some amazing stunts, most of which were done with real stunt men and not CGI. The clip with McClane taking out an airborne helicopter with a car has been seen many times, but this happens in the first act. When I watched the film and realized this was happening early, I was a little disappointed. I was afraid they wouldn't be able to top it. But there are two more elaborate stunt sequences, one of which is so over the top; it is a lot of fun to watch. And naturally, there are a couple of good, old-fashioned hand-to-hand combat scenes \\"Die Hard\\" style. When McClane engages one or more of thebad guys, they are always willing to fight to the death, so McClane gets beaten up, bruised and bloodied.    Both McClane and Farrell have a number of one-liners, which help to elicit laughter. But they don't seem to be added merely to make people laugh, they generally occur at tense moments, to help the audience relax a little. When Farrell manages to utter an amusing quip, it helps to show how scared he is. McClane is just a smart aleck and uses these lines to elevate his tense mood.    In the best examples of these action films, the hero has to have a personal stake in the action, to make him continue to fight and battle with the villains. In fact, this has become a cliché. In some, the young hero meets a girl just as bullets start flying. He tries to protect her by dragging her out of harm's way and she becomes a part of the story because the villains mistake them for lovers. Of course, they will become lovers. This is an over-used and weak method of giving the hero a personal stake in the outcome. Just as naturally, this same girl will fall into the victim's hands before the end of the film. In \\"Live Free\\", McClane's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is added to the mix and it shouldn't come as any surprise that she will end up in Chase's hands, the formula can't deviate from that, but she proves to be a feisty young woman, very feisty indeed. Every time she exhibits this, she further proves how much like her father she actually is.    \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is one of the better action films I have seen in the last few years, and a fitting sequel to one of the best action films ever.

B00003CXV4|4.0|I liked the expedited serviced, but what I didnt like was that this movie wasn´t well described in all of their features. I ordered the movie as a gift for someone else, hoping that it included subtitles in Spanish, but that wasn´t specified in the general review at Amazon´s  (in fact, it didn´t specified what the languajes of the subtitles were, as all of the movies reviewed at Amazon´s).    I really would like to know, for future purchases, that the movies listed were rated at all of their features, specifically of the languajes of their subtitles.
B00068IOWC|4.0|I just love this band, this a a very good U2 release.  I was not very impressed by this band until \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" in the 80's.  They have lost me with \\"Pop\\" and \\"Zooropa\\" but they have touch right on target with \\"All that you can't leave behind\\".  \\"How to dismantle an atomic bomb\\" is in the same field of the previous cd.  Many hits, very good ballads, incredible voice by Bono.  For sure, as some reviewer mentionned, his voice is not as it once was, but the emotion is there as never before.  I just love \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\", this is an amazing song with such a level of emotion.  I have the edition \\"Deluxe\\" and to me, the couch version of this song is a pure jewel. It is an acoustic version that is incredible.  Buy it !

1400063515|5.0|In his new book Nassim Nicholas Taleb uses the term \\"black swan\\" to describe unpredictable or improbable events, completely out of the ordinary, completely unexpected. More specifically, for the purposes of the book, in order to qualify as a black swan an event a) must be unexpected, unpredictable, unprecedented, b) must have high impact, in other words important consequences, c) must be retrospective, it must be an event that people analyze, identify the conditions that preceded it, figure out the reasons that caused it \\"after\\" the event. By this definition 9/11 was a black swan. So was the demise of the Soviet Union. All of the important historical events were black swans for that matter. On a personal level, all the important decisions (marriage, choice of profession, major moves, etc.) are also black swans.    By their very nature, black swan events are unpredictable. Yet these are the ones that shape history and also our daily lives. The implication is that, our lives are at the mercy of randomness. This is a big claim but Mr. Taleb is very convincing in his argument. A big part of the book consists of the reasons why we as human beings are unable to see that we are at the mercy of randomness.    Part of the problem is our illusion of understanding probabilities, our addiction to listening \\"scientific\\" explanations, \\"expert\\" opinions, our need to find reasons. To understand the illusion, we have to be aware of two types of randomness. Perhaps it is best to explain with some of his own examples:    Let's hypothesize that a Martian is trying to figure out the average height of humans on Earth and he is choosing people from different parts of the world to make his sampling as random as possible, and he measures their height. For practical purposes, after about 100 such measurement he can safely assume that he found the average and he can predict the height of his next sample within a certain range. Such predictions represent a probability distribution graph in theshape of a bell (Gaussian bell curve). This is the textbook type of randomness. But let's assume that the same Martian is trying to figure out average monetary net worth of human beings. In this case there is a large difference of values and he would need a sample size of much bigger than 100 to even have an \\"sense\\" of the average. One sample that is extremely outside of the running average (say someone like Bill Gates being the current sample), has a huge impact and would change the current average considerably. This would be a black swan.    A more realistic example in the book is about casinos. Normal operation of a casino requires calculating and knowing the probabilities of the games to ensure that the casino has an edge over the customers. Any given day, individual gamblers' luck varies randomly but this is the first type of randomness as in the above example. No matter how great is somebody's lucky run, it wouldn't be so great that he would break the casino. And casinos spend a lot of energy in ensuring their edge by setting playing rules, limits on bets, surveillance etc. But there are some real life examples in casino businesses that caused huge losses for casinos, and those losses resulted from unexpected things. One of them is the end of the show \\"Siegfried and Roy\\". It was a Las Vegas attraction and a major source of getting the crowds to that particular casino. But after the unexpected accident (it was a show with tigers, one of the tigers, after so many years, attacked the performer) the show was stopped and there was a noticeable drop in the number of customers in the casino as well. The estimated amount of loss is around 100 million dollars! This came as a result of something that nobody expected, and had a huge impact. It was a random occurrence of the second type. It was a black swan.     Any situation of unpredictability in real life involves the second type of randomness. But probability theory in mathematics deal mainly with the first type of randomness. That's why, according to Mr. Taleb, those math experts with their degrees and computer simulations are not to be trusted with their predictions because things that are trying to predict (stock market, economic indicators, political events in the near future etc.) involve the second type of randomness. In fact, these types of scenarios cannot reliably be predicted. Again, this is a big claim but Mr. Taleb supports his view with records of \\"experts\\" which show how terribly wrong they were majority of the time.    There is an interesting, and humorous example in the book comparing an expert's thinking to someone with no formal education but became successful in business world and has a practical way of approaching the problems. The author asks these (imaginary) characters this question: \\"Suppose I have a fair coin (heads and tails have an equal probability). I toss the coin 99 times and in each time a get a tail. When I toss it for the 100th time, what is the probability that I get a head?\\". The math expert answers \\"50 percent\\", which is, mathematically true. The wise guy says \\"less than 1 percent of course\\". When he was told that the expert thinks it is 50 percent, he answers in a humorous way, reflecting his lack of respect for the expert, but the important thing is his line of reasoning. He thinks that if the 99 consecutive tosses showed tails, for all practical purposes it is far more likely that the initial assumption about the coin being fair is wrong than the coin delivering 99 heads in 99 tosses! The expert is thinking completely inside the box. Wise guy on the other hand is thinking outside the box!    Mr. Taleb got some criticism about his use of fictitious characters and his ridicule of the experts (as in the above example). True, he has an unorthodox writing style for a book of such important subject and big claims but I believe he did that on purpose. His sense of humor throughout the book makes it more accessible and fun while at the same timekeeping the seriousness intact. This is a very difficult balance and as far as I am concerned Mr. Taleb is doing a great job not only in his very detailed and convincing way of presenting his argument, but also keeping the reader's attention and enjoyment alive. It's a unique book in that sense, itself a black swan.
0143038419|5.0|The themes in this book are universal, and the author's honesty about her situation was truly inspiring.  Elizabeth Gilbert is an unbelievable writer, and our book club never generated so much discussion.  A thoughtful, insightful book that has already become my favorite.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|The scenery and imagery of the planet as we know it, is awesome. Not for the youngest people in your family if natural birth and death are an issue that you really don't want to have to explain. A little gruesome and depressing for our 5 year old. However, for the rest of us, we all love it and enjoy watching over and over. Plus, David Attenboroughs narration is perfect.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|It continually amazes me how people can look at the same thing and have such wide-ranging opinions of its worth.  I found this film to my liking, although I didn't cotton to the ending.  In order to enjoy this movie, one must have an attention span longer than 10 seconds, and one must enjoy drama that doesn't involve shooting and exploding and car chases and action that is unrealistic/absurd.  The story is realistic, and the acting is superb.  I love stuff that makes sense and is not in la la land.

0307237699|4.0|This book demonstrates eloquence, understanding, and an intense passion for this country and what it should stand for. Obama writes beautifully, with focus, but with the intensity of someone who is anticipating the arguments before they've been made. And that isn't such a bad thing, particularly for someone who is running for President. He does, however, need a better editor. Obama relies too heavily on anecdotes and sometimes gets a tad formulaic in his presentation of each chapter. The points are made, but then at times, run into the ground by an overabundance of examples.<br /><br />That aside, the book is very well-structured. He wisely ends with \\"Family\\" to leave the reader with the best impression of a man who isn't afraid to extol his wife's domestic and professional abilities, but without the sense of hero worship. He's not afraid to express his love in real terms or to admit the struggles in their marriage. It is in this final chapter than the anecdotes ring most true.<br /><br />However, for those that believe Obama is too \\"green\\" to be President, I'd hold off until you read this book. He has a better understanding of history, law, politics and social justice than most people on Capitol Hill. He's managed to move forward (up?) in his career, but has always had one foot firmly planted in the neighborhoods of his constituents.<br /><br />It is a shame that those who do not support Obama are unlikely to read this book, as it is a revealing portrait...not set on changing political views, but opening up an honest dialogue...a dialogue very much absent from current American politics.
B00006IU73|5.0|I liked Porcupine Tree's Deadwing a lot, so when more than one person told me In Absentia was better it definitely piqued my interest. Overall, I'd say it is the superior album, although not by a whole lot. From what I can tell, Steven Wilson is the real driving creative force behind the band, and he knows how to use all of his assets. He has a very nice, calming singing voice, and he uses it a lot to create light and catchy choruses that can still have an edge. His voice along with some of their lighter tracks contrast sharply with their ability to really dig deep and bring some really good hard moments. As I've said before, it's not prog metal, just prog, but there are a lot of metal elements. I find Wilson has a tendency to use a lot of voice effects where it seems applicable. Usually it's distorted in some way like it's coming through a megaphone, and it lends a strangeness that fits the tone of the song really well. The band's musicianship is quite strong, they are capable of both very strong melodies and enjoyable breakdowns with good solo work. If you have the time, it's the kind of album that benefits from a real listen all the way through.    \\"Blackest Eyes\\" starts with a little picked, distorted intro before the explosive guitars come in, leading to the typical contrasting refrain. \\"Trains\\" follows with a great example of how different the band can be song to song. It's more acoustic and rhythmic. \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" starts as a really soft, minimal song before breaking down with a very hard and entertaining instrumental section. \\"Wedding Nails\\" is entirely instrumental, and features some really great guitar sequences. \\"Prodigal\\" has a good effect-pedaled melody before the chorus with strummed background. \\".3\\" is another mostly instrumental, strongly atmospheric track with nice bass. \\"Strip the Soul\\" is another really good hard song with plenty of jamming to digest before the finale, \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth\\", ends it with a softer song with piano. Despite a variety of sounds it all fits together well as an album, and is really just crafted nicely.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|Like another reviewer, I bought this one based on \\"The Story.\\" Although I've been listening to the CD since it was available a few months ago, I just saw Brandi in Newport and I had to post a review. Along with Amy Winehouse and Regina Spektor, I put this in the top CDs of the year. Unlike those two singers, whom I would describe as refreshing and eclectic but bordering on affected, Brandi Carlile offers something more organic. While some of her songs do sound like others on this CD, overall she demonstrates great vocal range, from elegant and lilting to raw and powerful. The more I listen the more I'm convinced that she can extend beyond the limits of any particular genre--country, folk, rock--in which people want to place her.  That's why I'll keep listening, why I'll buy her older CDs, and why I'll see her again in Boston next week.

0143038419|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  The first (Italy) section is definitely the strongest though.  I was disappointed in her early-on pontification about antidepressant meds (even though she herself took them).      Other reviewers felt she was/is too self-absorbed.  This did not annoy me as I believe she was well aware of this and was self-deprecating in her humor about it.  It would have annoyed me if she had not even realized the degree of her self-absorption.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|I'm Inclined To Agree with her record executives on this one. The album was not as terrible as it was made out to be. But I really don't feel like this CD will have a memorable song on it. Nothing compared to her last CD. With Kelly Clarkson it seems as if it's a hit and miss. Her first CD was good, but not as spectacular as it should of been. Her second CD - basically proved to the music industry and the public that she belonged here, and her third CD left me wondering if she actually does. More and more artists are trying to co-write their own songs. Mandy Moore for is an excellent example of what happens when you are able to write songs. Kelly Clarkson is an excellent example of what happens when you can't. And don't get me wrong, I appreciate what Clarkson is trying to do with this album, but I feel like she tried too hard and she should of done some of the \\"cliche\\" songs. I miss Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Breakaway, I feel as if this CD has too many slow songs on it. And that Never Again will be one of the only songs pulled from it to make a noticeable splash on the charts. The lyrics are amazing, but the tracks are just so off. If Clarkson's next CD is anything like this, I can't say that I will be buying it.
B000SQFC18|4.0|Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Guillermo Arriaga (who have sadly had a falling-out) may be one of the most formidable creative teams in the industry. Without resorting to cheap sentiments or preaching, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu crafts a quietly compelling follow-up to \\"21 Grams,\\" with an introspective look at the interlaced lives after a tragedy.<br /><br />Two boys in Morocco buy a rifle, and while testing it out, they strike a passing tourist bus. Unfortunately, the bullet strikes a vacationing American woman (Cate Blanchett), in the middle of a rural area with no real medical facilities. Unable to be transported, the woman and her husband (Brad Pitt) are dropped off in a rural village, to await help.<br /><br />Unknowingly, the boys have triggered off shattering events in other people's lives across the world -- a troubled, deaf Japanese girl (Rinko Kikuchi) causes a commotion, and the police find that this neglected, lonely teen is the daughter of the man who originally had the boys' rifle. And the American couple's nanny (Adriana Barraza) is delayed going to her son's wedding, and attempts to bring the children into Mexico with her -- with disastrous results.<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" is like a series of completely different photographs, but with the same person in the background. These haunting looks at how lives can be changed in an instant -- and the effects of violence, whether malicious or careless -- makes up the last volume of I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga's \\"Death Trilogy.\\" It illustrates death with the fragility of life.<br /><br />But it's also about the difficulty of communicating in the modern world. You can talk to someone across the world, but sometimes never communicate -- cultures, languages, race, and disabilities can divide people, such as when the border police rush to rescue the American kids, but are callous to the kindly nanny merely because she is not a citizen.<br /><br />And I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu knows how to capture the right feel for the movie, even to giving it shaky, rough cinematography. There's a feeling of powerful emotion even in small scenes, such as Pitt starting to crumble as he makes a phone call. And the movie moves seamlessly from the rocky, dusty Morocco to the flashy, frenetic Tokyo to the relaxed San Diego.<br /><br />Blanchett and Pitt are at the center of the movie (in that order), and both are excellent. Blanchett gives a stunning performance as the critically wounded wife, and Pitt acquits himself well as her anguished husband, as they rediscover their love under duress. Blanchett's performance should definitely garner her an Oscar next year -- and heads should roll if she isn't even nominated!<br /><br />But the supporting cast is also excellent, particularly Kikuchi as the rebellious teenager, who feels isolated from the world around her, and is still grieving from her mother's tragic death. So she acts out sexually. And Barraza gives a solid performance as the nanny, in a nightmarish situation that is particularly haunting because it really happens.<br /><br />Admittedly, a good movie deserves a pretty good special edition, but this two-disc version really doesn't differ that much from the original theatrical release. The primary extra on this is a long \\"making of\\" featurette. It's nice, but a bit more would have been expected.<br /><br />It may comment on the lack of communication between cultures and people, but \\"Babel\\" is so compelling in its acting and visuals that it could easily have been a silent film.

0875428940|3.0|I'm sure this deck works quite well for some people. It's popular, that's for sure. It was the first deck I ever had a reading done for me on, and I've seen it everywhere (even being used by a public reader in Bangkok, Thailand). However, if you like weight and personality to your cards - this isn't it. They are well made cards and the artist's work is not unpleasing, but there is simply no character to them. The work is flat and uninspiring with no interpretive nature. Good for an absolute beginner or someone who wants to read publicly, but don't go into this purchase expecting a solid primary deck out of it.

Ray is sitting with his wife Annie, played by Amy Madigan (Carnivàle), wondering why he built this field, when his daughter Karin, played by Gaby Hoffman (Uncle Buck, Volcano) and says \\"there is a man on the lawn,\\" and there he was, Shoeless Joe Jackson, played by Ray Liotta (Goodfellas, Identity) and begins to play baseball with him.  Shoeless Joe then tells Ray there are others and next we see there are 9 players enjoying the game.      But the voices don't stop and Ray goes on cross country journey to find Terence \\"Terry\\"   Mann played by the great James Earl Jones (Star Wars, The Lion King) who in his legendary voice preaches a great speech about Baseball.  Upon finding Terry in Boston, he and Ray, travel to Minnesota to find Dr. Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham, played by Hollywood Legend, Burt Lancaster.   Everyone one has a dream or wish in the film and in the end on this field, dreams do come true.      As for the technical aspects of the DVD, the colors are bright and vibrant and the sound is crisp and makes you feel like you are right there, which is everything you expect from HD-DVD.  There are not many special features but the one include are entertaining and interesting.  Some the special features are \\"From Father To Son, Passing Along The Pastime\\" (great feature); deleted scenes; feature commentary; roundtable with Kevin Costner, Bret Saberhagen, George Brett and Johnny Bench; Galema, IL pinch hits for Chisholm, MN; The Diamond in the Husks (another great feature about the movie site and how it truly is a Field ofDreams; Bravo Special: From page to screen; and The Field of Dreams scrapbook.    As I mentioned above, I am glad I finally watched this great movie.  If you have never seen it or haven't seen it in HD-DVD, rent it or buy it.  Whether you have a regular DVD player or getting the HD experience this great film will last the test of time because at Terry Mann says \\"there is always one constant in life...BASEBALL.\\"   In closing, go out and buy yourself some peanuts and crackerjacks and get your copy of Field of Dreams, cause this HD-DVD is a grand slam.
0738702994|2.0|I haven't even used these yet, and I bought them months ago. I should have listened to other reviewers, because the cards are quite flimsy and the deck is so slippery because of it! However, the illustrations are beautiful, and so is the bag. Just like buying jeans or shoes, it's tough to find the right fit online - I would recommend to avoid buying tarot cards online unless you've actually handled the particular deck you're interested in.
B000P6PVLC|4.0|Unlike the \\"in your face\\" type of stories that permeate Hollywood, this story of misunderstanding and the cultural divide in human beings across different continents is a subtle and weaving story with emotion and feelings to it.    The tile itself is a subtle link to the myth of the Gods separating man with different languages and creating an artificial barrier thru language and culture. And it is this cultural divide that the director so eloquently brings out in the story.     The acting by Brad Pitt is great - but better is the Nanny who takes care of the children but ultimately is deported to Mexico because of the Diplomatic and political after effects of jeopardising American children to harms way. And in distant Africa (Morocco) another family is torn apart by the tragedy of a childish mistake which is thought to be an act of terrorism, thus bringing in its wake more misunderstanding and death.    A great movie for the thoughtful mind. Something to chew over long after the movie is over.
B000HKW7E0|1.0|Nothing against the movie, but after nearly 3 days, the download had gotten no further than around 20%, even with a high-speed cable internet connection.  I suppose I could have requested a refund of the $2.00 that I paid, but why bother swapping emails with some customer service person at Amazon?
0743454537|3.0|Quite a page turner but I could have done without the individualized print for each character's voice (were her words not vivid enough to convey each character's voice so that someone had to come up with the clever idea to differentiate between characters with different fonts?).  It's a good enough book for a discussion group - very thought provoking - but ultimately one that gets passed on to the used book store.

B000P46QIG|5.0|Theres not enough cliches to describe the level of depth and virtuosity that this band has attained. Virgil gets the MVP award in my book. His playing is simply beyond everyone else on a drumkit. His compositions are futuristic and mind bending, both literally and metaphorically. Every player in the band is at the top of his game, Quantum will be THE CD that will make waves in the prog/metal universe this year.
B0009K7ESW|5.0|This is an example of the transcendency of J. S. Bach.  I have read various critical reviews of this DVD and actually agree with some of what is said.  Truly I did not know what I was purchasing--actually thougth it was all Yo Yo and Bach, but it is more like a documentary.  Fortunately there are intact performances of each suite contained in this lengthy DVD.  The menu screen is very confusing and difficult to navigate--that is the only negative I find.  Otherwise I see no harm, and only inspiration in comparing and performing Bach's music to our surroundings, architecture, and the visual arts.  Yes, Yo Yo could have used other examples for comparison, but I do not disagree with the validity of what is stated--some reviewers have called his integrations random, I respectfully disagree.<br />The perfomances are clean and there are obvious changes of scenery during certain perfomances that required dubbing.  This was done flawlessly and with taste.  Overall this was fun and transcendent.  I suggest listening to other artists perform these suites.  Casals, Rostropovich, and Lynn Harrell all have recordings, and each are different.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The Rolling Stones and their guests made a great one with Let it Bleed. Keith is at his best, His song Silver is one of the best.

Bobby Keys has a good solo on Live With Me. Ry Cooders mandolin is good on Love In Vain. Mick is great on here his vocals are great and good harmonica on Midnight Rambler.
074356619X|4.0|The Secret was very interesting.  I got the unabridged, 4 CD Set, so listened to it in the car during a recent trip.  I have a hard time thinking that I can to anything by just thinking I can, because I know that it also takes a lot of work, but it sure did help in the positive thinking area.  Anyway, I enjoyed it and am trying to put some of it into practice.
B00005JPAO|1.0|The actors are solid (though Mirren has been better elsewhere and really doesn't accomplish all that much here) but the script is thudding and obvious to an insulting extent, the direction is uninspired (my favorite moment of the film - a title tells the viewer it's \\"Thursday\\" and then a newscaster on the television does so AGAIN 2 beats afterwards), and the theme, such as it is, probably too trivial to bear the weight of 90 minutes.   I'd pick on the symbolism, but it's not really accurate to call that 14-point stag a symbol - more like a thematic bludgeon that the film wields with overwhelming artlessness.  Every scene's \\"point\\" is triple underlined and the dialogue is painful.  Tony Blair's defense of the queen is so awkward as to be laughable - and that's a \\"climax\\" of the film.  It's impossible to believe the man who pulled Britain kicking and screaming into Iraq (for better or worse) is as weak as he appears here.  As for Charles, it would be hard for a viewer unacquainted with his sordid story to even know he ever loved another woman than Diana.   This will be generally declared unwatchable in ten year's time. It's all telling, little to no showing, and simply a very poor film.
0553296981|5.0|The basic outline of Anne Frank's story is well-known.  A young Jewish girl was forced to go into hiding with her family and others during WWII in occupied Amsterdam.  After two years of concealment, they were betrayed to the Nazis.  Anne died in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen before her 16th birthday.  She is generally seen as a figure of pity.<br /><br />This was one of those books that I always meant to read and now, having finally gotten around to it, I find myself privileged to have met such an extraordinary person.  After such intimate contact with her most private thoughts, it really begins to feel that she someone with whom I have spent some time.  Anne was a talented writer, even at the ages of 13-15, and her diary presents a full portrait of a complex human being, not merely a noble sufferer.  The nobility is certainly there, especially in the later entries, but so is the peevishness and self-centeredness of the teenage years.  She presents her inner world so clearly that it becomes plain that the world lost a great voice and perhaps a great author when the Nazis murdered her.  This document is one of the greatest indictments of the Holocaust.

B000QGAU4E|1.0|This was a waste of money.  I don't discount the fine acting talents of the stars, but it was a depressing story, no matter who was starring in it.  I thought there would be some hope, but the ending was too ambiguous and the whole movie was dark and depressing.

1596912375|5.0|William Boyd's \\"Any Human Heart\\" is a modern classic and a revelation - one of my best reads ever - and his latest novel, \\"Restless\\", is irrefutable evidence that Boyd is a huge talent and clearly more than equal to the task of tackling different genres and coming away with winners all the same, and  firing from all cylinders. Deservedly, it went on to win the 2006 Costa Book (formerly Whitbread) Award but was inexplicably ignored by the 2006 Booker committee in a lean year if the horribly patchy shortlist is anything to go by.     \\"Restless\\" is a set in World War Two spy thriller that rivals the best of the genre. Eva Delectorskaya, a Russian emigree recruited into the British intelligence service to spy on the Germans in the late 1930s, now lives quietly in the English countryside under an assumed identity with a family, including a grown up daughter (Ruth Gilmartin) and a grandson, in tow. They and her deceased husband know/knew nothing of her past but after all these years of living a normal life, suddenly there's one final thing she desperately needs to do for herself, something that would entail her coming clean about her secret past life with Ruth and risking the only relationships that are real and matter to her.      The novel has a two-tier time structure - \\"now\\" in the fore and \\"then\\" in the back - and while it's almost inevitable that the back (spy) story should provide most of the excitement, and the thematic and narrative drive, the story in the foreground isn't simply a device or an excuse to take an excursion into the past. I won't spoil the fun by saying more, except that the two stories dovetail in a marvelously crafted climactic encounter that won't disappoint.     Boyd is also a master of characterization. Eva's training as a spy for the British intelligence has taught her to trust no one. Not even her loved ones must know as the stakes are high. To live with this secret must be intolerable with nobody to share it. Yet her ice cool steeliness inthe face of present unidentified danger masks a deep love for her daughter. With an undisclosed former spy for a mother, it's not surprising that Ruth's relationship with her mother isn't close or intimate like the one she shared with her deceased father. But that's fine and the relationship survives. Lucas Romer, Eva's boss and some time lover during the World War years is another key character that's brilliantly drawn and finely etched in our minds.     William Boyd's fictional prose is some of the best I've read. It's as intelligent and finely nuanced as any in the canon of contemporary literature. His writing is right up there with Ian McEwan, John Banville and Julian Barnes.     \\"Restless\\" counts among my best reads this year. Highly recommended.
0385512058|5.0|I ordered this book soon after it was published, because I heard so many good pre-publication reviews.  It has now sat on my reading stack for several weeks.  I am sure glad I pulled it from the stack and started reading it.<br /><br />I actually started in earnest last night about 10:30 and by midnight, without having finished it yet, decided I had to review it this week.<br /><br />That's right, I am writing a recommendation for a book haven't finished yet.  It doesn't matter, because I got enough ideas and inspirations in the first 100 pages to pay for the book 100 times over.<br /><br />As of now, 9:20 the next morning, I have already successfully used two of the ideas and will have used several more before lunch.  I can't wait to finish the book tonight.<br /><br />It is a well written, easy to read book with great ideas and techniques.  Each idea is illustrated with a story.  And the philosophy of the book isn't about manipulation or complete self-interest - it is about service.  Ferrazzi explains over and over that the process of building your network of connections only works when your focus is on being of service to others.<br /><br />By the time you read this I will have finished the book and will have even more good things to say about it - but it doesn't matter - buy it for the first 100 pages.  The rest is a bonus.<br /><br />You can also read the author's blog  - [...]<br /><br />Written 5/2005
B000OCXMAE|2.0|If you like, Hibrid Theory & Meteora, don't buy this cd. Your opinion about Linkin probably change a lot. It's the worst material of them.  Much pop, much la la la, cero rock (the really rock). Linkin i'd like but the fussion of hard rock and samples, techno, etc. But the escent always did rock, fast music and good loud music, but this cd (snif, snif!) it's a really shame. \\"Please Linkin!!! tell me that the \\"martha steward\\" version of your cd and soon appear the really linkin cd!!!!\\"
B00008HCCF|4.0|This is a nice concert DVD, great talent/voice/music of Norah Jones, but the DVD is short, the actual concert is under 60 minutes. The two bonus items include an encore of a song from the concert and a music video...     One annoyance is that every time you put the dvd in the dvd player it automatically plays an annoying intro that has fans saying how excited they are to watch the concert. There is no way to jump away from this annoying intro. Bad dvd design!     Fans of the band \\"The Band\\" may like \\"the Band\\" reference/joke by Norah Jones.    The price of this dvd reflects the (relatively short) duration of the musical part and the lack of extra features, so one cannot really complain too much.    This is one of those DVDs that you can just set your dvd player to auto-replay and watch it on tv, or just listen to it through your audio system!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My product came in in record time and in perfectly new conditions. It was a good trade
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|The PQ of this movie is far superior to Blu-Ray, along with the added extra features that Blu-Ray does NOT have, it was a no-brainer to purchase this on HD DVD. Not only that, in the rooms of my home I do not have an HD DVD player, or at a friend's house, I can still play this in a regular DVD player.      Blu-Ray has more studios, but Disney and Fox, Blu-Ray's top exclusive studios aren't releasing anything.  Also, the Blu-Ray players beling sold now, aren't up to specs and will be pretty much obsolete by the end of the year.  They won't be able to handle all the features coming to HD discs, such as 300.
B0000640VO|5.0|A film of unexpected joys, random kindnesses, serendipity, random beauty, and the occasional indulgence in well-deserved revenge (but in a sweet way). There's more depth here than you might expect coming into it, but what it comes right down to is a lighthearted look at the little things in life that make it sweet.
B000005RTG|5.0|I believe that this Purple album was the most wide open and evenly distributed amongst the band members in term sof songwriting,music etc.  It showed that new directions were open for exploration and once Purple put their toes in they proved what a phenomenally adaptable and flexible powerhouse they could be.  It is not altogether a debate between the guitarist's but Tommy Bolin as the members og the band themselves have said brought well needed laughter and new ideas with him.  Of course as we all know he also brought a drug habit that would cause his passing at such an early age,and night sof brilliance followed by those of absolute averageness that the other memebers tried to cover,but could not given the state of Tommy's smack addled arm.  He also had a cohort namely Glenn Gughes who was on the slide chemically himself,so it makes it even more amazing that such a brilliant album cam efrom a band carrying so much negative luggage and Tommy Bolin also being given a contract that guaranteed some of his latest tracks from his solo work was given space in every performance and on the album.  So on top of the fact he was trying to step into Blackmore's not inconsiderable boots he was an American with a terrible drug habit and solo material that he could not possibly hop eto promote properly while with Purple,although of course being in Purple gave him the exposure that any musician would have dreamed of.  Do yourself a large favour and buy the rehearsal Cd's of Purple from this time which are awesome and also the superbly salvaged Days May Come put out by the ever brilliant Tommy Bolin Archives to get a taste of how great this band were live during thi sphase of Puple's existence.
B00007KQKM|1.0|While this adaptation did draw many good points from the story it was based on, it was very nearly ruined by poor acting. There just wasn't much chemistry between the two main characters, and many of the other characters seemed flat. Lady Chatterly herself ended up seeming somewhat frigid, which is certainly not what you would expect from an adulteress.   The format of a miniseries can be a good choice when there is a great deal of content to be conveyed, but this one just seemed to drag on and on. What should have been an enjoyable and thought provolking romp popping with chemistry and passion was turned into seemingly endless tedium. The one bright spot in the whole film was the scene where the two run through the meadow in the rain. For the first time, the viewer begins to glimpse some tenderness and joy, but it is quickly dashed, as that is the last romantic scene in the whole movie.  Good luck sitting through it. If you really want to experience this story as it should be, but without reading it, I suggest buying the audiobook.

B000PHX4VA|4.0|A perfect excuse to exploit their catalog again, A&M/Universal (or whatever the congolmerate is called now)has put together a terrific compilation of the band's album tracks and hits. It appears that the masters used for the album reissues from a couple of years ago are the source here as they sound excellent and exactly the same as the previous set. This is a huge improvement over the various single disc sets released since 1986.<br /><br />\\"Fall Out\\" was their first single and has only appeared on their four disc anthology on CD before this. We get 6 songs from the band's first album \\"Outlandos d' Amour\\" 4 tracks from their second album \\"Regatta De Blanc\\" their second album, 5 tracks from \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" their third album, 4 tracks from their fourth album \\"Ghost in the Machine\\" and a whopping 8 tracks (most of the album!)from \\"Synchroncity\\". We don't get anything from their soundtrack album \\"Brimstone and Treacle\\" (which includes the terrific song \\"I Burn For You\\") nor anything from their live album. Also missing are b-sides to most of their singles some of which are outstanding.<br /><br />With 14 songs on each disc there was some room for additional tracks some of which might not have been big hits but deserved a larger audience. \\"I Burn For You\\",\\"Bombs Away\\", \\"Darkness\\", \\"Nothing Achieving\\" and \\"Visions of the Night\\", \\"Low Life\\", \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" (which they are playing on the tour) are among the songs that probably should have been included.<br /><br />As mentioned the sound is very good on these discs although there isn't a mastering credit. It does sound very similar to the individual re-releases from a couple years back and has slightly better detail than the boxed set released 14 years ago. The later recordings benefit the most from the remaster although all the songs sound fine. It would have been nice to have comments for each song and more in the way of liner notes on the recordings but that doesn't detract from this anthology. I suspect that there are rarities out there (such as demos, etc.) that could have been added to entice fans who have their other releases but none are here.<br /><br />This is a very good set for fans looking for the bulk of the best album tracks and hits. The packaging includes a one sheet with some credits on it that folds out into a replica of an early concert poster for the band. The slip case is kind of cool as well. When you slide the holder out of the slipcase the band's songs are listed on the yellow cover (and you can see them when you hold it up to the light).ities out there (such as demos, etc.) that could have been added to entice fans who have their other releases but none are here.

078681859X|4.0|In Stroud's alternative London, magicians rule the country as members of parliament and they have their own invisible army of imps, marids, afrits and djinns. As in every magician society, there are apprentices and masters. One of these apprentices is named Nathaniel. Nathaniel always studied hard and did his best. Nathaniels life changes though when an arrogant, mean-hearted magician named Simon Lovelace humiliates him publicly by hanging him upside down while poking him in front of everyone and his own master fails to defend him.     This humiliating experience enrages Nathaniel and sets him on an irreversible course to summon a djinni named Bartimaeus to help him exact his revenge. Nathaniel commands the djinni to steal the arrogant magician's most prized possession. Unfortunately, lots of things can go wrong with magic, and they certainly did for Nathaniel, his master and Bartimaeus.     Somewhat derivative and cliche, still a fun read. My eldest (15) enjoyed it, but I wouldn't let younger children read it due to some of the mature themes.
B000005DQR|5.0|Listening to this now sounds pretty much like it did listening to it when it was first released. And that will be over ten years ago.    I try to avoid cliches but sometimes they are exactly that for a particular reason. In other words they're right. Okay, this still sounds like music beamed down from above. It sounds other-worldly, it sounds elsewhere...very, very different.    One of my friends is almost exclusively into dance music, has seen DJ Shadow live, and yet still can't quite get into this. My own take on it is that it's a DJ album you can't actually dance to. I mean you could if you wanted to but that's not quite the point. It's far more important than that.    It's just the sound of it all. And this is bass-heavy sampled heaven. 'Building Steam With A Grain Of Sand' builds to a scenario where it sounds like the tinkling ivories are battling the angels of heaven or your imagination whereas 'The Number Song' sounds simultaneously like it's old school excitement, something approaching the here and now, and the very future. Scratching and the skattering, clattering drums. Just excitement. And things like trying to remember that this is all sampled music. It is not live. Just very much alive. 'Changeling' has swampy drums drowned in some muddy production before it takes off and that scratching arrives followed by that bass and then...    Listening to this now I'm struck by how fearless it is, how it taps into a neglected part of you. How it just is. How I struggle sometimes to believe there could actually be a mass market for this. For something this challenging.    You may want stand out tracks but if that's the case, i think I'm struggling. Music this spontaneous (and yes, I know it isn't and there's the trick, the very height of the artistry here...)washes over you as a whole. You feel it or you don't but you hardly worry about which track you're listening to.    Having said that though, if you did want moments, that tension in music when things just work,then you might, just might go for 'Stem/Long Stem'. It soothes and then it builds and then...    'Midnight In A Perfect World' is possibly the most perfect song title ever but i'm still stunned that the song itself doesn't disappoint. A most mellow start until the drums arrive but then keyboards soothe and soulful vocals double that effect. An undercurrent of scratching and repeated mantra-like vocals. Midnight. Midnight. Midnight.    I'm probably more stunned though by 'Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain'. That bass. That bass...And then those drums. And the spectral keyboards at the end. Where does he get all this stuff from? And what happens next? And it goes without saying that we will never have an inkling as to how he then does what he does and makes it all fit together.    'What Does Your Soul Look Like' is definitely the most perfect song title ever and as a song surfaces twice here. You decide which version you prefer.    When people talk about an album being groundbreaking they usually mean 'worthy' and not necessarily something you'll want to listen to over and over again. This though is groundbreaking in the real, the true sense of the word...things beyond. Just listen and expect to be swept away.    The beginning and the end of something not yet heard.

B00005JJX8|4.0|Hitchcock and Cary Grant bring their customary magic to this stylish and frothy thriller-cum-romance. While this film may certainly be more to the taste of the female half of the population than the male, Grant's debonair ease and the suspense involved in cat-and-mouse game between police, suspect, and real thief is enough to keep anyone interested, and the snappy dialogue between the main leads anchors this well-made film. There's neither deep passionate romance nor spine-tingling suspense, making the film lack that quality of being truly great, but it succeeds very well at what it attempts - to be a light and very fun theft/romance film with a touch of Hitchcockian darkness.

B000OCXF0Q|2.0|The Best Damn Thing by Avril Lavigne is a sad and pathetic album. I liked Avril's Let Go and Under My Skin discs but her third album is as silly as the title itself. I think Avril has a wonderful, strong voice and an average songwriter but I don't know what has happened to her. I guess marriage softened her but this new bubble gum image and that blonde hair has got to go. She has so much talent and she's just throwing it away. It's so disappointing with lyrics like, \\"hey, hey, hey you I don't like your girlfriend, I think you need a new one...\\" Hopefully my little Candianan will knock it out of the park on her next album. Don't waste your time and money on this trash!
B000OVLBEY|4.0|I never saw Nicholas Cage as a comic book character! Hmm...if it was for the fake hair he might have impressed me! The movie is good. One man's quest to the best turns into a nightmare that only he can fix. He has to defeat the devil's son so he can defeat the devil. Eva Mendes heard it was a comic book made movie so she left her acting skills at the door. Other than that it was pretty good entertainment.
B00008438V|3.0|take a barbie doll, some weird gooey mess, a bit of electronic tinkering, two teenagers with bras on their heads and what do you get?<br /><br />You get Kelly LeBrock!<br /><br />That is the equation we are asked to accept in this cute and campy movie from the 1980's.<br /><br />This movie was made during the \\"Breakfast Club\\" and \\"St Elmo's Fire\\" craze, When all of your \\"Sixteen Candles\\" were \\"Pretty In Pink\\".<br /><br />It's basically Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink for Science geeks. A coming of age story about two nerds who can't seem to get a date so they decide to MAKE a date.<br /><br />Problem one with this movie? Two nerdy guys and one girl? They have enough problems getting women as it is. You'd think they'd at least want their own woman.<br /><br />But in the end, they get what they wanted all along anyway... real (if teeny bopper) love.<br /><br />And Kelly LeBrock goes back to wherever it is artificially-created model-type one-hit wonder movie babes go when they're no longer needed.... I think they call it Celebrity Fit Club.<br /><br />I rate this movie 4 stars for special effects...but honestly I gotta give it 3 for plot.<br /><br />I was a science nerd growing up and it was too weird for me even then.

6305910189|5.0|Right from a beginning that is as tense and shocking as ever there was in sci fi, to an ending that keeps you guessing while both pleasing and dismaying loyal Star Trek Fans, this movie was and IS an accomplishment to be celebrated.<br /><br />Star Trek the Motion Picture (movie one) was a less than pleasing transition from the small screen to the big screen. Wrath of Khan is not just a STEP up, it is a LEAP up.... it is LEAPS AND BOUNDS above its predecessor and dare I say the movies that followed.<br /><br />None of the series of movies had this level of conflict, tension and emotion. None had this amount of action and NONE... NOT ONE of them... had Ricardo Montalban!
0380789035|5.0|amazingly smart.<br />Imagine all of the gods ever dreamed up by man-- all existing together in our world. Now imagine that the old gods are losing power and actually disappearing as their believers and followers dwindle, while the new gods (money, media, internet) are thriving and taking over. There will be a war of the two houses, with man in the middle!<br />Neil Gaiman's imagination is intelligent and edgy.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|I love listening to this CD while playing video games or driving in my car. The songs are a bit more complex than the first CD, and Amy has developed her range and her belt (chest) voice a bit more than the first CD, so this one has a slightly different feel to it. I do like the simplicity of the first CD though, and I think the songs on the first CD are more catchy and memorable... but if you love Evanesence, you gotta get this CD too.     I think my favorites are Lacrymosa (because I sang that song in highschool and her rock version is brilliant), Call Me When You're Sober, and Lithium.
0060853980|5.0|Who'd have thought a book about the apocalypse could be so funny?!?  An angel and a demon have been living on earth since creation, and have grown quite accustomed to earth's luxuries.  Now, with the birth of the anti-christ (who has been misplaced), the end is unstoppable-- or is it? If these two have anything to say about it, life will go on!
1594489505|5.0|-\\"One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.\\"  This was another fantastic book by Hosseini.  To me, he is one of the best story tellers ever.  This book was the story of Mariam and Laila.  The first part is about Mariam who lives with her mom in the hills looking over Herat, Afghanistan.  Her father Jalil, was not married to her mother, but he would come visit Mariam once a week.  She lived for these visits.  Her mother was a bitter woman but loved Laila.  One day, Mariam runs off to find her father and is gone over night.  When she comes back to the \\"kolba\\" her life is changed forever.  The second part is about Laila and her childhood.  She lives with her mother and father in Kabul.  She is very good friends with a boy in her neighborhood, Tariq.  During this time of her life, Kabul is going thru some significant changes which prompts her parents to decide to leave.  The day they are leaving is a day Laila will never forget.  And this day brings the two women, Mariam and Laila together and they will develop a relationship that helps them get thru some of the worst times in their lives.  I read this book so fast because I was so engrossed in the story and couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.  I was teary eyed and smiling sometimes at the same time.  I can't say enough about this book and it's author.  It is just as good as, if not better than  The Kite Runner which is another one of my all time favorites.
B000H305U0|5.0|I must say that I was very surprised that the whole CD was unbelievable... not just tracks Sexy Back and What Goes Around that is now being played in most radio stations.  Every song was amazing, with great lyrics and jammin' beats.  It just underlines and reiterates the incredible artistic tales of this dude.  I will say that this is my first CD from him as I have bought only single tracks in the past - and definitely will not be the last.  Thanks Justin, for a totally kickin' and rockin' album.  LOOOOOOOVE it. Definitely blasting this on the way to Vegas!
B000025XKM|5.0|I consider this CD to be one of the highlights of my collection. I don't have a large section devoted to folk music, but this is so good that even casual music enthusiasts should give it a listen. It is somber and a bit haunting.  Nick Drake suffered from severe depression for much of his life and it definitely shows in this CD.  However, the music is magical in quality.  The guitar work is incredible and the raw melancholy of the music is beautiful. If you are looking for something mellow but engaging, you should give this a try.
B0002F6AH0|1.0|The miniseries was terrific but the DVD has one unacceptable (for me) flaw:  It has no provisions for the hearing impaired.  There is no closed captioning.  I bought this as a gift for someone who is hearing impaired and was forced to return it.      Such a cheap, shoddy decision for production is unworthy of the fine miniseries.
B000002QWD|5.0|This may be the most classic Christmas CD of all time. If you aren't familiar with it, you must have been under a rock for the last 50 years. If you don't like it, you should probably go crawl under a rock for the next 50 years.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|This, the second in the Jesse Stone series of TV movies, was actually the beginning of his adventures in Paradise.  It holds its place in the now four adaptations of the Parker novels, with a fifth in the works, and simultaneously begins and continues the development of the lead and supporting characters.  So long as the novels are adapted for TV, I'll watch, and so long as they're released on DVD, I'll buy.  All who read this, do yourselves a favor, and check them out.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly Clarkson keeps getting better. If you compare Clarkson to Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, don't.  She isn't pop. She's rock.  If you expect this album to be about love and puppy dogs, then you aren't going to like it.  Clarkson's lyrics are amazing, they're such a real portreyal of feelings. This isn't just another crappy pop album...this album is seriously amazing.  The production is amazing too.  The drums and guitar in some of the songs are just haunting, and I love Clarkson trying out a new sound on her last track (last two songs) Very cool, I hope this album does well because Clarkson deserves it! What a fantastic talent!
0553588486|5.0|If you like castles, knights and a good medieval adventure, this book is for you. One of the best I've ever read. The whole series is spectacular. Great, believable characters, real life situations, beautiful descriptions of the world Martin has created, historic details...I've read the whole series three times. I'll read them as long as he writes them. Lord of the Rings caliber writing, without copying a single element.
B0000630BT|5.0|After \\"Turbo\\" and the underrated \\"Ram It Down,\\" Judas Priest were slowly losing fans who longed for the classic sound from the older days. The infamous lawsuit involving the suicide of one boy in Nevada and the attempted suicide of his friend after listening to \\"Stained Class,\\" right after the Ram It Down tour, wore the band out, and longtime drummer Dave Holland left. The band's frustration at their quasi-decline and the public's negative stereotypes of Judas Priest and metal in general combined with the arrival of Scott Travis on the drum revitalized them.    \\"Painkiller\\" is my favorite Priest album. Not a mediocre song to be found. Scott Travis' incredibly fast drum technique allowed Priest to go in the speed metal direction much more than they could have with Holland. Just listen to the drum intro to the title track. That kind of speed combined with KK and Glenn's considerable shredding abilities allowed a ridiculously aggressive and heavy approach to this album. Then there's Rob's singing, which is sensational. Incredible screaming. After the title track, \\"Hell Patrol\\" and \\"All Guns Blazing\\" are good mid-tempo songs. Then the pace REALLY picks up with \\"Leather Rebel,\\" my favorite track, and \\"Metal Meltdown,\\" the envy of guitar players everywhere. Then we have \\"Night Crawler,\\" which is a catchy, chilling song, followed by \\"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\\" and \\"A Touch of Evil,\\" which string together nicely. I love the riff to \\"A Touch of Evil,\\" which is sort of a pseudo-ballad, but the aggression is there. \\"Battle Hymn\\" is to \\"One Shot At Glory\\" what \\"The Hellion\\" is to \\"Electric Eye.\\" Not a bad finisher. The remaster tacks on \\"Living Bad Dreams,\\" another song in the vein of \\"A Touch of Evil,\\" and a live take of \\"Leather Rebel.\\" It sounds a little disorganized and loses some of its heavyness, but that might be the quality of the recording (bootleg?).    Overall, a quintessential speed metal album and essential Priest album. Not to be missed by any metalhead.

B00005JPQP|5.0|One by one they creep up and will soon reach some magic number, though 13 is already interesting but more on the side of witchcraft than magic. The idea is always the same: to make a break-in or a burglary that is by principle impossible. In this case the impossibility is some extremely sophisticated digitalized security system protecting a casino in Las Vegas. How can a bunch of burglars manage to enter the system and pervert it in order to get even with the boss of that casino who was not honest with a partner that he forced into bankruptcy and retirement, with a good heart attack along with it. The vengeance is absolutely savage and wild. And that is absolutely brilliant, though of course impossible. The plot is just tinkering about to get to the target and objective and that is all. No real logic, no real meaning, no real believability. The more farfetched, the better. And more than farfetched it is at times. And yet here and there, there is a punch-line or a remark that is tilting the scales towards some meaningfulness, like the strike in Mexico for a 3.5 dollar rise a week, but it is evanescent and quick, like a good big wink at the audience, if they are not too far gone away in their intellectual slumber. So the vengeance is of course consumed and reached totally. The bad casino boss is pushed down the stairs, loses five hundred millions and three or four sets of two hundred and fifty million dollar each diamond necklaces. All together he must have lost in about ten minutes something like 1.5 billion dollars. Funny but where is the moral of the story? The editing and the plot are a little bit slow and the film seems to be slightly sluggish at times. Apart from that it is pleasant entertainment.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
0452287588|5.0|I really enjoyed this book which brought me further into the awareness of staying in the NOW.  It is provocative and yet mind quieting for me to read his prose which comes across with such incisive clarity.  It is my wish that someday I could be in the author's presence.  I have learned much from him and I thank him.
033041836X|5.0|I had read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" also by Sebold, and although I thought it was an interesting concept, I didn't see what all the fuss was about.  So when an acquaintance suggested I read \\"Lucky,\\" I didn't run right out and get it.  But when I finally did read it, I literally couldn't put it down.      Sebold dives right to the heart of the matter-- her brutal rape as an 18 year old Syracuse co-ed by a stranger--  at the beginning of the book.  Her account is a detailed retelling of what occured fact-wise with a running commentary on what she was feeling and thinking as it all happened. You cannot help but feel you are there with her.  Only after she recounts the entire rape does she go back in time and let the reader know who she is, what kind of family she came from, etc.  She is a stranger to us as much as she is a stranger to her rapist and to the police who ultimately have to decide if they believe her story or not.  She is a rape victim first and foremost to us and first and foremost to herself for many, mnay years after the assault.  Unlike Kathy Dobie's book, \\"The Only Girl In the Car\\" in which Dobie ineffectively details her life prior to the gang bang that ultimately defined her, Sebold only lets us get to know her as a rape victim, and only lets us know her past as juxtaposed by her present reality.    The unbelievable twists and turns of Sebold's life following her rape feel like they must have been fictionalized, but alas, they are true.  She ends up running into her rapist on the street not once, but twice.  (The first time resulting in his arrest.)  Other things that happen lead Sebold into a life of despair, fearing she will always be a victim.  Strangely (or not so strangely), within that paradigm, Sebold ultimately even victimizes herself.    Where Sebold's memoir shines the most is how amazingly honest she is about the effects of the rape on her life and psyche.  Her life is forever changed and she candidly examines how friends, family and strangers react to her following her rape with the objectivity of a sociologist but also examines her reactions to how she is treated through the lenses of a keenly attuned rape survivor.  She doesn't paint a picture in which we should pity her though; she lets it all hang out, warts and all.  This book is not about throwing a pity party, it's about a woman who has been to hell and back and wrote a book about it.  It's about a woman who learned that denial and repression are not the way to deal with trauma.  It's about a woman who was raped and her struggle to not be defined by that rape.    This memoir is a must-read for anyone who has been sexually assaulted or raped or who knows someone who has.  And it's a should-read for everyone else.
0553381695|5.0|George R.R. Martin has written a superb sequel to \\"A Game of Thrones\\" with his \\"A Clash of Kings.\\" Each day I read \\"A Clash of Kings\\" I stepped into a world full of wondrous characters, immense conflict, unreal plot twists, and even a touch of heart.    Tyrion the Imp (a Lannister) has the unenvious task of restoring order to Casterly Rock as the King's Hand. Everyone around him, and even those of his own blood, plot against him. Only his cunning and intelligence save him from an early death.    By force Arya (a Stark) is being taken to the wall. She is asked to present herself as a boy and struggles with the idea of running away. Without any external help she can only survive on her instincts.    Sansa (a Stark) continues to be forcefully held at Casterly Rock as the future wife of King Joffrey. She still has ideas of knights and valor, but slowly they begin to crumble under the cruelty of her overseers.    Crippled, Bran (a Stark) lashes out as the Lord of Winterfell. He still has hopes of being a knight, but without the use of his legs and terrorized by direwolf dreams, it is unlikely. He wants to do right by his brother Robb who has proclaimed himself as the King of the North. It isn't until two friends visit Winterfell that Bran truly begins to see.    In the bitter cold of north, above the wall, Jon Snow (a Stark) and his fellow Black Cloaks search for any sign of life, any sign of his Uncle. But the search party slowly comes to the conclusion that they are not going to find his Uncle. They do start to realize that the stories of old are starting to come to life, the stories of wargs and shape-changers. It is then that Jon is tested more than he ever thought possible.    Racked with pain and sorrow, Catelyn (a Stark) tries to help her son Robb and his quest to claim the throne of the north. She offers him advice and strength in a time that she is emotionally crumbling. It is so hard for her to carry on, but she helps Robb as a messenger of peace and alliance to Lord Renly (one of the 5 vying kings). It is then that she witnesses an evil that changes the course of the war.    Davos Seaworth (a Stannis Baratheon man) has recently been awarded the title of Lord, but that doesn't stop the other lords from looking down their noses at him. He has an unbelievable amount of loyalty to the self-proclaimed king Stannis Baratheon and helps his lord see the light even when darkness surrounds him in the form of a lady in red.    Theon Greyjoy (Prince of the Iron Islands) returns home after years of being a ward in the House of Winterfell. He has dreams of being a king, of ruling a mighty castle, but his missteps and blunders along the way will prove too much to overcome, especially when his sibling proves to have more guile and cunning.    Daenerys (exiled Queen) flees from the other khals, but without any direction or enough supplies. She is losing her followers and hope is slowly fading. How is she ever going to win back her kingdom with baby dragons, no army, and no ships?    While the conflicts enflame, a red comet is blazing across the sky. What it means, no one knows.     The reading flowed off of the pages and brought the book to life right before my eyes. Looking back I only wish I could have read faster. George R.R. Martin received much praise for \\"A Clash of Kings\\" and it was rightfully deserved. Everyone enjoy!
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins has thoroughly confused the contamination of mankind by man-made religion with the personal experience of God. I agree 99% with his opinion of religion (compelled behavior modification). However, he is simply too intelligent and educated to have innocently missed what many people who are less mentally endowed can readily see. So I hereby regard him as writing for profit by choosing the title \\"God Delusion\\" instead of the more appropriate \\"Religion Delusion\\". The latter title would not have sold nearly as well.     On the matter of delusion itself: That is an epiphenomenon of one's own state of mind and choices for which we are each responsible. Like many, Dawkins has obviously resisted seeking spiritual experience and that which catapults a person into a life of peace and \\"Eureka!\\". For those that do, no book can be written to explain it.    I gave the book 5 stars to hopefully encourage people to read it and see for themselves what sort of thought system to avoid, because it really is an excellent, superb example of a delusion after all.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|\\"Because you are fond of fairy tales,\\" Beatrix Potter wrote to one of her favorite children in 1901, \\"I have made you a story all for yourself, a new one that nobody has read before.\\"<br /><br />Now, a century later, \\"Miss Potter\\" (directed by Chris Noonan, starring Rene Zellweger) has a new story to tell, and quite a fairy tale it is, too, with all the delightful magic of one of Beatrix Potter's own stories: winsome characters, luscious settings, strong period details. I was charmed by this film (viewed on DVD, with all the extras), and spent an enchanted evening watching it. As a movie, it is fine family entertainment--something that's hard to come by, these days.<br /><br />But the film has been widely billed as a biopic, and if you were looking for a story that's true to Beatrix's life, this one might mislead you. Richard Maltby (who wrote the script and spent some 10 years trying to get it produced) and Chris Noonan have teamed up to give us a lovely fairy tale, but one that is based on some fairly fundamental misrepresentations of Beatrix's real life.<br /><br />Take that elaborate Christmas party, for instance, in a festooned Potter mansion. This dramatically pivotal event could never have happened, for Rupert and Helen Potter were Dissenters who did not celebrate Christmas--much to Beatrix's disappointment, as a child longing for a tree and the trimmings. (In life, both the Potters seem to have been much more dour people than their on-screen representations.)<br /><br />Or take those childhood visits to the Lake Districts, which never happened either. The Potters holidayed in Scotland until Beatrix was 16. Which means that she could not have met Willie Heelis, who was nearly five years younger than Beatrix, anyway (not older, as the film portrays him). Oh, and Willie was the son of a rector and the Heelis family belonged to quite a different social class from the one in which Willie is placed in the film. More misrepresentation (although the on-screen Willie is a real charmer.)<br /><br />But the most unfortunate distortion of all is the decision to collapse the eight years it took for Beatrix to become independent enough to leave her parents. The film portrayed Norman's death as the lever that pried her from the Potters' grasp. Not so. Beatrix bought Hill Top a few months after Norman died in 1905, but did not leave her parents until 1913, when she married Willie. For eight long, difficult years, Beatrix commuted from her parents' home or holiday residence to Sawrey. During that time, she could get away only five or six times a year, sometimes for a few days, sometimes for as much as a fortnight. Norman's death was indeed the prod she needed to make a change, but it wasn't until Willie offered her another choice that she was finally able to free herself. Compressing this long-running family conflict into a matter of months and hinging the whole thing on Norman's death distorts Beatrix's character and makes her seem more decisively \\"modern\\" than she was in real life.<br /><br />As a novelist engaged in creating historical fictions (some of them featuring Beatrix Potter), I am always aware of the challenges of representing real people in fictional contexts, and worry when real lives are seriously distorted to make a story more entertaining. I enjoyed this film as a film, and give it five stars for its entertainment value. As a biopic, I'd give it a two, three to be generous. Putting the two together, a four-minus.<br /><br />Oh, and for the real story of Beatrix's life, you'll want to read [[ASIN:0312369344 Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature]] by Linda Lear.<br /><br />Susan Wittig Albert is the author of The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter: [[ASIN:0425201015 The Tale of Hill Top Farm (The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter)]], [[ASIN:0425206130 The Tale of Holly How]], [[ASIN:0425215067 The Tale of Cuckoo Brow Wood (Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter Mysteries)]], [[ASIN:0425216551 The Tale of Hawthorn House: The Cottage Talesof Beatrix Potter]], and four other forthcoming novels in the series.eries.
B00009Z576|5.0|People shouldn't diss this album.  It's actually one of Yes's better efforts, certainly better than the post-90125 stuff ever was.  Jon Anderson left the group here, but the rest of the band showed that Yes was indeed a communal effort, as Squire, White, Howe, Downes, and Horn really come together on this album.  This album has 3 bonafide Yes classics.  There are 2 epics, Machine Messiah and Into the Lens, which are as good as anything they've ever done, and the album's closer, Tempus Fugit, which is a cross between The Buggles and prog rock.  Trevor Horn sings very well, even though he doesn't sound like Anderson (but, to his credit, he doesn't try).  The subsequent tour for this album didn't go too well, as many fans (especially in the U.K.) resented Horn because he didn't sound like Jon.  Trevor went on to be a producer (co-producing 90125, among other projects), and Downes went on to form Asia.  This is a great album, one that is unjustly trashed.
B000LC4TJ0|5.0|Ignore unfair comments to this masterpiece. Listen to it twice and pay attention to the words, music and acting. It is Mozart´s music with all its beauty where everything fits (words, singing, music, feelings). In Harnoncourt´s Figaro all music is sublime.   Harnoncourt is the only person that can afford to take risks, playing the opera a bit slower is a great decision. This is perhaps shocking in the First act. But listen (or watch) the second and third act to appreciate Mozart´s music at full extent and realize why Harnoncourt is one of the greatest conductors alive.

0440234743|5.0|On the surface, this book is about an eccentric billionaire who leaves nearly all of his fortune to his only illegitimate child, a daughter, who happens to be a Christian missionary and doctor working with primitive Indian tribes in a remote Brazilian rainforest. Of all his children, he knows her least of all, having distanced himself from her decades earlier when she was ending her teenage years. To those of his remaining children whom he knows far more intimately, he bestows comparatively little. He detests them and has spurned them for multiple reasons: each has squandered millions of dollars already, each is heavily in debt, and each is leading a selfish and contemptible life.     Since John Grisham typically writes books about lawyers, we as readers get to learn much about wills and testaments (hence the name of the book) and trusts, and it's all rather interesting. As a reader you will be privy to intimate details as to how big law firms handle contests of wills and how certain trusts may be established. These elements give the novel a certain legal flair that is evocative of Grisham's works.     But beyond the surface story line, we as readers get drawn into the thoughts and attitudes and behaviors of the main characters, who range in profession and lifestyle from ultra-rich professionals to petulant trust-fund kids to high-stress white-collar types to third-world missionaries and tribes people living in the simplest of conditions.     Few would argue that the main character in this novel is not the billionaire himself, nor any of his children, but the troubled lawyer who is hired to track down the heiress in one of the most remote and uncivilized places on earth. His thrilling adventure to locate her encapsulates much of the heart of the book and provides vivid insight into what it must be like to trek deep into an inhospitable and wild jungle.     The lawyer's name is Nate, and what a wonderful character he is. Full of doubt and deeply flawed, I came to appreciate his humility and sincerity as I witnessed his transformation from a troubled alcoholic and drug addict to a dependable and resolute father and law professional. Fraught with the pressures and long hours that come with being a high-dollar attorney, Nate let his profession get in the way of his family and health. We learn that often he turned to liquor and drugs and infidelity to cope with his high-anxiety life.     Upon being sent into the Brazilian wilderness and upon meeting the lovely Rachel, the multiple-billion-dollar heiress, something changes in him. We watch as his Christian faith and associations with deeply good and helpful people change him into a truly loveable character. This is a wonderful book.     I especially appreciate John Grisham for his high moral standard. One need not worry about reading profane and vulgar language on every page with Grisham. In my opinion, many modern writers appear to have some misguided profanity and vulgarity agenda, mistakenly believing that tense situations and dramatic effect can't be created without extremely offensive language thrown into the mix.     Grisham writes a masterful work, with beautiful characterizations and moving situations, without offending his readers with the use of base and distasteful dialogue. I truly appreciate that. I highly recommend this book.
0316067598|5.0|The thing that kept going through my mind when reading this book is, these guys are like the modern version of the movie \\"300\\": Spartan warriors facing incredible odds. I feel very lucky to live in a country (the U.S.A.) that can still produce young men like this. These men are the absolute best that exist, on all levels. The book takes us through SEAL training and BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition) training, and then onto Afghanistan, where the SEALS fight hardened Taliban and Al Quida terrorists. The SEALS tenacity is truly amazing, and their ability to continue fighting after being shot even multiple times is truly amazing. It shows how training determines how one will act in battle. Ultimately, this book shows what we are up against: hardened terrorists and fanatics with no pity and no idea of ethics (in the western sense). At the same time, our troops have to play by the most restrictive western standards of combat (defined by bureaucrats and lawyers). It is like warriors from the year 2005 (with all the modern ideas about ethics) up against warriors from the year 800 A.D. (with a medievel, primitive mindset). The book really shows, though, that the enemies of America constantly underestimate us. They always have, and probably always will. They think we are soft and weak. This book shows that we are not. Our young men from Texas, Nevada, California, Nebraska, etc. etc. are tough, ethical, and determined.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I was driving home one night, and I heard this song playing on the radio. It was epic, big, and unlike anything that I had ever heard. My wife said that it was from someone called 'My Chemical Romance.'<br />  I had heard of them, but I thought that they were some sort of punk rock band. I love alternative music, and hard rock. I grew up on it, however, I could never get into punk rock.<br />  I mentioned the song to someone at work, and they said that they had the CD, and said that it was great, and that I should try it.<br />  So I did.<br />  I was totally blown away by this album! There's not a song on it that I would skip through. From the opening lines of 'The End.,' to the almost inspirational chorus of 'Famous Last Words,' My Chemical Romance brings an album with a wide range of styles that all seem to meld into on fantastic album. 'The Black Parade' is one of the all-time greats, and 'Disenchanted' near the very end of the album really stand out as songs that could stand the test of time.<br />  This is an album that I could anticipate picking up ten years from now, and still like it as much then, as I do today. And THAT sort of album does not come along very often.<br />  So I say, that if you like music, any kind of rock music, pick up this album.

But outside of pure nostalgia, \\"Born to Run\\" is one of the premier rock albums ever in my mind. Bruce's third effort and first on a big budget, \\"Born to Run\\" captured people in 1975 with its good-time rocking music and lyricism that was all too real. But besides being a landmark triumph from a musical perspective, \\"Born to Run\\" accomplishes an amazing task by profiling the lifestyle of middle-class America in the seventies, surely making a grand statement. Bruce's depressing stories of the \\"losers,\\" the wage-laboring men and women who get their weekend kicks by driving cars, hitting the boardwalk, and struggling through relationships, are inspirational and moving to someone of any economic standing. But outside of the lyrical content, the songwriting is phenomenal. The verses, solos, hooks, instrumentals, are all perfect. This is the album, to me, where the E-Street Band comes out of the background (although you could certainly say the same about The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle). Clarence Clemmons' sweet sax riffs, Gary Tallent and Max Weinberg's valuable contributions, and Steve Van Zandt's backup guitar simply add to the perfect product that is \\"Born to Run.\\" The music is incredibly catchy, and each song in its own is a separate masterpiece.

If you own five music albums...make sure one of them is \\"Born to Run.\\"<br /><br />The first song is the rock n' roll classic \\"Born to Run,\\" where Bruce evokes the spirit of Roy Orbison to create a simply beautiful rock and roll song, undoubtedly one of the greatest ever.

The title song is certainly one of rock n' roll's finest, just a perfect song to me. \\"She's the One\\" and \\"Meeting Across the River\\" are probably the two lesser known songs from this album, but both embrace the musical and emotional spirit of the rest of the album. The final song is possibly my favorite, \\"Jungleland.\\" Simply an amazing rock song.<br /><br />If I haven't been able to express it to this point, \\"Born to Run\\" is a purely astonishing work of rock n' roll music that can be enjoyed on so many levels.

B00005JLZN|4.0|The Life of David Gale is a movie about the last days of David Gale, an anti-death penalty activist and college philosophy professor sitting on death row for the rape and murder of a colleague.  For reasons that are never entirely clear, he grants three doomsday interviews to a young, energetic, principled reporter named Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet).  Bitsey travels to Texas's death row to visit Gale in the last three full days of his life.  Gale implies that framing a liberal activist for murder is the ultimate triumph, and dangles before Bitsey clues to unraveling his innocence.  He doesn't want her to get him off in a last minute stay, but he does want her to keep his legacy alive and continue to research his case.<br /><br />The movie is no Dead Man Walking, nor is it a clear liberal rant against capital punishment.  It's a thriller/mystery that can be viewed as just that (with a few forced twists and plot holes), or it can be considered in the larger context of the debate over capital punishment in a death-happy state like Texas.  It's a movie about human foibles and their cost to our families.  Laura Linney, Kevin Spacey, and Kate Winslet deliver top notch performances.

I highly recommend this author if you love sci fi that makes you think, like if you're a fan Heinlein. Order it, you will not regret this purchase.
B0000009S3|5.0|A great majority of Frank Zappa's albums, masterpieces though they often were, tended to focus more on lyrical subversion and off-the-wall comedy than on the man's musical abilities. Which is an incredible shame when one considers just how gifted a musician Zappa was; the guy had an incredible knack for crafting tight, smart, and original melodies that were still incredibly endearing and catchy, as well as some uncanny improvisational skills that allowed him to create some of the greatest guitar solos ever played. As a writer and performer of music, Zappa was eclectic and fiercly original, taking as many cues from jazz and 20th Century composition as he did from rock, R&B, and Doo-Wop (the latter had always been one of his greatest passions) and combining them into a unique and virtually uncatogorizable sound that'll probably be inspiring artists and listeners for years to come.    Which is where this album comes in. Temporarily stepping away from the social commentary and envelope-pushing found on many of his other records, Hot Rots is a collection of instrumentals (with the exception of one vocal number, which I'll get to in a little bit). As such, it reveals the incredible nature of Zappa's musical skill. The opening number, \\"Peaches En Regalia,\\" is in many ways an ideal summation of FZ's appeal, with its playful melody, complex arrangement, and dazzling instrumentation. \\"Willie the Pimp,\\" the album's only vocal number, is another absolute classic: It's a pounding, greasy blues-rock classic, with a searing violin line (courtesy of Don \\"Sugarcane\\" Harris) and an absolutely nasty vocal from Zappa's longtime buddy, Captain Beefheart. However, the song's finest asset is an epic guitar solo from the master of ceremonies himself- at over seven minutes in length, it's an absolute monster, a blistering, brutal assault on the senses that spits forth burst after burst of hyperactive melody while somehow channeling the best aspects of both heavy metal and funk. It is, in short, a stunner, and an undeniable testament to Frank Zappa's unparalelled powers as a musician. Equally (if not more) incredible is \\"The Gumbo Variations,\\" a scorching jam that reaches nearly seventeen minutes in length. This one isn't even playful- it's greasy, mean, unforgiving, and explosive, a blues-soaked grinder that sees Zappa, Harris, and multi-instrumentalist Ian Underwood playing some of the greatest solos ever. On saxophone, Underwood is an inspired madman, palying some brilliant combination of free jazz and barroom rock, while Zappa and Harris maintain the mood with stomach-churning finesse. The other three songs on the album, while they don't match the heart-stopping power of the ones I've already described, are still fantastic: \\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\\" is a shape shifter with some wonderfully all-over-the-place soloing from Zappa and a melody that steadily ascends toward a glorious climax, while \\"It Must Be A Camel\\" is a dreamy, spacy piece with some apealingly off-kilter rhythms and a lulling piano line. The horns on the latter song are among the album's jazziest touches. \\"Little Umbrellas\\" is a tense, hypnotic number that constantly threatens (but never quite manages) to slip into discord and dissonance.     In short, Hot Rats is one of Zappa's greatest albums, a musical masterpiece that really should be in the collection of any real fan of music (no matte what genre it is).
1400079179|5.0|What some people miss is that this book is not trying to convince anyone of anything, it is simply a novel. It begins with murder inside the Louvre Museum in France. It turns out that Robert Langdon was supposed to have met earlier with Jacque Sauniere, the murdered man who was the curator of the museum. So Robert becomes the number one suspect. Enter the murdered man's grand daughter who warns Robert and the two of them escape and go on an info-hunt to find out what happened and why. I'll stop here so as not to spoil the story for anyone interested in reading it, but I will say that this is one of the few books that I liked so well that I went to see the movie and then also bought the dvd. It was spell binding and I didn't want to put it down, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.The only thing that I didn't care as much about was the ending,but the ending in the movie was better. With all that said, this is not really a who done it book, because you find that out at the start, it's more like how on Earth is Robert Langdon going to get out of this now?! Lots of twists and turns, this one,i'm keeping .
1582701709|1.0|After reading (drudging) through the first 20 pages I simply couldn't take it any more. In theory the idea of the law of attraction is a good one, logically known to most and a good reminder of being self-aware and simple common sense.    The way the information is presented is painful to read. The commentary notes as each person speaks is painfully repetitive and takes on a choppy cult-like cadence.     For those readers/reviewers that had an epiphany and may have experienced a life changing event from the words in this book... I'm sincerely glad. The message this book presents is positive one and, for this only, The Secret deserves an atta-boy.     Kudos to all the media frenzy and hype their marketing people generated for this book! Business well done.    Save your money, and do not buy this book... if you're overcome by curiosity, as I was, borrow it from a friend or your local library.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|I loved his first cd, especially Volcano. The lady who does the backing vocal stole my heart. The strings are simple and powerful. This cd seems to follow on the same path. It reminds me of a secret treasure not many folks know about. I am not sure why this man is not a major star, perhaps marketing, perhaps timing. His voice and talent are hard to deny. I will listen and continue to be a fan. As for the lyrics advisory, don't sweat it. You hear worse on CNN.
0330412752|2.0|DeLillo has a critical following, so I thought I would give him a chance by reading this short novel.  The novel explores a day in the life of a young Wall Street billionaire, Eric Packer.  DeLillo does a nice job of narrating the stream of consciousness of his protagonist and exploring his combination of narcissism and existential anguish.  What's missing is any sympathetic character who points the way toward a viable alternative to the bankruptcy of modern American life.  Another glaring, and perhaps fatal, weakness is DeLillo's inability to write dialogue -- a rather surprising deficit for a \\"modern master.\\"  DeLillo's descriptions of Packer's thinking and internal mental life are believable and sometimes compelling.  But what he says and what others say to him is wooden and so bad as to be laugh-out-loud funny.      I don't recommend this book.  I may still try to read one of his other novels, but this one is a clunker.

But, once I payed attention to the lyrics, I was appalled they were playiing this song at 1pm in the afternoon! This song is degrading to women - it promotes sexual violence and applauds a female who is submissive and has low self esteem. How can we as a society say it's okay for radio stations to play a song like this, especially during hours most children could be listening. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed in Nickelback for writing this song - as well as the new song \\"Rockstar\\". Shame on you guys. You may not have asked to be role models, but you are now. Show some integrity and live up to it.

1582701709|1.0|I bought this book because someone I respected recommended it. She and I will be having a little chat.<br /><br />The biggest problem of the book is its fundamental fallacy: in mangetism, likes do NOT attract. Opposites attract, likes repel. That someone who died as recently as 1949 could write that likes attract in magnetism, suggests that (a) someone slept through that entire section of high school physics class and (b) someone is making it up as she goes along.<br /><br />The power of thought is interesting and undeniable, but certainly not because it acts like a magnet. Have we all lost track of common sense?<br /><br />10/14/2007<br />Having now finished the book, I can confirm that it actually gets worse as it goes along. Its basic message is that whatever happens to you is your own damn fault. People are fat because they haven't been thiking \\"thin\\" thoughts. I'm sure the victims of epidemics, genocide, and natural disasters will be grateful to know that they could have avoided their problems by thinking happy thoughts. Basically, this is a particularly nasty take on positive thinking, backed up by a quasi-scientific attitude. Someone should remind the author that saying something doesn't make it so. The phrase \\"gross generalities\\" applies to nearly every page of the book.<br /><br />If you really want to improve your life, go with David Burns's \\"Feeling Good\\" and the other cognitive therapists. Burns's book is especially good as he backs up his conclusions with good, solid research and presents the actual statistics in footnotes so you can interpret the results of studies for yourself.<br /><br />While I am opposed to banning or burning books in general, I think \\"The Secret\\" is just mean, nasty, selfish, and wicked. It shouldn't be burned (partially because I'm going to make the anti-hero in one of my stories be a motivational speaker/huckster and this slop is a great resource), but it should definitely be boycotted. This book is one of the worst examples ofwarped reasoning I have ever seen. Avoid it like the plague.
0743277457|2.0|This book is a quick read. I enjoyed learning about Josh's life from his perspective and his adventures. The biography contains lots of Zen clichés (which never makes much sense coming from someone so focused on winning and achievement). I found some of the passages extremely egotistical.  I think I am more put off by the title and the promises on the book jacket and by the author. I think the title is terribly misleading. I think the book should be titled the Art of Josh. As an autobiography, it is engaging but as far as learning how to be competitive at extremely high levels...I don't think so. Perhaps these were my expectations when I purchased the book.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I picked up this album on the strength of Total Guitar having rated the solo in Bat Country so highly in their top 100 guitar solos article (and man I love that solo!) and without knowing anything else about the band at all.    One listen through and I was hooked. I really love the tight arrangements of the songs on the album, complete with fast dual guitar lines (Burn It Down sticks out in this regard!) and insanely brilliant drumming. The biggest appeal about this band is the diversity of their sound. Like several of the forerunners in Metal currently (Trivium, BFMV to name a couple) the guitar harmonies are undoubtedly influenced by Iron Maiden. But coupled onto this is an undeniable tip of the hat to the Gunners (you can't miss the similarities in guitar tones and licks played by Synister Gates in Seize the Day and Slash's work on November Rain)    My favourite song on the album is a tie between Sidewinder and Bat Country, but since most are going for Bat Country I'll promote Sidewinder!   My least-favourite number on the album is Strength of the World (that military shout of the chorus \\"Strength of the World\\" feels a little silly) but there are still parts of the song that I like.    There is no doubt that this is a guitar-purist's type of album, but the songs themselves are strong enough to be liked by people looking for more than just the next guitar solo. So now I sit waiting for the next offering by the band
B0000797IO|5.0|This is a wonderful black comedy about a woman who lives a dreary life working at a Wal-Mart type store and has a lousy husband who smokes dope all the time.  She finds romance at the Retail Rodeo with a 22 year old who fashions his life along the lines of Holden Caulfield, the protaganist in The Catcher in the Rye.  Everything seems pretty exciting and steamy until she becomes pregnant and motherhood looms.<br />This is a wonderful film and I loved it.  I was very impressed with Jennifer Aniston and never knew she was such a good actress.  This is not a film for most fans of Friends or of big Hollywood movies.  It is a lot more artful and very subtle in its humor.  This will probably be the film that will last and live on for her considering what she has been making lately.  A performance to remember.
075640407X|5.0|I've been reading science fiction and fantasy for over 45 years.  In the last several years, I've found it harder and harder to find a book in the genre that really holds my interest throughout, until last week when I picked up The Name of the Wind. It was perfect timing.  I was taking off a week for rest and relaxation and was ready to enjoy a good read.  And this one hit the mark.  While over 600 pages, I tore through the book in a matter of days, and  would run to the store for the second in the trilogy except it's not due out until next year.  Hard to believe this is a first novel. Certainly doesn't read that way.  It's engaging with great characters who are rich and believable while unique and refreshing. The story flows from one exciting episode to the next.  The world is believable and the magic well thought out, consistent, and believable.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a great story -- funny, touching, unpredictable, and just down right enjoyable throughout.
B000P2A256|5.0|This is what a new band should do(having only one previous album).  They stuck with the formula giving their fans what they wanted more of.  It is true that they, like every other musical act these days, took a long time to release new material.  But now they can develop and progress the way they want to.  I am so tired of bands \\"maturing\\" out of nowhere, coming out with music that sounds bad and believing they have the right to come out with music that isnt worth the amount of time they took to make it.      Now they have a great chance and have earned the right to come out with a concept album or try anything else that they want.  Well Done!
B000OCZ80Q|3.0|First, the bad. On my HDA2, this disc craps out with an error at 1:05 into the ballet. I'm not sure if this is a player error or a format/DRM/SW error. This is not the only disc/instance that reports of this error has been mentioned. Checkout avsforum for details. I hope a future firmware update would fix this.    Now, the good. Ballet is glorious in HD and the POB is one of the finest companies in the world. I had seen POB live in Paris so I was looking forward to adding this to my collection. POB dancers are not as spectacular as ABT dancers with their acrobatic turns and jumps. But, you can really see the solid technique in everything they do, which sometimes takes your breadth away. In some respects HD reveals too much detail that most live audiences would never see. Ballet technique is top notch but you start to notice the emotionless acting (especially with Jose Martinez). Video editing work could be alot better as camera changes were too often and erratic for my taste. I would rather include alternative closeups as bonus material. The music was wonderful but all stage sound were suppressed. Again, this is my preference for not over producing a live performance.

B000O1NJTO|5.0|Donald Fagen's 1982 solo debut extends the sleek, smart pop craft of his work with Steely Dan into the realm of the concept album, taking the Dan's penchant for intricate plotting, evocative narrative voices, and allusive imagery to the logical next step. Fagen's connective thread is futurist nostalgia for the \\"New Frontier\\" as anticipated from the prosperous vantage point of late-'50s America. He romanticizes a brave new world of technology in the sultry diorama of \\"I.G.Y.,\\" celebrating the coming glories of the Atomic Age. He then filters that view through his own suburban adolescence--a would-be seduction in a fallout shelter, the siren song of a graveyard-shift jazz DJ, a not-quite-hard-boiled noir adventure (\\"The Goodbye Look\\") that borrows its title from an early '60s Ross MacDonald mystery. Song for song, the set's a stunner and stands apart from Steely Dan thanks to a unique, poignant romanticism embodied in Fagen's yearning \\"Maxine\\" and a creamy update of Dion & the Belmonts' \\"Ruby Baby.\\" --Sam Sutherland     One of the Greatest Albums of all time - it has it all!  By  L.A. Scene            Ask those who follow the music industry closely and they will tell you that Donald Fagen's \\"The Nightfly\\" is clearly one of the great albums of the last 25 years. Currently there is an artist on the music scene named Norah Jones who has gained some fame with a retro/jazz sound. While Jones does a nice job on this, Fagan does it even better on this album. Donald Fagen's \\"The Nightfly\\" brings the jazz/blues sound to the forefront, but takes it a step further. \\"The Nightfly\\" also is a concept album. In the CD's liner notes, Fagen says that the songs on this album \\"represent certain fantasies that might of been entertained by a young man growing up in the remote suburbs of a northeastern city during the late fifties and early sixties\\". When you listen to the songs on this collection, you will easily see how the theme flows through - and as a result, this enhances the listening experience.     Fagen assembles an outstanding lineup of musicians to work with him on this solo effort. While Fagen plays piano and synthesizers on many of the tracks, he also gets some help from acclaimed keyboard player, Greg Phillinganes. Phillinganes is best known for co-writing on several albums with Lionel Richie. Phillinganes contributes keyboards on 6 of the 8 tracks. The late Jeff Porcaro - from Toto (ironically \\"Toto IV\\" won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 1982 and \\"The Nightfly\\" was denied any awards) contributes drums on 5 of the 8 tracks. Valerie Simpson - from Ashford and Simpson contributes some outstanding background vocals on 5 of the tracks. Finally, guitarist Rick Derringer is on 2 tracks. These musicians do a simply outstanding job at making this the great album that it is, however don't underestimate Fagan. Fagen's unique vocals and crooning style are the real star of this show.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|I almost can't help but come away from a viewing of The Fountainhead thinking this was a fine film for reasons other than its screenwriter and author, Ayn Rand, might have wanted it to be. Whereas the twentieth-century's most severe defender of a singular concept of self-interest and personal expression probably saw in her work a manifesto for the salvation of the creative caste in humanity's mostly wasted population, I liked The Fountainhead for the strength of its visual effects. If this means I \\"didn't get it\\" then so be it.<br /><br />This is an impressive movie with sound performances filled with anger, arrogance, megalomania, and an intentional stoical woodenness that was extreme even for Gary Cooper. I liked the shots of buildings worked into existing cityscapes, and the trouble the makers of this motion picture went to to bring Rand's visions to the screen. What I didn't feel was a lot of affinity for Rand's message or for the occasional melodrama that was exhibited by nearly all. This production was often like Citizen Kane meets Brave New World. Some of my friends say Ayn Rand is the greatest writer and visionary the planet has ever produced. I am less generous in my evaluation of her, but I still don't hesitate to say this is a good movie, worth seeing, in no way a waste of time, just not the classic I was led to expect it would be.
B000T9SK5Y|5.0|More hard-boiled tales from Tom Waits, who manages to sing lines like \\"Everyone I know is either dead or in prison\\" in a raw, whiskey-soaked rasp that sounds both comical and deadly serious. Waits doesn't break any new creative ground here, but continues to refine his down-and-out ham-and-egger persona. It's booze and broads, sex and violence, laughs and heartbreak. This 1978 album opens with an astonishingly desperate version of \\"Somewhere\\" (from \\"West Side Story\\"), performed like Louie Armstrong with a migraine. From there it's the usual Waits mix of crackpot wordplay and the cocktail lounge jazz likes of \\"Romeo Is Bleeding.\\" --Steve Appleford
B00005JPLW|5.0|I'm sure this will be lost in the sea of other positive reviews for \\"300\\" (which I'm not complaining about) but I'll throw in my two sorry cents.      Thus far in 2007 I've been to the theater 5 times.  \\"Spiderman 3\\", \\"Pirates 3\\", \\"Shrek 3\\", \\"Die Hard 4\\", and \\"300\\".      This movie was the only experience that actually astonished and excited me.  And don't be mistaken...I'm a fanboy among fanboys...and I'm sure I'll love all of the aforementioned films on DVD.     But as a theatrical experience that harkened back to my childhood---staring up at the screen with speechless incredulity at what passes before my eyes...\\"300\\" was everything and more.      BUY THIS MOVIE!
B000T9WBG8|5.0|The Eagles might have covered his song \\"Ol' 55,\\" but Tom Waits was cut from a different cloth than California's other singer-songwriters--he suggested a scruffy beat poet who'd walked out of a forgotten scene of Jack Kerouac's On the Road. Waits's beatnik schtick could get old, and he developed into a much more musically adventurous songwriter in later years, but his second album contains some of his best early work, including the sweet romantic blues of \\"New Coat of Paint\\" (\\"You wear a dress baby, I'll wear a tie\\"), and his best hipster recitation, \\"Diamonds on My Windshield.\\" Two songs are enduring classics: the doleful, dirge-like \\"San Diego Serenade\\" (\\"Never saw the morning till I stayed up all night\\") and the touchingly sweet \\"(Looking for) The Heart of Saturday Night\\" (\\"Stoppin' on the red, goin' on the green, `cause tonight'll be like nothin' that you've ever seen\\"). --John Milward
B000OCZBS0|5.0|Discovered Diablo Swing Orchestra while reading a random message board.  Gotta love them internets!  I checked out their myspace page, listened to \\"Balrog Boogie\\" and \\"Poetic Pitbull Revolutions\\" and I immediately knew I had to have this.  After listening to the whole thing multiple times, I am in love with this record.  It feels like music that would be released on The End Records - try and describe the elements that compose it, and you'll be sure to leave something out (like I will!)  I haven't had a disc dominate my player like this for a long time.  By that I mean needing to have it loaded onto my computer at both home and work, as well as carrying the disc in my car, so it's accessible at all times.  If I had an mp3 player that counter would be steadily climbing every day.    Everything you've read about the singer's voice is correct.  Operatic style.  I understand what people mean when they say it reminds them of Nightwish, but I hear it somewhat as Therion and (a little) Devil Doll - but it's really more its own animal than anything else, and meshes incredibly well with the music, as do all of the accompanying stringed instruments.    Some of these songs are almost pop in their addictiveness!  You'll have difficulty getting out of your head tunes like \\"Rag Doll Physics\\", \\"Wedding March For A Bullet\\", and \\"Porcelain Judas\\".   \\"Balrog Boogie\\" is the most jazzy of the tracks (along with the outro on \\"Pink Noise Waltz\\"), although the lyrics sound like random Latin phrases.  \\"Heroines\\" mixes in sultry slinkiness that reminds me of David Lynch.  \\"Gunpowder Chant\\" is a lengthy intro that leads into the techno-tinges at the beginning of \\"Infralove\\", where you'll also find guitar reminiscent of Vic Flick.  \\"Pink Noise Waltz\\" is a piece of art unto itself, and sounds like it could've been a missing track from Ayreon's Human Equation.    Any of you out there who aren't repulsed by operatic vocals and are tired of the same old thing - check out their myspace.  Find theirhomepage.  Do something!  Listen to as much as you can.  Absorb it into your auditory vocabulary and elevate your palate to another plane, should your tastes oblige.    This is like a DQ Blizzard of heavy metal.  You get a variety of musical treats mixed in with your metal ice cream to complement and play off of each other without losing its true flavor.  I hope their next serving is offered up with a dash of Mike Patton.    4½ stars (rounded to 5)
1416909532|4.0|This book was funny in some ways and serious in others. It certainly makes you think about stuff that is for sure. I bought it just to see what it was about and some of the sayings caught my attention. A great book if you have just broken up in a relationship or thinking of breaking up...it will make you think.
0440418569|2.0|While the His Dark Materials trilogy (of which this book is the 3rd part of) is some fabulous writing, I have to give a so/so rating only because of how strongly it conflicts with my beliefs.  The prose of these books is amazing, and the story races with intensity.  But the manner in which the author portrays the themes of the trilogy differs so much from how I would've done it, that I'm kind of upset that I read hundreds of pages to get to this ending point.      The main idea of what the books are truly \\"about\\" is that we must be open-minded, live good lives, and work hard.  I whole-heartedly agree with that.  But how does the story unfold to show us this?  It does so by making God (yes, THE God, Yahweh, the Ancient of Days) out to be the enemy.  It tells us that the Christian faith was a mistake and that the church has been forcing humans to close their minds from the truth.  There's even a point of dialogue when free grace is said to go away eventually, but it's ok because in the novels you can attain grace through a lifetime of good works.  The last sentence of this third novel tells us that we have to build the Kingdom of Heaven within ourselves.  And then we're told that we can even find purpose in life without God (as an ex-nun does in the trilogy).  I believe there's even a subtle theme of homosexuality between two low-ranking angel characters.  But the plot is epic and apocolyptic:  the third book comes to a climactic battle when the forces of evil that rebelled from God before the world began join together again to take on the Kingdom of Heaven again (and guess who dies?....the Almighty Himself).     If I were to attempt to find a way around this interpretation it may be this:  there's a need for a Savior, but no need for the Old Testament God.  The dead are set free (parallels Christ defeating death) and our main characters are taught about love for others and sacrifice (themes of Christ's teaching).  But still, at one point, Jesus' name is referred to,and it's by the nun who once gave her life to Him, but now is lost in the beauty of physics.      So while this was an entertaining read, I'm afraid I cannot give it a thumb's up.  If Pullman were to read the Bible and understand what Christ taught (as opposed to the church's history), then he'd realize that God is about love and caring for others... unfortunately we appear to disagree on this point.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|Unfortunately, this CD is much below all what one could expect from Norah Jones. Except the cover, nothing is worth remembering.
1400049628|5.0|Arguably, The Zombie Survival Guide stands as one of the most unique examples of horror literature written to date.  After reading this work, I was amazed with Max Brook's ability to dissect the zombie in such a dynamic and thought provoking manner.  These descriptives are normally not associated with anything called \\"zombie\\" - but Brooks make them quite applicable in his guide.    The scientific, historical, societal impact and threat of the zombie is examined in logical detail throughout this guide. Some of my favorite parts of the book were those involving the weapons & tactics used in dealing with the undead threat.  Most amazing in The Zombie Survival Guide is the underlying wit Brooks uses with no degradation of the fear inspied subject.    I am a long-time fan of the zombie horror-genre (25+ years), and have seen many works with potential miss the mark.  With The Zombie Survival Guide, Max Brooks hits the bullseye dead on (and in deference to Mr. Brooks, he is firing with his well oiled, primary firearm).    Other Zombie works that I would recommend:    [[ASIN:1419667483 Zombie Factory: 27 Tales of Bizzare Comix Madness from Beyond the Tomb]] - a collection of some the best zombie stories from the 1970's horror magazines.    [[ASIN:1560258500 Monster Island: A Zombie Novel]] - presenting one of the greatest zombie doomsday scenarios I have seen to date.    [[ASIN:1411608313 Day by Day Armageddon]] - another outstanding zombie novel - the cover says it all...One Man, and his struggle for survival in an undead world.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Very refreshing composition, nice voice, melodic, smooth, not too sweet. Music you want to listen again and again.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This special edition (2 DVDS) of Glengarry is superb. It has the widescreen and full screen versions as well as many extras. Be assurred if you have a multi-region player this is the one to get. I have watched the widescreen version and there is nothing wrong with the quality of picture.<br />Glengarry is a film about Real Estate salesman - sounds dull - it isn't. Its one of my favourite films and the cast all give stand-out performances:<br />Alec Baldwin has never been better than his cameo role at the start of this film. The part was specially written by David Mamet for the film version and was not in his original stage play.<br />\\"Always be closing!\\"<br />Al Pacino is as always excellent, and Kevin Spacey in an early role shows why he went on to become one of the top actors of the 90's.<br />However, Jack Lemmon tops them all. He plays a desperate man, and consequently resorts to desperate measures in order to try and remain top of the selling game. A marvellous performance that will remain with you long after the film is over.<br />This film doesn't have any special effects, explosions or super-heroes but I guarentee you this has more memorable scenes than any blockbuster you will watch this year.
B000P1KTW8|5.0|I will start by saying I have been a big Springsteen for years. Have seen 5 of his performances live and he never fails to blow you away, the same goes for this dvd. The video portion is as good as it gets for a music performance. They did a nice job with not jumping around too much with the cameras.  The performance itself was as good as anything he has done. You really get into the scene and the music, wanting to jump up and clap your hands to the rythyms. The sound, I'm running out of superlatives here but the 5.1 pcm was totally awesome, putting you write in the middle of the band. Instruments and vocals are clear and precise.   I'm a total pervert, I mean convert to this form of music and oh! what he does with his older tunes, he should do more. He turned Open all night into something sensational.  Well, do you think I liked it?  If you either like this type of music or are a Springsteen fan open to new sounds do not run but haul a-s and get buy.
B00004W510|5.0|With 3 Lead vocalists, that played more than half a dozen instruments between them. A lead guitarist and songwriter of the highest quality, and a multi-intrumentalist/keyboard player The Band were, and still remain quite unique to this day.<br /><br />This album still sounds completely original now. In 1969 it would have been from another planet. Everybody was into acid and anti-establishment, Flower Power, Hendrix psychedelia were hip then. The Band went backwards and embraced a bit of country, Ragtime, Gospel and Rock N Roll of course.<br /><br />Highlights - well the only only minor hit single they ever had \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" is a track that demonstrates their versitilty. Rick Danko (the usual bass player) is playing fiddle, theres some fiendish Piano Playing from Garth Hudson and virtually everybody is playing something different from usual.<br /><br />The other well known track is The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down (which sounds as though it was written in the 19th Century). This was covered by Joan Baez. However, my favourite is probably King Harvest (has Surely Come). Richard Manuels lead vocal is anguished, Robbies guitar solo, brilliant but understated. If you've seen the classic albums program on this album you'll understand.<br /><br />Believe it or not this album influenced Eric Clapton and Elton John. Hard to believe. When Clapton first heard this record he stopped wanting to be a guitar hero and wanted to get back to writing quality songs. Listen to Elton Johns Tumbleweed Connection album and it reeks of the first two Band records (and its a great album in its own right).<br /><br />Sadly Richard Manuel committed suicide in 1986, and Rick Danko died in the 1990's. We will never see The Band perform again in its original line-up and to me this is as sad as The Beatles never performing again after the famous roof-top concert. Thats how good these guys were. This album remains an essential purchase 37 years after it was released.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I have no idea what Jason Kirk meant when he said, \\"Minutes to Midnight stands to defend Linkin Park's status as the hardest-rockin' softies in mainstream music.\\" Well, he got the \\"softies\\" part right. Out of the thier three full, non-remix albums, Minutes to Midnight ranks a distant third.      I would concur with reviewers who say that Linkin Park have mastered the art of rap-rock. Their aggressive, in-your-face riffs can hang with the best. So, when \\"What I've Done\\" was released on radio, I, as a fan, was pleased. Not overly so, but pleased none-the-less.    The problem I have with this album is that it's too quiet. What I mean when I say that is that it's no-where near as heavy as their previous albums. The album has a total of 12 songs (11 really, as the first song is merely an intro). So, out of the remaining 11 songs there are a total of 4 \\"heavy\\" songs. Yes, that's right, four. And of those four, three are very good. \\"Given Up\\", \\"What I've Done\\", and \\"No More Sorrow\\". The fourth \\"heavy\\" song, \\"Bleed It Out\\" is just plain juvenile and I cannot believe a band of this caliber would record something so trivial and craptastic.     The remaining songs are, for lack of a better term, \\"ballads\\". Not that there is anything wrong with a good ballad, but come on! I mean, some of them (like \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\") are good but we just don't need seven or eight slow songs by a band that is capable of so much more.    Try this: Listen to the remaining songs (the non-heavy ones) and I guarantee that you will easily be able to envision someone like Avril Lavigne singing them.      If you're a fan, you have probably already bought this album.  For those that haven't, don't.
B000P0IW6E|3.0|Wow, I was excited for this new release because their last one, Unbreakable, was a real return to form---had all the rocking power, drama and fun of their 1980's heyday, with enough of a modern edge and production to still sound relevant.  So now I have Humanity - Hour 1 and have spun it 5 or 6 times and . . . hmmmh?  I can honestly say that individually I pretty much like all the songs, a few are real standouts, but I have to ask---WHERE'S THE STING???    The delivery here is so laid back and almost tranquil; virtually all the songs are mid-tempo to power-ballad to ballad.  \\"Hour 1\\", \\"3-2-1\\" and \\"The Cross\\" are pretty much the only tracks have any discernible hard-rocking edge (I can't even use the term metal) and unfortunately they are not among the album's strongest songs.  And I'm not one of those fans that has to hear super-fast or pulverizing songs to consider something good but, while individually good, taken together these songs are a bit of a snooze-fest, and that's so unlike the Scorpions.  It's strange, there's distorted guitars, some nice solos, and Klause's voice amazingly still soars with the best of them, but there is precious little real tension and power generated in many of the songs.  Overall it's got a very AOR or, dare I say, adult contemporary feel!    Spin this CD, or even the 1st 3 or 4 tracks, and then spin the 1st 3 or 4 tracks on Unbreakable and I guarantee the difference will jump out at you.  Perhaps it is the collaboration with Desmond Child and others that makes the difference?  I don't have a problem with the collaboration or with them going for a more contemporary, radio friendly sound---the Scorps have been a commercially oriented band since the start of the 1980's.  But from these guys who still put on one of the most  electric and intense live performances of any band around, I guess I just expect at least a good bit of any album of theirs to rock a little harder than this.  In fact, some of the songs on Humanity - Hour 1, if arranged or delivered slightly differently, could have had a much more powerful impact; so I can only guess they were really aiming for a much more sedate, truly pop rock vibe on this one.    Bottom line: individually the songs are all good to very good (and I can't say that about Unbreakable---which has a few clunkers---though I would have to rate that album higher on overall impact).  Listening to this CD straight through leaves me wishing for more . . . get's a bit repetitous with virtually all the songs in that slow-to-middling, just too relaxed vibe.    Despite some disappointment with Humanity - Hour 1, I can't wait to see Scorpions live again when they come around to support it.  With talk of their career winding down, it would be great to see them put together an album combining the consistent songwriting of this one with the power and energy of Unbreakable before they hang it up.
1401207529|5.0|The trade paperback edition of Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli's four issue Batman Year One run is like a remastered CD.    Colorist Richmond Lewis completely repainted the entire artwork because the original comics came out on cheap newsprint and could support just 60 different color palettes.    This trade paperback edition is on slick, glossy high quality paper and also boasts a great 40 page Mazzuchelli sketchbook and original Miller scripts.    Now that we've addressed the form, what about the content? Thematically, Year One bookends The Dark Knight Returns.  DKR represented a future Batman while Year One goes back to the beginning to explore Batman's origins.    Miller bucks convention by pitting Batman against corruption, greed and lethargy.  Rather than trotting out garish supervillains, Miller uses the grime and grit of Gotham City to humanize Batman.    I own both the original comics, which I bought and read as a child, and this great newly remastered version.      I love 'em and so will you.
0753820250|2.0|I did not give up on this, I read it all the way through and kept waiting for the book to get to a point, or grab my attention.  Nothing happened - after I finished the last page, my thought was \\"so what\\" - I questioned why I bothered to finish it.  It's a NO.
B00005JPFF|3.0|As a big Spider-Man fan, I was looking forward to this film a lot. First, let me point out it isn't a bad film. Far from it. But judge it by the standards of the excellent first 2 films and you may be disappointed.<br />There's a lot to pack into 140 minutes of movie here, perhaps too much. Strangely, not only did I find the film too long, but also too short because there were lots of story threads to tie together, but some things seemed drawn out (Peter's transformation from good to bad) and others rushed (the storyline involving Harry Osborn's \\"New Goblin\\" villain and Sandman) and while I wasnt restless at all I confess I was waiting for the appearence of Dark Spidey, when some mysterious, black, alien symbiote takes over Peter Parker and his Spider-Man costume and turns him into a boorish, arrogant person. It also makes him more powerful when he is Spider-Man.<br /><br />However, despite what I said earlier it is a fun, exciting action film with some great set pieces.  It's also very funny. The scenes of Peter Parker gone \\"bad\\" are largely played for laughs, the scene where he walks out of a suit shop in swanky new threads and begins dancing like John Travolta was so funny.<br />Having said that, it's out of step with the more menacing Bad Peter of the comic/cartoon though I realise the film series has always gone for a more comic style.<br />Venom was great, and I liked the Goblin fights too. I won't spoil anything for you, but not only does the film deal with heroes with a dark side, it also shows sympathetic, humanised villains like Harry Osborn as the New Goblin, who thinks Spider-Man killed his father (in the first film). This element of the story is done very well, I think.<br />Call me old fashioned if you like, but I thought the \\"soap opera\\" stuff with his girlfriend, Mary-Jane Watson (\\"MJ\\") humanises Parker/Spider-Man.  It doesnt try to hide the fact that its a fun superhero film, and does what it does well!
1857988094|3.0|\\"I Am Legend\\", the title work of this anthology, is a classic vampire novel and very well written. I enjoyed it and would give it 4 or maybe 5 stars.<br /><br />My problem with this collection though is that every other story in the book is terrible. I would give all of them 1 star. I literally had to make myself read some of them. I don't know if they were included as filler or if the author was just using the first story as a hook to get people to read his other stuff, or what the deal is, but they don't even read like they're by the same person<br /><br />The only thing I can think is either they are very early work or something he threw together just to run up the page count. I say all this to tell you if you can find \\"I Am Legend\\" by itself for cheaper than this version is listed for, get that instead. There is nothing other than that story worth spending your time on here<br /><br />To sum up: Definately read I Am Legend, just read it by itself.
0064409422|5.0|Four children, Lucy, Edmund, Suan and Peter are sent to live in the countryside home of an eccentric english professor during the Blitz of 1940. One rainy afternoon, Lucy hides in an old wardrobe an enters the magical land of Narnia.  This is the first of the Narnian chronicles written (although in the internal chronology of the series it is the second), and is slightly different in tone and internal consistency from the other books. The (much talked about) Christian allegory is most overt in this book- , but when I first read this as a young teen, I barely noticed. It's just a lot of fun: talking animals, evil witches, battles and adventures. It's not the best in the series, but it is a wonderful book, and a milestone in children's literature.

B00005JPFE|5.0|I loved Meet the Robinsons and think it was an under-rated film. I didn't think it could get more charming and fun than that but Ratatouille proved me wrong. It's about a rat who has a scent for what's good food and what's bad food. His father just wants him to use that gift to make sure the clang aren't eating poisoned food. When the clang has to relocate he loses them but he can live with that since he find's his favorite late chef's restuarant. The restuarant isn't the same without the chef but the rat's taste for what makes good food could be enough to turn it back into a 5 Star Restuarant. Only an untalented new chef knows that it's actually the rat who's the talented new chef.<br /><br />  The result is a charming appretising film that has the style of an old fashioned Disney movie. It has as good of a story as the traditional animated Disney films that they don't make anymore. Plus it has of a good of a lesson as the older films do as well. Although I also like the \\"keep moving forward\\" lesson that we get from Meet the Robinsons. This movie is about following your dreams without letting anything get in the way. Plus it's also great to look at. Paris looks so great here that it makes you feel like you're there or wish you were there. The food looks great too and I had to go cook something right when I got home after seeing the movie. I strongly recommend this film to anyone, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy Ratatouille.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|In the world of comic books there are many well known heroes that populate the various universes of each publishing company's books. From DC Comics' popular characters of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman to Marvel's Spiderman, X-Men, and Fantastic Four; each of those characters are beloved by comic book fans worldwide. Aside from those characters and their respective companies there are numerous other characters that have built a cult following in the comic world, but are not as well known by the mainstream public. One such character would be the Dark Horse comic book Hellboy, created by writer/artist Mike Mignola.<br /><br />In theaters many of Marvel and DC's heroes have been finding their way to the big screen with varying degrees of success, most are wildly successful, but a few have faltered along the way, but not too many of the other companies have managed to bring their properties to life with as much success. Sure, there was \\"Spawn\\" (property of Image Comics) and \\"Judge Dredd\\" (British publication called '2000 A.D.') in the mid-nineties, but they weren't all that successful, so the likelihood of these little known characters finding success with movie audiences was slim to none. At least that was the case until director Guillermo del Toro (\\"Blade 2\\") passed on an opportunity to direct the 3rd installment in the 'Harry Potter' franchise, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", to bring one of his favorite comic characters to life.<br /><br />With a successful director, such as Guillermo behind the lens, New Line Cinema must have felt fairly confident in the film's success after he had done wonders for them with the second installment in the 'Blade' trilogy, so with a director on board who respected the source material, and a talented cast of actors consisting of Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, and John Hurt, this little known comic book was about to become a living, breathing reality on the silver screen.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy\\" begins in 1944 during World War 2, when Rasputin, a mad sorcerer in league with Hitler, opens a dimensional portal to Hell, and through this dimension a baby demon emerges. Before Rasputin can take the baby demon and raise him to be an instrument of death and destruction, the Allied forces stop him. Among the Allies, is a young man who raises this demon, appropriately named Hellboy, teaching him the ways of the hero. As an adult, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) works with an agency known as the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, founded by the very man that raised him Professor Bloom (John Hurt), their job is to track any paranormal activity on Earth, and protect humanity from any danger that may be the result of that activity. Now, 60 years after releasing Hellboy on Earth, Rasputin has returned with the intention of using Hellboy to unleash the 7 gods of chaos upon Earth. With Earth's survival hanging in the balance, Hellboy and company, consisting of the firestarter Liz (Selma Blair), a human/amphibian hybrid named Abe Sapien (acted out by Doug Jones, but voiced by David Hyde Pierce), and FBI agent Myers, are in for the most difficult fight of their lives.<br /><br />After finding moderate success in Hollywood with the science-fiction/horror movie \\"Mimic\\", and following that up with his much more successful comic book hit \\"Blade 2\\", director Guillermo del Toro probably seemed without a doubt the best choice to bring Hellboy to the big screen. Not only is Guillermo a gifted director in the arena of special effects and horror, but he also has a knack for making his characters have a sense of humor which serves to lighten the mood in his otherwise darker toned movies, those elements combined together with his affection for the source material created the optimal conditions for another comic book movie franchise to be born, proving him the right man for the job.<br /><br />After Guillermo signed on, it was time to build the cast for the project. Now, I'm sure casting for this movie was probably typical by most comic book movie standards, but the difficult part had to have been finding the right man to don the red paint and prosthetics that are used to create Hellboy's demonic visage. Enter actor Ron Perlman (\\"Alien: Resurrection\\"), an actor that has made a career of playing somewhat strange, even scary characters, and who by the way is no stranger to wearing plenty of prosthetics. After all, Ron Perlman's best known role was that of the Beast in the live-action TV series \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" opposite actress Linda Hamilton (\\"The Terminator\\"), so with his experience with prosthetics and his penchant for strange characters, it was almost as if he was destined to be this character. The supporting cast members do very well with providing depth and reality to these strange new heroes that join together to face monsters determined to destroy us. There really wasn't a weak actor/actress in the entire bunch, a true rariety in the various genres that this movie fits into, i.e. horror, science-fiction, comic book. It was a welcome addition that everyone involved on screen and off appeared to have a deep respect for the source material and the fan base, and not just being there to collect a paycheck.<br /><br />The special effects for the movie were very well done, especially the scenes with Liz's fire power being showcased. These scenes are where the CGI really shines. As I touched on earlier, the prosthetics and costume department also deserves great praise for their oustanding work done here, from Hellboy to the monsters that he faces, to Abe Sapien or Kronen, every aspect of costumes, prosthetics, and practical effects is top-notch all the way. And finally, the story for \\"Hellboy\\" was very fast paced and entertaining, without skimming on the details of the character, which I appreciated greatly due to my lack of awareness in regards to this comic book. Without this entertaining and engaging story that was smartly written to play well with audiences that would be hard-core fans of the comic and those that have either little or no knowledge of the character whatsoever.<br /><br />With all of that being said, \\"Hellboy\\" is a terrific comic book based movie, that as far as I know, stays true to the source material without making newcomers to the character feel lost in the shuffle. Definitely a solid entry into the pantheon of comic book movies and a welcome addition at that.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.but the difficult part had to have been finding the right man to don the red paint and prosthetics that are used to create Hellboy's demonic visage.

0385522401|2.0|If you are easily seduced by beautiful sentences, you'll feel On Chesil Beach is a five-star book.  If you love exploring inner dialogue, you'll be even more pleased with this book.<br /><br />If, however, you like your stories to be compelling because of their relevance and interest to your own life, you'll wonder why in the world Mr. McEwan chose to write about this particular problem of poor communications in the context of 1962.  As you delve deeper into the book, you'll be even more puzzled by the book's pivotal event and the characters' reactions to it.<br /><br />The short book (neither novella nor full novel) is organized in five parts that seem much like the acts in a Greek tragedy.  The opening scene shows a couple dining in their room at an inn.  \\"They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible.\\"  The second act describes how they met.  The third act takes place in their bedroom in the inn.  The fourth act describes their courtship.  The fifth act takes place on the beach and in their lives afterward as they attempt and fail to communicate.<br /><br />Mr. McEwan does a good job of capturing your attention through exploring the couple's growing tension as they move toward the consummation of their marriage.  But past that point, the story seemed like a punctured balloon to me: My interest was gone.  I suspect that reaction is because I didn't feel close to either character; they are more there to entertain me than to lead me into experiencing the story like the characters do.<br /><br />Clearly, the story would have worked much better for me if focused around a more universal trial in marriage, such as handling both sets of parents during the birth of a first child.  I also thought that Mr. McEwen played the role of the Greek chorus too often . . . telling us what was going on rather than letting us see and hear the action.  The fourth part seems clearly out of place; it should have preceded the third part.<br /><br />Unless you are drawn to beautiful sentences and images, I suggest you skip this book . . . it's a misdirected storytelling foray by a talented writer that is eminently avoidable.ace; it should have preceded the third part.

0679735259|5.0|Any idiot who doesn't think Michael Herr captured the essence of northern I Corps during the Vietnam War in 1967-68 wasn't there, or certainly wasn't out in the boonies. I was. My Marine battalion (2/4) spent most of February '68 patrolling a stretch of dirt road through the mountains called \\"Highway 9\\" just a kilometer or two east of Khe Sahn. It was the winter monsoon and it rained constantly for days and nights at a stretch. Almost daily at about 5 p.m. we had to duck into our soggy bunkers with the scorpions, snakes and rodents when the B-52 \\"Arc Light\\" bombing raids flew in from Guam to pound the mountain jungles around Khe Sahn. Sometimes they got too close to our perimeters and rocks, pieces of trees and occasional NVA body parts fell onto our positions. Boring? Just when we got bored for a couple of hours, one of our patrols would make contact with some NVA and a furious firefight would break out. You ain't seen dark until you've been in jungle mountains on a cold rainy night with VC probing your perimeter. Read the dialogue! That's exactly how we talked there and then, how we thought, how we acted, etc. Yeah, just about everybody was stoned when they could be - it was a lot easier to get weed than beer or a drink, and you needed something to dull it. Herr was being honest by telling the story from a war correspondent's view (which he was), and ironic in calling reporters there \\"parasites\\" which is how the pinhead officers in Central Command saw them. But a lot of of soldiers and Marines were glad those \\"parasites\\" were there to tell the real story of what was happening in SE Asia. Herr's admiration for the grunts comes through loud and clear in Dispatches, as did his contempt for the politicians who launched the war - most of whom had never been in combat themselves but were too willing to send millions of young American draftees there to die in an ideological conflict with absolutely no strategic value - and the air-conditioned generals who ran it.  Herr captured the insanity of the Vietnam War - the craziness of most warfare. This is the only book I ever recommend to others who want to know what it was like in 'Nam.  Sound a little like the war in Iraq today? Those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them.

0757302661|2.0|I was so excited about the idea of Hypnobirthing for my first child.  My husband and I attended our local course, and read this book.  We practiced each week and followed each rule and guideline.  I had all my 'relaxation tracks' on my iPod and felt ready to have a beautiful birth.  Unfortunately, due to low fluid, I had to be induced unexpectedly.  Perhaps it was due to the introduction of Pitocin and induction techniques, but I endured 4 hours of my 13-hour labor trying to use only hypnobirthing before I broke and asked for an epidural (something I had been dead set against before I went in).  I tried using the system again during my 2 1/2 hours of pushing but unfortunately endured a lot of pain and exhaustion.  Hypnobirthing just did not work for me.  Maybe it would work better in a non-induced birth, but after my experience I won't be trying it again... I'm skipping straight to the epidural next time.  It's unfortunate since I had truly wanted a natural, non-invasive birth.  But with no feeling of control or pain management, I was forced into something I didn't want just to get through the ordeal.

B00001OH7P|4.0|Now I do like this. But it is not my favorite David Bowie album. Too many so-so songs (\\"Star\\"; \\"Hang Onto Yourself\\"; \\"Five Years\\"); too much campy over-orchestration (\\"Rock and Roll Suicide\\"), one total bomb (\\"It Ain't Easy\\") - he even recycles the \\"Sweet Jane\\" riff on \\"Starman\\", which is otherwise very good. Still, it's Ziggy Stardust, man! You know? It's not like there aren't all kinds of excellent songs on this album, because there are a truckload! You know \\"Moonage Daydream\\", right? What a guitar solo! And you know \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", I assume! The lyrics! The riff! And, again, the guitar solo! \\"Starman\\" is pretty good too, though I think Bowie could've written his own riff rather than take one of Lou Reed's. Been spending too much time around Jimmy Page, have you? Continuing on, \\"Suffragette City\\" may not be terribly insightful, but it's a Stonesy rocker with a powerful horn section, so I like it. Another two songs I like that you don't often hear too much of are the cathartic \\"Soul Love\\" and the groupie-themed rocker \\"Lady Stardust\\". Oh yeah, and then there's the concept. The bisexual androgynous alien coming down from space to save everybody's life. It's a bit clunky, but like Tommy I find Ziggy Stardust is more about the music than the concept. And the music's good!

1400032717|4.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" by Mark Haddon is a fascinating and thoroughly engrossing novel for all readers, but particularly those who want to get a better understanding of Autism Spectrum Disorder. In this book, the reader gets the unique opportunity to view the world from inside the mind of a 15-year old boy with Asperger Syndrome (i.e., a high-functioning autistic).<br /><br />The plot is brilliant and unpredictable. I read the book in one day and could barely keep myself away from it. It is set in the present in a small English town, about 100 miles from London. The book is told entirely from the voice of the boy, Christopher Boone. In the beginning, the boy discovers his neighbor's dog, Wellington, dead in the yard with a garden fork piercing its body. This starts him on a detective hunt to uncover who killed the dog. The journey takes many unexpected twists and turns. In the end, the boy has gained a far better understanding of the world and his ability to deal with it. Highly recommended

Tom Selleck is great as the lead actor---a complicated figure who has a set of core values that are constantly tested by his own set of personal problems. Rather than sensationalism, special effects, or mindless humor, the Jesse Stone films actually rely upon character development and an interesting plot.

Oh thats right, only bluray has the rights to these movies. Spare me your extras that I won't even watch because i'll be watching a whole lot more movies with bluray!
0312330537|3.0|This is probably the worst book I've finished in a very long time. The adventure is decent; the minute details of the author's feelings and perceptions are not.  Florid, ridiculous paragraphs heap a thousand words on every glance, every new acquaintance--and look out when he actually touches someone! Rather than devote so much time to purple prose, he would have done better to supply factual research about the culture and history of India and its people.  That would have been more engaging, more interesting and more worthwhile.  As it is, we get just a glimpse of India without any context that goes beyond what he can see with his own eyes.    Those looking for a more concise, more insightful and certainly more rewarding bit of literature regarding life in India should ready \\"A Fine Balance.\\"

I would highly recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear a great collection of beautiful songs sung by a great vocalist!

When I had watched this film it literally blew me away: the acting, photography, location, and the music.  The music was so haunting and beautiful, I embarked out ot purchase the soundtrack.  Holly Hunter was spectacular and Anna Paquin well deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1993.  I recommed this film to anyone, if you are the individual who believes nothing of cinema: Watch it once.  You must at least see the film in order to view the contemporary aspects of the cultural differences of the Piano.
B000BT97AO|2.0|A young girl has grown up with her father's dream of a circus.  But this is not her dream.  She wants out.  Then her mother falls ill and the girl finds herself in a strange city full of bizarre people and creatures.  Here everyone wears masks (or so they say but it is not quite true).  She teams up with a juggler named Valentine and they attempt to survive in the strange city as it is slowly attacked by the Shadows.  The Land of Shadow is taking over the Land of Light.  The Light Queen is asleep and needs something to wake her up.    Our unlikely pair set out to find the missing item and save the city.  Along the way they encounter much strangeness and many strange beings.  The girl is mistaken for the princess of Shadow and the truth becomes know.  The princess and the girl have switched places and the princess is trying to destroy the city so she will never have to return.  Can the girl and Valentine avoid the shadows, escape the evil Queen, wake the good Queen, and set things right?  There is only one way to find out and that is by watching the movie.    This film is slow to start and opens like a bad soap opera.  It is a long time before any element of the fantastic surfaces.  The world is strange and the visual techniques are innovative.  As we learn the history of the land we find it really makes little sense.  The creation myth has a few holes and inconsistencies (I have not yet read the book so I don't know if these are new to the film or carried over).  There are some wonderful visual techniques used but there is an extreme lack of story to hang them on.  You may want to pass this one up.
0385340559|4.0|\\"So, what's the plan, boss?\\" Dixon asked, and the question sent Reacher spinning nine years into the past, to the last time he had heard anyone ask it.<br />\\"Same as ever,\\" he said. \\"We investigate, we prepare, we execute. We find them, we take them down, and then we p**s on their ancestors' graves.\\"(Page 110)<br /><br />This has always summed up Reacher's attitude towards his enemies--foreign and domestic. That attitude isn't about to change in the eleventh novel of the series which does find him occasionally questioning some of the financial choices he has made since he left the service. Reacher is still a drifter with very little to his name and for the most part is content with his free floating lifestyle. Frances Neagley from his old CID team knows how he thinks and gets a message to him through his bank balance on his latest ATM receipt.  Reacher makes his way to Los Angeles and knowing how she thinks, and knowing that she knows how he thinks, etc. quickly is able to find her and meet.<br /><br />At least one of their old team has been brutally killed by being dumped from a helicopter at three thousand feet without a parachute and other members are not answering her messages. Frances and Reacher could be the only survivors as it appears that the entire team is being hunted and systematically eliminated.  They don't know why or what they are up against and the clock is ticking against them. Their first stumbling forays into the investigation lead them into a maze of death and deceit, military weapons contracts, and plenty of action that always characterize a Jack Reacher novel.<br /><br />With this being the eleventh novel in the series there is little new insight into the Jack Reacher character. Long time readers know most of the back story briefly covered in the novel and as such there are no real surprises just a couple of confirmations of previously implied events. Instead the focus is on the action as Reacher leads a mission that honors the old CID motto.<br /><br />\\"You do not mess with the special investigators.\\"<br /><br />The result is a revenge and retaliation read that rockets along and focuses on action. Action becomes a secondary character always a page or two away and Reacher, never known for having patience or subtly, reacts hard at every turn. This isn't a deep thinking book as the brief moments that Reacher contemplates his financial situation are always short and resolved by him punching someone, driving cars through fences, or some other violent act that ultimately gets the job done. The job always gets done with Reacher on the case and one wouldn't want it any other way.<br /><br />Kevin R.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|A Shepard in Morocco barters for a rifle and gives it to his two boys to guard the sheep. When the boys decide too try it out, they strike a passing tourist bus. Unfortunately, the bullet strikes a vacationing American woman in the middle of nowhere. The bus driver convinces them that it would be best to go to his small village which is nearby with the claim the village has a doctor. Unable to be transported any further, the woman and her husband are dropped off in this very remote village, to await help. Blanchett gives a stunning performance as the critically wounded wife, and Pitt is her anguished husband, as they rediscover their love under duress.    This shooting triggers off events in other people's lives across the world. We go to a troubled, deaf Japanese girl who causes a commotion, and the American couple's nanny does not wish to miss her son's wedding, and attempts to bring the children into Mexico with her without any thoughts of the possible ramifications. To explain any more details of 'Babel' would spoil your viewing experience.    This movie shows some of the consequences of the Tower of Babel in today's world. That even though today you can talk to someone across the world, it does not mean you can communicate with them. That language is still a barrier and our frame of reference is formed by our cultures where we are raised. I recommend that you rent or check this movie out from your local library. Note there are some sexually explicit scenes that were pretty much unnecessary for this melodrama.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|Bought this for my 10-year old space enthusiast who sat down and watched all the way through it with the occassional forced break for sleep.  A nice mix of historical footage and dramatical re-enactments that tells the story of the race to the moon in an interesting way that allows for the strengths, and some weaknesses, of the people who worked on the space program to be highlighted.  Very enjoyable!

With genuinely good performances, a warm and witty script, and music that comes at you like a flowing stream, 'Once' is winning on every level.<br /><br />'Once,' as in \\"Once upon a time,\\" he (Glen Hansard)(generically named a guy) meets a gal (Marketa Irglova) (similarly named) on the street.  He is a musician, belting out his own songs at an outdoor mall using a guitar with a gaping hole to accompany him.  At the beginning we find him chasing down a robber who's stolen his guitar case with all his change.  Such is his meager existence.  He hasn't quit his day job, either.  He works at a small, dirty vacuum repair shop when he's not making music.  She stops by him one day and is impressed.  (She throws in a dime, something he has the contumely to acknowledge a few times, yet he doesn't have the money to buy her magazine, either.)  She asks him pointed questions that put him on the spot, but her look and smile are so lovely that he's able to overcome the awkwardness, especially since she at first suits him as being someone she can leave her vacuum with where he performs.  (It's just quirky designs like this that make the movie so effective.)  He gets too forward at one point later, but he softens her interest to find that she, too, lives in a dingy apartment with her daughter, Ivana, who is just a toddler and her mother.  She is from the Czech Republic.  He falls in love, but both find the right notes musically.  She plays the piano and the keyboards, and her voice makes them a perfect match.  Remarkably, the powerfully felt music translates so well, and the purposely amateurish video clips of her show the streamlined fantasy she has become.  So focused is the series of home movies that (thankfully) stick out from MTV videos and makes the latter seem overwrought.  The music, the videos, and the movie sort of melt together into one story and song.  His passion inspires the music, but in every way she brings out the best in him.  Her passion also is in the music, but her inspiration is in many ways the same and different from his.<br /><br />'Once' is truly a departure from other film fare.  At this point, I'll venture to wager it is one the best films of 2007.  After this experience, a good movie like 'Music and Lyrics' seems like a hollow confection in comparison.

0345441184|5.0|I read about 200-300 books and this book is just the best book I have ever read in my life. They made a movie out of it, but it does not come even close to the book itself. It is the best book about Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table tale in existence. I can remember the time when I read the book the first time, years ago  and how I missed my city train stop.<br /><br />I remember very well, when I was asked to leave the train, when it arrived at its final destination and I was still in the depth of ancient Britain. The fantasy world created in the book felt just so real, it made me almost believe, that it was so and not a fairy tale. I was in the middle of it, inside the characters.<br /><br />I was first scared of this big book with more than 1000 pages with small letters, but it had to be this way, because it is epic.

The Picture Quality is top notch, and the Uncompressed Audio track makes this Movie felt and heard!    After 10 yrs the picture was awesome, my wife even commented on the clarity, which always helps justify a purchase!    If you haven't seen this in awhile, get the Blu-Ray! It is well worth it!
B00005JPKE|3.0|And you would have had a decent picture of the Japanese side of Iwo Jima.  But, a thoroughly unneccesary section of the film where first a captured Marine is treated humanely by Baron Nishi, and then shortly thereafter, surrendered Japanese prisoners are executed by another Marine, sits in politically correct smugness smack in the middle of an otherwise decent film.  It may make the \\"anti-war\\" message, but it rang false, and at that point the film faltered.  True, earlier a Marine captive was shown beaten and bayoneted, but this was juxtaposed with another Japanese being burned to death, as if the Marine captive was being punished for that death.  The reality of these battles was something else.     The historian William Manchester was a young Marine in the Pacific and in his book Goodbye Darkness, about his experiences, said that there was a tacit understanding between the Marines and Japanese in the island campaigns: neither side took many prisoners.  At least while the battle was raging.  That was just the way it was. Each campaign was a fight to the death.  He also pointed out that the Marines always had help from native islanders against the Japanese, not because the islanders loved Marines or even knew what an American was, but because they hated the Japanese because of their brutality toward these conquered peoples.    Too bad, because otherwise this was a fine film pretty fairly showing the view from the other side of the cultural divide.  It demonstrates the crazy waste and harshness of the Bushido code, most especially as it is sternly and unthinkingly applied to the average drafted Japanese soldier.  It illustrates how these unyielding notions caused the needless sacrifice of their own troops in forced personal suicide and suicidal frontal assaults on fixed positions.  It also showed the human dimension of these men left to do nothing else but die on that sulfurous rock.   I had no problems with those elements of the film that depicted the common humanityof men with families and love of their country.    I liked the view of the unconventional General Kuribayashi's strategy, often undone by the willfully obtuse views of his own officers, and the equally effective view of life as lived by the common soldier, often starved and beaten by these same latter day samurai.  The action scenes, as in Flags of Our Fathers, were well done and the production design I so admired in that film is, of course, still present here.    I liked the actors and the interplay between them.  I admire the production values and this is often a quiet and interesting film.  I certainly have no problem with seeing the flip side of the battle depicted in Flags of Our Fathers.  I think the film was doing quite well in depicting the humanity of soldiers who, by and large, would rather be home or anywhere else.  It didn't need any extra \\"message\\" slipped in, and while it might not bother others, I found it an unneccessary excess plea, and a bit disingenuous.  At any rate, the film is worth seeing.
B0007WZWXQ|4.0|I've loved Judas Priest for a long time now, so I was hot to pick this up on release day. While it is far from flawless, it's the kind of classic heavy metal that proves what so many of the current crop of heavy metal bands completely miss - just because you can play loud and fast, it doesn't make you heavy. \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" (what a classic album title!) delivers that message with accelerant.<br /><br />From the ascending guitars and Rob Halford's inimitable scream that tears the album open for \\"Judas Is Rising,\\" it's clear that the band is in stride. Tipton and Downing blaze through classic riffs in such standard fare like \\"Demonizer\\" and \\"Hellrider,\\" and there is plenty of the kind of badman posturing that got the old PMRC in cold sweats back in the day. Especially good is \\"Revolution,\\" the kind of in-your-face rock that made \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" an anthem.<br /><br />\\"Angel Of Retribution's\\" other big surprise is \\"Angel,\\" a tragic love ballad that could easily be attributed to Rob Halford's personal orientation (this guy's more a gay icon that anyone wants to give him credit for!), and it strikes a personal note on an album that is otherwise filled with aggression (\\"Revolution\\"), testosterone (\\"Judas Rising\\") and mythology (the overlong and album low point, \\"Loch Ness\\"). But all in all, Judas Priest is delivering the goods.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Second efforts always get the critics wishing for this wishing for that blah blah blah...I liked it at first because I wanted to hear more, then I liked it more, after I got to \\"know the songs.\\" I first heard her on KMTT out of Seattle and knew I had to buy her first offering. This one is good, sure its differnt but it's still good. It's the next offering that I'm concerned about...will the music industry taint her or will she be more like Emmylou Harris or DMB and skirt the music industries strong armed tactics.  Honestly I buy 3 or 5 CDs a week and this one is still on the top of my rotaion and always in my Ipods \\"active\\" playlist.
B00005JKHP|4.0|I do not know why it took so long to release the first Star Trek movie on DVD. All other Star Trek Movies are already around on DVD for quite a while. I can only guess. Okay, there is not much action, but the story is compelling. I do not know why most of the people always think about galactic battles, when they think about a Sci-Fi Movie. The best Sci-Fi Stories are about People, Society and Mankind (like Arthur C. Clarkes's \\"2001:A Space Odyssey\\", \\"2010:The year we make contact\\", Wolfgang Petersons \\"Enemy Mine\\" and Carl Sagan's \\"Contact\\").<br /><br />I would have given the movie 5 stars, but the acting was a bit poor in some of the scenes. I think this movie is not just for Star Trek fans, \\"Trekkies or Trekkers\\". I think this movie is something for everyone, who is not a pure action freak and wants to think about a movie and its messages.<br /><br />(Original review January 1, 2002)
0312360266|5.0|When I bought this book, I was like this looks like an okay read.  I sat down and literally I could not put it down.  I have not been this intoxiced with reading a book, sense I started reading Tamora Pierce and J.K. Rowling.  If you like to read about fantasy, and paranormal activies, than you must read this book. I cannot wait until the next one comes out!
B000026I8U|5.0|Why isn't Manu Chao more well-known in the States? He So should be! I discovered his music purely by accident and have since learned he is very well-known throughout the world, but rarely comes to the US for touring. He was at San Francisco Civic Center in summer of 2007, and the place was packed. I can only describe this music through the title of this review. It is playful, simple, creative, thought-provoking and unique. Chao mixes several different languages into the lyrics of one tune and reuses musical compositions from other songs for new. Some 'pureblood' musicians criticize that last part, but for me it makes me feel like his music is an old friend, one who immediately makes you smile every time you see him! Get this CD so you can hear 'King of the Bongo!' It's worth the purchase price just for that alone!<br /><br />Review by author of Harlot's Sauce: A Memoir of Food, Family, Love, Loss, and Greece
0060557818|5.0|This being my first Gaiman novel, I didn't quite know what to expect. I saw MirrorMask and was very impressed so I thought that I would enjoy the read, but I had no idea how much.<br /><br /> Richard Mayhewis a sympathetic if somewhat whiney character who does not seem to be particiapting in his own life very much. in fact he gives new meaning to the phrase mild mannered, drifting through a painfully avarage exsistance almost literally apologising for being alive. With a girlfriend who's in love with his \\"potential\\", only one real friend, and a job where he's barely noticed. Richard is hardly living on the edge. Then in one night with one random act of kindness his safe, sane, predictable life quite literally disappers. Richard finds himself traversing the eerie darkness, and nightmarish unreality of London Below. traveling with a motley crew that may very well get Richard killed. He unwillingly joins a quest to help a young girl with mysterious ablities solve the murder of her family. All while being persued by seemingly immortal assassins. Contracted by an anonymous employer.<br /><br />Admittedly the first few chapters were slow, but it's completely worth hanging in there. Neverwhere is elegant, inventive, and as rich as a vintage photograph. I'll definetly be reading more from Mr. Gaiman
1594489505|3.0|First, Kite Runner is probably one of my favorite books ever.<br /><br />His second book is not even close to the top of my list.  Not that it isn't a great story or a well written book, but I found it almost too sad and depressing to read.  I wanted to stop reading many times because of the atrocities that the people are faced and the abusiveness of the Rasheed.  It really bothered me that there are actually people like him and the Radicals in this world.  I sometimes thought about how I wish I could jump into the book and knock some serious sense into Rasheed.  These women faced hardship after hardship, as if their luck would never end.  The only thing that kept me going was that I knew there was a happy ending somewhere.  An ending that would bring happiness to these women.  An ending that would make me feel better about reading this book.
0736063684|5.0|I learned alot from this book.  The pictures are awesome and the notations clarify things that I haven't found in any other workout book or magazine.  I added 12 new exercises to my workout!  Another great book to get is Arnold Schwarzenegger's Bible on Bodybuilding (the actual title may be a little different).
B000PY52EU|5.0|This had to be a marketing nightmare for the execs at Paramount.  The image most people had that I spoke to at the time of it's release was that this was a film about a black man who chains a white girl to his radiator.  Lurid bondage images ensue.  I can imagine this tag would repel black audiences as well as white.  Though I've been a fan of both Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci for years my wife refused to see the movie with me when it was in theatres.  Paramount doesn't help it's cause by reinforcing this image in it's cover art.  This will probably turn out to be one of the best films of the year.  Let's put things in context.  Lazarus (Jackson) is experiencing a personal crisis because his wife recently left him for his brother.  Rae (Ricci) is a young woman with deep psychological wounds whose G.I. boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is shipping off.  Lazarus salves his sadness with booze.  Rae also engages in self destructive behavior not the least wanton promiscuity.  After a night of loose behavior with a bunch of rowdies Rae is picked up by Ronnie's best friend and subsequently beaten and left for dead on Lazarus' farm.  Upon finding a semi-conscious Rae, Lazarus attempts to nurse her back to health.  Lazarus, a god fearing man, subsequently finds out about Rae's reputation and in a drunken fever chains Rae to his radiator.  It is Lazarus' feeble attempt to reform Rae.  Not to give anything away Lazarus' eventually has an epiphany and realizes you cannot enforce morality but you can set an example.  It is then that the true bond between Lazarus and Rae grows.  There is a real love between the two and they have a redemptive influence on each other.  In other words they heal each other's wounds.  The film also emphasizes the healing influence of the polar opposites, religion and music, mainly the blues.  You won't find a more beautiful scene than the one where Rae sings \\"Let it Shine\\" at the knee of Lazarus as he strums his guitar.  \\"Black Snake Moan\\"is one of the more daring and provocative films in years.  Though it's rough going at times there is a morality at it's center.  Credit director Craig Brewer for tackling challenging material and making it work.  Jackson, who I always admired for taking ambitious roles, may have given the performance of his career.  This isn't hyperbole.  You have to see it to believe it.  Ricci is just as good here.  Timberlake also gives a sympathetic turn here as the anxiety-ridden Ronnie.  \\"Black Snake Moan\\" is a film that should not be forgotten.
6305907145|1.0|Next to Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park is my favorite book of Jane Austen. The movie however was an utter disappointed.  Fanny and many if not most of the other characters are completely misrepresented. Not to mention that her beloved brother William who is a large part of the novel is not even alluded to once in the movie. Slavery is a running theme, which is quite an inappropriate and disturbing deviation from the novel. Badly Done!!!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Ok for starters, this cd to me is much better than thankful and pretty up there with breakaway. All the crap that came along with breakaway is the reason why this album might be depressing. People might think its all about boyfriends, but its not. For example, Haunted isn't about a guy its about someone she went to high school with (girl). Also, its not much more depressing than breakway was. I mean Hole is pretty sad but at the other end of the spectrum you have Yeah, Be Still, Sober, How I Feel, Chivas (if you dont know what Chivas is, go to track 13 and fast foward to 5:16). Musically, the cd is very versatile and it may not sound radio friendly at first but remember music changes all the time because 20 years ago you wouldnt hear the crap you hear now. In other words, I'd rather hear Sober on the radio instead of the other junk. So I think this cd has stuff for everyone and thats what a cd should be about, not about selling out.
B000002KDX|4.0|In 1972, three Air Force brats, Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnell, and Gerry Beckley, released an album of acoustic guitar based songs with vocal harmonies, and titled it America, also their band's name. Two songs from the album, A Horse With No Name and I Need You, became hit singles, attained worldwide attention, and the rest, as they say, is history. This debut album includes not only those two big hits, but also the classics Sandman, Here, and Riverside, which are all very good, and all fan favorites. The songs feature CSNY-like harmonies, California hippie lyrics, and some excellant acoustic guitar work. The music is thoughtful, emotionally engaging, and the songs all highlight very capable musicianship. Three Roses is a delightful love song, and Children includes beautiful vocal harmonies that petition the young, \\"Oh, come on children, get your heads back together again\\" (if only we would have listened). In all, America is a very good folk-rock album, probably the group's best, and California hippie folk-rock at it's best. And you've gotta love that crisp acoustic guitar sound!
0670034711|5.0|I loved reading this book about the author's search for love and enlightenment.  I highly recomnend to any woman who's ever been through uncertain relationships and searched for themselves.  Elizabeth Gilbert writes in a very easy manner which is honest and very humorous.
B00005J6UP|4.0|you gotta be a goon times 25 if you didnt immediately fall in love with Goonies, at any age. But how wonderful it was for those of us in the pre teen years, who saw this when it first came out. How magical the ride was.<br /><br />I mean Speilberg, Donner and Chris Columbus. I mean the cream of the incessant crop.<br /><br />\\"Goonies\\" is quintessential Speilberg. When a film, not in the era of CGI, and computer animated everything, can just grip you with an amazing score, a slew of talented kids, and a storyline that is gripping, flowing and totally fun, you feel so great about yourself over and over again. I can be down in the dumps to the extreme, and throw Goonies in, and it takes my through a rough day with smiles and enticing childlike splendor.<br /><br />How many of us wanted to be part of that group? How many of us dreamt, in those wee hours, before slept crept in, when we saw Goonies for the first time, or the 90th time, and dreamt such amazing things: to find hidden treasure, to climb down wells and discover hidden caves, to dig through canals and taverns in our backyards and find our own One Eyed Willie, eye mattey, ehhhhhh, yes, the magic of the Gonnies so transformed my youth and brought me to that magical place of make believe, which only the brilliance of Speilberg can do producing. Pirates of the Carribean doesn't touch Goonies for sentimentality or the like.<br /><br />I will never forget seeing this when I was 9 or 10 or so, and getting all red with my mother when they kiss in the dark. I was learning about life then, and Goonies certainly helped me realize the wonderous things I was to look forward to.<br /><br />Not to mention that the character actress Anne Ramsey is impeccably sinister and perfect in her role as Mom Fratelli.<br /><br />One of my favorite films in the world as a child, and totally up there even by today's standards.<br /><br />Chunk, Baby Ruth, Rocky Road, and the hilarious performance by Corey Feldman.<br /><br />Thank you.
B000P2A24W|5.0|The boys from my home state didn't disapoint once again.  I can't wait to get the whole album into my ipod.  This album ROCKS.
0062502182|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time.  It's simple yet layered with many delightful truths of life.  If you're into Metaphysical readings and are looking for something fun and easy to read, definitely pick this up.  It's an allegory that children can read so don't expect an indepth philosophical exposition on life.  Have fun and good reading!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|We first watched this entire series on netflix and fell in love with it.  If you have any interest in the space program at all it will hold your interest and you will learn even more.      When Amazon ran this as a gold box special we bought 3 sets - one for us and one for each of our parents.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I didn't think this movie was awesome, but it was okay. Don't do anything else (like sewing) when you are watching it, your eyes have to be on the screen at all times or you will be completely lost.
1400063515|4.0|I struggled whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars.  I finally decided on 4 because the author makes some interesting points and the book is worth reading.  However, the author comes across as very impressed with himself and parts are thorny reading.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|Okay, maybe my review title deserves one star as well, but I couldn't resist. I also am a girl who definitely appreciates good romantic comedy. I actually loved Love Actually. But this movie was simply one of the worst movies I've ever wasted two hours on.     Where to begin? The dialogue is completely unbelievable and cheesy. I cringed, I was so embarrassed for the actors having to utter the lines. The plot is implausible, with embarrassing devices like the stupid winds out in LA making crazy things happen. The acting...I have always liked Kate Winslet and Jack Black. And on occasion I've enjoyed watching Cameron Diaz and Jude Law. But each and every one of them seemed to be phoning it in. Well, I don't know about Cameron -- she succeeded in making her character a completely unlikeable person, and I found myself hoping for her romance to fail. Also Jude Law looks suspiciously orange all through the movie. He looked like he tasted of cheese. Not a good look, especially compared to how dreamy he looked in a movie like Enemy at the Gates. Not only that, his character comes off as so smarmy that you'd wonder why Diaz would be genuinely attached to him in the first place. The same goes for Rufus Sewell's character, who appears in the beginning as the man who strings Kate Winslet on. He is obviously so toxic and buffoonish; while Winslet is so obviously too smart and lovely for him. It's just not believable that she was ever under his spell.     Overall, I thought the movie was simultaneously trying to pander to its audience while actually succeeding in insulting it. At least, I felt insulted. While Love Actually isn't a perfect movie, at least it was far better written and acted and therefore infinitely more palatable as an escapist chick flick. Skip this one and rent that instead. Or Bridget Jones. Or Four Weddings and a Funeral. Or Two Weeks Notice. Or anything else with Hugh Grant, really.
B000BQ7BX2|4.0|Having listened intently to this set two times now, once with scores in hand, once without, I have to give this set less than a 5 star rating. The sound is adequate, compressed at times, muddy at others. The later symphonies fare better than 1 & 2. Conducting is fine: very straightfoward and unfussy. Plays it straight. And maybe that's a problem. The sixth in particular never really scales the heights or depths. Same story with 8. Layout is weird, but economical. My biggest beef is the orchestral execution. There are a LOT of bloopers that should have been fixed. In a live concert you can accept, even expect, some error in music this difficult. But on recordings they become very irritating. I grant that most people would never notice any, but if you have a good ear and really know this music there are some problems. The worst is an abundance of wrong notes in the 4th movement of the 7th, which otherwise is a superb version -- one of the best. Another easy to spot example occurs at the end of the 6th: why did the cellos leave the bass clarinet to fend for itself just a few bars before the end? Why didn't someone fix this?  I'm glad I heard this set, but there are better, albeit more expensive. As a complete set there isn't any that is altogether perfect, but Solti/Decca, Haitink/Philips, Kubelik/DG and deWaart/RCA come closer.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I'm not sure that I could add much to the previous 303 reviews, but take heed: Corinne Bailey Rae is the real deal! I first heard her while viewing the Peter O'Toole movie, \\"Venus\\". After seeing her name on the ending credits, I told myself that I have got to hear more of Ms. Rae. This CD does not disappoint. Languid, relaxed, rhythmic, and calming are all appropriate adjectives to describe her vocal style. If you ever return from work after a stressful day, play this CD! If it doesn't help relax you, nothing besides medication will help. I was impressed to see that Corinne wrote or co-wrote every song on this CD.<br /><br />Selections: \\"Like a Star\\"-smooth sound, a good opener<br />\\"Enchantment\\"- good, but a bit too mellow<br />\\"Put Your Records\\"- as catchy a tune as there is; a true hit. I want to listen to it over and over<br />\\"Trouble Sleeping\\"- a wonderful, expressive love song<br />\\"Breathless\\"- this song leaves me breathless<br />\\"Butterfly\\"-more beauty from Corrine<br /><br />Ms. Bailey seems to have been influenced by Billie Holliday, Sade, and there even seems to a bit of Rickie Lee Jones in her voice. The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is due to slight drop-off in the quality of a few of the songs. Ms. Bailey appears to a refreshing example of the new  genre of British female singer/songwriters like Lily Allen. I look forward to her next recording.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I will admit that I have been really nervous the past couple of years.  With the success of the Raconteurs and Jack and Meg moving to completely different parts of the country I was afraid that the beginning of the end of the White Stripes had commenced.  And who knows, perhaps it has.  But Jack's new band commitments and their new places of residence certainly hasn't impacted the quality of their work together.  My fear was that Jack might keep some of his \\"A\\" material for his new band and that the overall quality of ICKY THUMP might suffer as a result.  But it is clear from this album that Jack either has an awful lot of \\"A\\" material or that he is giving the Raconteurs his \\"B\\" material.  ICKY THUMP is simply a brilliant album, definitely as good or better than GET BEHIND ME SATAN and at spots as good as anything before that (though ELEPHANT remains my favorite White Stripes album).<br /><br />Although I like this album more than GET BEHIND ME SATAN, they are definitely kindred affairs.  Both have the same kind of eclecticism and almost any song on the one album could have been fit onto the other.  I personally find Jack White to be one of the wonders of music.  While I confess to nursing a sizable crush on Meg White, hers is a supporting role to Jack.  I find him to be one of the most innovative guitarists in rock, with a seemingly endless supply of new and interesting musical ideas.  His guitar toolkit is a bit larger than those of most other guitarists.  The same can be said for his song writing as well.<br /><br />If there is a criticism that can be made of the album, it is that the first half is stronger than the second half.  Though perhaps that should be amended to say that the first two-thirds is better than the final third.  This distinction allows me to include the absolutely delightful \\"Rag and Bone\\" and the hard-driving \\"Little Cream Soda\\" with the best part of the album.  But none of the final songs are actually bad or even below average.  \\"A Martyr for My Love for You\\" is a good enough song, with some fairly pedestrian hooks, but the point is that it isn't quite up there with the earlier songs.  The album starts off with a vengeance, with the superb title track followed by \\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You're Told), which is in turn followed by the marvelously long winded \\"300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues.\\"  Then follows the lone song on the album not written by White, the country classic \\"Conquest,\\" which under his reinterpretation is certainly no longer country.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the most enjoyable albums of the year.  I know that some White Stripes fans tend to specialize in either early or late albums; they prefer either the rock purity of DE STIJL or the eclecticism of GET BEHIND ME SATAN or the sheer power of ELEPHANT.  Well, forgive me if I like it all.  I don't get people who want performers to never evolve or change.  I've been delighted with the White Stripes because they have never stayed stuck in one place.  They've continued to grow and evolve.  I can't wait until their next album.  Let's just hope that their changing personal lives and professional obligations don't prevent a \\"next.\\"  But as great as Jack White is, he is never as good when he and his \\"sister\\" Meg crank it.<br /><br />Finally, Jack and Meg have always been interesting to look at on stage.  They've always worn interesting outfits, but their psychedelic suits on the front cover of the CD is the most bracing that I've seen worn since the days of the Flying Burrito Brothers GILDED PALACE OF SIN.You\\" is a good enough song, with some fairly pedestrian hooks, but the point is that it isn't quite up there with the earlier songs.

0800127862|4.0|First off, this edition of the film is a double sided dvd which contains the widescreen and full screen versions of the film.  This edition is hard to find because it looks EXACTLY like the release which only contains the full screen version.  Rather than pay $35 for the widescreen version of the film from a seller on amazon, you should go to hastings and sift through there copies looking on the back at the small box below arnold. It should say \\"widescreen or standard formats\\".  I got my copy for $6.99.  Nothing against amazon, but the few individual sellers trying to charge a fortune for this film are just trying to make a cheap buck.  Amazon itself is the best place on the web or off to buy dvds.<br /><br />As far as the film itself, the first half is absolutely awesome arnold-tastic action, but the second half get kinda dull.  The first makes it worth adding to any action collection.  Ice cream cone to the skull.
B0001N9ZKW|5.0|When Richard Thompson released this album, his first with his wife Linda, he had already a relatively long recording career behind him. As a founder member of Fairport Convention he was the group on their first five albums. His characteristic guitarplaying style can also be heard on Sandy Denny's early solo albums and he had released his own soloalbum \\"Henry the Human Fly\\" in 1972.<br /><br />During his time with Fairport Convention Thompson matured a lot as a songwriter and many of the band's early favourites were either written or co-written by Thompson. His inspiration by traditional British music also became still more clear. Many of the songs on \\"Henry\\" and \\"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight\\" actually sound like they were traditional folk-songs.<br /><br />His collaboration with Linda lasted for 8 years and resulted in 6 great albums. This their first is often regarded as the strongest with Richard's songwriting extraordinary inspired and varied, and his distictive voice blends beautifully with Linda's on these great songs.<br /><br />The terrific opener \\"When I Get to the Border\\", sung by Richard,  is catchy with optimistic lyrics. A little unsual for Thompson, whose lyrics often are dark and sad.<br /><br />Equally catchy ( and optimistic ) is the title track which deserved to be hit beautifully sung by Linda.<br /><br />Heartbreakingly beautiful is also the sad ballad \\"Withered and Died\\", sung by Linda in way that makes you think of her friend Sandy Denny.<br /><br />The dark side of Richard's songwriting become apprent on songs like \\"Down Where the Drunkards Roll\\", \\"Has He Got a Friend For Me\\" and especially \\"The End of the Rainbow\\" . Even the catchy \\"We'll Sing Hallelujah\\" has some pretty dismal lyrics.<br /><br />The budget for this album was supposedly very limited, but it does show anywhere. Great arrangements, crisp sound and best of all strong songwriting and palying from first track till the closer \\"The Great Valerio\\".<br /><br />The bonus-tracks are 3 1975 live-recordings - nice to have but some may find that they disturb the very consistent feel of the original album, which I won't hesitate to call a masterpiece.that they disturb the very consistent feel of the original album, which I won't hesitate to call a masterpiece.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I had not watched this movie since it was released to DVD some years ago,so I decided to watch it again in my home theater. I must say I did not remember this film being this good! It is truely an amazing film that has the viewer running through a gambit of emotions. This movie runs close to 2 1/2 hours, but it moves along quicky. The DVD transfer and extras for the 2 disc set are excellent and worth owning.
B00062ZE44|5.0|I know it's not going to happen, but I think that a one to ten star rating system would make it far easier to rate an album more accurately. The reason I bring this up on this particular review is because I know that from time to time I too am guilty of giving a five star rating to an album that perhaps doesn't quite deserve it. However, this is not one of those times; this IS a five star album.<br /><br />This album is first-rate in all respects, from Sharon's beautiful vocal performance and the guitars - which were all recorded in Holland, to the drumming - which was recorded in Belgium, to the full orchestra and choir - which were recorded in Russia, with each location being chosen for its individual capacity to contribute to this recording. It is obvious that no corners were cut in the production of this album, and it is clearly evident upon first listen, this album sounds magnificent. This album starts off brilliantly, has some even higher points along the way, and then ends even more brightly than it began. This is a very impressive and rewarding album, and has become one of my favorites. And for me this is very high praise to be sure, primarily because a band with a female singer will just about never make it to an album that I would rate as one of my favorites. However, this is certainly nothing against female singers, I just prefer the sound of a singer like Dio, Bruce Dickinson or Danny Bowes. (That doesn't make me gay does it?) And because of this preference if I had a single critical thing to say about this album it would be that at times Sharon's voice does get a bit on the high side. Conversely though, I am sure there are many that will enjoy this facet of her voice, and over and above any sound preference one might have, her vocals are always appropriate to the music. Furthermore, and far more worthy of mention is the fact that Sharon has an absolutely gorgeous voice, which easily rates as one of the best female Rock/Metal voices ever, not to mention she's pretty damn easy on the eyes. (Did I mention that I'm not gay? - Not that there's anything wrong with that.)<br /><br />Now, as is natural I suppose, I also feel compelled to compare this album to their previous album, 2001's 'Mother Earth', which some say is better. However, I would like to make it known that I actually own both albums, and have for quite some time now. Consequently I have no reservations in telling you that in my opinion, with all things carefully considered, this album is without question a better offering. But by only a small margin though, as 'Mother Earth' is also a fantastic album, and a fantastical album I might add, that in comparison I would rate 4.5 stars. I won't get into the differences here, because the differences are substantial, and it would take a bit of explaining. Just trust me when I say buy this album first, and if you like it (and you will like it) then buy 'Mother Earth'. But just be prepared to hear something much more imaginary and grandiose. FYI, I also own WT's latest album, 2007's 'The Heart Of Everything', another exceptional album which I would also rate 4.5 stars. And believe me, I am not indiscriminately doling out praise or being liberal or charitable, these albums have earned their ratings. I think three rock solid albums in a row is an amazing accomplishment, and damn near unheard of, but believe or not WT has done it, as there is no filler to be found on any of these albums!  And this amazing accomplishment certainly did not happen by accident, as Sharon said in an interview; \\"we do feel a lot of artistic pressure to write beautiful music\\" - \\"we are very critical of our music, a great deal of our ideas and songs are thrown away, and that's why it always takes us so long to write a new album\\". This is true, WT has only been releasing a new album once every three years. Which granted is a long time between offerings, but this should only be seen as something admirable, and deserving of praise, as releasing anoutstanding album every three years is without question a whole lot better than releasing a marginal album every year or so.<br /><br />In conclusion, this album, 'The Silent Force' is one of those albums that I just can't recommend more highly. Buy it now! I honestly don't see how anything but delight could be found. (Did I mention that I'm not gay?) :-)um every three years is without question a whole lot better than releasing a marginal album every year or so.    In conclusion, this album, 'The Silent Force' is one of those albums that I just can't recommend more highly. Buy it now! I honestly don't see how anything but delight could be found.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|Bravo, brother Neal.      You just have to admit that the organized church was corrupt.  Not only were the upper eschalon of the Catholic church murdering, torturing and persecuting in the name of dogma and political influence, they were keeping the faithful of the general public illiterate and uninformed.  This was the insult behind the tragedy.  Not only did Luther champion a correct doctrinal stance, but he attempted to put the Word of God in the hands of the common people.  This way the servant and the aristocrat could hold each other accountable to what the Bible said about sin and salvation.  Without the ability to open up your Bible and read for yourself what God has spoken in His eternal self-revelation, you and I are condemned to just blind ignorance and the tyranical whims of the power-hungry in the church.    The Protestant movement was the plot light of the literacy movement in that age.  Just like when Alexander the Great made \\"the whole world\\" speak, read and write Greek, it was really God setting the first century world up for the spreading of the Gospel.  And today, English is this international language (economics, medicine, science) with which God has set the modern world up to hear His Word again.      Illiteracy is how the Cathholic Chruch remained unchallenged and kept the masses ignorant in the things of God.  The people were crippled in defending themselves against the tyrany and unable to find the narrow road that leads to eternal life.  It's a good thing that \\"one of them\\" decided to expose the charade and, paying a the highest price, sparked the movement that would bring the light of the Word of God to the English speaking world.  Today there is no excuse.  You can buy a Bible at Walmart.  People in the civlized world are with out roadblock when it comes to the availability ot the word of God.  If you really want to know what God has said in the Bible, you can read it for yourself.        Sadly, today as I try to evangelize in a mostly Catholic city, I find the masses still ignorant about the Bible's requrements for salvation.  No one has had any idea of what being born again is, although Jesus states it is a requirement for entrance into the kingdom of God (John 3:3).  In over 13 years of being saved, I've had only one challenging conversation at work with a Catholic who actually quoted the Bible to support his beliefs.  Most Catholics I talk to remain in sin and out of touch with God because of family intimidation, sports-fan-type loyalty, and Biblical illiteracy...but rarely for anything as unique and genuine as a Biblical conversion, deliverance from the bondage sin, or a healing miracle in their body that can only be credited to God Himself.  Ceremony and tradition have replaced repentence and the genuine fruits of faith, as Jesus and John the Baptist would have noted.    Even more sad though, is the ammount of Protestant Christians that are just as illiterate and happily so.  Ther are people that know more about \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\" than the sanctified God-pleasing life.  They haven't enough Biblical fortitude to discern the modern \\"golden calf\\" message behind weak kneed \\"Christian\\" self-help gurus.  Christians today willingly buy into \\"Your Best Life Now\\" and other Christian Pop junk food instead of biblically striving for God's best life on His time table.  We are more content to be entertained and call it worship rather than listen to the word of God in an unpopular-but-biblical sermon that lasts longer than 20 minutes.  For shame.  If it keeps going this direction, we may have to \\"come out of her\\" again.    I'm glad for Neal Morse's sake that burning at the stake is illegal now.  Face up to the truth, people, don't be like Nazis that try to deny the Holocost.  There's no Catholic bashing here, just well-informed songwriting.  Why bash a Catholic when you can just get one saved?    Oh yeah, by the way, the music on this album is Neal's best yet.

B000KCHZK6|3.0|There are only a couple of songs on this collection that I enjoy. \\"Come Away With Me\\" is a better collection.
B000PT6OY2|5.0|I used to love bond movies. However, the increasingly bland, entirely predictable, and completely unrealistic bond movies we've been force fed the last decade had me not even wanting to watch them on DVD!    I was hesitant to go watch casino royale, fearing the same. Some unknown bond guy trying to fill big shoes, with a script probably tailored only to take advantage of the proliferation of texas holdem in a long shot try to entice more viewers.     Thank God I was wrong.     This movie is INCREDIBLE. Gone are the unrealistic \\"world destruction\\" devices, invisible cars/unrealistic gadgets, and story lines that want to make you hurl while you sit through them.     Craig portrays bond in an amazing light, and I believe him to be the best bond yet - better than even Connery, who I never believed would be toppled as Bond.     This is an exciting movie and is now one of my top 5 favorite movies.     It's saved the franchise in my eyes, and I can't wait for more movies like it with Craig fulfilling what every Bond fan has been yearning for - a truly great Bond actor.
B00025ETIW|4.0|I'm one of those people who started out in rock thinking anything mainstream is bad (because, let's face it, it usually is).  I listened to all my rock-snob friends who said MCR are emo crap and never gave them a chance.  Then one day I heard \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" on MTV and thought, \\"Now this is some good music.\\"  When I found out it was MCR I was immediately appalled and intrigued at the same time.  I went out and bought The Black Parade and immediately loved it.    After listening to the Three Cheers singles, I decided that MCR are amazing from going from Three Cheers to The Black Parade.  I thought the singles were mediocre at best, and definitely emo.  But then I listened to the rest of the album and I was plesantly surprised.  Though the entire album is pop-rock, and yes, still a bit emo, it really isn't a bad thing.  In the context of the album, the singles seem less emo and more mainstream, straight-up rock.  As a guitar player, I can respect Ray's playing a lot.  In a mainstream music industry where guitar solos are as rare as fat girls (more of both of these things would make me endlessly happy), hearing a good solo now and again is really refreshing and uplifting.    The highlights for me are \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\" which at first really just made me cringe at the melodrama.  But that comes with the territory with this band.  Also the other two singles (\\"Helena\\" and \\"Ghost of You\\"), plus my favorite, \\"Cemetary Drive.\\"  The rest of the songs are entertaining, and there isn't one that I don't like.  While some are forgettable and they all seem to run together after only a few listens, if you give the CD a chance you'll begin to distinguish between songs.    Though it's not nearly as good as The Black Parade, Three Cheers is a good solid CD.  Don't expect miracles, but it's better than what most rock-snobs give it credit for.  And that's coming from a fellow rock-snob.
B0000041Z6|4.0|I was a young high schooler when I bought this set.  When i heard all of these performances I was inspired and amazed at the power of mahler. Now 10 years later i will say my tastes have changed, and I have heard many other versions of mahler.  And while there are many amazing performances of all of mahler symphonies I still think this set is truely inspirational. With all that said i want to take the time to point out my new mahler passion. Abbado and the Lucerne festival orchestra and their ongoing mahler DVD project.     If you have the rescources and the money, I would suggest that you invest in this series. The performace of Symphony 5 is great and on par with many of the great performances. I still think Solti's 5th is the definitive recording, but the lucerne performance is still worth the money. And the \\"Ressurection\\" symphony is truely an inspiring performace. But it is the 7th symphony that is truely awe inspiring. I have never heard a performance so full of life and musicality. I cry everytime i hear it. I just ordered the new release of mahler's 6th symphony and i have high expectations as well.      Back to Solti's mahler. In my humble opinion the Recordings of 2, 3, 5, and 6 are definitive recordings. I have not come across another recording that I like better.  I would have said the same thing of the 7th until I heard Abbado's on DVD. Now it is my definitive 7th. The 8th is generally consididered difinitive as well and i won't argue at all, but i did recently come across a new recording on the naxos label with the Warsaw philharmanic and Antoni Wit conducting.  It is well worth checking out.  The ninth i fully admit is the symphony I am least familiar with.  I do however enjoy the recording here in the Solti set, but fully contest that there might be better out there.  So this leaves us with the 1st and 4th. The recordings in this set are fine recordings, but again there are probably better ones out there. One of my favorite 1st is one on the HarmoniMundi label, with the Florida Philharmonic and James Judd conducting, but I recently found out it is out of print. So if you come across a copy I highly recomend picking it up. So as for the 4th, I don't have any recording to recommend.     So my overall recommendation is if you wan't a great reference recording of the mahler symphonies this is the way to go.  I don't think there is another set out there that can compete with the solti version. I also say that if you can, expereince the ongoing mahler interprtations on DVD with Abbado and the lucerne festival Orchestra.
B000002P2W|3.0|The casual fan who scans the tracklist for The Who By Numbers will recognize only \\"Squeeze Box\\".  To most such listeners, this is a singable, harmless ditty. To this Who fan, it is the lamest single that they ever released. Even if we forgive the inclusion of this song, The Who By Numbers is still the band's weakest album since A Quick One.  This isn't a harsh criticism, since the nine intervening years between those two albums were stuffed with five of the best albums of the era, including one of the greatest live recordings in rock.  At worst, By Numbers is a mediocre album by Who standards. At best, it is a refreshing return to a more modest, song-based approach, and a fine capstone for a magnificent decade-long streak for The Who.<br /><br />By Numbers is invariably described as a confessional, singer/songwriter album, and several of the titles are indicative of the plaintive nature of many of the songs.  These songs account for the album's finer moments, especially \\"They Are All In Love\\" and \\"How Many Friends?\\".  \\"However Much I Booze\\" and \\"Blue, Red, and Grey\\" find Pete Townshend in fine voice, but neither are among the better songs on the album.  By Numbers does have some harder-rocking tracks, including \\"Slip Kid\\" and the John Entwistle-penned \\"Success Story\\", both of which are okay but unremarkable.  The album's closer, \\"In A Hand or A Face\\", is the best rocker on the album, and \\"Dreaming From the Waist\\" is another highlight, showcasing Roger Daltrey's voice in powerful but less testosterone-fueled form.<br /><br />It is easy to write off The Who By Numbers as for completists only. After all, it lacks the reputation and number of well-known songs that its predecessors have.  To do so would sell the record short. While I don't expect casual fans to eagerly seek it out, interested fans would be remiss to assume that The Who's creative well ran dry with Quadrophenia.  There are some excellent songs on By Numbers, a few of which could easily become personal favorites of anyone willing to give them a listen. (That said, I should mention that I am not particularly interested in anything after this album that isn't included on compilations or live albums.)willing to give them a listen.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|I found this movie a complete delight.  It was a story that I did not know and was absolutely captivated by the way this movie told it.  It captured late Victorian upper class society beautifully and the kind of family from which Beatrix Potter came very well.<br /><br />Yes, as all movies do, it took out a few poetic licenses, such as the fact she was 36 in 1902, not 32.  Also, the movie doesn't let us know that she had suffered from severe headaches and even fainting spells in her 20s, but still, the movie captures her wonderful eccentricities especially as they relate to her art.  Oh, and her brother, Rupert, was sent off to boarding school for his education.  However, he is out of the movie quite early and only referred to in passing.<br /><br />The love that develops between Beatrix (about my favorite performance ever from Renee Zellweger) and Norman Warne (touchingly done by Ewan McGregor) is charmingly done and involves us though we see it coming.  A key role in the film is Norman's sister, Millie (very well played by Emily Watson).  She is the real ground for Beatrix in the movie, I do not know the real life relationship between the two.  They have similar life experiences in being women of proper upper middle class late-Victorian households who did not find a suitable marriageable partner when young.  It is a fascinating friendship.  Just beware of anachronistically foisting our time's ridiculous views of same sex friendships on those times.<br /><br />I also think that the actors playing Beatrix's parents deserve real praise.  The father, Rupert (Bill Paterson), is an indulgent man who wishes deep down he had been an artist, but to be a proper Englishman of his time and of the class he desired, he had to take up the law.  However, he never practices it and spends his days at his club.  He is kind to Beatrix, but doesn't take her seriously until he has to.  The mother, Helen (Barbara Flynn), is a thoroughly conventional woman of her time with all the social ambition the family will ever need.  However, she hasn't a single clue about what a tremendous talent Beatrix is or her art.  Helen views Beatrix as really as something the family must bear and try to fix, however difficult that might be.  She is kind hearted and loving and has ambitions for her family, but if something has no social utility it is lost on her.<br /><br />A fine film and a great family film.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Frankly, I was delighted to see these stars shine without the usual gratuitous disrobing, blood, or foul language.  I actually found this visit to Victorian times a wonderful respite from the decadence of our time.ill ever need.

B00005JNBQ|2.0|After many students have inquired, I decided to watch Napoleon Dynamite.    I must say, I found this movie to be rather pointless. I didn't necessarily find it stupid, but I didn't like it.    Many of my students liked it, but I think it is because they were laughing at Napoleon because he was, what we commonly call, a loser. I just kind of found it sad that Napoleon was so picked on. I have become increasingly sensitive to that in my old age.    I just see a lot of kids like Napoleon, I think most of us have been Napoleon, and it is sad. Maybe that's the point? That we shouldn't pick on people. I just wish students would get that too.
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|Oh people...this has NO redeeming features except extraordinary chemistry between always-cute-and-sexy Hugh Grant and remarkably-focused Drew Barrymore in a simply silly but very lovely tale of a self-proclaimed has-been Eighties rocker (Grant)who commandeers his plant-care lady (Barrymore) to write some lyrics he badly needs in 48 hours.<br /><br />And why does he need these lyrics? Because the greatest female pop icon of all time, Cora (played brilliantly by newcomer Haley Bennett, hilarious as a cross between Britney Spears and Christine Aguilerra) has invited him to join her on her upcoming world tour--IF he can write the \\"perfect song.\\" This would mean goodbye to performances at county fairs--goodbye to has-been-hood and hello to resurrected rock-hood!<br /><br />Can they do it? Can they write THE song when they only know each other's names, are completely different in age, temperament, and just about everything else? Hey--this is Hollywood.<br /><br />Just fun all the way through, and the songs (both from Grant's mythical Eighties band \\"Pop\\" and his \\"new\\" hits) are actually catchy. Very enjoyable.
B000683VI4|4.0|I've always been a sucker for the sappy tear-jerkers.  I don't know what more I can say in defense other than the fact that I like to be moved to tears.  It's a good emotion and it's one that us men too often flee from rather than embrace.  That said, as much as this film conventionally falls into genre typecasting and fails to really add too much to the same broken record of the `boy meets girl, boy loves girl, parents ruin everything' synopsis of almost every post-`Romeo&Juliet' romance film, it still has so much good in it that I'm forced to defend it's honor.  For one thing it's one of the most beautifully shot films I've seen in a long time.  Director Nick Cassavetes does a brilliant job in capturing the feel of the film, the subtle beauty within the environment that only illuminates the subtle beauty of the films stars.<br /><br />The story may be regurgitated teen romance, but it's sweet to say the least.  The poor boy, rich girl visa-versa concept is tired and worn by now, but it seems to be the catalyst for just about every romance film to date so we just have to get used to the idea that original ideas don't exist anymore.  They do, they are just hard to come by.  The film opens with Duke, played by James Garner, visiting Allie, played by Cassavetes mother Gena Rowland, in a nursing home.  She's suffering from Alzheimer's and he comes to read to her.  He reads her a story of young love that blossomed into so much more.  It becomes apparent that this story is actually the story of how Duke, or Noah, met Allie, how they fell in love, drifted apart and then ultimately were drawn back together.<br /><br />As Duke reads to Ally we meet their younger selves.  Noah Calhoun, played by the electric Ryan Gosling, is a blue collar lumberyard worker who falls for the young, and very rich, Allie Hamilton, played by Rachel McAdams.  The two get off to a rocky start but soon become inseparable.  Noah proves to be an escape for Allie, an escape from the normal routine of having everything decided for her and never being allowed to decide for herself what's best.  Allie lives under the strict thumb of her parents, namely her mother.  After a falling out instigated by Allie's parents the two become separated for seven years, in the meantime Allie goes on to become engaged to another man and Noah goes on to purchase his dream home and restore it to the home he promised Allie.  Shortly before her wedding Allie finds Noah's face in the paper and decides to see him one last time.<br /><br />We all know how the story ends, at least for the younger couple.  The ending for the older couple is not as dreamy but equally as moving.  What really makes this movie work is the chemistry between the cast.  Ryan Gosling is a brilliant actor, always has been, and here he is brooding with sex appeal and charm.  Rachel McAdams is convincing as seventeen year old Allie, and while I'm not so convinced by her adult version she still does a fine job shuffling her onscreen accent and trying to stand out next to Gosling.  James Garner is fantastic here and Gena Rowland is impressive.  Surprisingly, as much as this could be labeled chick flick, it's the two male leads that bring the most to the table.  Garner's breakdown scene towards the end of the film is heartbreakingly realistic, and Gosling devotes enough charm into his character to make him real and alive.<br /><br />`The Notebook' may be just another in a long line of sappy teen romance films with the same or very close to the same premise, but it deserves some sort of recognition for sporting a deserving cast and a beautiful canvas for which they are exposed.  The script is well written and based on a very well known and much loved Nicholas Sparks novel.  My wife claims to prefer the film to the book, but she's never been too much of a reader.  I can't say which is greater since I have not read the novel myself, but I can say with certainty that the film adaptation is splendidly entertaining and invested with enough charm and sentiment to make up for it's blatant unoriginality.ed with enough charm and sentiment to make up for it's blatant unoriginality.
075640407X|5.0|Name of the Wind is nothing less than the best book written in the last 10+ years.  Its been a long time since a new author showed up that knew how to tell a story this way.  An author who actually knows what a story is and what goes into creating one of this caliber.    If your tastes in reading run to the likes of Card, Goodkind, Weis, Hickman, Brooks, Donaldson, Eddings...Get this book, you'll soon find Kvothe standing in good company with Ender, Bean, Petra, Dink, Zed, Kahlan, Richard, Gratch, Haplo, Tas, Raistlain, Flint, Hugh, Shea, Col, Par, Wil, Thomas, Garion, Pol, Belgarth...    NotW grabs you from the inner blub, The first page sucks you in before you know it, you've hit page 200 and your Wife is yelling at you its time for breakfast all you'll be late for work.  The book is that good.   But keep in mind this is only the beginning, there is more coming and you'll be felt with a dull ache waiting for it.

0783225849|5.0|It's well worth it NOT to learn anything at all about the plot of this movie before you watch it. Part of the fantastic thrill of watching the tale unwind is learning the ins and outs of what is going on. You probably already know the keynote situation - a knife in a shower scene - but luckily that comes early on, so you don't spend half the movie wondering what it is all about.    Many aspects make this movie spectacular and worthy of the #18 AFI top movie rating. The black and white filming makes every shadow and corner suspect. It's not a movie about gore and blood - in fact many scenes deliberately scare you without showing you what actually is going on. Your imagination supplies the activity. It's more a movie about nerves - about wondering what is going to happen, worrying about consequences.    You can tell how amazing a movie is when, many decades later, a new director works to make a scene-by-scene reproduction of the movie with modern actors, just to help bring the story to a new generation. Viggo Mortensen fans are familiar with this one.    Highly recommended.
B00005JPPL|5.0|I love time manipulation movies. This Cage movie is not oscar worthy but well worth the ticket price!
B00003CXCW|5.0|Number 12 on the AFI list of top movies of all times, there are many reasons why this 1950 movie about a fading silent-screen starlet still has the power to move people in modern times. First, with the basics - the actors are superb, the plot is fascinating, and the sets are stunning. You really do believe you're in the decaying remnants of a movie star's mansion.    In many ways, this movie plays out as an autobiography. The lead actress is in fact a famous silent screen heroine. Max is played by a director who worked with her on several movies. Many famous individuals from that era - Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, and others - play themselves. There's a reason the story is so poignant. Actresses really DO get passed over once they age. Even half a century later, in modern times, fantastic actresses get fewer and fewer parts once they cross a certain line.    You only have to look at modern day tabloids to see how this exact same situation - an older actress taking up with a younger man - is treated with derision and laughter. The actresses are supposed to accept their situation - give up on any good parts, forget about any appreciation, and retire to a quiet farm somewhere.    The movie hints constantly at what a fine actress the main character was. Directors speak fondly of her. Other actors and actresses swarm around to talk with her. The photos and film clips of her show how beautiful and unique she was. One has to wonder how she might have turned out if she had been allowed to continue to play fantastic roles, appropriate to her age, as she went from 20 to 30 to 40.    Highly recommended, not only as a look at what Hollywood was like back in its formative years, but also as an interesting commentary on how Hollywood in general treats its female stars.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|wow i didn't think they would be able to top the first season but they did!!!.  veronica is back fighting crime again. i carn't wait for season 3
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Irresistible film brings off far-fetched premise with warmth and charm. Hanks excels as man-boy Josh, and Robert Loggia is also terrific as the toy magnate who mentors him. But it's John Heard who has a comic field day playing Paul, a suspicious, resentful colleague who loses ground professionally and personally to Josh, as both his boss and girlfriend Susan (Perkins) reject him for this wunderkind who came out of nowhere. Don't miss the priceless scene where Josh and Susan have their first \\"sleep-over\\".
B000A59PMO|5.0|what a top show!! veronica is a sexy teenage girl trying to get on with her life whilst fighting crime aswell.
6305252572|5.0|Putting a thrilling new spin on the buddy film with this gritty and gripping crime drama, director Walter Hill hit paydirt, combining Nolte's bearish, no-BS mien with fiery comedic talent Murphy (still a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" cast member at the time). The result is a witty, well-acted, suspenseful thriller featuring a warring, hilariously mismatched duo. Great chemistry, intelligent writing, and wonderful set-ups (especially one tense howler in a racist redneck bar) boost \\"48 Hrs.\\" to the top rank of '80s urban actioners. Exciting and full of attitude.
B000002UC5|5.0|I imagine that there is no other pop musician who polarizes music lovers more than Paul McCartney. I was in the opposite camp from McCartney lovers for quite a few years;for me Lennon and Harrison were IT!  However,i have been revisting Macca's Beatles and solo material and I now believe myself to have  treated him rather unfairly.  Is there anyone out there who can write such simple and beautiful melodies? Maybe there is and since I am 52 I may not be aware of some youngster out there who is of equal ability as Mac.  This LP came out w/ Let it Be and I believed that Mac was the one to blame for the breakup of t he Beatles,so I bought this Lp and then spent alot of energy dissing it to my friends,but I suppose all the while I was a closeted Macca fan and did not want to admit it.  This album is full of quality material,if crudely recorded,that only adds to it's charms.   Like i said in an earlier review of another Mac CD,every one of Mac's solo pop CDs/LPs has at least one killer song #1 with a bullet on it.  Mac just seems to be able to pluck them out of the air like so many golden apples,while lying back on the country grass in complete repose.  One reviewer said the \\"Glasses\\" is eerie. Well, in case nobody has mentioned it on this thread,\\"Glasses\\" is actually Paul and Linda playing/rubbing the rims of variously filled water glasses.  Paul was into avant-garde sound/music long before Lennon.  I believe Paul will be remembered as a composer/musician on par with the classical crowd of the 18th and 19th centuries,if for nothing than his remarkable melodic gift and great production and execution that is evident on most of his pop/rock recordings.  I feel lucky to have been born and to have grown up w/ his music.  History will bear out the fact that Lennon and McCartney were of a rare origin.There won't be their like to grace our ears and lives for many generations to come,if at all.  Thanks,God.
B000053V7O|5.0|avernier's vivid, sensitive ode to the brilliant exile musicians who flocked to his country in the fifties to escape racism (and find a more appreciative fan base) might well be the greatest jazz film of all time. Dedicated to Bud Powell and Lester Young, \\"Midnight\\" lovingly evokes the mood and atmosphere of the bebop scene (Herbie Hancock's Oscar-winning score was recorded live, on the set), as well as the dark and murky mindset of many of its practitioners. Adding to the authenticity, Tavernier cast real-life musicians to fill the roles, including sax great Gordon, who received an Oscar nomination for his devastating portrayal of the laconic, raspy-voiced Turner.
B0009X766Y|5.0|George Roy Hill's reprise with Newman and Redford (after \\"Butch Cassidy\\") once again comes up a winner. Vivid 1930s period detail and a sublime Scott Joplin ragtime score add flavor to a wildly entertaining, twisty yarn that plays out like a perfect sleight-of-hand trick. Even we the audience aren't in on the whole picture. Newman and Redford recapture the chemistry of their earlier outing, and Shaw makes an ideal villain/victim. Charles Durning also stands out as a sleazy, crooked cop. Grade A entertainment, suitable for older kids.
B00005JPLW|4.0|The advertisements for this film did not entice me to see it.  It was word of mouth that brought me to the theater to see it on the big screen.  And I wasn't disappointed.  It was probably just as well that I didn't know going in that it was from a graphic novel.  That might have quelled my interest.  Especially upon seeing the special effects in those ads.    Although the filmmakers -- and the writers of the novel -- took liberties with the story, there was enough of the original history of Thermopylae to maintain interest.  The actors were well chosen.  The artwork and special effects were unique and worked as part of the story rather than as just stuck in there because it could be done.    The biggest disappointment would have been predictable had I known of the origins of the story.  Xerxes, the Persian ruler, was so monstrous that when he first appeared on screen, he drew the viewer out of the story.  Unfortunately, he was laughable, and the story became too cartoonish.  I was glad I went to see it.  I just wish the quality of story and characterization had been maintained throughout.
B000063JDE|5.0|This hallucinogenic mystery-thriller from cult director Lynch explores the twisted underside of small-town American life, fusing noirish elements of mood and atmosphere with a classic Hitchcockian whodunit. Lynch's imprint is everywhere, including MacLachlan's deliberately trancelike acting, Rossellini's melodramatic distress, and Hopper's over-the-top turn as the angry, liquid-ether-huffing sadist who has a strange and violently sexual hold on Dorothy. Even the music--the Bobby Vinton song and Angelo Badalamenti's eerie score--completes the director's disquieting effect. Filmed in gorgeous Technicolor, \\"Blue Velvet\\" is a lurid parable about innocence and evil film that mystery/noir fans will find irresistible. (Also check out Dean Stockwell's sublime, campy turn as one of Frank's odd-ball colleagues!)
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Sorry all the other 5 star folks said it all.  My husband and I both enjoy John Wayne movies, and we both like this one!
B0000844MV|5.0|Originally a 210-minute German mini-series edited down to feature length, \\"Boot\\" is haunting and works as an anti-war piece precisely because it is seen from the losing side. German actor Jurgen Prochnow turns in an intense portrayal of the boat's desperate captain. The film's other star--Peterson's camera--roves through the sub fluidly, never allowing the viewer a breath of escape or boredom.
B000NA28I4|1.0|How anyone could sleep at night after ruining such an incredible story is beyond me. This is just another money making scheme hugging on the coattails of something great. If you haven't read the book I don't know that you could follow such a jumbled story with gaping holes and no character development, and if you read the book chances are you wanted to cry after seening this film as I did. Shame on you Fangmeier. READ THE BOOKS, SAVE YOUR MONEY!
B00012FXAE|5.0|James Cameron's big-budget, special-effects-driven sequel to Ridley Scott's \\"Alien\\" might lack the carefully orchestrated tension of its predecessor, but its unrelenting pace and Weaver's smart, tough performance carry the film into its own nightmare orbit. Essentially an action film pitting a squad of scared, trigger-happy grunts against a teeming nest of truly frightening monsters, \\"Aliens\\" benefits from its superb small cast--including Lance Henriksen and comic Paul Reiser playing against type as a devious corporate slime-ball--as well as director Cameron's breathless pacing and air-tight direction. Just wait til Mother arrives!
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I stumbled upon Amy Winehouse through a music profile on a friend's myspace page. The song was \\"Back To Black\\" from the same-titled recent release.     I was completely blown away by the sound. Her voice is like silk over the tripped up beats and rehash of the 1960's.     I looked deeper into her book of work and picked up \\"Frank\\". While \\"Back to Black\\" is a flawless piece of work... \\"Frank\\" is simply perfection. It's much simplier but in it's simplicity lies it's beauty. She allows the beats to remain scarce so that her voice is the anchor to each song.    This album is definitely worth hunting for.
B000O76T90|5.0|John McTiernan's \\"Die Hard\\" not only retooled the conventions of the modern action-thriller with its wisecracking lone-wolf cop, it also boosted \\"Moonlighting\\" star Bruce Willis from smug TV gumshoe to A-list actor. Willis operates his campaign against Gruber's super-thieves with clever booby traps and a lot of cheeky macho chatter, via a \\"borrowed\\" walkie-talkie, while McTiernan makes the most out of the setting--an unfinished corporate skyscraper. Rickman's wonderfully sinister turn as a haughty villain only adds to the excitement. For fans of clever, stunt-heavy, heart-racing suspense, \\"Die Hard\\" will never expire.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This band is the most talented band out there! It is nice to hear a band that is not afraid to write a song that last longer than 3 minutes. This album is loaded with songs well over 5 minutes without having to be repetitive. This along with every other TOOL album deserves 5 stars.
6305511055|5.0|Pollack's tense spy thriller ranks as one of the best conspiratorial dramas of the '70s, a time when government mistrust was at an all-time high. Redford is in his prime as baffled, low-level spook Turner, and the sparks fly with co-star Dunaway, whose initial terror and eventual thawing happen with finesse and subtlety. With excellent supporting turns by Max Von Sydow and Cliff Robertson, \\"Condor\\" delivers gripping suspense all the way.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|LOST is one of the most creative shows on television.  No matter how mundane a particular show is, I feel each and everyone has something to contribute to the solving overall mystery of the island and the people.  I am just enjoying the ride.  Just like life, there are peaks and valleys.  Watching the DVD is the best way to go, since you can immediately see the next episode, sans commercials. I watched the whole first season on DVD after the second season had already begun, then got caught up, and am still hooked.  LOST is the only show I will NOT miss each week...even if I must record it. My son will be home from Christmas after having been deployed to Iraq, so the timing of the 3rd season is perfect for late nights with my son, as he catches up.
B00006DEFA|5.0|A marvelously acted, flawlessly directed story about jealousy, obsession, and perfectionism, Forman's stunning \\"Amadeus\\" mixes suspenseful drama with historical fact to create a winning fictional biography. The lead actors inhabit their roles with gusto, with Hulce's crass talent playing off Abraham's guileful Salieri with great results. Neville Marriner brings Mozart's music to vigorous life. Winning Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (Abraham), \\"Amadeus\\" is a triumph that will delight anyone with a soft spot for cracked genius.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|WOW!!!   i listened to the first couple songs on my cd player in my truck and thought this is awesome. then i came home and put on my headphones and closed me eyes and listened the whole disc. OMFG. i was blown away. and that was the first listen. cd's usually grow on me. i heard a review by a couple people from rolling stone magazine and they didn't have much good to say about it. maybe thier WHAM cd jaded them. anywho.... this is by far kelly's most rockin' album yet. i think i read something that said she's thinking about doing a full on country record. oh kelly please don't. not that i don't like country. this kinda music just suites her so well. so if you wanna rock and also be move by her beautiful voice on the ballads,this one is awesome.   YOU GO GIRL!!!
B000A2IPP0|5.0|Spielberg creates movie magic with this warm-hearted yet gripping fantasy tale. ET himself is a creative marvel, the cutest, most non-threatening alien in sci-fi history. The child actors are uniformly good, particularly Thomas and the beguiling Barrymore. \\"ET\\" ingeniously turns science-fiction conventions on their head, as the earthling grown-ups are the bad guys, and the alien, the hero. Larger-than life emotion (and tension) elevate this film to timeless family classic, aided by another majestic John Williams score.
B000OVLBIU|4.0|This Film is great for action and being made in my hometown helped. But to my surprise the quality of the blu ray was adverage. Extended bits not realy needed.
6304696515|5.0|\\"Liaisons\\" had been filmed before (Roger Vadim did a modern-day version in 1960) and would be again (1989's \\"Valmont\\" and 1999's \\"Cruel Intentions\\"), but this is the best of the lot, boasting a lush production, and a deliciously wicked performance from Close. Malkovich, though not handsome enough for the Valmont role, injects a sly, predatory sexuality that compensates nicely. Pfeiffer has never been better (or prettier), and watch for the vision of budding womanhood that is Uma Thurman. A clever, eye-filling treat.
6302453356|1.0|My son disliked it so much he turned it off halfway thru.  Very misguided work.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|The multiple-Oscar-winning \\"Gandhi\\" explores the life and principles of an extraordinary man who became an enduring example of holiness, humility, and humane resistance. Ben Kingsley inhabits his role with saintly authority, brilliantly conveying Gandhi's charisma and unwavering courage, while Candice Bergen (as photographer Margaret Bourke-White) and John Gielgud (as Lord Irwin) also shine in their respective roles. Melodramatic epic sequences--especially the Salt March and massacre scenes, which required Attenborough to direct 300,000 extras--are handled with graceful verisimilitude. A deeply moving, masterful epic.
0060557818|4.0|I don't know whether it's Gaiman's writing alone or the imaginary space he created for this novel, but I simply can't stop thinking about London Below.  I lived in London for a while and had heard about the unused platforms upon which the author presumably loosely based his narrative.  His version fits nicely within what many people thought must happen in those tunnels.  No complaints from me about [[ASIN:0060557818 Neverwhere: A Novel]] structure, characters, or style.  Gaiman's humour is clever and just in the right doses for the story.  OK, here's a complaint: I hated being captivated by the bad guy...or, in this case, the bad guys.  Croup and Vandemar are detestable, but for some reptilian reason, they're fascinating.  This novel alone has prompted me to read more from this author.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|Jointly scripted by Robert Towne (\\"Chinatown\\") and Paul Schrader (\\"Taxi Driver\\"), this riveting East-meets-West action thriller is expertly handled by Pollack, and features great, low-key acting by a haggard-looking, middle-aged Mitchum. With its twin themes of honor and guilt, \\"Yakuza\\" certainly belongs in the Schrader canon, and the story arc is boosted immensely by sword expert Takakura's explosive run-ins with Japanese thugs. Keiko Kishi provides excellent support, too, as Mitchum's long-ago lover, and their interactions give the whole film a rueful air of regret. Few films of the action genre are as soulfully felt, or ring so sorrowfully true.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|As I missed most of the first Season of Supernatural when it aired on TV, I was thrilled to be able to order and watch all the S1 Episodes I'd missed, by purchasing the S1 DVD on [...].    For me, personally, my favourite item on the S1 dvd set of spn, S1 was the outtake or gag or blooper reel, I haven't laughed so much, for a very long time.    I'd recommend this DVD set to anyone who likes: spn, jensen ackles, jared padalecki, outtakes, bloopers, gags, dean winchester, sam winchester, john winchester.
B000002LEU|5.0|I purchased this album on a lark because an ex-boyfriend has loved them and so I wanted to check them out. I absolutely love this record! My favorite songs are Digital and She's Lost Control. I listen to this when I'm cleaning my apt. because it gets me energized.
B00068ULLY|5.0|...to an era-gone-by.  I won't make this wordy, because I feel that other users have written reviews that more than amply describe the details of this two-part cinematic masterpiece.  Everything in this movie, and I mean /everything/ is the ghostly image of something from the golden age of kung-fu cinema poured through the imaginative filter of Quentin Tarantino's mind and stylized to the point of near-absurdity.  Even so, it is just this almost-insane pacing and imagery that makes the movie.  The dialogue is tight and razor-sharp, contrary to a few comments.  What you must understand, is that it is being written in a manner specifically characterizing that which it parodies.  Tarantino clearly loves kung-fu cinema.  You can feel it in every frame, no matter what is happening on screen.  I have loved it as well, and I hope that many more will give this classic the chance it deserves.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I discovered this artist when iTunes had her single \\"Love Song\\" as their download of the week.  After listening to the song I was extremely impressed and went searching for more of her music.  The Little Voice CD did not disappoint! My wife and I each have a copy in our cars and can't wait to hear what's next from Sara.  Give this CD a listen and you won't be dissapointed.
0393061310|5.0|There are not many books that are able to change one's outlook on certain issues, but this one has it for me. Biologist Jared Diamond's book asks why the people of Eurasia have ended up dominating all over the world. His explanations are ingenious and compelling: because Eurasia has an east-west axis (unlike Africa and the Americas, which has a north-south axis) inventions in agriculture in one place in the vast continent could diffuse to another with little difficulty. The exchange in agricultural innovations would later make way for future diffusions of technology, giving the continent a technological edge over other continents. Also, there was an abundance of plants and animals suitable for domestication in Eurasia. This would eventually favor population growth and urban settlement in Eurasia, unlike the other continents that remain sparsely populated. Living in settlements with people like him and domestic animals give way to plagues in Eurasia, but also, eventually, to people immunized against many germs. This meant than when the indigenous inhabitants of the American continent met the European invaders, they were decimated more by their germs than by their guns. Diamond's thesis had been very useful to me in understanding some of today's conflicts: for example, why the Arab-Israeli has persisted until today (this is not in the book, I'm just elaborating on his ideas). My guess is that the first Israeli settlers in Palestine thought the Arabs would be a bit like the American Indians, soon disappearing from the land and giving way to a superior civilization; yet Jews and Arabs are both Eurasians (and close cousins, at that) so the Jewish superiority over the Arabs ended up being only temporary and receding (I'm not very optimistic about the future of Israel, given the demographic trends).  Overall, Diamond can be considered a believer in geographical determinism. This view was common in the West before Darwin and Mendel's discoveries made way for biological explanations between the various peoples, yet Diamond's arguments are very persuasive. Some people in the genes-are-everything crowd have criticized Diamond for dismissing the possibility of biological differences among the different ethnic groups (specifically on intelligence, which is really the thing people fear most). Diamond does not believe there are significant differences on intelligence between hunter-gatherers such as those he is familiar with on New Guinea and people on the developed world; it's just that the intelligence of the New Guineans is focused on such things as on how to get food from the hostile jungle environment, and this, of course does not get captured by standard intelligence tests. Here, though, I don't think why both geographical and genetic explanations cannot work together.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Fantastic performance and amazing production, especially on the remastered and extended version of this classic album. Crank it up on large speakers and it's just like being at a Who concert.
B000GBEWHA|4.0|Remember those school productions of \\"Grease\\" - well this is the film that everyone remembers, based on the long-running Broadway show.<br /><br />The songs are deliberately cheesy, the acting over the top, the teenagers look about 30, but it's all pretty good fun.<br /><br />Comparing this to \\"High School Musical\\", which has real teenagers one realises that \\"Grease\\" is not about teenagers at all but a 1950s that probably never existed. Indeed \\"Grease\\" was part of the 1950s nostalgia phenomenon of the 1970s along with \\"Happy Days\\" and \\"American Graffiti\\" that continued with films such as \\"Back to the Future\\" and \\"Stand By Me\\" in the 1980s. America was harking back to a kinder, simpler, innocent era post-Vietnam, Civil Rights, and Watergate.<br /><br />\\"Grease\\" still holds up as decent entertainment today.
B0007NFL18|2.0|I'm going to keep this short and simple. The truth is, the material on this CD isn't the best from 50 Cent. There are a few good songs that you can listen to over and over, most of the beats on the CD are pretty good, and basically that is it. If you are a \\"gangster\\" or a person who likes to play loud rap music in their car, this is for you. If you don't fall into this category, I'm sorry, but you'll end up being quite disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Simply the best show on TV. I'm sure I speak for others when I say that it's heartbreaking that this show never had the opportunity to show how great it could be. Be warned: for those of you that this show speaks to, you may come away angry and with a knot in your stomach when you realize you've watched the last episode. Join the campaign to bring it back if you experience these emotions.
B0006GAI82|5.0|This third part of the sequel was a fantastic revival of the desperate state of things, that featured the first one.<br /><br />New York city will be the huge stage, in which a crude vengueance will be taken over. A gelid and smart terrorist (the extraordinary actor Jeremy Irons) will display a sinister plan with a double intention, to redeem the death of his brother, and on the other hand to make of New York city a city under the waters.<br /><br />The dynamic stages, delirious action of this saga really involves even the most exigent spectator. There's a lot of action, and in this opportunity, Samuel Jackson was the perfect counterbalance working out as support officer of Bruce.<br /><br />The ceaseless action sequences, the intriguing atmosphere and the sinister presence of Irons adds a special factor for this superb script, hovered by a tense cloud of uncertaineness from start to finish.<br /><br />A solid script, a superb cast and a delirious camerawork join forces to bring us one of themost vibrant and absorbing thrillers of the Nineties.<br /><br />Go for this one!
B000002NIW|5.0|I consider myself as a diehard deftones fan. I honestly can say that I enjoy anything that is produced by them. I think \\"around the fur\\" is the first cd I've owned by def as far as I can remember. I love the sound they have on this release. Its signature def and I can't get over it. This album still gives me the chills.
B00064ADR0|5.0|This is in my opinion the best JW cd of them all. The bonus tracks are absolutly must haves. This is one of the best blues/rock album you will find.
B00004Z400|5.0|As I remember, it took me awhile to get used to \\"White Pony\\" when it first came out. I was still stuck on \\"Around the Fur\\" and the def had all \\"grown up\\". I've caught up to it though and have to say that this is one of the most hypnotic albums I've heard. The blend of mood and rage really does it for me. This album made me the diehard def fan that I am today. I enjoy every track on this cd and everyone should definitely own this.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I never watched this when it was actually on tv, but I saw parts of season 3 and just had to see season 1+2 so I bought both and loved both! The show is funny and suspenseful and just all around great! It became my fav show...too bad it isn't coming back for a 4th season...I wish it was!

B00005MP58|5.0|I agree with every other woman in the English speaking (and perhaps even farther than that) world... Colin Firth is well, AMAZING.  That aside, the characters in this A&E production are so well acted with such unique voices that you'll never read the book again without seeing Mr. Bingley's big and constant smile, or hearing Mr. Collins' condescending nasal or Mrs. Bennett's high-pitched complaints of \\"flutterings\\".  Other more recent versions have cut out those elements of the character development that make these people so watchable.  It is a movie I watch over and over every year.  And, may I say, it isn't just for women.  Every man I know that has braved this \\"chic flic\\" has enjoyed it.  Please watch this...you're reading of Austen will never be the same again.  It is just a good movie.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Thank You for Smoking is a delicious politically incorrect film that pokes fun at our knee-jerk PC nature in the most unlikely of ways. Taking the most demonized now of our society's legal but dangerous products, the cigarette, through Nick Naylor, the lead lobbyist for the tobacco industry in Washington, D.C. the film provokes thought about how we judge people.<br /><br />Instead of playing Naylor as simply an overly slick salesman, the story shows Naylor, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, as a committed father trying to create a better relationship with his son. Through this dedicated parenting we see the smiling lobbyist as a real person fighting the good fight for a losing side. An air of admiration actually takes hold for Naylor as everyone does have bills to pay. Therefore the movie is littered with points of view that in an entertaining fashion reveal how ludicrous much of our condemnation is towards what most people understand to be a dangerous product. Naylor is clearly fantastic at the game of spin, but so is everyone else who is in the game of trying to shape public opinion. Therefore even the public servant trying to put a skull and cross bones on cigarette packs or the dying cancer victim railing against the tobacco industry is revealed to be very good at the same manipulations and/or carry the same self-centered motivations as a skilled tobacco lobbyist.<br /><br />The questions then that Thank You For Smoking keeps asking is when has our scorn towards Naylor gone too far, as every good argument does need a counter-argument.
B00004RGUI|5.0|Another winner among Gibson´s productions.  Songbirds at Sunrise, Piano Songbirds, Appalachian Mountain Suite and Forest Guitar are also highly recommended
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a video that every person in the country, maybe world, should see.  I have bought copies for all my children.  This is such an important topic.  It affects the world that our children and grandchildren will inherit.  Buy this film.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This documentary deserves more than 5 stars along with The Living Planet.  The video quality and the cinematography are fascinating. The musical arrangements also deserve a special commendation. However, I experienced that the sound quality of Mr. Attenborough's narration was poor. Quite often it sounded like vibrating or having an echo. This flaw should be improved in future editions. I felt the need to really turn up the volume and modify the equalizer to be able to understand his words. Had it not been for the subtitles, I would have been dissapointed. Otherwise, this is an incredible production!.  Close-ups are incredible and time-lap photography is, for the lack of better words, breathtaking!    A must have for all nature lovers or \\"biophiles\\".    Disc number 5 explores the dangers many creatures are facing despite corageous and passionate efforts from conservationists in order to save them.  The threat of extinction is overwhelming, it really brings tears to your eyes...... We take everything for granted, and meanwhile entire species are wasting away under our noses. Why can't we appreciate what nature offers without destroying it?  Why do we have to wait until all those wonderful creatures and forests are wiped out of the planet before getting the message? And after most forests are gone, water sources are polluted, the air is toxic and the animals are extinct, what will the future be like for humans.............???      Congratulations to the BBC for this excellent series.
0385486804|5.0|This slim account of the quixotic life and tragic death of Chris McCandless is a remarkable book. I was transfixed by this story, one that chronicled the wanderings and explorations of a young man across the American West and into the wild of the Alaskan interior.     I found the book moved me in ways I hardly expected. This is surely a testament to the skilled and sensitive writing of Krakauer. He was able to transport me into the beauty and terror of this man's trek through desert, mountains, and taiga. I am an urban creature, who only on occasion has traveled the guided trail in a state park. Yet, I was swept along in the wake of McCandless's more exotic and often times harrowing trails through places like Detrital Wash, Arizona, Carthage, South Dakota and Stampede Trail, Alaska. As detailed an eye Krakauer has in making the flora and fauna of the West come alive for the reader, it is the human story of yearning and loss that made this much more than a tale of man alone in the wilderness.     Krakauer could have sold many copies of this story without probing the depths and mysteries of Chris McCandless's life. Instead, the author served up a complex potrtrait of a young man in his 20s estranged from his parents and hell bent on his search for truth and an unfettered life free from his suburban Washington D.C. upbringing and the rules and regulations of modern society. This story easily could have lapsed into a cliched tale of another On the Road Kerouac figure or a latter day Thoreau seeking self-discovery. While there are elements of these types in the character of McCandless, Krakauer draws a much more complex and compelling person for us to ponder.     At times I wanted to shake McCandless and tell him what the hell was he doing abrubtly leaving his family and cutting off all ties with former friends as he sought a purer, freer life. How self-absorbed and typically adolescent of him to be so wrapped up in his own angst to ignore the friends and family heleft behind. Yet, as Krakauer deftly demonstrates McCandless was capabale of great compassion and a sense of responsibility when he met up with a variety of characters along the way. I was especially moved by the tender and caring relationship fostered between him and an 80 year old man in the desert of the Southwest. McCandeless engendered affection, concern, and endearment in a lonely soul still grieving for his own son killed in an automobile accident. The fact that McCandless has to move on and leave behind the offers of emotional and financial assistance evokes more pathos than anger in the reader. Time and time again McCandless has a beguiling charm on the people he meets and the caring relationships he makes in the borderlands of the West. At these moments I wanted to hug McCandless and be a brother to him, affriming his need to explore and search while also reminding him that people need him and he needs the human community despite all of its shortcomings.     Yet, McCandless seems destined to go his own way, ignoring both the advice of seasoned travellers he meets along the way as well as the admomishments of the readers of this story such as myself who begin to deeply care for this person. It is heart wrenching to read about McCandless's final days in the Alaskan wilderness, holed up in an abandoned school bus with his copy of Tolstoy by his side as he slowly starves to death. By this point I could no longer be frustrated with all of McCandless's mistakes and shortcomings. Rather, I was left with a profound sense of loss for a gifted and troubled soul, who with a little bit of luck, could have make it back to the human society he so needed to escape. The tragic irony is that McCandless seemed to have wanted to make that return journey, but the natural wild he had so embraced would not let him go.     In the end this story's power lies in its ability to force each of us to reflect upon the paths we have taken in life. While McCandless was his own person and surely belied easy pop psychology labels, his tragic death and the nuanced story Krakauer tells makes one pause and take stock of the choices each of us have made in our life.

0060794410|5.0|It was recommended that I read this book at my company and although I'm a support staff member, I found it absolutely incredible and very informative. I was extremely impressed with the amount of research involved and couldn't believe as I was listening and reading how much information was involved in putting this together.  Jim Collins and his team did an excellent job.    This book gave me incredible insight as to why some companies are good and others are great and there are only a handful of companies who meet the criteria to be considered great.  It's also not for the reasons you might think either.    I would recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely interested in the business world.  You will be amazed at what you will read and have a tremendous respect for some of these companies and how their continued hard work and foresight keeps them always competitive and a cut above all the others.  Getting the unabridged CD version as I did is a real treat because it's actually read by the author Jim Collins.

1582701709|4.0|There is a secret about The Secret...and that is this:<br />Everything between the front and back cover is NOT a secret.<br /><br />For people nervous about reading it because you think it's some hyped-up mind control thing, rest easy. You're half right. The book WAS hyped up. Good marketing on their part. As an author, I know  it's important to find a hook or edge. Media, including the internet, gave The Secret all of its hype. The title alone was genius!<br /><br />But when it comes down to it, the book is based on fact and experiences. I always heard \\"to be the best you've got to learn from the best\\". Like any profession, you learn from those who have done it or are doing it...not from Joe Schmoe off the street. You wouldn't go to an accountant to become a hairstylist. Right?<br /><br />The Secret is a recounting of stories or words of wisdom from professionals in various fields who believe that if you want something badly enough--and WORK towards getting it--you can achieve it. We often tell our children this. That's why we send them to college or university. Athletes are told this. That's why they win. Political leaders, singers, artists, writers, anyone who has a dream of being or having more has to focus on what they want to get it. And I'm not talking just material things.<br /><br />I bought The Secret for my teenage daughter. I wanted her to start thinking more positive thoughts, because we all know how difficult it is to be positive when you're a teen. My mother has the book as well and when we were visiting I flipped through some pages and read bits here and there.<br /><br />There is nothing new in The Secret. For people who practice any form of positive thinking (whether reading self-help books, meditating or going to seminars), you are already following some of the advice within. Reading parts of it, I found myself feeling better, mainly because it was reinforcing what I already knew. That is the purpose of The Secret. You can open it to any page and get a boost of positive energy, motivation or inspiration. The book is written in a non-religious yet respectful tone, allowing for various cultures' differences.<br /><br />I can tell you this from personal experience: I have attended many seminars in Canada and the US in the past 20 years. I have heard much of what's in The Secret said a dozen times in a dozen ways, all by very successful people. The key is that success comes in many forms. Not everyone needs or wants huge financial success. And that's okay. Not everyone wants to be president of a huge corporation, and that's fine too. You define your success, then go after it.<br /><br />I have naturally followed so many principles found in The Secret, especially in the past 4 years. I believe I'm proof that these principles work. I've been saying \\"I'm a magnet\\" for 5 years! I've been focused on success, on getting published, on movie deals with my books and so much more. And these things have come. The laws of attraction--belief is key. When you believe and can envision something, you are more than halfway there.<br /><br />My best piece of advice: forget the hype, forget any pre-conceived ideas that The Secret is some demonic, anti-religious, mind controlling entity. It's a BOOK. Pure and simple. It's a book with compiled quotes from successful, influential people who think very positive thoughts. And for those who want to have that kind of success, read The Secret--just flip it open to any page and read. At the very least, you'll have something positive to think about that day. And can't we all use a bit more of that?<br /><br />~ Cheryl Kaye Tardif<br />Author of Divine Interventionor inspiration.

1400044162|5.0|This is a recent winner of the Orange Prize, and deservedly so. Adichie's wonderful narrative skills are showcased in this book, in which she relates the post-colonial horrors in Nigeria, which, like most African nations, is comprised of many different regions, which co-exist within artificial boundaries drawn by the European powers that formerly controlled the area. In drawing these boundaries, little concern was shown for the historic African boundaries or population groups. This book, like \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" and \\"The Darling\\", made me so angry at the countries which colonized and converted African countries and then left them in total chaos, no longer able to function on their own, an entire continent fractured and dependent. Before colonization, Africa's tribal culture and systems worked for its peoples, but the white man destroyed these. Perhaps the Africans did not live the way Westerners want to live, but who are we to say that their way was wrong?<br /><br />In 1967, Nigeria's Igbo people, living in the eastern part of the country, seceded and formed the independent republic of Biafra, thus touching off a three-year civil and ethnic war of such horror, barbarism, and mass starvation that can hardly be imagined. We see a people totally unprepared for the ravages of war: cut off from the rest of the world, babies dying, unable to get the barest necessities of life. The reader is struck by the naivet&eacute; of the Biafrans who believed that they could actually win against the Nigerian forces. One reviewer bluntly said that Biafra was another child of war, dead at birth. By early 1970, starved into submission, the Republic of Biafra ceased to exist.<br /><br />Rather than a story of the war, Adichie tells a story through the minds and experiences of several well-developed characters as she explores the ethnic prejudices of the Africans and the religious differences of Muslims versus Christians in Nigeria as its social fabric was torn apart. The presence of oil in the eastern part of the country made it unthinkable that one ethnic group could control it. Oil and religious differences....hmmmm, does that sound familiar?<br /><br />The stories of affluent twin sisters, their families, friends, and servants are seamlessly woven together as they struggle to survive the atrocities and brutality of war and starvation yet try to keep their dream alive.  It is a story of war, love, ideals, compromise, loyalty, betrayal, and the culture of Africa.<br /><br />This novel immediately captivated me and would not let me go....it was enlightening and educational, meticulously researched, powerful and complex.

B00004Y6O9|3.0|No sane person can look you in the eye and say that they truly admire and respect Van Halen. But the talent is certainly there, no more so than \\"guitar god\\" Eddie Van Halen, who while not as legendary as the Hendrixes and Becks and Pages, certainly deserves credit (and a bit of scorn) for his influential guitar prowess that inevitably led to a swamp of garbage in the next decade (though to be fair, the music on 1984 is probably even more guilty of that crime).     The hits here are all at least listenable (and \\"Runnin' With the Devil\\" is still their best song), and even the energetic cover of \\"You Really Got Me\\" is pretty good even while the candle falls far short of the Kinks' original.     Time has not been kind to this record, though (at the time of its release, I bet it was actually fresh and often amazing), but there's enough stuff that holds up well enough on here to give it a solid recommendation. Roth's goofy effect was already evident: the \\"shooby-doo-wah\\" break in \\"I'm the One\\" and the cover of \\"Ice Cream Man\\" proves two things: they have a sense of humor and they can find themselves on the wrong side of the thin line between clever and stupid. And shouldn't Eddie have revealed his finger-tapping method on a song that's not such a throwaway as \\"Eruption?\\"    Best cuts: \\"Runnin' With the Devil,\\" \\"Jamie's Cryin',\\" \\"On Fire,\\" \\"You Really Got Me,\\" \\"Atomic Punk,\\" \\"Ain't Talkin' `Bout Love,\\" \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\"
B00007BH5C|5.0|Yes, this review is five years late, but there's so much depth to the Lord of the Rings movies, they remain a prime source of entertainment. I have always loved movie soundtracks, and recently acquired all three LOTR theatrical soundtrack CDs, which brings me to \\"Gollum's Song\\", the last track on the Two Towers CD.    I never paid much attention to the movies ending credit music until I got the Two Towers CD, which allowed me to really hear Gollum's Song for the first time. What a unique and haunting piece of music. It perfectly bridges Gollum's tragic history and future, and is a metaphor for all who make terrible unreversable choices in their lives.    Fran Walsh wrote the bleak yet Tolkienesque lyrics, which were then scored in a sublime Howard Shore LOTR theme. But no words can aptly describe Emiliana Torinni's vocals. Her fearless interpretation of Gollum's descent into despair blows away the other two LOTR movie-ending songs. If Emiliana never finds material this good again, she can always be proud of this one searing performance, and we can be grateful for the world-class talents that came together in its creation.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This, one of the finest achievements in scientific, human, and filmmaking history, dazzles the eyes and produces an in-depth look into every single organism's life on this rock we call home.<br /><br />It's a great guide for would-be biologists, cinematographers, and animal lovers. The entire span of birth, death, migration, hunger, family, and survival are shown in great detail. Mostly, insight as to what we as a species can do for the greater good of our planet is presented. It's only a matter of when and how we'll do it.<br /><br />See it with the one and only David Attenborough as the narrator. He tells it with such matter-of-fact precision and deep love for the subject. No one else will do.

Close on its heels, though, is Comes A Time.  Brilliant and thoughtful songs that establish a mood and a place, except for the odd \\"Motorcycle Mama\\" which is best omitted.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|This is, by far, the best picture quality I have ever seen in HD. I have a half-dozen HD-DVDs and this one is clearly the best looking. Now I know why Microsoft packed this title in with the Xbox360 add-on drive. If you want to see what your HDTV can really do, check out this movie on HD-DVD. All I could say throughout watching this was \\"wow!\\". Every shot is ultra-sharp, no compression artifacts at all. Great colors, especially on the sky shots. Basically some of the most amazing footage I've ever seen.<br /><br />I've never seen the movie before (not even the original) and I totally loved it. The whole production is top-notch. I didn't find it to be long at all. Jackson took as long as was necessary to tell the story properly. In fact, more movies should be 3 hours long. Despite what other people are saying about the CG effects, it is really only even barely noticeable on the stampede scene. Most people don't even realize how much special effects are used in the movie. Do you think King Kong is a man in a suit? Do you think Peter Jackson traveled back in time to film on location in new york city? Pretty much the whole movie is using some 3d graphics and green screen work. And it looks absolutely fabulous in HD.<br /><br />Bottomline, this is an excellent showcase for HD-DVD. It is worth picking up just to see how good an HD-DVD can be on your HDTV. Highly recommended.

B000BKJ6WW|5.0|When an album is on Billboard's music chart for a record breaking 741 weeks, you have to know what went on behind the scenes.  This remarkable DVD explains in acute detail through interviews with all the band members, how they got the sounds they did.  David Gilmour provides insight into how he obtained certain echoes and sound duplication of his guitar on several tracks, while Roger Waters talks about the meaning behind his lyrics and why they seem to appeal to so many people.  When pieces of the albums are singles out on the equalizer, you can  hear just how many layers of music and special effects went into the making of this landmark album.  Find out from Waters how simple and clever it was to get those sound effects for \\"Money\\".  Richard Wright's piano solos are especially beautiful, even without the rest of the band.  He is truly under-rated.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|As enough people have pointed out already, this movie is painfully pointless. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot but I feel the end ruined the movie. The plot keeps you interested to get to the end. There's plenty of female nudity and blood for all the guys out there. I prefer a movie with some kind of depth to it, not pointless slaughter.
B000MGUZM0|1.0|I agree with the previous review that \\"No Cars Go\\", \\"Intervention\\", and MAYBE \\"Keep the Car Running\\" are the best songs on the album, but that is not saying much.  The rest of the songs just drone on into oblivion.  \\"Subtle\\" is certainly the word for the opener, \\"Black Mirror\\".  It sets the tone for the entire album.  Listening to Butler whine \\"Blaaack Mirrooor\\" and \\"I don't wanna do _____ no more\\" for 3 songs is not inspirational in the least.  Where are the danceable, 50's diner style rhythms of \\"Funeral\\"?  Why are the intricate string arrangements barely audible?  The straight, endless 4/4 beats of this recording and buried strings are unacceptable, no matter how much they \\"planned it.\\"<br /><br />The more I listen to this album, the more I realize how good the Arcade Fire's first album was.  I love Funeral, but it was the death of this band.  And yes, that makes me want to cry.  \\"I don't wanna listen to Arcade Fire no more.\\"

It surprised me at almost every turn and I've become a real fan.
0743496728|4.0|I was a little afraid to read this book because I am a teacher at a large high school.  But, in the end, I'm glad I read it.  For those of you that afraid of the violence of the act in the book, you need not worry.  The book doesn't focus on the actual school shooting very much, but focuses more on the aftermath and the effect it has on the town and its residents.  The book basically focuses on a small number of people that were directly affected by the shootings and how their pasts helped cause the shooting itself.  First, there is Josie, one of the survivors of the shootings.  She is by far one of the most interesting characters in the book.  Then there is Alex, Josie's mother and the county judge that was assigned to the case.  Her struggle to reach out to her daughter is heartbreaking.  Then, there is Lacey, the shooter's mother who is also a midwife.  Her story is devastating, filled with guilt and regret that you will actually cry when you read parts of her story.  Last, and definitely not least, there is Peter, the young boy who was tortured throughout his life by the popular kids and then finally snapped one day.    This book was really a story about relationships and how everything you do affects someone more deeply than you realize.  It's a book that will fill you with many emotions: anger, grief, hate, but above all this, a glint of hope in the end.  I definitely recommend this book to any parent, teacher, and student.  It was definitely an eye-opener for me.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|I was not prepared for what I found on this album. \\"What I've Done\\" was a good tune, and I was hoping for much more along the same lines as that and previous hits. To me, while this is not a terrible album, it was just such a departure from their previous albums that I just can't get into it. It doesn't rock hard. The sound production sounds great, but the tunes are mostly mellowed out and sound made for pop radio. I may still listen to this on occasion, but for me, this just didn't cut it. Maybe it will grow on me over time. But I doubt it. The new Finger Eleven cd gave me the same feeling. The lead-off single was really a good song, and the rest of the cd is watered down, practically acoustic stuff, which has it's place, but come on! Are they purposely trying to alienate certain fans? It seems like it to me.Oh well, they were never one of my favs anyway.

B000O178BY|4.0|This is the best NIN since The Downward Spiral. The dark, in your face themes of TDS are not evident any more, but this cd has lots of variety in song types. Some are more like metal, others are heavy with synth beats and are groove-driven, still others showcase the softer side of Trent Reznor. All in all, this was what I was looking for from NIN for quite some time. I'm glad that the next one should be out sometime next year too. 4.5/5 stars.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I am about ten years from retirement to give you an idea of my age. And yet I enjoy many of the new horror movies if they have something besides all head banging music and tons of gore. This movie will rock your world no matter what age you are. Many adaptations of games do not make it in my replayable list. This one excels there. This is one you will find yourself regularly popping in the player for a revisit of the haunting music, great acting, and scary as hell zombies and other creatures. This is by far one of my favorite horror movies. Well thought out screenplay, excellent directing, and super music score. I give it a high recommendation. I haven't owned a console game since the first Nintendo, but this movie has tempted me to buy a new one even though I prefer the PC versions. By the way I did not care for the last Final Fantasy movie, but I'm sure game console gamers may. This movie although possibly not as appreciated by those with game consoles, will definitely be appreciated by Horror/SciFi movie fans. I recommend the sequel as well. Although not quite as scary, still quite good in the action department.
0812975219|3.0|Taleb, a New York City trader, has much to say about the stock market, traders, CEO's and business \\"success.\\"  Much of it isn't very flattering, which understandably is off-putting to some.  Yes, Taleb demonstrates a high opinion of himself and can be trite.  (Actually, he devotes a section to plattitudes and \\"business speak\\" that was quite witty.)  Don't let this get in the way of the important points he has to make.<br /><br />Taleb points out that what what we understand as market \\"success\\" has more to do with sheer randomness and less to do with the abilities and talents of a trader than we think.  This point is taken further by arguing that the profession of stock trading is more prone to rewarding random (\\"lucky\\" if you will) success than other professions (such as cooking or being a concert pianist, for example.)  Much of the book revolves around illlustrating this point.<br /><br />Taleb goes beyond merely explaining the randomness in securities trading (frequently using his colleagues to prove his point about statisitcal probability and success) - he also writes about epistomology (the \\"philosophy of thought\\") and by extension, biology and psychology.  For me, this was the most rewarding part of the book.  Essentially, he argues, humans are not \\"hard wired\\" for random events.  We seek to make sense out of chaos (what he refers to as \\"noise\\").  We act irrationally, even when all evidence points to a rational reaction, because we are slaves to our emotions.  These tendencies - looking for patterns when there are none and actiing on emotion - explain why we make many of the investment decisions we make.<br /><br />\\"The solution\\" he writes, \\"does not reside in taming my heart.\\"  Instead - and surprisingly - Taleb cites Zeno, a  4th century BCE philosopher best known for his philosophy of \\"stoicism\\": an attempt to be immune from life's ups and downs, generous in victory and accepting of defeat.  This solution rang hollow with me.  I was much more impressed with his example of Nero Tulip - a successful trader whose goal was \\"longevity\\" in the business rather than to get rich quickly as many of his colleagues seem to want to do.<br /><br />I can't give the book more than three stars - the arrogance of the author grew thin as did his thinly veiled contempt for other traders.  The relationship between statistics and trading was interesting, but a dry for my taste.  His philosophical conclusions - particularly on Wittgenstein and Zeno - were worthy life advice, but misapplied in a business context.  Recommended for those actively involved in the profession.lip - a successful trader whose goal was \\"longevity\\" in the business rather than to get rich quickly as many of his colleagues seem to want to do.

0767834739|4.0|This is a great sequel to the original. Although it didn't seem as dark and scary as the first, it made up for it in action. The movie picks up where the first one left off. As our heroine has escaped the hospital she finds a devastated world. She must find her only surviving friend and do what she can to bring the Umbrella Corporation down. She finds out more horrible truths about them and is assisted by a unlikely allie. Both movies complement each other nicely. I definitely recommend you add this to your Horror/SciFi collection. A must for anyone that owns \\"Resident Evil\\". I am looking forward to the third movie in this set.
B000I2MRHE|3.0|This toy is a good idea, sort of. My daughter loved, and still plays with, the matt itself. But as a GERD baby (throws up a lot) the spin toy didnt meet her approval. For one, it was a bit hard to lay on. Also, the curved bug - although cute - was either too long when she was at the target age for learning what its designed for, or too small for her body once she got long enough to fit. *She is 6 months old and 17lbs now*. I would put her in it every day, and she would scream until she would vomit. More, the bug's antanee would get in her eyes. Once she got used to it, she still didnt find it very entertaining.     On the whole, I think its a good idea that needed more work. Its cute, the matt is still very useful, but the spinner in our house just sits in the corner, or holds toys. Maybe it will come in handy later but for now its not being used for what it was intended.     As always, your results may vary - but if your child doesnt like laying on their face, this toy may not help that in my opinion.

B00005JPRV|4.0|Andre is a shallow little man, in way too deep with the big boys. He finally reached the end of his line of petty scams and failed \\"sure things.\\" Suicide seems like the only way out - if nothing else, it will annoy the thugs who would have killed him anyway. He's about to jump (from a nonlethal looking bridge) when he sees a beautiful woman about to do the same. She does jump, then follows her into the river to save her.<br /><br />One old idea says that when you save someone's life, you become responsible for that life. In that vein, the woman (Angela) places her gorgeous self in his small and unwashed hands. From that point on, it looks like a classic feel-good movie trying crawl out from under[[ASIN:0800195175 The Fifth Element]]. Despite dark moments, rough edges, and his best efforts, she turns Andre's life around.<br /><br />It's not a high-speed effects-fest, like other of Besson's movies. In fact, Besson might use the black and white filming as a Luddite statement that plot and acting really make the movie, not the technology. (True, but shifts between sepia and blue-green color casts became annoying.) This could be a good date movie, if she doesn't want things blowing up and he doesn't want a chick flick. It's enjoyable, but most memorable for Angela's (Rie Rasmussen's) lean, leggy looks and micro-miniskirt.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
1594489505|5.0|When I began reading this, I told some friends it was good, but not as good a read as \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  I take back every word I said.  It IS a slower read than \\"The Kite Runner\\" but I was mistaken - it is every bit as moving - perhaps more so, than Hosseini's first novel. Its slower pace allows, nay, DEMANDS that a solemn thoughtfulness that is rare in any novel.      I, only half jokingly, referred to \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" as \\"a woman's book.\\"  And it is.  And I mean that only in the very best way.    Though written by a man, it is a tale of hardship, a tale of two vastly different women of different ages, of different lives, who out of necessity form a bond, an unlikely alliance and ultimately a friendship and a life that was initially, for me a western man, nearly impossible to wrap his mind around.     At the center of the story is Mariam, a \\"harami\\" - the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy man and a troubled young woman, one of his housekeepers.  We watch her grow, only to see every hope and dream dashed in a culture that treats women as a cross between chattel and working animals.  Yet, throughout this tale of this most cheerless and longsuffering of existences, we get to hear the beating of Mariam's immense heart.      Hosseini's prose throughout the narrative feels sometimes bare, dry . . . stoic.  Then, without warning, the dramatic - heart stopping events come alive in prose that dazzles and explodes as it etches its images into the brain.      The final 50 or so pages were literally impossible to put down - or to read without my tears staining every page.      It was a story difficult to read without finding that my emotions were overwhelming my reason.  At times I found myself so angry, enraged even, full of hatred at how horribly, how shabbily we humans can treat each other, at the closed-mindedness we allow ourselves to rule our lives with, how blindly we follow and helplessly, fearfully endure abuse and mistreatment.     It's also a story to cherish, a story that shows the strength and ultimate triumph of the human spirit and the power to forgive and go on.  A story of hoping against hopelessness, of enduring beyond what we think we cannot and ultimately of the very beauty and value of our lives.  It is, mark my words, a story to be remembered and cherished.    p.

B000PTYP5C|3.0|A solid effort from DT this time around, and it's wonderful to see the support of a good record label behind them. Definitely worth getting the special edition for the documentary and packaging. The music...well, as with every album since SDOIT it's a mixed bag. Despite Portnoy's insistence that this would be a heavy, modern, ballsy album, it simply isn't.<br /><br />ToT was a determined move in those directions, competing with the likes of Disturbed and Tool while maintaining the classic DT prog sound. On this disc however, The first four songs are heavy and aggressive, but not any more so than an your average track from Awake or ToT (though much more aggressive than anything on Octavarium). The album slows WAY down about mid-way through with 'Repentance', 'Prophets of Doom' (a bizzare metal/techno song??), and 'Ministry of Lost Souls.' This triple punch of slower/mellow tunes really lets the air out of the whole experience and ultimately prevents it from living up to Portnoy's promises. Don't get me wrong, they aren't bad songs, but they simply aren't as strong as they should be in light of the earlier tunes (Constant Motion and Dark Eternal Night in particular), and they seem to bog the whole album down a bit.<br /><br />It's also hard to imagine most DT fans not taking issue with some of the lyrics on this album. DT has been long known for introspective, well-crafted, mature themes. I'm not sure if DT is trying to fit in with some of their new label mates, or simply got lazy, but some of the lyrics (especially on the sprawling 'In the Presence of Enemies) are plain bad if not embarrassing. Petrucci has stated that he wrote a lot of fictional lyrics for this disc, but I thought he meant something along the lines of 'Pull Me Under' or 'Metropolis'. Apparently he meant '1982 Iron Maiden B-sides'. Constant references to the 'Dark Master', vampires, ancient pharoahs are awkward and seem juvenille for a band that delivered such stunning works as the 'Scenes from a Memory' concept album, and songs such as 'Sacrificed Sons' or 'Take Away My Pain'. The usually sobering vocals of LaBrie are almost comical as he sings \\"Dark Master - I will not serve youuuuuahhh!!!\\" Cringe-worthy to say the least. It reminded me of an SNL skit where Hetfield and Dickenson duel it out for the sake of melodrama. Not sure what was going on here. I'm all for something new and different, but the lyrics are just bad. No offense to Petrucci (one of my favorite lyricists), but it just doesn't work in the context of DT.<br /><br />Overall I can't complain much. DT's worst effort is still better than most swill on the market today, but they've delivered so brilliantly in the past that it seems impossible for them to improve. I'll enjoy this one just as much as the others and anticipate what they do next.bum, and songs such as 'Sacrificed Sons' or 'Take Away My Pain'.

0525457585|5.0|If you've never seen the movie version of \\"The Neverending Story,\\" then read the book first. If you have seen one of the movies, then read the book as soon as possible, since neither of the movies do the book justice.    The story starts out with young Bastian Balthasar Bux going into a bookstore and stealing a book entitled \\"The Neverending Story.\\" For reasons he can't explain, Bastian felt that he had to have the book. Shutting himself up in the school attic, he reads about Atreyu, the chosen messenger to find a cure for the Childlike Empress and prevent The Nothing from destroying Fantastica. Atreyu discovers that the Childlike Empress needs a new name, and that only someone from the human world, the savior, can give her one. The savior turns out to be none other than Bastian himself! He thinks of a new name for her once he reads about her, but he must say her name out loud for Fantastica to be saved. Fearing what the Childlike Empress will think of him once she sees him, Bastian holds off saying the name aloud. Eventually, when Fantastica's destruction is imminent, Bastian says her new name out loud, and he is drawn into Fantastica, and transformed into a handsome, heroic-looking figure. The Childlike Empress tells Bastian that whatever he wishes for will come true, until he finds out what he truly wants. Unfortunately, he soon finds out that for every wish, he loses a memory of his life in the human world. I will leave off at this point, except to point out that Bastian journeys in his wishes from self-centeredness to self-giving.    \\"The Neverending Story\\" is a multi-layered work that people of all ages can enjoy. In addition to being a wonderfully readable fantasy/adventure story, it is rich in philosophy and symbolism. For example, The Nothing that is slowly destroying Fantastica could be symbolic of people losing their capacity for imagination and creativity. In addition, Bastian's quest to find out what he really wants is immensely rich in its philosophical implications, not to mention Campbell-ite hero quest overtones. Hopefully a movie will be re-made (possible as a mini-series) that will follow the book more closely and do this great work justice.

As a collector of Blackmore's music for infinite numbers of years the true Rainbow is with Ronnie James Dio at the microphone.<br /><br />This performance from Munich 1977 will be a terrific representation of the Dio period as long as you can understand the video quality is not 2007 state of the art.  There are imperfections.<br /><br />For those that aren't familiar with Ritchie Blackmore's song arrangements there are going to be solos and improvisational pieces in sections that you may think become self-indulgent but enjoy what he does and not worry when it is!<br /><br />The opening track \\"Kill The King\\" is a blowtorch.  The energy level is superlative and it is hard to imagine anyone singing the lyrics but Dio.<br /><br />For us old rockers that wished for some Deep Purple tunes, we did get a fine version of \\"Mistreated.\\"<br /><br />The critics of Blackmore were hushed when they witnessed the diversity of  \\"Sixteenth Century Greensleeves\\" and \\"Catch the Rainbow.\\" Ritchie's guitar created images of mystique and beauty.

B000QFAJ7S|3.0|When I heard \\"Never Again,\\" the new single from Kelly Clarkson, I was really excited about hearing the new cd. Then I heard that it had an edgier rock sound and that just made it even better. But when I got the cd, I was disappointed. \\"Never Again\\" is a great song, but after that, it just goes downhill. It's a lot of pop trying to be rock. If you like Avril Lavigne, then you'll probably like this cd. But if you like actual rock, it will most likely come off as mediocre and trying too hard to be something it's not. \\"Breakaway\\" was an awesome cd and this one just doesn't live up to its predecessor.

630514415X|3.0|\\"He Got Game\\" is another solid outing for director Spike Lee. He paints a realistic picture of life for a inner city basketball phenom and its many demands and pressures. Ray Allen isn't as proficient an actor as he is a shooting guard, yet his performance works here. Denzel Washington and a supporting cast of Lee film veterans deliver in their roles, making up for any inexperience Allen has. Washington is impressive as Allen's father, a convicted felon who is given a short work release to try to convince his star son to attend the governeor's alma mater. Revisiting this film about 9 years after its release, I still feel entertained and connected with the main characters. I feel it stands as a triumph for Lee and a good tale of basketball, exploitation, wounded family relations, and redemption (in a way).

0783225849|5.0|By far Hitchcock's most twisted film, psycho twists plot, twists characters, and twists gender as no film ever had done.. Hitchcock was probably the best director at making technical breakthroughs and also in making those breakthroughs enjoyable for the audiece without any threads showing.. This is especially evident in psycho.. but also in other films like Vertigo with its famous vertigo camera effect that would later be copyed by several directors..<br />Psycho was a great success for Hitchcock and perhaps his last absolute masterpiece (though i would argue that the birds and Marnie were truly great masterpieces - and two of my favorites..) Anthony Perkins was truly made to play Norman bates.. although his career suffered afterwards as he would always be remembered as norman bates and he couldn't get the casting he deserved..<br />interestingly Hitchcock was extremely popular with the french new wave directors.. and psycho was kind of their bible in film - how to break the rules in effective ways..

B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Ros' 2002 album has no real name, and all the songs are also untitled. There are no actual lyrics, all the vocals are in a nonexistent language. The booklet consists of several blank pages the band encourages listeners to write their thoughts in. Taken altogether, ( ) can seem kind of pretentious. It doesn't really matter though, it's about the music and it's pretty great.    ( ) has two distinct parts, a light first half and a more intense second half. The first half is all about atmosphere. There's a lot of piano, especially in the third track which has a nice plunking tune, while the rest of it is more ambient pleasantness. They use distorted guitar to create texture instead of melody, and it's very dissimilar from the music you're probably used to hearing. It's best to not try and listen to it in quick bursts, and instead have it on when you're doing something else or just relaxing.    Where I think the album gets really interesting is the second half. It focuses on the build and release of tension, and with the time they take to get where they're going they can really create immensely enjoyable moments throughout. It takes them quite a while to get to the point, but once they get there it can be a transcendent listening experience. Some of it sounds like Radiohead at their spaciest, but Thom Yorke and company rarely get as climactic. The various songs can seem sort of similar in the way they work up to the big moments, but it doesn't make it less interesting or powerful. After the seventh track it seems like it's winding down, but before the final song ends it breaks into the hardest guitar you'll find on the record in a very satisfying conclusion.    The use of drums is much more important in the second half, as they set the intensity level almost by themselves, along with how passionate the vocalist sounds. Back to him, he's pretty good but I have a bit of an issue. Just because he's singing in a fake language doesn't mean it can't get repetitive. He sings what sounds phonetically like \\"You sigh on\\" or some close variation nearly constantly throughout the whole thing, and it can get irritating if you pay too much attention to him. It is this minor annoyance plus the very long amount of time it takes to get to the really good moments that keep the album from being truly excellent, in my mind. One could argue that the buildup makes the eventual payoff even sweeter, but I think it's still an imperfect way to make music.

0385522401|5.0|Before he reaches the first full stop in his latest novel, British novelist Ian McEwan opens everything readers must know about his main characters in \\"On Chesil Beach\\". They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible.\\"<br /><br />The young couple is Edward and Florence, both are 22, and having dinner in their hotel room on the Corset Coast. The mood is tense between them, although they seem to be happy. The inexperience is the cause of so much embarrassment. The writer compares the sexual act to a journey in which the boy is afraid of arriving too soon, and the girl is afraid of the whole trip itself.<br /><br />Some writers become darker and heavy with time. Throughout his career, McEwan became softer and softer, more sophisticated. In the past few years he seems to believe in the possibility of happiness for his characters - specially in \\"Atonement\\" and \\"Saturday\\" - but there is a long road before they reach it.<br /><br />McEwan's characters always seem to be trying to set scores with the past. But they are frustrated and realize that the past can't be changed. For the writer, small gestures can be devastating, may save lives, avoid suffering. But when people realize it, it is too late.<br /><br />\\"On the Beach\\" is sort of a prose version of Phillip Larkin's famous poem `Annus Mirabilis'. If only Edward and Florence could know how the late 60s would be different. Maybe their first night of love wouldn't be so complicated, but it wouldn't also have resulted in such a fine novel

B000002N9L|5.0|It wasn't long after Prince exited Warner Bros,changed his name to<br />O(-> and released [[ASIN:B000002N1E The Gold Experience]] did he begin to collect some of his \\"private music vault\\" for this album in 1996.Considering how well the same idea worked 15 years earlier with [[ASIN:B000002KLP Dirty Mind]] he didn't see how it wouldn't work on 'Chaos And Disorder' and musically it did. Both albums have the one similarity of being Prince's more rock oriented music. Prince's style on the rock guitar is showcased throughout the uptempo songs on this album.The title track,\\"I Like It There\\",\\"Into The Light\\" and \\"I Will\\" are extrodinary rockers.For those who enjoy more pop/rock the easy going \\"Dinner With Delores\\",with it's 70's soft rock feel will fit the bill nicely and it is actually one of his best songs of the period. The loud blues rock of \\"Zannalee\\" is not exactly typical of Prince but it challanges him as a musician.Don't think that just because this is often hyped as Prince \\"rock\\" album (which in many ways it is) Prince is his always eclectic self on the zesty funk-rock hybrids of \\"Right The Wrong\\",\\"I Rock Therefore I Am\\" and \\"Dig You Better Dead\\"-all three of which are also some of his strongest songs.'Chaos And Disorder' is Prince's final \\"official\\" Warner Bros. album and presents some his most direct songs;most of these tunes are less then 3 and 4 minutes and have a very refreshing directness.One thing that anyone considering purchasing this should know is this was released during a very trying time for Prince-he was fighting with Warners,had the \\"SLAVE\\" tattoo on his face and the lyrics here are filled with a lot of bitterness and edginess.As with many of Prince's mid 1990's music it will certainly get your attention.But even I found myself revisiting it after all these years of thinking of this as one of Prince's weakest albums and maybe more people should do that.

B000ICL3KG|2.0|How one feels about this film is likely going to depend on your views on Global Warming Theory. It's a film that's designed to preach to the choir on the dangers of Global Warming, but it doesn't do so in the best way.    The movie is entertaining. Al Gore, who I would've voted for in 2000 had I been allowed to do so, is a very engaging speaker, and I loved the clip from \\"Futurama\\" that was used in the movie.    But there were some problems I had. The most notable was a shot of Gore standing front of a graph that, I think, was supposed to illustrate the increase in global tempratures. The thing is, there were no lables on the graph, and it was therefore meaningless.    The movie also failed to answer some basic questions I have had about Global Warming Theory. Things like why temps seemed higher in the late 1930's and early 1940's, how many of our temprature records are skewed by Urban Heat Islands and the end of the Little Ice Age, whether or not an increase in global tempratures might actually have a net positive benefit to humanity as a whole (longer growing seasons in Siberia and Canada, for example), why we think the climate is PERFECT and should stay this way NO MATTER WHAT, and, most importantly, how can we possibly make accurate predictions on what the climate might be like 10, 20, 50, 100 years hence, when we couldn't even accurately guess what the 2006 Atlantic Hurricane Season was going to be like?    No, this film didn't answer, or even really ask, any of these questions, and that's a problem for me. On the other hand, it was a fairy entertaining movie, and I've certainly seen propaganda films that were less entertaining (and have no doubts, this IS a propaganda film. It's designed to push a certain point of view. There's not anything neccessarily WRONG with that, but you need to keep it in mind when seeing it).    As a final word, let me say that while I do remain very skeptical of Global Warming Theory, I also think it doesn't matter. Not even slightly. I think stomping out pollution is a worthwhile goal in of itself. I think the point of cleaning up our air and water should be to have clean air and water. Ultimately if we can accomplish that, then what else matters?
817224164X|3.0|This is a great historical book to read. It definitely lets the reader into the mind of Adolf Hitler and his life prior to when he became the Hitler we all know. After reading this, it is suprising anyone allowed him to get so powerful (remember, he became dictator legally in Germany). This is a LONG and dense book filled with hate but it's a book that must be read if one wants to understand the Holocaust, Adolf Hitler, and World War II. Any historian should definitely read this, as well as history buffs.

0553296981|5.0|As a budding historian, I love this memoir. It gives a unique perspective into what it was like to be a young Jewish girl during the Holocaust. It is an amazing story, written by a couragous girl and it can really open people's minds up to the whole story. It is definitely one of those books that you just have to read in your lifetime. The unedited version is great as well as the previous versions.
068983571X|5.0|Some proclaim Doyle's greatest work to be \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\\" And, it may be just that.<br /><br />Set on a British estate, mixing science fictional accounts with old wive's tales and mythology, it is not a standard tale of urban sleuthing.  This involves Holmes outside of London, and working with the \\"plebians\\" or \\"ordinary people\\" in his mission to save \\"Sir Henry\\" from encountering the same fate as his uncle Sir Charles Baskerville.<br /><br />There are tales of adultery, slanting lies and rendevous at late hours of the  night in the moor which flanks the estate of Sir Henry.  The evenings overlooking the moor are often disturbed by the noisy backdrop of a hound howling, but not the sound of  a hound ever heard by anyone before.<br /><br />The moor is dangerously dotted with mires in which a step could mean one's end.  Muddy and deep, the step into such places becomes a trap for the unwary. Hence, the moor includes dangers beyond its sounds, it is a place where young and old should avoid unless they know which places are safe and which are not.<br /><br />An entomologist named Stapleton knows the moor inside and out.  He befriends Sir Henry and Watson. He cannot meet Sherlock Holmes who must stay in London for other cases. This story follows the day-to-day discoveries of Watson, more than others.<br /><br />In the end, the intertwining of evil that haunts the people in the tiny hamlet becomes staggering and one must wonder - could a village of such small size really have so many people within it keeping such deadly secrets without one of the others (if not all of the others) knowing? Probably not.  But, who cares.<br /><br />And, I lastly note that Doyle certainly was more than a mystery writer. His prose rivals Forster or Waugh. For instance, he wrote:\\"We looked back on it now;  the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams into threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands.. . Now and then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm.\\"<br /><br />With prose like that, you only conclude: This is more than a mystery novel.roofed with stone, with no creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm.\\"       With prose like that, you only conclude: This is more than a mystery novel.
0440237688|5.0|One of the most amazing books I've ever read. I read it when I was in fourth grade and I have remembered the book ever since. It's a great read for many ages and it makes the reader think about what life would be like with no emotional connections or anything like that.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|My family and I went to see this at the show when it came out, I think it was on the 4th of July, and we loved it then... (Even my wife who HATES sci-fi) we dust it off once or twice a year and watch it again and again. We got it on VHS and then DVD when that wore out. This edition has a few different scenes than the original which I did rather like (specifically, the ones concerning the drunken crop duster, making him much more of a sympathetic character).<br /><br />Bill Pullman's speech to rev up the troops is one of my favorite from any movie. I think that the overwhelming amount of the negative reviews of this great movie come from self hating Americans, who can't accept that America is the one who always has to step up to the plate.<br /><br />If you don't own this DVD you should.
1400079179|5.0|This is a great book and I recommend it for anyone. It is fiction but the other does do some through research and the background is mainly correct. It's a great book that can get people talking about Mary Mag. and the whole debate, which I think should be the point of most books out there anyway (to get people talking about an issue). It's controversial, which makes it even that much more interesting and if you understand the book is fiction, there is no way anyone can take offense to it.

0743464117|5.0|This is a great book. Stephen E. Ambrose was a great historian who recently passed away. This is his time period and this is one of the best World War II books I have ever read. It was eventually adapted into an HBO miniseries so if you don't want to read the book, watch the miniseries because the miniseries sticks very close to the book. The book is not that long, nor is it that dense but the reader comes to know and love the 101st Airborne Easy company. Those men were so brave and did so much for our country and that shows through this book.

0451191153|5.0|Seriously this is one of my top 5 books I have ever read. This author not only learned english, but came up with her own philosophy. This book is the beginning of her philosophy, it's not completely ironed out here but in her book that followed this one \\"Atlas Strugged\\", that's where you fully see her completed philosophy (Objectivism). This is a heavy book but it makes you think. The characters are SO well developed that you think you personally knew these people! That's one of Ms. Rand's best qualities as a writer. She develops her characters so well. They have many demensions and layers, which you don't always find in books now adays. This should be a book everyone reads at least once, if not more.
B000PFUAO6|1.0|Basically you can sum up DT's career in 2 phases., pre and post Scenes From a Memory... It seemed like right after Metropolis 2 DT became heavier and heavier and seemed to lose their happiness.. Every album since this has less and less 'pep' and 'bounciness'... yet I keep buying their albums hoping that they will reinvent themselves again... gone are the days of the DT tight guitars (listen to this album compared to LTE 2 and Awake and you will know what I mean), great hooks, and even any recognizable song structure....    I have listened to this album about 4x since I purchased it, and it just doesn't get me feeling as I did way back in the day.. I actually figured it out., somehow it sounds like Lamb of God w/ keyboards and someone that sings...    I'm sorry DT, I had such high hopes.

033041836X|5.0|Oh my god, this is an amazing book. It's  a memoir of Alice Sebold's rape and her how she picked up the pieces of her life after it. It's a great read for rape survivors, friends/family members of rape survivors, and just the general public. Ms. Sebold is brutally honest and give a fully detailed account of what happened, which is difficult to read and I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to write. She is a brave, strong woman and this is a great book. It's heavy and sad at times but it is something that should be read. This book is one of my favorites because it means a great deal to me personally and it is a great addition to the literature out there.
B00005LC1H|4.0|There is indeed nothing faulty with Fawlty Towers.<br />This Britcom which was first filmed in 1975 then added to later in 1979 is an enduring classic of its genre and is definitely one of the all time best....period.<br />It's star John Cleese along with then-wife and co-star(Polly)Connie Booth collaborated on the entire series together.Most of the series was filmed in studio but there were quite a few exterior shots and they used the Wooburn Grange Country Club in Torquay,England for that purpose.The club itself has since burned down and been bulldozed to make way for residential development.<br />However Cleeses' actual inspiration for the character of Basil Fawlty comes from one Mr.Sinclair(now deceased) the o/o of the GlenEagles Hotel in Torquay.It seems Cleese and some of the Monty Python cast and crew were staying at the GlenEagles and experienced some of Mr.Sinclair's,shall we say,\\"inestimable charm\\" first hand.Most of the group was not amused and off most trotted to a nearby and more forgiving establishment for the duration of their stay there.Cleese however was intrigued by the utter gall,bluster and plain rudeness of Mr.Sinclair and thought he would stay to observe this local phenom up close and personal.From that experience sprang forth the idea for Basil Fawlty and the rest is sitcom history.<br />Fawlty Towers has created a minor tourism point of call for the GlenEagles Hotel in Torquay and the surrounding area .Buses and folks from all over the world come there to have a glimpse of the famous hotel which inspried this wonderful show.Depending on who one talks to the oppinions of locals range from happy to embarassed but very rarely negative.And this is quite a testament to just a 12 episode Britcom which during its' first airing in 1975 didn't get much attention at all.It wasn't until its' re-runs the following years that the groundswell gathered steam which eventually prompted more eps to be filmed in 1979.When you look at them today it is almost nigh impossible to tell where the /75-ers start and the /79-ers end.Again another indication of the over all quality of the show from top to bottom.<br />Technically speaking this show has been transferred very well from tape.The contrast and colours have been cleaned up and it looks better than it ever did.<br />The three discs included with this set(not four as indicated above by one of the product reviewers)comes with interviews with Cleese,Sachs(Manuel) and Scales(Mrs.Fawlty),trips to Torquay,out takes,directors commentaries and more.<br />The reason I'm not giving this higher stars is because of the lack of any inserts with episode information.There is an extremely lean blurb for each ep on the back cover of the set but that's it.One assumes also that the eps listed are in order but it would have been nice to have at least release dates but sadly there are none.I think for the price BBC video could have plumped this set up a bit.<br />In conclusion except for the minor drawbacks listed this set generally is worth getting for any fan of good comedy sitcoms and /or Britcoms.It's humour and characters are universally indentifiable and work on many levels.It is still fast paced(in large part due to its' judicious editing) and plain laugh out loud funny.A real \\"inn-keeper\\"!!tell where the /75-ers start and the /79-ers end.Again another indication of the over all quality of the show from top to bottom.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|There is nothing in the world that screams \\"nature documentary\\" than the incomparable voice of David Attenborough. And just as with the scores of other shows that David has done, this one is sure to please. The footage is phenomenal. Not only are the images immaculate in their quality and composition (every single frame in this 5 disc set would make an incredible poster), but you are constantly sitting there asking \\"How in the #$*@ did they get THAT shot? The disc contains behind the scenes footage that shows what the camerapeople went through and some of the incredible equipment that they used. They also go into all of the efforts required (some locations took over 3 years for the crew to obtain permission to film) and this set is well worth the time and labor.    The other thing that is amazing is that growing up with PBS and having the Discovery Channel and TLC and all of the other outlets for nature documentaries that you figure that we would have seen it all by now. But Planet Earth proves that there is still a whole lot that we don't know about this spinning orb of ours. You see creatures and environments that you never imagined existed. The BBC managed to find creatures and places on Earth that still had not been photographed and they are amazing.    Just watch out if you have small children as even the audio can get very intense at times.
0156027321|2.0|Life of Pi packs much too little into much too big of a book.  Despite the claim that the story would make me \\"believe in God,\\" it had very little affect on my relation with the Almighty.  Only that I kept praying that the tiger would put the religiously confused kid out of his misery and get this whole pretentious story over with.      No such luck.     Rather the book has become all the rage with freshman English teachers.  Granted, Yann Martel has a way with words and writes strong descriptions.  But I think the English teachers all want it on their syllabi because it creates the impression that their pre-AP students are reading something symbolic and philosophical.      It's the new Lord of the Flies.  We no longer have to fill young minds with a pessimistic post-World War II tale about how essentially brutal and greedy we all are.  Now we have a new age alternative.    This new farfetched tale of castaway youth contends that we can resolve all the contradictions that are tearing up the real world by uncritically embracing several competing world views at once. Scientific reasoning, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity are actually all one and the same!     Why don't I feel more uplifted by this amazing discovery?
0618871713|5.0|\\"Graphic novels\\" come with a certain amount of baggage--there seems to be a subset of the population who read (or collect and preserve in climate-controlled vaults...) comics and graphic novels, and too often accept style   over novel-like content.  Not so this one!  Bechdel has produced an emotionally intense and unflinchingly honest memoir here, and the artwork perfectly complements rather than overwhelms the narrative.    I hate to see Bechdel ghettoized as a Lesbian artist/writer, because while the [[ASIN:1555838332 Dykes to Watch Out for]] strips were (obviously) gay-themed, they were scorchingly funny and the characters complex enough to appeal to a less-invested audience than just the gay community.  While Fun Home does address Bechdel's father's closeted homo- or bisexuality, and her own coming out to her parents, the book really isn't exclusively a \\"gay\\" memoir.  It's a memoir of a complex set of family relationships and memories of her own young life seen through her adult eyes. And in that regard, it has universal appeal.    At an author's reading, Bechdel went into some detail regarding her illustrations.  She had access to a great many photos of the inside of the family home, and went to great pains to render detail accurately (although these are not static copies, but lively, expressive drawings).      Fun Home has at once both a tear-inducing emotional rawness and a comic, belly-laugh inducing, almost gleeful sense of the absurdity of everyday family life.  Savor every frame--it took the author over seven years to produce, and given the state of the graphic novel (in the US) I fear it will be a while before we see another quite as good.

The very, very end is a little too neat,  tidy, and Hollywood, but the book is an absolute joy to read, and gives a marvelous sense of life in Afghanistan in the last 50 years beyond what one sees on CNN.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|Its an amazing rush to get this disc with so many bonus extras... On top of the almost 2 hours of concert, there are great interviews, Some Video Clips, and some fairly insightful Commentary.It would have been nice to get Ronnie to comment on the Concert, but thats hoping too much.  I first saw this is in a pristine Bootleg, with great stereo sound... the only difference is that there is a lengthy wait period at the start of the Bootleg, and time at the end.  There is not too much wrong with the Video expecially since it is a TV shot, and a PRO shot at that with no Fancy FX that some Video clip directors get into. Anyway, the ramp up of the audio is the biggest Bonus on this, since Ritchies Guitar sound is great, as is Cozy's drumming.  For anyone who has the Bootleg, it is well worth upgrading to this single disc version of all the items.  Also, no one seems to have mentioned that you get a reproduction of the Tour programme in the Disc. All this for like 10 dollars?? Wow, its a well worth it !!! I only wish there was more of DEEP PURPLE around of this quality.  ENJOY
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I saw both the HD-Discovery's Planet Earth and just purchased Planet Earth on Blu-Ray from Amazon (Attenborough's narration).  AWESOME, truly awesome. I am glad I cannot wear them out playing them over and over again for myself and family.   Sigourney Weaver does a good job as narrator of the U.S. version played on HD-Discovery and this version can be purchased from discovery.com. She has become an activist and honorary chair of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International and fights for animal rights. She has earned the right but;  David Attenborough's voice is so fitting to this type of documentary. (Even if he is so old that some of his pronunciations sounds like it is from an old Bob Dylan song, mumble mumble), the eye candy is mesmerizing and his voice projects the scene where Sigourney just does a good job at narration (sometimes I waited for the ding for her to turn the page)  I agree with some of the \\"setup\\" they had to compromise in filming this documentary. The Great White shark scenes grabbing the seals looked familiar, from an older PBS special. I thought the seals looked familiar flying through the air. Ahhh, the same underfed seals. On Blu-Ray, it is easier to see the 50 lb fishing line that is actually pulling what appears to be a cut up neoprene wetsuit, cut to look like a seal. You can clearly see the fishing line in the lower right corner of the 2 jumping shark scenes, ripping through the water, as they trolled the \\"lure\\" through the water. Hmmm, gotta love the clarity of the Blu-Ray, huh. Oh well, to get the footage, I guess they could have \\"fished\\" with a real seal and just waited but I much preferred their approach. Totally mind bending to know that this is the way these sharks really feed, on a real seal. POWERFUL BEASTS!! The whole series is worth purchasing in HD (Blu-Ray or HD, but I read the Blu-Ray was clearest). Eye Candy,Eye Candy,Eye Candy, and more Eye Candy. This is the way I envisioned my HD TV. Pole to Pole, like watching it through awindow. The raw realistic power of nature, almost makes you want to.....RUN FOR SAFETY..........
B000KX0IOK|5.0|It's hard to elaborate on what's already been said, but Ryan Gosling gives one of the most centered, sincere and honest portrayals seen in a long time. He's matched every step of the way by young Shareeka Epps. Their unlikely bond helps them each to grow a bit, and even though the film is thoughtful (read: slow-moving), it's always compelling. It makes me question  the criteria of Oscar voters; Mr. Gosling was in practically every scene, and his performance is magnificent. Some fine messages to be learned by all.
1594489505|4.0|I read the Kite Runner several years ago and I must say it captivated me from the first page. I couldn't put it down and I was drawn into it by the characters and what they were going through and how they managed to overcome and at the end redeem themselves.    A Thousand Splendid Suns while a great read does not deliver the umph that The Kite Runner did. That is not to say that this wasn't a great book but I was not as enthralled by it in the beginning -- towards the middle of the book (and a bit sooner) is when I finally was able to be floored by his writing and by what happens in the book. If I gave it only four stars was because of that ... the fact that I couldn't put it down until about 50 or so pages in. Other than that, this book lives up to the hype.     I found myself gasping out loud at the hard life and hard times that Mariam had been handed down and by her ability to keep on looking forward. I cried at her misfortune and I cried at the end...her sacrifice will stay with me for a while and it proved to me that Hosseini is not afraid to write tragedy and he does it so poignantly that it reaches into the recesses of your heart strings and makes you feel the pain and the sense of impotence these women feel. The other central character(Laila) also struck a cord in me. I was able to some extent to identify with both women and the reasons why they did the things they did. I fell in love with both of them once their paths in lives converged and became one. There was no other option for them but to stick by the decisions that they both made.     Not only does the book depict the life of two women and how they come together and find a way to survive amidst all the tragedy that overtakes their beloved country and their men but finally (and possibly most importantly) the tragedy it is to be a woman in Afghanistan.     In the end it made me truly happy to live in a country where I can roam freely and state my opinion (even write a review for a book) and not be afraid of the repercussions.    A must read! Truly worth the wait.
0385733577|5.0|I was looking for something new after Harry Potter and saw this book on the New York Times Bestseller list. After reading several rave reviews, I decided to pick it up, then could not put it down! The character are based on real people who really existed and the story takes place in present day California. The story is also full of mythological characters. The first book takes place over two days and the entire six book series happens over two months.  What I most enjoyed about this book is the imagination of the author. His writing is very unique and he takes you into a world you could never imagine. Curious to see what challenges this will present for the movie version coming out in 2009.
1594489505|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  It's told more from a female perspective than his previous book, The Kite Runner, which I also loved!  A Thousand Splendid Suns educated me even more about conditions in Afghanastan.

B0002V7O3I|5.0|The Amazon reviewer must have been on something when he reviewed \\"Explorers\\".  It is nothing like \\"Contact\\", which is entirely humorless. I saw \\"Explorers\\" with my kids and all of us loved it; it's one of those films that both parents and kids can like (I had to watch SO MANY idiotic flicks with them, to watch this was heaven!). It is quite an intelligent film, and it makes some good, solid satirical points at the same time never losing its sense of fun. It is an absolutely delightful flick. If you have young ones, see it with them. I couldn't remember the title of this flick or who was in it, so I went to \\"e-opinions\\" looking at lists of best 10 kids films that others had sent in.  The same old stuff. None mentioned this film.    I haven't seen this film in years, but still remember scenes from it. They just stay with you. It is one of those neglected films that are deserving of more of an  audience. Toss Disney overboard! See \\"Explorers\\"!!!!
B000001GAE|5.0|I have had this disc for years, but have recently begun listening again after migrating to Zimerman, Argerich, Brendel, et al. for some time.  When I first pulled it out again, I was simply blown away by the surpassing depth and utter poetry of Pollini's playing, and am more so with each listen.      After the mysterious descending scales and sudden explosion of the Allegro energico, what is immediately remarkable here are the rough inner edges, with the repeated notes of the section marked \\"agitato\\" emerging insistently and ferociously.  Indeed, at various points throughout the piece, Pollini's hands seem to have been overtaken by a kind of mechanical fury--only to give way, often instantaneously and unexpectedly, to the most ethereally beautiful playing.  In any event, the first instantiation of the grandioso theme is magnificent, with the thundering chords delivered in a perfectly suspended balance of total control and possessed frenzy.  At the end of this passage, the four questioning chords have the sound of a much-needed breath.  At this point, the dolce con grazia emerges, utterly crystalline.  Again, Pollini's playing is so simple--almost ascetically plain--one begins to drift upward into a quasi-unconscious space.  I find myself holding my breath as Pollini moves into the cantando espressivo...      I will not go through each incredible passage in this recording, but must mention the beautiful control and instantaneous changes in tone and dynamics in the fugue, the wild and elemental energy in the rushing downward octaves at the end of the prestissimo section (which Pollini sounds barely able to keep under his fingers, even though he is obviously in complete control), and the rough-edged, uneven beauty of the returning grandioso theme.  In that latter section, other pianists produce the usual, rather overwrought grandeur, while Pollini's version sounds, perfectly, like a series of quickly drawn breaths, perhaps reflecting the extraordinary exertions of thepreceding section.      Finally, there is simply no other account on disc which achieves what Pollini does at the Sonata's conclusion.  Pollini leaves increasingly long pauses between the three bright-sounding chords in the piano's upper register, which sound as if suspended in some unearthly space.  During the extremely long pause into which the second of these chords expires, one drifts into a partly unconscious state, only to be pulled back suddenly to await that final dark b natural, which Pollini delivers after another long pause with a decisive parting groan.  Where other performances of this piece--even excellent ones--merely play through the final notes, Pollini creates one of the most transcendental experiences in all of music.
006441034X|2.0|Some of this author's early books are entertaining even for adults in the same way Harry Potter is, but this book is very difficult to get through because of the nonsensical plot. You can feel the author trying very hard to make something out of an idea, and spinning out prose just for the sake of making a longer book, but it is a very very thin story. It was much better conceptualized as an animated film by Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli), also of the same title, because the film made much better use of the characters.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|One of the most emotional and communicative pieces of music and songwriting I have heard in a long time.  This woman knows life and gives voice to her life and her lessons.  Her songs unleash your heart and allow the tears to flow.  It's beautiful.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|Let me start of by saying that Kelly Clarkson is by far my favorite former-Idol.  She's easily got some of the best pipes out there.  I eagerly anticipated her first release (which I loved) and even fell in line when she seemingly changed stylistic directions with 'Breakway' - one listen to 'Where Is Your Heart' and I just got it.    However, this right here, this hook-free, jumbled mess called 'My December', never should have seen the light of day.  It's unlistenable.  I certainly understand artists wanting to challenge themselves, whether it be through songwriting or production, but her vanity clearly got the best of her and her label had every right to be concerned - from beginning to end, this cd is..well, it's just bad.  Painfully bad.    Am I still a fan of her voice?  Absolutely.  I think everyone's entitled to their musical equivalent of 'Ishtar'.  But after this turkey of a project, I probably won't be so eager to run out and snatch up her next release without some serious forethought.
B000069HZP|4.0|With the twists and turns of this movie you'd think the director where M. Night Shyamalan.  Have you ever had your life \\"messed\\" with?  Had a game played on you?  Had your identity stolen or the goverment give you the run around when its something vital to you!?  That is what this movie is about and it does it very well to Michael Douglas!  He's a wealthy man who signs up for this \\"wealthy people, thrill seeking game!\\"  He gets much, much more than he bargained for!  So well...you've got to see the ending and its WOW!!!
0345448162|5.0|The mists of avalon is one of my favorite books. I've read all vertions of the arthurian leyend i've been able to find, and this is the most complete and explicit one (in my humble opinion). But this is not only a book, not only a novel, this story offers a way of seeing the world much differently and magicky than how he oftenly use to. I'm a celtic fan, i've been studiyng the celts for more than a quarter of my life and i had never seen a story so richly performed. In an esotheric library they put this book under \\"iniciatic novel\\", now, I know why. I LOVED IT! it's not only for celtic lovers, or arthurian or middle-age lovers. WONDERFUL<br />(sorry for the ortograph, i'm not a english-native speaker!) ;)
B0001O3YC6|4.0|However, not widely viewed prior to the release of Chronicles of Riddick.  This is a sci-fi thriller!  People marooned on a desert planet with a surprise when the sun goes down (\\"Pitch-Black).  Riddick as always is a tough guy whose character you will like and want to see him in more movies. The choice of characters was very good.  You develop distinct feelings towards each one and the writers did not let those emotions go to waste.  Excellent cinematography.  You will be on the edge of your seat waiting for the boogey men!
B000002B30|4.0|Bruce Springsteen's \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation, released in 1995, is not a very well selected compilation. For one thing, no tracks from his classic first two albums, [[ASIN:B0000024ZT Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.]] and [[ASIN:B000002513 The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle]] are included. For another thing, his latter day, fairly suspect albums like [[ASIN:B0000028SR Human Touch]] are granted as much representation as his rock n' roll standards [[ASIN:B00000255F Born to Run]] and [[ASIN:B0000025UW Born in the U.S.A.]]. Also, three of the four previously unreleased tracks have absolutely no business on this tracklist. But enough with my complaints. \\"Greatest Hits\\" showcases in my opinion the greatest performer and songwriter of rock 'n roll history over his long and winding career. All his musical artistry, lyrical power, and sheer entertainment are perfectly evident over the eighteen tracks. From the hard rocking \\"Badlands\\" to the inspired \\"Brilliant Disguise,\\" from the rock n' roll standards \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Thunder Road\\" to the [[ASIN:B00000255F Born to Run]]-cut \\"Murder Incorporated,\\" from the anthemic \\"Dancin' in the Dark\\" to the subtly moving \\"Atlantic City\\" and \\"Streets of Philadelphia,\\" these songs rock. This isn't a perfect compilation by any means, and in this day and age when anyone can create their own compilations, some might steer clear. But this music is purely top notch here. For those just getting into Bruce or others just hoping to get some of their old favorites in the collection, this might be the one to buy.
B00005JKHP|4.0|The first half of this movie is about connecting the dots from the end of the TV series to this first movie.  The beginning also focuses on the main Star Trek Characters, Kirk, Spock, Scotty and Bones.  It was a unique plot with a twist at the end.  The last half of the movie is all mystery and special effects.  What is ... and finding clue after clue trying to piece together the puzzle; which does not become clear until the end.  If you like sci-fi/mystery in outer space this is the show for you!
B000069HKH|4.0|In 2002, Bruce Springsteen returned with his album \\"The Rising,\\" his first studio album in almost eight years. But more importantly, it marked his first album with the E Street Band, his supporting cast from his 1970s and 80s classics, in eighteen years. A lot has changed in all this time, and this is reflected in many ways. Bruce certainly has a little commentary on post-9/11 life on \\"The Rising,\\" but it doesn't dominate the subject matter. Musically, he shows a newfound influence of folk and even country music. But what's most refreshing is really how much things are the same. It was great to hear Springsteen singing rock n' roll songs with Clarence Clemmons, Stevie Van Zandt, Max Weinberg, and the rest of the band again. \\"The Rising\\" is fifteen tracks deep, and the music is pretty diverse. During the tracklist, a hard rocking band piece will be followed by a simple, musically subtle one (a la \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\"), which might be followed by a track heavy with violins and strings. But for the most part, \\"The Rising\\" is as musically fulfilling, catchy, and interesting as any past Springsteen project. He branches into new territory, but the experimental instrumentation and collaboration is quite welcome. The folk influence is most noticeable, with the frequent violins and simple yet inspirational lyricism in many songs. The production and songwriting is for the most part very high quality. And lyrically, Bruce occassionally shows a glimpse of the depressed narrator he was earlier in his career. \\"The Rising\\" is another winner in the incredible Springsteen catalog.<br /><br />The album begins with my favorite track, the excellent \\"Lonesome Day.\\" The band is at their finest here, constructing a melody that builds with strings and nice percussion. Bruce's lyrics are simple yet effective, and this song is very memorable. \\"Into the Fire\\" is an understated midtempo number, sparse and easy. \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" is a highlight, joyful and catchy. I absolutely love \\"Nothing Man,\\" a beautiful somber song featuring an excellent performance from Bruce. \\"Countin' on a Miracle\\" and \\"Empty Sky\\" both are meant to be motivational, and musically are quite fulfilling. \\"Worlds Apart\\" takes influence from tribal music, and it's a very interesting approach. \\"Lets Be Friends (Skin to Skin)\\" and \\"Further On (Up the Road)\\" are both excellent, followed by the good \\"The Fuse\\" which precedes the album's most unforgettable song, the anthem \\"Mary's Place.\\" This six minute song features the band at their best, rocking on a gorgeous arrangement. \\"You're Missing\\" is a nice late-album track, and the title track builds into a pumped-up rock song. After the slow \\"Paradise,\\" the album closes on a truly beautiful note, \\"My City of Ruins.\\" In this song, Bruce takes an inspired look at his dilapidated hometown of Asbury Park, New Jersey, and maybe even at his nation as a whole. In any event, this song is excellent and a perfect end to the album.<br /><br />I think Bruce really accomplished everything that \\"The Rising\\" was meant to with this album. It's a very worthy addition to the Springsteen discography, and I highly recommend it.Man,\\" a beautiful somber song featuring an excellent performance from Bruce. \\"Countin' on a Miracle\\" and \\"Empty Sky\\" both are meant to be motivational, and musically are quite fulfilling. \\"Worlds Apart\\" takes influence from tribal music, and it's a very interesting approach. \\"Lets Be Friends (Skin to Skin)\\" and \\"Further On (Up the Road)\\" are both excellent, followed by the good \\"The Fuse\\" which precedes the album's most unforgettable song, the anthem \\"Mary's Place.\\" This six minute song features the band at their best, rocking on a gorgeous arrangement. \\"You're Missing\\" is a nice late-album track, and the title track builds into a pumped-up rock song.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I'm a relatively new fan.  I had bought the movie out of curiosity a few months after it came out on DVD.  I watched it but didn't pay much attention to it and so afterwards I shelved it for awhile.  Then one day, while at home with nothing to do I popped it in again.  That second time I paid attention.  It changed my life.    I then ordered Firefly: The Complete Series and I am so sorry I discovered Firefly/Serenity so late.  It may have been a good thing because it would be incredibly painful to have gon ethrough what some other fans have with the abrupt cancellation of this one of a kind series.  Oddly enough, I have fallen so in love with the characters and the story that I feel the pain.     In an era of television where there are a set of sci-fo series out there that are not as good but last longer - Firefly's discontinuation is an insult and a clear act of stupidity on the part of network execs who do not know the aesthetic value of art vs. the garbage that plagues TV - especially one so out of the ordinary.      Firefly/Serenity is truly a remarkable project.  It is a very smart series.  This is no oridnary science fiction.  It is also, as another reviewer observed, a commentary on socio-political world affairs and our desire to truly be free as a human race.    It would be a true travesty if Serenity is the end.  SOmetimes an author or a creator has a certain responsibility to the characters, the universe, and stories around them that they have created.  Maybe even more than the responsibility they have for the fans.  Firefly/Serenity's universe is just to rich, too great, and too special to be left alone.  There is so much more to be done and to be said. This is truly the greatest Sci-Fi series/film I have ever had the honor to see and experience.  I urge Whedon to make this happen again - have Firefly/Serenity continue.
0316018953|3.0|I, too, wish I'd really paid attention to the title. It says a lot. I was greatly disappointed. And I like Michael's work a great deal. Thankfully, as a retired escort, I had Erica Black's \\"The Call Girl Actress, Confessions of a Lesbian Escort\\" in my beach bag. It's a great read.
B00004SW9R|4.0|I have no way of knowing what effect Dr John had on British music listeners in 1968. He must have seemed incredibly exotic and menacing. Perhaps people were scared to play the record in case Dr John appeared on their doorstep in the middle of the night, holding a snake in his hand. Although Gris-Gris was not a hit, I have seen it linked to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, who were apparently influenced by its colourful voodoo patois, and it was the kind of thing that was well-known by every hip young person at the time.    The album is a bit like \\"Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\\", in the sense that it is a concept album about a fictional character, although it doesn't tell a story - instead, it's Dr John's calling card. Throughout the album Dr John builds up a legend of himself. He tells us that he is a witch doctor who can cure all known diseases with his pungent bag of gris-gris, and that he is \\"le grand zombi\\". The shamanistic image is hard to take seriously nowadays, but it is fun. I don't know what people in Britain thought of New Orleans in 1968, and if people really believed that Dr John was a shaman. The photographs make him look like an overweight computer geek with a teenage beard, and his voice is not as deep and croaky as I expected. Perhaps in 1968 it was possible for a British person to envisage New Orleans as a scary haunted swamp full of voodoo practitioners, but not in 2007. According to the internet that I have on my desktop, New Orleans is a modern city with office blocks and dual carriageways, and a domed sports stadium. I suppose you have to let yourself go a little bit, in order to succumb to the atmosphere.    The songs are based on shuffling grooves, with a very loose feel. A couple of them are faster, but still not very fast. The album was produced in a hurry, but it has a big open sound. It's mostly acoustic, with a good heavy sound, particularly on \\"Danse Kalinda Ba Doom\\". It's one of those 60s stereo records where the voices are in one channel and the instruments are in another. The backing vocals are typically in the right channel, and you can remix the album by moving the balance control to the left. Because of this it sounds a little odd on headphones.    The music reminds me of \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" (particularly \\"Mama Roux\\"), but it is generally slower and more skeletal. It is accompanied by some lady backing singers, who slink and slither like sirens. It would be unwise to follow them into the swamp. The big standout track is \\"I Walk on Gilded Splinters\\", which is the longest track on the album, at seven minutes. It has a wonderful echo effect whereby Dr John delivers a line, and his backing singers follow him. The song is the best synthesis of music and the Dr John image. It is spooky, mysterious, threatening, and has a big booming bass drum. I have no idea what it is about, exactly - it seems to be a prayer for vengeance - but it has a feeling to it.    The rest of the album divides into two halves. \\"Danse Kalinda Ba Doom\\" and \\"Croker Courtbullion\\" are hypnotic dance tunes. Dr John does not sing in either of them. \\"Danse Kalinda\\" is the best; it is more intense than \\"Croker Courtbullion\\", which sounds weaker once you hear \\"Kalinda\\". \\"Mama Roux\\" and \\"Jump Sturdy\\" are relatively conventional songs. They both seem to be about the kind of women a young man should avoid. \\"Jump Sturdy\\" is the album's only disaster; it's a simple jaunty number that sounds like a song from Sesame Street, with the kind of catchy but irritating chorus that will one day be sampled in a hip-hop song. \\"Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya\\" is a menacing slice of pure atmosphere, and is the perfect introduction.    \\"Danse Fambeaux\\" is a simple set of bass chords that loop around and around, with Dr John and his backing singers improvising over the top. It ends with a plea for crème brûlée. I like it; the song, that is. But I also like crème brûlée, although not to the exclusion of a social life.    Gris-Gris probably does not have the same effect today that it would have had back in 1968, but it's still the kind of album you need to hear at least once. I haven't heard anything else by Dr John. I understand his career wobbled after this, with a couple of real high points and a lot of dull nothingness. I do like crème brûlée.
1594489505|5.0|Dr. Hosseini has come through once again. I loved Kite Runner, and now this has been a great read as well. Quite the summer beach reading. I took this and \\"The Call Girl Actress, Confessions of a Lesbian Escort\\" by Erica Black to the beach for summer reads. Loved them both, especially as I'm a 59 year old retired call girl.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I used to be a registered Republican, and when Michael More came to speak at Utah Valley State College, I had considered joining the protesters.  Now when I look at it, what a moron I was to to go along with a movement conservative or liberal without investigating the issue and judging for myself.    People always bring up the part in this movie about Bush sitting in the class room and not doing anything when he heard 911 was taking place.  I would like to challenge anyone who hasn't seen this movie to watch it and then tell me what part of it isn't true or is exaggerated other than that one seen.    I have learned a valuable lesson here about judging a book by it's cover so to speak, and making judgments based on something I know nothing about.    I would also recommend watching [[ASIN:B000FBH3W2 Why We Fight]]
B00008OWZC|5.0|Do we really need another review of what is quickly becoming the definitive live album of Zepplin? Probably not. But hey, that's not gonna stop me from saying what an immensely satisfying live album this is.<br /><br />First of all, take it in context. 1972 was the year we saw Pink Floyd's Obscured by Clouds,\\" the Grateful Dead's \\"Europe '72,\\" Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust,\\" Don McLean's \\"American Pie,\\" and Lou Reed's \\"Transformer.\\" And if those records aren't dizzying enough, Zepplin soared above all of them.<br /><br />By this stage of their career, Zepplin was functioning on another plane of existence, but fortunately they'd gate in from time to time and share the majesty of their creations. Prepare to fail those will saves.
1582701709|5.0|Forget scientific theories.  Positive doesn't attract negative. This may be true for magnets but just think in your own life.  Negative thoughts and actions attract negative thoughts and actions from others around you.  And just the same with positive thoughts. It is the power of your own thoughts than determines your immediate world.  I don't know if \\"The Secret\\" can attract wealth, but it can attract happiness and a sense of well-being.  I was uplifted after listening to the first CD.  I sent the CD with my husband so he could listen to it on his way to work.  I called him on his way home and could hear a difference in his voice.  I said you listened to it, didn't you. He had.  Enough said.   P.S.  I've ordered 3 other copies of the CD's to give away. I've heard from others that the book is difficult to read though
0143038419|5.0|I am an avid reader, and often find books I thoroughly enjoy -- enough to eagerly pass along the title/author to friends, for example -- but rarely if ever get motivated enough to write a review myself in this kind of venue.  I just finished \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" this afternoon and am confident I will be returning to it repeatedly to revisit the vivid characters and to think through the varied philosophical and spiritual ideas and tenets with which the author herself wrestles.  Many times while reading I found myself agreeing with something she wrote, or thinking to myself, \\"What a great way to express that -- I've felt that or thought that, but have never been able to put it into words!\\"    I am always curious about others' perspectives, particularly when I so love a book, and read the one star reviews here before writing my own.  I found them jarring and in some ways intriguing, but mostly perplexing, especially because my experience with the book was so entirely positive. I was startled to see that some felt the author to be exceedingly narcissistic and self-absorbed.  That wasn't my experience at all.      What I find odd about such negative ratings and such vehemence about this book's inferiority or the author's shortcomings is that the overwhelmingly positive message I received from the book is to love yourself and love others, just as you are.  Certainly, all are entitled to their own opinions.  It does seem sad to me though that anyone would have such hateful things to say about someone with such an uplifting positive and personal message to share.
0553583182|4.0|Great book. Although this version ommits some citations and references that are part of the original document.
0471463396|5.0|Fantastic summary of modern value investing.  Greenwald looks at the discipline with the critical eye of a professor, making it more informative than many other books about the subject.  Even seasoned value investors will learn from this book.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I purchased this album the day it came out because they're my favorite band and I'm one of those abstract fanatics. I wanted to wait to write a review so I can fully digest it and I'm glad I did because I absolutely now see how awesome this album really is. For me, and I'm sure many other hardcore DT fans, we already know how awesome they are and we don't know what to expect from them next therefore we become critical. This album really does deliver all around with diversity and song writing. The epic \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" is an amazing composition that is played as one live but was divided into two for the album because they didn't want to repeat what they did for Octavarium. The melodies thrown into the mix on this song and the absolutely keen build ups of intensity are absolutely phenomenal! This song gives me such an awesome feeling inside whenever I listen to it. \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\" is the second longest song that is also quite epic and once again I'm glad I allowed this song to grow on me because I despised it at first. I thought it was slow moving and didn't go anywhere until I let my blindfold of ignorance be taken off and realize they have to calm down once in a while and the slow verses and choruses are merely a very nice tranquil melody that does a great job of building up into some superb instrumental work. \\"Repentance\\" is the only song I don't really care for. I would love the song if it was made properly, it could've easily ended at 5 or 6 minutes but making it drag out to as long as nearly 11 minutes really makes me feel like it's nothing more than unnecessary filler. You don't have to make an 80 minute CD every time, it wouldn't kill them to end it at 70. \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" is definitely a favorite of mine. These guys are now in their 40s and they can still write a song that is so very rapid, fast, and very impressive! Love this song, energetic as all hell. All-in-all this is up there with one of my favorite DT CDs, they remainmy absolute favorite band of all time and I eternally long for what they will come out with next. (Yes, it's true, I'm one of the guys that says DT can do NO wrong, deal with it!)
B000PFU7OO|5.0|After seeing the movie Once and being haunted by its beautiful, lyrical music, I had to buy the CD.  The songs are simple, yet powerful, with folk and ballad undercurrents.  Once is my favorite CD purchase of the year.  Thank you Glen and Marketa for listenng to your muses!
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This is the best sitcom on tv right now.  How I Met Your Mother is a comedy about 5 friends in New York. Ted and his best friend Marshall are old college buddies and share an apartment above their favorite bar, MacLaren's. Lily also went to college with Ted and at the start of the series has been dating  Marshall for eight years. Barney is a single guy always on the prowl. He met Ted at MacLaren's. One fateful night, Barney uses his wingman line, \\"Have you met Ted?\\" to introduce Ted to Robin, and the story begins.  It's often described as \\"seinfeld with a heart,\\" but it is so much more than that.  Each character has its specific charm.  The casting is excellent.  Neil Patrick Harris redefines himself as the outrageous and funny Barney Stinson.    Season 1 available on dvd, season 2 dvd coming in august 2007, this fall season 3 Mondays 9:30/8:30c on CBS
B0000542D2|5.0|This is a story around the Beatles'fame. A Humorous entertaining story with the Beatles' music which is well loved. I love this two volume DVD which includes interviews on the making of the movie because I love their music and their humor and always loved them since being a little girl. Their music is intriguing, inspiring and entertaining. They are musical geniuses.
B000N6UERK|5.0|I just finished with this movie and can say it was excellent.  First I must compliment Disney on another excellent HD transfer to Blu-ray.  Their movies have been exceptionally good on Blu-ray.  Visually and audio wise.<br /><br />Now the movie.  This story will keep you on your toes.  With a approach that almost seems like a science fiction film it pulls it off very credibly.  Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances and shows that his career is far from dead.  It's important to observe everything for future refrence.  At times you will feel like you are having your own case of deja vu.  The story is played off very well.  Jerry Bruckheimer puts together another action classic.<br /><br />What makes this movie so good is that it's not predictable.  Just when you think things are going bad there is a twist, turn, and flip.  The story is in that many places and it does so very well keeping you glued to your seat.  I would advise this as a must see for anyone who enjoy good action flicks.
B000065MT7|5.0|In case there is cross posting of products this is a review of the Special widescreen edition DVD.<br /><br />I will not go through the story as you can read my review of the book. However the basic primes is of a boy who grows up as the orphan nephew of a family that does not believe in magic only to find that he is a famous wizard. How will he handle his situation and the interaction with friends?<br /><br />The movie its self as with all movies would have to be a mini-series to incorporate all the nuances of the book. However this movie does an excellent job of selection and gives the overall feel of the story.<br /><br />Naturally comparing and contrasting this story with others in it genre you will always find a better or a favorite. This in no way diminishes the excellent story and the cohesiveness of the movie.
B00000K3UU|5.0|This is by far Adam Sandler's best comedy.  Adam plays a guy that just can't seem to grow up and get responsible (so typical of his characters).  You felt sorry for this guy at the same time, you laughed at him.  I saw this movie with my young nephews and all we did was laugh.  Isn't this suppose to be what comedies are made to do?  A very entertaining film that you don't have to think, just enjoy.  Wonderful!  Buy it...
B00070DK1E|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Jethro Tull harsh movement from electronic rock was already determined to fail with Under Wraps, while Crest Of A Knave aims more into a hard rock condition, being a better musical approach, it still possesses some recognizable electronic features in a still comfortable way, as Ian Anderson's excitement into electronic keyboards was now cooling of, making an accurate hard rock. Heavy metal grammy? of course it didn't deserve it, this album is far away from being a heavy metal album, while Barre's signature guitar make all the songs in Crest Of A Knave qualify into hard rock with electronic features, just with the exception of both more calm \\"Budapest\\" and \\"The Waking Edge\\". Still, this is much more of a promissing album since quite few of their past works, its still much more talented, although, of course, they were still trying to fit into a much more updated sound, resulting in somewhat awkward atmospheres with crude critics. Still, their most notable traces of electronic rock are notorious on the opening \\"Steel Monkey\\", while the following \\"Farm On The Freeway\\" keeps more performance credit and some much more comprehensible melodies. Of course, this mixture of electronic rock with hard rock sounds awkward into terms of comparing it with their other works, and the aspect of unaccessible music for casual listeners is obviously present (and I say it within my own experience, this was once my first Tull album and I really thought they were an electronic rock band), but in its own contextures, the calm but very intriguing, original \\"Budapest\\" is here a true gem, it even became a minor hit, as its foreign flavour and musical versatility with its slow burning, passionate moods make it one of their best in their whole career, it is unnoticeable for being 10 minutes long. The moody, anti-war \\"Mountain Men\\" stands also remarkable, while the playful mood in \\"Dogs In The Midwinter\\" and the comfortable guitars in \\"Jump Start\\" both possess Jethro Tull's much more recognizable music. \\"Raising Steam\\" may stand as the most hard rocking. A detail about their performance is that Ian Anderson's voice sounds a lot like the Dire Straits' vocalist, in result of a recent (at that time) throat surgery. An awkward mood may surround the album, but in its own contextures is a great musical experience, much more comprehensible for previous fans, and quite a more promissing album than their previous three works.more recognizable music. \\"Raising Steam\\" may stand as the most hard rocking.

B0006Z2KX4|5.0|This is the definitive screwball comedy of all time.  Cary Grant has more quirky looks at Kate Hepburn than any leading man with her.  Cary Grant shows his usual charm and versatility at being a comic actor.  Kate Hepburn plays a very scatterbrained heiress and is at her best.  Oh, \\"baby\\" does not refer to Hepburn, but a leopard!  So if you also like animals this is the comedy for you.  This film (1938) is pure funniness and just plain entertaining.  Another great addition to any collector of classic films or comedies...
B000P0IW6E|5.0|What can I say. This CD got me to clean my apartment when my AC was busted and it was 85 degrees in here. It's not LAFS or Blackout but it is a more mature Scorpions with lots of hooks and great harmonies. I have quite a few of the songs from this CD stuck in my head. Worth every cent even if you have to buy it as an import. ENJOY....
6305657947|5.0|This remake of a Steve Mc Queen movie is much better than the original and it took some convincing for me to even look at this film, but once I did, wow!  Pierce is by far my favorite Bond and his character is an action packed one as well. He plays the perfect man--suave and debonair.  His antics as a billionaire playboy are entertaining!  The love scene with Rene Russo was so hot, you have to control yourself.  This movie has it all--action, comedy and pure entertainment.  You never get bored with it.  A great buy.
B000P2A24W|1.0|I had to listen to this out of curiosity.  What a waste of time!  Bon Jovi and their big hair sucked back in the eighties, and they suck almost as bad as a country band.  Won't this guy ever go away?  If you want to hear some real rock, try Zeppeln, Purple, Sabbath or Motorhead.  If you want some real country, try Johnny Cash, Willie, Merle, Robert Earl Keen, Emmylou, Steve Earle, Billy Joe Shaver, The Flatlanders, etc.  There are plenty of good artists in both categories.  Bon Jovi is pathetic!!  He needs to go back to Jersey and clean some recording studios.  Did another reveiwer compare him to Springsteen?  Gimme a break.
B00004T0US|5.0|wow.What can you say knowing when this disc ends its almost symbolic of the day the music died...August 16,1977.But really it hasn't and never will.Elvis and his music have stood and will continue to stand the test of time.This is truly a great work.He won many awards in 77 for this album and for the title track Moody Blue.His version of He'll Have To Go is awesome.Unchained Melody...taken from his live concert in Dallas...is what makes this album a classic.Way Down is a Elvis standard...a song that gives proof to what I've been saying...Elvis made a song walk.Pledging My Love and his live versions of Let Me Be There and If You Love Me Let Me Know are must hears.Moody Blue...both the song and album...serve as a beautiful farewell from the heart of the singer who gave his away in each and every song.Thank you Elvis.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I'll admit I went into this movie a bit biased; I had heard an interview with Pierce Brosnan where he said that the directors of Casino Royale had initially cast him in the Bond role, only to cut him halfway through and go with Daniel Craig. And as I am a huge Brosnan fan, I was very disappointed with the choice of Craig. I may be the only one to say this, but I just can't see Craig as Bond. I know the point was to get back to a more average-looking Bond, rather than a handsome Bond, and Craig is certainly not handsome to me!     I nearly walked out partway through the movie because that's how much I didn't like it. To me, it was a $7.50 waste. I would have been better off seeing The Departed again instead.
B000A1OG2W|5.0|I caught wind of Editors on a trip to London in Fall, 2005, and bought their debut album right then and there. It immediately became one of my favorite albums of that year. The album eventually got a proper US release in the Spring of 2006 and I saw Editors several times in concert last year, on which they played several unknown songs to me, which I eventually gathered were B sides from a number of their singles.<br /><br />Fast forward... Last weekend, shopping at my local indie-record store (Everybody's Records), I happen to fall on this limited release in the used CD bin (for the incredible price of $7.99) and I immediately snapped it up of course.<br /><br />This 2 CD set consists of the main album (11 tracks, 43 min,) and I won't go into discussing that here. The second CD \\"Cuttings\\" (6 tracks, 25 min.) comprises of B-sides of various singles, and what a beauty it is. Opener \\"Let Your Good Heart Lead You Home\\" starts of very tentatively, to eventually burst into full blown Editors-rock. It is followed by \\"You Are Fading\\", one of those songs I heard in concert, it is a great tune, an Editors classic, actually. \\"Colours\\" is an upbeat track that is just as good, if not better, than the regular album tracks. \\"Release\\" is another one of the tunes I heard live which I am now glad to have on CD. \\"Crawl Down the Wall\\" and \\"Forest Fire\\" are the other 2 songs on here, they are nice but non-essential. In all, a fabulous (and necessary) addition to the early Editors catalogue.<br /><br />The new Editors album was released 2 weeks ago in the UK, and will be released in the US on July 17. Can't wait for that, frankly. Meanwhile, if you are into Editors, and you have a chance to pick up this limited 2 CD release, don't hesitate.

B000OONQBM|4.0|Nine delegates from every gang from every neighbourhood across New York meet in an empty stadium to hear a speech on taking control of the city from a messianic and enigmatic overlord known as Cyrus.<br /><br />The Warriors: Cleon, Swan, Ajax, Vermin, Cochise, Snow, Cowboy, Fox and Rembrandt travel all the way from Coney Island to be a part of this massive gathering with dozens of other rival gangs. Things go very, very wrong!<br /><br />As you are probably aware, so called \\"unseen editions\\" and \\"extended editions\\" are pretty common on DVD and are usually lousy films with some extra filler thrown in to fool unsuspecting buyers. This is not the case with The Warriors. Like Daredevil or Aliens, this is one of those \\"director's cuts\\" that really makes a difference.<br /><br />First and foremost are the comic book transitions and the new opening. Writer/director Walter Hill felt that his original presentation of the film was a little lost on the audience of the time and its subsequent cult status on video. This new cut draws parallels with the 4th century BC legend of Anabasis, in which an army of Greek mercenaries are left stranded after their leader Cyrus the Younger has been killed. If they can make it through 1000 miles of hostile territory to the ocean, they will be safe.<br /><br />The Warriors, as you know, must make it through all the tough neighbourhoods of NY to Coney Island after they are wrongfully blamed for the assassination of mega-gang boss Cyrus. A loose, but truly inspired connection.<br /><br />Back in the Seventies, there weren't just certain neighbourhoods in New York that you avoided. The whole damn city was infested with crime and scum. The gangs were plentiful and they really did OWN the streets. The scenario of all gangs joining together to form one big Uber-gang may seem far fetched today, but if Mayor Giuliani had left the city to decay then NY's future might well have ended up this way. But the fact that the Big Apple is a helluva lot safer these days doesn't lessen the overall impact of The Warriors.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the Greek history inspiration is clever. But the film is also based on a Fifties novel by Sol Yurick and director Hill took a comic book approach to bring it to life. He was aware of the film's silliness, but coupled with the sense of adventure and episodic battles, a pulp fiction take could make it seem believable. For all we know, maybe there was a gang called The Baseball Furies, who went about with painted faces, beating invaders to a pulp. These were wild times.<br /><br />The Director's Cut also makes the photography and editing more apparent. Hill frames the movie to look like comic book panels and, as usual, Freeman Davies' (Hill's favourite editor) cutting gives The Warriors a sleek and fast-paced look.<br /><br />Hill is an action director of considerable talent, who is often overlooked. Films such as 48 Hours (and it's under-rated sequel), Southern Comfort, Trespass and Last Man Standing have never been massive hits, so his hardcore style is only familiar to fans of his work, rather than general movie audiences. Which is a shame!<br /><br />Now is the time to rediscover The Warriors and be reintroduced to a cult classic. I know a lot of people are purists and will decry the Director's Cut as a cheap stunt to make more money, but I honestly think it's the superior, definitive version.<br /><br />Judge for yourself; you might just agree with me.<br /><br />The HD-DVD features a brilliant 1.85:1 1080p picture that is so clean and colorful you'll think that the film is just fresh out of the cinemas and not 28 years old. Ditto for the sound. Originally a plain stereo movie, the DVD comes with a remastered Dolby Digital Plus sound design and it's amazing. The songs come through loud and full of life and the dialogue natural. The sound effects were never that sophisticated, but there's loads of ambience to be had and you'll still be surprised at how good the movie sounds without ever seeming artificial. A decent amount of extras are also included.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I found it gratifying to finally have a script and a director that paid homage to Fleming's characterization of Bond, eschewing the tongue-in-cheekiness.  After all, Fleming himself described Bond as Her Majesty's (somewhat sadistic) blunt weapon.  This film could have been perfect, had it not been for an over-the-top finale, and a completely ridiculous scene involving a portable defibrilator.      One last, minor quibble and IMHO, had it been my decision, I would have made it a period piece, with Le Chiffre a renegade cold-warrior.
B000N6U0E2|2.0|Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but the script is not up to the challenge.  My expectation was to see an uplifting film about a man beating the odds.  Mostly what I got was the undeniable awful side of society.  I realize it is based on a real person's life, but half way through the film, I got the feeling the person did not know that there is a safety net call welfare, and that my uplifting movie turned out to be for the most part, a long squeamish downer.<br />I bought the DVD - This one is not a keeper.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|I have to say that The White Stripes are one of the most interesting acts in the music business currently.  Jack always finds a way to make the Stripes sounds different with each forthcoming album and there are few acts that can boast of that.  Jack's unique vocals, writing skills, and multi-instrumental talents coupled with Meg's drum skills always make for a superb affair. I would even venture to say that The White Stripes couldn't make a bad album if they wanted to.  Sure, ICKY THUMP is different than perhaps the more critically lauded GET BEHIND ME SATAN (which I must say sometimes gets a bad wrap despite being exceptional as any other Stripes release), but it is different in a good respect.  To be honest, Icky Thump rocks more than GET BEHIND ME SATAN ever did with it's country, piano (and marimba) driven tendencies.  Aside from particulars, ICKY THUMP is a welcome addition to the White Stripes's discography. I'm sure than the Grammy for best Alternative Music Album will once again go to ICKY THUMP as it went to both ELEPHANT and GET BEHIND ME SATAN. Here's a brief rundown of the tracks:<br /><br />1. Icky Thump - 4/5: an exceptional first single; I love the vocal performance by Jack here in particular.  This is clearly going down as a Stripes classic.<br /><br />2. You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)- 4/5: Another brilliant performance that rocks pretty hard.  The guitars are anthemic in timbre and Jack sounds top-rate here.  I particularly like the refrain here.<br /><br />3. 300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues- 4/5:  Lengthy, but worth the duration. The acoustic guitars work exceptionally well here coupled with traces of electric guitars and Meg's drumming, which has never sounded better (I promise I'm not being sarcastic!).<br /><br />4. Conquest- 5/5:  Perhaps my favorite Stripes track to date? Hard to believe that Jack didn't pen this track.<br /><br />5. Bone Broke- 4/5: some sick guitar work in this one! Rocks hard!<br /><br />6. Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn- 4/5: Not my favorite, but top-rate nonetheless.  The \\"Scottish\\" feel is quite unique and the drum groove is infectious with the emphasis of on the beats with the bass drum (Go Meg!).<br /><br />7. St. Andrew (This Battle Is In The Air)- a continuation of \\"Prickly Thorn...\\"<br /><br />8. Little Cream Soda- 4.5/5: Can you say exceptional?! This one is mostly instrumental with a couple of choice lyrics.  Can't miss this awesome track.<br /><br />9. Rag And Bone- 4/5: A fun track; I love how playful the Stripes are here.. this certainly wouldn't have fit on GET BEHIND ME SATAN.  Again the groove and guitars are phenomenal.<br /><br />10. I'm Slowly Turning Into You- 4.5/5: Another favorite of mine - the groove won't leave you.  You'll keep humming this one after hearing it.<br /><br />11. A Martyr For My Love For You- 3.5/5: 100% solid, just not my favorite<br />12. Catch Hell Blues- 4/5: Superb<br />13. Effect and Cause- 3.5/5 Solid<br /><br />Overall, ICKY THUMP is one of 2007's best and I'm sure the 2008 Grammys will showcase that. 4 stars from me.4/5: Not my favorite, but top-rate nonetheless.

B00005JPHT|5.0|Many people are saying that this is Moore's \\"best\\" movie.  I wouldn't disagree.  He has indeed come of age as a documentarian here, and it certainly lacks the polemical polarity of his previous film.<br /><br />I entered the theater knowing, after having seen only a few interview snippets prior to the release, that the film was going to focus on health care.  I actually was expecting at least half the movie to focus on the percentage of citizens who have no insurance.  But the focus of the film is not on those who are uninsured, but rather, those of us who already THINK we're fully covered because we have insurance.<br /><br />Heath Maintenance Organizations (HMO's) are institutions which focus on maximizing profit and minimizing care.  Anytime medical care is given to a patient, this is referred to as a \\"medical loss\\" in the Orwellian doublethink of HMO's.  This crooked system began in the 1970s, when Edgar Kaiser proposed his Permanente plan to Richard Nixon.  This conversation is on tape and it is damning.  Kaiser proposes a new health care system for America.  You hear Nixon say, \\"You know I'm not too keen on this damn government programs.\\"  You hear Kaiser saying, \\"This plan is a private, profit-based plan.  It emphasizes less medical care, more money saved.\\"  Then you hear Nixon clearly saying \\"I like it.\\"  The next day, Nixon went on national TV and proposed Kaiser's Permanente plan, emphasizing that he wanted Americans to have the best health care coverage in the world.  :&lt;<br /><br />My blood boiled when Moore highlighted the HMOs' decisions to deny care to the people Moore exampled, namely, the black guy with cancer (\\"Tracy\\") and the black woman whose daughter was struck with a high fever and went into cardiac arrest.  In both cases, the lives could have easily been saved had care been administered in a timely fashion, as would have been the case in just about any other country.  HMOs' modus operandi is to find ANY technical or bureaucratic excuse to deny care.<br /><br />For me personally, there are two major myths about universal health care that this film destroys:  (1) Any nationalized health service is bottom-of-the-rung and (2) Doctors don't make much money and lead a relatively low standard of living.  Moore's forays to England, Canada and France provide ample evidence that on the whole, citizens in those countries, though they surely bicker and complain about their own system from time to time (human condition), feel fortunate to have nationalized health care and are relieved that they are not caught up in the U.S. system.  If you watch American corporate propaganda like Bill O'Reilly, you can get brainwashed into believing that the U.S. health care system is the best in the world.  In actuality, the U.S. is No. 37, just beating out Slovenia.  :)  Of course, it's true that Cuba is 39, two slots below the U.S., but on that list, France is No. 1, and the UK is No. 18.  Well, given that only two slots separate the U.S. and Cuba, and given all the corporate propaganda we hear about Cuba's system being absolutely terrible... does that not say something about ourselves?<br /><br />As a British-born American, who still has British and hence EU citizenship, I wonder if I'm being stupid for not packing my bags now.  To make it short, I am a violinist in several minor-league orchestras, like the Dayton and West Virginia Symphonies.  Those are considered part-time orchestras, they don't offer any kind of benefits, not enough money to live on, and of course you only get paid when you actually work.  If I moved to Germany tomorrow, and started playing with comparable orchestras over there, I wouldn't have to worry about health care, and I'd get six weeks of paid vacation a year!<br /><br />Anyway, Mr. Moore, great job once again!ally, there are two major myths about universal health care that this film destroys:  (1) Any nationalized health service is bottom-of-the-rung and (2) Doctors don't make much money and lead a relatively low standard of living.

B000002U8G|4.0|Pink Floyd's \\"Meddle\\" is a classic Rock album, not by the worn-out standards of what one might conjure up, as being 'trademark' perhaps 'wrapped in flames' of 'greatness'.  Yet it is because \\"Meddle\\" Breaks the 'standards of greatness' with it's ingenuity and creativity, especially considered within the age and times it was written. Heavy-metal was on the verge of becoming 'King' of Radio, Circuit Concerts, and Album Sales. Groups from Grand Funk Railroad, BloodRock, Atomic Rooster, Led Zepplin, and Artists coming into their own Eric Clapton, Ted Nugent, Alvin Lee, all were producing themselves as Rock Icons, if not Legends because of finding a unique Niche into the Listener's  ever growing list of preferences.  Yet \\"Meddle\\" stands out in its own uniqueness because of several different styles of music being integrated and merged.  The album moves from the Blues 'Shamus' cannine assisted, to the real-life ballards done with amazing diverse instrumentation, and finally progresses into the in-comparable ozone production of Rock-heavy imagery interspersed between layers of electric variations alluring visions of pre-historic travel dodging the Pteradactals through the mist, while being enticed into the sounds of ducks on a foggy pond, and finishes with the crescendo of signature \\"Floyd\\" guitar climax.  \\"Meddle\\" is a compilation of superb creative variations of songs not obviously connected by theme, melody or structure, but there is an un-deniable thread of \\"Floyd\\" DNA which creates this project as one which is very unique even within the repertoire of Pink FLoyd.  It precludes \\"Dark side of moon\\", and \\"Animals\\" with somewhat of a premonition of the greatness there, not by an easily placed clue of song patterns, but by the undercurrent progession genius.  An album which seems to emulate \\"Meddle\\", was \\"Arc of a Diver\\" by Steve Winwood, another genius of diverse progression himself.  Listen to them and see if they arent complimentary.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually is a cunning, interesting, and tear-jerking film about 8 so-so couples flirting with the concept of love in every single way possible. There will be \\"awww\\"s and there will be \\"whoaa\\"s, but in the end, there will be silence. Have you ever actually watched the entirity of the end credits roll? You will now. Not because you want to see the names of the people who portrayed the people who swept you off your feet, but because you will be so far off your feet you can't even reach the remote.     8 different love stories. It's like taking 8 romance movies and condensing them into 2 hours of film. And I know what you're thinking... And it's not sloppy. The writers pause each sub-plot at a minor cliff-hanger and move on to the next one. It's fun, it's charming, it's love. It teaches you about the importance of not letting something (or someone) go without telling them what's in your heart.     So watch it. Follow along with these people, these people in search of love, these people losing love, and these people trying to hold onto it. An actor and actress being filmed in explicit situations with each other exchange conversations as if they were in a coffee shop, each secretely hoping to make their on-screen love a reality. England's rookie Prime Minister falls head-over-heels for his catering secretary, a pleasantly plump, clumsy, cussing woman, so he must decide over his job or his secret. A man and woman who have children, but there's a little note inside their heads saying the marriage is falling apart. Possibly because of the man's secret crush-ish on his secretary. Two co-workers who have been dancing around each other for years, it's all up to who makes the first move. A widow who is coping with the loss of his wife, while his elementary step-son is in love with a schoolmate of his, gives his step-son advice and insight on love, even though it may very well be the father who is learning something. (Next is my personal favorite) A man who moves to France to write after his wife cheats on him, and hires a Portugese maid, while speaking different languages and no understanding of the other, they conjure crushes for each other, and they obviously don't know how the other one feels. A couple has just married, but the man's best friend has been in love with the wife since they've met, this is something many males can relate to. An old rocker who falls back in love with music and attempts to recreate a good relationship with his manager while trying to get the #1 christmas hit. And finally, the good old-fashioned American viewpoint on 'love', a barely-legal man who is desperate for sex moves to America where he hopes to score.     As I said, this film covers ever concept of love, whether condescending or illicit, they're all there. The topics of affairs, office crushes, crush-on-best-friend's-girl, choosing between love and current career, child crushes, love being a universal language, and women being used as sex symbols rather than soulmates are all evident in this film. It does deserve it's 'R' rating so be careful with your children. (Even though it's more fun to watch on a date.)    While some of the mini-love stories are way better and more entertaining than the rest, there is a message in all of them.
B000HIVQD0|5.0|This reissue of The Pretenders' great debut album is a real treat for fans.  Not only has the sound quality been remastered to near perfection, the cardboard packaging is also very well designed and executed with the inclusion of a 16-page booklet that has a great essay on the band with great photos to boot and especially with all the lyrics included as well.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of extra tracks and especially of bonus discs because most of the time they are just filler tracks or even worse, interviews or alternative takes of songs which end up detracting from the main course.  Fortunately, the extra disc here, doesn't fall into that category as most of the tracks are actually very interesting to listen to including a live rock version of Khachutarian's \\"Sabre Dance\\" too which was delightful.<br /><br />What can you say about this album that hasn't already been said though.  Although the cover of the Kinks' \\"Stop Your Sobbing\\" and \\"Brass In Pocket\\" were the major hits, the rest of the tracks aren't album filler either as in any classic album, the cohesion and flow of the tracks in this album seemed to be predestined somehow.  Chrissie Hynde's voice is so distinctive that you know you're listening to a Pretenders' record after the first few bars.  Sadly, half of the band would be dead shortly after this release, just like Def Leppard more recently, the band would rise to the occasion to produce an even better album later on in \\"Learning to Crawl\\".  Still, as far as debuts go, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one with perhaps the exception of Television's debut which is an underrated work of genius and should be among the top 20 albums of all time or maybe Elvis Costello's \\"My Aim is True\\".<br /><br />Good packaging, good sound quality, good price, all spells value for money.  Recommended.
B000005GWH|5.0|Elliot's 1993 album \\"Soul Embrace\\" is my favorite album by saxophonists pop instrumentalist Richard Elliot and looking back on it, it was tough to follow up on that one but he accomplishes that with his 1994 gem entitled \\"After Dark\\". While not quite as strong or consistant as it's predecessor, this CD still features some very strong cuts like \\"As I Sleep\\", the confident and haunting \\"Candlelight\\" to the final atmospheric classic \\"Slow It Down\\". Many years and albums have come and gone since this album came out but both this and \\"Soul Embrace\\" and maybe \\"Chill Factor\\" are the one's that have as of writing this held up over the years. Highly recommended for pop instrumental lovers.

B000LXKLHI|4.0|Although not as consistently great as THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD, SPACE ODDITY is still one of David Bowie's best efforts. The RYKODISC version includes three bonus tracks plus a snippet that was excised from the 1972 album. \\"Don't Sit Down\\"'s reinclusion really adds nothing to this set. The other tracks however, \\"Conversation Piece,\\" and both sides of a 1970 single are quite excellent.<br /><br />I recently listened to this album again, after almost 30 years. The song \\"Cygnet Committee\\" still gives me goosebumps when it reaches its Bolero-like crescendo and Bowie practically screams \\"I want to live\\" over and over. The title track will never get tiring for me, nor will \\"An Occasional Dream\\" or \\"Memory of a Free Festival.\\" This one is definitely worth owning, and for Bowie fans, essential.<br /><br />(Points off for an unreadable lyric sheet-- although I did like the photos on it.)<br /><br />PROGRAM LIST<br />(5:14) Space Oddity<br />(6:10) Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed<br />(0:39) Don't Sit Down<br />(2:30) Letter To Hermione<br />(9:30) Cygnet Committee<br />(3:19) Janine<br />(2:56) An Occasional Dream<br />(4:47) Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud<br />(3:16) God Knows I'm Good<br />(7:07) Memory of a Free Festival<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS:<br />(3:05) Conversation Piece (1970 'B' side of \\"Prettiest Star\\")<br />(3:59) Memory of a Free Festival Part 1  **<br />(3:31) Memory of a Free Festival Part 2  **<br /><br />** 1970 single version.

B00005JCAA|5.0|I saw \\"Meet Joe Black\\" (MJB) in a theater when it first came out. At the time, I thought it was okay, but nothing great. I just saw it again on DVD and now love it. Here are the reasons why:<br /><br />*For me, the main fascination of MJB is its underlying premise--what can happen when a noncorporal spirit being, the powerful Angel of Death, \\"takes a holiday\\" by assuming bodily form. It means that this spirit now experiences all the sensual pleasures and pains that flesh is heir to. He tastes food and develops a fondness for peanut butter; he sees and appreciates beauty in the form of Susan (Claire Forlani); he falls in love and is overcome by its ecstacies as well as its pains. He's also a quick learner in the lesson of being human, rapidly graduating in a few days to the pinnacle of what is best in humanity--our ability to transcend our selfishness for the good of another. In portraying this demanding role, I thought Brad Pitt did eminently well, especially in conveying with his eyes the immense power of the Angel of Death.<br /><br />*Anthony Hopkins' superb acting: He gives us such nuances of expression, imbuing his Bill Parrish with great feeling and believability. Wannabe actors should watch and learn from his performance, which was a master class in acting.<br /><br />*The movie's affirmation of life: At the end, watching the glorious fireworks and knowing that his death is imminent, Hopkins remarked to Joe Black that it's hard to tear oneself away (from life). If that doesn't move you, nothing will.<br /><br />*The movie's moral core: Unlike so many Hollywood flicks these days, MJB takes a moral and supernatural stance--that business can and should be ethical; that it's good that men would want to take care of the women they love; that love means responsibility, wanting what's good for the beloved, and self-sacrifice; and that those who have lived a morally good life have nothing to fear about death.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Confusing? Depressing? This movie isn't for a small child who would be confused by fast-moving plots (this one hardly moves that fast anyway) or for people who believe every human is inherently good and will remain so even in a crisis.     Does this movie overbaringly push a politcal agenda? Perhaps. Yet this film, like all movies, only has the meaning that the viewer perceives. What I took from this film was how ugly the world really is, and how people will not stay civil when it all hits the fan. Is that depressing? It certainly is, but that's the world we live in.     The movie is not without hope. The main character has succumbed to the bleakness of the world's current situation, but is given a new reason to fight on and persevere. The last scene were Theo and the girl are decending the stairs is breathtaking.    Nowadays, it's hard to escape any form of entertainment with a political agenda, either real or perceived. But take from this movie something else.     For those who thought this movie was too depressing, OPEN YOUR EYES. Watch and read the news. I'm not talking about the big things like war and famine around the world. I mean the the small events that take place in your own country. The violent crimes, the senseless fighting, the loss of life. It's everywere, and unfortunately, it's human nature.    The movie itself is amazing. The cinematography is breathtaking. It was compared to Saving Private Ryan and rightly so. The first action scene in the car and the last chase through the \\"fugee\\" camp is done with one camera and in continuous action. This really captivates the veiwer and makes him feel like he's actually in the scene. Great sound and even better in HD-DVD.     This film has it all: action, drama, comedy, everything for every taste. See it for yourself and take from it what suits you best. But don't be so narrow and watch it only with political eyes. Go deeper than this, and find what its really about.
080010367X|5.0|Are you kidding?!  MIB is the best fantasy/sci fi/action/comedy movie to come along in a very long time.  If you must know, this is my SECOND purchase of the VHS copy of this movie -- I wore the other one out (Yes, it is that good).

B0000047EC|5.0|An intimate, sometimes haunting, always soothing compilation of melodious tracks by two masters. The focus is introspective yet sophisticated; it is a subtle, lyrical synthesis of dreamy acoustic guitar and bass.<br /><br />Haden's bass lines twine and insinuate through the familiar Metheny guitar work; this is real mellow winding-down music, better than evening cocktails.<br /><br />These tracks are only vaguely jazz-like; really, this music is genre transcending. Great stuff as background music to read or write by. If only more of reality was this smooth . . .<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts
B00005JPFF|4.0|As a big Spiderman fan, I eagerly anticipated this third Spidey blockbuster living up to its billing. It didn't disappoint. Not totally.  There is a lot going on in this one. Spidey faces off against two of his most powerful foes, and one of his friends.   The themes in Spiderman 3 are darker. Peter tangles with a side of himself that seems so out of character, it's actually very funny, at times, but well acted by Tobey Maguire. Then, he must deal with the growing pains of his relationship with Mary Jane,(Kirsten Dunst), who has her own issues.  My favorite parts of the whole movie were the fight scenes, and the birth of the Sandman. The graphics were awesome, as usual.   This was a great movie, but I got the feeling that because there was so much going on, some of the plot couldn't be fully fleshed out, yet I think the producers had to go big on this one, because of the enormous legacy  of the other two. I really enjoyed it, and went to watch it twice in the theaters.
B000A0GYD2|4.0|However, I think this would have been more enjoyable without a bias towards the Americans which kinda makes it like a russia vs the US battle, which I suppose is really what pushed the Americans to achieve this feat to begin with.  Anyway, it's really inspiring and just amazing to watch this dvd and realise how the space program progressed and brought tons of technological advances. NASA should plan a mission to mars soon.. or another manned mission to the moon.
1416911049|5.0|Cinematic in its storytelling, UGLIES truly delivers a YA futuristic action tale that engages the reader right from the start. Longer than the typical YA novel, UGLIES does not disappoint in its ability to keep the reader involved.     It's not perfect, as some descriptions of places and actions are a bit confusing and tend to make the reader have to re-read a section to understand the picture that the author is trying to create. But with so much happening, that minor problem is acceptable.     As for the story itself, it's a real page-turner! Starting with a unique concept of a future where all sixteen-year-olds have an operation to turn them drop-dead gorgeous, once established, this concept really makes a reader contemplate the wisdom of such a place -- racism and preferential treatment (based on beauty) no longer exists as there is a level playing field for everyone. Sounds promising...except when more information comes out -- deep into the story, where it can have the deepest impact. As a teacher, I imagine that my students would love to discuss the ramifications of living in such a society.     Plotwise, UGLIES really moves and feels very much like a summer blockbuster at the movies with hoverboards, burned out cities, bungee jackets and some great quests to engage young minds who need ACTION! Character conflicts also become engaging with questions of loyalty, inner beauty, good vs.evil, and teen independence motivating the progression of plot.     I wish I had time right now to immediately pick up the next two books in this trilogy because I get a sense that there's more of the same in books 2 and 3.     I highly recommend this book for teen readers who want thrills on the page!

Rather, this is a long discourse on his interesting theory but not a beach-read.  I was disappointed but that's probably because I expected another \\"Tipping Point\\" type of book.
0060763892|5.0|Rollins always gives you excitement - and The Judas Strain is no exception - This time the Sigma Force is off to find why there are outbreaks of plague-like symptoms at the Christmas Islands - Monk and Lisa, posing as WHO members, are onboard a luxury liner converted into a floating hospital/research lab. The liner is suddenly attacked by pirates and Guild members and there is an assault that can jeopardize the work. On the other side of the world, Gray meets Seichan, beautiful Guild member and somtime nemisis, near his parents' house - she has an ancient obelisk that she says will save the world. When Guild members come in to retrieve the ancient object, Gray and Seichan start on a trek to see what the message in the stone says - it deals with Marco Polo and his trip home and the mystery of the way he returned - a couple of ships and few men - he wrote a true account of what happened to them and it seems this plague-like occurrance happened to Polo's party, and may have a possible cure. But Gray and co. must go on a quest for pieces of the puzzle that will show where this cure is, if it indeed exists. As usual, Rollins takes us around the world - Rome, Istanbul (I call it Constantinople) and Cambodia. He gives us the history of Marco Polo and the history of how Aghia Sophia, once a marvel of Christianity, was converted to a mosque then to a museum. The script on the clues seems to be in a language that predates known language and well may be the 'language of angels' - the means to communicate with angels -<br />The action is non-stop. I thought the book might have been about 50 pages too long, just prolonging the actions on the cruise ship, but it all works and it is another winner for Sigma Force. The next installment will be very important to me because it is a cliffhanger for one of my favorite Sigma Force folks.<br />Again, this is a non-stop read, with humor, horror, adventure, history and all points in between -
B0000AM6K2|5.0|A great album from start to finish.  It is my third album of his, and they are all among my favorites.
0895260131|5.0|Great book.  The first part looks at most of the major myths that exist about Islam - from its supposed invention of the number system to its alleged tolerance, particularly in Andaluzia (Spain).  The latter part dealt with the crusades, and what really ignited them.  I haven't seen a better account of the crusades ever, even in encyclopedias that addressed the subject at some lengths (try finding out about the Second Crusade in other material).  The book also analyzes what Europe's history would have been like had the crusades never happened, as well as some of the things that Crusaders were required to do - that we would as well - before going on their crusade.    Note: one doesn't need to be a Christian to appreciate this book.  A Muslim isn't likely to like it, given the uncomfortable truths that the book lays bare about Islam.
B000OY8NII|4.0|Okay, I've read the other reviews and see that what is missing here is a reality check, folks. Eureka is a fun television show. Period. The premise is wacky, as are some of the characters, which makes it all a great hour to spend watching television. I'm not sure the network started out to reinvent \\"Star Trek\\" (I'm sure not) but merely set out to entertain us, the viewing audience. I, for one, was entertained by this show and intend on TiVo-ing the second season so I don't miss an episode. I happen to like the premise and the commaraderie between the characters. What it boils down to, folks, is that we are all entitled to our own opinion and I, for one, encourage you to take a chance on \\"Eureka\\" and form your own opinion! After all, this was only the first season, and if I remember correctly, \\"Star Trek\\" wasn't so great that first season, either, as is the case with most great shows.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|This is another movie that tenuously links different lives in different parts of the world (Morocco, Japan, United States and Mexico).    Hollywood and the mainstreem media seem to have overlooked the contributions by the actors who play the two Moroccan brothers,their father and the Moroccan locals.  Acting achievements of Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt, though significant, really should take a back seat to the \\"secondary actors\\" which also includes Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi, the Mexican nanny, and the two American kids.

B000Q67DEO|4.0|No complaints about anything but the beginnings of each video being covered by graphics from the original release, from which the title song suffers most. (The complete video for the song \\"Eat To The Beat\\" can be found on the PINK LADY Variety Show Box Set from Rhino, as well as the complete video for \\"Shayla\\"). Otherwise, this collection is great and looks FAB  and is a must for every Blondie collector. Best vids are \\"Dreaming\\", \\":Shayla\\" and \\"The Hardest Part\\"--which, along with \\"Hangin on the Telephone\\",  just may be the best Blondie video ever.

B000PTYP5C|4.0|After listening to this album, I breathed a huge sigh of relief that Dream Theater was back on track. I didn't care much for the last studio release, Octavarium, mainly because I thought the songs had too much of a pop leaning. That said, I respect serious muscians that take chances and do different things on each album because it makes their overall catalogue more interesting in the long run.     In my book, Images and Words to be a five star album so with that in mind, I think that Systematic Chaos falls somewhere behind it. It has all the elements of a classic Dream Theater album: long elaborate arrangements, timely subject matters, virtuoso performances from all the members, and of course, heavy guitars. However, the album shows that the band continues to grow by using some of the ligher shades that were present on Octavarium and combining them with the heaviness of Train of Thought and the long arrangements on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.    If you've never heard Dream Theater before this wouldn't be a bad release to start with; however, I would recommend buying the regular album rather than the deluxe release. My favorite part of the deluxe release is the 5.1 mix but the music is excellent no matter what mix you are listening to so if this your first DT album save the cash and buy the regualr release. For the rest of us, the hardcore DT fans, the bonus release is a must.
1594489505|2.0|1.)I have tried numerous times to start this book but feel immediately  overwhelmed. Broadening my knowledge of Afghanistan and her people is why the book was purchased. It is not drawing me in as I had hoped.  2.) a great read on a long summer journey. I couldn't get enough of the plight of the people. I was compelled to read Kite Runner as well. Great stuff.
1400063515|4.0|For years engineering had the theoretical tools to make metal fly, fly higher, faster, further. But keeping it up in the air until ready to come down was hit and miss. The math of turbulence and failure was simply impossible. So crash tests, scale models and gross whacking in as many ways as conjecture could bring forth was the means to the durability that was hoped for. Even so, planes burst apart, popped into flames, spun topsy turvey when the inexplicible happened. Who knew? Who could have guessed that seven minor things would all line up at once to bring a good design down?    But when you consider the repetition of exposure... millions? How could there NOT be such an alignment eventually? Maybe there are more, more than millions of improbable combinations just lurking there, waiting for nothing more than an improbable but someway inevitable coming together of one of them.    We now embrace this, this chaos math, as the bed rock of the new physics, engineering, weather forcasting and so much more. But unless you have a firm grip on at least 30 decimal places of absolute certainty, fed by a steady stream of reliable data, it won't help.    Anybody have those? The Black Swan is a metaphor, a visual and compelling metaphor for this unsettling reality. Good ideas don't always work. And, bad ideas don't always fail. Good people can do badly and fools can do well. And have. Often. But don't follow them. As they say, \\"It's better to be lucky than good.\\" But luck doesn't last.    -----------  Style: The author stirs in his own interesting past and has no problem popping the balloons of others. Did I count 4 Nobel prize winners given the Bronx cheer? So take some chaos theory minus the actual math, add some World Wrestling Federation jaw boning and you have the book. Some don't like the negative expostulations. But, I, for one, would like to see the cage match. Watch out, he's got a folding chair!
0751532711|1.0|This is an absolutely awful book. It is amazing, and not a little sobering, that Kiyosaki's book which champions some of the worst traits in human nature, should be so popular.<br /><br />Kiyosaki worships greed, meanness, cunning, shrewdness and lack of compassion. It really is difficult to see how this man could say ANYTHING of value. His real dad may have been poor, but his real failure was in failing to teaching K. to be a full human being capable of intimacy and love. Instead what we see is a pushy and insecure consumer boasting of his Lamborghini's and Rolex's but unable to relate to other humans with decency and respect (unless they are rich). Seriously, how much more pathetic can one get?<br /><br />This is, basically, a book for losers. W

B000MR9D5E|5.0|i thought it was great on the discovery channel but is does not compare to watching in on HD. it is like the animals leap our at you! i just don't know how they do it. the BBC cinametographer, producers, directors and art director know the secret sauce (i hate saying that).     the discover channel misses a lot of the behind the scenes which is very impressive. i love to see the how they made it kind of documentation. the imagery is beautiful, the narration is spectacular and th accuracy is amazing. the photo director should win an oscar (or emmy). it is very similar to the \\"blue planet\\" which was also well worth the money. i can watch it over and over again. i would highly recommend this series for anyone over the age of 10. it odes get quite graphic when it comes to the animals feeding. bravo BBC another great!
B000P2A24W|4.0|I have been a fan of Bon Jovi since before Slippery came out. Saw them on the Slippery tour. Have bought every album since, with diminishing enthusiasm. I love 70's classic rock. So what was I to make of this so-called \\"Country\\" album ?    I hate country music and I pretty much hate \\"Have a Nice Day\\", \\"Crush\\" and most of \\"Bounce\\", not because Bon Jovi lost their talent, but the direction was all wrong and seeminly manufactured. The decline started with \\"It's My Life\\" in my book - just a concocted slab of trying to be hip.    The box set on the other hand was fabulous, full of little gems of songwriting genius that still proved the band had it. I had to scratch my head and wonder why so many of the great recent songs on the box set had not made the recent studio albums.    Well, I plugged the CD into the car stereo, not really expecting much other than to be massively disapointed. But hey ! What a great opener, Lost Highway is classic Bon Jovi, by which I don't mean late-80's rock, it's just good time, good message, great vibe, rock'n'roll !     After that, each and every song on the album was for the most part, enjoyable and not a single country song in sight.    My god, what a relief. This album is NOT COUNTRY.     I love the album \\"Blaze of Glory\\" and don't recall anybody describing that as a country album. This is, in some ways, a similar style of music. It's americana if you like, but certainly not country, twangy and depressing.    It's definitely not Slippery When Wet, but when was the last time you listened to that album anyway ? It's a great album for today, and I believe truely reflects everything good about this band, without rehashing old ideas, or trying to be the latest trend. This is real music, and really good music.    Not quite a 5-star effort, but miles better than I had hoped for.    Recommended. Best since \\"These Days\\" !!
B000M5AJQS|1.0|My wife and I purchased this movie with the expectation that it would be a great movie, a fun couple of hours. It was not. It was simply boring and tiresome. We have all come to expect a great deal from Scorsese. While these expectations are high and maybe unfair, they are fairly earned as Scorsese has provided great movie after great movie. With that in mind, one can safely say this was a letdown of epic proportions. It was a just a rehash of Scorsese's previous movies with a helping of \\"southie\\" accent thrown on top. It was slow and boring. Skip this one, unless you have a few hours and a couple of bucks to kill. Sorry, but it was this bad. Honest!!!!
1594489505|3.0|I was anticipating reading A Thousand Spelndid Suns after I recently finished the Kite Runner.  Many of the reviews touted this book as even better than KR.  I do not agree.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that this book was written in the third person and we were able to see both the main caharcters points of views and internal monologues, but because of this, I feel it lacked the emotional potency of Hosseini's first novel.  I wasn't swept away by the story.  I didn't have an emotional investment in the characters.  It was a decent read, nonetheless, but the Kite Runner will always be on my top 10 list.
1400097029|3.0|Literate sentences blossom from these pages like crocuses in the spring. But too early - there was a blizzard and they all died. In this dour Irish novel, it seems, everyone is dying or guilty or ugly or useless or stupid or flawed... Yes, yes, the prose are dazzling! But, aaaa - so much pain... The surprise (at least to me) little bit of closure that snuck in at the end of the story was not sufficient to make all that came before it worthwhile.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has become one of the longer-lived and most well-established metal bands, but because of their evolving style the most consistent element of their CDs is that they piss off a sizeable portion of their fans.  Undertow was too heavy, Aenima was too fast, Lateralus was too progressive and 10,000 Days is too mellow.    Tool fans are known as some of the most rabid, die-hard fans in the music industry, not just just because of their loyalty but because of their enthusiasm: spending an hour in a Tool mosh pit is like spending six hours in a Slayer or Pantera pit (I know this from personal experience, and I was a Slayer fan before I even heard of Tool).  It is then natural to expect some outcry at each CD release because some fans will always expect more of the same.  Tool just isn't that band.    Most fans eventually seem to take a liking to each new CD after a few months of listening (or at least stop bitching about it) because Tool works on each CD until it is perfected.  The style or sound of Tool may not be what some people like, but the CD is still a masterpiece.  This is not to say that Tool CDs are a \\"Learn to Love\\" sound; they are not.  It is just impossible to predict what the next Tool album is going to be like, and the new sound always shocks some people.  Despite this it is almost unheard of for someone to renounce their fanship.    10,000 Days represents the 5th sound from Tool, and is in many ways the most demanding of its listeners.  Tool is, if nothing else, heavy, therefore the most shocking aspect of 10,000 Days is that it has, at least at first glance, a lighter sound.  Realistically the CD has plenty of drop D power cords, massive distortion and beats all characteristic of heavy bands (with, of course, the intricacy and complex composition/timing obligatory to all Tool music), but the album also has another form of heaviness, which is the juxtoposition of lighter rhythms with the heavier rhythms.  This is more demanding to the listener because someone who is expecting an album containing the same songs as previous albums may ignore the lighter side of the CD.  In effect many listeners only heard half the CD on the first try.    This juxtoposition of lighter and heavier styles is most reminiscent of A Perfect Circle's first album (obviously not a coincidence), however Tool has certainly perfected it and created an album that truly redefines what heaviness is about.    The lyrics of Tool have always been enigmatic, if not stygian, and controversial, but 10,000 Days was more shocking to Tool's fans than the rest of society.  The title cut almost seems an acceptance of judeo-christian religions, which would be shocking, if not outright betrayal, to the fanbase.  Knowledge of the story behind the song quickly alleviates that idea.    Tools music is certainly worthy of 5 stars (or more) by itself, but this is a CD that truly deserves more than 5 stars.  Like other Tool albums buying the CD gets you more than music, it is also art.  Tool's latest installment contains a serious of 3D images of the typical Tool style.  To be clear, these are not the cheesy red and blue captain EO 3D; they are very high quality and immersive works.  Going back to the music, the album is around 77 minutes long, even taking out the few filler type tracks the album contains as much music as other bands release on 2 CDs.  The CD also sold for 12.99 USD on debut, far cheaper than many bands that spend less than half as much time on their music.    To recap: You get more music, that's higher quality as well as amazing artwork for much less than most other CDs.  Even non-Tool fans should be able to respect a band that really goes above and beyond the standard.    There is much speculation that 10,000 Days may be the penultimate (or perhaps last) Tool album, but if Tools record is any indication one thing is certain: as long as Tool keeps playing, we'll keep listening.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Wonderful DVD/CD chronicling major historic blues artists - one of a kind album - a 'must have' for the blues enthusiast.  Highly recommend!
B00003CXDD|5.0|If you grew up in the 80s and didn't see this movie, then where the heck were you?? This is a must see movie and falls into the category of a  timeless, well loved classic that never expires. We never tire from watching \\"Willow\\". Infact, we named one of our daughters \\"Alora\\" after Ellora Dannon. \\"Willow\\" is a true family film, filled with adventure, action, humor, romance and magic! It's got everything in it and will bring out the child in everyone. And if you're an 80s Junkie like me (or not), it will probably already be in your DVD library (or pretty soon may well be) that you can pull out again and again to enjoy. You won't regret investing in this wonderful spell of entertainment.
B000002H1T|5.0|The fifth studio release by the Cars' is Heartbeat City a CD filled with infectious songs and one that elevated the band to a new found glory thanks to some sharp, fun, intellectual, goofy and, most importantly, creative videos in the height of MTV's importance in pop culture.    This album spread the Cars' appeal to a new audience but it also came with a degree of spoil, perhaps putting the band in an unwanted position of notoriety one which was difficult to uphold for future releases.    The CD was produced by famed producer Mutt Lange and it exposed the use, maybe overuse, of a drum machine by drummer David Robinson; however, the Cars pulled off the trick of satisfying long time fans while developing a larger audience through catchy pop tracks.    A track-by-track review:    1. The CD starts off with \\"Hello Again\\" a track probably more famous for its extensive video presence with the likes of Andy Warhol and a group of purposely used freaky people.  Ric Ocasek does lead vocals.  The song is one of the album's best and was representative of the imagery of the time.  It holds up today.    2. \\"Looking for Love\\" is an overlooked tune.  While it isn't the pop sensation of others on the disc, it is a song that deserves merit for if nothing else Ocasek's unique vocal style.    3. \\"Magic\\" is another tune that congers up images of the video played many times on MTV.  Ocasek walks on water and a gang of misfits fawn over his presence.  The song instantly induces memories of summertime pleasures.    4. \\"Drive\\" is perhaps the signature vocal of Benjamin Orr.  The man never got his due as one of rock's all-time great vocalists.  Here is a perfect illustration of a phenomenal voice and a chilling reminder of a lost treasure.  True fans will never forget him.  The video starred Ocasek's future wife, model Paulina Porizkova, and highlighted the typical ups and downs of a relationship.  Paulina's sexiness is ideal.     5. \\"Stranger Eyes\\" is another song that merits better appreciation than what history has written.  Orr delivers the vocals and the song is a winner.    6. \\"You Might Think\\" is in a group of songs that defines the music of the new wave era of the 1980s.  The video, an award-winner, is comical and shows the mystery that is Ocasek in an extroverted way.  One of the band's all-time best songs.  \\"You might think I'm crazy but all I want is you.\\"  What an obvious line but what a splendid one, too.  Brevity is the soul of wit.    7. \\"It's Not the Night\\" is arguably the big rocker on this release.  Orr again shows his vocals have no limitations.  He evokes memories of \\"Cruiser\\" from Shake it Up.  Crank this up.    8. \\"Why Can't I Have You\\" was a deep album cut at the time.  It is melancholy and the cries of desperation in Ric's voice can be heard throughout.  In one sense a soft song but in another so powerful.    9. \\"I Refuse\\" wallows in mediocrity but it does have some attraction.  Ocasek does a good job here painting a picture of someone who is tired of being used by his mate and who refuses to be part of any charade.    10. \\"Heartbeat City\\" is the title track and is a cool, if not smashing, entry.  It is a tune that will create an image of how one person can make another smile with just her (Jacki) presence.  A really solid song.  This is one of those tracks that never gets tired.
B000QFCD2W|5.0|Another splendid musical horror novel from King Diamond, the little girl in the bloody dress comes through the mirror, uncertain about her state of being... the introductory song \\"Dead\\" is laden with mood-setting organ, haunting voices explaining the basics of the disturbing plot, dealing with a little brother and sister who were murdered by their father, but are scheduled for different destinations \\"after death\\" - it is up to her to save him from Hell, after being accused by \\"the powers that be\\" of suicide. She reveals the true circumstances of their demise - to set the terms \\"right\\" so they may 'rest in peace' together, presumably in \\"Heaven\\", although 'demons' pine for both their 'souls' in this supernatural adventure / thriller concept album.<br /><br />The album features the spectral voice of Livia Zita, whom you may recognize from 'The Puppet Master' as well, adding an enchanting compliment to the music as well as storyline. Besides the intricate Metal instrumentation, cellos and the harpsichord are included, adding an eerie feel to the brilliant orchestration.<br /><br />Of particular note, My personal favorites herein are \\"Dead\\" {the 'gothic' horror instrumental}, \\"Give Me Your Soul\\" {really displays the talent and skill of the band}, \\"Shapes of Black\\" {great beat and harmony; one can actually relate to these occurrences, environment, and denizens}, \\"Cold As Ice\\" {the cold temperature in the dark room even in remmus}, \\"Girl In The Bloody Dress\\" {the rhythms and correlations of voices}, and \\"Moving On\\" {the hypnotically-melancholy quality and voice combinations} .<br /><br />The aesthetics are predictably wonderfully ornate, of course featuring the band, and one Magic, King's black cat familiar, perceiving the ghost as familiars are said to sense. It was also gratifying to see the band dressed in black robes within, each signalling the Cornu, adding a most evocatively mystical impression. King promises a Hell of a show to accompany this chapter as well, repleat with horror psychodrama.<br /><br />Overall, 'Give Me Your Soul... Please' is definitely one of King's best.ma.    Overall, 'Give Me Your Soul... Please' is definitely one of King's best.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I like to consider myself a big movie buff. One of my personal favorite films from this decade is \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\". I am not a Jim Carrey but the premise of the film still intrigued me.<br /><br />Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet plays a dysfunctional couple named Joel and Clementine. The couple are polar opposites from one another. Joel is more quiet and reserved while Clementine is more gregarious and unpredictable. These personality differences makes their relationship far from dull. After having a huge blow out with Joel, Clementine decides to have her memories of Joel erased courtesy of Howard (Tom Wilkinson) and his assistants played by Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Woods. When Joel finds out about what Clementine did, he decides to get the same procedure done on him. During the process of having his memories of Clementine erased (which is basically a lobotomy), Joel relizes that he still loves Clementine and does not want to forget her.<br /><br />I loved this film right from the first time I saw this film in the theatre but I really didn't get it until I viewed it a few more times on dvd. The way the film is edited is a bit confusing but the more I have watched it, the more the film makes sense. What I saw was a history of Joel and Clementine's rocky relationship. The performances was great. It was nice to see Jim Carrey actually tone down his comedic schtick and Kate Winslet take on a more comedic role. The writing and directingis just as good. Too bad most films in the past two years haven't come close to the uniqueness of \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\".
1569242739|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to make delicious vegan cup cakes for my 2 year olds party without putting off the non vegan children and their parents. I made the basic chocolate and basic vanilla cupcakes, with chocolate and vanilla buttercream frosting.... I had twice as many cupcakes as guests, and no cupcakes were left over! Best cupcakes I've ever had, ans my guests felt the same!  I made the margarita cupcakes for my coworkers the other day, and they kept asking \\"are these really vegan?\\"  This book makes every other cake recipe I own obsolete.
B000P2A256|5.0|I love having a \\"little secret band\\" -- the garage band with a small following or something like that -- but Maroon 5 is definitely not that anymore.  Normally I hate when songs go single and are blasted all over the airways (Beyonce's \\"Irreplaceble\\" a prime example -- I loved that song until I heard it every other minute), but I've even set \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" as my ringtone and I'm STILL not tired of it.  I love that song, along with just about every song on the CD.    If you want something Songs About Jane-esque, I wouldn't advise this CD.  This one is a bit edgier, and there's nothing really romantic about this CD (their only contemporary song that is is \\"Infatuation,\\" but it's left off the CD and I had to get it elsewhere.)  It's a nice mix of slower, smoother tracks and really upbeat rock-soul tracks.  This CD just solidified my love for Maroon 5, and anyone with an eclectic taste in music should be satisfied with it, too.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I had to watch this movie again before making any comments. This time in my home theater and I must say,size does make a difference. This is a \\"Hollywood\\" movie for sure! I usually don't care for some of these kinds of films as they seem to get a little tedious, but this film is very engrossing and filled with great action. Crowe proves himself to be one of the finest actors today. I'm a big fan of Richard Harris after his Oscar worthy performance in Wrestling Ernest Hemingway and he adds credibility to this picture. The DVD transfer is great and the extras on the single disc edition are good.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a LONG time. What made it so great was that there was no love story (well, not a long drawn out one anyway). Love stories always ruin these kinds of movies. The actors were awesome, the killing scenes were awesome, and the BOOM was awesome. Will watch it again and again!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I loved this picture. There is nothing about it that I would change. The extended version is the best. It brings certain characters full circle. I know it's not a factual account but I enjoyed the story line. I like the fact that Balian rose to the occasion and became the man his father knew he could be. This version I enjoyed the most, it gave more back ground on Balian and his father. I have the original version and then I bought this one. I'm glad I did. I've already seen it countless times because I enjoy Orlando's movies so much. It makes me wonder how much he is like the characters he plays. Balian, knight; defender of Jerusalem, setting off the feeling you can do anything. For him, I think I would.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Esta es la pelicula por excelencia de ciencia ficcion, cambio la forma como se presentaba este tipo de genero. Excelente producto.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|I was surprised at the quality of such a hard comic to interpret into film. The actors all had a lot of fun turning this story into a big screen film event. They all did a wonderful job portraying the charactors as closely as is possible. The original legend has been interpretted differently for the film but was executed very well for the amount of time allotted to tell this story on film. The special effects and stunt work are executed just fine. A few on the edge of your seat moments and chearing for the main charactors was really unexspected but greatly appreciated. I can't wait for the sequile. There could be great things ahead for this anticipated series. When both the older and the new ghost riders are together burning up the trail you can't help but jump up and chear for them, at home of course. Anyone will like it, if they don't their being too picky. Yeah of course the comic is different in comparison to some extent. Just have some fun and watch. The product was shipped out and received on time.
B00008PC2O|5.0|La pelicula es una de las mejores de la serie, el empaque y la presentacion son fabulosas, solo le faltaria que el 2do. DVD traiga subtitulos en español.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|You won't regret purchasing this DVD of Cosi Fan Tutte. It ranks with the very best Cosi on DVD, the Gardiner with Amanda Roocroft, Rosa Mannion, Rodney Gilfry, Rainer Trost, Eirian James from Deutsche Grammophon.  I didn't think that one could be matched but this one does it. Indeed, the acting is even slightly better.
B000OVLBF8|1.0|This movie is a joke.  It's lame, silly and overacted.  This should say it all.... I went with a group of people who work for a comic book store and they all hated it and thought it was a big joke.  They usually like any adaptation!  WORST MOVIE THIS YEAR!!!!
B000P2A24W|5.0|Taking my son to a Bon Jovi concert about 18 years ago, I was tagging along for his sake, but was surprised when I liked the band. Have followed their career but this is the first CD of theirs that I have bought for myself and it is top notch! The duet with Rimes is sure to win lots of awards and can't listen to this CD enough! Bon Jovi still rocks and looks better than ever!
0743277457|5.0|I say this book is highly provocative.... of big question thinking.  Josh's personal experiences from the age of 6 becoming an international chess champion and later becoming an international Tai Chi champion after only 2 years of instruction and training raise all sorts of questions.. and give hints... about the nature of reality, human potential, and so on.  Definitively a book to devour, if you are interested in \\"healing\\", \\"human potential\\" and such.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have been a big James Bond fan for a long time. At the beginning I wasn't sure what to expect from this Daniel Craig guy, but I was amazed after watching the movie! I came back to watch it twice more within 2 weeks. Bond has never been so cool before...
B000021XS0|5.0|along with top notch musical writing, this ia a concept album if there ever was one.  the whole album revolves around specificlly writen melodies along with its consistant story line which involes the double murder of a young couple.  anyone who appreciates concept albyms will see this as being the ultimate one of the genre because it is both melodically and lyrically perfect.  praise be to the best
B00004Y5A8|5.0|If you're a bowie fan, you're in for a treat. I first heard tracks from this album while I was sitting in a coffee shop. I thought he'd done some new live acoustic recordings, they sounded so fresh. There are a lot of tracks and some clunkers, but the good ones make up for it. Bowie is of course and incredible performer and the necessity of these stripped down BBC recordings lets his performances shine. He rips into the songs in a way that's not possible on a studio album. Magical!!
1594489505|3.0|You know, I loved The Kite Runner. And I've read a lot of nonfiction pieces that describe what Hosseini wants to bring to light with this story. While the beginning starts off with powerful imagery and a tone that digs and scorns, the characters fail to grow with their experiences and sadly, they become one-dimensional and distant. The story begins big, but wanes and fades.     I suspect that the editors were too much in a hurry to get this one out. The resulting publicity, too, eclipses the quiet power of what could have been and why Hosseini's writing is cherished.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|It seems like an impossible feat. That one person could produce work of such consistent genius. Surfjan seems to have a supernatural songwriting gift. When I first listened to this album I sat in shock as the John Wayne Gasey Jr. track started playing (I hadn't looked at the track listing). Here is a song about a serial killer that, far from leaving the listener wallowing in hatred or revulsion leaves us with a new and completely astounding insight. I won't give it away. If the album consisted of just that one song I would recommend it. But, of course, it has many songs, and it is a wonderful achievement. Some of the material seems to take an odd direction, but it works into the whole. I also have a suspicion that there are many musical references that I'm not catching.<br /><br />Highly recommended. (If you have a record player, get the vinyl. It's stunning.)
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I heard the \\"what I've Done\\" on the radio and went out and bought the album--I had been waiting like the others on this site for them to release one for what felt like forever....NOT the stuff I expected.  Almost FELL ASLEEP driving listening to the other songs on the CD.  Buy the single, not the album.
B000O78KW4|4.0|When I first saw this movie I was a teenager.  I liked it.  Even today, I still like it.  I know some people consider it inferior to the earlier Die Hard flicks, but in my opinion it's at least better than the second one, which is a complete carbon copy of the first--except it's set in a DC airport instead of an LA high rise.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is no where near believable.  It's over the top in about every way possible.  A European madman wages war on New York City and Bruce Willis while at the same time trying to pull off the biggest heist of all time.  And just for fun he targets Samuel L. Jackson, too, an innocent shopkeeper from Harlem.  There are tons of racial stereotypes and plenty of the normal action film/buddy cop stuff going on, but the movie gets points for one thing--it's never cheesy and there aren't any large, gaping holes in the plot.  There may be scenes where you say \\"that could never happen,\\" and Bruce Willis is apparently more resilient than Super Man, but at least the movie never bogs down with a forced love story or artsy camera angles.<br /><br />This movie is complete, mindless entertainment, but if you know and accept that going in to it, then you'll have to admit that it's at the top of it's genre--even if that genre isn't going to be winning any Academy Awards.
0195170776|5.0|The New Oxford American Dictionary (NOAD) is the best 1-volume English dictionary available.   I will compare this dictionary to the American Heritage Dictionary (2006) as these two dictionaries are the best 1-volume English dictionaries available.     In my opinion, the NOAD is clearly a better dictionary for reasons listed below.  Generally, the NOAD's entries are longer and more detailed, hence the reader gets more information.  The American Heritage definitions are almost too concise (usually too concise for my preference) although many people may prefer the shorter definitions.  Each dictionary will have a number of lesser know words (and even some more common words) the other dictionary will not have (especially scientific words, geographical locations, and newer words), so one dictionary is not superior as far as having a significant amount of more entries.  It appears to me the NOAD has more entries, but even if it doesn't, it is still a better dictionary.      Some comparisons of American Heritage Dictionary (2006) to the NOAD (New Oxford American Dictionary)(2004)     -The NOAD is 1,959 pages A to Z, while The American Heritage 2,006 pages long A to Z.  The American Heritage does not list anywhere that I can see how many entries it has.  The NOAD says it has over 250,000 entries.  The font of the American Heritage is smaller but it is just as easy to read as the NOAD's font.  The NOAD uses 3 columns per page, the American Heritage uses 2.      -The American Heritage has some newer words not found in NOAD, such as Red state, Blue state, Sudoku, Texas hold'em, but don't get the idea though this makes it better than the NOAD.  Here are some words (some relatively recent) the NOAD has that the American Heritage does not have: macarana (the dance), tamagotchi (the Japanese toy), October Surprise, Hamas (the militant Palestinian group), heat-seeking, (as a missile) tarte Tatin, solid south, spaceship earth.      -Although the NOAD lacks color, it has many effective illustrations, and it even devotes full pages to maps.  The American Heritage is visually more appealing with its 4.000 color pictures complete with a nice design layout.      -A big advantage of the American Heritage is that it details some interesting etymological histories of about 400 common words.  For instance the American Heritage dictionary gives a 13-line history on the word Kangaroo, explaining that it is not from an Aborigine meaning \\"I do not know,\\" and then proceeds to explain the true history of the word.   The American Heritage also has usage notes on over 750 synonyms, 100 notes on regionalisms, 500 notes on usage issues, and 50 notes on the social dimensions of some words.       -Although the NOAD does not give these selected, interesting word histories, overall the NOAD etymology is done much better than the American Heritage's etymology.  The NOAD's etymological explanations are consistently more detailed, and will frequently add a time frame when the word came into use, e.g. early 17th century (although it will not give specific years), something the American Heritage does not.  The NOAD will give folk etymology of some words, and like the American Heritage will give notes on proper usage and help the reader/writer use the right word with synonyms.       -One huge advantage the NOAD has over the American Heritage is that it adds many , many more common word phrase origins associated with a word, including proverbs, clichés, etc.  For instance the word `pie\\" n. the NOAD will list the phrases \\"as easy as pie\\" \\"as sweet as pie\\" \\"a slice of the pie\\" and \\"pie in the sky\\" (and giving definitions of each phrase) while the American Heritage just lists and defines \\"pie in the sky.\\"  The NOAD will also give the origin of a few phrases such as \\"flash in the pan\\" (from the failure of gunpowder to ignite properly to fire a gun).  The American Heritage does none of this with its phrases, but note that the American Heritage Dictionary publishes a separatebook on word phrase origins, which is probably the reason it places little emphasis on them in its main dictionary.      -The NOAD is superior in the biographical entries to the American Heritage.  Each dictionary will have some people the other will not, but when they are similar, the NOAD almost always gives more information in a biographical entry.   The NOAD is also superior in geographical entries. food entries, and political terms.  The NOAD is also better at including entries one would normally find in an encyclopedia, for instance Tamil Tigers, Hammond Organ, Abbey Road are in the NOAD, but not in the American Heritage.      -The NOAD is slightly better in giving information about nations of the world.  The American Heritage's entries on nations is short and very basic, while the NOAD's, though not much longer, it will nevertheless give a better history of a country than the American Heritage will.       I love dictionaries, but in comparing these two dictionaries, the NOAD to me has its pulse on the English language more than the American Heritage, and so NOAD would be my first choice.  The American Heritage Dictionary however is still very good.  If you love words, you should get them both to enjoy the variety each provides.
B0006284JQ|4.0|It's pretty daring of Britney to have released a greatest hits package after four or so albums, but she has had some mega hits. People can argue whether she's solid crap or solid gold as an artist, but she's definitely gotten a lot of attention, probably least of all for her music. Especially lately.  This is a great collection, though, in terms of dance music, with Toxic, I'm a Slave 4 U, Oops I Did It Again, and Baby Hit Me One More Time and more (I still don't like that Madonna collaboration she did, though, just offputting to me!). I wanted something with some poppy, dancey elements to it, and wasn't disappointed.  I do love the two new tracks, as they're fun and make you want to dance, though Do Something seemed familiar to me, and then I realized it reminded me of  No Doubt, off their Rock Steady album.   I'm not crazy about her ballads, as I don't think her voice is that good (and I find it odd that a lot of her tracks feature a lot of digital manipulation -- why is that? Though I think I know the answer), but I just fastforward and am perfectly happy to listen on, enjoy a little fluff and inject a little energy into my day. It's like junk food, you can't live on it, but sometimes a taste hits the spot.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Lets not beat around the bush, if you have a blu ray player GET THIS SERIES NOW!!!, it is one of the best ways to show off your new blu ray player to your family and friends to show them what high def is all about.All though its not 100% perfect (some scenes were shot in standard def and are noticeably softer and grainier and there is the odd occasion of screen banding and flickering)but were talking like 2 to 5 percent of the whole series and the myriad of breathtaking scenes more than makes up for it. As for the documentary itself, it is interesting, entertaining and educational all at the same time and doesnt get monotonous or boring as some other documentaries i've seen.
1594489505|5.0|Pick up and savor this intensely-moving survival story, which shows the possibility of love and joy amidst the worst abuse and deprivations.  The story of two women in Afghanistan, it follows Mariam and Laila from childhood to marriage, through Soviet occupation, the jihad, and the Taliban. I was hoping so hard for a happy ending for all of the characters, but the tragic sacrifice at the end seemed absolutely inevitable.  I read this book on vacation, and was awake at 2 a.m. sobbing, trying not to wake the rest of the family.  Hosseini is a nuanced developer of characters: with even the worst villains, you understand how the circumstances of their lives lead to their actions.  You will never forget these brave, finely-drawn women,or the simple and lyrical prose that opens a window to a life of heartache and hope in a war-torn land.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Went to watch it when it came out at the movies, its pretty much all action from beginning to end with epic battle sequences.It was filmed totally in blue screen (live actors in front of a blue screen with the backgrounds put in digitally) so it has a very unique look that will look very impressive in high def so if you got a blu ray player (or hddvd player) get this movie you wont be disappointed!
0800141660|5.0|Fabulous, wonderful, beautiful, funny, touching movie. I am a huge Austen fan and Sense and Sensibility (along with Pride and Prejudice) is my all time favorite movie. Great cast - gorgeous scenery - wonderful love story (or should I say stories!!!) between the two sisters. Every time I watch it (which is ALOT!)- it always makes me cry! This is a must have movie on your shelf! Make sure your tissues are next to it!
B000MQ58VI|5.0|The picture quality (as with all disney blu ray movies) is top notch.As for the movie, its a little kiddie when compared to other animated movies such as the shrek movies but its enjoyable all the way through and is highly recommended
B00005MP58|5.0|Is this the most amazing, wonderful, breathtaking love story EVER?!?!?!? I have seen 3 different versions of this movie - this one with Colin Firth is theeeeee BEST! I admit that I do like the version with Keira Knightley, but I have to give the A & E version the prize! Firth is Darcy thru and thru. The casting is superb. I know I have seen this 10 times and each time it's better than the last! This is the version to buy. The scenery is breathtaking and the acting does not get any better.
B00005ASGG|5.0|The critics panned THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE when it was first released in April 1962, Not least because it went over much of the same ground explored in FORT APACHE (1948). But the general public thought otherwise and the test of time has proved the latter right.  Shot in black and white, with two obviously over-aged stars and mostly studio-bound the only concession to its day was the wide-screen aspect! Gene Pitney also had a huge hit with a song of the same name released at the same time but omitted from the soundtrack because John Ford was said to have hated it!      This dark-tale is of the Old West versus the advancing 20th Century. A train draws into the small western town of Shinbone the only passengers to get off, are Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) they are accosted by local reporter for `The Star' young Charlie Hasbrouck (Joseph Hoover) followed by his editor Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young). Stoddard reveals that they are in town for the funeral of an old friend Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). In the funeral parlour they find Doniphon's coffin guarded by his faithful black servant Pompey (Woody Strode). Scott persuades the Senator to give his account. Meanwhile ex-town-marshal Link Appleyard (Andy Devine) takes Hallie on a buckboard ride out to Toms burnt out old house, here they find masses of cactus roses in bloom, Link steps down and picks one for her.    Now back in Shinbone the story is then revealed in flashback - A gang led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) ambushed Stoddard's stagecoach. He tries to defend a fellow female passenger but suffers a savage beating in the process and is left for dead. Tom Doniphon brings him to his girl friend Hallie Ericson at PETER'S PLACE (a venue for home cooking) at Shinbone after finding him on the trail! On discovering who attacked him Doniphon told Stoddard \\"Liberty Valance's the toughest man south of the Picketwire [River]  - next to me\\". Stoddard is a lawyer by profession and is determined to bring Valance to justice he elicits the reluctant help of Marshal Link Appleyard and Shinbone Star founder and editor Dutton Peabody (Edmund O'Brien) in the meantime he helps out washing dishes and serving tables at PETER'S PLACE, he also runs a class teaching people to read and write, whilst telling them that `the pen is mightier than the sword'. One night Valance and two of his henchmen Floyd (Strother Martin) and Reese (Lee Van Cleef) burst into PETER'S PLACE hijack a table and generally causing trouble, Floyd gleefully points out to Valance, that he has spotted Stoddard waiting on tables. Valance trips Stoddard causing him to drop Doniphon's steak dinner on the floor. Doniphon and Valance square up for a gunfight after Doniphon ordered Valance to pick up the steak, but Stoddard picks up the steak to ease the situation, all concerned know sooner or later Valance will be back.    As the tension continues to mount Stoddard is helping out Editor Peabody who allows Ranse to hang his Attorney at Law sign outside the Star Newspaper Office, he is also going off and practicing with a six gun twice a couple of times a week. Tom Doniphon tells Hallie that he going north of the Picketwire [River] for some time horse-trading on his return he reports trouble brewing with the big ranchers who have recruited Liberty Valance and his henchmen to mess up the coming Territorial Convention for Statehood, Stoddard and Peabody are finally selected as the two delegates required whilst Valance was completely rejected. In an editorial Peabody blackens Valances name. Later Valance, Floyd and Reese beat Mr Peabody to within an inch of his life, Ranse sends the marshal to find Valance for a final showdown. Although Liberty wounds Ranse with his first shot - Ranse somehow manages to get off a shot, Valance falls to the ground and is pronounced \\"dead\\" in the street by Doc Willoughby. Stoddard is plagued by guilt and is only relieved when Doniphon fills in the missing details. Following the shooting of Valance, the wounded Stoddard is elevated to super hero known to all as \\"The man who shot Liberty Valance\\" he also wins Hallie's hand in marriage and goes back East to pursue a life in politics. Whilst having lost Hallie, a disappointed Tom Doniphon steps aside and retreats to into reclusive obscurity.    Stoddard having completed his story to the press was surprised when the editor tears up the script Ranse asked Scott \\"You're not going to us the story Mr Scott\\". \\"This is the West, Sir\\". Scott said. \\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend\\". Finally Hallie left a cactus rose on Toms coffin as a symbol of their lost love. So with Donophin buried and their business concluded in Shinbone the Stoddards catch the train back to Washington they are welcomed onboard once again by the conductor Jason Tully (Willis Bouchey) Ranse thanks Jason for all his help and Jason replies \\"Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance\\".    A fine cast with some great performances all round although the likes of  Lee Marvin, Edmound O'Brien, Ken Murray and John Carradine \\"Ham it up a little\\". Whilst the two leads were in reality too old for their parts with the love interest Vera Miles being some twenty-odd years their junior, she however gives a beautiful restrained performance as the woman torn between two men! Ford too was on top form with the domestic scenes in Peter's Place cooking and serving up the dinner plate sized steaks to a full house followed up by the enevitable washing up - BRILLIANT!    It was near the end now for the most successful Director / Star relationship in making Western Movies. Ahead lay. \\"The Civil War\\" chapter of  HOW THE WEST WAS WON (1962) and finally a non-Western DONOVAN'S REEF (1963). But Big John Wayne was far from finished, increditably over the next dozen or so years, another twenty-one films lay ahead, fourteen of them Westerns including his Oscar winning TRUE GRIT!    This Widescreen Collection DVD includes Sub Titles, Theatrical Trailer and Scene Selection. This film really deserves the full treatment of a Special Two Disc Edition  with extras including Gene Pitney's title song. Nevertheless a must for all Western fans, others should enjoy it too!
1594489505|5.0|I really enjoyed The Kite Runner which deals with the men of Afganistan.  I was anxiously awaiting the next book by this author.  A Thousand Splendid Suns is about the women of Afiganistan and was very hard to put down.  There was again rich development of the characters, but the story line was a little unsettling.   I would recommend the book to anyone who would like to learn more about another culture and especially the Middle East.
B0016BWACI|2.0|This movie certainly stands as a singular achievement of its time, and also as a milestone in the development of film puppetry in general.<br />The unusual sense of reality that comes with the intricate puppet technology and the strong integration of the soundtrack provide a unique experience on more than one level.<br /><br />The crippling caveat of this film for me is that a lot of creativity has been invested into making things look ugly to a degree that can in fact be difficult to watch. Not only are the Skeksis a bunch so awful that they could give normally sensitive viewers gastrospasms, it is also the action itself (extended scenes show them crumble to dust, drain sweet innocent beings from their soul to drink it as juice, or feast in the most nausea-inducing manner) that are hard to bear, will give children nightmares and leave you with a definite lack of appetite.<br /><br />As much as I love specialty movies from the early 80ies (another gem from this period is the original TRON, for example) I would not want to watch \\"The Dark Chrystal\\" again any time soon - having all this pain in my brain once was more than enough.
0553801503|3.0|Feast for Crows is a great example of Martin's brutal, emotional, and coplex writing but as a stand-alone book is too lacking in advancement of the plot. Crows focuses on the journey of half of the characters (the other half to be explored more in Dance of Dragons, forthcoming) but even those few--Brienne, maid of Tarth; Samwell Tarly, (Sam, of the Wall); Arya and Sansa (both having changed their identities); Cersei; Jaime; and the Ironborn, viking-like sea warriors along with the sand-princes of Dorne--don't move significantly from beginning to end.     It is a beautiful and brutal glimpse into a war-torn country and the influence of the game of thrones on the \\"smallfolk\\"--death, torture, rape, and crimes unspeakable run rampant. The complexities make it interesting, trying to decipher (despite the false reporting of the characters) who is really dead and where everyone's loyalties lie. Character development is the most satisfying part of this book--those who loved to hate the despicable Jaime and Cersei will be happy to see one change for the better and the other get their come-uppance; while one character believed to be dead reappears and one of the Stark girls seems to have hope for the future.    However, despite the wonderful writing, this book will be far more satisfying with its companion volume in hand (once it comes out)and those who love Daenerys will be left hungry for more with only a single preview chapter about her at the end of the book.
0698115635|3.0|Perhaps this book would be better for me and my son if I knew the song that supposedly goes with the book title.  Wouldn't it be great to have a button in the front that played the tune of the song so everyone would get the fun of this book?  My 3 year old likes the book, but I think he would love it if I knew the song.
1572707208|5.0|I have been listening to \\"Eat that Frog\\" in my car for a couple of weeks.   It is going to be one of those that I listen to again and again.   It is great advice on how to be more productive and efficient with your time.
B000NGTJTY|3.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Let me first say that I didn't dislike this movie, but I didn't LOVE it either. I think Mark Wahlberg was outstanding in this movie and hands down my favorite character. The problem that I did have was the fact that certain parts of the plot were not believable. Specifically the fact that Jack Nicholson's character couldn't figure out who the mole was AND the fact that there were numerous moles. I didn't buy it, hence my disappointment. But, if you have some time, I'd say watch it anyway.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Hayley Mills, Hayley Mills, Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara. Need I say more? This movie is pretty much flawless. I was so thrilled when Disney put this out on DVD. I have watched it numerous times since purchasing it from Amazon and I am never disappointed.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I feel duped.<br /><br />No one told me Brokeback Mountain was about us. It was supposed to be about other people, you know, homosexuals. That's the hype, right, two gay cowboys in love.<br /><br />So why did I see my friends and I in this story? Adolescent girls who couldn't imagine escaping the narrow confines of our strict upbringing. Young women struggling to find our way in a society which promised to prize independence but, too often, rewarded conformity.<br /><br />When you're stuck inside the status quo, when it's all you know, you've played a part in this film. And I, for one, have acted, at some point, for some person, rather than risk exposing myself to condemnation and punishment.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain, with its vulnerable performances and clear-sighted direction, is about our natural human struggle. Our longing to belong pressed up against our longing to be ourselves. Our desire to live peacefully (and safely) pressed up against our need to live truthfully.<br /><br />This film reminded me that liberty can be a shared delusion. We enjoy certain freedoms, yes, yes, but that doesn't necessarily make us free.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's KITE RUNNER is one of my ALL TIME favorite books! Despite having read only two books by him, I am a fan of his writing for life. The way he writes can't help but grab you and hold you in. I finished the Kite Runner in a day and this one in two nights. The pages kept turning and I couldn't put it down.    In A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS, Hosseini tells a story about two women and their journeys. Both characters touch your heart and feel so real that you feel that you know them or want to. It is a love story, a story of friendship and once again the story of Afghanistan, a magnificent country that is burning. When you read it you are swept up in the characters life that when it ends you have to remind yourself that you are a separate entity. Hosseini has a way with words that you cannot deny and I am so glad he has recieved the success he has.    Now the most important questions....when is he writing the next one! I am addicted....
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This story from the heart shows the triumph of the human spirit. It also added to my distaste for the I.R.S.  This story brings inspiration to anyone who has struggled, or is struggling now, to make a living in a dog eat dog world. A father tries to follow his dream while also caring for his five year old son. They endure events that would make many people give up. I was so happy this story ended on a positive note, for there are so many true stories like this one that do not end happily.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000J4QWM2|3.0|As another Michael Mann and Miami Vice TV lover, my initial response to this was disgust. The fact that they didn't use the opening theme alone was too bad, but the missed opportunity to revisit the 80's and then the casting of Farrell kept me out of the theatre.   But thanks to On Demand cable, and the knowledge that a Director's Cut is available too, I figured to see this, then the Cut and compare.  Ultimately I am amongst the disappointed, but not for lack of certain appreciation. Mann is a master of movement, and like few directors can unify style with grace and substance. He also uses wonderfully exhilarating music. I am a sucker for this skill, and when he uses it here, I enjoyed the film. The supporting cast, Luis Tosar as Jesus Montoya and John Ortiz as Jose Yero were standouts. There is also some very impressive masculine hair (beards, goatees, burns, etc.) in this.   Otherwise, it lacked in many ways. The Gong Li subplot was terrible. The lack of relationship between Farrell and Foxx angered. Then messy accents and inadible dialogue confused.   In ending, Mann's m.o. of \\"Leave now, life is short, time is luck,\\" gets sucked away by Farrell and Li's foolish relationship. Mann's heroes are loners and operate within certain codes. Here Crockett ignores these codes, thus the pride and thrill of Crockett and Tubbs and their vice crew's bond (what made the TV series cool and quirky-remember the van with the bug on top?) is nonexistent.   I really give it 2.5 stars, but round up for Mann.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I recently purchased this cd because I heard and loved the clever tune \\"Ticks\\" Now that I have it I love every song on it the guitar work is incredible and the lyrics are great.  I actually went through all of his CD's and realized I am a Brad Paisley fan and just purchased all the others.
1594489505|5.0|I liked The Kite Runner.  I loved this book.  It is astounding.  I think every woman in America should read it.  Magnificant story, very eye-opening.
B000RJO58M|5.0|This was a GREAT movie! If you liked Shaun of the Dead you are going to love this movie because it is more of the same but twice as good. The jokes are a breath of fresh air compared to what traditional \\"Hollywood\\" thinks is funny these days and the two main actors have the same kind of repor that you are already used to from their previous movie.    Bottomline is this is a great action comedy. The main character is believable, and his sidekick is very lovable. Another great flick for fans of HD DVD!
B000JCETC4|5.0|The sounds of Pink Floyd, and both Waters' and Gilmour's solo works have been constants soundtracks throughout my life. This album joins the others in this auspicious place.    Gilmour has crafted a thoroughly beautiful album, both lyrically and musically. This is truly soul-soothing stuff. Its one of those that when you get to the end, only silence or the repeat button are worthy follow-ons.    This is a quiet album, one that calls for an undisturbed afternoon in your favourite lounge. But quiet means neither slow nor boring. This is album is proof why Gilmour is one of the wolds greatest musicians.    The haunting ethereal beauty of the songs and the impeccable virtuous guitar solos will have you stopping whatever you are doing to listen. It is full of subtle and refined details, even witty and quirky, yet never a sound out of place. It is minimalist yet lush. It is warm and organic. It is consistent in its vibe altough the songs are quite different from one another. It will make you feel good, make your eyes water, it will make you shiver and smile.    This album is not Pink Floyd, it is 100% David Gilmour. If you are a DG fan, this is an outstanding continuation/evolution of his solo work. If you are not familiar with his work, then this is the album to get familiar with. This is a fantastic timeless album that defies description. Get it. Get into it. Its a masterpiece.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|This was one of the best action flicks of the year to date. In fact the only other movie that might take that spot is if Bourne Ultimatum is better than its predecessors. In any case, this movie and HD DVD make the perfect pair. The audio and video quality will be unsurpassed by the regular DVD quality and equalled by its Blu Ray counterpart. What makes this better than its Blu Ray counterpart is its extra features that are exclusive to HD DVD. Even better is the fact that the cheapest HD DVD player is $249 on Amazon as compared to the cheapest Blu Ray player which is $500 (probablyabout $450 on Amazon). Also if you have an Xbox 360 you can pick up the HD DVD add-on for only $200, a great deal and hundreds of dollars cheaper than the equivilent Blu Ray version.    300 + HD DVD = a GREAT movie.
B000001F9E|5.0|I'm tempted to give \\"Jailbreak\\" a 5.  It has a couple of songs that are 5s, one that's beyond a 5, some 3s and maybe a couple of 1s.  Part of the problem is these guys are so multi-talented that it seems like they can't decide whether they're a mid-70s radio-pop band or a mid-70s hard guitar rock band.  Not every song rises to the level of great, but each one of them has some great musical ideas and phrases.      Here are some highlights:  \\"Fight or Fall\\" - A bluesy, soulful vocal featuring bassist/vocalist Phil Lynott at his soulful Irish best.   \\"Emerald\\" - Twin Gibson Les Paul guitars cranking out the classic analog amp 70s electric sound (and what a nice sound it is).  Elements of a recognizable traditional Scottish melody transformed into a hammering metal anthem about swords, pillage and mayhem.  \\"Warriors\\" - Another metal tune with a pure junior high swords hack-and-slash theme.  A good song just for the drumming and guitar hook refrain in the middle.  \\"The Boys are Back in Town\\" - The familiar radio sing-alonger that made these Irishmen famous in the U.S.  \\"Cowboy Song\\" - This one deserves to be known as one of the greatest all-time rock and rollers.  An upbeat, melodious hard guitar tour-de-force that carries one along for a happy ride to the end.  I played this one in the car with a full carload and everybody literally got speechless throughout.  It's worth owning the album just for this one song.    If you're tempted, just get it.  You can just skip the songs you don't like and go right to the really fine ones.
0743233832|4.0|This book is a collection of philosophical thoughts that were written down by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius.  The Hicks brothers did an excellent job of translating these thoughts into Modern English. Some words appear to be inaccurate as they refer to concepts or atomic particles that were likely unknown to the Romans.  Regardless, the use of these words and concepts does not diminish the greater point being made by Emperor Aurelius.      The book is only 145 pages long and is broken into twelve \\"books\\" or chapters.  Each chapter usually runs between 30-60 thoughts or passages.  Because the book is essentially a collection of passages, it is not something that one should sit down and read cover to cover.  Some readers may want to use a pencil to underline certain thoughts for quick reference.  One nice aspect of this book is that several significant passages were highlighted in gray boxes for quick recall.  All in all, this book is best read in short bursts.  The reader may also want to re-read certain passages over again in order to grasp Marcus Aurelius' true meaning.     The thoughts presented by Marcus Aurelius offer a unique perspective on how the Romans viewed life and death.  Marcus spent a great deal of time thinking about death and how people should approach it with dignity.  He also looked down on those people who approached death in an undignified way, often with \\"histrionics.\\"  No doubt, these were the Christians who were being put to death and persecuted at the time.  Despite this unique Roman perspective on life and death, the book is full of useful guidance. Most of his ideas are still applicable today. Some of the very same thoughts can be found in modern-day books on leadership.  For example, Marcus noted \\"anger is as much a proof of weakness as grief.  Both involve being wounded and giving in to one's wounds.\\"  This bit of wisdom is as applicable today as it was for the Romans.       Bottom line, this is an easy to read book of philosophicalpassages.  The thoughts on leadership, death, and how to live a good life are as applicable today as they were in the time of the Romans.  The reader would be hard put to find another book with as much wisdom as is contained in these 145 pages.

B000E0OBK6|2.0|Well, Lt.Col North didn't actually use the word 'sucks.'  But he said it was a waste of his money, and he extorted his listeners to save 2 hours of their life. He actually had hoped it would portray Marines in a good light, but said he found nothing redeeming about this movie.
B000022TSY|5.0|Well I'm 38 years too late but I just discovered this movie.  This is not one of my most favorite movies.  There really aren't any hippy movies like it.  I mean you have Cheech and Chong, Half baked, and a handful of other comedies.  But nothing serious, hippies weren't just bumbling morons.  This portrays hippies in a real dramatic light. Let's you in their world and wanting more.  I liked it and highly recommend it.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I loved this movie, and I have watched it over and over again. The CD is also one of my favorites that I listen to constantly. I was very impressed by the duet, \\"Way Back Into Love,\\" with Hugh Grant and Haley Bennett. All of Haley's songs were great, especially \\"Entering Bootytown.\\" This little girl is a cutie, and I expect to see her become a big hit when she releases her first CD, soon. I think Hugh's solo, \\"Don't Write Me Off,\\" is very good. I had no idea he could sing so well, and Drew Barrymore didn't do bad, either, with her demo version of \\"Way Back Into Love.\\" It was worth the money just to hear the Haley/Hugh duet of \\"Way Back Into Love.\\" They made a great team, and the song has wonderful lyrics, with a haunting melody. Loved it, loved it, loved it!
1423328612|5.0|Ken Follett's EYE OF THE NEEDLE receives a lively full cast reading with all the life of a radio show, and tells of an enemy spy who holds the key to the ultimate Nazi victory. Only an isolated Englishwoman's love stands in his way in this vivid story of war, romance and drama.
B000J103PC|3.0|Having just read the book, I decided to check out the movie as well. Streep was excellent as Miranda Priestly and managed to capture the viciousness of the original character. Hathaway was also good as well. What I didn't enjoy was the changed ending. I wish that Andrea Sachs had confronted Priestly in Paris (and told her off) like she did in the book. I think the movie missed much of the bitterness of Andrea's wasted year and made it too much of a learning experience for her. The fact that some reviewers could come out of the theatre thinking that this was a story about empowered women shows that the movie didn't get the right tone at the end.    An another note, the volume on this DVD is way off. I found it nearly impossible to hear some of the dialogue, even though I had it on full blast. Then the music would overwhelm me. They didn't calibrate it well.

B000LC55F2|3.0|I liked this move with all it's twists and turns, right up until the very end where the Prestige was revealed, then I didn't like it so much.  I think I got tired from suspending my disbelief for so long.  Hugh Jackman is a great actor and so is Christen Bale, but the story was not my cup of tea.  Look for a neat-o performance from David Bowie as Nichola Tesla.
B00004W221|3.0|Needed to view this inspirational film for school. It arrived on time,  in good condition and was a wonderful movie to watch.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I liked this one better than the other movie with Hugh Jackman.  In the end, this one is more believeable, and the characters are more likeable.  And the story is better.  Poor Ed norton loves a girl, and will do anything to get her back.  Everyone loves a love story, and this one has an ending suitable to all tastes.
B000000OU4|5.0|I'd say this is Pat Metheny Group's most accessible album to date. That's my opinion anyway and I have all the others. It's certainly their funkiest and as close to the edge of smooth jazz as the group is ever likely to get. There are even beautiful but easy vocal hooks to sing or hum along to (performed by David Blamires and Mark Ledford) on a couple of the songs. Metheny plays guitar (and guitar synth, of course), with Lyle Mays on piano and keyboards, Steve Rodby on acoustic and electric bass, Paul Wertico on drums and Luis Conte on percussion. (Ledford also plays trumpet).<br /><br />I would like to hope that this album, when it was released back in 1995, brought new fans into the fold without scaring away any established ones. Personally, I loved it from first listen. I'm not not overly keen on the title track (though I do appreciate its brilliant artistry) but the rest of the album is typically flawless. Favourite tunes include the opener \\"Here To Stay\\", \\"The Girls Next Door\\", \\"Episode d'Azur\\", \\"Something To Remind You\\" and \\"Red Sky\\". I find Mays' piano solos on some of the selections are particularly heartwarming and if I were going to introduce PMG to a friend, this is the CD I would buy for them as a gift.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|What a great movie!  Full of great acting and a great story.  Both men (DiCaprio and Damon) find themselves in a situation where honesty is a luxury they cannot afford.

But it has a satisfying ending that is sure to please all.  A+

B00003CX9Q|5.0|I know many adults who, when pressed, will admit to crying during ET. It's a movie that really knows how to play your heart-strings. The basic story is pretty straight-forward. A cute, friendly alien gets stranded on earth, and is befriended by a young boy and girl who try to help the alien get back home again. In an era where most aliens are evil, nasty creatures bent on world domination, the police and FBI agents are all out to grab and investigate this menace. So you end up with the nasty, dark government against the cute, innocent kids.    I saw this movie as a teen and enjoyed it greatly. I've seen the movie *with* kids and they loved it. It really is a movie that appeals to all ages, and it does that without talking down to anyone. It's earned its spot in the AFI top 100 movie listing with its plot, pacing, acting and directing.    If I have a complaint here, it's with the \\"redone\\" 2002 version. The movie was great as it was when first put out. There was no need to alter the ET main character. His whole appeal was that he was organic and someone you could relate to. Why turn him into a CGI thing?    Also, I have an issue with them turning the police and FBI's weapons into walkie-talkies. Sure, kids don't need to be exposed to Pulp Fiction degrees of blood and violence. However, to say that police officers can't carry weapons makes no sense to me. What's next - gunfighters in the old west who walk around with empty holsters? When real police do community policing and walk beats, should they hide their guns so that kids don't see them? I found this completely unnecessary and more than a little insulting to the intelligence of the youngsters watching with me.    Watch the original movie, which is what the AFI voted in - not the \\"PC version\\".
B00005JNS0|5.0|For some reason I resisted seeing this movie and waited until it had long been on DVD.  What a mistake!  This is a wonderful little movie and, while all children (and adults) will love it, it is nice for little boys to have something that's not in the princess genre.

1582701709|1.0|From its slick, fake-parchment pages with pictures of a wax seal `S', to such comments as those of \\"Dr. Joe Vitale\\" on p. 48: \\"This is fun. It's like having the Universe as your catalogue. You flip through it and say, `I'd like to have this experience and I'd like to have that product and I'd like to have a person like that.' It is You placing your order with the Universe. It's really that easy.\\" this book is a paginated cringe of embarrassing idiocy.     Even if you accept the whole Universe-as-Sears-catalog premise (or as your own personal genie, as Byrne suggests [cringe] on pp.45-46) this whole book is simply a bad, though well-marketed repackaging of one of the more popular movements in what my husband refers to as charismania: \\"name it and claim it\\", or the Positive Confession, or the Word-Faith movement, a la Norman Vincent Peale/Robert Schuller/ Kenneth Hagin/Kenneth Copeland/Robert Tilton and their ilk.     The historical roots of this movement lie in the occult, and most recently, in New Thought and its off-shoot, the Mind Science cults. Any Biblical basis is found only in the \\"interpretations\\" of its leaders, not in generally accepted Christian theology. Not that Byrne makes explicit reference to Jesus - at least not in the first 50 pages I forced myself through in car-crash-passing fascination. After reading that genie analogy, I decided that if I were going to indulge in off the hook banality, I'd opt for the intellectual honesty of a Simpsons episode.      ICXC NIKA

Don't expect what you have heard from her before and you will not be disappointed.......Listen to Hole, Haunted, and the absolutely spellbinding Irvine...
0060763892|4.0|I have been a fan of James Rollins since reading Amazonia, but up to now it was mostly a \\"fun read\\" between other books.  With Map of Bones, my interest in and impression of the author grew significantly.  However, after reading \\"The Judas Strain\\", I knew that Mr. Rollins had finally found his stride as a writer.  The characters are more realistic than ever, the story is fascinating and believable, though some of the scenes on the ship are perhaps more graphic than needed, and his writing style is smoother and tighter.  The only reason I gave this book a 4 out of 5 is that, having achieved this level of writing, I am hopeful that his next book will be even better.

B00000255X|5.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />Bob Dylan's \\"Desire\\" is not a record album.  It is an audio storybook.  The images created resonate with such brilliance they don't dissipate when the music ends, they shine brighter.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Hurricane\\" places you at the scene of the bar where professional fighter Rubin \\"Hurricane Carter\\" was accused and found guilty of a crime that is still talked about today.  Dylan thinks justice wasn't served and gives you a history lesson in one of the most powerful and riveting compositions ever penned.<br /><br />\\"Mozambique\\" is exquisite as Dylan shares his thoughts on the beauty of a nation located in southern Africa.  His descriptive phrases make you feel as you visited the continent along with him.<br /><br />Dylan songs don't need continuity to flow.  He is a master at taking us to the opposite edges of the planet from tune to tune.  \\"Joey\\" ends (the song about the life of a mobster) and we are transported to South America for \\"Romance In Durango.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sara\\" pays homage to his ex-wife.  His heart is not only on his sleeve but you feel the blood dripping from the wound.<br /><br />All along the journey Emmylou Harris is superlative with background vocals and Scarlet Rivera's violin could bring tears to a clown.<br />The period of \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" and \\"Desire\\" could never have enough accolades, so we'll call it \\"Positively Dylan\\" and play the CD for the 456th time.<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"
1932100660|5.0|All those interested in improving or staying in good health should read this book. It's a readable book with the first 2/3rd showing the effect of diet on health and the last 1/3rd revealing how the Federal government, dairy, meat, pharmaceutical industry and the medical establishment collaborate to the detriment of our health. This book was not published until the author, a veterinarian and researchist who grew up in the mid West raising cattle, retired from his work when it was safe for him to expose what he learned. Coincidentally, 6 months after this book was published, the FDA decided that the FDA Advisory council representatives from the pharmaceutical, dairy, and meat industry could continue to play an advisory role on the council, but would no longer be allowed to vote. As a result of what I learned from reading this book and changing my dietary habits, my systolic and diastolic blood pressure dropped 20 points and my cholesterol and other blood work up results (LDL, HDL, Triglycerides, ratios, etc.) improved significantly from moderate danger to the low end of the normal range. I've been so impressed by this book that I've bought several books, 3 at a time as needed, just to give to family members and friends, who've noticed the improvement in my energy, appearance, and health and expressed interest in the book. I sure wish this book was available before my two angioplasties and a triple by pass. But I'm in better shape today than I ever was before the medical treatments were necessary to save my life.
0385339089|5.0|A Disney movie for adults, and I mean that in a good way.  Written with intelligence, wit, and a healthy dose of contempt for authority figures that are too full of themselves.  The protagonist is written as a smart character despite his tender years.  He is alternately tough as tungsten and then vulnerable.     This is great summer reading.    Even though this has been made into a movie, and you may have seen it, read the book.  Then you can be one of those people who can say, \\"I read the book.\\"

B000002J09|5.0|The original and definitive heavy metal band, Led Zeppelin made their mark in several other categories with their fourth album.  The vocals of Robert Plant, guitar playing of Jimmy Page, and drumming of John Bonham are all the stuff of legend.  John Paul Jones brings extra versatility and originality on bass, keyboard AND acoustic guitar.  The songs:<br /><br />Black Dog - blues-influenced (like a lot of earlier Zeppelin), loud and raunchy (in the best kind of way), some over-the-top vocal stylings<br />Rock And Roll - barn-burning blues and a great vehicle to show off one of the greatest rock drummers ever<br />The Battle Of Evermore - inventive art rock that proved that these guys were not only great rockers, but great artists as well<br />Stairway To Heaven - the definitive power ballad<br />Misty Mountain Hop - more barn-burning blues with monstrously huge guitar sounds and distinctive electric piano riff<br />Four Sticks - raucous art rock, using a crazy time signature and chord voicing that few bands other than Rush and Jethro Tull would dare to touch<br />Going To California - yes, they can do acoustic folk rock better than anyone else too<br />When The Levee Breaks - more rowdy blues, this time with some gritty harmonica to give it a different vibe<br /><br />The production and engineering behind this album are the icing on the cake.  Recording students are still studying and copying this stuff and trying to reproduce the \\"Bonham drum sound\\" to this day.  The generous echoes and overdubs on Plant's vocals somehow never seem overdone or dated.<br /><br />This is the amazing work of an amazing team of players and recording experts on their best days ever.  Rock fans should be intimately familiar with this timeless and hugely influential CD.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|To tell the truth, I was a bit dissappointed with the Octavarium. I tend to listen to DT albums over and over and over but I could not sustain suc a relationship with Oct; not that it was musically poor but something else i guess.    The new album on the other hand brought back those feelings. I have listened and loved every single song in it. Hope u enjoy it too
0893860220|5.0|Putting it plain and simple, the spiritual search was almost a hobby. I read Buddhism and other \\"Eastern\\" philosophical and religious texts for many, many years. I never really understood. Reading this book changed everything.<br /><br />This book sparked a small flame that ended up engulfing the person I took myself to be. The raging inferno consumed the mind, thoughts, concepts, everything I believed, everything I left unexamined... it left the \\"ME\\" in ashes...<br /><br />As Stephen Wolinsky puts it, Nisargadatta's words are like a virus... once you are infected it spreads and leaves no trace of the life story you once held so dear.<br /><br />This book is a living expression of your True Self, the true Guru - if you only get one book, this is the one. But in reality, you don't need any books to discover what you really are. Nisargadatta said that Spirituality was as discardable as dishwater. You already are what you are seeking. You just have to answer one question - who is it that is seeking?
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Prior to purchasing Planet Earth, I had never seen any of its episodes. I heard many good things, though, and owning a PS3 and an HDTV made the Blu-ray package a no-brainer. My friends and family have seen a few episodes, and they seem to really enjoy it. I highly recommend Planet Earth for anyone.    For Parents: There are graphic scenes of violence. (eg Sharks eating, Chimpanzees cannibalizing, etc.)
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Many years ago I read a book about Greek men in love and today I saw a movie that took me to a place where love existed in a form that many would never even dream to reach.  This movie was the ultimate love story as what a man can give to another man by a glance, a touch, and a never ending love.    Everyone was so upset that this movie did not win for Best Picture, but for us who have lived this life this story has won our hearts.......

And indeed they have by putting into practice some of the techniques that were used in several case studies.<br /><br />This book will be of special interest to people who have suffered a stroke and their caretakers.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This will have to be the definition of change. There are two trends of thought when you hear this album. First \\"what happened?\\" which hit me instantly with an unsavory curiosity, and Two \\"This is genius\\".     What's genius about it is not entirely the music. I have a VERY wide taste in music, from Chevelle to Cold Play to Brand New to Afro Celt, but they all revolve around that thing we call Rock. What Linkin Park has done here is delivered, unknowingly to us, what they planned. Read the album book, you;ll understand    What band can change and perform each song in its respective genre as if they had been doing it all their career? Not many, and that is what LP is proving. These guys know ROCK MUSIC and its flavors. It forces you to rethink what a group of people making music means.     It is not experimentation simply because I've heard songs like these before, using similar note patterns and themes and melodies. So in that respect its not.    What it is is pure Change. Pure proof that Linkin Park can in-fact Play music. You will be confident that if you asked Linkin Park to sound like Box Car Racer, they could. If you asked them to sound like a fast up beat Ska band, they could. Thats the thing people aren't getting...And that may be the greater danger here. As consumers of music, we find niches that are comfortable, and our minds, as evolved \\"pattern recognition\\" intellectual beings, seperate them into categories. This is what was VIOLATED in this album. Linkin Park VIOLATED our expectations...for whoever that may mean dissapointment, curiousity, or just plain awestruck (my case).    Linkin Park Bravo! Thank you for this fresh album...it brings competion, to the other genres in my cd rack, but not to what we conservatively define as \\"LINKIN PARK\\". Which is pretty much why the Logo is changed.    LP fans rest assured, this was \\"proof\\" that they CAN play music, and perhaps we did not need PROOF at this time, but maybe the \\"group of guys making music\\" needed it..forthemselves. to proove to themselves that they're not just some synthesizer beat box raspy screamers. Do you know how many people doubted the drummer's true skill saying that he put on a tecno cd and wasn't drumming?!!    so it is Minutes to Midnight..and LP fans, rest assured, Midnight is coming,the familiar sounds of LP are now ready to be injected with something called \\"evolultion\\"    Now that they know they can evolve its time for LP to evolve Their trademark sound. This is what LP fans are looking for next time, this is what they will appreciate, Experimentation of LP trademark sound..Evolution of LP trademark sound. And if this album isn't a sign that LP is getting sick of their old trademark sound and scratching their heads to Push it beyond, then i dont know what is.     Get this album, even if you're an LP fan...Get it because it's really good, and put it next to your other albums, and leave a slot near your last LP albums for the next one.
0375701427|5.0|Is it Roth or Ruth? If this isn't a home run, I don't know what is. What a gloriously beautiful piece of writing. One supposes that there are those who don't care for Roth, just as there are those who don't like baseball, but for those of us who follow literature the way our fathers followed , say, the Brooklyn Dodgers, this is one of those lifelong memorable performances, a game that will go down in history. For one thing, Roth has immortalized Newark of yesteryear, a most livable place where one could imagine making a life. We see it and America here in full contrast: the good old days vs whatever one would call it today. Roth moves right in. Like Saul Bellow, he is a master at describing decay and squalor. Why is that? Not since Bellow's best and Updike's \\"Rabbit Is Rich\\" have I read descriptions that made me happy - even proud - to be alive. Roth celebrates the unthinkable and makes it true and bearable. Were it not for Roth, we'd run out into the street and get hit by a car which, in Roth's world (and ours), would speed away. But we know what the world could be, thanks to Roth: all of his characters yearn for it or remember it or think they've seen it. \\"American Pastoral\\" is the story of America, before...
0679746323|4.0|As many reviewers here have said, the book is a sea of controversy, challenging a number of important generally-accepted arguments about Mao and his rule.<br /><br />Some of the most prominent claims:<br /><br />Mao's China was Stalin's creation; Mao had received money from the Soviet Union early in his career, and later served basically as Stalin's puppet (though a cunning one at that). Mao's rise to power would have been impossible without the Soviet backing after 1945.<br /><br />Personally, I think the authors fail to come up with enough evidence to support this argument. On the whole the book seems to misrepresent the Soviet actions and motives. There is plenty of evidence in the materials, to which the authors had full access (Stalin-Mao correspondence, Mikoyan talks in 1949 etc) to at least raise serious questions about Stalin's real preferences in China; in fact, much evidence suggests that after 1945 Stalin was initially willing to trade in his special relationship with Mao for a broader agreement with the Guomindang. To this end, and probably not to confuse the \\"imperialists\\", he sponsored CCP-GMD peace talks, handed over territory to the GMD, agreed to suppress anti-GMD rebellion in Xinjiang and Altai, etc. The general tilt of Soviet foreign policy in 1945-46 - not only in China but elsewhere - points to Stalin's willingness to compromise with the West, rather than a propensity towards endless expansion of the Soviet sphere of influence.<br /><br />A related question: the authors argue that the GMD collapse in the Civil War was a result of infiltration by communist spies and of Jiang Jieshi's kind-hearted treatment of the Soviet \\"moles\\" in his ranks. The authors then point to various Soviet \\"sleepers\\", in whose ranks they include people like Zhang Zhizhong, in my view downplaying internal reasons for GMD disunity. After all, one did not have to be a Soviet \\"sleeper\\" to want to play on the Jiang-Mao conflict to maximize personal benefits. Even if some of the so called \\"sleepers\\" in fact did, as the authors claim, had contacts with the Soviets before, this need not mean that they would act on Soviet behalf in China or carry out Stalin's orders.<br /><br />Another major pillar of the book - the role of \\"ideology\\" in Mao's rule. The authors emphasize that Mao was moved first and foremost by considerations of power and prestige, not by fears about \\"revisionism\\" in China, etc. I happen to completely agree with the authors on this point; their argument, backed by detailed evidence, goes a long way to remedy a certain disbalance in favor of the \\"ideological\\" school especially popular since Chen Jian's path-breaking Mao's China and the Cold War.<br /><br />Portrayal of the Cultural Revolution as basically a power struggle is fairly convincing, though one cannot help but have second thoughts. Other authors, including notably Roderick MacFarquhar, admit that there was indeed a power struggle, and yet could there be something else, or why would Mao continue the campaign beyond 1966? In their effort to portray Mao as a cynical manipulator, do the authors overlook his genuine concerns about China's future path?<br /><br />An interesting thesis comes towards the end: Sino-US opening was not a result of Mao's fear of Soviet invasion, but of his effort to regain international prestige after the failure of Maoization of the world. This is a very important argument for what it tells us about Mao's delusion of grandeur, though it probably downplays Mao's fear of the Soviet Union. Yang Kuisong in a well-known article in 2000 issue of Cold War History journal argued that it was precisely Mao's reaction to Zhenbaodao in 1969 that prompted him to rethink relations with the US. This claim has been advanced in other books, for example, Li Zhisui's Private Life of Chairman Mao.<br /><br />Speaking of the Soviet angle, the authors advance a controversial claim that Malinovsky's drunken remark to Zhou Enlai and He Long in November 1964 about ousting Mao was actually a carefully planned act of official policy. There is no evidence for this. In fact, drunken orgies were a common practice in the Soviet leadership ranks, so Malinovsky could well say rash things without any instructions. Indeed, if the Soviet leadership wanted to probe Zhou and He Long about removing Mao, why not do so privately, rather than in the presence of foreign diplomats, including those from Western countries. Furthermore, it was He Long who approached Malinovsky to make remarks, and not the other way around.<br /><br />Of course, there are many episodes that are still impossible to document properly. The verdict is out, but this book gives interesting interpretations.<br /><br />Regarding Lin Biao, the authors subscribe to the well-known version that the plane crashed in Mongolia because it ran out of fuel. This is one example of mysteries-still-to-be-solved. Indeed, a recently leaked document (investigation by the Mongolian KGB) concludes that the plane had plenty of fuel on board. This evidence was not available to the authors at the time of writing; it shows though that many of the arguments advanced in the book will be challenged and possibly overturned when new evidence emerges.<br /><br />Many reviewers have said that the book blames everything on Mao. That is true to some extent. Clearly, the authors emphasize the role of one man over the faults of the system. However, I feel the authors take a fairly bold line in condemning Zhou Enlai, whose \\"myth\\" is perhaps more wide-spead than the myth of Mao. Zhou, Liu Shaoqi and many other cronies willingly participated in Mao's purges. For some reason, Peng Dehuai is spared criticism in the book, as if he was the only saint in the leadership. Deng Xiaoping receives light treatment, too, though one might ask where he was in the late-1950s at the height of the economic mess? Did he not also advance Mao's foreign policy program rigidly, for example in Moscow in July 1963, where he was more outspoken against \\"revisionism\\" than even Kang Sheng?<br /><br />The amount of work that went into this book is simply colossal. It must be the best-researched book on Mao ever written, and it does offer a great deal of new scraps of evidence, though some of it comes from highly questionable sources such as \\"interviews with a Russian insider\\" (???). It is impressive how the authors were able to memorize (!) documents in the Chinese archives and then quote from them. The level of interviewees (presidents of different countries etc.) makes me wonder how the authors pulled this off. Overall, I am very impressed by this book. It is exceptionally well written.<br /><br />Are the arguments too far-fetched? It is hard to say. Almost every major and many minor claims of the book could be easily challenged as I showed above. And yet... The final words somehow ring true: \\"His [Mao's] mind remained lucid to the end, and in it stirred just one thought: himself and his power\\" (p. 616).<br /><br />I walked away with a mixed feeling about this book, but it sure made an impression.sting Mao was actually a carefully planned act of official policy.

0316018953|3.0|I love Harry Bosche novels. This one is the weakest. I guessed the wife was involved and found some aspects unbelievable such as the old torch being so easily lit between Harry and his ex-FBI flame. The clues didn't always stack up neatly when Harry began piecing the crime together, either. Many clues weren't plausible even when throughly explained.
B000LC55F2|5.0|this movie is very good. it is a little hard to follow but it is all explained in the end. the prestige is definitely better than The Illusionist. i just watched it the other night and it a little spooky but still awesome. if you don't see this movie you are missing out big time.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|Ah, finally, the progressive album that all us Dream Theater fans have been waiting for.  After getting mixed thoughts and reviews from Octavarium, I think DT realized it was time to knuckle down and get back to basics.  What's the result?  Systematic Chaos.  Keep in mind, this album is not a contiunation of anything, it's not Train of Thought II, it's nothing like Octavarium, it really does stand alone in terms of diversity and uniqueness.  Dream Theater took a step in a different direction for Systematic Chaos, it's not a concept album like Six Degrees or even Octavarium, it's not \\"balls to the wall\\" metal like Train of Thought was.  This album is progressive, heavy, melodic, and complex.  Everyone else has given a play by play of each and every song, so, I'll spare you my two cents as I agree with what everyone else has said.  I will say this though, some songs take a few listens to truly enjoy.  Repentance and Ministry of Lost Souls are truly masterpieces, and even if you don't like them the first time around, they're worth another shot.  Also, don't base the entire album off of \\"Constant Motion,\\" even though they chose that as their first single, it really is the weakest track on the album.  If you're a DT fan, you should really give this album a spin, especially if you were a little sour after Octavarium (like I know I was for a while).    Oh, on a side note, the documentary is hilarious and interesting (As you can see, the \\"Rock\\" track is all the way up, and the \\"Suck\\" and \\"Gay\\" tracks are actually completely off).  I wont ruin anything else for you, but, it's worth the extra money to watch Portnoy screw around in the studio.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|The three years that it was on the air, Veronica Mars was the best show out there with great dialogue and mostly great acting. The beginning of the third season was a bit weak and the entire season was plagued with too much relationship drama, but there were many high points too. In my opinion, the final episode alone is worth buying the whole season for; in fact, I thought it was the strongest season finale of the three (because it was more dialogue-based than action-based).
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Like many of you fans, I was also riding the \\"Train of Thought\\" when this album was released, and I expected more of the same.  However, I was shocked and appalled to find that this was most definitely not the case.  DT toned down from the bone-crushing riffs of \\"Honor Thy Father\\" to somber piano ballads like \\"The Answer Lies Within.\\"  The ripping, 32nd note solos of Rudess and Petrucci were replaced by the 'majesty' of whole notes and rests.  After a few listens, I threw the album down in disgust.  However, I soon picked it back up and played it over again.  It took a long time, but, this album has finally grown on me.  Once you appreciate the direction that DT went with Octavarium, you'll start to appreciate it for the multi-layered, progressive masterpiece it is.  I think the only song I still can't listen to on this album is \\"I Walk Beside You,\\" but that's just because it reminds me of U2, and I hate U2.  People are waaay too hard on this album, when it's not too difficult to get into.  \\"Panic Attack\\" has a great groove with a sweet bass line, and has very progressive tendencies.  \\"The Root of All Evil\\" is more like classic DT, although not nearly as heavy as anything from Train of Thought, it's still pretty metal.  \\"These Walls,\\" though very 'mainstream-ish,' is very melodic and has its moments.  \\"Never Enough\\" has a ripping synchronized keyboard and guitar solo.  \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" has some great solo work and the bridge has got some awesome odd-meter riffs.  \\"Octavarium\\" is just epic.  If you don't enjoy that song, you shouldn't consider yourself a DT fan.  Overall, if you've left Octavarium sitting on your shelf for a while and have neglected it even more since the release of Systematic Chaos, give it another chance.  You may find something you like.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I discovered the joys of Enya through my hairdresser! We were alone in the shop one night and suddenly she ran for a CD and put on this absolutely dreamy music (it happened to be Watermark, one of Enya's first albums). I was transported! It was haunting and evoked my strongest emotions--what artist had this power? She was aghast I had never heard of Enya since I'm in my mid-fifties. She said, oh, Enya has been around forever--don't you love her? YES. Her voice summons up Celtic forests and old mysteries best left unexplored, and of course, lost loves and massive emotional pain. But it's also strangely heartening. If you want to be moved to \\"another place,\\" then put Amarantine in your player and prepare to be whisked off to another land full of fairies and mist. Enya has certainly trumped herself with this stunning CD.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|From time to time the academy likes to recognize those movies which have advanced cinema as an art form. The lives of others is clearly one of these movies. It plucks at your emotions like a harp. It's themes are discrete, but those who can really appreciate the film could tell you not only that it is about pre-wall Germany, but also about humanity in general (love, hate, trust, corruption, friendship, privacy, and jealousy), and how an individual can change despite the most unwelcoming and adverse circumstances to thier new desired path.    This is a really beautiful film with so many meaningful subtleties whose genius could take your breath away. If you do watch it, be sure to watch out for ties- (not only the ones that are woven by relationships, but also those which hang from the neck's of the characters [who can tie them/wear them and what it means]. This is one of those brilliant movies which I believe only comes around every 20 years.
0679745653|5.0|I got this book because I love the movie, and now I can say I greatly appreciate the book also. It is always nice when a movie follows a book well and not make their own story and just use the title. But this is definitely a book i read again and again.

0618680004|4.0|Think about it! I remember that classic line from the movie Falling Down twenty years ago, starring Michael Douglas. And that's just what Dawkins is asking the average man in the street to do.<br /><br />He asks the reader to think about it, from the opening preface, when he states without religion we wouldn't have suicide bombers, crusades, no witch hunts, no gunpowder plot, no Indian Partition, no Iraeli/ Palestinian wars no Serb/ Croat massacres, no persecution of Jews as Christ killers, no NI troubles, no delibrate unecessary mutilation of male and female genitals, no honour killings, no Taliban, no public beheadings of blasphemers, no flogging of the female skin for daring to show an inch of it and arguably best of the lot no televangelists.<br /><br />Think about the worlds' best selling book by far - The Bible. Whether an atheist an evangelist a priest or a Rabbi one thing that everyone agrees with is that the errr... good book is something by which the practicing religious among us class it as just that- A good book, a book by which we should lead our lives based upon the morals and principles contained within the scriptures. Right? Well...actually no thank you. What Dawkins points out is that the good book and in particular the Old Testament is littered with appalling immoral acts either condoned or ordered by God, Moses and Abraham including murder, mass murder, genocide, ethnic cleansing, gang rape, rape and child rape. I kid you not, its in there, read it for yourselves. When Moses army massacred the Midianites he also gave orders to massacre the women who were not virgins. He then instructed his troops \\"But all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves'.\\"<br /><br />Dawkins book begs the question again and again why are people so hung up on the teachings of undefined authors and scriptures written so long ago. Why haven't we evolved on a religious front as we have evolved in literally everything else. Whether you believe in a God or not, you must answer that question.<br /><br />Don't worry, this book isn't an anti Christian rant, he lets every religion have it with both blazing barrels.

I wanted more when he analysed certain writings from the Bible, I wanted a little more on the Koran. But all in all the book is thought provoking and will stimulate many an argument across a dinner table or restaurant.

B00005JLCI|5.0|This is the only true Hamlet on film, all others are fraudulent!  Only when the whole story is told can it have the full meaning and this film accomplishes that with grand splendor! Word for word it portrays everything that is told in the play without missing a beat.  All others change or cut the story to suit their needs and/or time constraints.  This does it justice and gives the viewer the experience that I'm sure would have exceeded Shakespeare's desires.
