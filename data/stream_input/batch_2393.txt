B001NLKWLW|5.0|A romantic mystery of the best kind. Wonderfully well-written, realistic characters and a well-crafted plot. I couldn't put it down.
B000002J1Y|5.0|Yes, Yessongs sets the standard for all yes songs.  Yes has always been one to push the envelope of the envelope and really, this album startd it all.
B004LROUNG|5.0|One of the best by John Grisham! Humorous!  Easy to visualize each of the characters. Would make a terrific movie.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Full Facebook Free locks up my phone instantly every time it's opened so this is the only application for Facebook I'll use. My only issue is all the alerts I haven't quite learned how to silence them yet.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Even though it does increase the size of the XL, the Circle Pad Pro is worth it. Great for games that can make use of the additional joystick.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Every time I used this app it instantly freezes phone requiring me to shut down & restart.<br /><br />Samsung Stratosphere I
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Great game to have on long airline trips or anywhere that you have to sit and wait for long periods.  Playing a round is fun, keeps your mind occupied and isn't overly taxing to the brain.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This classic is best read in its orginial form.  Disney and Broadway versions abound, but this is the best to read.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I recommend this product to anyone who travels with their Kindle fire and use it regularly.  The cover is lightweight but protective.  It's also much easier to open, close and bend than prior covers I've used.  The elastic band in the front is a convenient place for me to hook my stylus to.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Gave this as a gift to a girlfriend who is now a BIG FAN of this show. Since she only got hooked in the 3 season, she is now playing catch-up, and loving it.
B00BW6SOIQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I will probably watch it again. Some BDSM scenes were hot. Definitely gave my husband some ideas!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome! Have read it three times! I could read it over and over again! A must read for teens and adults!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I laughed the entire movie! My husband didn't believe it could be that funny but he was convinced by the end. This was a hilarious reflection on the interactions between my family members.
0812974786|4.0|I bought this book for my daughter. She needed it for her H.S. Literature class. I had already read Siddhartha many years before and was not a huge fan.<br />I still wouldn't rate it as my favorite book of all time, but I enjoyed it to a greater extent this time. Part of the reason for that was the Introduction of this particular version. The other reason was the translation.<br />If you're going to buy the book Siddhartha, I highly recommend this particular version. I am told that the various translations of Siddhartha are quite different and many people prefer this particular translation.<br />I must also say that I normally skip reading the Introduction of books, because when I do read the Introduction, it's boring & worthless. However, I decided to read the Introduction to Siddhartha and am glad I did. It was the best part of the whole book. It was actually entertaining and very well written. So to summarize:<br />a. If you're going to read Siddhartha, read this version.<br />b. The Introduction to this particular version of Siddhartha should win the &#34;best introduction ever&#34; award.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Super funny movie. My 14 yr old is obsessed with this movie and my husband and I laughed throughout the entire movie.
B0058YPGSY|1.0|\\"Sons Of Anarchy: Season Four\\"<br />NOTE: Mild spoilers below. Don't freak out.<br /><br />On its own, this season of SOA would probably get a 4-star rating: the first few episodes were hard to get into and the entire subplot about Juice being afraid of being \\"outed\\" as an African-American simply didn't ring true: the Sons spent their first two seasons combating the local white supremacist gang, and had expressed a dislike of their ideology. Now, suddenly, they're all racist themselves and Juice is so flipped out about it that he's willing to rat them out to the Feds? Sorry -- I don't buy it. It was way too forced and didn't serve that great a dramatic purpose. Meanwhile, Jax is still wringing his hands about what to do with his life and is still spinning around in the same should-I-stay-or-should-I-go? circles he's been running in for the entire show.  I know this is meant to be a Hamlet parallel, but it's starting to wear thin.  Also, the new Top Cop character was a little too \\"quirky\\" for my tastes. Still, by the time the second half of the season rolled around, we were transfixed, and wanted to see what was going to happen next. The last couple of episodes were sharp enough to make us eager to see what happens next.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving the show a 1-star rating, though, is as a protest vote against Amazon's new monopolistic sales policies, in which they are colluding with HBO, Fox and other companies to forbid Amazon customers from reselling their DVDs on Amazon: you can buy \\"Sons Of Anarchy\\" on Amazon, but if you try to sell it used, suddenly it's a \\"restricted item\\" and they won't let you. What's worse is they will allow *some* Amazon-affiliated sellers to provide it used, but not regular folks like you and me. The idea is, apparently, to crack down on bootlegs as well as artificially boost the used prices and, I would imagine, to push more customers towards Amazon's vastly inferior download and streaming video services, so that the video companiesdon't \\"lose\\" more money through re-sales. Well, since I bought this show brand new, directly from Amazon, I don't think it's a bootleg, and I think that I should be able to resell it there as well, as I've always been able to before. Now, if Amazon wanted to stop ALL used sales on their site altogether, that would be one thing, but playing favorites with \\"pre-approved\\" sellers seems pretty unfair and smells a bit like monopoly practices to me. Just one more reason to migrate away from Amazon's sphere of influence, I guess. I really don't like the high-handed way Amazon is treating its customers these days. (Axton)
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|&#34;Emma&#34; is one of the most perfectly constructed of the classic novels. It is a dramatic and emotionally charged portrait of a girl who thinks too well of herself.  Who is &#34;handsome, clever, and rich' and interferes in the lives of others, but is brought to a realisation of the misery this causes when she falls in love with one, who she thinks is already promised to another, but she cannot do anything to stop the inappropriate liaison.
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|My family loved this movie, there were some scary parts so little kids beware! LOVE is a big theme here, great message & alot of action.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I had good expectations for The Hobbit based on memories of the &#34;Ring&#34; trilogy of films.<br />Those expectations started to fade early, as the narration droned on and on and on for events that I felt could easily be shown by action and acting instead.<br />Once the 'action' started it moved at a plodding pace. When things finally got going, sometimes I was taken out of it by the ridiculous circumstances, like the huge subterranean, cavernous, rickety, Rube Goldberg constructions. They seemed designed to cause great harm to anyone foolish enough to set foot on them.<br />The scenes with Gollum were enjoyable, but didn't relate to the over-all plot much.<br />I was left with little anticipation for the following films.
B0086700CM|1.0|recently got this app for my ascend and needless to say it does not support this game.  no offense to temple run, its just my sorry phone
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|this song is great with very good singing, guitar, and electronic beats put together by daft punk its good to here from then since its been about 10 years
B00A757EFW|1.0|i downloaded this app to my phone, and then tried to play it.  it tells me my amazon needs updating, so i did that and it still won't work...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was one of the best games I ever played. It was so intense to played. I hated to set it down. Can't wait to try another one. Couldn't wait to share with my friends.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie was produced well and was inline with the events that took place during what is known as the &#34;Canadian Caper&#34;. I do agree that they did not make full use of the supporting actors, i.e. John Goodman and Victor Garber. The only other details they left out was that the escapees didn't just leave the day after showing up in a bazaar in the middle of town. They should have taken another half hour to go in a little more detail of when Mendez landed in Iran to how he actually got them out.<br /><br />Otherwise, I think with the time of the movie, they developed the details with a good intro into the events leading to the hostage situation, playing out the hostage situation and how to get the 6 out. The day of escape left me at the edge of my seat. The only implausible event was how the Iranians didn't figure out what was going on underneath their noses.
B000FA675C|3.0|Historical fiction as a genre can be interesting as is &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34;. The book itself is a reasonably breezy read yet problematic in two respects. First the story contains a rapid succession of twists jumping from one thing to another seemingly for the purpose of disguising its predictability and unbelievable protagonist escapes. Second, as historical fiction the story asserts authority with regard to real, actual historical facts that are for the most part, made up. Mixing and matching historical figures and geographic locations with fantasy is troublesome because, as the initial release of this book illustrated many years ago, it becomes a version of history and contributes to making us all dumber. The author's list of &#34;facts&#34; at the front of the book further contributes to making us all dumber by again asserting authority by associating the real with the fiction in the actual book.
B004UHL9EK|2.0|UPDATE:  MP3 option does work but only for the timer mode and not for the alarm mode.  Because it partly works but not in the alarm mode which is what I am looking for, I am going to increase my rating to 2 stars until the app developer fixes the alarm mode to work with your own MP3 files too.<br /><br />Today's free app of the day from Amazon is Timers4Me & Stopwatch Pro.  This should have been a 5 star review but because of the lack of a key feature, this is only going to get 1 star from me because that key feature is like the most important feature I was looking for.  So this is an extremely frustrating review to write which requires a rather long backstory.<br /><br />Last year, Amazon offered Bedside Alarm Clock as a free app of the day.  It was a great app because it allowed you to play your own mp3 files on your device as the alarm sound.  It worked for several months until the end of Daylight Savings Time occurred in November of last year.  From that point on the app would  often have the alarm go off at the wrong time or not at all making the app way too unreliable for me to use anymore.<br /><br />So I had to find another app with an alarm feature.  So I started using PolyClock which was another app I got as a free app of the day last year.  The main downside to using the alarm feature on that app is that you had to use one of the pre-programmed sounds.  There was no option to use mp3 music files on that app.<br /><br />So today when I saw and read the description for Timers4Me & Stopwatch Pro, I was glad to see that there was support for using your own mp3 music files in the app's description.<br /><br />I downloaded the app and opened it.  I looked all around and tried the Preferences tab like another reviewer suggested to find the feature I was looking for, and the best I could find is an option labeled My ringtone under Select Ringtone, but that option only opens a list of other apps such as Quickoffice.  I tried selecting the music file through Quickoffice, but when the alarm goes off it plays the default ringtone instead of the file selected.<br /><br />Because that was the main thing I was wanting in an alarm app like this and the feature does not seem to be supported like they suggested and because the app has frozen up on a few occasions since testing it out, I have no choice but to give this only 1 star out of 5.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars had this feature really been implemented like they claimed and if the app didn't have issues with being unresponsive at times.  I am hoping the app developer will be able to fix these shortcomings very soon so I can raise my review from 1 star to something higher.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Great actors and inspiring story line. Enjoyed seeing a different take on retirement and risk taking. A quick peek into another culture.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|A really good read! I enjoyed the descriptive writing and the interesting cast of characters.  I will recommend this book to anyone who likes a psychological thriller.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Beautifully acted, singing and singers were superb, casting for all parts performed 100%. Loved this movie when viewing @ theater, so now I can enjoy it in home.  Movie flowed well and keeps the viewers interest. Victor Hugo was right on when he wrote Les Miserables. For anyone enjoying opera/theater this should be a winner for them.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|I guess who ever wrote this must only know one work...f**k...if they said it once they said it a million times. They also have kids in this movie using the same words. I want my money back and the two hours I wasted watching it...
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A wonderful book to get lost in while riding public transportation, by the beach, the pool or anywhere.  The classics are a great way to lose yourself in a good book.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|After losing my Macbook Air charger and realizing that we have three functioning Pro chargers, I decided this would be a better bang for the buck than a brand new Air charger.  It looks a bit funky, but works perfectly.  Especially for the price (compare this to the price of a full charger!), this is an excellent purchase.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I am a late starter, but I really enjoy the classics and being able to read them whenever I want.
B003Z39G0O|1.0|The music is weird and not what I was expecting, I was expecting actual music they play on the show and was sorely disappointed.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Love this game. Kinda like an alternative bridge builder game. You have to make geometric contraptions like bridges or towers to reach certain heights or cross over obstacles.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|IF you are a fan of the movie then you NEED to get this cd. It is all the cast singing their songs from the movie minus some of the short ones.
0316069884|5.0|I wish I could force every person in the world to read this book. I have never been so profoundly changed by information combined with philosophy--I have been succesful in getting a few people to read it, all of them have thanked me with all their heart for suggesting it (as strongly and repetitively as I did). Any angry reviewer here either has not read the book or is completely deficient of common sense.<br /><br />Safran Foer could not be more calm, measured, compassionate and unflinching in his exploration of the human story of animal consumption and what it has come to look like in our modern society. I'm so thankful that he addressed, a couple of times in the book, Pollan's OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA--a book I wish I could say the same things about. Where Pollan addresses his uneasiness around slaughter and then looks away, Safran Foer delves deeper. When Pollan accuses vegetarians of a naive and arrogant false moral purity, Safran Foer poses some counter questions that are not easily answered. (Incidentally, I was saddened to see a big dish of chicken at the center of Michael \\"use meat sparingly and for flavoring\\" Pollan's table in a recent O Magazine feature. If you don't even follow your own advice, what does that say about the depth of your philosophical conclusions?)<br /><br />It is important to understand that ultimately, this book makes a case violently against factory farming, but not necessarily eating animals--similar to OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA, but with even greater depth of thought and compassion. Safran Foer may have chosen vegetarianism for his own reasons, but go look at BuyingPoultry.com and see who's endorsing responsible animal farming and meat buying on the home page.<br /><br />In terms of reading quality--I am constantly searching for and rarely finding books that leave me this riveted. It is up-until-3-AM-sitting-in-cold-bathwater engrossing. I am so impressed by the pure excellence of writing that Safran Foer's novels now sit at the top of my to-be-read list.<br /><br />If you enjoy a good challenge to your assumptions and don't shy away from the gray area of life--and most readers, I think, hope to be such--this is a book for you. This is a book for every human who cares about holding on to your humanity. Ostensibly, you may finish this book as a new vegetarian or even more selective omnivore, but I dare you to read it and continue to send money to factory farms.<br /><br />The need for this information to be understood by all is dire, and the time to read this book is now.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Thank you so much!!! My autistic son turned 11 on 11 April. This was my first purchase with amazon so I paid the standard postage and got an approximate delivery date of 29 April so it would be well after his birthday. Imagine my surprise, joy, shock when it came nearly 3 weeks earlier than expected!! I was more excited than him!! So I wrapped it up and stashed it! On his birthday he ripped each corner of his presents, he knew what he wanted and I knew what he was looking for! Thank you soooooo much Amazon for making my little boys birthday that extra special! I was so happy that I ordered him 2 more disney Pixar collected edition titles from Amazon and paid priority shipping and they still arrived before they were expected. Very happy and satisfied customer:))
B005LAII94|4.0|I watched the unrated version and it had some hardcore violence not for the faint at heart.  I really thought this was going to be a drug dealer movie but that was not the case.  It is about the cartel tying to get into business with 2 independent producers who share the same girlfriend and the cartel kidnaps her in order to get them to follow instructions.  The real movie plot is how far will these guys go to get their girlfriend back.  John Travolta plays his role since Pulp Fiction and I really enjoyed the ruthlessness of Selma Hayak as the cartel head.  This unrated version was about 10 minutes too long in my opinion and not to give away the movie I was not a fan of the end.  All in all this is well done movie, good plot, nice soundtrack (really liked the psycho killer version)and a top notch cast.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Very good book, didn't expect the twist at end, made me breathe in deep.....on to the next book, The Guardian, heard I was amazing too!!
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|i like it but i have not read it all yet.when i finish it i bet i would have liked it.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Horrible.. Looks like it will be cute and funny but it didn't work at all. Or I just could never figure it out - which is horrible in itself. I never once could get him to repeat what I said, even tried screaming into the mic.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Most levels have several minutes of replayability: an initial try (or a few) to succeed the first time, then a few tries to solve as fast as possible for a better score.<br /><br />Familiar cut the rope puzzles with a few new puzzle aspects that keep this familiar but fresh.<br /><br />New &quot;age&quot; backgrounds and characters for each set of levels keeps things changing and leaves room for more with updates.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Great for managing my page away from my regular facebook profile. I no longer get confused as to which account I'm posting from.
0007250924|5.0|Absolutely wonderful.  This book is a gem for the medical professional as well as the layman with an interest in the intersection of medicine, science, public policy and big business.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've had this app and have had no problems. and the last permission came with a new and improved version that's even better than the first one. it's accurate. and it's free.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I learned so much from this book.  I thought I knew a lot about food and ate very healthy but this book was a real eye opener.  I will never go into a grocery store again without being more mindful of the things that the food industry can put into our food including those items on the outside walls such as milk products, meats, etc.  As I read the book, I was reminded of how I grew up eating 3 sitdown meals per day, no snacks, little cheese, and lots of fruits and veggies from our backyard.  Times have changed.
B00005J79J|5.0|Great collection of all Sarah's best recordings for your listening pleasure. Highly recommend this CD, as you won't be disappointed.
B006MPKAOI|5.0|It's been a long time since I was unable to put a book down! It's so refreshing to stumble upon a new author and enjoy their work so much.<br />Will be following up on her others now! For followers of Tess Gerritsen, you will love this author too!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|this was a gift and the person we gave it to loved it. He loves this seriesso he was thrilled to be able to start collecting the show.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Really like the game.it builds fast and you don't have to wait long to complete the goals.the only downfall is not knowing how much it is to upgrade your buildings.you keep hitting upgrade and it comes back with not enough money.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|this is a great first season to a series that we all enjoy. The price is great especially considering you get a whole season.
1609611543|3.0|I have not finished the book yet. It seems to be useful and medically accurate, but reading is less than exciting. I have recommended this book to my daughter, so I do think it is important to purchase and read. Maybe my attention span is a little shorter than it should be? I just wish it read more like a Mike Hammer mystery.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it was really fun the graphics are great so was all the games and activities it was awesome especially. all the games were fun.
B007EDYN36|5.0|Peter is brutally honest in only the way that former drug addicts are. He seems to have come to grips with himself the good, the not so good, the bad, and the terrible. He writes about things that most would keep very private.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book so much that I read it twice since it's overloaded with the experiences that have made up his life. It reads so genuinely that you really feel like you know him when it's finished. His battles are inspiring especially his openness about male breast cancer, his addictions, his family, his life and his faith. He also doesn't talk down to you and doesn't read as being arrogant.<br /><br />I truly loved this book. It really exceeded my expectations.
B0063IH60K|5.0|addicting to play. it's all ive doing for the past couple of days. just like on my computer lol.  you'll have fun playing it
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love this artist. Songs have dance/techno like music, nice voice overs, amazing violin chords and a mix of slow/up-beat music. You gonna like this album!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good story line, but slow paced. The movie begins with chilling sounds of the tragedy on 9-11. The torture scenes are a bit brutal. And although we all know the ending the suspense was encapsulating.
B000002LGA|5.0|Just listened to this album straight through after some years. It has lost none of its vibrancy since the late eighties. It is so freakin good! The guitar work is bright and lively and the lyrics are just amazing. Such a good album. I highly recommend it!
030758836X|5.0|After the stunning debut and an ok follow up, the author is back to being at her best. This is an unpredictable tale of hatred that wears the mask of love. It also is the praise of the familiar- better to be in a toxic relationship than risk starting a new one.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|Whether I am on my computer or just have my smartphone, I have my most current to-do list.  It also keeps my notes for each item handy. The simplicity is the strongest feature. Just what I was looking for.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I came onto this product page with every intention of buying Oz the Great and Powerful (3D Blu-ray + 2D Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy), seeing as nearly every single movie in 3D offers this option when it is about to be released on BR (for the people who are not interested in 3D, other options - BR/DVD/Digital Copy, or BR/DVD, or DVD - are usually available).<br /><br />And what do I find?<br /><br />Either I buy:<br />(1) 3D BR/Digital Copy for 31.32 approx, as of 4/22, or<br />(2) 2D BR/DVD/Digital Copy for 31.49 approx. as of 4/22<br /><br />If I wanted the version I came looking for (which, from what I've seen, is what most people interested in the 3D option purchase), then I would have to buy both (1) and (2), putting my purchase at nearly 63 USD.<br /><br />Instead, what I will do is spend 0.0 USD, and rent this movie when it comes out.<br /><br />So, Disney, congratulations on losing a sale due to greed.<br /><br />I suspect this is not the only sale you will be losing out on.
B00B23O96A|5.0|I LIKE ERIC CLAPTON  THIS HAS GOOD MUSIC AND CHOICE OF SONGS<br /><br />RECOMMEND TO ALL THE ERIC FANS OUT THERE
B000NY12CI|5.0|After a woman in a doctor's office recommended this book, I could tell it made an impact on her world view--as it did mine after I read it.  I found it engaging and at the same time, disconcerting.  As Americans, we are tolerant and accepting of all beliefs, and yet our liberal acceptance is also a form of ignorance about the dark side of other religions. Spoken from a woman who has lived it, Infidel is an eye-opener into a primitive belief system that should be approached warily.
B00422LESO|5.0|I loved this book so much that I wanted to figure out why my wife loved Jane Austen so much.  Very fun & romantic that this GUY enjoyed very much.
0385349947|5.0|Before I knew it, I was dog-earring every page because they were all speaking to me so much.  As a young woman moving up the corporate latter, I loved the content.  I really appreciate this book and will be referring back to it often for motivation and encouragement.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I heard good reviews and thought it would be really funny.  It was ok.  A little too much whinning going on.  Paul Rudd is getting so typed cast.  It just wasn't an interesting view of what 40 looks like.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|Ms. Spalding continues to impress.  She has style and beauty and her singing and playing are simply lovely.  I can't get enough of her music
B004LE7PCM|5.0|As the title goes, this is a complete collection of Sherlock Holmes novels by the great Conan Doyle. An excellent addition to any Kindle library especially if you happen to be a fan of detective stories and the like.
1781163243|5.0|Grandson loved this book illustrations are awesome . big must for Halo fans who like the art of the Halo game
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Be warned, you will listen to the album over and over and over with no side effect of regret. Ryan and Ben combine their talents to create some of the best home-grown art you'll ever enjoy. Best enjoyed while raising your voice and your hands and letting the infectious tones take over your body.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just a few days in and it's kept my attention. Little annoyed by the force close and I'm not on FB so how do I get friends? Other than that I'm having fun.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Clear and easy to understand.  Works great!  Measures battery status and makes it easy for my kids to know when it needs to be charged.  Love the detailed life expectancy by type of use, i.e. web browsing, movies, music.

073937771X|5.0|I read all three books in this trilogy, I had to read the first three chapters of the first book twice, its about banking and high finance and was a little hard for me to follow, but so worth it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Top-flight entertainment!  No problems with the quality of the DVDs.  This is great sci-fi, wish they had been able to do more seasons.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great read. Can't wait for the next Vince Flynn book. Flynn keeps things moving along at every flip of the page.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|I've been listening to this album almost non-stop since I bought it.  It's great accompaniment for road trips, and if you play it at home, you will NOT be able to hold still.  Another virtuoso performance, and a stunning mix of modern and classical.  Just beautiful.  I still marvel that a violin can be played to such perfection and can be made to have as much expression as a human voice.  If you have not been introduced yet to David Garrett's music, this CD will be a revelation.
B0010T0OCY|1.0|Never got to watch the movie. Would not stream. Would start to load, then stop at 1/4 of the load, then stop. Nothing showed to say there was a problem. I tried several times and it would repeat the same behavior. Was very frustrating.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The sound and picture quality are outstanding.  My wife has already watched it multiple times.  I highly recommend this movie.
0802473156|5.0|This book has a lot of insightful information. Good for partners who are struggling or not. Will make your relationships stronger.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|As many have already said, this is a fantastic movie-musical.  It's not for little children--too much blood and thematic content. It's also not for those who hate musicals. If you don't fall into those categories, expect a wonderfully moving story.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I have been using this for a long time on my phone and just added it to my fire. i wish I could sync the two devices.
B009X01C64|5.0|works good. My husband waid it was what he needed. I don't like having to write these reviews because I don't know what to write.h
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It is a lot of fun and the graphics are very good on my phone and my Fire. Get it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|i feel like im back in the 80's playing this game lol just plain fun to make the time go by.
B007REV4YI|5.0|bond at his best and old school feel to the movie with all the feel of a modern movie experience in blu-ray.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|Technically excellent - video quality, sound, etc. However the story has been adulterated so much that it is barely recognizable as The Hobbit as written by Tolkein presumably to stretch it into three episodes for pecuniary reasons. Very disappointing considering the excellent Lord Of The Rings trilogy.
0451197968|3.0|DO NOT under any cicrumstances, read the intro \\"The Importance of being Bachman\\" before reading this book. Apparently Stephen King has so little respect for endings (lets face it, half of his books have poor endings) that he just decided to cavalierly reveal this book's ending. This took all the fun out of the last third of the book, since I probably wouldn't have seen it coming. Ridiculous.<br /><br />Otherwise, the book is interesting (though depressing) and an absolutely different entity than the movie.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This was a compliment to book 1. I often find second books struggle a bit. This did not I would recommend.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I watched this with someone who NEVER saw the film before-- the twisted and disturbing plot at the end is still as potent as ever 50+ later.  A Hitchcock masterpiece.
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|Did not like this movie. Not what I expected from Helen Hunt. Would not recommend to a friend. The previews were misleading.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I like the format. The tiles are easy to read. I like the pace. Too fast, you lose me. Too slow.. same thing.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|The writer had great insight to today's young married couples. Loved it and will recommend it to all my friends
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Good:<br />Fun<br />Easy read<br />Great main character<br /><br />Bad:<br />Linear story<br />A bit too easy to read (almost young adult category)<br />Poor dialog & secondary characters<br /><br />So a co-worker suggested I read The Martian (he actually gave it higher marks the Wool).  Even though I had already bought Wool, I figured for 99 cents, why not?  Perhaps he set my expectations too high, but while this is a decent book it's not a great book.  Don't get me wrong, this is a real fun & enjoyable read.  But it's kinda like drinking soda- sure it tastes good, but it's just empty calories.  Perhaps I'm being a bit too critical, but I had just finished Old Man's War and I'm now reading Wool, and while I enjoyed The Martian, it doesn't stack up well to either of these.<br /><br />The main character is well done and the reader spends most of our time reading his journal as he attempts to survive and get off of Mars.  I found myself relating very closely to him which definitely enhanced my enjoyment.  If you don't have a dry/sarcastic sense of humor you might not enjoy it quite as much.  Unfortunately, the other characters in the novel are very one dimensional and their dialog is overly simplistic.  Unlike most of the sci-fi I've been reading lately, there really isn't any deeper message, nor does the author challenge the reader- there really aren't any underlying big messages to think about when you're done with the final page.<br /><br />If I were feeling more generous, I'd give it 4 stars because it's only 99 cents and really a great deal, but I'm about 60% through Wool which is such a far better book, that I just can't make myself do that.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Awesome book.  Dr. Alexander certainly didn't have anything to gain by telling his truth, knowing so many in his own profession would doubt.  It is a miracle that he recovered -- fully!  Once upon a time I had my own doubts when it came to religion, spirituality, afterlife, etc.  This story seemed to resonate with me and truly believe all he related to us with this book.  I'm glad he wrote the book because it answered so many questions for me.  One more in my journey.  If you're a seeker, you must read this book.
0395389496|5.0|My mother reads this to them all the time. She leaves it at my sister's and when she babysits, she reads this story to them at night. Thank you!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This album is excellent, but I primarily want to use this review to comment on the tossers that like to cast a wet blanket over the proceedings with their \\"I need to get a life\\" dissertations on how the band has fallen (which they haven't). BTW, Playing the Angel (which kicks ass) and Sounds of the Universe were Grammy-nominated-just a little rebuttal to those \\"fans\\" who keep bitching about them. With Angel in particular, many critics noted how fresh and creative it was, which few bands deliver that far into their careers. Their creativity and excellent showmanship continue to amaze. For those DM has fallen from grace post Wilder comments, what a load of bullocks, indeed! I've been a DM-aholic since the 6th grade (1986), and they've never disappointed me. Yes, as with any band, DM did have a golden period wherein all the stars aligned which would be from 1984-1994. I'm as big an Alan Wilder fan as anyone. I've always appreciated his musical talent/sensibilities and his elegant, soft-spoken style. In many ways, I identify as much with his elegance as I do with Gahan's charisma. However, to say that DM was the sole vision of Wilder is utter nonsense and as some have noted, Wilder himself would find such a comment ridiculous. I appreciate Recoil and have most of those albums. I've also seen Recoil live. A big difference between Recoil and DM is that Recoil is what I would term a \\"project\\" while DM is what I would term a \\"band.\\" Alan Wilder creates music without making any concession to album sales or touring. As evidenced by the Recoil tour, his music is created in a manner that cannot be replicated live. He is excellent at creating atmosphere but even he would admit that Gore is one of the greatest songwriter (and has admitted this on many an occasion which would undercut your point about Gore being a simplistic, redundant songwriter). You seem to be basing your point about Wilder being the visionary based on the anecdote about Gore's harmonium demo for Enjoy the Silence as well as the band noting that Alan was the studio perfectionist who would obsess over sounds more than the other members would. However, your argument is undercut by the fact that we don't know for sure who created what in the studio in terms of sounds, melodies, and beats. Gore was very involved in the creative process: he created the chiming guitar notes in the People are People outro stomp plucking his guitar with a German coin. Gore created that signature compressed guitar note from Never Let Me Down Again. I point these out because you make it seem like Gore wrote the lyrics and created the demos, which isn't easy to do by the way, and then he just left the rest of the process to Wilder! Interestingly, Music for the Masses, which is regarded as one of the most textured Mode albums that broke them to an even higher plateau in the US and globally, is an album where the members have noted that Gore's demos for the songs were very detailed and sophisticated and that the resulting songs did not stray that far from Gore's demos. This would seem to invalidate your over the top comments about Wilder being the chief visionary. All told, every band has their moment in the sun and then they either fade away or continue to prove their durability. Depeche Mode, in my opinion, still create music that is both challenging yet also can be played live. I love their post-Alan Wilder and their live shows still reduce me to a giddy schoolboy. I'm grateful that 3 decades on and in their 50s, they are still able to deliver. Now, we come to your assessment that they don't deliver anymore to which I would ask, Why do you still listen to the band and feel so passionate about them that you offer a PhD like dissertation on how they have fallen? If you truly feel Alan was the sole visionary, then why do you keep listening to DM once he has left the fold? Why not just move on and focus on listening to and commenting on bands that bring you fulfillment? I honestly think a lot of thosepeople that go on and on bitching about the same old thing actually find pleasure in disappointment. Long live the masochist! As Gahan joked about Playing the Angel, \\"the themes on this album are pain and more pain...because life is painful.\\" It seems the \\"minority\\" group of Wilder syncophants (the classy Wilder doesn't need your endorsements, BTW) live by these words.

B009YU6FJM|5.0|This album was all kinds of awesome. Every song is amazing I'm it's own way. Deftones never let me down. This album is perfect for a midnight road trip. I get lost in this album everytime.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|The events, as described in the book, resemble another author's telling of the tale in &#34;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&#34; - although differently described, the 'proof of the pudding' was already laid out in these chronicles. A long time ago, there was another account of 'heaven' in &#34;From the Turret&#34; by Peter Richelieu which was the book that actually put me on my 'path' of investigating spirituality.<br /><br />&#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; was well written and because Dr. Alexander didn't try to 'convert' people to his belief system, it came across as genuine. However, it more or less confirmed exactly what I already believed! So, in essence,well done!
B000TEMRO4|5.0|This greatest hits album is really a great compilation of Blondie's best hits from the seventies and eighties, unlike other greatest hits albums this one has no song that you regret being included. I highly recommend this one to fans of Debbie Harry.
B00136NUG6|5.0|I've been listenin to earth wind and fire since I was 16 they are the best that ever lived !
B0013GLE4Q|5.0|I recommend this album to any one that loves rock and roll and female artist's that really can belt out a tune.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|They did a great job of adapting this book into a film. The acting was wonderful...especially Jennifer Lawrence, and the other main characters. I am excited for the next movie!
B005VPSEK2|5.0|This album is really great, Kelly is going to be a force in rock and country for a long time to come she has produced so many great songs and her voice is so beautiful and full of feeling , and this album is no exception. I highly recommend this to all fans of Kelly Clarkson.
B009PAETCG|5.0|for free you cant ask for much more good gameplay. odd that it asks you to pick a country then you never see it again. saw this on a club's site but cant find that version.
B00330UFQS|5.0|Every song on this album has a meaning to me I love it they are singing about my life I swear! Get this one folks.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Although the movie is long and starts slow for some I feel the length is necessary for us to fall in love with the dwarves and Bilbo.  The movie stays true to the overall story and theme of the book.  I wish it was not going to be in three separate movies but I will get over that.  There are the breath taking sweeping scenes we come to expect from Peter Jackson.  Intense story lines and fun characters.  I recommend this movie to Tolkien lovers and movie lovers alike.
B005LAJ23A|3.0|Don't get me wrong. For the most part, I enjoy this series, but the best thing about watching the videos is that you can fast forward when you feel the talkfests are coming on.  Some of them are interminable. The story just stops dead in its tracks, and these scenes are totally expendable.<br /><br /> Too bad they didn't make the Shane character more likeable. Eventually, you find yourself looking forward to his biting the big one, one way or another. How much more interesting it would have been to have made him a more sympathetic character, instead of the sleeze ball he turned out to be. The old guy named Hershel is another one who's grating on the nerves. His tone of voice is pretty annoying. Too bad he survives all three seasons. And don't get me started on Andrea. Another annoying, totally unlikable character made worse by the mugging actress who plays her.
0618154051|5.0|Excellent condition. I love any sort of Tolkien book, so I can't wait to dive in! We need more Tolkien fans.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Monster high is so awesome. It lets girls know that they all don't have to look perfect to have love in their lives.
B0081L391C|5.0|I rarely if ever watched the actual show but this comedy made me double think that. So good I watched it twice.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|buy this game because there is cool towers like the super monkey!<br />so buy this game because its cool so buy it now!
B00AN93Q0O|3.0|I heard a song by twenty one pilots called &#34;holding on to you&#34; and I thought I would buy their album right away. I wish I would have waited. All though the songs are extremely well put together and the lyricists has a pretty solid voice sometimes the songs can get a little depressing and that never helps in the middle of a gym session.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I loved the game up until it restarted me at level 78 twice! So frustrating because of the time and money spent on building up settlement. I won't play it anymore :(
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I don't know if that's how you spell his name. I fell asleep during this twice but Sasha you did it again.
B008Y7DWC4|3.0|The picture and sound were great the movie not so much. It is just a movie still gotta love Sam Raimi.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|It's a good watch and keeps good time but these automatic type watches are supposed to keep time for around two weeks after you take them off. Well, this one doesn't keep it for two days.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Ended up buying gems. Can't believe how my son and I compete on different kindles so we see who can grow the fastest. Great graphics, tributes to Jaws movie, entertaining and addictive.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Out of boredom and because I have heard so much about it, I decided to give it a try. Not regretting it. I love the way is written, I love that everything happens at the same and from different points of views. I seriously haven't read something this exciting in a long time.
0307744434|3.0|I just did not understand this book. So dry, especially in character development. And way too weird, and not in a good way. Read at your own risk.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|I have 6 of the earliest JA albums and this by far is my favorite! It gets you from the first time you hear it and it doesn't stop until the end - every song, even the bonus tracks.<br /><br />One of the top classic albums of all time. Love it!
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|Loves this movie when I saw it in the theater. Love it on blu ray. Very glad I made this purchase
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|We loved this movie.  If you are a Tokien fan, you will want to own this movie.  The price was unmatched.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|This is the album that started it all for L.Cohen. This is a must to have. Talented man and poet
B00021HBGS|5.0|My daughter loves this set.  There are a ton of pieces!  She uses it quite a bit.  The parts are well made.
B000EXZI0A|5.0|Every song of the ramones is a great hit and this is a good album to listen too if you want to get in their music. Cant beat the prices. Gaba Gaba hey!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Is easy to read without having my big book with me and I can change the version too. I love it.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I have two Kindle accounts and once I loaded this on my tablet, I was beholden to use the one account and couldn't access the other account.  There is no way to log out of the app once downloaded.
B0007TKNII|4.0|I bought it for my five year old grandson. He really likes it and watches it often. I saw the live play twice, so of course I like the video too.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book and America's top sniper in our generation. This is what the SEALS are about. Just the SEALS doing what they do best.
B000SEI230|4.0|Teenage years are full of emotional ups and downs.  This book takes these emotions and teaches valuable life lessons for the reader.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game ever and it finally has clouds and armor! that is awesome! although I wish there was skins to change. :(
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|Sam Beam is pure genius in this (and I own everything he's ever done). I love the slight jazz influence of this. The playfulness, the brilliant creativity that we've come to know topped off with someone who knows they have the power to step a wee bit outside of themselves and produce a masterpiece on top of other masterpieces of work with a slight twist that will not appoint. Trust me. This is a must add to any Iron and Wine addict's collection. BRAVO!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Now this is one book worth reading, and the ending is as fitting as it is unexpected.  A must read.
B009DT424Y|4.0|This item does everything they say it does. Just know that it uses HSP/HDP Bluetooth profiles (had to find that out in the manual) and my particular goal was to set it up in GNU/Linux, which eventually worked well.
B00BGIC170|5.0|This is our life right now minus the name calling.  One of funniest movies I've seen in a long time.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was very well written. The Irish brogue was not over the top and easy to follow. The subject matter was a little tough. I had seen a documentary before on the work camps and all those little graves, It is hard to digest and harder still to realize how long it went on.<br /><br />Jamie is a lovable character and his social flaws are totally endearing. You want to take him by the hand and clean his house, pick his clothes and teach him to drive. It becomes amazing how he continued to survive after everything he had endured. The fact that he was not thriving was not a surprise. What was surprising was the fact that he continued to try. The role his friends played in his life were heart warming.<br /><br />It would be easy to think that all Lydia needed was a little back bone and strength to break free from her parents influence, but she had more than most realize. To be able to have a career took incredible strength. The few moments of freedom and the fact that she was actively trying to pursue a relationship took incredible courage.<br /><br />The 4 versus 5 stars had nothing to do with the writing. It was due more with the tough subject matter and how completely uncomfortable it made me feel. I had little snatches of hope then they would be sucked out of me. Some of the scenes were so uncomfortable - his date and the wig incident, him approaching the hotel, they were painful. All of the scenes at the orphanage hurt but knowing how these children's lives would be affected forever were heart wrenching.<br /><br />I would recommend this book but it is not light reading. I would definitely read more from this author.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The fairytales are so perfectly interwoven and suspenseful.  We are all caught up with season 2 so we are going back and wathcing season 1 again.  I hope it's on forever. Love it.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I somehow only recently discovered the Firefly series and the movie Serenity.  Serenity can stand on its own as a great sci-fi film, but in the context of the series is even better.  It's basically the best and final episode of a short but great series.
B008H29YVY|5.0|Read Thielemann's The Ring comments on Amazon, some said that nowadays it is hard to get the artists into studio. Instead, it is \\"live\\" everywhere. Plus, Thielemann's Ring got quite some nasty criticisms about the singers. Where can the new-age Wagnerian go to find some good excitement? Can't we once again have stars like Nielsson, Hotter, Windgassen and above all Solti?<br /><br />I took a minute or two to recall my own \\"Wagner experience\\". My first ever Wagner was his Siegfried's Trauermusik 15 years ago. That was some shock my man. Ever since, all I wanted was the Ring. I read that Solti had it. Even though that little 15 CD set (the first CD version was 15, the 1997 version was 14) could cost a fortune, it was nowhere to find, oh, forgot to mention, it was in China 15 years ago. With time, I learned Solti had recorded all 10 Wagner's Bayreuth operas. There was this book about Wagner's recording in Chinese, written by a Wagner enthusiastic and collector. Every Solti's recording was on top of every opera introduced, that means his two Meistersingers were side by side. Even though I haven't touched a single Solti's recording, I became his cult's follower.<br /><br />Then it came to the new age, the big brands like DG, DECCA and Philips remix, repackage, relabel and resell the old recordings, the legacy of the generation that already passed away. Solti in DECCA, like Karajan in DG, again saved the day. The good news is, these repackages are in budget price. This 36 CD complete collection is even cheaper than the 1997 14-CD Ring!! Reading the booklet inside, browsing through the names of artists, most of them already passed away, I just can't stop feeling sad. This box includes Solti's Wagner recording from 1959-1980s. The stunning sonic alone is worth killing for. And it was decades ago, how much does it differ from the ones that we have right now? Not too much. It is also a wonder that the DECCA team had consistently done so. Plus, DECCA likes to include the theatrical sound to enhance the experience, you can hear thunder strike and sword fight.<br /><br />I think most music lover like Solti's Wagner. True, Solti didn't please everyone in every his recording. He seemed to place too much emphasis at the brass. It was metallic everywhere. For example for me, his Schumann was simply over the top. It was not cool to have some march-like sounds where there should be none. Some would say that was Solti's gimmick. But it was perhaps also his charm, especially in Wagner. I just like his ending in Rheingold and Götterdämmerung Act 2 and 3. His Trauermarsch is just fabulous. I like the way that the orchestra accompanied Sieglinde from calmness to complete excitement.<br /><br />Solti and Culshaw must know that they had the singers of the century. Look at those luxurious casts. Diva sang minor roles!! Stars everywhere. What a treat!<br /><br />If it is too much to ask for a new studio Wagner, at least let us have this Solti box.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Somehow I only now discovered this series, and I find it's one of my favorites ever.  Such a shame it was so short-lived.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A very good read on the life of an American Hero and effective combat soldier.  Every one should get a copy as the proceeds go for a good cause.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Awesome concert footage of the world's greatest rock and roll band. Just the rendition of Trampled Underfoot recorded in 1975 at Earls Court is worth the entire price. The extras are also amazing: there's some footage of the band on a TV show where the boys are tearing it up on stage and in the audience there's a woman holding an infant! Classic stuff.
B009MF56GC|1.0|Complete with phony animation and some of the worst filming I have ever seen.  Totally unbelievable.  Not worth your time or money,
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My 5 yr old sat and watched the whole movie.  From what I watched, it was a funny, tasteful movie.
B002ZG994U|1.0|Absolute garbage.  I hate animation and stupid stuff like that.  We no longer get the quality<br />we got with the original TV show.  How can modern Hollywood ever produce something<br />like that TV program.  This is crap.  Modern animation and crappy acting on the part of<br />some in the movie.  I have tried to get through this movie several times.  Just can't do it.<br />They try to replace quick-thinking, humorous cleverness with junk.

B002ZG993Q|5.0|Clooney was at his best with this role. His woman girlfriend would cause any man's heart to skip a beat. Very sad ending to the movie.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|Very original show and story line, gotta love the one-liners and dialogue, superbly cast, great acting...  Gotta love Joss Whedon!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|so well done. each of the characters are developed so thoroughly.  I love it, you'll enjoy it!  Start from the first season
B004I744AS|4.0|I like that you can customize what it<br /> shows.  One complaint has the wrong sign for my horoscope.  No worries though I don't believe in that anyway Mindanao interesting to see what ito would say though.

B008J34466|4.0|P!nk has always impressed me as a woman of great depth and feeling.  She lets her heart hang out there in her songs and I love that about an artist.  She will continue to shine as long as she continues to be real.

B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Even though some of the lyrics are quite raw, I have uploaded this CD to my car.  The beat he produces is addictive.  This man is up and coming.  I recommend his music to all ages...just get the softer version if children are present!
0920668372|2.0|I get the premise of this book, but I find it a little creepy.  When would a mom go in and pick up a teenaged son and rock him?  And then to have the mom get so old and sick that she can no longer sing the song?  I know what this would do to my 3 year old granddaughter.  She would worry and have nightmares about Mommy or Grandma getting old and sick.  Why go down that road?  I suppose if you're buying this for yourself or an adult child, it might be ok.  A much more up-beat book about a mother's love would be \\"I Love You, Stinky Face\\" by Lisa McCourt.  Unfortunately, it's not a recordable book, but it is still funny and loving.  I don't want my grandkids to cry while learning about love.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|This is a nice blend of dance and romance music!  JT keeps on wowing us as the years roll along.  He is quite a talent!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|and I guess the best part of seeing some of the highlights of the story of a &#34; genius &#34;  is that all along the way you can see all the mistakes he made and the struggle to make it better, to learn and to evolve.<br />For me the greater lesson, really comes with the live life at full,be wild and take some risks,<br />Life is simply too short to you pass by unnoticed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this book because it is the second book in the Hungar Games series and after reading the first book I just had to know what was going to happen to Katniss. Was a thrilling book just as good as the first in the series. I would recommend reading all of the Hungar Games books.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was recommended to me by a friend and I thank her.<br />I will recommend it to a friend, also.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Gave it a five because to me it was the best of them all. The things they put our lead charcter through are just simply madding and insane I had to put this book down a few time just to take in what was being done to Katniss. All she had been through and how was she ever going to survive in the new world being formed around her. The pain and the loss she she felt you as a reader felt as though you were with her.The author to me is a pure genius! Please read this series before seeing the movie if you watch the movie and skip the book you are sorely missing out.
0385535139|5.0|My husband is a John Grisham fan and loved the booked I purchased as a gift for him
B00457WZEI|4.0|Thought this &#34;children's book&#34; was good reading for anyone.  Actually decided to read the book after having seen both the movie and the play and wanted to see how the screenplay had changed the story.  Thought that the movie was much truer to the story than the play, which seemed a bit confusing.  Liked that the story was told in Joey's voice which would appeal to children also.  Grew up loving horse stories, so this took me back to my childhood.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really tight writing. Written with a sharp wit and sense of humor. Can't beat it for the price either. Highly recommended.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I'd wanted to see Django Unchained for a long time and it was worth the wait. I didn't check the time when I started watching and noticed about halfway through it was past 2am on a work night. Next night, the GF decided to check it out with me so I started it over and realized it's one of those flicks I can watch over and over. Another win for Tarantino.
B009WHLR9K|5.0|I chose to read this book because I am an avid tennis player and I have always been a great fan of Rafael Nadal. I also chose to read this book because I always wanted to read about how Nadal rose up to the top of the tennis world. I felt this was a great book because it explained what Nadal did during his childhood, and how he eventually made it to the World Tour.<br /><br />This book was about how Nadal dealt with problems such as injuries and family problems. One of the themes that I found during the book was \\"family problems.' One quote that I found while reading explained \\"He'd use rough language, he'd shout a lot, he'd frighten me, especially when the other boys didn't turn up for practice when there was just the 2 of us.\\" In this chapter, Nadal explains how growing up as a child Uncle Toni was really rough on him to a point where he didn't want to play any more.<br /><br />One of the terms that the author used was fawning which means to seek attention: \\"... When she reached me, to ask me in the most fawning sickly sweet way .\\" The author used this word to show the way the lady was talking to him.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any tennis players, even if they aren't fans of Rafael Nadal because it explains what goes through the mind of a champion.<br /><br />TJHS 11th grade student 2013
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|At first I thought it would be a mediocre series since I had no idea it existed until I found it in Amazon after 2 seasons already available. Looking forward to 3rd season. We really enjoyed.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This you must, must have in your Blu-ray Collection.  Boy... this Blu-ray restoration just did blew my mind off. Every Video Frame just took my breath away. If I only had a way to give it a Ten Stars.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|I loved Stardust!!!! It is one of my favorite movies. I would highly suggest this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My husband and I spent a lot of time together watching this program. We enjoyed the story line and felt it was well put together.
B0044XV3QY|3.0|I love love love this movie soooo much. It is fantastic. The movie would get a 5 star but the idea of the Family Audio version is the reason for the 3 star rating.  I was super excited that this set came with a DVD that had a \\"Family Audio\\" version with what they call and this is quoted from right on the box...\\"ALL objectionable language removed.\\" So I guess objectionable is relative.?? Because they did a fantastic job editing the really bad stuff, I was impressed (3 stars for that), but Hell's and Damn's are in there and when you sit down with your family expecting that ALL objectionable language was removed, and they say...hey that's a bad word and hey they left that one in. I was hoping for better when the box promoted ALL. I am disappointed that those words weren't deemed objectionable on the Family version. So this review is for others so they know that there are a \\"few\\" words that are in there. But still a fantastic movie.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. It opened my mind to a lot of things. It should be considered a drug. There is a lot of drama with people saying that the Fifty Shades trilogy it's a marketing trick and no literary masterpiece, but at the end reading should be entertaining and this is VERY entertaining. I believe that the author created the characters every woman could imagine and created a fun fantasy for people looking for an escape from reality. GREAT book! If you are a woman read it... If you are a man read it too and take notes!
0061950726|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely! The blend of the past and the present was captivating. The stories were heartbreaking and uplifting. There is a strong message of &#34;life is better if you look for the positives&#34; and &#34;fate has brought each of us to where we need to be&#34;. It is so well written, I couldn't put it down. The story and characters are wonderful. It is a really good read, I would highly recommend it to anyone.<br />I came to this author quite by accident (a book on the sale table), and she has become one of my favorites. She writes so well, and her stories are enthralling. I would highly recommend her other titles as well. (Bird in Hand, Sweet Water, Desire Lines)<br />Way to go, Christina! You've done it again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is like a drug. Never finish reading book 1 with out this one in your hands or you'll go crazy. I heard a lot of comments about Fifty Shades 2 (darker) that it wasn't so good, but I personally loved it.  It kept the flow from the first book. It felt like book one never ended and this was the same book.  I know is a cliche, and the writing is no Shakespeare, but if you're looking for a book to keep you very entertained this trilogy will do the trick.  Laters baby!

184448551X|4.0|It does not give any knew ideas or information.  Excellent for the novice blackwork student.  Very clear and concise illistrations and information.  Nicely bound.  A good addition to a collection.  However, a bit redudent if one has been doing Blackwork for a number of years.

B004U52VPS|1.0|It's really hard to stack the blocks correctly, as they don't stay stacked. Then, it's nearly impossible to hit them with the catapult - as an adult or child. My son was really excited about this, but in the end it's sort of languished in the cupboard because it's impossible to play well.
B008J34466|5.0|Just love the cd. Love singing along with the tunes. I made a copy for my friend and she loves it also
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Can't utter many words except for awesome; wow; excellent job Tarantino!! This will most definitely be added to my collection!
B009P5S11G|5.0|There are some songs wich I knew nad was able to sing along with the others I didnt know but surrely liked.
B005FISBTO|3.0|The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the Showtime ads at the beginning of the DVD contain a season spoiler!  You would think a bunch of educated studio executives could advertise from a past season or not a crucial scene.  Otherwise a great show, just close your eyes the first couple minutes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a really good book and the most important thing is that Gale likes Katniss. OMG! Wow book three. Can't wait!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|First off, I am extremely biased toward Quentin Tarantino. I love all his movies, I think he is a great screen writer/director. So no matter what, I usually think highly of his movies.<br /><br />That being said, I never saw Django until I got the Blu-Ray, but I was slightly disappointed it. It's still a great movie but I just expected a little more from Tarantino. I can't really put my finger on it either. Christoph Waltz plays an amazing character but at times it really came off more like a shell of Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds. Leo should of won an Oscar for his role, especially when he actually cuts himself on broken glass. Great scene overall. Jamie Foxx was good, nothing special in my eyes, but that's just me. Samuel L. Jackson comes off as annoying most of the movie, but that's probably a good thing since I think that's how the character was suppose to come off as. Everyone acts well and gives it their all. Just something in the story seemed to be missing. It made sense and all, I just expected a bit more. Like I said, I can't really put my finger on it but I would say it is one of Tarantino's weaker movies in the past 10-20 years.<br /><br />As far as the packaging goes, it's great. Blu Ray looks great, sound seems a little low compared to most movies, but it's not a huge deal. Everything works perfectly, can't complain.<br /><br />I would easily recommend this product to anyone.
1936608898|5.0|Absolutely changed my life. I started doing the Whole 30 before reading this -- and once I read it, I was floored! The science behind what I already knew was a great plan for my body was incredibly informative and earth-shattering. I can say first hand that I have followed the plan outlined in this book and I no longer have migraines, I don't have any stomach issues (and I used to have a stomache ache and acid reflux EVERY DAY), and so much more energy.<br /><br />If you only read one book this year - read this one.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Part 1 and 2 just seem like totally different movies.  To me they shouldn't have labeled them part 1 and part 2.  I know it's based off the comic and that's fine.  But they really should have just labeled them as stand alone movies in the Dark Knight Returns continuity.
1401923127|5.0|It is a great book and the reading is easy. The ideas are exciting, right in line with God's words on thought. I do believe that the environment plays a tremendeous part in our lives. Thumbs up!

1476734941|3.0|The concept is so simple that I got the book hoping for a little more insight, and a lot of recipes for the 500 calorie days..  Didn't feel either goal was really achieved.  Got more recipe ideas by just googling 5/2 fast diet, or similar concepts.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It would be more fun if it didn't stop in the middle of the wee world and say u have to buy the full version
B008220C38|1.0|We were so looking forward for this movie but were so disappointed. This movie had all the ingredients to be a great movie - epic love story, fine actors, a great director and an Oscar for best costumes. Quite amazing how you still can screw up a movie that wasn't probably cheap to make to begin with.<br />To say it in short, the movie was garbage and a complete waste of an evening. The story was there but portrait in a way that just makes you wonder \\"what am I missing here??\\". A clear attempt of trying to be modern and hip and give the whole thing the artsy-fartsy approach.<br />Whoever was involved in that movie needs a real good smack on the back of his head to set him straight again. The movie could have been marvelous, instead it was a sheer disappointment.<br />The only good thing coming out of this is, that I will read the book now just to see how good the book is and how bad the movie was.
0792835050|5.0|Great story line. Wonderful intrigue and characters. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. I now own the DVD and book. I highly recommend it. All of the actors did an incredible job of acting. Truly believable with gripping suspense.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I love that I can rotate my Kindle Fire HD and stand it up in either portrait or landscape mode.
0802473156|4.0|Interesting concepts. Good for all couples reading. This would be a good book for anyone to read whether in a relationship  or not. Good advice for any age couple.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|It's a shameless shoot'em up movie.  Go to a shooting gallery and shoot the ducks. You'll have a lot more fun.  These nitwit movies truly aid in the dumbing down of America.  It's a bridge to being able to knock off humans once you join the army.  Drink a bottle of vodka, swallow some downers and whack your head against a cement wall and the movie will make sense.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This an awesome book for any age, race or ethnic group. This novel in the second of Follett's newest trilogy. If I taught high school American History I would make this series required reading. Three dimensional characters give an honest account of what WWII was like on all fronts for citizens as well as governments. it also gives a small account of what the climate of the US was like prior to the integration laws.
B001KOFH2G|4.0|I first watched this movie on DVD when initially released without having watched firefly. I found it to be a very good movie at the time. I recently got round to watching the series Firefly and with a better understanding of the background and characters it made the movie even better on my second viewing. The movie's tone is darker than in the series but being a feature film I suspect this is one of the compromises that had to be made.<br />I rewatched this movie on Blu Ray, the Picture quality is excellent but I did find the audio to be lacking where dialog would be obscured by the background music/explosions. I often had to raise my volume to decipher what was being said. Surround effects such as explosions, flight scenes were quite good however. I viewed this on an htpc with TMT 5 software, Radeon 6570 capable of DTS HD-MA bitstreaming.<br />On another note Blu Ray case's spine was cracked which is why I give it a 4 star overall rating in conjunction with the audio.
B004XZR63M|3.0|The general rules are valid, it's a matter of personal view if you adopt them or not. I find the book entertaining and easy to read, however outdated.
0385349947|5.0|Today's women are highly educated and prepared to lead and succeed and yet, we haven't given ourselves permission to reach our full potential. The question becomes, why? And that, is exactly what author Sheryl Sandberg documents for us in her well-written and well-researched book Lean In.<br /><br />Women:<br />*If you work in the corporate world, this is a must read book for you.<br />*If you work a home-based business, this is a must read book for you.<br />*If you are thinking about starting a business, this is a must read book for you.<br />*If you have a professional career, this is a must read book for you.<br />*If you are just starting college, this is a must read book for you.<br />*If you want to become a more effective leader, this is a must read book for you.<br />*If you have a daughter, this is a must read book for you.<br /><br />I am impressed with the research that went into this book. Writing about what most women know emotionally to be true or have actually experienced in our lives first hand is one thing but, having our thoughts, feelings and experiences backed up by research, facts and figures is affirming and eye-opening.<br /><br />I believe Lean In should be a must read for women who want to succeed in business and especially those women who strive for top leadership positions. Whether you are a business owner or work in corporate America, all women who are striving for professional success seem to be facing the same internal and external obstacles.<br /><br />I also believe that once we understand these internal and external obstacles, positive growth and empowerment will begin and with that growth will come greater personal, professional and financial opportunities for all women.<br /><br />Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg is not a fast read. I suggest you take this book a couple of chapters at a time and really study what the author is documenting for us. Read this book with pen and paper in hand - make notes, underline major points of interest and plan on going back to reread those parts that can make a difference to you and your career choices.<br /><br />I agree with the author, we women should begin discussion groups so we can come together to talk about what we are reading and how these insights can have an impact on our lives. We should also invite the upcoming generation of future leaders to join in the discussion. Now is the time to go forward with the information we can gather from this book and use it to empower and improve not only ourselves but also, future generations of women leaders.<br /><br />I grew up in 60's and 70's and know first hand the \\"struggles\\" women faced in the workplace. Yes, improvements have been made but, I believe there is much yet to improve. Reading Sheryl Sandberg's book Lean In is a great place to begin. Reading and discussing it with other like-minded women is an even better place to begin creating long-lasting internal and external change for the positive, now and into the future.and plan on going back to reread those parts that can make a difference to you and your career choices.<br /><br />I agree with the author, we women should begin discussion groups so we can come together to talk about what we are reading and how these insights can have an impact on our lives.

0439023521|5.0|I read this book because my 13 year old wanted to read it in her school book group, and I didn't know anything about the book. We both loved it and enjoyed discussing every twist and turn. Now we are reading the second book and are loving that one, too.<br />This book is appropriate for teens and most preteens, but it would be too scary and dark for elementary kids and sensitive preteens. Children in the book do kill each other, and that can be hard to take.  My daughter didn't want to read it until now, which was good because she is old enough now to understand the story's ideas/symbolism/theme instead of being simply scared of the events of the plot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game where you move your finger to move and jump.  The format changes from time to time but it makes it funner. You also collect coins. And the objective id not to her run over by trains or run into poles. Fun and great for all ages!
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I love superhero stories, but my favorites are those that are about (mostly) normal people that, through a (mostly) believable series of events, develop into superheroes. And of those, my favorite stories are those that show the hero in a light that also casts shadows on his/her character. Arrow meets both criteria, and is done in a way that I find to be surprisingly well done. I would certainly recommend checking this series out.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|A little slow in the beginning.<br />The little kids were bored with it before the disaster in the sea. But great after that. I wonder which version really happened?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is as good as the other two books of the trilogy. Hard to put them down very well written
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's a fantastic show- in a sad, depressing, EOTWAWKI kind of way. Awesome acting, great plot twists, hasn't jumped the shark yet.

1468179993|3.0|I got a few pointers out of it so it was worth the purchase. I wouldn't call it a WOW book that you would keep at your fingertips to refer to as a resource but a good how book.

B00APUQRPC|5.0|As with all Clint Eastwood movies, you will not be disappointed in this film. As a huge fan of his acting and the movies he produces, I highly recommend that you watch this one. It's definitely worth the rental fee, and in the future I fully intend to buy it for my home collection, as well as buy and download it for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 to watch during long road trips. It's one that I can watch repeatedly and never tire of it.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|You like watching people argue for two plus hours.  There were a few funny parts but those weren't enough to offset the rest of the movie which was mostly miserable people being horrible to each other.

B00BMKDTNC|4.0|The only reason I read this stupid book was to be done with this god forsaken series once and for all.  I hate the character and wish the authors would have killed off more.<br /><br />I usually talk about trash sci-fi and trash fantasy stuff and give it high ratings.  This is trash, but not in the good way.  It takes effort to read this stuff, it does not entertain and it generally just leaves me in a foul mood after reading it.  Feist is entertaining and sparks the imagination, Gibson is entertaining and sets the imagination on fire, Brett (Warded Man) leaves you wanting more.  This leaves you wondering if you have somehow been captured by the Dark Lord and are being tortured.  Only the Dark Lord himself wouldn't make the forsaken read this crap.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars?  Because it's over.  Done.  No more!  Raise your voice in celebration.
B006IO045S|3.0|the Beckett and Castle banter feels more like it belongs in season 3 than in season 4. Castle wakes up cuffed to the women he's professed his love too and is in a life and death scenario and doesn't mention how he feels or what he said to Beckett at the end of season 3
0525953728|4.0|A good look at how our guys feel and react on the front lines where none of us are trained to go. We always say we appreciate all of their sacrifices for us, but in reading this book you really understand a little better what that really means.
B004YZKKAW|4.0|Good episode following up on S3E3 (Under the Gunn) completing the &#34;Royce&#34; storyline overall good episode I'd recommend to any castle lover
B000FBFN1U|5.0|reading fifth book from collection. renjoyed all thus far. looking forward to reading all. i think there are 12 books all in all.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie, it is way better than I thought. I'm 50 years old and didn't think I would like it.
B002RVEIAI|5.0|I love everything about the whole terminator series.  Good story line and the jumping back and forth in time acts as a really cool brainteaser when you think about it!
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|While it is a good app i hate that there are no page numbers, so i can't bookmark or save where i left off at if i have a word document. It makes it hard to navigate. Especially on some really long essays.
B00BXF2S3S|5.0|Unlike many long running TV series, NCIS maintains its high quality. Great acting, scripts, filming, and production. And it's great to see The Man From U.N.C.L.E in another hit.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful entertainment.  Never want the show to end.  Great acting - drama, suspense, humor - the whole nine yards and then some.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thought this game was awesome..... I can't wait for the next one.......when will it be out?<br />Fantastic.....  I want more more more!!!!
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|I know going into it that I don't agree with Dawkins, however I have not done much reading of atheist material, so I thought it would be helpful to better understand where people are coming from.  In my opinion he comes across more like he has an axe to grind, rather than a sincere interest in teaching people how he sees things and why.  To be fair, I have read many Christian authors who fall into the same trap of belittling their opponents rather than making a strong case for what they believe.  I am not saying that Dawkins doesn't make his case, but that if he does, it is hard to find it hidden underneath what sounds like emotionally based resentment of believers.  His examples of how believers behave and think and present themselves, I am sure they are true examples that exist in the world, but they were all very foreign to my own experience and relationships.  It seems that wants to portray believers as naive, backwater, lemmings.  In truth, being engaged in academia he certainly has no short supply of sharp intellectual theists to engage in his debate if he were not afraid to give his opponents a more fair and accurate representation of why and how they believe.  Finally, I felt that his portrayal of  believing left no room for my own experience.  In my life I have certainly sought to engage my intellect in understanding the world around me, including my faith based interpretation of reality.  I did not come to faith through argument however, but through encounter with the Divine.  I expect that Dawkins would have a scientific reason to explain away my experience, but it seemed to me that his book did very little to acknowledge this reason for belief, much less to admit the possibility that God might be real, God might interact with creation, some believer might have had real epiphany experiences that are as of yet foreign to Dawkins and therefore, while he might be making a sincere effort to decipher the evidence he has collected, he should leave room for thepossibility that not all the evidence has been revealed to himself yet.  I am sorry that the last point was so poorly constructed, but I write these responses to amazon emails in between phone calls at work, so I need to be quick about it.  I hope this helped.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|This was a great movie! I have seen it in the past but it was just as good this time.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is now my all time favorite movie!!!!!!! Have watched it 5 times now.  Great in every way!!! Took a few minutes to adjust to the English subtitles.  Loved hearing French being spoken.
B00138KFYO|5.0|It's Janis Joplin... with her greatest hits. Possibly the best blues-rock vocalist EVER! What else would need to be said?
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|Love the music. Just wish it had contained even more songs. What a great, touching, based on a true story movie and soundtrack.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this clock &#34;ALL&#34; the time. Especially the alarm function, which comes in very handy, when I want to set an alarm, for a quick nap, after reading in my kindle. It is very user friendly. This clock allows you to program a variety alarms. It has numerous and some very &#34;fun&#34; alarm sounds. I highly recommend the installation of this application.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|The kids loved it immediately - and continue to build 'stuff' and use their imaginations - good for them and fun for them!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My 5 year old twin daughters absolutely love all the Dr. Panda apps. I'll even admit that I like to play them as well. They are very well created and each app has plenty of different activities to chose from!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Not sure what this is.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My 5 year old twin daughters absolutely love all the Dr. Panda apps. I'll even admit that I like to play them as well. They are very well created and each app has plenty of different activities to chose from!
B004TN7QPG|5.0|Don't know how I got along with out it......So glad I have it now. I recommend it to every one.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app! good alarm:) also tells current time and current weather! you can also change what type of clock it is. Its more than an alarm clock. its like 4 apps in one! GET THIS APP!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|It is what it is.. I love Vampire Diaries.. Other than me loving vampire diaries, Quality was great, no scratches, no skipping.. No problem.. 5 star, deserved it..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey, all 3 seasons thus far, is excellent!!  Bravo!  The acting, the writing, the cinematography, costumes, etc etc are marvelous.  We have been so impressed by the quality...it's like watching a movie in each episode.  The English do not disappoint!  It's a show that both women and men will enjoy.  I must admit, initially I had a hard time convincing my hubby in watching it.  He sat down with me for nine minutes for one of the episodes of Season 1 and declared it &#34;boring!&#34;  However, it wasn't until a moment of clarity several weeks later that he decided to give it one more go...and was hooked!  Now, he can hardly wait until evening comes and the kids are in bed to watch it together!  So, if you have some reservation in watching it, I--we--highly recommend watching DA from the very beginning (Season 1, Episode 1) so you know what's going on, who the characters are, etc.  You'll be glad you did!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love all the action and suspense in this season!!! The ending is great and leaves you wanting to get to season 4, but not hanging alot.
B00BHMF578|2.0|A bit boring. Characters not well developed. Story slow until the end. You didnt get a good sense of what led to the tension either. It was placed in a bit of a vacuum for those who dont know the history.
0802473156|5.0|Enjoyed Gary Chapman's more defined understanding of what &#34;Love Language&#34; is and what direction you can perceive to go in. Most helpful in giving an better insight than a bunch of girls/women talking about the subject. It's like a hands-on version of what you can do or expect.
B000N90JGI|2.0|I generally have an unbelievably high tolerance for romantic comedies, and beyond that I love Matthew Mcconaughey's movies and acting. But using Jennifer Lopez as the leading lady nearly killed me--it is not my first time seeing it but every time I watch it (because there is nothing else to watch) I am so amused by how poorly Lopez acts; she does not have the face/aura of an elegant wedding planner (though she is pretty), so I do not understand how she fits this role in any possible way. If you are looking for a free movie to watch then I would not say no to this one, just know that afterwards you will not feel too great either!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|Great fast service. Perfect online ordering and the help with anything is great. There plenty of movies and games. They have all sorts of things to choose from. Its flate out great
B003VANOFY|5.0|Arrived faster than expected. these are amazing headsets. Easy to install and use, very intuitive. I recommend for people who are searching for new Gaming headsets.
B0078ZYXSA|5.0|Excellent follow-up after many years to their first album. Gets better with each listen. Several songs analyzing love with humor.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|I've seen this movie before.  It was borrowed and lost.  I purchased it to replace my copy. Good Movie. !
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks's books you cannot put down; however, they sometimes are filled with too much sadness.  SAFE HAVEN avoided excessive sadness and allowed for a happy ending.  A nice book to have for a long plane ride or a relaxing day on the beach
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Great<br />pancakes good book of the most popular stories of a bit of a new study shows the first place
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good game keeps me coming back for more. I like the colors of the titles the size they are not so little that you can hardly see them like in some other games.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|This is one of the better stopwatch apps I've tried. But I wonder about some of the permissions. Nice timers too. Overall, a good app.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book's message in net is not all that new- cut carbs and you'll lose weight.  The discussions about wheat specifically are sometimes well-founded and sometimes advanced largely from anecdotal evidence.  Nonetheless, there is some fascinating stuff in the book, and i've recommended it to many people.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Shin's story about being born in a North Korean prison camp and then escaping was riveting. The stories not having enough to eat, the beatings and nearly being worked to death were heartbreaking and I promise you after reading this you will never complain again. Interwoven in Shins story is some interesting background on North Korea and the secret prisons housing three generations of dissidents. If Kim Jung Un goes down and the political prisons are emptied I think Shins story will be a big part of it. My fingers are crossed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game pretty well. It is fun to take care of the horses, but some of the really cool stuff to buy like unicorns and awesome tack costs gems or just a lot of money which is hard to earn. All in all it is a fun game. I does take time to finish tasks sometimes but it's kinda like taking care of a real horse!
B000FA675C|5.0|Great plot, interesting ideas.  Claiming this represents the truth without citing any research is silly.  But as a story, it is very well written.  The puzzles are fun, the pace and the twists are well done.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book without having seen the movie. Hope the movie does justice to the book as the book is excellent.
0142410705|3.0|This is a charming coming-of-age adventure story with quirky characters I defy most people not to love. I enjoyed all of the math and footnotes, as well, though I did not appreciate the disparaging, one-sided remarks about Kentucky. John Green hasn't really experienced my home state, if he thinks he can write it off so easily.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love the Twitter app! It allows me to access my account and those I'm following quickly and never fails me.
1594744769|3.0|I was hoping this book would be a little more \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" and a little less \\"My Little Pony\\". Granted, the writing is excellent, it's a logically constructed plot, and clear characterization, but...I found myself bored after the first two hundred pages. Also, I didn't really believe in the ultimate conflict at the center of the plot, which is a major problem. Then again, maybe young readers will buy into it more.<br /><br />More mystery! More creepiness! Like the photos.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love this book. I laughed out loud all throughout the reading, scaring my Basset Hounds half to death on occasion. Ms. Fey has written a smart, sassy  and savvy book that gives a generous peek into the mind of a masterful comedian/writer. MORE!
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I think the main lesson of this movie was about acceptance.  Could be good vs evil, or maybe about spoiled brats getting their way.  Emperor Kuzco angers the kingdom Witch and after a hilarious mixup by the Witch's idiot assistant --it's pretty clear that he's beyond mentally challenged---The Emperor turns into a llama and befriends a farmer from the very village the Emperor wanted to raze to build a summer palace.  Typical wrong place/ wrong time comedy.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|One of the best roles I've ever seen George Clooney play.  He did a magnificent job!  One of my favorite movies of all time!
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|this movies was not only weird, but it was boring. I couldn't tell if it was trying to be a  comedy or a drama gone bad.
B00013F38K|5.0|there was a little distortion at the end of one of the dvd's.There is no one perfect in this world.I would recomend this to anyone who likes old westerns/and the old good verses the bad.
B007K3JCAE|3.0|Carrying on from where the first one left off.<br />Cool action and some funny lines.<br />Like in the first instalment, my only complaint (read, wish) is that Robert Downey Jnr speaks clearly!!!  It's really annoying when, at times, he comes across as mumbling.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Cons:<br />Well the book is pretty good for basic word writing formats.  As you get deeper into inserting a TOC it is more complicated.  In the book they tell you exactly how to insert a TOC in word 2010 but not in previous versions. That will make problems in the Kindle Previewer program if you use older versions of word.<br />Pros:<br />Other then that it was very helpful for starting out as a beginning writer for Kindle books in word.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Ever since Daniel Craig took over the role of JB, I feel the portrayal of &#34;the man&#34; is more realistic - ie, bumps, bruises, unshaven look, worn out, serious injuries, etc.  In fact, I have all 3 he's done.<br />Even though I enjoyed Skyfall, I couldn't help but feel that the ending could've been better, somehow...  I asked myself, &#34;was that it???&#34;... Anyway, I leave it to you all.<br />Otherwise, Skyfall is good.
1609611543|5.0|This book is a great mixture of scientific explanation and plain speak - you don't have to be a bioligy major to understand Dr. Davis' text.  After reading this book you will fully understand exactly why wheat (gluten) is so bad for you and why Americans are facing an obesity epidemic and a healthcare crisis.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cats are cute and fluffy. do you think so? I have 5 cats they are all awesome. dogs are slobbery. do you think so.
B00BHU261S|3.0|While the acting was great it was comes up short on showing his early years leading up to this point in his life. As a Hichcock fan I recommend it, but not a GREAT movie.
B0002X314C|5.0|I really love this album...  I was not familiar with the music of John Legend before now, but can't stop listening.  His style is unique and definitely not the usual R&B. Highly recommend.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This was the last Disney movie produced by Walt himself before he passed. It's one of the very best Disney movies that every family should own. My son is 1 1/2 and absolutely adores it. It has fabulous music that I find myself even singing, and a heartwarming story between friendly animals in the jungle and a young boy. There is one scene with a mean tiger that may be frightening to young ones (I usually skip past this part- it's short) but otherwise a great movie that you'll enjoy too! :)
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Typical Tarantino.  Decent story with lots of action (with gratuitous blood gushing)  Well acted with over the top performance by DiCaprio
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the flexibility of this Bible.  However, I guess I need to find the offline version, because the version I have is not accessible without WiFi.
B005K17RU0|5.0|All the pertinent information in a nice Holo interface. Awesome!  I definitely recommend this app to any weather-obsessed Kindle owner.
0385535147|4.0|I don't think this is one of Mr. Grisham's best, but I did like the first 50-60%...then it was quite repititious. However, I did NOT see the twist coming, which isn't terribly surprising since I'm ususally the last to know anything, but when the truth started to come out it made up for some of the parts that were slow. I enjoyed it, but glad I didn't pay for it! I think sometimes authors step out of their comfort zone to try something different, and I can't fault them for that. I'm a pretty faithful follower of Mr. Grisham's novels and will continue to be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer it's fun, creative, and it makes u feel like ur in the game!!! I love how there are a variety of characters, and hoverbords. I also love mystery boxes!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A REALLY good book about life,all the determination to live it to the fullest.  I really enjoyed it,  even the the tough times.
044042321X|5.0|For fans of both Game of Thrones and graphic novels, you can't go wrong with this book. This particular graphic novel only covers part of the first book (hence why it's called volume one). So don't expect this to be the entire first book in the series. That being said, it follows the events pretty well and the artwork is pretty good. It's a great addition to the regular GoT novels.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is my first purchase that included the digital copy. I love the added bonus of the digital copy. I now have Les Mis on my Kindle to watch any time!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The book started off great, but became predictable. Worth a read though although it seemed to drag on at times.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool has been getting a lot of attention on the internet lately and I had to know what the fuss was all about. The first installment was really intriguing and left me with a lot of curiosity (I grabbed part 1 quickly since it was free, so I ended up buying the omnibus). This story is about a post-apocalyptic dystopian society where the people live inside an underground silo. When someone breaks the law, they get sent outside to clean, which is basically a death sentence. The air outside is toxic and no one can survive, so the \\"criminals\\" are forced outside in suits that keep them safe from the deadly air long enough to clean the silo's outside sensors (with wool pads) before they walk toward the hill outside and die.<br /><br />The cleaning suits, I guess I picture them as astronaut suits sort of, they can only withstand the poisonous air for a limited time, until they begin to deteriorate. But is that all? Is the outside really that dangerous? The cleaners don't seem to think so at first, especially those who request to be let out. But there are secrets that only certain people are privvy to, and as more people unravel details and get sent to cleaning, we get glimpses into the sinister nature of some members of the silo who have all the control. Many questions are asked, including what happened and how did the silo system get started. Not all the answers are clearly presented, but what we do learn is quite disconcerting.<br /><br />There are some aspects of this book that I did not like so much. I felt that it bogged down at times with details that took too much time to get past. Yes, I understand the silo is tall and apparently there is no elevator, so everyone has to walk up and down the 100+ flights of stairs from top to bottom. I got really tired of hearing how exhausted these characters are from climbing all those stairs. I also had a hard time with the timeline. Sometimes it seemed like we skipped forward weeks or months in time and it wasn't easy to tell. There were a lot of \\"oh snap did that just happen\\" moments that got my heart pumping and then it slowed down with all the details that took away from that excitement. But overall, I enjoyed this read and it ended on an uplifting note that resolved the important issues and made me interested in reading future parts someday.ere were a lot of \\"oh snap did that just happen\\" moments that got my heart pumping and then it slowed down with all the details that took away from that excitement.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Characters and settings were excellent and the storyline very engaging.  Looking forward to the next season.  Very enlightening how their changes parallel ours in our world.
B004132HZS|5.0|A great new twist on the original stories.  The two main characters Benedict Cumberbatch ( Holmes ) and Martin Freeman ( Watson ) play well off each other. The writing, production value all top notch! If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan you'll love this.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I was excited with the newer Star Trek movies recently being made with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto ( latest one coming out May 13, 2013!!!!) and when I saw this offer I jumped on it quickly! Spent 2 weekends watching entire collection.  Bonus &#34;Captain's Summit&#34; hosted by Whoopi Goldberg was an added treat!!
B000N90JGI|2.0|It's everything you would expect out of the modern American romantic comedy.  Women will love it, but film buffs will despise it.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Great music as I have come to expect from Blake. Recommend this CD to anyone who loves Country music by<br />the best.
B0057GYOA4|4.0|I'm a gonna buy the original cd on ebay any minute only cuz I can't find the non remastered version here on amazon.  If this remastered version is so terrible sounding I can't imagine how great the original cd is cuz this thing flys off the stereo.  I'm a like blastin' it too hard in my car for my rear injured speaker to handle it and I can't help myself.  Other thing is I read in the little booklet which is mostly pictures and not a lot of info but the pics are nice, that the Smart Sessions from 1990 actually have a different drummer.  I'm a big fan of Grohl's drumming, with Nirvana and particuarly on Queens of the Stone Age 'Songs for the Deaf' cd.  Incredible.  I was all smug listening to the Smart sessions goin', 'Yea, that Dave Grohl can really drum.' and then I see it's a whole different guy.  Very impressive.  There's about 4 lively songs (compared to basically acoustic ones of the 8 Smart sessions songs) that are totally worth this Deluxe Edition just by themselves.  I couldn't afford the big 'ol box of Nevermind but this does the job since the Paramount live show dvd can be purchased separately and, at this time, cheaply on amazon.  It would be nice to have Parmount live on cd.  I bought the Reading live dvd and cd and that thing cooks too.  I've been reinvigorated with Nivrana in recent weeks by getting this Deluxe edition.  It's my favorite Nirvana album by far.  Kurt appears to have known how to write a good alt rock song, as do whoever writes Offspring's songs and the lead guy for Green Day.  All three of them have a knack for getting songs to flow well.  The Weezer song writer does too but it doesn't quite hit it like Nirvana.  It's really great that in one of my favorite Weezer songs he cites Nevermind as, 'hearing the chords that set me free.'  I'm always impressed with a trio can bang out so much incredible music.  Not a lot of groups can pull it off but like White Stripes somehow often manage to sound full with just two people (and my wife goes crazy about the pedestrian drumming).  What it really means is the singing and guitar alone can really make a band go and with this drummer Nirvana was really able to create some classic alt rock songs, really, as great as any rock song period.  Smells Like Teen Spirit seems to me to be the greatest video ever and Weird Al Yankovic does one of the greatest parodies of a song every using the same janitor in his version of it.  I love hearing them play live doing that song in particular but I was impressed with Stay Away and On a Pine or whatever the next song is called.  They just exploded off the disc and had me gleefully thrashing about.  The boombox trax show what the band could have done and gone and been if that was all they could do, nice, but nothing special.  Worth hearing cuz of what the songs became.  Once they got in the studio proper they really knew how to make real music.  And not all bands can pull of high quality studio and high quality live versions of songs but, clearly, Nirvana could.  It's an incredible shame that Mr. Cobain had that stomach pain and heroin thing and appears to have decided suicide made some sense.  The lost of a musical artist that only hurts.  He left behind some masterpieces.  Working with his band mates he was able to do what's nearly a perfect album, so much so, that the fleshed out version, the deluxe edition treatment, was called for.  I'm a gonna git me the Parmount show now.  God bless you chillin'.  It's a fleeting life.  What's on the other side?  We'll all find out for sure after won't we.  I hope Kurt is in heaven enjoying awesome beauty.  He sure could make some.zy about the pedestrian drumming).

B002ZG99NG|5.0|A simple review. Affleck can do no wrong. He will show himself to be one of the great American directors.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This books actually portrays their love story. I can't wait to read the next one. Ana seems to become more brave when deal with the many different styles of Christian.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Tarantino is still a young man. And his body of work is showing the growth of the man.<br />He will be one of our greatest film makers by the time he gets to his senior years.<br />This movie shows what Americans need to see. The casual mistreatment of slaves and the shame we Americans should feel for those that lived only 150-200 years ago. The film shows the barbaric way slaves were treated. And at the same time, a brilliant and intense movie. And with that sly Tarantino humor.<br />Christopher Waltz is the whole movie. This man is a marvel.<br />My wife usually doesn't like bloody movies but she was so into this flick, that it caused her to cry. And she stayed emotionally attached to it for a couple days.<br />This movie most definitely should have won the Oscar for best picture, not Zero Dark Thirty.
0316223239|5.0|Room by Emma Donoghue is a beautiful, brilliant, devastating, moving, and wholly original novel. The premise is deceptively simple and sinister in the same moment; a mother and her son are captives together in a room measuring eleven feet by eleven feet. However, it is in her execution that Donoghue manages to elevate the narrative to a heartbreaking genius as the reader experiences this microcosm of a world through the eyes of the five-year-old Jack. Being a child narrator, he brings his own innocence and naïve sensibilities that communicate in ways which are at turns cute or quaint and then horrifying or heart wrenching. Donoghue adeptly touches on a number of issues with the subtlety of a master in social commentary, all while infusing the characters of Ma and Jack with enough uniquely flawed beauty to earn them places among the great and unforgettable characters of literature. As I read I was carried away by this book; my heart raced, my eyes teared up, and once I'd turn the final page, I felt a great catharsis from having experienced this novel.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I got hooked to this show with the first episode. Have fun with the Son's. This message will self destruct
B009LGO88E|5.0|This product was perfect for the 3DS XL.  I got it exclusively for Monster Hunter and it makes the game ten times easier to play.  Installing the battery is quick, and activating it within a game is even simpler.  A must for anyone with a 3DS XL
0061537969|5.0|I had read this book before and I loved it.  I bought this book for my daughter who does not like to read much and she was really touched by it.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This is a very good DVD, you will enjoy watching it. It was enjoyable. Have a great and blessed day, Bill
B00BSW6F26|1.0|I thought this one looked interesting.  I was mistaken.  The \\"scenes\\" are flat and boring ..... much like booking a room at a nice hotel and being shown to a room in a low-budget establishment using a number as part of the franchise name.  No depth to them at all.  Basic graphics and no more.  I didn't get far, I admit.  Just a couple levels told me this wouldn't be very challenging.  The soundtrack could've been made by a ten-year-old, and likely done better, and there is no smoothe flow during play.  It felt like it had all been cut and pasted.  Boring, boring and NOT worth the money.  Refund please!
B00BLGZDYA|4.0|If you enjoy films that push the creative envelope with a mix of genres then you'll be amazed by this one.  Captivating!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Interesting mixture of sci-fi, history and romance.  Easy read.  In part predictable, but I wasn't disappointed when it played out as I guessed it might.<br />Accidentally learnt a lot about America in the 60's also.<br />Recommended.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|My favorite movie. The blu-ray is very high quality, the audio is outstanding. The opening scene pulls you in, and you'll be on the edge of your seat for the next 2 1/2 hours.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Well, not exactly...or even close.  Too bloody (oh, right, Tarrantino) but some humor as well.  I wouldn't plan a re-run.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great clock.  Works good on my kindle, without any problems.  Has an alarm, too.  If i could improve it I would add a little instruction bar to help figure it out.  But i did get it working the way i wanted it to.  My husband would not have a problem getting it set, but it took me several minutes.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good plot, hard to predict and well written.<br />The double unfolding of the narrative is very well sustained throughout the entire work
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Slows down or stops working frequently. Not a whole lot of learning for kids. Mostly a money pit. Not the biggest fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for ever one out there you would love it .<br />It would be great for ever one you can play with your friends and ever thing
B002N44XSG|5.0|These books are really exciting and you never know what might happen next. They're so good it's hard to put them down.
076421120X|5.0|From the Cover:<br />\\"Bestselling Author and Renowned Worship Leader Darlene Zschec has led millions of Christians in worship as she's written and performed such songs as \\"Shout to the Lord\\" and penned bestsellers Extravagant Worship and The Kiss of Heaven. This collection of all new thought-provoking devotions has been designed to accompany her upcoming live album, which will be produced by four-time Grammy award winner Israel Houghton, and will include guest performances by Kari Jobe and Michael W. Smith.<br />Each devotion will reflect on grace given to the reader through Christ's life, death, and resurrection. This beautifully packaged book will be released in conjunction with the album. Perfect for Christians looking for fresh readings on the passion and resurrection of Christ, or as a thoughtful seasonal gift.\\"<br /><br />Darlene Zschech has done a wonderful job of bring a daily devotional to us. It's formatted as one page a day, starting with January 1 and ends, of course, with Dec 31st. Each day offers scripture, and a wonderful life-application detailing and explaining the scripture. Each day ends with a prayer. I love it and I really love the nice, heavy hardback cover of the book. The pages are all nice and heavy too. (Crazy thing to comment on perhaps, but I love how good paper feels in your hands.)<br />The colors on the cover are beautiful and mesmerizing. Cover design gets an A++.<br />This would make an excellent gift, as the whole package is so attractive.<br /><br />I received this as a free preview from Bethany House.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was a very exhausting book.  I  just wanted this book to be over. It wore me out emotionally.  I can't figure out why the ratings were good for this book. I would not recommend it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I have played it online and on the kindle. My grandson says the kindle is better because the bombs makes a better blast on the kindle. We really like it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|HI, I RECOMMEND THIS APP.  IT HAS A SIGNAL STRENGTH METER ON IT...ITS GREAT FOR CHECKING THE SIGNAL AS YOU MOVE YOUR ROUTER UP/DOWN OR TO ANOTHER ROOM.  I GOT 20 % MORE SIGNAL JUST BY MOVING MY ROUTER A FEW FEET.. (HOTSPOT)....  THIS ALSO FINDS ALL THE LOCAL SIGNALS AND MEASURES EACH ONE. ALSO IT SHOWS THE BUSY BANDWIDTH OF ALL THE CHANNELS...( NICE IF YOU LIVE IN THE CITY).....I WOULD DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN.....
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I enjoyed playing this with my co-worker. Amazing how many different images you can get for one subject depending on who is drawing. Some are a bit hard to come up with but it makes you get creative!
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie...it is a great family pic.  It is both heart warming and feel good.  Thumbs up!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game so much. I even got my grandson interested in it when we put it on the kindle. We like to see who can remove all the card on each level first!
B00BF11STU|3.0|This was an interesting view into some of the background and details on how things played out in the hunt for Bin Laden.  Are they all accurate details?  That's probably debatable, but I went away thinking that it was probably more accurate than not.  I appreciated how it was made to be more realistic than most of the crash-em-up, shoot-em-up action films produced today.  If I could I'd give this movie 3 1/2 stars, because even though I enjoyed it for the reasons above it wasn't necessarily the best made film.  Mainly because the timeline of the story was often a bit hard to follow and not well developed, and the depth of the characters in the story wasn't all that well developed either.  In the end it was worth the rental, but I was glad not to have spent more by going to see it in the theater.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Very good game! One you have to use strategy and it makes it very interesting. You will play it over and over!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|It's been a long time since I read the book, but if memory serves me correctly it seems that this movie does a good job at staying true to the story.  The animation was good and realistic, so while you knew the animals weren't all real you didn't care because they were close enough.  The story told what it had to, did it well, and moved along at a pretty good pace.  All in all it was quite entertaining.<br /><br />If you're a Christian realize that you'll probably have to discuss with your kids the inherent difficulties of co-opting all religions into one, as the main character does.  His father tells him that believing in everything is much like believing in nothing, which is all too true but an issue that the main character never addresses.  But in the end the final message about faith in general is a good one.
B004SBX112|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. It has been a great enjoyment to all of us. Something that the adults and children enjoy playing.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I bought this to use on my motorcycle, which has an iPod cable.  I wanted to be able to connect my Sirius satellite radio receiver to the bike's audio system.  Works great!
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I love Mahjong. I play it often. This one is okay but I seemed to get a little bored with it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I fell in love with The Piano Guys from their You Tube videos. My 11 year old daughter, a beginning cellist, idealizes them! The entire album is great, there isn't one bad song. Enjoy!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|My Grandson plays this a lot. He really enjoys trying to get to the next level before his brother and friends.
B001EO748M|5.0|HAVE THEM ALL-WHAT ALSO WAS SO INTERESTING IS GOING ONTO THE INTERNET AND LEARNING ALL OF THE BACKGROUND OF HIS WIVES
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|The movie was fast paced enough to keep me interested, but overall, it's not that great of a movie.  But, I never saw the original version of Total Recall, so I'm not a fan going into it.  Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale are both good actors in this movie, but Jessica Biel fell flat for me.  But, she usually does, in my opinion.  It's a good action movie if that's what you're looking for, but not a lot of substance there.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|GOOD BACKGROUND FOR THE TUDORS-I HAVE FOLLOWED THE TUDORS AND ALSO READ ABOUT ALL OF THE FAMILY-VERY INTERESTING HISTORY LESSON
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love everything about this movie!  The setting/scenery, the characters, the plot, and the amazing animation.  I love that the girl is a strong, independent character who is still figuring out who she is and how her mother's expectations for her are beginning to clash with what she wants out of life.  There are many hilarious moments and endearing moments in this movie and the ending is really great!  This is one movie I love to watch over and over again.
B003Y059EK|1.0|The video would not play on my desktop nor iPad. This the second and last time I will try using amazon video because this has happened both times
B00AKFG15S|2.0|After reading the entire saga I would not recommend it to a friend. There are better books by the same author
B007REV4T8|2.0|There isn't much of a plot. It's mostly about filming modern buildings all over the world. I've watched it 3 times and haven't stayed awake for the finish. Boring!
0307744434|4.0|You probably won't like this book if:<br />You find it irritating when people say, \\"It's not the destination, it's the journey.\\"<br />You like everything explained and wrapped up by the end.<br />You expect a moral to the story.<br />You find changes in perspective jarring.<br />You like to feel like you know what the hell is going on.<br />You fell that plot is the main thing that makes a book worth reading.<br />You can't get past a paper-thin love story.<br />You can't abide two-dimensional, un-relateable, unrealistic protagonists.<br />You need magic to follow a certain \\"system\\".<br />You're expecting wizard duels.<br />You hate flowery prose and overdone descriptions.<br /><br />You might enjoy this book if:<br />You lose yourself in atmosphere.<br />You enjoy the sensation of not know what the hell is going on!<br />You enjoy characters that are incredibly intriguing and never fully (or even partially) explained.<br />You feel that magic shouldn't follow any sort of clear \\"system\\".<br />You feel changes in writing style and perspective shifts are interesting.<br />You don't mind traveling without a clear destination.<br />You don't stop to smell the roses... you stop to smell EVERY damn blossom you see.<br />You enjoy flowery, unique, and evocative description that often goes on for MANY, many pages.<br />You love the scent of popcorn and caramel apples.<br /><br />My Score Explained:  I think either position outlined above is legitimate and my \\"you-will-like/won't-like\\" review style is to help potential purchasers make an informed decision based off their own likes and dislikes.<br /><br />As you can probably tell from my score, I fall largely in the second camp.  For 90% of my time reading this book I was hopelessly spellbound. The only thing that put a damper on my experience was EVERY scene involving the two protagonists.  I found them to be thin, forced, and uninteresting.  Too perfect, to the point where they became unbelievable/unrelateable.  Every scene with them pulled me out of the otherwise incredibly vivid world the author created.<br /><br />I enjoyed every other character aside from these two.  The author never lets you see all the actions and motivations behind the secondary characters, leaving you to speculate but never KNOW.  I find this delicious!  I appreciate how the author never pulls back the curtain.  The story ends with the spell intact, unlike nearly every other mystical mystery out there where the writer feels the need to explain away the magic.<br /><br />If it weren't for the plot, this book would have received a 5-star rating from me.  As it is, I find The Night Circus to be a 4-star book for me.  I like it (A LOT!), but I don't love it.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|Game of thrones has ruined for me all shows. Now every time I want to evaluate a show, I compare it to game of thrones.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|i bought this movie mostly because of the length its a long movie its got good 3D effects and the only reason i gave it 3 stars is because the british language i cant understand it!!also its not a movie that i normally get into i was going to get the life of pi but ended picking this because its almost 3 hours long so i figured ill get this cause its longer and its hard to find 3D movies that arent childrens movies but if i could pick it over i probably would pick the life of pi thats i think 2 hours any way this movie has good effects and if your into movies like this or harry potter or lord of the rings than i think youll like this movie i could take it or leave it my next 3D im gonna wait till a new movie that i want to see comes out instead  being in a hurry just to see a 3D movie
B00BP4X7TG|4.0|THis was a fine filkm but the stopping and starting of the program, 30 minutes into it every 2 minutes (reloading) made watching more than difficult and disturbing.  I was goiung to call today and ask for a credit but hopefully this email will be sufficient to obtain same.  I have neer had this problem before with Amazon movies.<br /><br />Jeffrey A. Weiner
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We watched Seasons 1-3 in one week. It's an eye-opening glimpse of the separation of classes that existed just a century ago and how that separation changed over one decade. The production is spectacular, starting with the opening scene in Season 1, Episode 1. The characters are perfectly cast, the music is great. I'm impatient to see Season 4 when it's available.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love how easy to use this calculator is and has been a great help in pharmacy class i am taking.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|Blu Ray DVD was exactly as represented in the description.  It arrived quickly and undamaged and played flawlessly on our Blu-Ray Player.
0446580848|4.0|Nelson DeMille manages to share a lot of information about terrorism and the problems in Yemen, along with a tribute to the Americans killed by the bombing of the USS Cole, in a story that builds to an exciting, and not totally-expected ending. That said, DeMille repeats himself a lot, seems to drag the story along as if he is being paid by the word. I almost began to wonder if  his publisher set a minimum page limit. How many times does he need to point out that Yemen sucks, John Corey does not trust his partners, it is hot and that Yemen sucks?<br />This book joins two of DeMille's favorite characters as teammates, former NYPD wisecracker John Corey and former Military investigator Paul Brenner. If you're wondering, Corey emerges as the top dog in this peeing contest.<br />If you love Nelson DeMille, buy the book. The Panther not his best work, but it is still a good read.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|My grandma so enjoys playing this game on her kindle.  Thank you for creating this game to run without internet.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|Great case for my Kindle Touch, looks exactly as pictures. When I lost my old kindle and case, I bought the exact same case because I loved it so much. The material is hard waring, great for lugging around in my handbag and doesn't mark easily. On flat surfaces, the flap is high enough that I can rest my kindle on it to put it at an angle which makes for easier reading. Nice soft inside and bit of extra room that I can put my phone, some money and a few cards in it, when I don't want to take my bag. Could easily fit a kindle with a silicone case on it.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Everybody needs a superhero! An awesome good versus bad movie for the whole family.  We bought this movie at our teenage daughters request, happy we did!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great artist and composition! This is a must buy for those families that have kids that love to dance around.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|A journey through a somewhat dysfunctional family going through a crisis . A detached George Clooney tries to come to terms with the pending death of his estranged wife and the resulting drama of having to reconnect with his children as they adjust. A touching and sometimes funny film it's clooneys best performance to date. Set against the backdrop of Hawaii.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is very fun. its hard not to play.  it seems though as this is a cop-off of zombie highway
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|The film itself was great and is highly recommended.<br /><br />Unfortunately the experience of renting the HD version of the film and streaming it through my PS3 was not good.  The picture and sound quality were below sub-par.  There was a message that said they would use standard definition at times if the connection was lacking, but most of the time it was worse that standard.  I couldn't get the right sound level either - dialog was inaudible and then loud parts were much too loud.<br /><br />I recommend adding a connection test before you rent in HD that says \\"yes you can stream in HD\\" or \\"no, stream in standard definition\\".<br /><br />I've got a wired connection on my TV and don't have a problem with other connected services.<br /><br />For now, I'm going to go back to streaming movies on demand through Comcast.  I'll pay the extra dollar or two for the reliable picture/sound quality.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I kept changing my mind - first I would think &#34;the husband had to do this&#34;, then I would think, &#34;no, he couldn't have done this.  It was someone else.&#34;<br />Such a page turner!!!  Now that I have finished it, I must read it again and savor it.
079073639X|3.0|I wanted to watch this movie not only because I had read the book a long time ago but also because of the cast acting in it. However, I feel like these big stars didn't choose a very good movie to play in. Like I said &#34;it's okay&#34; but you'd get more excitment out of just reading the book
B006IDG2T6|5.0|If the illusion of free will is, itself, an illusion, how can I have an opinion? If that doesn't make you question reality, this book will. Short, easy to read, clear in definitions, well researched.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|This was a great movie demonstrating the attractiveness of a socialist economy during tough times in the US highlighting the life of a real person who did his best to promote it during these rough times. I love dramas anyway and if you do I believe you will find this movie very engrossing
0345803485|5.0|Geat read. I enjoyed this book and the others of the trilogy. It was received in good order and have passed it on to others.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|I love sci-fy and I love Bruce Willis. When you watch this movie you're sure to come to the conclusion that this could actually be in our future considering the way technology is advancing. I'm sure you'll enjoy this flick
B0049VZ222|5.0|Very cool show.  The Standard Def is very acceptable.  No glitches or hitches in streaming.  Well worth it, check it out.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked the book a lot many people don't like this book but I do like th author and the books
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Another awesome show on TV.  This show streamed without any issues and the quality was definitely acceptable.  I recommend it without hesitation.
B001O1O71C|5.0|WHOA this is a great book. GETS boring at first but when you read it gets so interesting. Bruno died in this book with his friend Shmuel. I WAS CRYING. Sorry I spoiled the book
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as brilliant as the first book!  I couldn't put it down, such a page turner ........can't wait to start the next book!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|so I love this app for my kindlefire HD.  I love Ebay anyway so this is even more convenient to check things out to purchase.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I chose this rating because it is how I feel about the Red Marware.<br /><br />It was exactly what I needed to protect my Kindle HD 7.<br /><br />Yes, I would recommend it to others.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Daughter especially likes this game. She is able to start the game as well as get through the different stages.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I totally enjoyed this movie.  It moves a little slow in the middle but it is worth the wait for the action to start again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A relaxing game that is in a way mind boggling but so much fun! The sound effects make me thirsty!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|best book series ever!!<br />so misterious and huge twists, i cant wait to read th  next  book in the series!!!! no spoilers, ill probably finish in one dayif i can.

B00AKFG15S|4.0|Jeffery Archer knows how to keep his readers with facinating stories.  I like his way of combining history and his own characters and stories.  Looking forward to the next one!
1455502758|4.0|a brilliantly sad book of Hitches' final scribblings on a few things that he was still thirsty for: i) wanted to live long enough to see the death of Kissinger, ii) his voice, and his pen iii) himself..A man trapped in a unwanted body in which has to battle with the huge dose of chemo liquid...A man has successfully broke free from his body to continue to write mockery against religion (yes, they are a corrupted business)...beautiful final words from his wife Carol..

B00000AFWW|4.0|On Hole's third album, \\"Celebrity Skin,\\" the band has really come into<br />their own. All of the songs have a strong pop edge, making it their most<br />accessible to date. It is light-years away from their 1991 debut, \\"Pretty on<br />the Inside,\\" which was little more than garage band noise from Olympia,<br />Washington's \\"riot grrrl\\" movement. A more mature record, Courtney Love's<br />anger seems a bit more focused nowadays, with the media and<br />conspiracy-minded sycophants her targets now.<br /><br />  At first listen, \\"Celebrity Skin\\" sounds more lightweight than its 1994<br />predecessor, \\"Live Through This.\\" The new album has a 1970s glam-rock sound<br />to it, but with darker lyrics than anything by Cheap Trick. Love's vocals<br />are much stronger, also: more singing and less screaming. There are a lot of<br />pretty harmonies and melodic verses. Many songs are potential hit singles,<br />with The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan co-writing five of the tunes. His<br />influence may have reached the other songs on the album as well. \\"Northern<br />Star,\\" a lament with strings, has a epic \\"Disarm\\" feel. \\"Use Once & Destroy\\"<br />uses industrial-sounding electronic programming.<br /><br />  There is an underlying feeling of pain and anguish throughout \\"Celebrity<br />Skin,\\" as this is the first Hole album since Kurt Cobain's tragic suicide.<br />The lyrics convey a real sense of despair and confusion. \\"Reasons to Be<br />Beautiful\\" deals directly with her late husband's death\\" \\"And I weep at your<br />feet/and it rains and rains.\\" She answers his Neil-Young-quoting suicide<br />note with, \\"It's better to rise than fade away,\\" in the closing lines of the same<br />song.<br /><br />  The music video for \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is not getting as much airplay as<br />the videos from the last album. This might be due to \\"Courtney backlash\\" and the<br />idiotic conspiracy rumors that infer that she might have had something to do<br />with Cobain's violent death.<br /><br />  \\"Celebrity Skin\\" rocks like a Hole album should, this time a bit more<br />polished and focused. Anyone who likes \\"Lives Through This\\" should like the<br />new album as well. And if you can find it, pick up the import cd single for<br />1993's \\"Beautiful Son,\\" which has three great non-LP tracks.<br /><br />(originally published November 1998)r />  \\"Celebrity Skin\\" rocks like a Hole album should, this time a bit more<br />polished and focused.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|the only reason I didnt give this app a five out of five was because every time I plug in the charger and/or connect my kindle the app opens itself. besides that flaw or thing I love the app!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Few books affect me as this one has. Criticisms of style are quibbles. The essential truths are gems. Thank you, John Green, for bringing these characters and story to life in me, even if they never were alive themselves.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|At the risk of sounding like a broken record, it is poorly written (extremely repetitive, and is just rough sounding) and exhaustingly un-sexy.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Both part 1 and part 2 are great additions to any batman film collection!  I like the actors, however I really didn't like the actor for the joker that much I am a huge Joker fan and I think the Joker could have been captured a little better. I suppose I've been spoiled by Mark Hamil's performances! Anyways aside from the \\"minor\\" Joker disappointment the story is well portrayed and  I really enjoyed this film it's a must see!! for a batman fan! Great film not my all time favorite  but definitely a must have!
0307120007|5.0|I loved this book, my younger sisters loved this book, and my son most definitely loves this book. I knew it was a must for our bookshelf, and he enjoys not only reading it together, but putting the story together in real life (patting his stuffed animals, reading books, feeling his daddy's face, playing with my ring, and he recently figured out the flower one). Like I said, I couldn't imagine his little library without it!
B0040I09RM|4.0|The acting is decidedly sub-par, but I cannot get enough of this show. There are so many great characters. Be careful if you start this, you will want to finish out the whole season in a day.
B005IQZB14|5.0|It seemed as if I was there on the trail as I read this book. I have always loved stories about survival and this book fits that description. Strayed amazed me with her tenacity. I read it practically nonstop to the end and enjoyed it all.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|It is hilarious and educational,with the scientific words that Shelton mentions on each episode.  It is fun watching Pegg keep her cool when Shelton insults her with his special way.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I gave this series 5 stars, because it is so readable. The characters have a reality and the plots are absorbing. The books make far better holiday reading than most books in this genre. Just be sure to have plenty of time, because they are very hard to put down.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|good story and visually stunning, followed book very closely.  the action kept you interested during the whole movie, and enjoyable right up to the end

B001DPHDCY|3.0|This movie is ok.  The story is made long and drawn out  to make a full length movie. My 4yr old grandson lost interest half way through. The book is better.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I saw the movie and cried through the entire show because the music is so beautiful and touching., I just had to have the CD and am very happy to be able to listen to it anytime...and yes - I still cry. . .
B00005JMCN|5.0|This was a wonderful movie. I'm not the least bit interested in horse racing but I enjoyed this movie. The movie is not so much about the horse Seabiscut or racing as it is about the stories of the people involved with Seabiscut. Excellent storytelling. Some brief nudity, some swearing, nothing too bad.
B000005J56|5.0|I watched the documentary of the Buena Vista Social Club a few times...loved the music and am thrilled to have my ow CD now.I<br /><br />When I ordered it, I received a defective CD. Customer Servie at Amazon was terrific and I received a new cd. Loving the musi.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|If you're expecting a PBS Jeremy Brett version of Sherlock this is not your type of movie. If you want a Sherlock that can fight with his fists as well as his mind this is a great movie. This is a very fast paced action movie with an interesting plot. The movie takes great liberty with Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle's writings but Sherlock fans will recognize the characters as well as the story. My husband and I have watched it many times and enjoy it each time.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Good rendition of a Jamie Lee Burke mystery novel.  Good performances.  Great scenery.  Levon helm is a great ghost of a confederate general.

0812993845|4.0|Reading a Sophie Kinsella novel is like eating two pain au chocolat for breakfast - it offers no real nutritive value but is utterly delicious and completely irresistible.<br />Each time I plan a visit to Paris, I vow I will not yield to the temptations of the Patisseries and Boulangeries.  I vow to begin my Parisian mornings with a healthy breakfast of fruit and granola.  Then, with each new dawn, I find myself standing in a shaft of golden sunlight on some narrow cobblestone street, nibbling my forbidden calorie-laden chocolate croissants, like an addict indulging her most base desires.<br />Wedding Night by Sophie Kinsella lacks any real literary substance, and yet it is a thoroughly satisfying, purely indulgent read.  It's the pain au chocolat of the literary world, a sweet little guilty pleasure.<br />It tells the story of two sisters:  Lottie, desperate to marry, and Fliss, bitter after an unpleasant divorce.  Plenty of reviewers have already offered thorough synopsis of Wedding Night, so I won't regurgitate yet another blow-by-blow of the plot.  Instead, I would like to offer my PROS and CONS.<br />PROS:<br />*  Kinsella did a bang up job sketching two characters at different stages in their romantic journeys.  Lottie is the starry-eyed romantic and Fliss is the slightly bitter, skeptical divorcee.  It was fun to transition between the two intertwining plotlines.<br /><br />PROS<br />* The opening scene - where Lottie is expecting to receive an engagement ring and is sadly disappointed - was fantastic.  Hooked me.<br />* The sexual tension between Lottie and Ben was palpable.<br />* I appreciate that Kinsella let us in on Lottie's thought-process - how she went from being angry at one man, agreeing to marry another, and then reviving her affection for the first man. I'll admit, Lottie came off a bit immature and faithless, but I got her because Kinsella put me in her headspace.<br />* Lorcan, the love interest of bitter Fliss, was sexy.  His dialogue was sharp.  I liked him.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* It wasn't as funny as some other books in the genre.<br />* Lead character Ben seemed like a Bipolar Mess.  Hot, but a hot mess.<br />* A whole lotta foreplay and no action.  After all of the hot and heavy session between Lottie and Ben, I was totally let-down by the lack of consummation. Fairly unbelievable considering their crazy chemistry and lust.<br />* Fliss was ridiculous - and her plot to keep Lottie and Ben apart was farcical.p.  I liked him.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* It wasn't as funny as some other books in the genre.<br />* Lead character Ben seemed like a Bipolar Mess.

B007KQI1NA|5.0|It take a little while for the computer or navigation software to first recognize this - but that setup is a &#34;one time&#34; event and then it works great. Eventually I'll get an iPad Mini, but for now, I can take my little 10 in netbook out and find myself on various maps that recognize an external GPS locator. If you are hiking or kayaking - and can keep your electronics dry - the netbook provides a much better map display than the tiny GPS
859037985X|5.0|I'm new to coding and this is a great book for starting to learn how to code pick it up if you can.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|UNO is okay, it took me a moment to figure out the challenge feature (if you have a choice to play a card other than the Draw 4, use it or you will lose the challenge).  I don't like the fact that you cannot put down a Draw 2 on top of one played on you, but must draw the 2 cards.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|If you've never seen this feel-good movie, it is a treat. Well-cast and funny. Simply fun to watch - better the second time through!
B00AGH54XK|5.0|Every trip to NYC I remember that movie... when I was a kid I watched it on Christmas!! Good memories.
0689853491|5.0|This is a favorite of all four of my grandkids.  After a few readings they'll memorize parts and gladly shout them out.  It's a fun story with great illustrations.  It never gets old...  My 11 yr. old grandboy still enjoys it once in awhile.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Tells temperature...Sometimes. First app I put on my new phone, yet frequently &quot;doesn't respond&quot; and shuts down. I thought paying for it would be better than free. Also, I continue to get the &quot;rate this app&quot;. Leave me alone! I paid for this app so it would give me the weather without bugging me. I'm actively looking for a different weather app!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I just love this game!  As a fan of the oldsschool games (Atari, NES), this one was right up my alley. Think Galaga mixed with some Arkanoid and Space Invaders, with some other old school homage thrown in there.  &quot;Easy&quot; level gets mighty challenging by the end, but it gives you 3 difficulty options.  Unlimited lives, which is very nice and adds to the addictiveness.<br /><br />I got this as the FAOTD, but I'd gladly shell out a couple bucks for this (if I believed in spending money on apps).
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I bought this because I got my gf into the show and she wanted to watch them she loves it
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz does not disappoint.  He continues to rock the soul and blues side of his mellow sound.  I cannot get enough of this album and neither will you.
B003L77GHE|5.0|I bought this because I got my gf into the show and we watch it together she is almost at the end of this season
B009HNDCC4|5.0|So perfect, the writing never gets old...<br />Al Bundy at his best, only classic and even better!<br />Each character has perfected each role every season, beyond hilarious!<br />There is not a favorite in this family, each one is so funny and quirky you fall instantly in love!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|City of Ashes and the entire mortal instruments series is one of the best books series that I have read in a long time. She spins a tell of love and lost, danger and bravery, fear and hope. She adds twists that even the most seasoned reader may not see coming, while keeping the story moving.young adults and adults alike will love this story, though I would caution against reading it to really young children, due to the story getting a little dark and complicated at parts. I loved this book and have already gotten my sister (who is 14) and mom to read all of the books as well. I am a college student currently and I still managed to read all five of the books that are out in a little over a week. I'm still recommending this book to everyone I know, and I see some getting the series for Christmas from me.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love the suspense, twists and turns in plot, looking forward to the season finale!  Kevin's character, Ryan Hardy is classic and he plays so well opposite the sick twisted mind of Joe and his cult.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it !!!!! Best game ever. Me my sis and my cousin and my girlfriend play it all the time. U should play it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I thought I might not be able to watch it because &#34;gory&#34; is not my thing... If a friend had not told me about it I would not have even tried it... The plot and the acting are so good that you soon take in the gory as just a means of making you taste the reality of their situation.<br />Cannot wait for the 4th Season!
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day is a real-life account of what it's like to be a Navy SEAL and the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. What follows is a story less like the glorified Hollywood action thrillers and more that of a humble and dedicated team of men who love their country and each other and have made the decision to sacrifice everything to do their job. For anyone interested in the event or military operations, you'll enjoy this book. I was surprised that no mention of the decision to dump bin Laden's body out at sea was made, but otherwise found the book fascinating and am proud to have such honorable men serving my country.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This season is just as good as the first with lots of twists and turns. I am indefinitely hooked on this series
B00005JNX0|5.0|Excellant copy. My grandson was very pleased I bought this for him to watch at my house. A great sale.
B00B2064IY|5.0|As a fan from the olden days, I love this. There has been decades of speculation about where he was going musically, and this helps clarify that for me.
B000Y1CWDS|5.0|I like the movie. The bonus features disc doesn't really have all that much on it though and the extra things that came with it aren't as great as the collectors edition for Spiderman 2. It's still pretty neat and I thought it was worth the price though, it's better getting it here than just out of the $5 bin at Walmart, you get more with this purchase than you would at Walmart.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I like this product very much.  It does just what it says it will do, even while traveling in a vehicle.  Very convenient.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|The new cd is really good, it's not what I was expecting but I really liked it.<br />The &#34;Still into you&#34; song is probably one of the better ones on the album.<br />&#34;Monster&#34; isn't on the CD which I thought was weird, but ok.<br />There's a different sound to most of this album that doesn't sound like the other cds.<br />It's similar but I'd say it's a little less pop like but it is still ovbiously the paramore sound...<br />There are some awesome background singers and some cool new grooves around some of the different songs.<br />&#34;Grow up&#34; is a fun song too.<br />I thought the album cover was kind of ... different... I don't get the paint idea...
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm really not much of a murder mystery reader, but a friend highly recommend this one so I thought I would give it a shot. First I would like to say this was a superbly written novel. The story is so captivating that I had trouble putting it down! I just had to see how it was going to play out. Although the ending kind of left me with a lot of unanswered questions, I was still satisfied and would recommend this book. The writers imagination is OFF THE HOOK!!!! I guess you really don't know what goes on inside the head of the person you think you know the most , don't let the negative reviews sway you on this one! Read it for yourself and you'll be surprised!!
B008DK3QBY|5.0|Interpreting Beethoven means Barenboim. I advise everybody to buy this records for their archieve.<br />This is a valuable pack and must have !
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|amazing movie~!~ bazillion thumbs up! Unique film with major moments of &#34;did that just really happen&#34; thoughts! a must see for sure
B00A3AY134|5.0|3 Doors Down is a good rock band. All the hits are on this download. The two new songs are well done too. Well worth the purchase.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|I got this because it the Facebook app popped up saying I should try it and found that I never used it.
B009O2XY12|1.0|did not lord on my phone did not like  like the game but does not play on my phone hate it
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook itself was an awesome attempt at getting people to communicate on a large scale, but really its just a place for people to perpetuate the fake facade they show the world claiming it to be who they really are. God help me I hope the world isn't full of fake narcissistic people.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|the app did not work on my phone did not like the app would not buy it or tell any one about it
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I have said it before, and I will say it again, puzzle games are the best for tablets. Other game formats are cumbersome at best, and aggravating for the most part. Games such as this are the best,and most enjoyable form of killing time with your tablet.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love it is great to use when I am bewteen meeting or appointments have played it for hours thank you
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Interesting game. The only problem I saw was the battery consume, but that's a problem with almost every app on the Kindle Fire so... It's good.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I am by no means an expert in science fiction, but I loved this book.  I am so pleased that Amazon reviewers rated this book so highly.  Read it and you will be glad you did. Patti
B008476HBM|5.0|I completely fell in love with the book. It is a very good adaption for the Kindle Fire. Keep the good work!
B00BAVCD8A|1.0|It's insulting when poser, grease bands use words like \\"save Rock N Roll\\" in their album titles or songs when they do not even possess the skill required to Rock, YES there is a required skill hence why 99% of the stuff on the radio these days sucks, it is not rock, nor does it possess any required skills. I Simply put it's just poser garbage like fall Out Boy.  So yes, save rock and support real rock bands not this shat out, radio friendly, poser garbage.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|i love sci-fi it is in my blood there is nothing like it i will be buying more movies soon
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I spent hours and hours on my favourite game!<br />Very funny and playable.<br />A real must to put on your device.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love love love this game. Its cute and addictive. I haven't stopped playing it since I've downloaded it on my phone and now i have a second reed on my kindle works well on both. Especially since I am very very pregnant i'm home and playing whenever I get a chance.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This has to be the most awesome game I have played as of yet...and I have played many Impressive ones.... the artistry is the best....thank you Fireproof...I await your next endeavor...
B00170I7GG|5.0|So, if this doesn't resonate with you then you must be asleep. Any human being with self awareness realizes this movie beautifully captures how we work. All the levels of complexity that come with the journey from ego centric to loving are accurately and humorously depicted with great storytelling. Opened my heart in an unusual way.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is one of those albums that must be listened to many times. No hit singles here. Just really good and inspired esoteric tunes done with an expertise that is rare. It speaks of desperation and hopelessness. Which seems pertinent to the state of the world.
B005CGI3ZG|4.0|It's good, but I was expected more, because it not in the all episodes has subtitles in English, that's why it needs.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie! I went out and purchased it a few days later and will enjoy watching it again.
1439107955|5.0|i LOST SEVERAL FAMILAIRS OF CANCER AND WAS INTERESTED IN KNOWING MORE ABOUT THIS DISEASE BUT ALL THE BOOKS i FOUND WERE TOO SCIENTIFIC WITH EXPLANATIONS AND TERMINOLOGY THAT i (BEING AN ENGINEER) HAD NO IDEA ABOUT. tHIS BOOK GAVE ME WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, WITH SIMPLE WORDS. THE AUTHOR IS CLOSE TO US AND WE FELL AS IF WE WROTE THE BOOK WITH HIM.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|This was a really cute movie and was a great movie for our family movie night. Hope this review helps ;-)
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Better than the usual dystopian or teen- centered stuff on the market.  Hope IS the only thing stronger than fear.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game is cute and all, fun easy to play. But it does require money. If you want to continue playing you need to buy gems or else you cannot move forward for a very long time. You will get the gems... eventually.<br /><br />The game is also very glitchy. I have restarted 5 times. The first few times I was at low levels and I thought it was because I did not exit properly. I guess I should have realized then this was not a good game, bit it is addictive. The last time it restarted me itself. I was on the last level about to get the last pony!<br /><br />I contacted customer service and they said they could not get me back to where I was, but would compensate me for the real money I lost. So far they have yet to do so and so I am writing this review.<br /><br />The game is cute but don't bother spending real money because you wont get it back when you glitch. And don't bother with CS, they are unlikely to get back to you if you have an issue. I would love to give Gameloft 0 stars, but I cant. I liked the game, but now I am sticking with Smurfs Village.
B0039TD826|5.0|One of my favorite recordings of all time.  Think the &#34;Remastered&#34; version sounds great.  Almost every track is great!!!  Especially like the very fast and very slow tracks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is not for thoselooking for a harlequin...<br /><br />the books are very well written with a few British tweaks. You will be hooked after the first chapter. I read the entire trilogy in a week!<br /><br />Its a must read for any woman!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally solid acting by all, great location shots & photography. Can't wait for the next season. I'll easily watch reruns in the meantime.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is one of the best written shows on t.v. today! I missed this one episode and was excited to watch before the season finale.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Love this movie = great wit and outstanding acting. The acting & quick lines remind me of the Taylor/Burton days gone by.
B000002ADT|4.0|His greatest album; one of the great recordings in jazz. Miles was an innovator from start to finish and you can't go wrong when you include such luminary icons as John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I have been a huge Crue fan since I was a teenager (if only my parents knew what they were buying me!). I actually started reading \\"This is Gonna Hurt\\" first, simply because I love the type of photography that Nikki captures, so I wanted to read up on it.  I loved the book!  Since \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" was referenced, I decided to purchase it as my next read so that it all made a little more sense. Nikki was right....I am still asking myself how in the hell this man is still alive?! But I am very glad that he is. He is doing wonderful, healthy things now with & in his life, which is a huge inspiration not only to me, but thousands of others. Thank you for sharing your story, Nikki.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Me and my grandchildren really Love playing this game. We love the challenge. It is really fun and exciting we love all the different ponies.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Always loved it. Draws me in every time. I've read it at least twenty times since the sixth grade. Top five favorite books of all time
B008OOYALE|1.0|This is the poor country cousin to the Apple device one... You don't have the same content and this one keeps dropping you off the game..I have less then half the friends on this one that I have on my iPhone Dragon Story and it takes me twice as long to visit them.  If you complain you get a form letter and nothing is done...
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always liked playing mahjong and this gives me added opportunity. I am a senior citizen and it is one of the many ways I use to keep my mind occupied and alert.
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|Good story and the best part is that there is no merchandising to go with it. Think of that just a movie!
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|The portrayal of Lincoln is of a man that seems to be operating under the influence of pharmaceuticals.  He was weighed down by events, but that weight is overplayed. The remaining figures are cartoon caricatures, with the exception of Sally Field who is most believable as Mary Lincoln. And you know this is a politically.correct film - note the saintly black (well, sort of) servants to the Lincoln family and the unneeded portrayal at the end of Thaddeus Syeven's black housekeeper and mistress. Shot in gloomy dark tones and soft focus, this movie was truly disappointing.
B005DI66N4|2.0|I've just finished this book.  It's a fun yarn but I found it hard to believe.  I've had the experience of being lost in a hot desert without water for two days.  I was young, well fed, in good shape and used to hiking that terrain.  By the end of the second day I was hallucinating and incapable of rational thought. If I hadn't stumbled across a pool, I would have died the next day. In this book, they traverse the Gobi desert doing two stretches without water for over a week. There is also a lot of personal information missing.  Men under that kind of stress become very close and share confidences.  No one talks about his wife, his job before the war nor are there any grievances or stories about interaction with the guards some of whom may have been kind or cruel.  There is a strange kind of void about this topic.  And then there were the Yeti's which was just too much.  Their odessy is just one amazing, barely possible story after another.  How many near miracles in tandem can one believe? After reading the book I googled the book and found there is good reason to be skeptical about this story.
158270208X|5.0|This is basically a blank book for you to record thing in.  But it has a flap and looks expensive.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book is original, funny and engaging. The only reason it took me two days to read is because I rationed myself. I just bought a copy for my girlfriend too.
0425170349|1.0|Wooden characters, implausible plot, long tracts of political rhetoric. I like the John Clark character from Clancy's other books and was looking forward to this. I got about halfway through the book and threw in the towel. This book is more about ridiculing ignorant liberals and environmental extremists than setting up the Rainbow anti-terrorist unit.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Old Columbo has the world by the tail and in a spin, He never quits and gets his man/woman in the end!
B00B97SNJI|4.0|This is a great CD, but my least favorite song by far is \\"Hey Lover\\". Other reviewers really like it, but the repetitive chorus was just plain irritating. Weakest songwriting of the CD for me, but I appear to be odd man out.
B005HSL626|5.0|it was cool and stuff i loved it but.... this is a lil off topic but there needs to be more FREE mlp games well love the game and Bronies unite
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I am not great on movie reviews for I don't think going into too much detail would be redundant and take away from you seeing it for yourself. But all the rumors were true, this was a really good movie.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I give it five stars because the story was kept close to the original. Great actors, great effects and gadgets, and most importantly, it made the almost three hours it lasts seem like they were less than two...great movie!
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Disney's twisted portrayal of true love is mine too!  The artists are spot on with Aerial's measurements and writers don't miss a beat with her personality.  There's just something magical about her loving a guy before he even has to talk to her.  Aerial's fascination over the statue of a man is admirable as well, and while he's away could help keep her faithful.  Plus the fact that she cannot talk only adds to this mystical story of what real love can be.  My unique desire remains unfulfilled in real life, but lives on forever in this breathtaking fairytale.  A must own for all (except impressionable little children), 5 stars!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|eye opener... this book was read after his death and really made his tragic death much more painful...  The book gave me a great respect for those that serve and have served.  RIP .. Chris Kyle

B0014E917Y|5.0|That's right it's just The Coppola Restoration Only- I purchased this Item last year only to be misled by IMDb thinking it was The Godfather Trilogy 1901-1980 finally on dvd for the first time. Please be advise that it is not. It's just a region 2 set which means you need a region-free dvd player to play it. It will not work on our standard region 1 players here. The restoration is still the same as our U.S versions here with all 3 versions and the extra disc containing the special features as well. IT IS NOT THE GODFATHER TRILOGY 1901-1980. If your looking for it, you can find it on VHS on amazon.com.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I love the action, romance and all of it. It is the,by far, best book I've ever read.
B0075HP2K4|5.0|Beautifully haunting, mesmerizing music. She has a naturally beautiful voice, and uses it well. Piano adds so much to it.
B007US9NA8|5.0|Great book what made me like it is that it has all you need to start or get better at bodybuilding.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Great purchace, My wife loved it very much. You cant beat the price and the movie is not bad either.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Exciting and fast pace moving game. Hand and eye coordination is strongly needed in this game. I love it! Everyone should try it.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|As always Ian Mcewan puts forth an impressive tale.His descriptions of government types and offices brings forth the despair often found with lower level employees. One in particular comes to mind the Department of Motor Vehicles.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I love this game it is pretty good and fun the only thing is that it needs Internet that's the only thing actually hmm.
B0031RAOVY|3.0|This movie is a tear-jerker and I am surprised it was not released in U.S. theaters. I think it could have been better adapted to the time period,<br />1996-2008, it portrayed. The first part of the movie which portrays the dog's early years is appropriate but after the Gere character dies the dog is released into the streets to live the last ten years isof his life in a densely populated area. This is not realistic in today's society. We know from an early scene when Haichi was a pup the local shelter euthanizes strays after 2 weeks if not adopted. The Gere character was great but after that it is ridiculous to think that in today's society Haichi would havr survived that long in an era of leash laws and pooper scooper laws. Awesome dog, stupid people, and a very sad touching movie based on a true story.
B002Q6OHAK|5.0|This album just doesn't stop.  It's raw and unrelenting.  One of the best rap albums I've heard in a long time...and yes, it's almost 20 years old.
B00C1BTWV4|3.0|This movie was a good movie I wanted my grandson to see it . He thought it was okay he wanted to see it before thinking of seeing the new 3-D movie.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Love Train.  Have all of their CDs.  Don't really have a favorite.  I've downloaded them on my PC, android phone and then to my phone.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Great to have videos of entire season.  Enjoyed watching episodes again. Can watch with or without comments and closed caption.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The book was a good read but left you wanting more for Megan. I would have liked for them to start the family.
B00CBRH4YU|4.0|Terrence Malick returns home to pay homage to Bartlesville, where we both grew up. But his return is sterile, finding that there's nothing there for him, despite the beauty, cleanliness, friendliness. All of the major characters search for connection without success. While the photography was beautiful, it had a home movie feel. I was fascinated, but then the story belongs to me.
B003AND1L4|5.0|MUY BUEN PRODUCTO
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book, especially after Bella becomes a vampire...less mopey. However, I would have liked to have the actual book cover as a cover of this Kindle book.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I think that this is a great book. You should definitely buy it. I loved it. It is very funny
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Watched the movie first and they are both great but this book is better, with a lot more details. Great job!
B009IF7V2S|5.0|great movie, always a classic, good entertainment, fun to catch up on this movie after not seeing it for quite a while now
0425263908|5.0|This book was definitely sizzling. I'm surprised my mailbox didn't burn down before I got the book out of it. Seriously, the romance, storyline, and the characters blend into a well written book. Not a book for the teenagers in your house to read or if you are easily offended, this isn't the book for you (well, unless you hide it from the teens).
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Lots of blood, but the way it was done was great.  Sorry for those people that were looking for a history lesson, but this was just entertainment.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Didn't really know what to expect with this book but it was good. Think I will try the second book in the Nikki Heat series.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss writes of love and women like one who has loved someone till it hurts,  With a truly open heart.  Most of us only love like that once.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Everyone should read this book, especially if they have seen the Disney version on film. The actual story is of course, much better.

B004LROUNG|5.0|I hadn't read a Grisham mystery in quite a while. This one was good - solid drama with some real-life struggles of a down-to-earth lawyer in a totally new environment.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Unless you're and audiophile and can discern the slightest differences of audio I really feel like this amplifier did not help much. Maybe I was naive in assuming this would improve audio quality by a ton but nothing of the sort happened. Yes you can tell that there is a slight boost in audio quality but for most people this will be just another inconvenience for minimally better audio quality. I'd suggest saving the money to invest in better quality headphones.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|I instantly saw a massive improvement in the quality of this old classic.  The DVD doesn't come close any more, and the colors, sounds and feel had us jumping just like it was 1975 all over again.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A fantastic read. A really well paced book, with superb character development. really unusual.<br />Although a different style I recommend to readers of Tracey Chevailer, Peter Carey and Rachel Joyce.
B00787IR2Q|4.0|a relic from the age of actual cinematic tricks, no CGI, just good old fashioned trick photography and some funny acting.  Of course, there's the cliche distracted dad and what parent would find time to sleep if their kids were subterranean, but it's worth a watch.

B009KEN87O|5.0|This reminds me of games that I used to play in the arcades of the late 70's and early 80's. It is very hard to put down. Lots of fun and good memories for someone who played some of the original games. I hope you have some good memories and make some more.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|after reading this book it almost makes going to vegas and meting random people even better, you never know what will happen, expecially for Megan Scott who woke up married to a stranger. After convincing her to give the marrage a try she eventually falls in love with this man and gives up everything, but Conor is not letting her get away that easy
B0054XOMX4|5.0|I bought Orion for myself, yes, nerd, loves super fast tops, so what. This Beyblade is undefeated so far. I have learned that you have to keep the Phantom track and Fusion Wheel, the only thing that is changeable is the energy ring and I am finding that the Big Bang Pegasus Energy ring gives it more stability then ever. This Bey is totally worth it and is a great buy so long as you don't drop the spin track on anything besides the stadiums themselves.
1934030198|5.0|I read this book off and on.  I am new to the sport and have my first mini-tri in about a month.  I'll read this book in spurts.  It is especially nice for when I hit a wall in training and need to get a little extra push in terms of motivation.  I can read about the science of the body and what might be causing my lack of motivation, then all of a sudden, I feel like getting back out there.

B0030V0PEW|5.0|This is a great book for all. No matter what you do in your life, this is a must read. Even those who feel like they don't do anything 'important' need to read this.<br />I will be buying this for family members.

1400069289|4.0|I felt the author spent more time on the &#34;well, duh&#34; part of habit science than needed, but overall found the examples to be highly informative and fascinating.

B003VS0CYC|5.0|I am a Robocop nut and when I saw this set I could not help myself but to buy it, have yet to open it up and watch it as I haven't had the heart to break the seal......not to mention I have about 20 other copies and versions of this moive to choose from in my collection i can watch lol
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros:<br />* 7 speaker sound is actually pretty noticeable<br />* Software speaker driver was easy to set up<br />* Battery life is acceptable (Only runs out on weekends when I probably should be taking a break anyway)<br />* Wireless range is fine (Covers most of my house.  Be sure to put the USB stick away from your PC using the included cable, or you will get interference)<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Sometimes the driver gets &#34;stuck&#34; and no amount of cycling the power on the headphones will fix it.  For whatever reason, the G930 output device can't receive sound in windows.  Other outputs like speakers still work fine when switching to them, but the windows 7 mixer won't show any sound being output for the G930 device.  Leaving the device on and plugged in seems to cause this issue almost every time.  I can't figure out how to fix this without unplugging the USB stick.  Luckily the stick connects quickly (a few seconds)<br />* Headset is kind of plastic-y.  Normally I wouldn't care about this (plastic is light!), but certain vocal pitches apparently match the harmonic frequency of the plastic and cause it to rattle while you are talking...<br /><br />?:<br />* There shouldn't be a hardware mute button if you can mute by moving the mic
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This is a great game, but I'm pissed and won't play it because I just unlocked the T-Rex but I have to BUY it for $490 game dollars which means I have to spend $49.99 real USD to get him. Nobody will have that much money unless you are going to spend real money...and a lot of it. This is another nickel and dime game. I've actually already spent about $20 real dollars buying stuff in the game lol. It's unfortunate they would deny us the best dinosaur ever unless you have real money to spend. Disappointed big time.
B0047VSW30|5.0|I READ A REVIEW SOMEWHERE OR ON AMAZON THAT STATED THAT THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE BEST REPRESENTATIONS OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION  HISTORICALLY . I saw the movie for that reason as i am interested in philosophy , science and especially the historical religious views that are due for exposure and adaptation /change from what was originally taught by teachers and to reveal how their teachings were distorted to enslave the populace and keep them UN-empowered. I do think this movie did a fine representation of that but it was worth viewing for much more that it encompassed and regardless of your interest or personal views of science or religion. It has much to offer in its storyline, its characters, and its portrayal of the times and humanity itself then and now and always.  The portrayal of a beautiful and powerful woman who was greatly deeply and truly loved and was a magnificent teacher with a extra-ordinary mind and a lot of compassion and wisdom...also a powerful leader  (great for both men and women to see this example)....These as well as the themes within the main theme...of science vs religion...and religions against one another..the portrayal of love, loyalty, betrayal, human emotions and fears, truth and education, passion for what is right, and so on....encompassing a wide range of representations and varying view points of these in an interesting and well done performance and visually well-accomplished work. Finally the kind of prejudice woman historically have withstood and conquered or succumbed to, is also nicely portrayed in this film and gives a really powerful representation of how a woman can stand in her own power and how truth and knowledge and a keen and inquiring mind is a power and a strength that may not easily succumb to the intimidation of those who use  even the most vile means of physical abuse and such qualities and kind of power may lead others in victory even under such oppressive circumstances. And finally that victory may be defined in many different ways and that is a personal choice not one that someone should rely on anyone else;s criteria for or they will suffer the consequences of a life chosen for and not by them which is really never a victory at all even if it appears to be in view of the populace (or popular opinion).
0547848412|5.0|I only read the book after I had watched the movie. Even though the movie did a great job and stayed true to the book, reading the book was still as satisfying and pleasant as I had hoped. The writing was vivid, beautiful and powerful.

B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Many people loved Volbeat's last album. I liked but did not love it like many. This is the album I was hoping to get last time. There is no weak track. Every song feels independent and different. If you want awesome music this is a must have.

B00B2PHSIY|4.0|The GoPro Hero3 Red Dive Filter-Snap On Accessory for GoPro Hero3 Black is an excellent product at an affordable price.  It has a white string/lanyard to attach it to the camera.  Be careful with this as mine came loose upon entry into the water but was retrieved by the dive master.  Now I secure the lanyard to the camera mount with a stainless steel fishing leader.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is hard to put down.  I'm not even into military prose and I was fascinated by what I read.  The elite soldiers of our country deserve our most enthusiastic praise and gratitude for the countless hours of sacrifice they give us every day.  Read this book and understand just how courageous these men are.  And not because they got bin laden, but because of the hardship and toil these men are enduring every hour of every day.  For America

B008JFUO4U|3.0|Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) chose to take a very operatic approach to this story which is based on a comic book written by Kosinski and Arvid Neslon and a screenplay adapted again by Kosinski, Karl Gajdusek (Tresspass, Dead Like Me) and Michael Arndt ( Toy Story 3, Star Wars VII).<br /><br />The look and feel of the film is smooth and clean while the drama flows in the same direction and slowly, very slowly unfolds to reveal the truth about the people on Earth and a catastrophic event left earth just barely alive. The moon was destroyed, although we don't know how, and that was the beginning of the end for Earth.<br /><br />Tom Cruise (Top Gun, Jack Reacher) plays an astronaut Jack who is assigned to repair and maintenance of drones that protect a machine that basically turns our seawater into energy for a the population of earth which has `apparently' moved to a moon of Saturn after an alien attack. It was an alien war in which Earth apparently won or so the audience is lead to believe.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Dolphin Tale) plays an unsuspecting prospector of many who holds the truth of what really happened. His command of the scenes he is in makes you believe what he says, although unbelievable at first, it could be true. I can't give away the reasons or what he represents without spoiling the film for you, but - spoiler - everything is not what it seems to be.<br /><br />Two really good, sedate but powerful performances come from Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace, Hitman) as a mission specialist with a history with Cruise's character that will defiantely surprise you - and the second performance comes from Andrea Riseborough (Shadow Dancer, Resistance) playing the woman in Cruise's life who along with maintaining the technical aspects of communication is also his partner in life.<br /><br />The ships, probes, drones, vehicles and even the finale with the surprise orbiting station is visually impressive. The action sequences are intense and by the second hour it seems like a nonstop action/adventure film filled near misses and explosions.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" has an interesting and dynamic musical score to accompany the visuals by M.8.3., a pop/rock group with composer Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese that really captures the `feel' of what is going on. The movie really begins to take flight really in the second half of the film but it does have the widescreen epic motif that allows the audience to ask questions and just about almost all of them are answered. Others are not. Overall it's a good film, but not something that will have a long standing in the theatres. I am sure it will work better on Blu Ray, because it is a little long-winded, but the visuals are stunning at times.intense and by the second hour it seems like a nonstop action/adventure film filled near misses and explosions.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" has an interesting and dynamic musical score to accompany the visuals by M.8.3., a pop/rock group with composer Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese that really captures the `feel' of what is going on.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This isn't a tragedy, but is inspired by young love and star crossed paths as in Shakespeare's play, which is referenced in the novel. Rowell writes beautifully about adolescent angst and adult concerns, of finding your pace and finding hope in someone when those you should trust betray you.  It seems like such a simple story: two teens meet and their lives change, all set against the backdrop of the awful, helpless high school years. Rowell understands emotions, humor, longing and regret, as well as the folly of the world.  Funny, moving, wonderful. I loved this book.
B006O6F932|3.0|This is ok, it is a lot of money for so little.  6 yr old loves it, especially the lockers.  It isn't much, but basically walls. no furniture.  Half the money it would feel better.

B000VUCIZO|5.0|Really enjoyed reading it. The way Woz described building his devices and then later Apple I and Apple II is just extraordinary. I think every student who is into engineering or science should read it because it describes how a great engineer should think and approach problems.

B000000OAH|5.0|First of all, apologies to Paul Simon for the mangled use of his song title.  Onward...<br /><br />I am all for diverse opinions.  The great thing about opinions is that they are neither right, or wrong; they are just what the individual thinks.  Let's face it: some people love one thing, some another - but neither is wrong.  That said, I bought this album back in '78 when it was first released, and to this day it remains my absolute favorite Queen album.  Is it their best?  Heck no - for that see Queen II.  But I digress - this album is so full of variety, ballads - and rockers - and mid-tempo - and even some white funk ... it has a little bit of everything.  Not that I am making comparisons, by any means, but as I listened to this album I was reminded of Sgt.Pepper - only in the respect that one single band made so many successful attempts at various genres - on one lone album - and came out winners.  For me, nothing feels forced here; there is conviction in every note on the album.  Sadly, \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" hinted at the dreck which was to come (not a big fan of \\"The Game\\" here), and it was obvious that a more pop-oriented stance was being taken.  It rather seemed to me that after \\"Jazz\\", too much ambition was sacrificed to make way for what would sell rather than what would be beloved.  But anyway...<br /><br />That's just my take on this album.  I thought it was great back in 1978 (and was fortunate enough to see the JAZZ tour), and I enjoy it just as much today.  I disagree with anyone who might say that this is for die-hard fans only.  On the contrary, I think this is a great intro to a little bit of everything Queen was capable of.

0062059963|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this sequel. The Elite picks up right where The Selection left off obscuring the transition from one book to the next. The pace is about the same, perhaps a little faster in some spots, but all necessary details are included as to not leave the reader in want. The storyline was neat and tight and Cass took time to develop the characters more so we can get to know them on a new level. She also expounds on the history of Illea and the rebels in the North and South, making it easier to understand them while still being shrouded in a bit of mystery.<br /><br />The books begins where America has decided that Maxon is the man that she wants to spend the rest of her life with. She settles into the idea of palace life and begins imagining her future with him, that is, until the unthinkable happens. An event so personal and momentous that America begins to question if Maxon is who he says he is and whether or not the secrets she has uncovered through hidden diaries could mean that she and the rest of the nation have been lied to for hundreds of years.<br /><br />In an act of anger and defiance, America publicly unveils some of these secrets and as a result her time in the palace is ordered to come to an end, her time with Maxon and Aspen over, and the chance to create great change smothered before the flames of rebellion have time to ignite and spread.  That is, until, peculiar circumstances keep her in the palace, but new powerful enemies are watching her every move. Despite it all, America and secret allies aren't going to back down without a fight for those they love and a nation that needs to know the truth.<br />I can't divulge too much of what happens between America, Aspen, and Maxon because it would ruin much of the reading experience for you, but I will tell you that by the end of The Elite America has made a final decision as to who she wants to spend the rest of her life with. I am anxious to know what happens in the final installment of this series.<br /><br />POSSIBLE NEGATIVES FOR THOSE ON THE FENCE WITH THE FIRST BOOK<br /><br />If you didn't like the drama in the first book you won't like the second book. The emotional roller-coaster between Maxon and America  magnifies due to various events that occur throughout the book.  America is still very indecisive about her feelings toward Maxon and Aspen and becomes even more so toward the end. Maxon almost seems superhuman with his level of patience with America, which at times seems unrealistic. Had I been in his shoes, I probably would have sent her home early on. But if you are a hopeless romantic, like me, these emotional outbursts can be forgiven.<br /><br />There is more of \\"The Bachelor\\" feel in some of the interactions and situations the girls, Maxon and America find themselves in. If you didn't care for that feel in the first book, you most likely won't care for it in the second as it is more pronounced as the competition heats up.<br /><br />Even though the history of Illea comes out further, it is still not a true dystopian although it does carry some qualities of the dystopian genre. I guess the best way I would describe it is more of a mild or quasi-dystopian, because the forced repression of the citizens of Illea, the north and the south is discussed further, and a full blown rebellion does seem to be an upcoming event in the 3rd book. If you prefer hardcore dystopian books like Hunger Games, Brave New World, 1984, or Divergent, you may be left feeling frustrated and disappointed.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|The Unit does what its supposed to do....amplify sound. I was hoping it would be a bit more louder .... but for the Price you cant really go wrong. So If you are looking to pick up sounds a bit louder than the norm without spending a Arm & A Leg....then this Amp will do the trick.
B000063UR2|5.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorites!  I am shocked to hear that some people have not seen it.  Any fantasy lover on your list will fall in love with this story of innocence and  temptation.  A kid like Tom Cruise and a delightfully evil Tim Curry make this dreamlike story a fun filled experience for the whole family.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I have all of the DVD's put out by Celtic Woman and each one is some of the best music in the world.  They are a group of joyful, independent Irish women who, according to the making of \\"Believe\\" - \\"Irish women are independent, head of household and when they perform they demonstrate their independence but when they are together, they experience only the joy that can be had by women. (Lisa Kelly in her own words).  Also, a side note, if you have a dog who does not sleep much at night and drives you nuts, try this dvd.  My younger pup lays down at the bottom of my bed when I put in a Celtic Woman DVD and stares at the computer screen when I play one of these dvds and wags his tail and eventually falls asleep - may work with kids too.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|An example of sci-fi at its best, Wool presents a clear and plausible environment that has internal integrity, a suspenseful story and a thought-provoking denouement.  Excellent.
0790731479|5.0|This is exactly what I ordered. The original movie. This one is better than the special anniversary edition that has things cut out of the movie.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|The story needed more character development. I understand that the studio is planning a sequel. If it is done well, the relationship between our main characters should improve. This film entertained, but you were left with the feeling of, okay,where is the rest of the story!
B000I0QL82|5.0|I bought this for my wife who is not much of a movie person, but who loves the classics!  We watch this movie several times each winter, and of course around Christmas and New Years!
1452115567|5.0|I first met Theron last year as he and Maddie were passing through Dallas. At the time I was already familiar with the beautiful images he was creating and posting on instagram of Maddie on things. But what I didn't expect was how warm hearted Theron himself would be. Having him and Maddie stay in our home for an evening was a true honor. And now getting to see all the great success that is deserved for both Theron and Maddie makes me smile. This book is the perfect conversation starter around our house, and that's why we leave it proudly sitting on our coffee table. Buy it for a friend. Buy it for your grandma. It's a fun book to flip through at any age.
B00BAVCD8A|2.0|This is really hard for me to write.  I am a die-hard FOB fan and I love their earlier work.  Unfortunately this album did not live up to my expectations.  Listening to FOB's older CDs you can hear a natural growth and progression in the sound and lyrics.  However, this album is a complete departure from FOB's classic sound.  \\"The Phoenix\\" and \\"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark\\" are the only two songs that actually sound like FOB.  The rest of the album feels like it's all over the place.  Half of the CD is just collaborations with other artists, which I feel like is overkill.  I don't care for the soul/pop infusion sound at all.  After a lot of hype and excitement about this album it just did not meet my expectations.  My advice is download the first two tracks, and maybe the last one, \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" featuring Elton John, but skip the rest.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|The only problem I have is it can be expense to upgrade. It's hard to move forward if you don't purchase upgrade.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|DIDNT LIKE THE WAY BATMAN WAS PORTRAYED IN THIS ONE......I GUESS IT WASNT COMIC BOOK ENOUGH FOR ME. OUT OF ALL THE MOVIES THIS IS MY LEAST FAVORITE

0425252868|5.0|This was one of the best books on WW2 that I have read........the last pages brought tears to my eyes.......I highly recommend it<br /><br />Robert A
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|If you watch this movie, do yourself a favor and skip the first 30-40 minutes. It's so boring and adds very little to the rest of the movie. I like Bilbo and Gandolf, but all of the others on the quest are forgettable. Unlike LOTR where you had cool characters like Legolas and Aragorn, you have annoying dwarfs who break into song at different times. The action isn't as good as LOTR either. They mostly just run away from danger the whole time. And seriously, how has nobody killed Smiegel yet?!!?
B003WKOU0G|4.0|A voice over explaining a few things would have added to the movie I think but overall, It was really cute
0399226907|5.0|As a former teacher I love giving this book as a gift. The butterfly and the caterpillar and the book The Hungry Caterpillar make a wonderful gift for baby showers, births, birthdays etc. Very pretty colors to delight the youngest child and the caterpillar is so, so soft. The butterfly puppet can be used as a bedroom decoration hung over a crib when not being used as a 'prop' for reading the book. I have given this twice and the parents have been delighted. I would recommend and will surely give these again for the next baby.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I just needed a simple calculator on my kindle fire, this works great, it is free to use and easy to use!  I love it!
1451695195|5.0|My love of this book has more to do with medicine/science than with the main premise. Alexander has a remarkable ability to explain scientific and medical topics. I would love to be in his classroom--on ANY subject.<br /><br />His explanation of his near death experience, with his brain cortex not functioning, was intriguing. However, his description of various areas &#34;off-planet&#34; were a little creepy. In that case, I hope the Bible's statement, &#34;In my house are many mansions&#34;, is a truism. I would hope my &#34;mansion&#34; is different from Alexander's!<br /><br />I would recommend this book because of his deep insights into many after-life questions and the medical knowledge he shares. Also, it moves quickly, igniting a desire to read the whole book in one sitting.
B008LA7RM0|5.0|When it was released, Pet Sounds was said to be artistically the best album that the Beach Boys recorded, but for some reason I never bought it.  It does have a sound very different from the other Beach Boys recordings, and I am thoroughly enjoying it.
B000002UVX|5.0|Have this album on vinyl and it's great.  All of the original Hendrix albums are better than any of the posthumous releases.  Needed to spend a few dollars to get free shipping and found this CD for $4.99.  SCORE!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|fine
B005DWA5KK|5.0|The scenes are eye catching, nothing is level or flush; no parts of them are simple. The music is complex and bizarre; the sound effects give you chills. The clarity of the cells is pretty startling but there are still enough imperfections and shaking to remind you that are watching moving history. A bargain for what I paid for a movie I've read about for many-many years. Now I know what all the fuss was about!
B0098460O4|5.0|I don't know why I feel as I do, and cannot explain my reaction to this CD. Like a lot of people, I saw the YouTube video of Jonathan and Charlotte's audition on Britain's Got Talent.  I was emotionally affected by their story and their song. I am a 54 year old woman who has never liked this type of music before.  I bought the \\"Together\\" CD and have played it over and over.  I know no Italian, but the songs speak to me and I find myself in tears.  There is just something about Jonathan's voice that touches me.  I follow them on Face Book and care about them as if they were my children.  I've never reacted to a CD like this before. Sounds crazy, huh?  But if you read the Face Book posts, I am not the only one.  Hope they will tour the US and put out another CD soon.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|very poor in subject matter and language and I do not recommend this film for a general audience. The artistic value is good.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It won't download to the next icon. I like the game though. I'm a part of gameloft live to. Bits and gems are easy to collect. Note, you only  get gems if you tap the pony in the box, level up, and occasionally from turning shards into bits.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Could not put this book down!! Went to sleep late more then once and I paid for it in the morning, but it was so worth it!! The ending so was unexpected!
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|I'll start with my prior experience with Les Mis: I have watched the Liam Neeson film version twice.  I have never read the book or seen any other version performed.<br /><br />I had heard this was a musical.  I assumed that \\"musical\\" meant some dialogue, and then breaking into song, followed by more dialogue, like we see in Disney movies, the Sound of Music, or Moulin Rouge.  Since I really enjoy those types of movies, and since I know Hugh Jackman is a consummate performer on stage, I rented this movie on New Release VOD in HD.<br /><br />Within the first 5 minutes, I knew I was going to have to abandon my hope of spoken dialogue.  And not only abandon hope for it, attempt to like the movie without it.  I really wanted to like it.  But I just couldn't get over the clunky, unfocused, at times cacophonous crap that would have been awesome as well acted and spoken majority of the movie.<br /><br />Most of the actors here are phenomenal, and the facial expressions and \\"cohesive songs\\" - songs that are really songs and not just a jumble of notes that should have been spoken word - are wonderful (with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen, neither of whom I can stand - in anything).<br /><br />Stand outs:<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's brief appearance and incredible song should be Oscar nominated at the least.  However, if I hadn't seen the Liam Neeson film, I would have had a harder time caring for her, since she is here and gone before we knew what happened.  Her emotional performance was simply outstanding.  And I didn't know she could sing.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman.  I was terribly disappointed.  If he could have acted his way through the spoken material, this would have been an Oscar for sure.  But the score is just so...well I've already used the words disjointed, cacophonous, clunky, horrible.  Unmelodic.  Distracting. It seems like Hugh can't find the notes.  We can't, either.  But his facial expressions and body movement, and his performance on the \\"real songs\\" is wonderful.<br /><br />Russell Crowe.  I enjoyed his singing dialogue best.  And that's saying something.  His acting was...like all Russell Crowe acting.  Compared to Geoffrey Rush's Javert, well, lets just say I wonder if Geoffrey can sing.  Then again, even if he can't, he would have been better than:<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried.  Dear God.  Do not let this woman sing again.  In anything.  Including the shower.  I winced less getting my ingrown toenail corrected with no anesthesia.  From her first song, I spent the rest of the movie praying she wouldn't sing again.  Those fervent prayers were not, alas, answered.<br /><br />Borat and Bellatrix:  Why the #*&^ did they get such a HUGE part in this movie, yet Anne Hathaway got so little?  Their characters should have been one SHORT song at best, but they drone on and on and on.  We get it, they mistreat Cosette.  But we don't see them constantly defrauding Fantine of her money, since she's already dead by the time their huge, elaborate and far too long dance sequence bores us for 10 minutes.  Absolutely detested their characters, the time spent on them, and the actors themselves.  Yakk!<br /><br />Two stars, one each for Anne and Hugh.<br /><br />- 1 star for sung dialogue.<br />- 1 for letting that harpy screech at me for far too long.  Seriously.  I nearly walked out.  Except it was VOD at my house.<br />- 1 for letting Borat and Bellatrix onto the movie set, let along sing in it.  How this woman could even be considered in the top 10 British Actresses (alongside Helen Mirren, Dame Judy Dench, Julie Andrews and Maggie Smith) is far beyond my comprehension.<br /><br />Summary:  SKIP THIS ONE IF:<br />- You don't enjoy every woooord drawwwwn oooooout of the script in-harmoniously.<br />- You don't like Borat or Bellatrix<br />- You don't have a pair of earplugs for every time Amanda Seyfried opens her mouth.<br />- You thought the end of the Liam Neeson film made sense, because this doesn't.  Andit's different.  Granted, I was still dazed by the harpy, but still...didn't make any sense to me.  And I'm reasonably intelligent.  Maybe it was too long.  Should have cut that dang Thenardier scene.  Like, out.  Altogether.it's different.  Granted, I was still dazed by the harpy, but still...didn't make any sense to me.  And I'm reasonably intelligent.  Maybe it was too long.  Should have cut that dang Thenardier scene.  Like, out.  Altogether.
B009DJB8I2|4.0|A lot of the songs felt a bit like &#34;filler.&#34; Also the 4 disc jewel case didn't fare very well in transit. Aside from that there was a lot of music I enjoyed.
B00138KGOS|4.0|I shied away from buying this for years because of the potpourri of styles and tracks....and bad reviews.  I understand the frustration of Dylan fans after the shock of Nashville Skyline and its length of 28 minutes, but I think Dylan knew exactly what he was doing!  Of course, after all these years of reinventions, I think this was where he was at in '69-70.  If you deconstruct the album into it's similar parts, the songs written by Dylan are marvelous, even though the first track doesn't even feature Dylan's vocal at all.  He brings up some songs meant for NS, but for some reason, not included.  The other thing that needs to be pointed out is the experimentation-strings for cryin' out loud!  Notice the Everly brothers covers he tackles and makes his own.  Then there's the live material backed by the Band, which he'd go on to work with one year later on Planet Waves.  And to the standards, Dylan adds his own unique touch-note the fine guitar playing interspersed with his voice.  His voice that had gone from the nasal singing/talking to the country drawl....he almost sounds like he's trying to croon on songs like Blue Moon.<br /><br />Record Store Day with the single of an outtake of Wigwam, backed with a SP outtake from the forthcoming Bootleg Series Vol 10, it may shed a little bit more light on this period in Dylan's career.  A box of tapes from these sessions were discovered as having mysteriously disappeared from the Nashville studios when they started compiling the Bootleg series.  They were found in a barn on a piece of land that some guy had recently purchased.  He offered a price that Columbia/Sony was unwilling to pay.  But a few months back, they were placed on ebay and sold for something like 30 grand.  These may be them.  Or that could be just another made up story.<br /><br />Anyway, prepare yourself for what is to come by giving this another try.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews on Goodreads, but man am I glad I picked this one up. While the summary does sound a lot like Matched, Lauren Oliver does such a better job of creating a detailed futuristic society built upon an intricately weaved web of lies. I loved learning about this new society where love is viewed as a disease that people need to have brain surgery to be cured of it. Lauren Oliver's writing is also SO beautiful. It sometimes felt like reading poetry with the imagery and figurative language.<br /><br />I loved Lena's character. While some reviews talked about hating that she was a girl who solely built her confidence when a boy found her, I saw things quite differently. Lena has lead a completely different life than what we are used to and you can see shimmers of her bravery, strength of will, and determination when she interacts with Hana. The main problem is that she has been brainwashed just like everyone else living in this new society. As she slowly learns the truth and the web of lies starts unraveling (and yes, many of these are due to Alex, but she starts before with Hana). I can understand her fascination and strong feelings for Alex when here this poor girl has never even been exposed to boys. This is a classic young romance that reminded me of my first love in high school (when yes I too did think the world would end when things didn't work out). That first love is a strong and powerful, sometimes all encompassing thing.<br /><br />What I loved the most was seeing how deep the lies ran within the society. I loved the propaganda pieces that would start each chapter and the hints of while the government was trying to get rid of love and consequently hate, there are still those who enjoy violence or even worse are indifferent and no longer feel anything towards others. If I taught high school, the conversations we could have with this book! I can't wait to see where Lena's journey takes her in the next installment.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I Like the fact that you can play this game without depending on others like so many other similar games where you need friends to progress in game.  I wish the tasks where more frequent. Overall I Like this game
B000O8OTNC|4.0|i like that it is easy to use and comes with instructions on how to use on the back.  what i didnt like is that it does not work with big knives only small i mean you can sharpen big knives but it leaves small sharp edge

B001L83PLQ|4.0|This book was great - I only sometimes was confused with all the narration and jumping in time  otherwise it was a read worthy novel that truly describe the tragic  result of war
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino does it again with his latest and greatest. If you like buddy cop comedies, westerns, and action adventures this is the movie for you. A must own. I love every part. It is genuinely funny, and the action is top notch. The German legend of Siegfried is reborn as Django must save his beloved Broom Hilda from the Dragon of slavery in 1858 Mississippi. Samuel L Jackson is incredible and Leo DiCaprio is amazing. Christoph Waltz is truly deserving of the Oscar and Quentin has a wonderful cameo.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Excellent story.  The characters are genuine.  For those interested in Irish history and in particular the Catholic church's part in its history, this is a must read.  Your heart will ache for those children and your heart will sing when they are finally redeemed.  My first book by Ms McKenna but will look for more.
0786956291|4.0|It's enough to get going with D&D however it doesn't do a great job explaining the whys on everything.  If you want to know in depth how to create a character or DM a game you'll need to pick some of the books.  Keep the map and character sheets around, run the campaign with your friends and then move one to some other pre-made campaigns.  Very nice box with a classic look, comes with enough to get you going, I'd say well worth what I paid.

B000GCFO08|4.0|Excellent movie! It came sooner than expected, and was in great condition, there were no scratches and the movie itself was amazing
B003ZYU3T6|5.0|I would imagine that if you're here, you already know what an excellent film Modern Times is, and don't need to be convinced of its greatness. Chaplin achieves that rare mix of brutal satire and sweet, affectionate filmmaking that helps this film maintain its relevance almost eighty years later. More than any of his other movies, Modern Times represents for me the broadest swath of Chaplin's genius, having written, directed, produced, starred in, and composed the score for it. And if you can sit through this movie without falling in love with Paulette Goddard, see a doctor. You may be dead.<br /><br />The transfer is close to flawless. There's some artificial (I'm assuming it's digitally added; it looks odd) grain near the beginning that sticks out like a sore, grainy thumb. But either it only lasts that one scene or I quickly acclimated to it - though I suspect the former, as I still haven't noticed it on repeat viewings. There doesn't appear to be this astonishing restoration as there is for many classic Criterion titles, because the film seems to have survived in excellent shape - when TCM airs it, their version is nearly this good. But if you're looking to purchase a copy of this film, as always, you'll do well to purchase the Criterion version.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|The plot is interesting and evolves around corners and under the earth.  The characters are drawn pretty well and the legal system is portrayed somewhat cynically.  The ending is somewhat of a surprise and inconclusive.  All-in-all, kept me reading and intrigued.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Very clever characterisations which keep you guessing on the 'who dunnit' all the way through. Lots of twists and turns that are unexpected and very clever plot that isn't so complicated you lose the plot. Would highly recommend
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I think this movie should was the Oscar winner for best movie. In musicals like this, the quality of the performace of the cast singing about their tragedies is more emotional than the regular performance, specially when you can see any details of their feelings on a IMAX big screen.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really liked this book. Mark Watney is really funny guy, his remarks were great, I loved every one with duct tape. And about NASA. And about... well, everything. Really well written and now I'm kind of sad that it ended. But also happy, because, of course, they saved him :) It's a spoiler, but I guess you will be expecting it. But I was wondering the whole book how it will happen, what will go wrong in the process... And the book gave me more than I expected. Great!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Fantasy but this movie has  a very good lesson: sometimes the pesimistic people prefer believe in an ugly daily truth than a good fantasy story that keeps the ideal of life.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I personally think this is great for all ages and I hope you find this helpful because after all I am a critic
1451695195|5.0|Hi, Well, you can disparage the writer all you want calling his ideas hooey but to be honest, these folks totally misread the title and the content of the book.  What he calls heaven is actually a state of consciousness, an alternative state of consciousness.  It's a timeless, spaceless level of awareness that opens up one's intuition and higher levels of perception.  It's a liberated state.  To those who have any practice in meditation, it's easy to recognize and it's written about in various Eastern philosophies and traditions: nirvana, samadhi, Tao from Buddhism, Tantra and Taoism respectively.  Though there may be aspects of his experience which are flavored by his personality, and this might be some of what is a turn off for the secular and skeptical, what he communicates is about the essence of an ecstatic reality  - one that both reveals the underlaying unity of all creation and the personal relationship with the essence which is intrinsic and accessible to every single human being.

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Nice voyeuristic look into the life of Alfred Hitchcock during the peak of his career.  This was based on one particular book, so it's hard to gauge how accurate the information might be.  Nevertheless, it is a good film - if not great - on the life of the &#34;Master of Suspense&#34;.

From its &#34;grand&#34; performances to its opulent sets, &#34;Grand Hotel&#34; is one film you don't want to miss.  If anything, please check out a radiant Joan Crawford as an ambitious stenographer and John Barrymore as a man down-on-his luck.

B00BDSRER0|5.0|I love Phoenix.  I was so excited to hear a new album was coming out.  I've had it preordered for what feels like forever.  They didn't disappoint me.  They are such a unique band.  I loved most of the CD.  Of course Entertainment has the great Phoenix sound.  Trying to Be Cool is another great one...Drakkar Noir, Bourgeois and Chloroform, The Real Thing and Don't.  The CD is great, if you are a Phoenix fan you are going to want to own this one.  It does slow in a few spots, but again, isn't that just part of the Phoenix style.  Buy this, you won't be disappointed.

0393316041|5.0|\\"Surely you're joking, Mr Feynman\\" has been on my reading list for a long time, but I never got myself to actually read it. Now I did and I'm glad I did because I found it one of the most funny and insightful books that I've read recently. It's a biography but consisting of short stories of interesting events that happened in the life of Nobel Prize Winner Richard Feynman who seemed to have a special talent of getting himself into interesting situations.<br /><br />The book consist of 5 parts, which are roughly equal to five important periods in Feynman's life. These are: 1) His early pre-university life, 2) His university life, 3) Involvement in the Manhattan project, 4) Early years as a professor, and 5) Later years as a physicist and professor. Each of these parts consist of small chapters that tell a situation (usually funny or weird) in which he got himself and his usually odd reactions in that situation.<br /><br />Throughout the book, there is this honest, smart, jokingly view on life. Feynman did experiments. Not just experiments in physics but experiments in life. He would try out things to see if he could do it or to see how people would react. That attitude of experimenting and learning always got him in weird situations and this book is full of those. Example? As a boy trying to imitate Italian (and getting away with it). Removing doors from classmates and so honestly admitting that he did it that nobody believed him (hilarious!). Pick-locking safes. Playing Brazilian instruments. Doing out to Vegas to hand out with gamblers and show women. Proof reading secondary school science books and actually reading them :)<br /><br />This was one of these books which I found myself laughing out loud quite often. Many of the stories made such an impression that I went off to tell other people about it as they stuck with me (especially the genius experiment with water, a glass and a tip). Everytime when I read more of it, I got more excited about the book and I was actually very sad when I finished the book. It is a book I'll probably re-read (and enjoy as much the second time). It isn't a book about physics or about a specific topic, it is purely a book about Richard Feynman... a curious character... indeed. Five stars, recommended for people who want to read an interesting and fun book.actually very sad when I finished the book. It is a book I'll probably re-read (and enjoy as much the second time).

B008602KQI|1.0|This is what happens when a terrific book is hijacked for the sole purpose of turning a quick profit. Thankfully, I didn't waste any money to go see this. Sure! lets put some lamo bland abercrombie actors along with some overused hollywood mainstays who could say their lines well enough but evoked every other stupid movie they've been in -heck! might as well have had John Goodman in there. Come to think of it, he might have been a small improvement to Woody Harrelson?? This movie could've been epic -I mean, we're talking about a deathmatch amongst kids! But this was more Glee than Gladiator. The production and the acting was on the level of a bad two-part mini series on network TV. And there's little evidence from watching this completely dry, stilted, and shallow interpretation that anyone with a major hand in creating this film was actually moved by the story.. Of course, the sequels will continue to pad plenty of pockets given the low standards of most movie-goers who have lauded this shallow project. Like some others in the know, I recommend Takami's film from 2001, Battle Royale over this Disney-channel crap.

I've had my share of deep south slavery movies and have been moved by what really happened in the 1800's and so on..but for QUENTIN T to come along and put a twist on a storyline of this nature and not be afraid to go through with it makes me a fan for life now. A must see for sure...i actually just got finished watching it again for 5th time..I like to commend the writers and the film crew for all their hard work andtalent. ..Jaime F was amazing as always...Leonardo was captivating and Samuel was hilarious as usual.

B009PHQ9OA|5.0|I love this album. First heard Bastille off of a Youtube suggestion and was instantly hooked. They are now one of my top 3 favorite bands. I pre ordered the album (I cant buy this in stores in the US) knowing it would be more popular than they (the band) thought it would be. I was right, my ordered was delayed by two weeks because amazon had trouble even obtaining the item after its release. Finally, it came and I found utter joy among its  songs. If you want a short taste of the album I would suggest listening to Pompeii, Oblivion, and Things We Lost to the Fire entirely. Everyone I have introduced to Bastille weren't as easily taken as I was at FIRST but VERY quickly they grew to truly enjoy their music, and couldn't get enough.

B000JMKQX0|2.0|As a historian, I enjoyed the oral history concept of the book. The individual stories were riveting and painted an excellent portrait how different people of different cultures might react to something like this. That said, I found several things about the book disappointing - namely the lack of explanations. I will readily admit that I am not a fan of the zombie genre, mostly because the concept is bizarre. Some scholars speculate that zombie lore peaks in popularity during periods of recession and turmoil. Perhaps it does, but whether it is our modern society's Dance Macabre or just a morbid fascination, it perplexes me that no one seems to bother with coming up with a medical scenario for how zombism can happen. This is after all fiction. It would not be hard to hash out how this virus affects the body, how the body functions and decays at the same time. This book does mention that the dead lack the bacteria to break down food. Why then do they need to feed? These are the answers this book fails to answer. How long do they continue to exist? Why can they be frozen, thaw, and start shuffling again? Why do they continue to exist in the oceans. The book alludes to the fact that the mysteries of the virus were uncovered in time but cops out by saying the information wad not made available to the common man. This lack of information drastically reduces the driving impact the book could have had. Pity too to have to label it as mere horror fodder. It started with far more promise to end so weak.

1452115567|5.0|I have been a big fan of Maddie's (as well as a fan of her owner Theron Humphrey) for quite some time. I purchased \\"Maddie on Things\\" as a sort of \\"coffee table book\\" in my house. So many people pick it up to browse and then find themselves going through each individual picture of Maddie. I love the book and everyone who I have shared it with seems to love it too. I would highly recommend to to any dog lover/photographer. Also, being a huge supporter of animal rescue, Maddie is a perfect example of how wonderful rescue dogs are. Beautiful imagery and a talented dog who clearly loves to please her owner and rescuer!

There are lots of pop coulter references that anyone who grew up in the 80s would probably really enjoy.  I thought this was entertaining and brings out your inner nerd.  Bottom line--this is a good book and I would recommend it!

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This movie was everything I wanted plus the fact it was a Blu-ray version for my granddaughter.  The seller stated exactly what the product was and upon receipt was not disappointed.  Finally, I received the movie even sooner than imagined.  Overall experience was great.
B00BDSRISA|4.0|For what its worth, it would be tough for anyone to meet or exceed the expectations set for Phoenix.  The band is coming off of its wonderful 2009 release, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.  The album was a critical and commercial success -- it was popular on a mass scale with the hit singles \\"Lisztomania\\" and \\"1901\\", and it scored well with indie hipsters.  The album was indie-rock at its core, but it was polished and waxed with a nice French New Wave coating.  The marriage of this melodic songwriting and stylish electronic music made for a record that was unmistakably cool.  Because Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix is so well regarded, the music community has been chomping at the bit for their followup.  Four years later, and here it is: 2013's Bankrupt!<br /><br />Phoenix's formula is largely unchanged from its last album -- the band writes alternative/indie songs and coats them in stylish electronic percussion and synth.  Bankrupt! differs in a few ways from Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix though.  This record is a bit more experimental with its sounds, and the band takes its time developing grooves this time around.  Where Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix was largely to-the-point and concise, Bankrupt! allows itself to briefly.  Make no mistake, these songs are all crafted as pop songs, but their sound is more multidimensional on this record.  The band, when promoting the album, warned that it would be \\"experimental.\\"  For the most part though, this music is unmistakably Phoenix.<br /><br />The album begins with its lead single, \\"Entertainment.\\"  The song centers around an Eastern-themed motif played out on the synthesizer, and while the song itself is quite good, this motif really annoys me.  I'm not sure if this will be a problem for other listeners (you can sample the track on the internet), but it stands out from the rest of the song like a sore thumb.  It just doesn't seem to belong.  The second track \\"The Real Thing\\" may be my favorite for the album.  The song builds itself around distorted bass and a percussive track similar to Prince's \\"When Doves Cry.\\"  \\"S.O.S. in Bel Air\\" features a nice tempo change between the verse and chorus -- everything slows to a crawl for the chorus before jumping back up to speed directly after.  The title track, \\"Bankrupt!\\" is largely an instrumental track that finds the band's sound awash in synthesizers.  The last few minutes of this track change though, with vocals coming in and a change of tempo and timbre.  \\"Don't\\" provides another really nice track with its percussive synthesizers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some of the tracks on Bankrupt! really fail to make any impression at all.  \\"Drakkar Noir\\" for example is a fine effort, but the music, the lyrics, the melody, nothing seems to really be interesting here.  The final track, \\"Oblique City\\" has plenty of things going on in it, but it closes the album in a middling way.  I can't help but compare this with Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix's \\"Armistice\\" which served as one of the album's highlights.  Because Bankrupt! ends on such an unimpressive note, the album doesn't beg to be replayed.<br /><br />The problem is Bankrupt! is its expectations -- because Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix set the bar so high, it seems like it would be impossible to replicate such a success.  And if you go into this record with high hopes, you might come away from it disappointed.  However, if you have no expectations, you'll likely see Bankrupt! for what it is: a perfectly fine alternative album.  There are not standout gems like \\"Lisztomania\\" or \\"1901\\" here, but many of these songs will stay with you after they've played out.  If you were not impressed by Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, this album probably won't make you fall in love with the band.  If, however, you enjoyed their previous work, Bankrupt! is a good album that's worth a listen.<br /><br />Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"Entertainment,\\" \\"The Real Thing,\\" and \\"Don't\\".<br /><br />ADDITIONAL RELEASE INFO: Bankrupt! also comes in a Deluxe version.  The deluxe version doesn't add much to the normal version of the album.  The only real difference is the addition of the 60+ minute studio outtakes track.  The track features plenty of interesting sketches -- some that become songs on the album, and some that don't.  Unfortunately, these are all just sketches, and they don't last but a minute or so in length.  We're given plenty of ideas of what music they were working on, but not enough time to really let these grooves and tunes sink in before we are rushed along to the next idea.uxe version.

067144901X|5.0|It seems like these days, everyone is asking people to bring a gift AND a book to baby showers (you think I'm made of money!).

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I installed this on my Android tablet in order to download books available on Amazon. So far, it has twice posted an error saying (something to the effect) that the titles I downloaded were not properly registered and to delete and download them again. They read properly after each new download, but I can't say it won't happen again. Just hope it isn't right after I've boarded a plane.<br />The satisfaction of immediately reading a purchase (after download - I don't do clouds), having a library (which can contain groups) in such a small package, and the typical cost savings between the electronic and the tree editions of a publication are definite pros. Also, the dictionary works well, and I like that books reopen where I left off.<br />On the other hand, I have failed to determine where the downloads are being saved. I want to force them to my external SD card since my internal memory is limited and many applications won't run from anywhere else. I can't find any setting for selecting the download destination, and haven't been able to find the actual files, yet, to see where they've been saved. Even if they are going where I'd like, I consider the inability to specify a location an irritating omission.<br /><br />I would still recommend this product, particularly since it's 1) free, 2) easy to use, and 3) removable.
B008OHV5QO|3.0|Been a fan of Neil's since 1967 so I can always find something to like in his work. But Jonathan Demme seems to have dropped the ball in many ways with this thing. Oddly, he felt the need to dress up Neil's performance of Ohio with old footage from the campus shooting, as if the intended audience of the movie had been in a coma since 1965 and never heard of this! Meanwhile, Let's Roll, the song he wrote in a similar fit of outrage right after 9/11 has lost its relevance for Old Neil. Somehow, the 4 in Ohio outrank the 4000 in NY, DC and Pennsylvania. But I'm always able to forgive Neil his eccentricities. His performance here has got a wistful, elegiac quality. I think the aneurysm really woke Neil up to his own mortality. Here, its like he's saying farewell to his fans. It has a very intimate quality, just like his recent book, [[ASIN:0399159460 Waging Heavy Peace]]. I guess I'd be kind of disappointed if Neil were ever to renounce his hippie ethos. No danger of that happening here.

1250012570|5.0|So, Wow. I have read a lot of teenage romances and this one kind of breaks all of the stereotypes that usually turn me off. First, Eleanor isn't a traditional \\"pretty.\\" She self identifies as being rather chubby. She has huge unwieldy curly red hair. She doesn't wear make-up and doesn't even have decent clothes to wear to school, so she covers the holes in her jeans with bandanas and silk and flowers strategically safety-pinned.<br /><br />It isn't love at first sight. But Eleanor and Park form a sort of silent bond through comic books and music until it blossoms until something more. The book is peppered with phrases like \\"I want to eat his face!\\" Park keeps saying \\"I love you,\\" but Eleanor can't bring herself to say it because she has a REALLY horrible home life and doesn't want to be that close to anyone. So they decide that she is the Han Solo of the relationship (Leia: \\"I love You,\\" Han: \\"I Know\\"), but Park doesn't want to be Leia so they decide that he is Boba Fett and will follow her anywhere in the galaxy. A[...]<br /><br />There are a lot of really touching but also horrifying scenes, like the one where Park's beautician mother decides to bond with Eleanor by giving her a make-over. Eleanor doesn't really want anything to do with that, but afterwards Park starts wearing eyeliner to school. And that leads to (SPOILER) more face-eating scenes.<br /><br />In the end, Eleanor's home life degrades to the point that it is obvious her stepfather is either going to rape or kill her. Park finds a way to rescue Eleanor, but it looks like it will mean losing her in the process. *Cue sad punk music.* But fear not, since this is still in essence a sappy teen romance novel, you can be ready for a sappy romance ending. I LOVED IT!

8866130885|5.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan, so I love this planner.  It is small enough to fit in my smaller purses, and has the week on one side and lines on the other.  I've used these planners in the past, so I know they fit my needs.  It is very well made, as are all Moleskine notebooks.  I don't have many appointments so I just write whatever appointments I have in the week side, and use the lined side as my to do list for the week.  Even though it's small, is has room enough to enter quite a bit of information.  I don't use the address book because I have my cell phone for that (I also use a calendar on my cell phone, but I find I need to actually write things out to help me remember them).  The pocket in the back is good to put in business cards or small papers handy.  Love it!

B007MU85D0|2.0|I bought this album on a whim from Amazon's recommendation - they've given me both phenomenal suggestions (The Dodos, Ruby Suns, bands that might have otherwise fallen off my radar), and drab old hats that were off the radar for a good reason. Little did I know that this was the band responsible for the joyous airwave sensation, Little Talks; as soon as I heard the first downbeat of the first song I recognized the voices and the sound.<br />Little Talks is a fun song, definitely of higher quality than the majority of pop music these days, but it's quality unfortunately is mostly derived from other sources, specifically the Arcade Fire, broken social scene, animal collective - of course Edward Sharpe being the pioneer of the \\"HA!\\" Punctuated chorus, so far as I can tell.<br />Which drawing on sources isn't bad in itself, except that Of Monsters adds nothing new to the story, the album's single earworm merely feeds off other, better songs, and the rest just seem to wallow about in uninspired doldrums, just leading up to, and letting you down from, Little Talks. The songs are hardly distinguishable, beginning with a hook and hushed duet, then raising up the trumpets in the middle with the same fist pounding chorus, anthem after anthem.<br />Now I love Arcade Fire. I tolerate Edward Sharpe. But this album comes too late for me. Maybe I'll return to it when my Funeral album has melted from overplay.

B003ZMF26W|2.0|Let me say first off that I have just unboxed this mouse. The review is based off of very little experience with this mouse.<br /><br />I am kind of upset with my purchase. I bought this mouse with the thought that it was going to be a wireless mouse. I understand that there is nothing in the advertisement of this mouse that says it is wireless or wired, but the pictures are completely deceiving. There is a 5 mouse comparison on the bottom of the item description page that has 5 pictures of mice. Each mouse, in every single one of these pictures, has a cord coming out of the front of it, but the CM Storm Inferno is lacking this (in my opinion) very crucial view of the mouse. All of the pictures of the mouse as well, are all deceiving. In none of the pictures can you see the cord. The pictures have even been doctored to seem as though there is no cord attached to this mouse. I have not determined whether this mouse is worth keeping or not, but THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THE ADVERTISING!<br /><br />Once they have contacted me, corrected the issue with the advertising, and once I am able to spend more than 20 minutes with this mouse I will write an update to this review.
0743297334|1.0|This book sucked!  I hated the characters. They were shallow, narcissistic drunks and whores.  And it had no plot.  It was basically a daily journal of some dude who likes to drink, fish, and go to bullfights.  I was planning on reading more Earnest Hemingway, but bumped him down on the list after this one.  I did end up reading A Farewell to Arms about a year later and it was much better.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I don't think I've ever left a review for a book, but I felt an exception was warrented for this series.  I read both 'The Name of the Wind' and 'A Wise Man's Fear' back in early 2011, and was utterly consumed by both books.  I woke early to get a bit of reading in; I read over lunch, each evening after work, all weekend long, until my eyelids refused to stay open every night.  I read with obsession.<br /><br />While I am an avid reader, this behavior is unusual for me...  Few books have seized my attention on that level, so it was difficult to set aside this story knowing that a couple years would pass before the next book was available.  Although, two years have gone by now, and since the next book in the series is scheduled for soon-ish (hopefully), I decided to re-read these books this past March (2013).  As a practical person, I wasn't looking forward to re-reading the books; it seemed like a waste of time to go back and do it all over again, knowing the story will be exactly the same story, for the sake of the next book.<br /><br />I re-read them both anyway...  And any doubt that I'd had in regards to reading the books for a second time quickly vanished as, I'm almost ashamed to say, the obsessive fascination returned with a vengeance.  It is downright silly how nut-balls I became in an effort to find more time to read these books.  If I was any kind of humanitarian I would probably give these books one star, and try to save all future readers from the beautiful addiction of this series.<br /><br />I know other reviewers have complained that the books were long-winded; I don't agree, even (especially) the second time around.  The story never lagged for me, it's well written, exciting, imaginative; it's one of those books they'll make a movie about, and the movie will never-ever-ever do the books justice.  My one and only (BIG, HUGE, legitimate) complaint is that this series, quite possibly, ruined all other books for me...  Well done, Mr. Rothfuss.
0385343248|5.0|The Dutch ship \\"Erasmus\\" is wrecked off the Japanese shores and its English captain, together with his crew, is taken prisoner by the Japanese, who also confiscate their ship and all their belongings. Here they will encounter the Jesuit Spanish and Portuguese priests who want to Christianize the whole country and the Japanese daimyo and samurai who are preparing for war.<br /><br />Blackthorne, the English captain and also the main character, will face death, humiliation, prison and betrayal countless times, but his intelligence and knowledge help him become one of daimyo Toranaga's most precious allies and, thanks to this, he gains access to more wealth and power than he could ever have known in Europe.<br /><br />The plot of the novel is full of twists and turns and written in short sentences that have great impact on the reader's mind, adding to the tempo and suspense of the story.<br /><br />It is very interesting to observe how both the Japanese and the Europeans perceive each other's cultural background, how they deeply hate each other's personality and customs at first and then how they progress to mutual respect. With genuine talent, James Clavell reveals the best and worst sides of the two opponents: on the one hand, the civilized Japanese have healthy everyday habits and a rigid code of honour, respect each other and their enemies' strategies and intelligence, but believe human feelings such as pity or love to be disgusting weaknesses and would have no second thoughts killing their whole families if their superiors wished it. On the other hand, the Europeans believe themselves the masters of the world and think that pity, rectitude and love are supreme values in life, but they would also commit the most heinous crimes in the name of their Christian god.<br /><br />Although there are many characters in the book - most of them are complex, with distinguishing features - I thoroughly enjoyed observing their development. My favourite character is Toranaga, theingenious and clever daimyo, a man of great military genius who cunningly deceives everybody else - while also sticking to his code of honour and rectitude - in order to achieve his selfish goals. I was fascinated with his ability to logically read other people's minds and to devise intricate ploys and manipulate them into thinking what he wanted them to.<br /><br />Yabu is another interesting character, the most humorous throughout the whole book in my opinion, a man of great ambition but little brains, who gets himself in an important position through the craftiness of his wife and nephew, Obi san, who always interpret the others' actions for him, suggesting what moves he should make, while he thinks that they are only going along with his own ideas.<br /><br />I also tremendously enjoyed reading about the importance of women in the feudal Japanese society. They are always dependent on their families, husbands or feudal lords, who have rights of life and death over them, but paradoxically, they are more independent than European women, being the ones who take care of the family money and household, who transact with usurers and who could influence their husbands' thoughts and decisions.<br /><br />Lady Mariko's personality, courage, erudition and strong sense of honour make her one of the most charismatic female characters I've read of lately, her illicit love affair with Blackthorne being all the more enthralling.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good adventure novel and to all those who would like to find out cultural facts about feudal Japan without having to wade through history texts. Don't be intimidated by its size: it reads so fast that you will be unable to put it down.
B00B52FDXQ|4.0|I love this TV series, the action and sex are great, but what really draws you in is the characters and the story, I just wish Andy Whitfield would have been able to finish the series but Liam came into his role for the last season.  Loved the last episode in the credits where they had Andy and Liam, both the Spartacus on the same screen and the last line is Andy yelling \\"I am Spartacus\\", made my eyes a little misty.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I have owned several plantronics headsets and really love the quality. This charger/case is excellent and well worth the money. Super convenient and always have the ability to recharge the headset when on the road. Also protects the headset well. This is a must buy if you own one of these headsets.<br />Note: I really like the magnetic charging...no small plug to insert anymore!!
B0072OFOM6|4.0|Addicting TV, miss Andy Whitfield as Spartacus, he was made for that role, but Liam McIntyre came in to a role and made it his own, the first couple episodes you wanted Andy but got used to Liam in the role.
1452101248|5.0|This is a fabulous book - vegetarian, but full of unusual, simple, fresh flavours.  Will be a favourite for some time to come.  I will buy another Ottolenghi book.  He is fabulous.

B006BXTOFC|4.0|I love this band. Every song is great on this album. Very affordable and easy to load onto my devices.
B00656C6KK|5.0|bought these for my younger sister and she loves them, I thought DD past away years ago, shows what I know.
6305971935|5.0|This is an awesome story and movie.  Wish they would make a Blu-Ray version.  It makes you wonder if they really did do something like this during WWII and it was a well kept secret.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I bought this strictly based on samples because 30 seconds of each song was enough to convince me I should have it.  Many listens later, I am so grateful I happened to stumble upon this because it is one of my favorite albums.  I highly recommend it.
0767836324|5.0|i grew up watching this film and i absolutely love it! i bought this for my boyfriend and he likes it too. the quality is great.

1452115567|5.0|Theron and Maddie made my day with this book. I enjoyed the pics via Facebook and Instagram, but now I have them on my coffee table too. What a great story. What a great man. What a great dog. Looking the pics, you hope, you wish you could be riding in the passenger seat with these two. Theron and Maddie are out there doing good things. I will buy this book for my friends. It's a fabulous gift idea. When you need a smile, open the book. Any page will make your day. Thank you for what you do. Thank you for your pictures and your outlook on life. Maddie is adorable. :)!!!!!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This BBC version of Emma is great with wonderful acting.  One of my favorite movies!  Plot has many interesting twists to it.
B00005NKKV|5.0|Sounds of Silence is still great after 40 years.  I bought a tape recorder around 1972 or 3. Sounds of Silence was one of the first cassettes that I bought.  I loved it then.  I love it now.
B0058YPILY|5.0|My family love to watch Criminal Minds and when nothing else is on television worth watch, we'll get out our DVD's and watch together.
B009AMALLM|4.0|I won't get nearly as wordy or detailed here as I normally might in one of my reviews, especially at this late date after so much as been said about this film already, but I just wanted to toss in my two cents and take a quick stab at defending it against all the negativity it has received. Be aware there may be one vague spoiler reference toward the end.<br /><br />I only watched Paranormal Activity 4 for the first time very recently, admittedly having put it off due in part to its poor reputation, but I was actually very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I certainly understand how people may have grown bored with the series, and it's true, the \\"edge of your seat\\" factor isn't quite as intense as it once was, but it definitely has the same general feel as the rest of the films and blends in alongside them seamlessly. I thought the young female lead was likeable, and the addition of the strange neighbor boy was interesting. To me, the parents almost seemed TOO aloof, almost to the point of caricature, but I suppose they were written that way intentionally to emphasize the importance of the children's roles. My one complaint, if I had to make one, was that things ended up pretty much the same way as they did in part 3, and nothing really happened to make the arcing storyline move forward in any significant way. A lingering question or two may have been answered, but seriously, it's time to either explore the whole witch thing in-depth or get off the pot, lol. In and of itself though, I found it very entertaining, with a fair share of suspenseful - if not exactly scary - moments, and would surely recommend it to those who may still on the line.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I play a lot of these games and this is one of the best by far. Game is a great length could have finished in a day but fun enough to play for several days. Love the advanced level, definitely gave me a true challenge to find active areas.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Has good features and works well. But it gets one star cuz no matter how good it is this app is completely useless cuz I can't save anything.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Excellent. We also used it for research: Gertrude Stein, Hemingway, Maxine's restaurant, Picasso, etc.<br />Plan on visiting that restaurant on trip to europe
1616614609|5.0|This is one of my favorite games currently, and I can see myself continuing to play it for a long time. The asymmetry of the corporation and runner let you mix it up and add a lot to the replayability. The starter decks work fine, but the ability to create your own decks makes the game great.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|MY SON (HE'S 13 AND THINKS THERE WILL BE A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE) AND I WATCH THIS SHOW EVERY WEEK NO MATTER WHAT. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS OUT THERE AND WE ALSO BUY THE DVD SETS WHEN THEY COME OUT AND WATCH THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN. I ALSO BOUGHT BOTH OF THE COMENDUM BOOKS FOR MY SON FOR CHRSITMAS AND HE LOVED THEM ALSO. I GIVE THIS SHOW A MILLION THUMBS UP!!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I received this within a few days. It's just what I was looking for. This is exactly as it was described.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great, fun game with cute characters that do not Greg old but continue to challenge the player in new ways with every level.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Fun and appropriate for young and old. The only thing is it could use some polishing but either that all good.
0307887448|5.0|One of the most unique books I've read lately! The plot is wonderful, as are the characters, but the world building is what truly makes this book stand out. The contrasting worlds of the utopian virtual reality and the ruined real world are both stunning and somehow feel like real places that could exist. A great vacation read!
B00BKBCF38|3.0|I was one of those who didn't really get into the first album until after several listens, then it continued to grow on me.  After seeing Ghost open for Mastodon, I continued to play it, and by the end of the year it was one of my favorites of the year (must of been Satan's influence).  So this one was highly anticipated.  And guess what, folks...it pretty much blows.  These guys better buy some Venom albums cause they're listening to too much ABBA.  It's softened up and wussed out here.  I mean, the new Stryper album is probably heavier.  A few tracks are OK but not enough to sustain interest.  Shame....they really had potential, but they're going in the wrong direction..hopefully they'll return to form on the next one.<br />UPDATE:  Just saw them last night at the Troc in Philly. The place was packed (probably with poseurs as why isn't it ever that packed for an Overkill gig?). The newer stuff came across stronger live, although again the first album stuff was stronger, and it was a good show, so i'll give an extra star.
B005C9YZPA|5.0|Great collector's edition! The globe case is attractive and the series is as beautiful as it ever was. A true classic.
1400069807|3.0|Michael Moss' book Salt, Sugar, and Fat will confirm all of your suspicions about the evils that go on behind the closed doors at processed food companies.  The book covers processed food's three main tenants, sugar, fat, and salt.  The author takes you behind the scenes by interviewing ex employees, scientists, and nutritionists.  You're told all of their secrets to getting you hooked on their foods.  It really is amazing the amount of research, work, and manpower these companies dedicate to creating the perfect processed food.  That perfect food is cheap and easy to produce, addictively delicious, and sells like hot cakes... notice I didn't say that the perfect food was also good for you.<br /><br />While it might sound like these companies are evil, fact of the matter is they are not completely devious.  Many of the products they create are truly meant to fill a need and make our lives better.  Many have also experimented with lessening the amount of sugar, fat, and salt in the foods, but the way the foods are designed to last during production and while sitting on the shelf, it's almost impossible to create a truly healthy version.  Not to mention the hounding the companies receive from Wall Street when sales are down, causing them to retreat to the tried and true methods.<br /><br />While the book was a fascinating read, its major downfall was that it was a bit long winded and could sometimes get very scientific and tedious.<br /><br />All in all... you'll be reading the nutrition fact on packages much more closely.
0062080237|5.0|I first read this book several years ago, and I still enjoy going back and re-reading it. The story is wonderfully complex, but its in the characters and character development where this book really shines. The (sometimes bizarre) alternating chapters/side stories that don't follow the plot can break the book's flow a bit and bog it down, but the ending is so well thought-out you won't care. Shadow remains one of my all-time favorite characters!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have nature relaxation recordings but have always wished I could change some of the sounds or music. With this app it's all you. Choose what you want and mix it up. I can't believe it's free.
0385523912|5.0|Eye-opening, elegantly structured, well-written account of life in North Korea. If you don't know much about this topic--as I didn't--you will be very disturbed.
B009G41CG2|4.0|For a free game this was entertaining.  I still play it quite often and would recommend it to other friends.
B00785P2QC|5.0|a very additive game. I would recommend to friends. its a good time killer on a commuter to the city
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was gripping from beginning to end. I stayed up  through the night into the morning hours to finish it.
B000001FMC|5.0|Swing Out Sister is one of my favorite groups.  I love the name Swing Out Sister!  It is jazzy-cool.  This is a great first album from SOS.  The cd has remixes of all their hits from It's Better To Travel. Fooled By A Smile is my all time favorite SOS song and it is track #6 on this album.  What a GREAT song!!!  I think this tune really shows off the pure beauty of Corinne Drewery's alto voice.  Corinne's singing voice should be patended as a fine musical instrament.  Break Out is the first Swing Out Sister song I ever heard.  I love the original video for Break Out.  The Remix of Surrender is another one of my faves from It's Better to Travel.  It is a haunting melody.  I absolutely, positively love the extended version of Twilight World on this cd.  I am a huge Swing Out Sister fan and to be perfectly honest, I like all the tunes on this superb album.  It's Better To Travel is a top rated cd as far as I am concerned.  If you are new to Swing Out Sister, this album is the best one to start your SOS collection with.  Swing Out Sister's musical genius is quite unique!  Give them a spin and you will never look at jazz the same way again.  Go ahead and Swing out with these ultra hip song-sters!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows out in my opinion. Has a crime part to it with a huge comical twist. Definitely a good show for everyone.
0765325950|5.0|For those who have followed the Wheel of Time saga there is no real need for a review but for those who may be considering it I can only say &#34;go ahead and jump in.&#34;  It has been a long journey.  I have been reading the books for 20 years and I'm sad to see it end.  It dragged a little in the middle but soon picked up to an exciting run to the end.  Robert Jordan died before ending the series but Brandon Sanderson has taken his notes and tapes and done a great job.  This last book is non-stop action and we get some POVs from characters we haven't had them from before.  A very exciting conclusion to one of the greatest fantasy stories.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|It was interesting and historic, just very long and seemed to drag on. Its just not my type of genre but if your into that historic type of stuff, this is perfect.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If you use eBay you really must have this app.  It lets you do everything you can do on the computer and even sends you reminders if an auction you are watching is ending soon or if you have been outbid.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Extremely easy to pick up, a great &quot;nerve pill&quot; (so to speak) because it draws you in so easily that you toss away anything that is bothering you! I recommend it wholeheartedly!
1452115567|5.0|I've been following Theron and Maddie for over a year on Instragram, and when i learned they were turning their best photos and putting them into a book, it was a no brainer!<br />The book is great.  150+ pages of photos of Maddie.  Perfect for any dog lover's coffee table, waiting room, heck bathroom reading material!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|\\"Oblivion\\" is a true science fiction story. I say that because a true science fiction story has technology, gadgets and a futuristic view of the world. Of course in \\"Oblivion\\" the future of earth is destined for nuclear catastrophe and that theme has been done so many times in movies, it must be true. There are new kinds of drones that are not small planes that drop bombs on targets, but large \\"Robocop\\" like circular machines with turrets and a programmed mind that annihilates most anything that moves. Finally, we have a spectacularly cool plane that twists and turns and truly must be seen to explain.<br /><br />The biggest thing standing in the way of \\"Oblivion\\", in my opinion, is an advertisement that claims that it is the best film of the year. Well, it is only April and the summer blockbuster season and the end of the year Oscar season haven't even arrived yet, but that's a pretty bold statement. So, is it?<br /><br />I want to say that \\"Oblivion\\" is one of the most creative science fiction movies I've seen in years, but I'm going to hold off on that because truly, its creativity is a collage of many science fiction movies that came before it. I'm not going to list those movies because I don't want to give anything away, but there are probably six. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a mechanic assigned to a wife who work as a team patrolling an area that wasn't affected by nuclear fallout and repairing downed drones. Harper and all other known survivors have had their memories cleared; yet he continues to have dreams of his past life.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" has a moody pace to it, occasionally it is eventful and consuming and occasionally it is slow and dramatic. Unlike many movies these days that spend zero time at all building up character and just want to dazzle you with all the really nifty effects they've discovered, \\"Oblivion\\" does the opposite; it puts character first and then sucks you in with the effects. Maybe a happy medium would have worked better, but I'm not going to complain because I'm tired of movies that make you feel nothing but, \\"Wow! That looked cool.\\" Thankfully, somebody in Hollywood realizes that you need to put heart first when telling a story. If you're tired of emotion-free action/science fiction movies as well, you'll probably love \\"Oblivion\\".<br /><br />I have a hard time believing by the end of 2013 that \\"Oblivion\\" will be the best movie of the year. The elements that make up the story are way too recycled to have too much of an impact down the road. Although for now, the realizations of the technology and the heart that it delivers make it the best movie I've seen so far this year. Thankfully, great actors like Morgan Freeman, Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko and an emotional performance by Andrea Risenborough turned a stale story into something memorable and good.not going to complain because I'm tired of movies that make you feel nothing but, \\"Wow!

B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I don't know whether the movie is any good because we couldn't see it for all the ghosts in the picture.  It was terrible.  My first experience with streaming video and it was lousy.  I might try again but this money thrown away.
0316228532|3.0|I was rather disappointed. I thought it was slow in getting off the ground and there was far too much<br />narrative.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|No holes in packaging.  I dont normally buy DVD's anymore but after I saw this in the theatre, I knew I would want to own it even it goes in the future cloud.

B008YP272M|4.0|A gripping step by step account of the downward health spiral caused by an aggressive terminal malignancy. Each new health issue is compounded by kibitzer comments from friends and health workers and execrable remarks from religious fanatics. Hitchens feels death is cheating him of unfulfilled ambitions, but he accepts and describes the inevitable with masterful prose and dignity.
1451695195|5.0|I command DR. Alexander for his brave decision to come forward with his experience, and his decision to go fare-ward with further research in that field. It is about time! Keeping our eyes closed in-front the truth will not make the truth go away, will it? We are Spiritual Beings having Human experience. Time is NOW that we finally Integrate our Sovereignty with the matter, and therefore, we are acknowledging that we are actually a Sovereign Integral here and now.

B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Fantastic movie thought it was as good as Argo amazing that it was based on true story. Thanks to the young officer
0812993845|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella. I have loved 99% of all of her books (The Shopaholic's started getting too repetitive but everything else I loved). 'Wedding Night' is another hit for this talented author. It had me laughing and commiserating with the two main characters and I couldn't wait to finish reading this book. That is when you know you have a good book. When you want to devour it in hours but you also want to make it last forever. Lottie was hilarious and almost too much but that is why I loved her and her older sister Fliss was also great. Loved this book!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|This product is without a doubt a fantastic choice to anyone with this amount of money. This product is very nice to the price, so long as you like over ear headphones. The build quality is pretty good. It is plastic, but it isn't cheap plastic, it is hard plastic so it it quite durable. There is leather cushioning on for the top of your head and around the ears. I have owned this headset for about a month now and what I have noticed in terms of audio quality is that it handles everything very well and the surround sound support with Dolby 7.1 audio is very nice. My only small problem is the bass. It is pretty strong and it makes the surround sound very complete, but for those of us &#34;bass heads&#34; that love a very strong bass, then you might notice that, but for all of this headset's other features, I think that the bass can be overlooks with ease. Next, this headset is VERY comfortable for long periods. It may become uncomfortable after 4 hours of use for the first few days, but it expands after a few days of use a little bit so the pressure is reduced a little bit. That little bit of pressure that it loses is definitely a 'pro' though; it becomes very comfortable. Also, the volume wheel on the side is very nice with the mute button right next to it. There are also three programmable macro keys on the side that you can set to open a program, turn the bass up or down, or many other things. The battery life is also pretty good. At full charge, the drivers will tell you that it has 10 hours of battery left, but I noticed that it has a battery life closer to 8 hours, but that is completely fine to me. The charging cable is long enough and thin enough for you to charge your headset during use and you would feel as if you are using a wired headset; not a wireless headset being charged, so that is nice. Finally, the drivers must be mentioned. I adore the drivers. They are very useful and offer adjustment to volume, microphone volume, sidetone volume, treble, bass, and you can configure the power of each speaker's volume for the surround sound. Overall, this is a stellar headset and the price is just right. Of course these don't compare to a headset like the Astro 50's, but they are still an extraordinary price for such a product. I recommend this to anyone.
B005UKI1EW|5.0|amazing concert,bocelli was his amazing self,perfect choice of music,new york philmonic was great,loved to watch conductor very ,the guests artists were all perfect,just an amazing concert esp. if you have great equipment to play the disc.i could watch it every day and not get sick of it.andrea bocelli is just amazing,his voice is just perfect for every song on the concert.highly recommend this blu-ray
B00B4804KS|5.0|At the time this movie originally came out, I was only six and had no appreciation for the cinematic powerhouse I was witnessing. When I saw that the movie was getting a limited run for the 20th anniversary, I knew that, even though it was in 3D, I had to be there.<br /><br />Wow...20 years has not aged this movie one bit. The CGI and special effects may not be up to par with modern day blockbusters, but they still hold up very well. The film is one of Spielberg's best and is a masterpiece of suspense. Tonally, it works on every level and the pacing of the film couldn't be better. It's one of the last movies I remember seeing that makes great use of animatronics instead of heavily relying on CGI. I'm not a huge fan of 3D but I have to say the conversion to the format wasn't bad. In my opinion, Jurassic Park belongs on the list of greatest movies of all time, and will continue to stand the test of time for years to come.
B005USZYDU|5.0|A dramatic story about a murder with action and fright<br />and I highly recommend it.<br />Loved it now go and read it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I played the free download earlier &amp; am going to pay the $2.99 to unlock the full version now... it's that nice! I love HO games  with quickly refilling hint buttons like this. Can't wait to play it through.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|If you don't know what the story is about, No Worries! This is how movies should be made. The cover isn't as good as Part 1, that's the Only downside. Still Part 1 is better. Ha! Makes you hope they make The Dark Knight Strikes Again into an animated movie. Its always felt as though it wasn't meant to be a comic, but if it was animated it would fit right in. Damn!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I was reluctant to see this movie after so many viewings of the Jason Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon. Fortunately, the story line, the fine performances of the actors, and the duplicity of the plot were more than worthy of Robert Ludlum.
B009KPAN5I|5.0|The only special features are 2 bonus episodes from the old series and a boring documentary. The film itself is the best to date. Enjoy the film you've know will surpass expectations. I'm 200% sure no other DC film will ever compare(even The FlashPoint Paradox), even Part 2 Can't compare.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|After seeing this movie once, I knew that I had to own it. It is a great ensemble piece - rather like Moonstruck. All of the actors are believable, even the young kids! The magic and passion of true dancing come alive in this movie!
0988262592|4.0|I liked the book for sure, any chance I had, I read it. This was my first novel about IT. Being used to reading technical books which usually require lots of thinking and re-reading, The Phoenix Project was easy to read and way more fun, rarely boring. I hope it had outlined some of the important ideas in the book and it was more clear about three ways. I have already been practicing devops, so, there was not much to learn from what I read. For someone who is not so familiar with the concept, I am sure this book would be a good starting point. I think problems were well described and characters were very realistic. The amount of work done in such a short time, especially implementing those monkeys, was kind of fictional. It pumps IT people so much that, I think any IT person would like to read it :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is great. For the little you may think it does it actually does a lot. It is a very addictive game. Also love the small missions, which gives the game great personality. There is always something to do it always keeps your attention.
B0063IH60K|2.0|But now that I've had it a while, the game has suddenly decided that I have to have an internet connection for it to work.  So much for playing it in the car or places where I don't have service.<br /><br />The moment the app opens, a pop-up window appears that says \\"Internet Needed/ Please connect to the Internet to run this app.\\"  So, that makes it now pretty much useless in my opinion.<br /><br />Prior to this, I would have given it four stars only because the ads are annoying.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is like a magazine that you love. The best part is you get to pick the content. If you are a visual person this is heaven. If you love to learn then this is access to ideas and info. the best part is that you can collect your favorites or just browse.
B000LW7OWE|5.0|What a great wild ride of a movie of The Doors I watched this years ago and had to have it on blu ray 5 stars even better pic and sound get this for you or the doors fan in your life

1419702238|5.0|Well packaged,arrived in excellent condition.not much to say about a gift book for my young granddaughter except that I wouldn't hesitate buying again
1452115567|5.0|This book was even better than I expected. As a photographer myself, the quality of the images are amazing especially with the simplicity of the subject, Maddie and capturing her in these adorable moments. As a dog lover and the mommy of a hound dog, I support the message of rescuing dogs and enjoying the candid moments in life. Keep it up Maddie! <3
1452115567|5.0|Take an entertaining trip around the country from the comfort of your own sofa!  Let Maddie and Theron be your guides!  Fun, interesting photos of Maddie the Coondog taken by her human as they traveled across the Great United States over the course of a year, meeting great folks along the way.  Fabulous gift for a dog lover and photography enthusiast!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun and rewarding. helps kill time when you are bored or waiting.<br />I do however wish that it was more organized on the screen and that I could view more of the upper screen.
B0039RY3MM|5.0|Excellent TIM. I used it on two de-lidded 3770k's and one 3570k. Temps dropped significantly compared to MX4. Can't beat liquid metal.
B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|A sublime band... Muchachisimo This CD continues to astound and tantalize... simply amazing. I wish I was an angelic yodel.
B008MM9630|5.0|Definitely one of the better free games! I really like that you don't need an internet<br />connection to play! Love this game! I really like that
B009KS4XRO|5.0|.I really like this bingo. I like the challenges and it's free. Cities from around the world. Slots are hard tho.
1452115567|5.0|I absolutely love it. And I cannot wait to have Theron (or Maddie) autograph it on the book tour in NYC! :)
B00A89ITZG|4.0|The book is a host of alot of great information. I feel enlightened on the principle goals of crossfit endurance and  loved the  example training schedule.<br />It was a little slow and redundant at points though.
B00BF123WG|4.0|The first hour or so was way too detailed and complex to follow.  If it weren't for the outstanding acting it would have been much less appealing.  The final hour is the best.  However, I would have liked to have seen more of the decision-making process by the president and his advisors.  Still, it's a good movie with great writing, direction, and acting.  Jessica Chastain rocks!
1935182617|5.0|Well written.  They need an even more basic level for me.  The only good book that I could find out there.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a wonderful story of aging and the impacts on a diverse group of Brits.  They choose to maximize their resources by moving to India to the hotel.  It then describes the evolution of the transition on this group.  It is a heart-warming tale of personalities and culture.  Go for it.
0385742886|3.0|This book was picked up in high anticipation because i read The Maze Runner first and that was a great book!  I really enjoyed it.  I could not and can't wait to go read book 2.<br /><br />When i saw this one and saw that it was a prequel, i had to read it.  I thought maybe it would answer some of the questions.<br /><br />Well, i'm sorry... but this book is only \\"OK\\".<br /><br />It's way too long considering the content.<br /><br />I'm glad to learn what happened to the planet.  I'm glad to learn about the virus.  I'm glad to learn how this \\"world\\" as they now know it, came to be.<br /><br />But... i'm HORRIBLY disappointed with how long winded this book is.  I mean come on... this is worse than any movie made where the guy gets beat to snot and yet keeps getting up.  It's like the horror movies where the bad guy is taken down 18 times and yet still gets up one.... more.... time...  UGH.<br /><br />Finally... i'm HORRIBLY disappointed with how truly violent this book is.  Granted the Maze Runner was not a G rate book, but this one... there is no way i'd let my younger teen read this.  It's way to violent and it did not need to be.  It goes back to my last comment... how many times does one get nearly killed but yet seems to keep coming back for more, before you throw your hands up and yell at the book, \\"REALLY?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\\"<br /><br />LOL<br /><br />So for what it's worth... some questions are answered.  It's an OK book... but it is disappointing too for reasons mentioned.<br /><br />I've read worse.  :)<br /><br />That all said... now... on to book 2 to see what becomes of Thomas and his friends.  :)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Yes ... I know this is a cheap way to do it ... but it's better than cutting and pasting, right?  :)<br /><br />If you read the first four, you HAVE to read this one. And you'll be in line for number six. I promise.  :D
0385737955|5.0|This is a book for young adults as the primary age of characters in the book was probably 17.<br /><br />I found this to be a fun and entertaining book.<br /><br />It had some science fiction, action, drama and tradegy all wound up into a great story.<br /><br />When the end came, my immediate thought was... where is book 2... and as i see now here on Amazon, there is not only a book 2, but a book 3, in addition to a Prequel.<br /><br />I just finished the prequel... and frankly... not so great.  Only \\"OK\\".<br /><br />But, The Maze Runner, a great book.  I look forward to book 2.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Gripping, fascinating trilogy. Realistic characters, mysterious settings, and an amazing translation that, I believe, captures the original works very very well.<br />Recommended.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Enjoy this because I have my Kindle with me ALWAYS and can use it for reading, playing games, etc. while on down time - like standing in line somewhere, or waiting at doctor's office, etc.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|It's Game of Thrones people!! George R. R. Martin strikes again -- it's AWESOME. I became hooked on these LONG ago but am just now treating my horrible case of procrastination and doing reviews. ;)<br />Get them! A fascinating world, amazing characterization, vivid action ... excellent!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I truly believe that Ken Follett is the world's best story interpreter and keeps me enthralled in his stories. Just patiently waiting for his next book. You are the greatest Mr. Follett.
B000FGGE68|5.0|Is it because of Milla Jovovich and the fact I like her other movies? Is it because it's futuristically bleak in its gorgeous imagery and graphics? Is it because of that awesome hair?! I don't know. But I do like it. A lot. Maybe you will, too. Give it a shot.  :)
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This is a very well done game and a lotof fun. What i DO NOT like is Amazon telling me i have to log into their app store to play the game. I paid for thi and do not have to be logged in to play. I will never buy another app from the Amazon store again. That is bull! Uninstalling and getting it from Google.
0920668364|5.0|We read this to our children after they were born and now we purchase it for close friends when they are expecting.  Hopefully we can read it to our grandchildren down the road.  Children at all ages need to know they are loved.
B00785P2QC|5.0|To be free this is a great app for wasting time and unlike other apps you don't have to have A internet connection to play very good app a must-have by anyone
B004EPYZZI|5.0|I had heard so many negative things about this movie, that is maybe why I liked it, maybe i was just expecting something much worse. Love Carie Underwood... but she is a TERRIBLE in this movie, other than that, it was great. I would say it is either a kinda bad hollywood film or an AMAZING &#34;B&#34; movie.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I got this because I thought I needed it.<br />But I still have not figured out how to use it.<br />Do some research before you get it.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I have always loved this movie! now it is kindof seen as a goth movie, but i loved it way before Disney got it when buying Touchstone. ANYWAY it is a clever clay-animation/stop-motion movie! With some great songs
B000JMKTLO|4.0|With so many reviews alread postedy, there is not much I can add.  I do, however, want to add my two-cents in the recommendation of this book to fans of [[ASIN:B006LSZECO Gone Girl: A Novel]].  That was the book that introduced me to this author and I loved it (even found the ending to be perfectly fitting which many readers did not care for).  I then went it search of her other novels and downloaded this from my public library last week.<br /><br />My initial impression was that I didn't care for it as much as \\"Gone Girl\\" and early on it was more slow-moving, but I liked it well enough to keep going.  Somewhere around the half way point the pace picked up and the suspense started building.  By the end I was totally caught up in the story and didn't want to put it down.  I will warn readers that this is a dark book but not as violent as you sometimes find.  Most of the actual violence happens off-screen and the reader is exposed to the aftermath.  If you enjoy light and fluffy mysteries such as those in the cozy genre, this one may not be for you.<br /><br />While I didn't think the book was as good as \\"Gone Girl\\", it was still a strong, suspenseful novel.  I will be reading [[ASIN:B0027MJU00 Dark Places: A Novel]] soon.
B001FAFO3W|5.0|I love EVERYTHING about this movie/story. i wish it WAS Disney just so that she would still be relevant! If you have not seen this movie, you will NOT regret buying it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you like a good adventure this is the book for you! When I started  this book I couldn't stop myself from reading this amazing book!!!!
8866131369|5.0|Quality build, great note book. I use it to keep organized every day. The only additional thing I would like is some way to store a pen or pencil with it. Overall absolutely excellent and durable planner / notebook.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Lots of fun.  This match three has great graphics and beautiful imagery. My only complaint is the way the still images scan.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Lot's of layouts, lot's of fun! Easy to use functions.  Wish the tiles were slightly bigger but it's still fun and easy to lose track of time too.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Mr Day-Lewis' performance was very good, if somewhat subdued and sterile.  No doubt hard to perform the role of a man so many of us feel like we know after years and years of reading a multitude of Lincoln biographies.  Hard too, no doubt to put together a concise screenplay that can tell only one bit of one very complicated time and one very complex life.  But somehow I felt the Speilberg production was a bit of a jumble of half-act plays or scenes that didn't seem to be knit too seamlessly.  The photography, altho' a bit dark, and the wardrobing were quite good, but the screenplay, to this Lincoln aficionado, fell short of the hype and my expectations.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this bingo game. I have been playing it for months. I have had other bingo games and none compare. I love the tournaments. I never get tired of playing unlike other bingo games that I have had.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|When I first downloaded this app it just wouldn't work, so I gave it 1 star and a bad review. Since then, it has been updated and the problems that I was having with it have been fixed. I now use this app on a regular basis and love it for taking quick notes and making lists.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I love this sweeper.. it is fantastic for a quick pick up on hard wood floors.  I've speant lots of money trying to find something that would work on hardwoods.  They are all expensive and they do NOT pick up on hardwoods.  This sweeper is AWESOME!!  It does just what is advertised AND I got it for only 20 dollars!!  This is my second sweeper of the same brand same model.  The first one broke after about 2 1/2 years of daily use.. so I didn't hesitate to replace it.  Love it!!!
B007SGM084|2.0|Way too much kinky sex, and not  enuff  plot or story till the third book. The  First two books were more like a very long porn  story than a  novel. It didn't really start having a story till book three.

B00CCFZO6Q|4.0|Everyone's favorite alternative pop band from Versailles, France returns to the scene with a new album!<br /><br />\\"Bankrupt!\\" by Phoenix is good, though it is in the precarious position of having to follow up their amazing 2009 \\"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\\" album. Unfortunately, Bankrupt is no Wolfgang Amadeus, and none of the songs quite reach the caliber of hits such as \\"1901\\" or \\"Lisztomania\\". That's not to say this is a bad album, not by any means, but if you were expecting bigger and better, well you might want to adjust your expectations a bit because you are setting yourself up for disappointment.<br /><br />Phoenix claims that \\"Bankrupt!\\" is an experimental album, but I think that's a bit of a hyperbole as aside from an adjustment of some synths, everything is essentially similar. Upon listening to the album's tracks for the first time, the songs that definitely stand out are \\"Trying to Be Cool\\" and \\"Bourgeois\\". Those two songs in particular have that amazing synth heavy sound that is sure to please long-time fans of Phoenix. After multiple listens, you will start to pick up on the nuances of some of the other songs as well, but not quite on the level of \\"Trying to Be Cool\\" or \\"Bourgeois\\".<br /><br />\\"SOS in Bel-Air\\", \\"Drakkar Noir\\", \\"Chloroform\\" and \\"Don't\\" are pleasing songs but nothing that really stays stuck in your head. It's not necessarily hit and miss, it's just good and that's it. There is a BIG BIG miss on the album though that is worth mentioning and that is the title track \\"Bankrupt!\\". I don't know what the band was going for with this song, but the whole track just feels disjointed and directionless. It starts out strong and then just peters out into nothingness. Before you know it, the song has ended and track 6 starts playing. It's kind of a shame because that's 7 minutes on a 40 minute album that could have been better utilized. Oh well.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Bankrupt!\\" is an enjoyable album. If you are a fan of the band then there is no reason why you should not pick up this album, just don't expect it to be as good as Wolfgang Amadeus. Everyone has varying music tests, so I am sure everybody will have a different opinion, but have a listen and see for yourself!<br /><br />Rating: 4/5 Stars<br />Best Songs: \\"Trying to be Cool\\" & \\"Bourgeois\\" (Definitely in Phoenix's top 10 best songs)

B00B7VPKMY|5.0|This is an awesome collection, better than the Selected Works box set. Every great Eagles song from the 70's in one package. Highly recommended. Seems that some people are knocking the collection because The Long Run is not remastered. Suggestion???? Turn up your stereo!!! :P Seriously - it doesn't matter to me because On the Border, One of the These Nights, and Hotel California are my favorite albums. Get this collection today - a must for every Eagles fan. :o)

0066620996|5.0|\\"I never stopped trying to become qualified for the job.\\"<br /><br />I first learned about Jim Collins at the annual Global Leadership Conference organized by the Willow Creek Association. Though he was promoting a different book, I heard only incredible things about his work Good to Great and at the conference I was fascinated with his understanding of how people and businesses thrive.<br /><br />When I first picked up this book, I was expecting Collins to survey some of the best companies in the nation and tell me a few things these companies have in common. What I did not expect was a thoroughly academically researched investigation into the differences between a good company and a great company.<br /><br />Collins (and his team) systematically walks us through six stages every great works through to move from good to great: Level 5 Leadership, First Who...Then What, Confront the Brutal Facts, The Hedgehog Concept, A Culture of Discipline, and Technology Accelerators. Each stage is so amazingly simple that you feel almost foolish for not knowing it yet each stage is also so profound you wonder how you could ever accomplish it.<br /><br />I really think anyone trying to start a business, save a business, build a charity, or just organize something can benefit from this book. It takes all the complicated issues one can have managing an organization into simple practical words. This is a great book, I look forward to reading Jim Collins other works.<br /><br />\\"What works makes you feel compelled to try to create greatness?\\"
B00541ML4S|5.0|Excellent Olympus lens cap, just what I needed for the lens on my Olympus OMD EM5 camera. Highly recommed it.
0765325950|5.0|The \\"memory of light\\" is the final book and the way Brandon delivered it is really satisfying that - seeing several of his last books - I'm quite sure Robert Jordan himself can't do better. It's not like other modern fantasy where the author gave unclear ending and told us to imagine the rest - or making stupid twist in the plot on final book (yes, that's you Paolini :)). It's also not the unrealistic happy ending where all the main characters alive after the big battles that killed hundred of thousands. Oh yes, casualties ARE high.<br /><br />The main body of the book is consist of the colossal war against the shadow's force. Brandon has a very detailed way in describing how the battles go, including strategies and skirmishes here and there. It went a bit repetitive toward the end, but considering that this is the final battle, it's acceptable without making the book boring. Nevertheless, it's amazing how he describes strategies used by both forces. Both forces keep countering one another and the large never-ending trolloc forces seemed to made up for every blunders the shadow armies made while most errors did by the light forces only made them more and more in a pinch.<br /><br />The three ta'veren fight on different front of the battles, and even each other main characters has their own rule which deciding the result of the battle. I'm not talking only about those who can behead a fade with one of those fancy sword moves or explode a trolloc with one power or creating brilliant war strategies. Min, Faile, and even Olver has their own share of role in deciding the final outcome of the battle.<br /><br />=Spoiler=<br /><br />I liked how Brandon made that \\"compulsion to great captains\\" strategy as an excuse to force Mat to take over the highest command. He's the guy that always trying to run from responsibilities but in the end get the job done anyway. Even when Demandred came with 72-linked-channeler and sa'angreal then blasting his forces away, Mat still can keeping up and making adjustment along the way to preserve his troops and hit where it matters.<br /><br />The way Gawyn kept winning in the past made me think he already at master level, but guess I was wrong. Even wearing those super-booster rings, Demandred didn't even having a hard time disposing him. Galad was a bit better, but I guess he made a mistake of trying to preserve himself while fighting Demandred. Lan made the wisest choice with his kamikaze attack. A bit surprising that the last 2 ended alive though.<br /><br />The death of Egwene, Gawyn, and Siuan were a bit unexpected, but acceptable. Adding Bryne, Rhuac, and Bashere, I think we have decent amount of casualties from the light side. No unrealistic only-minions-die here.<br /><br />Perrin can shift to the wolf dream at will rank him among the strongest fighter even against anyone who wield the one power. No complain there<br /><br />Rand is unable to channel anymore, but gosh, this guy now can wish something and make it happens. He's getting closer to the creator itself! The switched bodies give the Dragon Reborn the death it deserves and a healthy new body for Rand. Didn't expect that one, good one. As for the women, I think Min will be the first to follow Rand since Elayne and Aviendha got all the time they need for their duty before going after Rand<br /><br />Hope you find my review useful
B000000WF0|5.0|Bittersweet Symphony, alone, would be enough to make this a great album even if the rest of the songs weren't any good.  The song is that great, possibly the best song of all-time.  What makes this album a masterpiece is that in addition to Bittersweet Symphony, the album is littered with amazing music.  There are a few weaker songs here, but taken as a whole, it's one of the greats.
B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|I am so happy I ordered this album. This will totally be in my top 5 for the year!! I hope they release another soon!!

0312330863|5.0|This is one of my top three favorite books of all time. Every chapter leaves you laughing or crying. Often both at the same time. If you love animals and enjoy the simple story of a life richly lived, this book is for you. It will touch your heart and leave you a better person for having read it.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|There were moments when I wanted to stop reading this book too grafic with the violence This is not his best work he can tell a story well just not this one hopefully he will read this review

B007VDN1PA|5.0|Recently found alot of old slides from my childhood. Thought those memories would be only on slides or my mind. Taking slides to a processing store was too costly. Now I can reminisce while transfering slides to memory card and computer. Also only have to keep pictures that have meaning to me. This way, I can share my memories with family. Very easy to use.

B000BW9VAM|4.0|Having read some of the reviews that indicated others were having difficulties playing the cd and/or dvd side of this DualDisc release, I ordered this with some trepidation.  I wanted to explore some Talking Heads albums I did not already have (including this one) and only wanted remastered sound, but... if it's a DualDisc that won't play, what's the point?<br /><br />For those not in the know, a \\"DualDisc\\" is a single disc with CD content on one side and DVD content on the other.  I have only one DualDisc title in my collection (Living Colour's \\"Collideoscope\\") and experienced no issues with that one, but the negative comments here made me a little uneasy about ordering this title.<br /><br />Well, I got mine in the mail today and much to my surprise (and delight), it's actually NOT a DualDisc.  What I received was a 2cd slim case with 2 *separate* discs:  Disc 1 = the cd with the original album and 5 audio bonus tracks, while Disc 2 = the DVD content.  Both play fine so I'm definitely relieved that I can enjoy everything here without any annoying technical difficulties or limitations.<br /><br />As to the music, it's TALKING HEADS, truly one of the most original and unique bands of their time!  This debut release shows the band already with a nice mix of the sparse, arty pop/rock and r&b/dance music that would make them more and more famous as their career progressed.  \\"Psycho Killer\\" is perhaps their definitive (early) track. \\"Uh Oh, Love Comes To Town\\" has a solid Motown kind of groove through parts of it but is still pure Talking Heads.  \\"Who Is It?\\" is a short, quirky little number with mimalist lyrics that basically consist of the song's title, but it works.  \\"No Compassion\\" is a frank confession from singer/songwriter David Byrne that he just doesn't have the time to deal with other people's problems, but one with a nice touch of humor (\\"Talk to your analyst; isn't that what they're paid for???\\").  \\"Don't Worry About The Government\\" is a light-hearted and catchy tune with immediate appeal as well.  All told, there's really not a bad track here.  Which is not to say that some aren't better than others, but this debut release is solid throughout and no fluke as their subsequent albums would prove.<br /><br />In addition to the original songs from the debut release, this of course features some early rare songs from 1975-77 that had previously been released only on the 1992 compilation \\"Sand In The Vaseline\\", but they're remastered here and sound much better.  \\"Love >> Building On Fire\\", \\"I Wish You Wouldn't Say That\\" and \\"Sugar On My Tongue\\" are as good as anything on the album so it's great to have them added here as bonus tracks.  There is also a previously unreleased outtake from the \\"Talking Heads: 77\\" sessions (\\"I Feel It In My Heart\\") which did not immediately strike me as one of their best, but it's decent.  The \\"acoustic\\" version of \\"Pyscho Killer\\" sounds less different from the studio version than I would have expected and David Byrne sings some completely different lyrics than the ones we're used to from the studio version, so while it's an interesting version to explore, I much prefer the original studio version.<br /><br />The 2nd DVD disc includes the original album in 5.1 Surround Sound, a photo gallery and two bonus concert videos (\\"Pulled Up\\" & \\"I Feel It In My Heart\\"), none of which really grabs me, but it was worth the price just to get the original album and 5 bonus tracks in excellent remastered sound.<br /><br />For an intro to this band, I would probably go with the 2-disc expansive \\"Sand In The Vaseline\\" compilation, which is absolutely superb (if they remaster it, I'll buy it again!) or the single disc \\"Best of the Talking Heads\\", which is not as many tracks as the 2cd \\"Sand\\" title, but does feature better sound.  Both have choice selections from this album and more and are excellent throughout.  If you're past the point of compilations and want an original studio release, this ain't a bad place to start, and if you have an old copy of \\"Talking Heads: 77\\" and want improved sound, I would definitely recommend this title.o start, and if you have an old copy of \\"Talking Heads: 77\\" and want improved sound, I would definitely recommend this title.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Runs fairly well on my Galaxy Nexus.<br /><br />Levels do get boring fairly quickly, but the sandbox mode is where all the fun is at.<br /><br />One big drawback is trying to grab things on a smallish screen with my fat fingers. The DS screen is smaller but its stylus allows for more precision.
B00377V6IS|5.0|If you're lookin at his album wih any doubt just buy it already!!!  I was somewhat nervous about this album, but to say the least, it is amazing!!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I had wanted to watch this for quite some time and finally was able to do that over this past weekend.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the historical value was portrayed in this movie.  I am sure many months of research went into this to get it as close to accurate as possible.  Lincoln was truly a remarkable man in the way in which he worked the congress to achieve the votes needed for the 13th amendment.  One can only begin to imagine how difficult that was at that point in our history to pull off.  It also shows how nothing has changed related to the partisan approach to the decision making process between the two parties!  Both Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Fields were terrific in the parts they played an many others as well.  If you have not seen it yet you need to.
B000W74EQC|4.0|I always liked this movie the best out of the series i guess because it introduces you to so much. Great start to a new adventure if you haven't seen it which i can't image.
B005F9TQ4C|5.0|Like the above stated, my little member is finally growing on me. No, please forgive me, I  just added humor.  I like this album, not saying this is his best, but it's very good. Changing Of The Gaurds, Senor, are the only standouts so far, but I'm still in the early stages  of listening to this album. Some Dylan albums are like that. They have to grow on you. I will improve my review at a later time. Thanks for listening, and reading my review. Enjoy.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I read the canon when I was quite young, in my teens. It's like a visit from a long lost friend from long ago!!! Not only is Sherlock Holmes the gold standard for detective fiction, he also represents one of the best examples of the classic Victorian eccentric English gentleman.
B00026WU3M|5.0|What in the world can I even say about one of Dylan's last great albums. Shooting Star is one of my all time favorites. Ring Them Bells is a glorious gem of a song, worthy of the word masterpiece. I'm not saying this is the best album Dylan has made. But it's the last time I felt this good  listening to a Dylan record. In other words, it didn't have to grow on me. Buy it,  You will love it. Thanks.
0920668372|5.0|My parents used to read this book to us, and my siblings and I all loved it growing up. We made it into a song as well, and now my husband and I have it in our children's libraries to read and sing to them. It's an adorable book about growing up and changing but always keeping your family love strong.
B003U2QHB6|3.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid/teen. Going back and rewatching it reminds me of why loved it.
B008LG6SXS|5.0|responsible booking and serious management of your time.  Swift organization that cares for the traveler. We gave used for 5 years on our trips to visit family in Spain.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This was a gift for my husband.  He is a huge Alien fan and had to have the boxed set of course!  He loves these movies.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|Really enjoy listening to this album, and I really liked the Autorip feature!<br />I'm a big Nicki fan so I had to get the Re-Up!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a gift for my husband.  Of course he already owned all of the movies on DVD, but we had to get the Blu-Ray set when it was re-mastered and released.  He loved it!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I just love this Notebooks app!  I have published 5 novels and am also a blogger.  I don't know how I ever survived before I got this app on my Kindle Fire.  Now, I can jot down scene ideas, sections of dialogue or ideas for blog posts whenever they come into my head - even when I'm in bed!  It's very handy for writing in the car while traveling and so much easier for writing in bed than a bulky laptop.  The only bad side is now I'm finding it harder to fall asleep because I will lay in bed and write after my husband has fallen asleep and then my mind won't shut off!  I was a little nervous about getting it at first, and wondered how much I would use it, but it's super-easy to use and I find I am using it every day!
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|I bought this a week before the Push the Sky Away US tour, and instantly fell in love with it.  It easily stands up with the later, more polished albums like The Boatman's Call and Lyre of Orpheus.  And then I saw the tour in Bethesda, MD.  Nick put on a great show, playing a nice mixture of new and old stuff.  It was awesome.  Highly recommended for the later-era Nick Cave fan, or those who like all of his stuff.
0544002318|4.0|\\"Eat & Run\\" should have been titled \\"Run, Run Some More, and Then Keep Running. And Eat Vegan.\\"<br /><br />While this book generated a lot of buzz in the vegan world, champion ultramarathoner Scott Jurek and co-author Steve Friedman focus much more on running than on veganism.<br /><br />But that's OK, so long as you like running and/or reading about running. A lot of running.<br />Jurek makes an earnest attempt to describe the unusual psyche of a champion ultramarathoner  and to explain how he accomplishes such incredible feats of endurance.<br /><br />Additionally, in the fashion of a good memoir, he candidly describes the strains in several of his interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />But while he was quite open in relating the ups and downs of his relationships with his father and best friend, he writes little about his ex-wife. This is a major omission, leaving readers to wonder how his obsession with running affected his marriage.<br /><br />Vegan readers - well, hopefully all readers - will appreciate the recipes found at the end of each chapter. I can personally attest to the deliciousness of the \\"Incan Quin-Wow\\" recipe.<br /><br />If nothing else, Jurek will convince you that going vegan is a heckuva lot easier than running an ultramarathon.
B0076DELIG|3.0|OK any Bosh to me is worth reading. I am an avid fan. But.......this is my least favorite of. ALL. I would advise new readers to start with another, better, Bosh. There are blessedly many out there. Read this one after you have acquired the \\"Bosh Bug\\"
B002NXSRVG|5.0|They make everything in this film become so cool. I feel like every single movie series, the first one is the best.( except some films).
B0002EXH54|5.0|PEACE SELLS is a TOTAL THRASH CLASSIC, among the best MEGADETH ever created!!!! WAKE UP DEAD, THE CONJURING, DEVIL´S ISLAND, BLACK FRIDAY and the absurd classic title track are THRASH gems, from a period in time where THRASH METAL ruled the world!!!!! PEACE SELLS, with RUST IN PEACE and COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION are the MEGADETH albums i like more, and i totally love this legendary band!!!!!MEGADETH RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't stop reading! So much suspense and so many twists! Such a unique change of perspectives and so much thought
B000002LRX|5.0|While THE REAL THING is a complete MASTERPIECE, i  think ANGEL DUST is even more BRILLIANT and UNIQUE!!!! It´s a fantastic trip through HEAVY METAL, FUNK and even some great RAP....Patton was at his peak of creativity, and change his vocals from track to track smoothly... MIDLIFE CRISIS, SMALL VICTORY, LAND OF SUNSHINE, CAFFEINE.....Man, ANGEL DUST RULES!!!!! I completely recommend this one and FAITH NO MORE´s entire catalogue for some of the best, unique HEAVY MUSIC you can find in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Play gets more complicated as you go.  Nice stress free game. Colorful display which I like as well.  I enjoy this game.
B0045DO8LA|5.0|Riot Act is one of the best Pearl Jam albums!!!! Some great songs like Cant Keep, Ghost, Save you, I am Mine and You Are.....Highly recommended if you think Ten and Vs are some of the best music ever created!!!Well done, Pearl Jam!!!!
0316017930|5.0|I am a psychologist who specializes in personality.  This book is excellent.  The author does excellent research and presents issues in a very engaging manner.  All around great read!!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Oh, yes.....BINAURAL and the uninspired RIOT ACT are not so memorable, but them the legendary PEARL JAM created another AMAZING collection of HEAVY songs....This album with the fruit in the cover is like a fusion between YIELD and their classics TEN and VS....Even the ballads here are more HEAVY ROCK than soft....Some songs are instant gems like GONE, SEVERED HAND, WORLD WIDE SUICIDE and MARKER IN THE SAND!!!! I truly love the great PEARL JAM, but RIOT ACT was a letdown.....THIS ONE ROCKS!!!! WELL DONE, PEARL JAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|\\"Django Unchained\\" is probably the best RomCom that I've ever seen, far better than any of those Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan flops such as \\"You've Got Mail.\\"  What, you think that \\"Django Unchained\\" is NOT a RomCom?<br /><br />You've surely got romance.  What could be more romantic than a night in shining armor -- or at least a cowboy on a horse -- travelling cross country to find his long lost love?  And you've surely got comedy.  What could be more comical than watching a cameo of Quentin Tarantino with him finally get his just desserts?<br /><br />And speaking of Mr. Tarantino:  I've been hit and miss with him over the years.  I'm not a fan of violence for violence's sake.  I thought that \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" was pretty much torture porn, an unwatchable movie that promoted violence, particularly against cops.  But then I really liked \\"Inglorious Basterds,\\" a film that, while surely violent -- a home run shot to someone's head is surely violent, isn't it? -- was also very funny and well thought out.  And \\"Django Unchained\\" to me is more like \\"Basterds\\" as, yes, there is violence.  But there is reason for that violence.<br /><br />And there is reason for Jamie Foxx to kill everyone in sight, up-to-and-including Samuel L. Jackson.  Particularly Mr. Jackson.  A lot has been made of the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio was once again snubbed for his terrific performance here by the Academy.  The \\"logical\\" thinking went as follows:  \\"How can you give an Oscar to someone who uses the N-word like 1000 times in one film?\\"  Well, from what I remember, Mr. DiCaprio didn't write the dialog; that would have been the job for Mr. Tarantino.  But Mr. Tarantino did win I believe for best direction, so the logic really falls apart here.  But the one guy that I wanted to see die in this film the most:  Mr. Jackson.  He is the worst kind of slimeball, the worst kind of suck up.  But he didn't write his lines or actions either.<br /><br />(It should be noted that I saw Mr. Foxx on \\"Saturday NightLive\\" last year, and hated his performance.  I turned it off fairly quickly.  He went way over the line; no doubt about it.  However, I am generally able to separate the art from the artist, and so I still watched this film later and thought that his performance was fantastic.  I would strongly advise him never to pull a stunt like that SNL monologue again, however.  Otherwise, I will lose my patience with him and I won't separate the art from the artist with regards to him again.)<br /><br />One scene that maybe didn't quite work for me:  Christoph Waltz, who gives another terrific performance but this time as the \\"good guy.\\"  He does something that went against his character at one point.  I won't say what he does, but it would have made more sense to have Django do it as then the characters' behaviors and motivations would have been more consistent.  However, they did need someone to do this \\"thing\\" as a plot device to drive the third act.  I think that you'll know what I mean when you see the film.<br /><br />We can argue all day long about the genre of the film, whether it's a RomCom, whether it's a Western, whether it's this or that.  But what surely is not arguable:  \\"Django Unchained\\" is a whole lot of fun.  But I'll give a big pass on the Academy, who dropped the ball once again by not nominating one of the greatest actors of our generation with another excellent performance:  Leonardo DiCaprio.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|BATTLE OF LOS ANGELES, the 3rd album from RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE is another great collection of HEAVY songs from this great band....I still think their debut and EVIL EMPIRE are better, but this one got great tunes like TESTIFY, SLEEP NOW IN THE FIRE, CALM LIKE A BOMB and GUERRILLA RADIO!!!!!It´s RAGE´s last album, but maybe is better this way....They created 3 MASTERPIECES and stop in time to be a legend!!!!!!
B000002UZ1|5.0|Great Cd.  Having lived through this era during my early teen years, I had to have this Cd for my music collection. Best collection of the Beatles hits for the time .  The Cd was in great shape for  used, and the lyric pages  is very nice to have..............amazing that I remembered a lot of the lyrics ...............but remembered some of them wrong  ;-)  Buy the  red Cd to have  8 years of the best Beatles music hits ever!
B0000028RR|5.0|WOW!!! RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE´s debut is one of the greatest albums EVER!!!!! It´s something REALLY unique, blending perfectly HEAVY METAL with FUNK, with brilliant RAP vocals!!!!! All the songs rules like the HUGE HIT KILLING IN THE NAME, FREEDOM, BULLET IN YOUR HEAD, TAKE THE POWER BACK and WAKE UP!!!!!This one and EVIL EMPIRE are MASTERPIECES!!!!! REALLY GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003YNFYCO|5.0|I needed some Beatles  for our music collection.<br />this is the best collection of hit songs  by the Beatles for this time period.  I should know, as I was a  young teen through these years.<br />The used cd was in great shape and plays like new and the lyric sheet is great too.
B0002EXH40|5.0|I really really like YOUTHANASIA, one of the many masterpieces MEGADETH created....it´s clearly a more polished album, where many can say MEGADETH sell out their HEAVY sound.....well, a little(TOUT LE MOUND)...But YOUTHANASIA got plenty AMAZING songs to be a MASTERPIECE from this legendary band....The first 3 songs are among MEGADETH´s best, and KILLING ROAD, BLACK CURTAINS, I THOUGHT I KNOW IT ALL and the title track are all first class METAL tunes.....This is really not a THRASH METAL album, but a great METAL album filled with gems!!!!!! WELL DONE, MEGADETH!!!!!!!!!
0887081770|4.0|We love the book and the pop ups are sturdy (toddler can't tear them out).  I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't so small - this is a SMALL book!
B000002NG7|5.0|ALBUM OF THE YEAR, unfortunately is the last album from one of my favourite bands, the great legendary FAITH NO MORE.....well, maybe it´s better this way....FAITH NO MORE ends before they started to record some uninspired work, leaving a hall of classic remarkable songs.....Here you got the gems STRIPSEARCH, LAST CUP OF SORROW and ASHES TO ASHES, and other great tunes like COLLISION, MOUTH TO MOUTH, NAKED IN FRONT OF COMPUTER and GOT THAT FEELING....I really enjoy the whole album!!!!! it´s their last MASTERPIECE....enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was one I could not put down! This love story has a thrilling story line and keeps you on edge.
B000003C4K|5.0|yes, BONDED BY BLOOD is the major classic of the great legendary THRASH band EXODUS....It´s a unique beast, because is the only album with the insane vocals of Paul Baloff....This album is filled with THRASH gems like the title track, EXODUS, METAL COMMAND, STRIKE OF THE BEAST and PIRANHA!!!!! I really love this classic, almost in par with REIGN IN BLOOD and MASTER OF PUPPETS....WELL DONE, EXODUS!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game!  I love it!  It is exciting and fun and it keeps my kids and I occupied for hours.
B000002IZ4|5.0|After a huge classic from the early 90´s like CORE, the STONE TEMPLE PILOTS was at their peak of creativity and recorded this great album PURPLE!!!!! It´s a great album, in par with CORE...GREAT PURPLE!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|everything works and looks great, but could not get the volume very loud, otherwise I like it, especially the dimming capabilities
B000021XR5|5.0|After 3 REALLY GREAT albums, where the first(CORE), in my opinion is a MASTERPIECE, STONE TEMPLE PILOTS created this No 4 album.....It´s BY FAR their heaviest album, where you can hear heavy guitars through ALL the songs like DOWN, PRUNO, SEX AND VIOLENCE and HEAVEN E HOT RODS, also got 2 cool ballads like SOUR GIRL and ATLANTA....well, it´s the last one i really enjoy from these guys.....GREAT ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. I love that the second temple run is a lot more challenging than the first temple run.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game. It helps you pass time.  It especially<br />makes you use your brain and think.  I would recommend it.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Super fast shipping I love Amazon Prime package came complete totally satisfied would recommend To all people who watch the movie the new comers watch the movie this is a must buy & see
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Only issue was between level it would lock-up and I would have to exit/start once more.  I am using the Pandigital Planet.
B005DJREJS|4.0|You know what - I'm slightly emberrased to say this, but I did like this and found it funny! It's irreverent and vulgar but yet the show is charming enough to keep me coming back...
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Fantastic show. Incredible acting and story lines. The boxed set is really quite remarkable. The packaging is great and I love the episode guide.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Really like it challenging and I fun playing the game with friends.  You will really like it as much as we do.
B008P9M614|5.0|Great show with wonderful acting. I really enjoy it. I only wish the series had run longer. It's a must have.
1439156816|5.0|Loved reading about King's life and writing journey. I found his no-nonsense writing advice to be more useful than what I learned in some of the writing classes I took years ago.
B00AIJP9BS|4.0|FAOTD download on Kindle Fire.<br />Game play is not intuitive but after playing around it seems like a mix between pinball and marble madness on a soccer field.<br /><br />You simply can affect the strength of each kick by pulling back in the opposite direction of your target. Ball flight can be influenced by the tilt of the device.  it would be improved by settings that allow you to Pi k length of match, quality of opponents and perhaps to make it interesting amount of grad pity or friction.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|This cpu is fast,For the price its hard to beat cant find any faults. Does not get hot i'm very happy with this product !!!
B00AIJP9BS|1.0|I am not going to make this a long drawn out review. I wasn't given enough time to do that. I did play the game for a few minutes, with unrefined controls and just too complex for a platform like a touch screen mobile device. What shortened my playing time, thus, giving it it's one star rating was when I chose to calibrate my device. I waited and waited then waited some more but &quot;wait&quot; wouldn't clear off my screen. It was stuck in calibration mode. Dev, you need to fix this before I attempt this game again. That and the controls. Also, maybe make it clear how to adjust the camera angle. Give it a try. You may have better luck with it but my impression is; It just isn't quite ready for prime time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like it a lot. graphics are very good. I like the way it looks like you are playing the real game.
0811876373|5.0|I just received my book, is very beautiful, the quality is very good in terms of quality impressions and plaster.<br />In terms of content is quite enlightened, has many color photographs and explains everything step by step. It is very cute!
B005KQVDH8|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies! Looks great on blu-ray. It will still make you laugh. I highly suggest you buy this movie!
B00BG23LYS|4.0|Do you like Uncles?<br />Do you like Acid?<br />Do you like deadbeats?<br />Do you like Minds?<br />Do you like Control?<br /><br />If so then this is for you!<br /><br />If the idea of Black Sabbath's Master of Reality being reimagined though Junior's Eyes floats your Doom laden boat then this is for you.<br />It's not all like that though \\"Death Valley Blues\\" is Master of Reality seen through Junior's Eyes as done by the Beatles.<br /><br />Loses a star for Uncle's vocals (Ozzy as done by Neil Young) not being as high in the mix as on Blood Lust, but there is still minor mellotronic input.<br /><br />Overall that's a BUY them. My mind is controlling yours: BUY! BUY! BUY!
B007O4XX9K|4.0|I bought this after seeing Joe Walsh on Guitar Center sessions and was very impressed with his music and message.  If you like Joe Walsh you will love this recording.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this TV series.  The characters are so vast and the thought put into the story each week is amazing.  To watch these diverse group of people as they confront not only the &#34;walking dead&#34; but the emotions within themselves is truly thought provoking on my part!  The zombies may be &#34;silly&#34;, for the lack of a better term, but no matter what the devastation is or could be we will react and our true selves will be exposed.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone!<br /><br />Can't wait to watch The Walking Dead: Third Season!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|decided to play one of G5 's HO games and been hooked ever since. Lucky for me G5 was offering a selection of HO games for. 99 cents and the Abyss : Wraiths of Eden was 1 of them. I like HO games with a story line and mini games throughout. This game was well worth. 99 cents and would highly recommend this to those who like a challenge with HO games.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I thought the first one was bad but this is worse. I'm on the third so far just as disappointed as this book and book 1
B009AMANBA|3.0|Though I saw many similarities in Congress THEN and Congress NOW, I couldn't see making such a epic production from Director Spielberg.  I had to really concentrate on watching, much as I did in high school focusing on a lecture from a history teacher.  I wonder if Lincoln would choose to be a Republican today?
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was amazing and it was good. Love this book. Read a book more carefully like a dictionary book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I enjoyed watching the series and would recommend this if you want good, clean entertainment.  I can't wait for the next season to come out
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very good game only one thing when is the updates coming out this is worth every cent
0670026638|5.0|Have not finished yet. The pages just melt with all the content they have, whether it is about zen, about bullying, about Whaletown.<br />It is filled with wisdom, thought provoking guestions. Love the old grandmother, the sad father, Ruth the writer, and Nan the young girl. The character portrayal is so all incompositing, at times you are a &#34;time being&#34;<br />Highly recommend this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I couldn't put it down the first day. Every day more rewards and its so intuitive that my fingers flash. My children enjoy it so much they &quot;forget&quot; homework.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|shows you how to take care of a horse and what u need to feed and nature your animal.  love it
B009UNGYHG|5.0|The idea is clever - a case for your headset that is also a secondary power source. Great for travelers, in particular.<br /><br /> The case is well made and hopefully the plastic used in the cover is tough enough to survive being carried in pockets and the like.<br /><br /> Operation couldn't be simpler. Plug it in and the reserve battery charges, Put the headset in the case and it charges too.<br /><br /> I did some testing and the secondary battery will fully recharge the headset battery.<br /><br /> Summing up, I'm glad I bought this. It not only provides protection for the headset, but will recharge it as well. The unit is light, small and (for whatever it's worth) stylish. My only complaint is that I think it is somewhat overpriced.<br /><br />Jerry
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|My daughter never got to watch the movie I paid for because it wouldn't download on my tablet while we were at a hotel with nothing on t.v. for her. She was very disappointed.
B000NY12LO|5.0|From the first page Jodi has you hooked on the story. This is one of her best! At first you are horrified by what happened at the school...but as you read about the events that lead up to it, you suddenly don't know whose side you are on.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Excellent Series. Looking forward to Season three DVD. Absolutley recommend you get it on Blue-Ray. The picture quality is fantastic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book gave me a new perspective on life. I laughed just as hard as I cried...which was a lot. Seriously, so inspiring and not too heavy.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|OK, I'm maybe the only one in this boat, but, I would think the characters would be after more types of weapons....I mean, a 22 cal at short range is lethal.....and since bullets are probably zillions of em laying around.... even if you didn't use the 22 for walkers, it could be used for hunting.....  (What's for dinner???  &#34;We got us a 'five point' buck RAT!!!'  Yummy!!!....er.....Toasted?&#34;)  Actually, I love the show, the acting is great, the characters are all very interesting!  It's just that there are things I've seen that could be used that haven't!  So, everything is screwed up, the characters are usually in a panic, but I still think that they would be on the lookout for goodies that haven't been snatched up....  This is a season 3 review, but I remember in the season 1 episode &#34;TS-19&#34; that when the characters were approaching the CDC that there were needed guns laying around and no one bothered to grab any!  Also, someone could grab one of those Armor plated &#34;Hummers&#34; !!  Oh well, I still love the show, and I'll keep watching!!  (but C'mon guys!  I have a big bore blow gun...(bought right here at Amazon!)  and a Laser sighted slingshot!  Do you need me to send them to you????  .....er.....  ahem.....  ;)
B000UPGQQW|5.0|With the two Cory's, it is the best one made.  Wish they would have made a 2nd with them before the hoopla...still the best classic vamp around.
1616550414|5.0|I'm not one to buy books about games but this is one of those must have books. Book wasn't that expensive but I would have payed triple what I payed for this book. It has everything that you could possibly want in the book.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I am now anxiously awaiting the next installment!  I got the pre-order and I do not regret it!  I got it early and watched it the day it arrived.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The screenplay is written very well so that everything is set up and paid off.<br /><br />The soundtrack is simply amazing.<br /><br />Excellent acting by the entire cast.<br /><br />Overall a visual masterpiece.<br /><br />This does not just follow the novel, it also incorporates additional lore of Middle Earth from Tolkien's writings.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is exactly what I've been looking for, at a price that cannot be beat. As long as the watch holds up, as I believe Seiko's do, then it will be one of the better purchases I've made. I have many watches (some of which are very high end) and this is quickly becoming my go to everyday watch. I changed the band to something a little classier per my taste. Unbeatable purchase so far.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I know there are people who hated this film because of the plot or whatever, but as a history geek, the parallels to American history and Manifest Destiny are enough to make me drool.<br /><br />Yes the acting leaves a little bit to be desired, but the costumes, set design, special effects, and soundtrack more than make up for Sam Worthington's shortcomings.<br /><br />... and the historical connections!!! *drool*
B009RH973I|5.0|My daughter received this case for Christmas and really loves it!  No problems at all...just the right fit. Looking to purchase another.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Something about this song feels timeless. It is a very versatile track that I could image being played anywhere. Daft Punk has found a way to maintain their identity while departing from what we would have expected and yet still push edm farther. They are true innovators.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|The first copy I received didn't work correctly, but it was easily and quickly exchanged. The sound quality is great and the music is beautiful.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great read and lots of twists and turns! The author writes well and used detail to draw this imaginary world! Great ending
B00AIJP9BS|1.0|Game play is terrible. Music isn't bad. I didn't see how they could do foosball on android, and I still don't see how they could. This is nothing like foosball. The ONLY similarity is that the game pieces are set up in foosball pattern. You can't move any of the pieces, you can't control the power behind the ball very well. It is way too easy to knock the ball out of bounds.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderful read and insight into teenagers dealing with life and cancer. Great story line and character development. Loved the connection with other literature works
1451668945|3.0|MHC has always loaded up her books with plenty of characters so I make a list of names right from the start so I can keep track.<br /><br />The book was disappointing, figuring out the bad guy was obvious from almost the introduction.  That works if you are watching \\"Columbo\\" but it's not the style for which Clark is famous.  Her books are usually full of red herrings and it's almost nail biting to the end \\"Who, who, who???\\"<br /><br />I have always enjoyed her style of writing, the switching perspective and uncovering the bad guy layer by layer.  That is here, what is missing is any true suspect other then the most obvious one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Keeps you in the book everything turns in a matter of seconds. Suspenseful all the way til the end. Great book
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Good movie, lots of action, a bit too long.  If you are a fan of the Middle Earth, you will enjoy it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|So reminds me of Myst.  Wonderful graphics.  Even down to the old wooden screwdriver that gave such atmosphere.  You could feel your hand on it.  Very ingenious. Makes you think.  Won't be for everyone but it is for me.  Want more!!!
0062059963|5.0|I tried to remeber what I did not liked from The Elite. I really did and nothing comes to my mind with one exception. Maxon and the way the girls. All the girls including America. But he is looking for a wife so his behaviour is understandable. Also in the first chapters they seemed like a sure thing but then they are not. Aspen for me could simply not exist in the book and America became more likeable to me as the book was processing.<br /><br />The end left me expecting a lot from the third book and I am looking forward to see America trying to win. America and Aspen's relationship was almost through all the book the same as we had seen it in The Selection when he arrived at the palace. America and Maxon's though has ups and downs. First everything seemed so perfect and good but America's inability to choose forced Maxon to consider that he might have to choose another girl to be his wife. In the end I think the triangle is not a triangle anymore but America knows who she wants. I want to see a bada*s America (as bada*s someone can be in this genre) The rebels attacked more frequently which leads me to think that in the end of the trilogy Illea might not have a king and Queen. (It's not spoiler, just a guess). As a team Maxon girl I would hate not to see him together with America.<br /><br />After reading some reviews pre-release of the Elite I saw what some Selection readers wanted from the Elite I can say that Kiera Cass must have satisfied many of them because she included everything.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies...all time...I've only bought 4 movies ever to watch over and over again...<br />and, while Hugh Jackman is my 70 year old fantasy, I can't say enough for all the performances in this<br />movie.  The degree of passion, the staging, the music...I didn't think they could do it...they more than did.<br />I can watch now without crying, but it moves me every time.
0393317552|3.0|It was a little damaged on the side of the book, but it is ok for the price, since it was a used book.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is very good fun as long as you are willing to put in some time it really makes you think about planning
B004XVN1T4|4.0|I bought this book while waiting for new issues of books on my want to read list. I like Ken Follet's works & this book did not disappoint. It was hard to follow all the threads & lies, but that made it very entertaining & realistic, at least to me.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This might be the oddest novel I've read in a decade.  All the while I was reading it, I was thrilled at the way Gaiman wove the story.  I really couldn't put it down.  The strangest part for me was that I couldn't get to know or understand the main character - I never had any feelings for him, which is very odd indeed.  An amazing bit of writing.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Nice relaxing game could be easier too use on the kindle .but other wise a very nice mystery find it.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|The material was fantastic, good-looking and sturdy. I could rely on the case to protect my phone if I dropped it. The black rubber part works good to keep the phone from scuffing up and the hard plastic shell makes it good for handling. There are many color options available, and I plan to buy a few more color's. This is a well designed product and very reliable. Good job Spigen.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|Debbie Macomber has a way with words that immediately pulls the reader into her story. I love her series of stories so I can follow along with the story lines and characters. Her books are timeless with no age boundaries, I know I'll enjoy her books years from now as I do today.
6301174240|5.0|This is a classic video of a legend. I loved it. If it can be put on DVD, I see it as a great sale.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I have ordered 4 of these for myself and friends. The first one had a smalled plastic surround around the actuat Lightning connector , and the second and third had large plastic surrounds.  Those large plastic surrounds barely fit cases such as the Belkin and Griffin products, but they did actually fit. Of course the smaller plastic surround has no issue fitting.<br /><br />I just got this one, my fourth, and it has the original small plastic surround. A welcome change back.<br /><br />Also I've noticed that the ones with the smaller plastic surround have a bettter coiled cable.  The cable on these is not as rigid and can stretch a little from the coiled status. The other ones have very rigid plastic and you have to pull so hard to get them to stretch that the Lightnign cable comes out of the phone sometimes.<br /><br />So good luck, I hope you get the better smaller plastic version with the better plastic cable. However, even if you don't the other version is still the best on the market, so you shoudl order no matter what but be aware of the differences. Maybe if you go to the store you could look at a few a see the difference.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|fun game to play. love all the cut the rope games. def worth the 99 cents. can't wait for the updates. keep the nom nom coming please.
B000LXHK22|5.0|Who wouldnt like such a touching love story?? I felt like I could live in France after watching this film
B003M2DWE4|2.0|I purchased this clock so my kid (3, now 4) could tell when it was late enough to leave his room in the morning. We don't need an alarm function now, though it would be nice to have the option when the kid doesn't get up before sunrise...<br /><br />The way the clock works is that you have to select an alarm time, and the alarm is then set by pushing one of the buttons on the top of the clock, instead of flipping a switch underneath. So if my kid touches/plays with the clock at all, he will inevitably turn on the alarm function inadvertently. The alarm sound is a loud unpleasant beep, which lasts for a long time. Then we hear an incessant beeping from his room, which is just plain unwelcome. I wish it was designed differently.
B00000IUT7|5.0|My little boy has just had the non-motorized engine for his track. We got this for his birthday and he has loved it.<br /><br />Plus - the battery is hidden well. My little boy loves to tinker and I was worried he'd break it trying to figure out where the battery goes but he has been having so much fun with it he hasn't even worried about opening it up.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I was really looking forward to learning more about developing valuable habits as a result of reading this book. The book provides a wealth of stories of other people's habits -- which are inspiring, but it doesn't give direct lessons on how one can develop their own good habits. I enjoyed the book and I do recommend it, but if you're looking for a step-by-step guide on developing positive habits you might want to look elsewhere.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Bought this because the &#34;one night&#34; song and LOVE the whole album. Really great and upbeat. Not one song on the album that isn't great
B001R4MEUM|5.0|I've always considered this album as one Genesis greatest works. Always pleasing to my ear from vocals to rythems etc.
B006YC74E8|4.0|its alright you can customize and edit your pics *like effects and colors*, if your looking for an app to do that, this is the one
B005LAIHSG|2.0|Watched this movie on Showtime or other premium cable channel. Was very let down with Kistern Stewarts acting or lack there of. Charlene Theron was excellant in her role but she could not cover for Kistern Stewarts lack luster performace. Left me with not wanting to add this movie into my library for a that rainey day when there is really nothing to watch or the satilite is not working, right. Not cable which is why I started my owne private library to begin with.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|The history interesting and its pretty entertaining but not that great, but i would keep watching it just to see.
B001HDWKMA|3.0|I like Ray Lamontagne but his albums tend to be very quiet and melancholy.  The first track gave me some hope that this album may be a bit more upbeat but unfortunately the overall album is more of the same.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I loved it, and the quality and sound is amazing as well. The movie itself is great, it makes you think a lot about yourself and your beliefs in the end and its an amazing story.
