B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is one of the best games on my tablet.  I love it and my kids love it too. Not too much gore and highly addictive.  And for it to be the full game for free....I mean u cant go wrong.  I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone.  Also, I have been playing this game alot and haven't had any problems or glitches at all.  If I could give this game 100 stars I would..... it really is a wonderful free game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It's addictive but in a good way. Just when you think \\"no way out\\" it comes to you and the doors open.  Looking forward to the next set of floors.
B000FS9MV0|2.0|First of all, Renee has an absolute beautiful voice - BUT, what an absolutely forgettable album.  Unfortunately, Renee wasted her time on this CD --- I hope in the future she will be more particular on her song selection.  I gave this CD 2*, instead of 1 because of her enchanting voice.  What a sad follow-up to her namesake CD which was simply amazing!
B00CDBZ6NA|5.0|Eric Schlosser is a brilliant researcher and writer. I served on a Strategic Air Command Bomber in the 1960's carying 4 MK28YI 1.1 MT bombs and two Hound Dog Nuclear Missiles targeted against Moscow and other urban centers, and later as an F-100 Pilot in Turkey targeted off ground alert against soviet airfields with 345 KT B-61 Nuclear Bombs.<br /><br />During Nuclear Alert the feared General Powers once visited our Alert Facility and had us standing tall and in awe of his powers.<br /><br />Schlosser shows remarkable skill in capturing the dangers and insane targeting strategy and competition for more bombs and missiles between the Services.  Without saying it directly, he captures the danger of the political Military Industrial complex that demands endless resources without regard to society or mankind.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the second installment of the Mortal Instruments. I found myself sneaking off to read any chance I could. It's fun and imaginative and unpredictable! I keep trying to figure out what is next and that's what is so spellbinding. I can't stop reading and eagerly await the next book.

B00C6B887S|5.0|If you love fantasy movies, WATCH THIS FILM.<br /><br />The plot is Dramatic and good, the Aacting is great, it's funny and sad<br />the Monsters are just amazing, better then Lord of the rings monsters and demons,<br />the CGI is superb, everything is new and fresh and big, this movie is just big!<br /><br />Its really good the directing, acting, action and CGI are amazing<br />Same director as Pacific Rim and you can see it, huge monsters, very colorful, very fantasy and very good
B00008438V|5.0|I love this movie, this was a gift to my son.<br />He was a small one when this movie came out.<br />It was a preferred movie, that I approved of!
B009WUBERW|5.0|Crash, boom, bang.  Lots of bad guys getting wasted by awesome weapons.  Cool toys, poor attempt at drama...everything guys like in movies!
B00F35B8F8|3.0|I would prefer to have seen this movie as a new episode instead of redoing a perfectly good movie.  I don't understand why it was necessary unless there is a lack of writing talent available.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|So..... The story is very basic, 2 people going  mmmm someplace crash on earth,<br />The war hero Cypher is hurt and has to sit in a chair the entire movie while his little annoying son Kitai must embark on a perilous journey to signal for help. to try and get help and get out of the planet.<br />And why Do they use some spear sword weapon and no guns ????<br /><br />So far plot is boring, no Twists, nothing interesting going on at all, for a stupid reason all animals on earth became bad looking CGI, and they all hate humans.<br />the kid is horrible but mostly it's the writing and directing of the movie that is the problem. Extras just sit or stand and do nothing until someone talks to them, the writing is just horrible and generic and lame<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan should stop making movies, his films are getting worst and worst.<br /><br />Most of the movie is will smith looking like he smoked a lot of weed and his is the only person playing in the movie.<br /><br />I love will, but this movie is crap
B007PFD90G|3.0|It was interesting to read about those tumultuous years from the author’s perspective.  Nonetheless, there were parts that were simply tedious. I also had trouble getting past some of his reported behavior – his affairs, his sense of entitlement and condescension towards his wives and girlfriends. All this, despite his proclamations of being a defender of women’s rights, were a bit much.
B00EVN3JNM|5.0|It's a very cool movie, it's one if my favorite movies so far! Everyone needs to see this movie for sure!
B003K07DUC|4.0|I love Matt Damon and would watch most anything that he is in.  The movie was good. Would recommend with a little reservation.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you think of yourself as someone who is introverted; or if you love someone who's quiet tendancies often perplex and annoy you, then this book is for you. There is a lot of science to back up the theories and some good old fashioned anecdotes which really personalized it for me.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great chemistry between the main characters.  Somewhat weak overarching plot, but it's a fun, exciting, fast paced show to pass the time!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Although this is a wrong purchase but i have to say this is so cute! I love it. haha. Oh I need one more word.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|love this series and Gabriel Macht is great eye candy Good plots and interesting characters lots of fun to watch
B00ENYKBD0|1.0|it  didn't work.  the reception was so poor, I  couldn't watch it.  for every 2  minutes of movie,  the was five minutes of buffering. it  was a  total waste of money.
B00ESY827C|5.0|My favorite book.  I have read it numerous times.  Seen every movie version.  Love this one the best.  If you never read the book (I hope you will) this movie gives you a great insight into the time period and Fitzgerald himself.
B00EY8ARYS|3.0|Old fans of \\"Smallville\\" will notice parallels immediately. If you liked that, you'll probably enjoy this. One hopes for an occasional cameo by major Marvel characters. In the meantime, see minor characters flirt, make brash mistakes, show off new toys, and pander to Agent Coulson in their race to see who is the most eager beaver. What super-soldier subplot will be picked up around the S.H.I.E.L.D. water cooler this week? Stay tuned!
B005544V6A|5.0|Since I don't get HBO never heard of this series but love the characters and the plot and Gabriel Macht
B00D41H2PS|5.0|It took me quite a while to solve this one the first time through and it was complex enough to still be quite a challenge on the second and third times I played it. There are several &#34;scenes&#34; from stores to rooms in the doctor's house and more to work through. Even making notes while playing it only makes it slightly easier. I thoroughly enjoy this kind of challenging game.
B00F91G5BS|3.0|The potential was there, but I think they defanged it when they decided to go for a happy ending. Suspension of belief is a given with zombie flicks and while the &#34;camouflage&#34; solution was a new twist, it was a bit more of a cognitive leap than I was able to make. Good CGI though.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|I really don't get this game it was really boring and too easy I deleted it within a few days of purchase
B00F35BV64|5.0|Well written and well directed. The character Khan actually drives the movie. Interested in more story lines involving the<br />crew of the Enterprise.
B00BSW6F26|5.0|I have played this game through several times. There is enough detail and enough clues to be found that you will have to work pretty hard to go through it even if you have played it 3 or 4 times.I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the best free games out there. My 2 year old loves it as much as I do and can play it to a certain point.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's not exactly up my alley, with me being a fantasy fan with magick, swords, dragons..<br />But it kept me turning the pages, it's fast, action packed, mysterious, with characters you feel for, well written...<br />A burst my bubble kind of a thing, anyway 5 stars, highly recommended.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it was good until its latest update,now i cant watch practically Anything,it runs like a virus, save yourself the trouble and frustration...just don't get it
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that is syncs to my kindle so no matter where I am I have my book with me as I often don't carry my Kindle but I always have my phone.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|A good follow up - of course James needs to brush on vocabulary but for a book of this nature one shouldn't expect much.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I read the reviews and saw the retings and decided to give it a shot... It blow me away!<br />I can say this, all the people are right and now I am one of them, giving this book 5 stars.<br />I Love the book and can't wait for the story to continue.
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|Wanted to watch the Chronicles of Riddick and this was the first of the trilogy. Vin Diesel played his character perfectly! Looking forward to more of him!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Read it for a book club I belong to.  I was laughing through the tears and did not want to put it down.
B0000A33QW|1.0|Wanted the movie for my wife but when we got it I couldn't get it to play. I tried 2 DVD players and also my computer. NADA<br />You would think they would check this stuff before they sell it or ship it. Too much trouble to return.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Disappointed in the end, could have ended three chapters earlier. However loved the story, good details. Just a little long winded.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|Michael Douglas is creepily authentic. Supporting cast all do a fabulous job. Matt Damon is a little too full of hurt naivite but who's to say that isn't how Scott Thorson was? Guess I have to read the book now!<br />I joked about buying this just to see Matt in a Speedo (not to mention nice nude butt shot). It may well have been worth it for those things-the story and acting definitely are. If you're into that kind of thing.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it!  It was one of the very good series I have seen, although at times I would wish certain characters were played differently.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Cool special effects, but I think they tried to make it too believable which put it over the top.<br /><br />Wouldn't rent it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game totally awesome blew my mind I can't believe how awesome holy mommy guacamole<br />Jesus wowed I mean gosh holy wiz
B00004U8H4|3.0|It would have been difficult to recreate the eeriness of the book and I anticipated that. I wasn't looking for more graphic violence, either-the amount of that is more than sufficient.<br />Christian Bale's Bateman is superlative, I'll never be able to picture another actor in this role. And I think the supporting cast do fine with the rather lackluster script.<br />Very little of it provided the unbearable ennui alternating with wide eyed disbelief one felt reading the book. And to me that seemed the whole point of the story.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Liam grew on me as I watched the series.  The main male stars in the first series 'Blood and Sand' are more muscular.  They seemed to have lifted more weight to get the parts.  But I enjoyed this series as well!
B005F2BBLK|5.0|There are jokes for both kids and jokes that kids don't understand and dismiss as you, the adult, gets an additional life in! The visuals and the story are great as are all the various, crazy characters. Hands down my all time favorite animated movie thus far.
B000VBJEEG|2.0|I honestly never watched the movie. Someone asked for this for a gift.<br /><br />Because of the low start count of 2, I personally won't buy this movie for my personal collection, But, that dosen't mean that someone will want it for their collection.<br /><br />This type of movie is out of my league. I prefer the Japanese Anime.<br /><br />Don't let this review stop you from enjoying a wonderful story for everyone.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|The good bye!!! The last concert of Judas Priest in blu ray it's now available for all the fans, check it out!!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I absolutely love The Good Wife! It is an excellent show and has the perfect balance of drama and suspense. It is very clearly written by a liberal, but I enjoy it nonetheless. This season did not disappoint and leaves you dying to see season 4!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|loved loved this book! It really spoke to me! I'm recommending it to friends, family, clients and students. I'm looking forward to putting a group together too!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Really thought provoking read and truly motivating!!! Great recommendations for other books contained too. I look forward to Pam's next installment.
B0033G9NT2|5.0|Exelent edition, if you are a collector you must have it! One of the best album in the metal rock history!!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I decided to begin watching The Good Wife after all of our other current shows had gone on break and there seemed to be nothing on TV. I was immediately hooked! It is a great show! It is a great balance of drama, politics, and a little bit of suspense. I will say it is very clear that the show was written by a liberal, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can I say about The Walking Dead? I absolutely LOVE this show and have gone to extreme lengths to get to watch it considering we don't have cable, let alone AMC. We bought a Roku specifically so we could puchase and watch this show through Amazon Instant Streaming. Best money ever spent!
B00AA03D18|5.0|Beautiful book, I promised to share with friends only if it returns to me. I want to read again and much slower..
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is a thinking man's tough guy and is only getting better with age. I look forward to the next installment in what I hope is a long tale.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This is a pretty good flick that kept me guessing - normally I figure them out. It was enjoyable and fun, not to mention something you can watch with the whole family for the most part.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I love this new line if Star Trek movies. This one is fabulous and leaves an opportunity for another movie featuring Khan.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|My husband and I both read it. This book caused my tough strong man to get tears in his eyes. What an amazing story We have the greatest respect for the &#34;Old Breed&#34;.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|Hard to navigate. Hard to figure out how to message and communicate. Hard to reject an invitation. Hlpe their stock offering is better than their product.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|Cd sounds o.k. I bought it for the falling slowly tune. The rest I can live with or without.<br />I'm not a big fan of the new mellow I'm in touch with my feelings (rock). the one some does<br />have a pretty melody!!!!
031603441X|1.0|I know this book was supposed to be about Keith Richards but, man, that's all it was about. What a shallow egomaniac. Reading about his long, severe history of drug use a book does not make. It really got boring. It's healthy to have a good sense of self esteem, but listening to how great he was/is got to be a real drag. He cured himself of hepatitis c? Is there nothing he can't do? What a vapid, banal character.<br />I did not like this book. I did finish it but the impression left was really negative. Yuck What a total waste of time and money.<br />ps I bought the hard cover.
B005EPFEPM|5.0|When I watched this movie with my daughter and some friends, we just could not believe these cave paintings!  They are so fluid, accurate and represent the animals to the ultimate.  I personally find it humbling that these ancient people (this artist, at least) could express themselves in this way.  There are artists today who don't have this expertise.  These paintings were done thousands of years ago, for heaven's sake!  The cave will never be open to the public, of course, though a theme park is planned nearby with exact replicas of the drawings.  If you are touched by what humans were capable of thousands of years ago, you need to give yourself the pleasure of watching this movie.  This cave will never again be filmed in this manner.  Stringent rules abound and give no leeway, believe me!  So give you and your family the pleasure of peeking back thousands of years ago into the &#34;studio&#34; of this artist with the crooked pinky finger.  He was very determined to express himself, and our family will forever  remember his drawings and the brave journey he made back into those dark expansive caves ... no flashlight included!
B003CH9PTU|5.0|can be interesting to consider it could happen we have been watching the show and look at it as entertaining
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is so fun. My sister's children love the minions and the game is perfect for them. Thank You Camelot for creating this game!
B004RKXHZY|5.0|How absolutely wonderful!!! I adore SP's stories. I really do!! She is definitely one of my favorite YA contemporary authors!!! I always identify with the characters. The experiences. I have nothing bad to say. Nothing bad at all. I'm happy. I feel happy. I feel swoons and good stuff! The good feels!! Thank you SP for writing such great stories!! =^)<br />I loved Anna and the French Kiss. I loved Lola just as much!!! &lt;3
B00E03ULJS|4.0|I love Krewella since the first time I heard Alive and eagerly anticipated the album.  Great tracks!  I would give it 5 stars but I feel a little cheated because this version I bought here on amazon doesn't have the bonus tracks seen elsewhere i.e. Light & Thunder ft. Gareth Emery. and Enjoy the ride (acoustic)<br /><br />Other than that it is an amazing album!
B00368PSN2|4.0|Good story line, action scenes and very good acting on the part of a few well known actors of today and yesterday.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just had a lot of fun figuring it out. It was also challenging and very addictive. Hope to do a lot more floors.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This is a decent interface where you can access your watchlists. A little bit heavy on the suggested watches. Picture is good.
B00D7NWTSI|3.0|I was gonna watch it at my friends place, brought it over opened it for the first time and only bluray and bluray 3D wtf
B005723JSQ|5.0|Just finished reading 'I've Got Your Number,\\" and it's another winner from Sophie Kinsella. It's a fast moving, light and fun story that is well written. The characters are entertaining, and the exchanges between Poppy and Sam are a hoot. I'd recommend this one, as I would recommend all her books. I especially like that this is a stand-alone book that you can enjoy any time.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|First few books in this series are very good. Round no. 4-5 they get a bit far fetched and hence not as captivating.
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|It's a mildly engaging game of block puzzle. Somewhat challenging, but not as fun as say...Tetris. Sorry, just being honest.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|Is there a John Hughes movie out there that doesn't somehow remind us of our own lives?? This movie makes me smile every time I watch it because I can see my own family members in it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great read from Lee Child. Reacher proves again why he's the best action hero out there, smart and to the point
B0051E9INK|4.0|It certainly stands out as an classic and iconic movie, but seems very steeped int he conventions and styles of its day. It's starting to age badly in sections but is still more then worth watching.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I don't care for the sexual scenes but the story is interesting and I like the lead characters. Good and believable acting.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Quality of recording was high.  Great collection of songs for a great price.  This was a pleasant surprise and brought back a lot of memories.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|I am a fan of the first volume so I decided to get the second volume. The tracks with Bela Fleck are worth it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really liked all the characters.  Didn't want to put it down .  Easy read.  Was set in Australia so I found that interesting.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|There is a LOT of back and forth in the Amazon reviews here that amount to the interpretive equivalent of \\"he said / she said\\".  I don't know enough about either Biblical passages or other scholarly works on the Bible to score the arguments concerning the accuracy of Mr Aslan's claims vs source materials, but I can comment on my perception of this book against some of the broader challenges.<br /><br />I found Zealot to be quite an enjoyable read with some odd internal inconsistencies.  At the end of the day, though, I thought the point of view that the historical Jesus differs substantially from the Biblical Jesus was well-defended, and \\"made sense\\".  While Mr Aslan has no time for Paul's flavor of Christianity, he also notes in the book and on his talk show tour that the historic Jesus is a person worth believing in.<br /><br />Two things disappointed me in this work: one which is outside the book's scope (but I still hoped to find), and one that isn't.  1) I'd hoped to see some analysis on Constantine's conversion.  This is outside the scope of the book, but several references are made to it.  I'd hoped to see it because of my second disappointment - reasons for the longevity of Christianity - which other scholars point to Rome's adoption as a state religion as the main reason without indicating why the conversion took place.  2) Mr Aslan gives suggestions for Christianity's longevity, but never comes up with a compelling explanation.  Most of the talking points have precedents in previous prophets & messiahs, e.g., Jesus still had a following after his death (then Mr Aslan points out that John the Baptist and others did, too).  The one reason unique to Jesus is that he performed his miracles/magic for free, but I have a very difficult time accepting that is the basis for 2,000 years of Christianity.  On a similar note, why did Saul of Tarsus convert?  If Christianity's longevity is derived from the broader uptake from the Gentile community, and Paul was the reason for that, was he a shyster (a picture Mr Aslan paints) and simply saw an opportunity?  Maybe these things are simply lost to history.<br /><br />There are many challenges in these reviews that say Mr Aslan has an agenda in this book.  Seeing as \\"agenda\\" is really the same thing as \\"point of view\\" when it comes to publishing, I say if you're going to the effort of writing a book, you'd better have an agenda...  Others say Zealot is not an original, scholarly work, to which I say \\"so what\\".  What I enjoyed about this book is that, even if not original, it is well-written and aggregates others' original scholarly works in a way that I can consume it.  I have no time to dive / interest in diving in to thousands of pages of scholarship on this topic; I am interested in the occasional 300-page summary.  This is what Mr Aslan offers.  Reviewers who advise readers to read the work of a real scholar - \\"like Elaine Pagels,\\" said one reviewer - might be happy to know Ms Pagels' recent book on Revelations draws similar conclusions on the political side of this story.<br /><br />Another challenge is that Mr Aslan picks and chooses his sources - whether scripture or scholarly works.  Similar to the point about having an agenda, I really wouldn't expect otherwise - assuming one's point in writing the book is to broadcast and defend that point of view.  That said, the general pattern I saw was that where the majority of Gospels had Jesus saying/doing something, he gave that due consideration with a nod to historical fact even where he noted it didn't make sense to him.  The later the writing, the less credit Mr Aslan ascribed to a Gospel, frankly, because those writers had their own agenda.  In the notes, Mr Aslan appears to be reasonably even-handed in calling out which scholars' points-of-view he agreed with and which drew contrary conclusions.<br /><br />Now, where I found the book weakest was those places Mr Aslan went on a tear, apparently proclaiming his personal point ofview.  I found these to be less documented than other claims, and held the most internal inconsistencies.  Some examples:<br /><br />a) The story of Jesus being taken before the Sanhedrin is questioned because it took place during the night and before the Sabbath.  This is discounted because the Sanhedrin didn't hold night court, etc.  However, Mr Aslan shows where other established processes are ignored (e.g., the execution of James the Just), so why not here, too?  Also, he argues they didn't like Jesus' popularity, so why wouldn't the Sanhedrin meet at a time when crowds sympathetic to Jesus were unlikely to be around in any numbers?<br /><br />b) Mr Aslan makes a nonsensical argument discounting a contrary claim that the above-mentioned processes weren't in place in the 30s, so the Sanhedrin wouldn't have been bound by them.  He reminds those critics that the writers of Gospels didn't write in the 30s, either, so...  Hmmm...  maybe I'm the only one that argument confuses.  The time of writing - documenting oral tradition? - doesn't discount the existence or non-existence of these processes one iota.  I don't even understand what Mr Aslan's point is here.<br /><br />c) The crucifixion story is questioned in part because of the sign saying Jesus is \\"King of the Jews.\\"  Mr Aslan argues the early Christians wouldn't have called him that, yet later in the book he states the disciples were \\"above all else Jews.\\"  It's also well-documented here that Jesus called for the Laws of Moses to be followed, so a claim that Jesus wouldn't be considered \\"King of the Jews\\" by his followers contradicts many of the points Mr Aslan bases his arguments on.<br /><br />d) Mr Aslan dismisses 500 Roman soldiers accompanying Paul to Caesarea as absurd, \\"and can be flatly ignored.\\"  This type of argument just irritates me.  Did Roman soldiers never travel in large numbers to a port city?  Is it not possible Paul traveled to the same port city at the same time as these soldiers?  Might a chronicler not have linked the two under the auspices of artistic (or political) license?  To flatly ignore something as was done here is lazy - I'd rather Mr Aslan dismissed the story because there is no indication in the historical record that any soldiers accompanied Paul; acknowledged the possibility but dismissed it as coincidental; or just omitted the claim from his book.<br /><br />Perhaps Zealot is not an original piece of scholarship, but it makes others' original scholarship accessible in a well-written form.  I found this book, internal inconsistencies aside, to be enjoyable and educational.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Horrible handling. Te game has potential, but it's very difficult to steer. Maybe someone should come up with a joystick adapter?
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Book Rating:5<br />Panty Changing Rating: 5<br /><br />Good LAWRD. I am wasted today. Completely worn out. I blame BB for recommending this book. It's all her fault. How am I supposed to work on 5 min of sleep?????????<br />I loved this book. Drew is so GD cute. Shee it. I love his Flu.<br /><br />Anyhoo, to sum up.........I laughed I cried. I barfed and barfed. I had heart palpitations for a couple of hours. And now I'm EXHAUSTED. What a book hangover today. OMIGOSH.<br /><br />I loved this book. Drew is so GD cute. Shee it. I love his Flu.<br /><br />I didn't hear too much about this when I decided to pick this up and give it a go. It was about an arrogant, sexy, bachelor who makes no apologies about his lifestyle. His reaction to his life being thrown into a tailspin by a woman was priceless. The book is told entirely from his POV and it was such a refreshing change. He is soooo hilarious. I swear, I laughed or smiled profusely on nearly every page. I fell in love with him and I'm not sure what that says about me but I'm okay with that. I loved the the female lead as well. She was a perfect match. I will definitely reread.<br /><br />Read the review on Our Blog:<br /><br />http://thebookbosses.blogspot.ca/2013/05/tangled-by-emma-chase.html

B00BATKPBE|4.0|An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins<br /><br />\\"An Appetite for Wonder\\" is an intimate memoir of the childhood and development of iconic scientist and renowned atheist, Richard Dawkins. The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, \\"The Selfish Gene\\".  This enjoyable and  heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters:  Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1,  Under Salisbury's spire,  `And your English summer's done',  The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2,  Dreaming spires,  Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3,  The grammar of behavior,  The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years.<br />2. Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir.  Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book.<br />3. Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins.  A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood.<br />4. Fascinating life.  The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at.  Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. \\"My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.\\"  I'm not going to spoil it...bust rest assured, amusing stories.<br />5. The things that are of interest to Dawkins.  \\"I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.\\"<br />6. The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins.<br />7. Surprisingly forthcoming. \\"I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.\\"<br />8. Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure.  \\"We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was - until my last year at Oundle - anti-intellectual.\\"<br />9. Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. \\"If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?\\"<br />10. The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins.<br />11. Dawkins, Oxford and higher education.  \\"I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.\\"<br />12. It wouldn't be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn't a part of it. \\"He introduced me to, among other things, his - and now my - favourite example of revealingly bad `design' in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\\"<br />13. The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally.<br />14. The most important mentors of Dawkins' life. \\"The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life - and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.\\"<br />15. His surprising love-affair with computers. \\"I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.\\"<br />16. The lectureship in animal behavior.  \\"We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.\\"<br />17. Dawkins' projects. \\"It did, however,feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on `Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology'.\\"<br />18. The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of \\"The Selfish Gene\\".  \\"Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.\\"<br />19. The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make \\"The Selfish Gene\\". \\"So Trivers' name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.\\"<br />20. Links.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.<br />2. The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere.<br />3. I don't know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred.  He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother).<br />4. A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.<br />5. Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.<br />6. Avid fans and readers of Dawkins' books may feel that the book gets repetitive.  Particularly those who have read \\"The Selfish Gene\\".  That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.<br /><br />In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins' life.  This was a very easy and pleasant read.  Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life.  The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of \\"The Selfish Gene\\".  Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading.

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|BOOK RATING: 5<br />PANTY CHANGING RATING: 5<br /><br />I fell in love quickly with book 1.  Right from the first page, I felt, THIS SHOULD BE A MOVIE!  I just love when I \\"see\\" books that clearly in my mind.  Travis is just such a badass.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the effing cafeteria scenes!  Oh, man.  I loved the premise of \\"the bet\\" in the book description.  THAT intrigued the heck outta me, and that is why I bought book 1.<br /><br />When I found out that Book 2 was being written...........from Travis' POV?????  Well, I don't think I've ever been happier, LOL!  I don't know how many times in Book 1, I said, \\"What in the hell is that boy THINKING?\\"  Well, Walking Disaster will answer all your questions.  It was so fantastic.  I honestly did not expect to love Walking Disaster as much as I did.  It was SO not a retelling of BD.  It was a completely different book.<br /><br />Go.  Read these.  You will thank me for it.<br /><br />See review on Our Blog:<br /><br />http://thebookbosses.blogspot.ca/2013/06/beautiful-disaster-series-by-jamie.html
B00ANA27IU|5.0|My friend was going on about how he loved the movie, and I mentioned that the end was too abstract for me. Then he told me about the book - and wow, did it put things together - I will now be able to appreciate the movie more than before!

B00D6DVSAE|1.0|Well folks, I pre-ordered this to my chagrin, thinking to have another great Sting album to listen to. I can honestly say that I will hardly give most of these tracks a second hearing.  If you think you will like Sting puttin' on a dialect and singing in character this album is for you, for me, I was blindsided by it's psuedo-theatricality and extremely broad character stereotypes and lack of a sense of fun.  Where is the sublime subtlety and intellect of his previous albums?  His ability to ask profound questions in a beautiful tenor wail? Where is his sense of humor? Where is the music you get stuck in your head and want to listen to again and again.<br /><br />To be sure, there are a literally a few tracks here, a few too few, that may please Sting fans, but seriously, listen to them individually on ITunes first rather than make assumptions and buy the album based on his past awesomeness.  I hope he works this maudlin guttural ghost out of his system soon..godspeed to whatever this production is so we can get the next \\"Ten Summoner's Tales.\\"

B00915G6MG|5.0|!!!!Arrived on time and in perfect condition!!!! I LOVE this tv show and couldn't be happier with the way it showed up or the condition of the DVD!

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Easy to install, but would prefer more flexibility in controlling TV from phone other than start and stop. Was supposed to get three months free service from Netflix. Entered the codes given to me, but still being charged full price from Netflix. Will give them one more month to correct bill. Besides Netflix, the only other uses for this are U Tube and Google movies. I'm waiting for them to add ability for me to be able to access other programming.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I had never heard of Liane Moriarty when I noticed this book was practically number one on Amazon.<br /><br />I can honestly say it was one of the best book I've ever read. Period. I get bored unless a book is a true page turner (like James Patterson books for example) and I could not put \\"The Husband's Secret\\" down.<br /><br />Then I went and bought two more of her books: \\"What Alice Forgot\\" and \\"The Hypnotist's Love Story.\\" I wanted to see if the first book was just a fluke.<br /><br />Well, I haven't read the Love Story one yet but I just finished \\"What Alice Forgot.\\"  It might even be better than \\"The Husband's Story.\\" ..I'm not sure, but it was AWESOME, too!<br /><br />I'll be buying (or maybe get lucky and borrow one or two from the library) all her books.<br /><br />~ Darlene Today

B00E9PMMX0|5.0|It's amazing, how many fanboys are here! If you want to see the original theatrical releases, George did release the original trilogy in a dvd collection which has both the updated version of the films and the original theatrical releases! I own all three and, when I watch them, I love watching both versions of the films! I do that because I love both versions! I don't care what any of you fanboys say; When this comes out, I'm getting it! I know I won't be wasting my money because I'm a true Star Wars fan! I love all things Star Wars! I love the movies, I love the Clone Wars (and, yes, I like Ahsoka! Deal with it!), I love the video games, I love the comic books & novels, I LOVE IT ALL!!!! I'm not some snot-nosed, small-minded, closed-minded brat who whines whenever things don't go the way I think they should! I know I will get my money's worth because it's Star Wars! So, to all the fanboys, I say this: GET OVER YOURSELVES! BITE ME! and May the Force NOT be with you!

B00C061I3K|1.0|Knowing that so many people shop online now, Daft Punk have decided to bring some of the most bland (and badly performed) elevator style music to your own home now. So you can shop whilst sitting right at your computer and hear digital, digital-age elevator music without even the dizziness or sense of hemmed-in claustrophobia coming from being in a 4 square meter space without windows. Unfortunately, though, that might come anyway without the movement up and down stories, just from this nauseating music.<br /><br />One might guess that the music was also conceived in a 4 square meter space without windows and those strange beings who dress up as robots did research over a year or so in going up and down, whilst writing the music there also, eventually.<br /><br />It's awful.<br /><br />Random is right. That's what you're given by the people whom, once, you could be fairly sure to trust about every segment seeming to be very well chosen by very aware, intelligent, sympathetic, understanding, hard working music producers. Daft Punk never seemed to be the kind of musicians who might be able, for example, to produce a stage or film soundtrack on directions by producers for \\"5 minutes here\\", \\"12 minutes there\\", \\"20 minutes there\\". They had a wise knack of knowing short pieces of music based around short hooks. It's some achievement to be able to make or choose those very hooks and develop a short, concise, apt track around them.<br /><br />This album, whatever you make of it musically, is NOT by any means Electronic Dance Music or, usually much to do with EDM with the odd exception such as parts of (yes, parts of, because everything is a shocking, confounding mess) \\"Gorgio by Moroder\\".<br /><br />I'm not whatsoever reacting particularly to the duo's decision to make music outside of their old EDM, house - club electronic frame of production. Like many others, I'm all for diversity and for being adventurous. I'd agree totally with the spirit that says sticking in the same, weathered club house electronica frame would probably be much worse than doing something new or adventurous. However, it seems that the duo have lost their creative talent, their know-how, whatever the genre.<br /><br />I read recently that they'd tried to make some new club electronica for an album a few years ago, but even they concluded the stuff stank, and it was withdrawn, binned, never published. So, they decided instead to try to learn how to be jazz and psychedelic pop-rock musicians.<br /><br />They don't have a clue, unless that is the point, in keeping with some of the duo's old expressive, conceptual art concepts. These may be seen as \\"Illuminati style unseen controllers ruin musicians all over the world\\" and \\"So, the robots or controlled puppets are unable to manifest as normal humans and make some good, real, living music.\\" And if it is the point to not have a clue, it only means that they really, really don't have a clue about making this kind of music for such a focus is worse than it coming \\"naturally\\". And it sounds it. It really does. It sounds so conceited and framed, staged and effected.<br /><br />OK, these guys aren't stupid it seems, from past evidence. Now they've set out to make a modern jazz - fusion record which would normally be in the smooth soul kind of area, but they throw in vocoders like you'd throw a banging bin-lid into, say, the nicer Spanish style styles of Maurice Ravel, or someone like Miles Davis. Even the machine like vocoder voices sound as if they're doing it against their will, only because they've been made to. That's a very specific thing to do, but the duo seem not to be able to show respect to the meaning and worth of that genre alone, strangely going down serious psychedelic rock and avant-garde 70s pop-rock music-theatre alleyways at the same time. Who would think of mixing up these musical worlds? More than that, they believe it's time to add an old 50s to modern day West Coast USA flavour of music to the alreadyvery odd cauldron.<br /><br />I can't accept that Daft Punk aren't completely aware of that the music clearly sounds framed, staged, conceited, effected, unnatural, highly ridiculous. I think they may have done this deliberately, such is the quite extremist strangeness of their conceptual performance art idea (which is something unrelated to pure musicianship art), and the fetishist strangeness of this album. It's a completely different kind of art. That the music is not good is what is aimed at. Their GQ exclusive interview (still available in the Web) shows the duo tending to try to make clear that novel direness may be exactly the point. They thought people would think it sucks, and while they think it's genuinely, honestly bad to stay in the same creative style rut, they decided to make record which kind of \\"sucks\\".<br /><br />I can't help feeling that this is Daft Punk's attempt to bow out of the spotlight, to go down, perhaps in a huge flash of light. There had to be a perhaps there, for they say they could not predict the reaction to the album. They've said they expected the opposite. I kind of feel sorry for them that so few people have taken their production as what I believe they meant it to be, and so many have taken the awful music at face value, but thinking it is good. I fully respect the duo's right to make any kind of sounds they wish to. I think this is a rebellion statement, against numerous things perhaps, and I believe that the group, of course, know better than anyone that the music of this album, taken as music alone and without further meaning, is nothing to be proud of.<br /><br />(Except, that is, perhaps, in just expressing feelings such as in therapeutic music creative sessions - which I think is very important for anyone to be able to do, also to the general public if desired. But need it be something to set the duo up financially for the next 10 or so high-spending years? The film they decided to release in very limited editions is great, \\"Electroma\\". I love it, it's a landmark piece of cinema, and it ought to be able to be seen without feeling one is sneaking cursory, seemingly under-the-table glances in a low resolution Youtube upload version. This album, though, is one they ought to have kept for a release numbered in very low thousands. I feel strongly about this because it's like we're being told, being force-fed, strongly, that \\"this is modern culture\\", and even, \\"it's good\\". That's the kind of thing that both the media and the modern user-created media communications reality does.)<br /><br />The last big question - flavour of the decade in these conspiracy theory obsessed times (Daft Punk's own obsession also) - is, is this some kind of rather purposefully bad, tongue-in-cheek album merely because of their long term Illuminati style control in music art theme alone? The question is, are the themes and purposes which I find to be behind \\"RAMs\\" purely to be taken as art (\\"Interstellar 5555\\", \\"Electroma\\", \\"Human After All\\" etc.)? Or is there really someone behind them making them act like puppets against their wills, as the stories were to suggest for musicians generally?<br /><br />I'm struck by the staged, absolutely still characters in the \\"Capricorn One\\" evoking Mars video set to \\"Get Lucky\\" who suddenly move on cue near the end, as if the unseen fat controller had just clicked his fingers, or raised their puppet strings. It leads to wondering, of course, and considering they're making so much money out of this, of is, were / are the guys in the control of musicians gang after all? These people make their music on tour right in the middle of a big Illuminati style symbolic pyramid. What's the point? What are they doing? Are they perhaps saying they're put there, unable to choose. Or are they making the statement, hell, look, we just go a little further in our diversions than the other bands who know the handshakes and symbols to get the money and suppress the real creativity out there?<br/><br />Anyway, I think, perhaps it's not so much worth dwelling on when the music alone is that poor. If it were a good album that managed to express similar things, to ask the same questions by a different means, everything would be different. It's a big thing to make inferior music to go into other peoples' sensitive ears kind of on purpose, perhaps behind the cloak of serious art. Still, I'll always feel at least a bit sorry for them that they've somehow felt they had to make this particular album (or maybe, any album at all, anything), and yet, the people can't see it for what it is. Sympathy might be due where the duo discover that most of the fans will love and take as without subtext anything with a sheen, high quality studio recording values (not the Daft Punk original values at all, this) rather than musical values, and a hip marketing crusade.<br /><br />While I know most people will only consider this album as on face value, and will think it is good music (it's not), I suppose there are people who will buy the album for the social significance, the event-like nature of it, the conceptual art identity I've been trying to describe. However, at the end of the day, to me, it's torture, it really is. I've rarely been so annoyed and pecked at and hurt by a piece of music, it feels like a quite sadistic thing. If Daft Punk really are making the conceptual art statements I've suggested here, by in a deadpan fashion making very inferior music, they'd really need to have guns held at their backs by those Illuminati style controllers (in the mould of Dmitri Shostakovich) for me to appreciate this as expressive performance art. While I don't wish that on anyone, of course, I wouldn't bother with the art concept in itself, otherwise. Give my ears and brain a break, please, I'd say.<br /><br />I don't recommend it.

B00BHWG1OO|5.0|I have only watched the DVD at this point but what I saw is terrific. I believe the CD adds 4 additional songs. My wife and I saw Mr. Toussaint at Joe's Pub a number of years ago and we loved it. However, he was not doing the additional narration to Southern Nights that he does on the DVD. That alone is worth the price of admission. The narration explains how the song came about and what was important to him growing up. We were riveted during that segment. The music is timeless and his piano playing is a joy to listen to. Another musical treasure from a master.

If you read or watch a lot of crime tv, true crime or otherwise, you will have the book figured out pretty quickly as it is predictable, which I'm sure the author did not expect.  If you are new to crime then you will enjoy the book for what it is, a twisted tale of some incredibly flawed characters, lots of twists and turns, a real page turner.  But for me...I just wanted to get to the end already, and even for those who liked the book in my club, the end was....a resounding 'not good'.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I resisted going to this movie out of principle because I dislike doing the trendy thing. Vampires, pirates and now zombies. Everything seems to go in waves of popular and then not. This movie wasn't what I was expecting, because it wasn't silly or funny really. I liked the way the characters were written. The kids were slightly annoying, but kid actors usually seem to be really good or really bad. The boy was the best of the kids in the film. The zombies were creepy and crazy looking. I wish they'd told us what disease was used at the end. Other than that was a fun movie.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This follows form with her other books. Compelling story, well written and I couldn't put it down.  Pick it up today.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This item is way over billed.  Yes, it is only $35.  You basically get access to 2 services, Netflix and YouTube (and any other thing you can display via the browser), which provide absolutely horrible picture quality.  I can already get both Netflix and YouTube straight through my Tivo box.  Also, t'he Chromecast iOS app I installed on my iPad to set this up and use it could be one of the least robust apps I have ever seen.  It truly does nothing but tell you what version you are running and what devices are available.  So disappointing.  If you want something like this, go with AppleTV. It is a WAY better deal at $99, even if you don't buy Apple content (it has everything Chromecast has, plus a lot more...HBO Go, Hulu and many others.  I am no Apple fan, believe me, but this product is just not comparable, even for $35.  Pay the extra $65 and get AppleTV (Which also comes with a remote, unlike CC)
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is the movie that all should see in order to get the background of the music of Amazing Grace.
B0089BSM70|4.0|I am happy to report the original title credit with \\"Moustapha Akkad presents\\" has been RESTORED in Collector's Edition Blu-Ray release by Shout! Factory. BOYCOTT the older Universal release!!! This is the one you want to buy: UPC 0 26663﻿ 13520 6.<br /><br />Some initial notes: The disc ships in a very cheaply made all cardboard booklet with no plastic cover, which surely won't hold up to wear and tear. In fact, the back of the cardboard booklet only has the image \\"glued\\" on with 4 pieces of the kind of jelly fastener you find when you get a new credit card in the mail...you can actually remove it. I actually did, and reset it, as mine came shipped with it slapped on pretty crooked. Annoyingly, it's also one of these booklet cases that's about 1/2\\" taller than all your other DVD's, so it won't fit nicely on your shelf (and doesn't even look nice next to the 35th Anniversary Edition of Halloween I, which ships in the standard blu-ray blue case). It also has this cheesy movie art poster (with the visible crease lines intact on the scanned image) on the cover, but interesting includes a reversible cover with the more \\"original\\" pumpkin face artwork and title on the back, from when the movie was released. First thing i did was reverse the cover to look more like the original box/posters when it was released. ;-)<br /><br />Another curious note: The TV version is a DVD, not a Blu-Ray disc, in the Blu-Ray release. I guess they didn't want to spend the extra money to remaster it, since it was shot for TV originally and probably not in high-def in those days anyway. Kind of a cheap shot to do this with no mention of it in the packaging until you open it. Oh well.<br /><br />This is still the only version released yet worth buying, as far as I can tell.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Unstable, can't jump to other books and verses. Apple version is better. All this app does is piss me off
B007IXWKUK|4.0|After reading the first book you immediately want to know what happens next & book two throws you right back into the stormy love affair do Anna & Christian!

B00DJ80VLS|4.0|Dream Theater's eponymously titled 12th album finds the band branching in a slightly new direction while maintaining the balance achieved by A Dramatic Turn of Events between prog-heavy instrumental sections and catchy, arena-oriented choruses. If anything the album is consistent if not spectacular. There are no truly outstanding tracks and no particularly weak tracks. This may sound like a put down but it's actually a testament to the songwriting of a band that could easily dial it in at this point in their career.<br /><br />The individual performances of the band members vary in effectiveness. Rudess is at his best during the radio friendly The Bigger Picture through his use of strings and his piano playing that supports the vocal performance while his all-out chop fest is most appropriately unleashed during the 20+ minute Illumination Theory. Labrie, who I considered a poor fit on Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds and Silver Linings, has benefited greatly from the bands return to more melodic, open arrangements. His voice has matured over the years and he effectively raises the emotional impact of the album through a relatively subdued, thoughtful performance. As the newest songwriting addition to Dream Theater, I can't say I notice any profound impact from Mike Mangini's presence but for what his playing lacks in feel he makes up for in clinical precision and several technically draw-dropping moments.<br /><br />Petrucci is the cornerstone of the band's sound and surprised me with different tones and phrasing approaches (dare I say more restrained?) than I would have expected. As a bass player, I am disappointed by Myung's tone and performance. It lacks meat in the lower end and sounds uninspired. It sounds like he tried to combine the 70's grit of Geddy Lee and the clicky P Bass tone of Steve Harris. The result is a sound that works in places (Illumination Theory) and fails in others. There are several sections where a fretless bass would have added additionalemotional impact.<br /><br />I can't say the addition of an instrumental is particularly exciting for me. DT's music often features instrumental sections that are instrumentals within a song. Enigma Machine is solid but lacks any particularly memorable riffs or solo's that surpass other DT tracks with interposed lyrics. I think their return to the instrumental should have been reserved for something exceptional and, while serviceable, Enigma Machine is not that track.<br /><br />DT's Rush influence features prominently on Dream Theater. In particular, Myung's bass guitar breakdown in Surrender to Reason and the overall song structure and lyrical theme of The Looking Glass (In addition to an opening guitar tone that speaks to Tom Scholtz). Overall, the use of arpeggios and pristine guitar tones are reminiscent of 80's Rush and make me wonder if Petrucci was inspired by Rush's most recent tour that featured a set list heavy on mid-80's era classics (I also caught a Caress of Steel moment in Illumination Theory). None of the derivation takes away from the strength of the album and the sections similar to the aforementioned artists (not to mention vintage prog legends Yes and ELP) are enough to remind you where Dream Theater draws its musical inspiration without insulting their originators.<br /><br />Absolutely love the string section breakdown in Illumination Theory.<br /><br />I am enjoying this album and consider it on par, if not slightly weaker, than A Dramatic Turn of Events. To give Dream Theater's newest album 5 stars would be to say it is on par with Awake, Images and Words, and Scenes from a Memory (which it is not). For a band that has been \\"officially\\" around since the late 80's, Dream Theater would have lost it by now if it was going to go away. I give it 4 stars.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|I thought that this movie was pretty good. it was not as good as the first one but still enjoyable. I thought that the creatures were cool especialy the manaquin monster was cool and Vincent's mother monster. I was glad to see some of the original monsters back like red pyramid and the armless guy those were my two favorite monsters from the first film. the acting was good and I thought that the story was too it was a good conclusion to the series. all in all it was a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B0035S996U|4.0|dubbed but not hard to follow - just have to see the post movie credits and how it relates to today
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book almost as good as Shades of Grey. Very graphic and I learned a lot. CAN'T wait till the next episode.
1476727651|2.0|Works a bit better if you think of it as a fantasy/thriller rather than a horror novel. \\"Doctor Sleep\\" doesn't replicate the structure of \\"The Shining\\" at all. In my opinion, the basic framework of the story is more evocative of \\"The Stand\\" than anything else. There's a group of good guys and another group of bad guys, and they're usually psychically interacting at a distance before their inevitable clash. The story focuses on a different set of bad guys than \\"The Shining.\\" I would think many fans of \\"The Shining\\" might consider the hotel itself to be as much of a character as anyone else. But in \\"Doctor Sleep\\" Overlook ghosts are merely cameos in favor of a fresh group of antagonists, so any reader looking for an Overlook/Jack heavy sequel will be disappointed. There's also a new protagonist too. While Dan Torrance is front and center for the first quarter of the book, he slowly but surely takes on a supporting role in this story.<br /><br />Another change from the basic structure of \\"The Shining\\" is that instead of a claustrophobic feeling, tiny cast of characters, and increasing desperation, it's instead an expansive setting and more characters are progressively drawn into the story as the two sides wage a fairly matched struggle.<br /><br />Definitely bad: Three times the others have to stop and catch the newcomers up on what's been happening so far. Hearing a summary of preceding events makes them seem sillier than they already are. Reading three separate summaries not only feels redundant but goes far to reinforce the feeling of absurdity. It also puts the brakes on any momentum the story was building. They also have to go through the reasoning process about why they're not calling the cops. I know explanations and reasoning is realistic behavior, but this is a story about psychic vampires, man. I suspect that back in the old days, many supporting characters in \\"Doctor Sleep\\" would have been victims; providing us with a scary scene while simultaneously sparingus the need for unnecessary exposition.<br /><br />\\"Doctor Sleep\\" is also very Alcoholics Anonymous heavy. While the young Stephen King would often start books with rock and roll quotes, this one kicks off with not one, not two, but three AA sayings in a row. AA is a big presence all the way through. It's a positive message, very well intended, but unfortunately not that interesting in a thriller in that it doesn't really progress, change, or figure significantly into the plot or the resolution. It's a constant, but static, theme.<br /><br />The plot is convoluted and not very clever either. It's a version of a standard kidnapping or heist story with psychic activity thrown in there with the cell phones and email. Some of the colorful bad guys do entertain intermittently. The way they expire is imaginatively described, and the bad guys do seem to have a light hearted and easy camaraderie with each other which was fun. While the villains could be criticized for being relentlessly (and unrealistically) hip with their jargon, I found them to be ever so slightly more likable and interesting than the protagonists. That said, even the entertaining bad guys rapidly devolve into a repetitive pattern of behavior that makes them a bit boring. They're not really that threatening or scary, either, which is a big minus.<br /><br />While I personally didn't like it very much, \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is not the worst book ever. Many people will genuinely be swept away by the story and action, and that's great. There are some effectively written sections here and there, and King's writing style can occasionally get back into his signature rhythm where reading seems effortless. It just felt a bit convoluted and overall disappointing to me, and I couldn't recommend it with enthusiasm.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I thought that this movie was awesome. I have never played the game  and after watching this movie I do. I guess I'll have to buy the game since you can't rent playstation one games anymore. and I heard that it's one of the scariest games made. the movie was really good and I hope the game is to. I thought that the make-up effects in this movie were awesome and so were the costumes and the acting was great and I liked the story. I hope they kept true to the game. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B000NGTJTY|4.0|A bit long, but the plot twists were interesting. I watched it because of the actors and because of the parallels between the story and the real-life exploits of Whitey Bulger.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Presently I use one notebook for my genealogy findings, one for recipes - if it had been around before I retired would have found constant usage - clip notes (or write notes), tag them, free word association search - excellent!  Have it synced to my phone, computers, tablets - up to date on any device you choose!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The best case ever for the Kindle Fire HD. Its sturdy, doesnt show dirt, and works perfectly! Must buy for sure.
B001BANK32|4.0|As a King fan I had been meaning to read The Shining for a long time; with the release of Doctor Sleep I finally got around to it.  Awesome book, King does a fantastic job of developing the characters and as always, the plot is twisted and unpredictable.  Definitely a must read!
B0074PNCRM|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars, was beyond anything I imagined. The writing in so incredible and it leaves you with so many inspiring messages and brings you to think of the world you’re in differently. It is a book I would seriously recommend for everyone to read. It made me cry, laugh and just experience joy. Definitely worth the read!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book is really charming. It has wonderful and MEMORABLE characters. The book is also touching and very funny. One other note, some of the descriptions of the children's life in the orphanage are deeply disturbing. But all considered, a really good read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love it. Nothing offensive. No bad language.Easy to watch. A joy. Wish there were more series like this to watch.
B00EDX5QRW|5.0|Pre-ordered this album and received it on the release date and played it through upon opening.  The 180gram pressing is really great quality vinyl.  It sounds fantastic and looks good.  The Kings came back with some quality songs that seem to show the growing up they have done since we last heard from them.  More mature songs with deeper content and more thought invested.  It's a little slower and more melodic than some of their previous offerings but I enjoy the change of pace.  It's a great album to actually sit down and listen to as well as to have playing in the background.  There's still a lot of that signature Kings sound with the melancholy guitar work that I really enjoy.  I think there first release, Supersoaker, is about as mainstream radio as it gets on this album.  It's a great song that will probably be a nice transition song for fans of the Only By the Night album.  I'm glad to see the Kings have returned and brought with them some quality work!
B005PK553C|5.0|I love the horror genre and this show is horror at its best. Smart, fast paced and mysterious. Just the way I like it. The best chill bumps I have had in a while.
B0017313I2|4.0|A little slow-moving during the early stages of the film, but things pick up quite rapidly later on. I like the fact the story is not predictable. The acting is good and both Jessica Biel and Julianne Moore make viewing the film even more interesting.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is one of the few apps I use every day for both work and leisure. It's useful in so many ways.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because i liked it, and didn't love it. I thought it was a really good movie over all, and enjoyed how they tied in some of the original star trek.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game every night before I go to bed. It's fun, free, and still has me playing daily after 9 months. Just wish I could finish rooms without the help of friends. Should not have to befriend strangers, or bother my friends to play to earn my room prizes. Other than that, love it!!! Recommend to anyone
B001UTW7QU|4.0|A very thought provoking series. Most unusual, but by the same token, that's what makes it an interesting series. We need more series like this to stir the senses and make us think. What with so many mindless ones out there, this is quite clever.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Quick response and delivery, brand new packaging (as described) and we LOVE these classics!!! Our friends that we are sending a 2nd copy to will absolutely LOVE this movie...
B0098XY5VK|2.0|I loved this game on my computer and I thought I would like it on the kindle but you only get one level with the free version, which means that you are stuck in the Bronx and cannot move on to new venues.  This is a fun game but nowhere did it say that you would only get one level.
0439813786|5.0|My 3 year old kid - dig this book. My 7 year old love this book. This is one of the books that bridged illustration & chapter books. The drawings facinates both children and adult.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am so loving the new direction the characters are going in. As an old &#34;Trekkie&#34;, this treatment of some very familiar figures is interesting and 'logical'.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Really cool app. Would recommend this for anyone who one a fun passing time to play. Love it very much
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It goes on forever.  There is no goal.  It keeps going on forever and when you die you have to start from the beginning each time.
B00E3UN44W|5.0|While perusing the PBS Mystery site I read that Season Three will air in 2014.  You can get a sneek peek. Should we bow our heads in shame at doubting Amazon?
B008JFUO4U|5.0|A lot of people don't care for science fiction, seems silly and unbelievable but, think of the drones in our era, and you can see in this movie, one possible future of warfare.
B0042816YK|5.0|i choose this rating it was so much like my life emty and hollow it did give me hope of a better life and i am working on it sarting by devorsing my husband and move on from there it is a must see that will give hope to anyone that feels there is none
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Once I start playing I cant stop.  I can spend the entire evening playing if I'm not careful.  Gets me in trouble.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Great movie although some early leaks<br />Robbed some of the surprise.  These alternate reality stories are always interesting as they attempt to link together the different storyline and versions of the star trek experience.
0804148937|3.0|This may be my least favorite Grisham book.  It is not that bad, but not as fun to read as the several others of his I've read.  The story is about a wrongly-convicted man who devises a way out of prison.  I sort of lost interest half way through but decided to finish.
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|I made several attempts to install this app on a Kindle HD, it would not accept my Facebook account or allow me to create an account. The app would freeze and I had to reboot my Kindle every time. POS!
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|I highly recommend this to any SciFi fan. Good acting, great special effects. I enjoyed it very much and had fun waching
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fantastic!  Could not put it down and did no want it to end.  Can not wait for the movie to come out.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This is a great movie. Very funny and action packed.  Great combination of characters. Would recommend this movie to anyone.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|(I am a female) I liked this movie a lot! I expected it to try to be very funny all the time, but it did have quite a few serious scenes as well, touching on the themes of the meaning of true love and parenthood. It was fun to see how the characters were connected to each other (my bf called it a &#34;mini Love Actually&#34;). Would watch again.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have used this for several months now. Arma 3, BF3, Bioshock and many others!<br /><br />You simply cannot find another gaming mouse out there with this level of customization or quality.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series!!! Sylvia Day is a excellent author. I would definitely recommend this series and I have! Her other bioks are excellent also
B00846REIS|5.0|If you read and liked 50 Shades this is even better. I wish they would turn this series into a movie. LOVED LOVED LOVED all 3 in this series and have read them twice and may read for a third!!
B00BB8VSXS|5.0|Even though it had English sub-titles it was a funny, heart warming, movie. It shows what a Father and a husband will do for his family. Loved it, I give this movie six stars if I could.
125000098X|4.0|The saga of the Clifton and Barrington clans resumes in this novel, just after World War II.  It opens with the controversy on just who should win the Barrington title and fortune. A tie vote in the House of Lords is broken by the Lord Chancellor's vote in favor of Giles Barrington, while Harry Clifton is left to marry Emma Barrington.  Between Giles and Emma, they own 22 per cent of the Barrington shipping line.  Harry goes on to become a successful mystery novelist.<br /><br />Politics, of course, plays an important part in the plot, with Giles having to run for reelection after previously squeaking by with a handful of votes.  Of course, as the author is a former member of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the subject should dominate his prose, and does.  The chronicle continues to reflect the development of the next generation in the form of the Clifton's teenage son, Sebastian, laying the groundwork for the next book in the series, with a cliffhanger ending.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Mr. Archer writes novels with fully developed characters and plot twists to keep the reader turning pages.  Introducing some dangerous situations, and characters such as the Lady Virginia, to who Giles is briefly married, can strain one's credulity.  However, he probably can be forgiven because it usually sets the stage for some ensuing action or incident further on, and the book is recommended.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This product is amazing...I play it day and night if you want a dragon game that replaces the old one this is the one to come to.... I hope this is helpful to you
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great story even though it's about a younger couple. Sky and Holder's story is very moving and intense at times. Check it out it's worth it!!
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|My son thought this game was pretty cool.  I like the sounds and the bright colors.  I entertained myself a little too.  It can get boring if you play it a lot.  Over all good.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful characters and plot line. It was a fast read because I couldn't put it down! It was a very enjoyable book.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Well, the app looked good... When suddenly, porn ads! &quot;OK&quot; I think. &quot;I'm a grown guy. I can deal with that.&quot; Then, when I tried to navigate the app, things got really confusing. I felt like a member of the Donner party; just wandering in circles. When suddenly, success! I had gotten a song! The problem? I couldn't listen to the little rascal. 30 minutes and many blasphemies later, I succumbed to exhaustion and deleted the app... The end.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked the 50 Shades of Grey series you will love this series. These books are better the 50 Shades and I wish they would make a movie on these. MUST READ!!
1476727651|5.0|I have read so many books by Stephen King and loved them all. His stories are so fascinating and always keep you engrossed in them. I never expected to see a sequel to The Shining&#34;, but I am certainly glad to be reading it.  As long as he keeps writing, I will keep reading!
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|I have been very much disappointed with both Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds... ... so when ADToE came out, I've attributed the comeback of melody and originality to Portnoy's departure. However, it seems it was just a temporary comeback -- DT, while still is very consistent in technique, had become very inconsistent in their songwriting. This time it was fulfilling Roadrunner obligations without too many new and interesting ideas.<br /><br />I think 'boring' would describe this album the best. It lack melody, it lacks the 'progressive' of progressive metal. Most of the songs lack direction, and the \\"epic\\" final track is plain anticlimactic. It wanders aimlessly for 22 minutes -- in sharp contrast to gems like Stream of Consciousness or Change of Seasons. And this applies to pretty much every track, with the exception of maybe The Enemy Inside, which can be billed as a successful attempt at radio-friendly track. While BCaSL was still interesting melodically, if not lyrically, the new album leaves a lot to be desired in both departments.<br /><br />So, it's back to the old and classic DT albums for me. Hope next album yields something as passionate and exciting as Train of Thought, or Scenes from the Memory, or Six Degrees .... this one just doesn't cut it.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This is the best movie ever. Best acting, best cinematography, best lighting, best script, and by far the most innovative work of brilliance ever put to film. Best director ever and his best work: Stanley Kubrick. Simply put: this is the best film ever made.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Good book. It's a very moving story. Sad but seems to be a pretty believable story unfortunately. Worth checking out.
B00BXDOSXS|2.0|Still figuring it out lol if i get it to where its working properly i will certainly come back and give it a higher rating
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|Mix of songs with some excellent singers.  Listened to it about 10 times already and like every song on the album.
B00FF56IR4|4.0|I think that the first episode of \\"Agents of SHIELD\\" is pretty good for a pilot! There are a few wrinkles and a few minor errors, but overall the premise seems good and the actors all seem pretty well cast.<br /><br />The show is a bit cheesy, and they do hit a few tropes a little too hard, but that's to be expected from Joss Whedon, and if you're a Buffy fan you may actually enjoy some of the schlocky stuff. In any event, it's not deal-breaking, just a bit corny here and there. I think once they smooth off some rough edges this will be a fun show!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Good book!! I wish there were more books after this one. I could keep reading on about their love story.
B0000844I8|5.0|Why travel any other way? This film opened a whole new science fiction genre and let the imagination soar. James Spader is Great.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good read. I would recommend this book.  It was captivating and easy to read on my Kindle Paperwhite.  Difficult to put down
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Really, this book is so thought provoking, so beautifully written. It helps us think about those who are different, and those who suffer for being different or with physical difficulties, without being preachy and that is no small accomplishment.<br /><br />My only tiny, tiny quibble is that the kinds of things that these kids say and do, in many instances, do not sound like 5th graders to me. At least not the 5th graders I know (and I have one in my own family right now). They sound much older...at least 8th grade. Dating?? Going out??? I really, really hope most families of 5th graders are not having their kids dating. That's bizarre.<br /><br />But...if you can get past that (and it's not hard, because it is a great book), you will love this book. I read it out loud to our family, including our kids ages 10 (the 5th grader), 14 (8th grade) and 16 (junior in HS). They *all* loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is a player for Netflix and Youtube, and that is all I could get it to do.  I already use my Roku for that (and so much more), so this was useless for me.<br /><br />I thought it would show anything from Google Chrome on my TV.  I could not get it to show anything that was not Youtube.  I only tested it on Youtube, as I currently don't have Netflix.<br /><br />A useless device, just get a roku instead and save yourself some trouble.  The Roku is more expensive, but worth the price.<br /><br />Very disappointed.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My husband loves this game and so does my grandson.  I've never played it but I enjoy the music anyway.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Picked this book for a book club and everyone really thought it was a very good book and it promoted some interesting discussion about parenting and nature vs nurture in determining our children's choices both good and bad.
0385537816|5.0|While this series is very graphic and still love the relationships of the main character and how it all comes together.
B001B6EAOY|5.0|used this with a 2gb and 4gb micro sd card to work with my psp, i formatted each memory card before putting them in the adapter, so it should work for you too
B00ET9T2WK|3.0|This is pretty good it has a good story line and neat battles and characters but it freezes often which makes it hard to play. Also my device has a bug where I whenever I try to get to my army section it turns off, same with communicating with friends. This is not worth 5 stars until the glitches are fixed
B0038NN3B4|5.0|This book will teach you all the ins and outs in order for you to successfully achieve the atkins lifestyle.
B00AC8ZJ6K|3.0|Actors are good, but plot is very slow in the beginning and it is hard to understand the direction of it.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book drew me in. It truly is a compelling story of one of the largest characters in all of our lives. I highly recommend it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I have two of these because we are both an Android and Apple user family. I have used many of their other products and love them. No problems with the units themselves and they charge faster than other brands I have had before.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|The creators of angry birds have done it again. ABSW2 is as addiciting as the 1st with more characters and more fun.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is so good!  An easy read and I can't wait for the movie to come out!  I hope they can do the book justice.
B00ADQPB50|1.0|American Horror Story Asylum abuses and insults Catholicism and Our Lady.  I never buy this stink videos.  I do not give one star but it requires me to mark one star...stink!!!  Boycott this video for insulting Catholicism.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a fun game and the graphics are great.  enjoy training and feeding and just having fun. great game.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|Really Fun game. Would recommend for all ages. My son loves playing it helps to occupy times of long waits.
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|I won't bore you with all the details about my love for DT...lifelong fan since '93, seen them live 5X, have all their concert DVD's, etc.  DT12 (this is what I call it) is just OK.  The songs have really strong melodies and of course the musicianship is outstanding.  Let me start with what I do like...The Looking Glass and Surrender to Reason are 2 really nice and compact prog rock tunes in a very 'Rush' like vein.  These 2 songs make the album for me.  Other songs such as The Bigger Picture & Behind the Veil are strong but not as captivating.  This makes 4 out of 9 songs that I feel are good/great; the other 5 I do not care for much.  Here are some of my main gripes of the other songs:<br /><br />- False Awakening Suite...written to be intended as a concert opening piece.  I see how it works well in that context but as a piece of music to open the album it gets old quick and is an instant skip for me.<br />- The Enemy Inside...good riff but a little too predictable and a cheesy keyboard instrumental section.  More of a main stream song that is just sort of blah.<br />- Enigma machine...cool main riff that grooves but the song gets bogged down by bursts of guitar/keyboard noodling here and there, and the typical guitar/keyboard solo trade-off section.<br />- Along for the Ride...bad cliche 6/8 ballad with even worse keyboard solo.<br />- Illumination Theory...a collection of some riffs, sound effects, and a orchestral movement with nothing really cohesive tying them together.<br /><br />For some reason DT has got in the rut of making a lot of their music over thematic/dramatic, like it is part of some big rock opera.  They also have stopped leaving space in a lot of songs and feel the need to add technical embellishments at every turn.  Also, the production is compressed to high heaven and the drums are mixed incredibly poorly.  Gone are the days where a DT release would surprise me with something new and innovative in their music.  Now I just think they try to push the envelope technically and get as much thematic presence in their songs as possible.  This leads me to believe the use of an outside producer would benefit them greatly.<br /><br />Overall I would say this album as a whole is a step back from ADTOE, however I do really like a couple songs.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|One of the best show ever!!!!!!! Very addicting to watch and interesting characters that keep surprising you. Will keep watching in the future.
B0000844IT|5.0|Exactly what I expected :) It's wonderful. Thanks man. You described it just as I thought it would be. Another satisfied costomer :)
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I learned some very helpful tips about eating @ a restaurant, such as what days are best to order fish, what seafood not to EVER order, & to not ever go out for brunch. He came off a little snobbish & I don't care if he says it's delicious, I will NEVER eat tripe, brains, or oxtail, & I had to look up A LOT of the dishes he talked about. I did enjoy his stories of his past wrong-doings, mistakes, & small triumphs. Overall a good read.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This is a good game. Its interesting, well designed, and thought provoking. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a good puzzle game.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Recommend! This is a great movie with a good message and great scenery! Love the way it's all put together.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like that I can search for an ebay item on my kindle fire now. It does the job and I am pleased with it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I like everything about it.  The color and the protection it provides my Kindle Fire.  Glad I found it.  Thanks!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great story line and a super fast read. The entire series is good and is worth taking a look at. If you are like me and are always trying to find the next great book series, this one is it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I wish I would have known of this app sooner. I love it and it works wonderful. I am waking up to music that I love.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I still love the batman (christian bale) movies better but this was just one great movie. I can't wait till the second one comes out.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|if u rate this game below 5 U SUCK! this is the best kendle game ever. love it from the start.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Love the movie and it was as shown. I haven't actually watched this copy but I have seen the movie before so....
B004FYZJYE|3.0|Interesting story, perhaps the last of Kurt Wallander. Really did not like the ending,<br />although the story was pretty good. First in the series I had read, although I had seen the<br />television series.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This works great! I selected my on type of alarm noise and was able to program the time and days I wanted so that I did not have to remember to set alarm every night! Would recommend to everyone!
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|Short and simple, this is not a groundbreaking gamechanger. It's just another Drake album. You may joke as much as you want about his personality, but somehow you still enjoy it. You're beating your head to the backwards sped up Whitney Houston sample on the hard hitting Tuscan Leather, cruising to Hold On, We're Going Home and singing along, From Time and Too Much got you in your deepest thoughts...... These are the thing that a Drake project is known for and he gave you guys what you wanted regardless if the most of the album is a bunch of \\"album fillers\\" that most are (in a unique way) listenable as a album. This is the Drake we all know and love. Its All The Same.<br /><br />3.8 out of 5
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like the way it makes you use your mind.<br />You really have to think. Something people<br /> don&#34;t do much of anymore.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|This move was phenomenal in the way it drew you in to the story. Excellent visual effects as well as great characters and story
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's very realistic. between the feeding and giving love. the app runs very smooth. no glitches. I will plau this game for a while.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|Just played this app for a few hours. Very addicting! There are so many different hidden object modes, but also combined with other minigames and a nice storyline.<br />I think I will play this game a lot more in the next few days.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have been consistently impressed with Hosseini's writing and storytelling. Somehow, he makes a story about a place that's so far away from me, feel like my own life. His character development, and insight leads to characters that feel real, alive, with flaws and strengths. Just brilliant
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|one my favorite games, I love the mom and baby minions.  the minion beach is a fun addition. would recommend to anyone and have. Love this game so much.
B006LXQID8|5.0|These endearing characters will make you smile and the sweet story will linger with you! Audrey is alluring and captivating as the oddball, do-gooder heroine.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The zombie fad is almost gone but this show is riveting. You will not be able to sit still while watching it. It is so shocking and full of suspense. BUY THIS! BUY ALL THE SEASONS! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I finally finished this book.  A story that takes you through many lives. I love the style of writing and the depth as well.
B008X8RSTM|4.0|The first time I used this product I was very impressed with the detail these maps. I wish I  could get them for my PC.
B003QSOE0U|5.0|If you have never seen this movie it will become a staple. It is a great love story intertwined in a devastating piece of American history. It is great. If you rent it you should just buy it b/c you will forever go back and watch it over. Each time you watch this movie it gets better.
B00C9QQBA6|4.0|I bought this because the concept looked cool - long-lived aliens undercover, influencing human history. For 99c, it's definitely better than the in-flight magazine for some light reading. It's also very short - too short, I'd say.<br /><br />I believe it's intentional - this book provides a tantalising taste of the rest of the series.<br /><br />Now, while the story is certainly tempting, there are two things in this story that make it only four and not five stars.<br /><br />First is the fact that it's light on detail - you get very little description of the characters' thoughts before acting and there's very little description of anything bar the characters' appearance. I guess that's more my personal preference - I don't care if she has beautiful, long blonde hair or if she's bald, but I would like to know more of what she's thinking beneath that scalp. It'd help me relate to Emily better.<br /><br />Second is that some of the language seems a little too modern, which makes the narrative a bit jarring, particularly when modern language is interspersed with some of what I imagine to be more like the time period it's set in.<br /><br />Once I managed to suspend my disbelief on those two matters, the story definitely hooked me. I believe the rest of the series might go on my Christmas list...
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I love this game. This game is cool. What stinks is that you can only see your person from angle.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This app is great. It gives more than most free downloads. I have not installed the updates however b/c the permissions make me nervous. It requests to take pictures from your phone which I don't understand at all. But it is fun. You can create a lot!
B004856SQ8|5.0|Great Movie, my boys and I enjoyed watching it over and over and over again. Hope they come out with A-Team part 2
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|This set includes all five movies, all the special features ever created for the movies, and two hours of new content. I hope to buy this set, because I have been holding out for the set, rather than buying each movie individually, but there isn't *that* much new content. I'm sure the new content will show up on YouTube, but I'm looking forward to having the set in any case.<br /><br />Here is the list, with the first four items being the new content:<br /><br />BLU-RAY & DVD SPECIAL FEATURES<br />* Twilight ALL-NEW special features<br />o Cast Retrospective with New Interviews<br />o \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Character\\" - Previously unreleased behind-the-scenes moments with the cast<br />o \\"Twilight FAN-omenon\\" featurette<br />o \\"Twilight Forever: Edward's Saga\\" and \\"Twilight Forever: Jacob's Saga\\" - Highlights of Edward and Jacob's stories in the epic story<br />* Twilight feature film and special features<br />o \\"The Adventure Begins: The Journey from Page to Screen\\" - a 7-Part Documentary (PIP available Blu-ray only)<br />o Extended and Deleted Scenes with Director's Introduction<br />o Audio commentary with director Catherine Hardwicke and actors Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart<br />o Music videos from Muse, Paramore and Linkin Park<br />o \\"The Comic-Con Phenomenon\\" featurette<br />o Cast interviews with Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Cam Gigandet, Edi Gathegi and Rachelle Lefevre<br />o Premiere Red Carpet Footage with Cast Interviews<br />o A Conversation with Stephenie Meyer<br />o \\"Becoming Edward\\" featurette<br />o \\"Becoming Bella\\" featurette<br />o \\"Music: The Heartbeat of Twilight\\" featurette<br />o Vampire Kiss Montage<br />o Bella's Lullaby Remix<br />o Edward's Piano Concert<br />* The Twilight Saga: New Moon feature film and special features<br />o 6-Part Documentary<br />o Audio commentary with director Chris Weitz and editor Peter Lambert<br />o Deleted and Extended Scenes<br />o \\"The Beat Goes On: The Music of The Twilight Saga: New Moon\\" featurette<br />o \\"Team Edward vs. Team Jacob: The Ultimate Love Triangle\\" featurette<br />o \\"Introducing the Wolf Pack\\" featurette<br />o \\"Becoming Jacob\\" featurette<br />o \\"Edward Goes to Italy\\" featurette<br />o \\"Jump To Edward\\" and \\"Jump To Jacob\\" features<br />o \\"Frame by Frame: Storyboards to Screen\\" featurette<br />o Music videos from Death Cab for Cutie, Anya Marina and Mutemath<br />o Behind-the-scenes Rehearsal with Muse<br />o \\"Fandimonium\\" featurette<br />o Exclusive Webcast Event footage<br />o Premiere Red Carpet Footage with Cast Interviews<br />o Extended Cast Interviews with Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner, Chris Weitz, the Cullen Family, the Wolf Pack and the Volturi<br />* The Twilight Saga: Eclipse feature film and special features<br />o The Making Of (6-Part Documentary) (PIP available Blu-ray only)<br />o Audio commentary with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart<br />o Audio commentary with Stephenie Meyer and Wyck Godfrey<br />o Deleted and Extended Scenes<br />o Music Videos from Muse and Metric<br />o \\"Jump To Edward\\" and \\"Jump To Jacob\\" features<br />o Photo Gallery<br />* The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 Theatrical Version and Extended Version and special features<br />o Includes Theatrical and Extended Versions of the film and the extended version has 8 minutes of footage not seen in theaters<br />o \\"Love, Death, Birth: Filming The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1\\" a 6-Part Documentary (PIP available Blu-ray only)<br />o \\"Jacob's Destiny\\" featurette<br />o Bella and Edward's Personal Wedding Video<br />o \\"Jump To Edward\\" and \\"Jump To Jacob\\" features<br />o Music Videos from Bruno Mars, Christina Perri, The Belle Brigade and Iron & Wine<br />o Audio commentary with director Bill Condon<br />* The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 feature film and special features<br />o \\"Forever: Filming Breaking Dawn - Part 2\\" - 7-Part Making Of documentary<br />o \\"Two Movies at Once\\" featurette<br />o Audio commentary with director Bill Condon<br />o Red carpet footage<br />o Music Video from Green Day<br />o \\"Tingles & Chills: Special Vampire Powers\\" featurette<br />o \\"Carlisle's Contacts: The New Vampires\\" featurette<br />o \\"Judge, Jury & Executioner: Aro & the Volturi\\" featurette<br />o \\"Being Charlie Swan\\" featurette<br />o The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 at Comic Con<br />o Stars on the Black Carpet
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Love playlist mode. I love that I can watch all my favorite videos without having to search for them all the time. I just click my playlist and off I go
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is simple looking and easy to use effectively with no clutter. Perfect calculator app for your kindle fire and for all ages.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I laughed, I cried, but best of all--Altucher's emo style made me think and think hard.  Bravo for a great book!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have really enjoyed wasting my time away playing this game special rooms are great play the tournament's as much as I can
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A good read if you like development of characters. I love all of this author's books -- a great storyteller!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Chimpact is a fun game with a strategic element to it.  It reminds me of the Mario Bros games for Nintendo.  I think that Chimpact is a good game for children.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|Very beautiful music! Ludovico is a true talant, 5 stars! Love it! Good catch for good price! Enjoyed the product a lot! Recommend to others!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|It's OK. The author portrays himself as a historian... but there is a lot lacking. Not painful to read, just left me wondering why I read it.
B003VANOFY|2.0|The headphones were great while they lasted. But after just a year, the battery does really quickly and the ear pieces fake leather have all fallen apart. It's only been a year and I need to buy new headphones...Not the quality that I expect from Logitec
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|I ordered the game,  and got confirmation, but the game has not made it to my Kindle yet. I will update my review when I get to play it.
B002E9PXYS|5.0|This book unlocks the power of our minds to control our destiny and create a truly wonderful future that is happy and abundant. A must read!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|It's another book of Michael Connelly that moves along and keeps the reader interested to the very end.  I will keep reading this author.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|To anonymous I stared playing this game a month ago and I try to log in the other day it took a week to log in in whean I finally did all my skill slots wer gone its a cool game for a while but it's got its glitches maybe u can figure it out the
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this Kindle Fire, with HD! It's &#34;User Friendly&#34; and I would highly recommend it as a &#34;starter tablet&#34;! WiFi signal wasn't the greatest, kinda slow and that slowed the system down...Overall, I gave it 5 stars!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Loved the book, made you feel like you were right there in the moment with the characters.<br /><br />Great writing, would recommend highly to anyone.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoy this book just wish their daughter didn't have to suffer the sins of her father she was so smart with a full life.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|After finally getting around to reading this book I have to say I did enjoy it.  There were a lot of similiarities to Harry Potter and even Twilight.  It's kind of both of those stories rolled into one.  You have magic, immortal beings, vampires, warlocks and demons.  There are battles and love triangles.<br /><br />I do have to admit the story was a bit slow going at first and was a bit difficult to keep the characters straight.  Once I got almost 1/2 way through it started picking up and became a lot more interesting.<br /><br />I know I made comparisons to Harry and Twilight and that isn't very fair to the author.  Even though there are similiarities there are enough differences to make the story stand on it's own.  I'm looking forward to reading the series.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Dexter is a very good series. It is shotimes best series. Just horrible it had to end. I think it is safe to say that we will miss dexter.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|Fun, fun, fun.  If you like hidden object games, this series is one to check out.  The graphics are good and the puzzles are challenging.  I like the various selections of locating the objects.  It makes the game very addicting.  I've spent many hours playing and have enjoyed every minute!
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Great movie, even my wife liked it! My father in law that it was the best movie he had seen in a long time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This the best game it has awesome levels to play on. If you are going to buy this from amazon then please do. It is awesome :):):):):):)
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I could listen to this album all day - except maybe \\" Kiss with a Fist\\" which is a really scary song...
1250029465|5.0|I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE BOOKS, ONE FOR ME, AND ONE FOR A FRIEND.  ANIMAL LOVERS WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. ANYONE WHO LOVES A LOVELY HEALING STORY OF CARING AND SHARING SHOULD READ THIS.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Even on the first listen the songs gelled with me and I felt I knew the words before I have heard them...the music is pleasing the melodies are great and the words have meaning that will sink in over time...I don't try to listen too hard to a Jack Johnson album, I let it all sink in over time, and feel this one will be filling my ear holes with pictures and scenarios that my brain will want to enjoy for years to come.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Really good acting and story telling. I enjoyed the entire series in the original form. Buy this for its great details.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|I have not watch these DVDS yet, but I did see it when it originally aired....I bought this series because it is not on HBOGO like almost every other noteworthy series they had.
B006DLP6JA|5.0|good price, quality, speed, support for video quality, works perfect with demanding games, and movies, good option in terms of price and quality
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I got this knife mostly for jamming into the skulls of zombies or slicing their heads of with swoop to the neck. With the great grip and the sharp thick blade this should not be a problem.....worried about rush?! If you never put this bad boy down it wont have time to rust!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is obvious why this production has such a following.  Excellent writing and acting and can't wait until Season Four.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book as well as the first one.  Too bad they can't make the movies to meet our expectations.  Wouldn't it have been great if Girl on Fire by Adele could have been the theme song for the first movie.  Oh well, maybe for the next ones.
B00B47NO2O|1.0|I'm not even sure who this dreck is created for -- distracted people with short attention spans who watch while updating their social media status and texting their friends?  It's ridiculous from top to bottom: premise, plot, characters, everything. We bought the entire season, muscled through five episodes, and then just deleted it.  Now I just need to forget that Kevin Bacon ever attached his name to this dog.
B006M4F67A|2.0|I ordered this app because I was curious about Mahjong and I wanted to see how to play it.  After I got the app and used it for awhile I could not understand why the game is so beloved.  I googled \\"How to Play Mahjong\\" and found that this app has no relationship to the real game, The app may use the same tile types but you are not playing Mahjong.  This app is a simple tile matching game. Match tiles on the end of rows, that's it. You win or lose based on selecting the best final pairs to match and luck.  Not much fun at all, IMO.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I'm so happy that viewers ignored the critics and enjoyed the film. I thought it was wonderful in every way: acting, directing, costumes and settings. This movie was not only stylish but poignant and meaningful, complete with a history lesson. Way to go, Madonna and all those connected with it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire and just use the timer and alarm functions. Very simple, easy, and intuitive.  Good value
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I saw where a lot of people were giving bad reviews of this book bc it wasn't the last one but I myself love Gideon and Eva and I'm not quite ready to be finished with their story. So I say thanks Sylvia and keep them coming as long as u feel passionate! Super excited for the next book!!!!!
B00005JN4H|5.0|This is a great comedy.  Good performance by both Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah.<br />Plus, it's family friendly.  Recommended to anyone who loves a good laugh.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|This app is the best app in the app store because you can get free music and in the music app store free music is the 70's, the,80's and what ever else
B00915G6R6|5.0|If you haven't discovered the Good Wife and you enjoy watching brilliant acting, engaging characters, intrigue and court room battles that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then get started on series one right now.  This Fourth Season fulfilled all of our expectations, only two left to watch in this series unfortunately so I hope they have started making Series 5.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Lots of Glam, but  no story. Very boring. I should have known with Dicaprio that the only decent movie he ever appeared in was Titanic.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I am the type of person that never reads manuels and will play with electronics until I learn how to use them. And I have to say this is an extremely simple machine. Easy to get around. I use to have one years back that was way more complicated and cost about $150. Unfourtinately (like most people in this economy) I have to bargain shop, cause I'm not made of money. This was one of the cheaper interfaces I found but I could not be happier with it. I love that it will accept a normal and computer microphone, very nifty. I run this with FL Studio 10 Producer  and am able to plug my head phones into the interface as well. If you're looking for cheap and sturdy, you found it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is my favorite keyboard hands down.  I love how it looks and how user friendly it is.  It's my keyboard from now on!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This recent update for the app has very much screwed up the notification part of the app. This is not helpful at all. Twitter should do a survey and ask people what problems they are experiencing not assume it.she fix those problems only.  I had too uninstall and reinstall 4 times. Please think of us your customers instead for once. Hopefully this will help if not I'm not sure Twitter 's app will be used as much any more
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Phenomenal movie!!! Keeps you guessing until the end!!!! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie to go see!!!
B00DGABUIC|5.0|I also overpaid a bit for my Toothless. Because you can find them at Toys R Us, and I've seen them at Walmart for around five dollars. But either way, I love the detail on Toothless. It's a must have for an HTTYD fan.
B00F91G5BS|1.0|I saw this movie at the theater and it was okay. When I heard that they were going to release it in the unrated version, I was expecting to see more gore than the PG-13 rating. Not so. The unrated version you see blood splatter of zombies which made no sense because in some scenes zombie blood is blackish. The stomping of a zombie head was added but not gory. All in all the unrated version is just like the PG-13 version. I suggest that you rent it for less from the box than watching this unrated PG-13 version.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Great writing, as good as any Le Carre,  The plot is tight with characters placed squarely in Her Majestiy's Public Service, where the  author is quite at home. The political setting is current. As ever Le Carre writes no unambiguously happy ending. Just hope, maybe!
0385333846|5.0|There's a reason this novel is so highly regarded by so many. A really quickly, engaging read, will keep you giggling and snickering to yourself as you turn each page. Its a lot of fun, and a real delight to read.
B005KISHDY|4.0|so, I got the starfighter today and have some major complaints. While it had all the pieces, it was already pre-built which took the fun out of it immediately. What's more, it didn't come with any of the figures shown. Very disappointed with this and will definitely NOT go through the same vender I did to get it. Very, VERY disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best Bingo app.  I love this game. It so easy to play and you can use it anywhere
B001JOIEZ4|3.0|I only wanted 3songs off this album and had to buy the CD to get them.  I guess they have'nt made enough money off Twilight yet.
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|I would love to see her live.  I really enjoy this album.  Almost every song is good and that's rare to like the majority of songs in one album.  A definite &#34;Yes!&#34;
B0010HA68I|5.0|I have used these for many hikes including 2 weeks in Patagonia.  I attach them to the camera case and put the waist belt of my back pack through the belt loops of the camera case. No swaying and the camera is easy to access.  Camera bag is also easy to unclip when taking off the backpack, I normally just unclip one side and leave the camera case attached to the backpack.  I've got another set on my neck strap and just connect the neck strap to the camera bag for use without the back pack.  Lastly, I have a wrist strap attached to the camera with the same clips.  I can remove the wrist strap and attach the neck strap to the camera if I want.  I wish I had discovered these sooner,
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is a master at weaving many characters that you love, hate and suspect ino a twisted plot of mystery and romance. This was one of her best writings.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google really got it right with this.  The out of box experience was flawless, and within a few minutes I was streaming YouTube and Netflix content on my television and controlling it from my Nexus 7.  It was one of the few products that I felt compelled to toss away the packaging right away because it was clear that I'd never need it again -- this thing is likely to have a long and productive life attached to the back of the television.<br /><br />Actually, my one nit with the device: the white status LED is far too bright, but it's nothing that a bit of black tape won't fix.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Great movie for a family with boys in it so I can make 16 words in it more so easily
B000KIPT30|5.0|I needed an inexpensive unit to separately control the levels on headphones and monitors in my keyboard studio.  This unit is very compact and very inexpensive.  The only issue I had was when I connected one of the HA400's outputs to the 1/4&#34; inputs on my Mackie powered monitors using a stereo 1/4&#34; to a dual mono 1/4&#34; splitter cable, the sound was distorted.  However, when I switched to a stereo 1/4&#34; to dual RCA splitter cable and connected to the monitors' RCA inputs, the sound was clear. I am not sure why this is so, but for $20 I am not going to ask a lot of questions.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|One of the coolest series of movies ever made, great for the whole family, and can't wait to watch the next one.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|With the exception of Breath away from Heaven, this record rocks.  There are several tracks that you would swear that he wrote while he was still with the Beatles.  This is one record by George Harrison that you must have if you are a fan of the Beatles.  There are even several tracks, not just the obvious, that he wrote for his former bandmates.  Give this record a listen, and you won't want to take it out of your cd player.  Just tap the skip button on Breath away. This record ranks up there with the best of the post-Beatle records that were released by any or all of them.  Even the last track, while it has no credible lyrics, is a good little tune.  I give this five stars in spite of the fact that there is a dud on it.  Everything else totally eclipses it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very good entertaining by good graphics story was awesome can't wait for part 2 take my word if you looking for fun this is it
B000000QFV|5.0|This just might be the best non-ozzy, non-dio Sabbath record.  It's dark, sludgy, with cool classical guitar bridges in every track.  The singing is top notch by Tony Martin.  This is definitely the best record he recorded with Black Sabbath.  The lyrics are mystical, moody, hypnotic and perfect.  The music works as an excellent companion piece to the lyrics that blend in an almost concept album storyline.  Its not exactly a concept album, but it flows very well between the tracks.  If you are looking for a Black Sabbath record that's different and experimental, get this one.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Whether you love music, audio engineering, LA, grunge rock, glam rock, or just about anything having to do with the music industry over the last 45 years, you'll find something to love in this very well-executed documentary. Well done, Dave.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story, excellent characters.  You owe it to yourself to read this!  I read this in one sitting!  action packed.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Lots of actions and some fun, cheesy lines in there.  If you go for the action-type films and grew up with these stars, they still can bring it and entertain!  Definitely worth a look!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I believe it was the pilot episode, Steve and another man were in a prison cell, he knocked down the door with a flying kick. The other prisoner asked, ''how are you able to do this?'' Steve replied, ''vitamins!'' Great series.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This ap is so much fun and easy to use! I can't believe it is free. It is incredibly helpful for learning a language
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book....so many wonderful life lessons.  I believe anything is possible.  I will never look at a dog the same way.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was casually suggested by my brother-in-law one day. Bought it the next day and wow! Great universe that has been created, makes you want to know more about what caused what and why and by whom and.... I digress. Definitely worth every cent!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Not perfect, but suspensful until the end and totally addictive page turner that even a non mystery lover will enjoy.
0425252868|5.0|Sent this someone in prison I know.  Provided inspiration and triggered many memories of the war, taking him away from the daily drudgery of his current life.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Another great Reacher story.<br /><br />Well developed, well told. Lee Child really knows how to create a page turner.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1932735410|5.0|Fast shipment and the book arrived in good condition.  Thanks for the prompt service.  This book is a very good value and a must for those applying for a PMP certification.
B00005K3O0|5.0|Movie has a great cast and is excellent to watch...recommend this film for all movie buffs who like Anthony Hopkins
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|AND I agree, the game is weird. It's not the HO Mystery type I'm used to seeing from this company. The storyline is easy to follow, but the quality I'm used to from G5 which is a top game developer is not there. Overall it's still better than most of the games on the market. It just feels empty next to their previous products.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and never get tired of it!<br />A little eerie though, watch it to see why.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Kept reading this book thinking it would improve. While it does have a surprise ending, I did not enjoy this read.
B00DB624GS|5.0|\\"Then Play On \\" from 1969, was Fleetwood Mac's last album with Peter Green and the first with the young guitarist Danny Kirwan . Both guitarists bloom on this classic album, both as musicians and as songwriters , and one can only fret about Peter Green immediately after the release chose to leave the group . Not least because the group's last single \\" The Green Manalishi \\" , which is also included here as a bonus track , shows that the group was at the forefront of rock music in the late 1960s .<br /><br />In contrast to the group's first two albums Fleetwood Mac on \\"Then Play On\\" allow themselves to spread over a much wider musical spectrum. It seems that Green and Kirwan mutually inspired each other to explore new musical directions .<br /><br />The album has over the years been released in different versions with varying tracklistings . In particular, some releases miss several of Danny Kirwans songs while Peter Green's classic \\" Oh Well\\" was missed in the early editions of the album.<br /><br />This CD release has all songs ever included on any version, and also the very last great single to feature Peter Green, \\" The Green Manalishi \\" / \\" World in Harmony \\". So I won't hesitate to call this the ultimate version of the album .<br /><br />Some might think that the preceding single \\" Man of of the World ,\\" which would have fitted in nicely , should also have been included.<br /><br />Musically, the album ranges far from classic blues to country and folk to progressive rock , spiced with superb guitar playing from the two guitarists Green and Kirwan . The band's third guitarist, Jeremy Spencer , was largely absent during the recordings . Spencer was at this time very eagerly working with 1950s pastiches with humorous connotation.<br /><br />Kirwans songs are for the most part quiet and melodic , sung by himself with his very boyish and not very bluesy voice. Most are very fine , especially \\"Coming Your Way \\" , \\"Although the Sun is Shining\\" , \\"Like Crying \\" and \\" One Sunny Day \\" are numbers setting the mood the album. The latter is derived from an earlier session , and the number shows that Kirwan could also write write blues songs with guts .<br /><br />Most of Peter Green's songs are excellent, and they show a musician / songwriter looking for new frontiers and expression. Green sings his own songs, and it's not only his guitar playing that is missed on the following albums : his lovely soft and smoky voice is always a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />It is difficult, and perhaps unnecessary to emphasize individual songs , since everyone is at a very high level. Besides the classics \\" Oh Well\\" and \\" The Green Manalishi \\" I can , however, especially not resist to bring forward the cool and humorous \\" Rattlesnake Shake \\".<br /><br />Great informative liner notes from David Fricke.e Sunny Day \\" are numbers setting the mood the album.

B005PK56TA|5.0|I loved this.  The people who did the sign on must have also done the one for &#34;True Blood&#34;.  Very interesting line a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and &#34;The 6th Sense&#34; and even &#34;Topper&#34; from many years ago.
B000FC1192|4.0|Sticks pretty close, but some additional oddities make it worth having both the book and the movie.  Coraline is a very inspirational little girl, a bit of a brat - understandable in her situation, but knows right from wrong and acts accordingly.  She is thrown into some very scary situations.  Looks like Neil Gaiman is the new favorite author from reading several of his other books recently.  The Ocean at the End of the Lane is one of the best books I've ever read - hope to see a movie interpretation of that.  Anansi Boys needs reread, I feel like I missed a lot.
B003J4MAAC|5.0|Maybe not the best &#34;Dirty Harry&#34; movie, but it's very,very, good. I have a fast connection and the movie looked good, and sounded great. Amazon instant video really is a good deal, good choices, and if you email them, they actually reply! Good stuff Mr. Bezos, keep it going.
1476733953|5.0|I started off reading this not sure what to expect.  Quickly, I found that I could hardly put it down.  The world that the author has created is incredible, and somehow seems like it could be a very real place.  I will be recommending this to all of my friends.
6305313687|4.0|This movie is great.  It's really intense in parts but also really sweet and honest.  It's not the kind of movie that I can watch all the time, but I think that's because I don't have to.  There are some movies that you can watch a lot because they don't stay with you after you turn it off.  This is not one of those movies.  As far as movies go, this is one that I think about more than almost any other.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I've always admired Grohl as a musician, but now I can add filmmaker to the list. This is, without a doubt, one of the best documentaries on music I've ever seen, and to tie it to a studio and its Neve console was pretty brilliant. The latter half of the movie, giving us a peek at sessions in Grohl's own studio, was magic. And the music was wonderful.
B0000542D2|4.0|I just watched this movie a few years ago.  I didn't know anything about it when I saw it and it became a favorite.  It's ridiculous and funny and it gave me an appreciation for Ringo.  I never even gave him a chance until I saw this movie.  His scenes are by far my favorites.  If you grew up around the time of the Beatles (unlike me) then you'll appreciate this movie for nostalgic reasons that I can't relate to, but if you're younger and a fan of the Beatles (like me) you'll still love this.  I highly recommend watching this with other Beatles fans.  It makes it more fun.
0345803485|1.0|I tried hard to get through the second book hoping the writing improved but it remained the same.  Every time I read &#34;my inner goddess&#34; or &#34;fifty shades&#34; I wanted to throw it in the goodwill box.  The characters are poorly written and unbelievable.  The writing seems to come from a 16 year olds perspective.  I've never read a book where I was sure that I knew the authors own personality.  It was irritating to always have that aspect coming through the writing.  I am now bewildered of why they would choose this disaster to make a movie out of.  Probably industry favors since the author is in the business.  I'll be skipping that along with the rest of the series.  I'm shocked editors let this slide through.  Someone should have corrected what was so obviously bad and maybe it would have at least been readable.  If you want to read an amazing erotica series check out Anne Rice's &#34;beauty series&#34; written under another name.
B000VSBX34|4.0|This movie is amazing.  It's the Monty Python style comedy that just makes you scratch your head and say, &#34;What did I just watch?&#34;  The rest of my family hates this movie but I really like it.  It's fun for me to see these legends in ridiculous situations.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|tôp notch. This is a very good study tool. Very original, smooth flowing functions. I recommend it. Very innovative idea.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Do I really need to say anything about this movie?  If you're a Harry Potter fan, you've already seen this and love it.  My dad is actually not a fan.  He never read the books and doesn't even give the movies a chance.  However, he knows the whole story because my mom, sister, and I are in love with the series.  So, I started watching this movie right after I got it.  He was in the room at the time and he ended up staying for the entire movie because it was that good.  Ten million points for Harry Potter.
B00DQVST76|3.0|I really loved the Sticky And Sweet Tour DVD. To me that was one of the greatest concerts i've ever seen. From beginning to end it was amazing. My problem with MDNA Concert is soo much editing. There has to be a thousand cuts or more in this DVD. Things flashing at you off the screen, I just felt alot of it was just really unnecessary. That's probably why so many are having problems with menu screen and sound quality on blu-ray because they focused so much on editing the show they were liable to screw something up! Sure the sticky and sweet tour was edited heavily but they went way overboard with this one. A concert experience is supposed to be like feeling like you are actually there. But this is edited so much you might as well be watching a music video. It's just cut after cut after cut after cut after cut after cut, switch scene switch scene, stuff flashing at you, scene switch, scene switch, cut, cut, flash, flash, flash, flash, cut, cut... I mean come on! I will watch it a couple times to see if my review will change but as it stands I give it a 3 star... BTW madonna is 55 and i still find her incredibly sexy...
B00003CWL6|3.0|It's a good movie but I regret buying it.  It's a movie that should be studied in film classes and talked about but it's not a movie that I can watch and really enjoy all the time.  Just rent it or borrow it from a friend.
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|I love Wreck-it Ralph (WIR), the movie, great story, great for kids, great for parents, great for everyone!<br />I really don't like the quality of the blueray disk. Is it me or is the quality of the disks seem to be going down... my disk will sometimes pause /freeze;and the only way to get it to play again is to shut off our blueray. It never freezes in the same spot either, so I know that it's not the blueray player. Now we have checked our blueray player, and cleaned it, and tried older dvd disks that are scratched and they work better than the WIR blueray. Now this doesn't happen all the time with WIR, but it's happened just enough for us to wonder if this was a better buy than the 5 disk WIR that we were considering.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|I saw this years ago (long before the Hunger Games was even a book).  It was messed up but in a good way.  The way the video instructor talks about the battle like it's a fun game is just disturbing.  I love that.  If I had seen the Hunger Games first, I probably wouldn't like this movie but since I saw this first, I have the luxury of loving both.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|The first star wars angry birds had a daily reward which this one does not. There were alot more boards in the first one. I was upset to see how short this one is. I wish that there was a tutorial, if you will. I found it difficult to understand at first. As in all the angry birds series this one contained some curve balls. I am not understanding the fact that one week before star wars II came out there was an added board in the original, Battle at endor. Followed by a randomly appearing emperor pig that would appear and reappear for no reason. I am still in the dark about the death star in the first star wars angry birds says coming soon. The sequel took a small amount of time to figure out, in game purchases and the rewards. All in all I anticipated alot more from part II but  it is still exciting to play. I just wasn't pleased as I was with the first one.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I loved this book so much. What this man had gone through is for beyond what any man should endure. He is and will be for the rest of my life. When I join the USAF, he will be in my mind. If I ever met him, I would not know what to say or do. I would want to ask him so many questions. This book by far is the best book I have ever read and the best book I will ever read.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|One great Movie For A Stressful Day. Does not Require Much Thinking So It Has Become One Of My Favorites.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Overall, this is a very solid, attention-keeping album, and I've only listened to it once through! I'm sure the songs will only grow on me.<br /><br />Oceans Away: One of my favorites. Great piano-based song to start off a piano-based album<br /><br />Oscar Wilde: A very interesting song. Classic Elton with a killer bridge!<br /><br />A Town Called Jubilee: Nice song! Southern theme with a catchy chorus<br /><br />The Ballad of Blind Tom: Decent song. Not much to say. Worth listening to definitely<br /><br />My Quicksand: A ballad that quickly grew on me.<br /><br />Can't Stay Alone Tonight: Another one of my favorites! A picture perfect ballad<br /><br />Voyeur: A breath of fresh air. I see the meaning deeper though that the voyeur we know...<br /><br />Home Again: Simply beautiful. Probably my current favorite<br /><br />Take This Dirty Water: A soul-sounding song that sticks with you<br /><br />The New Fever Waltz: A classic Elton song that gives Home Again and Oceans Away a run for their money!<br /><br />Mexican Vacation: A nice upbeat song to add to the mix.<br /><br />The Diving Board: Great album closer. Shows a more mature Elton.<br /><br />The first two Dream piano interludes are really just extensions of the next song's intro, but nice all the same.<br />Dream #3 however is a standalone piece that captures Elton's best composing ability!<br /><br />Definitely an album to take seriously. His best work in years! Worth every penny!
B008BIZ06M|5.0|Great production by the band. Outstanding quality and the songs are top notch. Kudos to Offspring for continuing to entertain me after all these years.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it is very hard and easy so the same time<br />This is great<br />Can't beat it<br />It is amazing<br />Wow love it
B001AMVN3U|5.0|More like old school Offspring albums and much more entertaining. Good to know the band still has it after all these years.
B00DW36G32|3.0|This movie was ok,<br />good story line, slow though<br />suspenseful<br />Wasn't impressed with the presentation as a whole<br />There are definitely better movies to buy
B0090SI4OC|1.0|I'm not going to go into a grand explanation as there is already plenty of reviews that explain what made this movie so bad. I read the book and actually found it an enjoyable read. (And I am an adult male not a teenager) The book took you on an alien's journey to become more human.<br /><br />This movie however was so poorly put together and illustrated I often asked myself throughout the film if this was simply a recording of a high school play or was it just that their budget was so low. The environments they created were so poorly done and the acting was a perfect match for it.<br /><br />Bottom line - This movie almost made me NOT want to finish the book. Thankfully I still did and found that to be rewarding. The movie is not.
B00EQ0CKRQ|2.0|open the app and it closed its self redownloaded it 3 times didn't work over all wast of money. May be a great app though I wouldn't know.
B00C5R8364|1.0|The Kindle version sample of this book<br />crashes my Kindle for Mac app when I try to open it!  I have downloaded the sample twice with no improvement.  Other full books and samples in my library work properly.  FAIL!
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Like any other Grisham  books this was hard to put down. The was a twist at every turn I highly recommend  it to young an older readers
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I would like the option to select an entire album instead of just one song to be woken up to, otherwise it works fine.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A novel set in North Korea is truly a challenge in credulity and Adam Johnson, pretty much gets away with it. To someone who has served in a diplomatic posting to Pyongyang, his milieu descriptions sounds true and authentic, and you have to grant an author a certain amount of literary freedom in order to keep the narrative moving forward. This is most obvious in the persona of the protagonist, one Jun Do. I have to admit to some skepticism before the purchase, the reason being that I have read a book written by a Japanese chef who worked for Kim Jon-Il, and while Jun Do is a more complicated character than you would encounter in the Hermit Kingdom, Kim Jong-Il is fairly close to the way he is described by his former chef. Johnson has taken a nation hidden behind the bamboo curtain and given us a peek that is as close to anything that is described as truth coming from Pyongyang.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I'll start by saying that I am not a big fan of Zombie flicks. My favorite up to this point had been Zombieland and I watch The Walking Dead with some frequency. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it is certainly worth a watch. Pitt does a fantastic job in the film. It is fun, exciting and different from any zombie film I have seen. I know there are some book snobs on here that have given it lower reviews, which I feel are undeserved. Films based on books rarely follow the book 1:1, it is nearly impossible to do. In addition to that, this film is the kick-off of a trilogy so lets wait until its completed before lambasting WWZ. I recommend it and it gets 2 thumbs up from me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There is so much that's smart and good about this book. I love these kids, and their story, and I feel blessed that I got to spend time in the world the author created for them. There are rare moments in life that I'm aware of how sacred each moment is, even the crappy ones; reading The Fault in Our Stars brought that awareness right to my heart. Highly, highly recommend reading it.<br /><br />I just read some of the negative reviews. While I agree the teenagers could seem unrealistic, it was very easy for me to forgive that, for the beauty in the story. Let yourself be carried away! You won't be sorry.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Jack Reacher seemed to be tapered to Tom Cruises's strengths as an actor - and this film truly deliver a sucker punch of actions, thrills, chills, and twists.  Cruise has done justice to this character and I hope to see more of Jack Reacher in the future.  Well done indeed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Vince's book they are exciting and action packed. Too bad he left us too soon. May he rest in peace!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Nicely crafted and filled with thrills, action, and twists, Oblivion is truly a winner.  Great roles for Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman to show off their acting prowesses.  I feel any fan of sic-fi or future apocalyptic themed films will enjoy screening this film.
B00B8ED7OS|5.0|Wow! What a surprise. This book came highly recommended by a writer friend so I gave it a try and I'm glad I did. I couldn't stop reading it, there are so many aspects, it's enticing, gripping and feels almost dangerous. There is deception, psychological turmoil and clever twists.<br /><br />Monster: Book One by Dani R.R. Hermit and Nevi Star is something of a creative fusion. The writers have developed an exciting blend of erotica, mystery and paranormal. The main characters, Siris and Julian, are fascinating and complex. And the page flies! Check out the detailed description above for an idea of the storyline and be warned the sex is not heterosexual nor typical.<br /><br />Don't be shy about this book, the excitement goes far beyond the steamy scenes, this is a mysterious and original story that demands to be told across multiple books and maybe crossing into other series, I can't wait for more. Even the cover screams this book is different. And different in the exotic and strangely fun kind of different. Go on the adventure . . . you'll have a wild time!
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|Dredd is an upgrade from the original Stallone film.  Screening this film was exciting as it was filled with action, suspense, deception, and, finally, redemption.  For what it is, it is well crafted, graphically pleasing and a lot of fun to view.  I highly recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love the way the three characters interweave with each other.<br />It did take a little bit to keep them organized in my mind though.<br /><br />And.......love the end!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would give this show 100 stars if I could. My husband and I have become addicted to it and don't understand why more shows can't be more like it.<br />Bravo
B002EBDP9G|5.0|An insightful and inspiring work. It's great to see a Brit show so much understanding and affection for the struggles and growth of our great nation. No mater your prior study or knowledge, this book will open new perspectives and help make new connections. Highly recommended
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Beautiful, sophisticated, rousing music that is a blend of modern pop and rock rhythms with classical instruments. Truly astounding and unique artistry!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|DO NOT UPDATE THIS GAME WHEN IT ASKS YOU TO! SKIP THE UPDATES! I was at level 27 and had the moon and sun dragons....double rainbow....as soon as I added the update everything vanished and the game started at the very beginning like I had never played. Very disappointing. Will miss this game. Thought it was adorable. Not willing to start all over again and lose everything all over.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Thought it was great, I don't want to know how they did the tricks. The ending couldn't have been better. It was fun to watch.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This is the first minifig I've ever purchased.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to have my shipment arrive on-time and undamaged. I won't deny that 11-year-old me was shrieking with happiness (thankfully, 31-year-old me was methodical and careful when opening everything up). Both the shipping box and actual figurine box were in good condition.<br /><br />I didn't notice the instructions until I was putting everything back. They were tucked behind the pink cardboard background piece inside the box. Because of this, I was uncertain as to how to remove her face - which sounds much creepier than it is. I finally figured out that I needed to pull her bangs/fringe straight forward away from the front of her body, and they popped right out. Her face quickly followed. The hands were easier to figure out - pop off, pop on.<br /><br />The crying face easily made this a worthwhile purchase for me. My friends have been laughing at the pictures I've shared so far.<br /><br />The figurine is very posable - about as flexible as you'd expect from a small figure with limited ball joints. It only takes a bit of finagling to get her into her classic poses.<br /><br />The little plastic stand that comes with the figurine is a bit weird, but the arm is stable enough and very good at holding the figurine in place.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|first im a brony but this game  isnt very correct<br />the applejack model for example on the the game she has two side ony tails instead on only one
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|I'll chime in here to voice my disgust with the BR version of this incredible film.  I'm truly incredulous at the business practices of Paramount and in the future will think twice before owning their products.  Adding insult to injury, the digital copy code doesn't appear to work.  Contacting Paramount CS on the matter got zero response.  Not surprising, of course, but disappointing nonetheless.  Bottom line, rent this movie or borrow it from a friend, but what ever you do, don't reward the shady business practices of a greedy hollywood studio.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Thoughtful and thought provoking tale with facinating story line and great character development. The author demonstrates the complexity of the human condition and expands the limits of our perspectives on how we relate to each other and our environment.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Awesome and addictive!! Quality tv not some crappy reality show going on Ten years like idol or dancing with the stars.
0307594165|4.0|Morrison's gift with language is what keeps me coming back.  Her characters are so INTERESTING and the setting so believable and you sometimes forget it's fiction.  Yup, she is one of my favorite authors...and still I could never get through Jazz.  This book is similar in that life is shown at its messiest and the character flaws are sometimes alarming.  How can you not love her gift at weaving a scene like you are watching it happen?  But this book was no Paradise or Song of Solomon.  Read those.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Really like Shaun the sheep, great for any age....cannot wait for the film that is supposd to be coming out
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|This is a awesome album 14 songs 8 of which Alan Jackson wrote. He is a legend and Country Music Superstar and it clearly shows in the quality,it consists of earthy, Lonesome music showing American roots. The band is handpicked of the best in the USA. I haven't heard any better and can't say enough about it! It's a MUST HAVE. ENJOY IT
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Although the viewpoints help give you a greater understanding of what's going on in the world it seems as though they are being told by same person. It could be Hana or Lena speaking for either side except you know where they are so you can separate them. The story progresses at a good pace.
B00F91H666|4.0|Don't know why some people didn't like it.  I've seen MUCH worse zombie movies.  I have not read the book so that might have something to do with it.
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|Das Boot. Great movie and as usual, very fast service. just what i expected. Would recommend to any WW2 Geek.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is phenomenal, actually the whole series is phenomenal. This is the 2nd time reading it and I'm sure there will be more. On to book 2.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|For a game that is free; it exceeds all of my expectations.  A must play. Entertaining, and very captivating.  Worth your while.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I've been watching Star Trek since the beginning and have watched all of the movies. The old ones were hard for me to watch but these new ones are great for me. I even knew who Kahn is.
1587143879|5.0|I just received the books, and from the first pages, the books looked to be great, has a lot of information and a lot of extras, i believe this is a good study guide for the CCNA
B000VYX8PE|3.0|I picked up the first three Lemony Snicket books because I saw them free on Amazon one day, and I thought I should read them since most good books are made into movies.<br /><br />\\"Dear Reader,<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that the book you are holding in your hands is extremely unpleasant....\\"<br /><br />True story.<br /><br />I think I would have liked this book more if I was younger. I am not sure I like the Lemony Snicket style of writing. When the author introduces \\"big words,\\" he should allow the reader to interpret the meaning through context clues or a dictionary. I felt the defining of vocabulary throughout the book tiresome and condescending.
0385743564|5.0|I think we can agree that his adult books are better. But his YA books are fun and still a quite a ride to take. I loved the setting and plot behind this book....I think it is actually the best setting of any of his YA books so far....everything this is straight up steel! His characters weren't quite as captivating but you will see why when you read the book. It kind of deals with the nature of the group, not a lot is shared about passed history, at least as far as this first installment goes. But the plot really drives the book I think. If you like Rithmatist or Alcatraz, you will like this book as well. For those that didn't like those, this book does have some Mistborn feel to it, so you might want to try it out.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I really adored this book.  It was a refreshing and unique story told as a fable-for adults.  I think all of us fall into two categories: time is running out, and time is not moving fast enough.  This book really made me think about who I am.<br /><br />I used some of Album's beautifully written words at my uncle's funeral a few months ago and I was able to put together a lovely reading that everyone enjoyed.<br /><br />My favorite:<br /><br />\\"Try to imagine a life without timekeeping. You probably can't. You know the month, the year, the day of the week. There is a clock on your wall or the dashboard of your car. You have a schedule, a calendar, a time for dinner or a movie. Yet all around you, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late. A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing birthdays. an alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures. A fear of time running out.\\"<br /><br />Put this on your to-read list, it's not to be missed.
B001AAHQYM|4.0|Just got this on mp3 and sounds great still. I bought the vinyl copy in the early 80's after discovering UFO' s &#34;Strangers in the night&#34; album. For such a young kid, Michael Schenker' s guitar work is unbelievable. If you've heard later stuff from UFO and liked it; you won't be disappointed. Buy this mp3 if you enjoy their other work.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The other books by Hosseni thrilled me with a connection to my home in Northern California and the many diverse cultures found here.  AND the Mountains connected me to the universal truths of love and connectedness and family.  It is a masterpiece.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is simply amazing, it is so real looking. I feel like I am actually back on the horse riding, or feeding, or mucking, it is great!
B009RX7WTI|5.0|ok I could not imagine my DVD collection without this DVD SET, I watch the TV show .. but its so much better without all those commercials!
B005R32L66|1.0|Doesnt work on kindle fire any longer.  Amazon refuses to support it any longer. Wish I didn't own a kindle fire. It worked until amazon refused to support skype on this device.  Repeated emails and calls make no difference.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey has done an incredible job to date and I would recommend this to everyone. Much better than the default keyboard.
B0063M22QO|4.0|enjoy  very much.  pretty simple puzzles but they do offer a challenge.  Nice to do these without a game board, book or pencils.
B004V9MU86|5.0|I found it a bit tricky to begin with but after the first chapter once I was into the story. I found it hard to put down and just had to read it all. So good.
0060936223|4.0|'Just Kids' makes it clear that quality writing comes naturally to Patti Smith. The book is an engaging read that offers an insider's experience and view of a very creative period and location, the late 1960's and early to mid-1970's in New York City, at the center of arts, poetry, rock'n'roll...and even music! (no, I'm not lying; Puccini's 'Madame Butterfly' gets a brief mention). Smith's writing demonstrates keen insight, intelligence, and the passion of her creative talents. We are fortunate that the author provided this well-written memoir and (auto/)biography of her life and association with fellow creative spirit and soulmate Robert Mapplethorpe (R.I.P.)<br />Recommended.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|A quest in the epic game is to download ice age game no matter how many times I download it won't compete the quest in epic but I do enjoy this game too now it is fun to me and my son

B000FA5SMK|3.0|PLUM ISLAND, located at the northeast end of Long Island, New York, is the first in the DeMille series starring John Corey, master NYPD homicide detective.<br />  While convalescing from gun shot wounds at his Uncle Harry's country home on the island, Corey is approached by the local police chief, an old law enforcement friend, who needs help in investigating a double homicide. A very popular husband and wife (PhD) scientific team employed at the ultra-secret biological animal research facility on Plum Island has been murdered. The government center is the equivalent of the Center for Disease Control at Atlanta for humans. The Gordons' had befriended Corey during his recovery and he now feels an obligation to help in a consulting capacity to solve the murders.<br /> It's not long before Corey becomes deeply involved in the investigation along with the local police, the FBI and CIA, and an enticingly beautiful female Suffolk County detective who is heading up the investigation.<br /> As the story unravels, John Corey goes in one direction in the investigation while the rest of the team pursues another. DeMille presents enough twists and turns to keep the story moving. He has also thrown in a couple of love interests that divide Corey's attention and make for good reading. However, as in the case with other DeMille writings, the story could have been tightened and shortened. The author could have used a good content editor. A few less smart aleck comments from Corey would have gone a long way in this regard.<br /> The story is interesting, somewhat of a page turner, but drags into boredom in spots. I give DeMille credit for a well-written ending.<br />  I rate the book a 3.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like the storyline and the characters, but the acting could be a lot better. Seems like was filmed in a big rush?

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The picture was jerky and freezing when viewing videos with Hulu and other online content. My TV is 20 feet from new wireless router. Would be nice to be able to plug in an either net cable so I could hard wire it to the router. I purchased it from the Google store august 10,2013. When it didn't work  I called Google support with in a few days after I received it. I asked for a RMA # to return it. They wouldn't give a number right away. They said they had to send my request up the ladder. I called again the next day and finally was emailed a return label. I returned everything just like it came. After several calls and emails I still haven't received my refund. My latest call was Sept,25,2013 and was told they are going to send my request up to the next customer service level. I wouldn't recommend this thing unless your sure you want to keep it.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This family is challenged by the war and shows how their individual personalities are exposed in how they truly cared for their fellow citizens. The story moves a little slow but it also exposes situations that even the servants see and how they also have their own reporting hierarchy. I liked the mix of the American and the English culture and how they clash at times yet they come together.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I watched the first two seasons in 3 days.  The drama and cliffhanger endings to the episodes make me keep coming back.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|This is a great movie, must see movie, the best iron man movie so far, great movie to kill time
B00F35BV64|4.0|This is a fun movie and I missed one of the series so I hadn't yet seen the new cast - and I like them. I saw this during a bumpy plane ride and it was perfect because my brain read the turbulence as part of the effects of the show - so it didn't bother me at all.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|If you like his other books, you'll like this one. Blew through it in two days. My only complaint: that I had to wait for it to come out. If only Sanderson put out a new book every month, maybe THEN I'd be satisfied (unlikely).
0894803123|3.0|Bought this with ice cream machine this summer.  Had seen Ben & Jerry speak at school commencement and wanted to check out their recipes.  However this was a little too simple, i.e., crushing up cookies/candy/etc. and adding to ice cream.  Duh, I already knew how to do this.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Great story line that the whole family enjoyed. Lessons were learned by all.  This movie made for a great family night!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie. Lots of fantastic actors/plot held together well. Don't go to movie theaters these days, so this is definitely a keeper. Highly recommend it to SF/Trek fans, or anyone wanting to escape for a hour or so.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|One of the best so far. Hurry up Mr. Martin!<br />I better read more about JonSnow in the next one though.

B005544TRQ|4.0|Not realistic or engaging, but entertaining. Would rather watch something like Northern Exposure, but no one is making shows like that anymore.
0316228583|5.0|A dark and disturbing novel about many people you have already met one place or another.  This book hits on a host of social issues, including:<br />1. Drug and alcohol abuse/addiction<br />2. Ghettos/Projects/NIMBY<br />3. Bullying<br />4. Homosexuality<br />5. Welfare systems<br />6. Social Class and Social Mobility<br />7. Self mutilation<br />8. Good and Bad of Social Media<br />It does this in an entertaining way, and in my mind without making judgments.  I have no idea why she left her safe harbor of HP for such treacherous and challenging turf.  I guess to prove she could, and possibly to force people to think about the grittier things in life.<br /><br />There is no happy ending here, so there are many who will automatically dislike this book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00196YNWU|5.0|Classic my Grandaughter loves it. We sing all day we love singing she knows her broadway and she's only 4:-)
B00F91H666|3.0|It was fast paced and over quickly.  I enjoyed it but the story seemed to flounder at the end.  You should watch it.
1594136742|5.0|The story showcases a persons ability to heal and mature while making a very difficult hike seem secondary. Very we'll done. A great journey.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is so beautifully layered, so perfectly penned that  I ,with joy I can say it is the best of the best. Just pick it up and read. I promise it will touch your heart, and maybe, just maybe it will change it. Don't hesitate to buy this book. It will stay with you for a very long time, and please believe me, that is a very good thing. This is the fourth time I have read this story, and as I get older with each reading, I find something new. Skip Starbucks, and use the money to buy this book. You will never regret it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My husband has become addicted to this game and now I am too. It's a fun spin off from the movie!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I have been whining to my family lately about how all the movies suck lately. Im sick of remakes and super hero flicks. So, I took a chance and was hooked in the first few minutes. Exciting and funny all the way through. I will buy this one for my collection.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Interesting book on family relationships and how children survive. It is an unusual setting and very interesting on a different way to raise children.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|If you are having doubts about purchasing this CD...Leave them behind.  This CD is near perfect in every way.  The band sounds inspired and the extra guitar makes for a thicker more lush rock sound.  The second CD is a must have...From Elvis Costello and Dr. John to Steve Winwood...Just amazing music.  Thank you Warren and Co.
0688014291|4.0|I like the product very much. It arrived much later than I expected, but the product was as good as it was described to be.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved the way the story & characters are wavered together. Finished it in a day & wished it could have been longer.
080419257X|2.0|Yeah...this book's gotten a lot of press, so I'm sure a lot readers have already posted similar reviews, but I'll go ahead anyway.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />1. Mr. Aslan tries very hard to stick with 'just the facts, ma'am' approach to the historical Jesus. His attempt at stripping away all the theological layers basically leaves him with two facts: Jesus lived in Nazareth at some point in his life, and he died on a Roman cross. Everything after that is educating conjecture on his part, and he admits it freely.<br /><br />2. He did not attempt to debunk, embitter, or enrage Christians by provocative language that he, as a New Testament scholar, would know better to use. (Although I'm sure many Christians would say otherwise.)<br /><br />3. He is passionate about his historical research, taking the time to view the Q documents and Dead Sea Scrolls, as well as Jewish historical accounts (Josephus, the Mishnah, etc).<br /><br />4. I really liked his contribution about the Roman and Jewish accounts of zealotry during the first century. I wish he would have elaborated more on those--perhaps if he gave more than anecdotal sentences about the various Jewish zealots during the lifetime of Jesus, it would have given more credence to his argument that Jesus was one of them.<br /><br />The neutral:<br /><br />1. Mr. Aslan, although a New Testament scholar, offers this book as not an academic account with hundreds of footnotes, but for the layman. Helpful at times, at other times more annoying, because sometimes it is not clear if Mr. Aslan came to that conclusion, or another scholar did.<br /><br />The not-so-good/annoying:<br /><br />1. It was very difficult to understand which Bible translation he was reading. On occasion, he specifically left out parts of a verse (or added to) to make his own point. For example, when Jesus is speaking in the synagogue, and he stands up to read Isaiah 61:1, as quoted in Luke 4:18, Reza quotes him as speaking this: \\"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God\\". This is NOT what Jesus says in Luke 4. Jesus omits the last section, \\"and the day of vengeance of our God\\", and then says instead, \\"Today, this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing\\". But Mr. Aslan's argument that Jesus of Nazareth was a zealot rests on the part, \\"And the day of vengeance of our God\\". There were other examples where I could not determine what translation he was using, although I believe he said it was the Revised Standard Version. True?<br /><br />2. It seemed to me that anyone who attended seminary, Bible college, or college level Bible instruction, would easily say, \\"Huh? That's not right\\" in too many chapters. For instance, Mr. Aslan claims Paul did not see Jesus as an earthly figure, only as the 'spiritual' and 'literal' Son of God. Oh, come on! Too easy! and I don't care to hash out an argument in a review here. And that Paul called Peter, James, and John the 'mutilators of the flesh, the dogs' because they were Jewish believers who followed the Torah in Philippians 2. Shoot. Too easy, man!<br /><br />That's all I got so far. I hope that whets someone's appetite to read it! If not, there will be plenty of those who might want you to talk with them about it, so read it anyway.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It took me a very long time to read this book, it was often emotionally draining & deeply disturbing, but I'm glad I read it.
B000N3ST7A|4.0|Stevie Nicks definitely has a uniquely beautiful voice that is a pleasure to listen to in the evening. I will always be thankful for what she brought into my world.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book is very well written and held my attention from the first page. I highly recommend it! Great Book!
B00006IM9Q|3.0|I definitely do like some of her songs and would like to hear it more than I do in my environment. Beautiful and unusual music is in short supply and needs to reinforced in the usual environment.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Unsure how one reviews a song. One generally likes it or doesn't like it. I hope one isn't wasting money on just random music.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very fine and god for the kids, the movie is beautifull, run very well in my tablet
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Who doesn't love GAGA!!! I added this to my work out routine rotation.<br /><br />Unsure how one reviews a song. One generally likes it or doesn't like it. I hope one isn't wasting money on just random music.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|This was a really good movie no other zombie movie can compare to this one lots of action a good story and a decent ending just hope they make another.
6305428050|5.0|This is one of my FAV all-time movies. I am glad to finally have it in my collection. Its a 80's-90's ICONIC movie.
B001676320|5.0|My son at age of 21 really like this type of music and bands.<br />these 2 bands made the greatest song for him to listen to.<br />He enjoyed very much.
B0016MJ6T2|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! It's based on a real story. SUPER CULTISH! Be warned: you may find yourself talking like them :P
B00CHILW64|1.0|this is supposed to be a good movie, but it was interrupted every minute (not an exaggeration) by buffering<br />we couldn't finish it<br />i'm trying to figure out if I can get a refund, but no success so far.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|When was the last time you saw an anime film with such strong family-oriented values? Yeah, me neither. &#34;Summer Wars&#34; is simply genius! Solid pacing, fun, great suspenseful moments, scenes that will tug at your heartstrings, and even cool action moments! This movie has almost everything, and the romance doesn't feel as forced as it usually does. It's very cute and charming, and the characters are instantly likeable. The ending will keep you on the edge of your seat and it's very emotionally satisfying. Just buy it already.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Bought this and the LEGO minecraft village for my daughter's 10th birthday.  10 year olds all seem to love mincraft, so I think it was a good decision.  Shipping was quick and the product is as described.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|LOVED it. It is great to watch something that you haven't heard anything about good or bad and it turns out to be incredibly entertaining...something you'd watch again and again. The acting, the characters, the story, the special effects, the ending...all of it was enjoyable. never boring or slow at any point. and this movie definitely tries to mislead you throughout. while youre watching a bunch of magic tricks, the movie is one big magic trick. so don't expect to have everything explained or for it to be realistic.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Got this for my daughters 10th birthday.  She loves minecraft, as does every other 10 year old from what I gather.  She has one of these lego sets already.  I think she'll also enjoy this one.  Shipping was quick and the product is as described.
B00F91H666|5.0|I loved it.  Smart, funny, and original. It was half as much on Amazon as on demand. I watched it twice
B00DU73T08|3.0|It is a good story that gets you involved with the main characters. There is all the good elements such as drama, action, comedy etc. Things started to unravel near the end with contradictions in the story line. There should have been an alternative ending offered. Unfortunately too many movies ride on emotion and fantasy by hoping the audience is too stupid to catch the contradictions and inconsistencies. Should have waited till it was offered on prime.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|Excellent movie with non-stop action. Matt Damon, was excellent as the main character. As in all the Matt Damon &#34;Bourne&#34; movies, I would highly recommend them, if you are in to edge of your seat action.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|It's almost over, but it will end with a bang. I can't wait to watch season 9. Barney is my favorite character on TV right now.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|His age is starting to show, the premise of the movie was a little ridiculous as was the action. Fairly predictable in plot and conclusion.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Just listened to the new Dream Theater Cd and found it to be some of the most satisfying music that I have ever heard.  Illumination Theory is perhaps the most amazing song I have ever heard, and the lush textures woven into the music are inspirational.  Being a bass player I love the bass lines and tone that John Myung uses to propel these great songs.  let the music do the talking and pick this one up...
B0090SI4OC|5.0|The movie came on time! And I absolutely love it! It is a great buy, and I would recommend it too
B003F3FJQO|2.0|I loved the first book in this series, but this second installment was flat for me. The story never captures you, it's only reading words... No emotional connection or suspense.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|Delivery was excellent.<br />The case is very nice but;<br /> The lens and camera is must look down all the time.<br />I believe this is not very good for my camera.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I just reread the David Sedaris entire catalog and believe that When You are Engulfed in Flames to be his bet.  If someone were to read just one of his books I would probably suggest this one.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Pure genius.  THIS is what &#34;being an artist&#34; is really all about.  The creativity and emotion and fun in The Piano Guys music is tops!
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Ok so the movie is a good one but that's not why i am hear. The vid had playback problems and i could not watch it was going to contact amazon but i got side tracked and forgot but they somehow new that it dint work and gave me a refund. So thanks amazon for watching my back lol likening you guys more all the time.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Why is there gems for Rarity and Rainbow Dash? That just sucks. Everyone hates that you know? That was a very stupid idea. Do you even know that kids are now complaining? You are just doing that idea to make everyone hate you and you are being greedy and erased a 6 year old&quot;s ponies. That is so rude and you guys got to change your attitude because people won`t play this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is addicting do not play it or you will lose all your friends. I think I am still married now but I am not putting the game down to find out.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Neat game to play. Need more levels. Will play game more often. Level 10 was super hard. That is all I have to say
B000001FQI|5.0|the vocals and music, are perfect.  in my book, its a top ten album,  of all time.  a must for every one.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|Very good mystery.  I didn't know &#34;who dun it&#34; until the end.  I love this kind of mystery.  Thank you.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Lean In challenged me to look at my own &#34;limiting&#34; language and behaviors rooted in historical stereotypes.  Sandberg gave practical guidance about common pitfalls in thinking and how to grow past them.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Book was a great read! love this series so far!The author is great at going from one exciting thing to the next! Never any dull moments!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I really like this app. All the levels are very chalenging and exciting! It is really adicting! I recomend it!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Very relevant and timeless lyrics.  poetry. beautiful. Has already made it to my favorites of all time list.. Have been telling everyone I know about it so they can hear for themselves.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Very well done. Between the monologues and the double-crossing it really moved along. Could not wait to watch the next episode/s.<br />And five more words just for the heck-of-it.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Always loved Self Portrait.  This is great. It is, and always was, Bob doing his thing.  As far as I was concerned in 1970, it was something new and different.  Loved the strings, vocals.  Great without them, too.  The tracks from New Morning, Nashville Sky are real bonuses.  Nice to have a good clear remastering of Bob and The Band at Isle of White,  my old bootleg LP was pretty terrible.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I'm so happy I found this album! Like all bands they have their influences but even with that they have found their own sound that works for them. They are very dark, but not so much that you walk away wanting to kill yourself or them. But more of a cathartic experience that releases some of the sadness and leaves you feeling lighter.
B00ANQMZOK|3.0|Well, this DVD doesn't play on my machine.  CD's were fine, good sound, but the whole package went back to Amaz.  Anybody get this region &#34;0&#34; thing to play?
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|So excited to give this to my son for Christmas! This series is sold out at Lego.com. I think Amazon is the only place to get it now!
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Johnny Depp was great as the main character. My kids love the movie as well. It was funny and the cast did a great job of playing the supporting characters.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Unless you find a very expensive pair of headphones on clearance you simply won't beat the quality of these headphones for the price you pay.  They work exactly as advertised and the volume can be adjusted either with a dial on the headphones or with the included software on your computer.  I think the most enjoyable feature of the headphones is that the microphone auto-mutes when tilted up for the times when you need to talk to someone else in the room.  The design is very sturdy and the headphones are very comfortable even during extended use.  You get between 7 to 9 hours of continuous use wirelessly and after that the cord included is long enough to continue to use them while they charge.  Overall another great product by Logitech and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of headphones.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|Now I would like to read the book - I am sure a lot was left out of the movie
0307346617|4.0|I'm not usually much of a reader, but I decided to pick this book up after hearing so much about it.  I wasn't disappointed.  Every zombie fan should give this book a read, the author does a great job of painting the landscape of a post apocalyptic, zombie-ridden earth.  It's worth noting to the people that saw the movie first that this book has absolutely no connection to the movie other than the name, but that doesn't mean the book isn't worth reading in its own right.  I'd also highly recommend the day by day armageddon series by J.L. Bourne, another great series of zombie books.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|I really like that book! When I was in second or third grade my friend had bought this book I started to read it and enjoy it but I didn't get to finish the book but now since I have finished the I really liked it.
0345803493|5.0|These book were awesome!! I could not put them down. I can't wait for the movie!! I hope it doesn't dissappoint.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|I really love this game. I love how each character has a story of why they got hurt and how the patient talks to you though out the operation. Be prepared though,to finish the operation completely you will have to buy more tools with actual money ,but otherwise its a great game and i would definitely recommend it to anyone. So try it out!
0345803507|5.0|These books were awesome!! I could not put them down.  I can't wait for the movie!!! I hope it doesn't disappoint.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Pretty good shoot'em up flic.<br />Not much for the brain, but still kind of fun to watch.<br />Also pretty good affects.
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|it's a classic that is really forgotten.  I'm doubt the remake they are making is not going to do this any justice. it's a great movie.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I was excited to see this movie, because I loved the book and the movie with Robert Redford. Leonardo Dicaprio was a good Gatsby but overall not as good as the original.
B002ZG9846|5.0|how can you not like 12 year old little girl kicking butt and killing mobsters a plus is that you get to see Nicolas Cage being a big daddy bad ass.
B00F91H15W|1.0|I rented this movie because I knew the story from the news. The loud rap music was distracting and pointless.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I love it much better on Blu-ray and 46in LCD. If you like Sci-Fi movies this movie is one of the best.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|Tom Hanks Really,Really made it a great series when he directed this and he has such a great voice to narrate it also......enough said.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Brad Pitt + zombies should have been a recipe for success. I still had hopes for this film, even after mixed reviews and all of the talk about the many problems that occurred during filming. The decision to go with a PG-13 rating was probably the first mistake, as much of the bite was removed (pun intended.) There was nothing frightening in this film, and Pitt seemed almost robotic. Perhaps he should have played a zombie.<br /><br />The one scene we all saw in the trailer that showed the zombies frantically climbing on top of each other to reach the top of a massive wall was pretty cool. But while watching it, I thought, \\"This is a nice little piece of CGI,\\" and not, \\"This is a terrifying scene.\\"<br /><br />There are much better zombie films out there, and I'd recommend skipping this, or wait until it shows up on Netflix. In the meantime, I'll happily recommend the BEST zombie film I've ever seen (actually, a British miniseries): Dead Set.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I love this movie!!!!  I am an adult and I probably watch it once a month!  It is a beautiful story and a pure joy to see!  Two of my favorite actors, Emma Thompson and Colin Firth star in this family movie and the children are enchanting, even when they are being absolutely impossible which is 90% of the time!  I have a feeling that I am not the only adult around who loves this piece of entertainment!!!  In spite of oneself and the daily grind, one finds oneself wanting to believe that there is a &#34;Nanny McPhee&#34; around to pull the desperate out of their desperate situations!  &#34;Nanny McPhee, we need you!&#34;
B00C10N3EW|5.0|My local pbs station has been playing the DVD of this album during their beg a thon. I was moved.
B001FA0NOM|5.0|a complete book with a lot of examples and references - the bibliography is very useful also<br />a clear style and a very good approach of game theory<br /><br />I'm very glad I read this book !
B00BB8UJKG|2.0|This movie had nothing funny about it. The only thing I gathered from it was a feeling of overall pedophilia. Disgusting.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This game came pre-loaded on my Kindle Fire and I played it several times before I discovered the 24/7 Games versions.  So now I don't play this version at all.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My kids love to watch Shaun the sheep and this is a very good entertainment for the parents as well. It doesn't have lot of sound/music and so it's perfect for kids.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I didn't know I could access YouTube on my Kindle Fire.  Once I learned I could, I use this app almost every day.  My main interests are music and gaming sites. It is not the full-blown YouTube browser but it gets the job done. Best to have your ear buds on.
B00005JNJV|1.0|I know I am the exception among reviewers, but I found this movie far too dark.  When I saw it in the theater nearly 10 years ago, I was left with an oppressed, heavy feeling that lasted for a long time afterward, which is why seeing the two sequels was absolutely out of the question for me.  This is definitely not an exuberant action movie.  It is a crime story, with enormous disasters affecting huge numbers of people, and I think it is significantly darker than even the first two Spider-Man movies (which, by the way, were all I could stomach).  The more recent Spider-Man and Batman movies are not Tim Burton black comedy or bright and crisp action adventures like Indiana Jones; they are the most broodingly dark action movies I have ever seen.  The effect this movie had on me long-term was so deep that it went beyond depression, all the way to oppression, through its film noir-like or Nietzschean version of a godless society, where justice can only be achieved through power instead of through strength of character.  I still remember portions of it quite vividly from that one viewing.  Also, Hans Zimmer's music is oppressively dark through the entire movie, and also has just one motif based on two notes, and very very little creativity.<br /><br />I would also add that the sequel, The Dark Knight, which I didn't see except for clips on YouTube, was a direct influence on the Aurora, Colorado theater massacre by James Holmes, and that The Dark Knight deserves some blame for that massacre in that the Joker character was who James Holmes was dressing up as and aspiring to be.  What you watch DOES affect you.<br /><br />Two-sentence summary:  I wrote this review just now because I feel compelled to caution you about the overwhelming darkness of the movie.  You may be accustomed to something this dark, but if you are not, pay heed!
034580404X|5.0|I love all the books i had a good time reading them and letting everyone now how good they are....
0425263916|2.0|I just thought this book was OK although I can see I'm grossly in the minority.  I love a good smut book when it comes along and it doesn't even have to be believable. I just want the characters to have SOME redeeming qualities. I get that Eva and Gideon are both messed up. They both have baggage. In these types of books the characters ALWAYS do--that's what makes the story good. It's what makes them relate-able. In this book, however, Eva is clingy and depressing and annoying and Gideon is a sketchy a-hole. The relationship between the two is ridiculous. Eva says she's in love Gideon despite the fact that he refuses to be forthcoming about anything that has to do with his past. He's jealous and volatile to a fault. I could buy the attraction in the first book, but I feel like by now their relationship should be more than just crazy, passionate sex scenes. I get that he's supposed to be super hot and that they have this wicked attraction that neither of them can stand, but c'mon. There is only so far attraction can take you and even less that can keep forgiving the same selfish behavior. It was a relief to finally read what happened to Gideon, but I'm still wondering why it took two books for it to be revealed...
B008MWBY6W|4.0|When I had recently purchased my Canon T3i Rebel this bag had come with it free of charge. Naturally I was rather excited, and knowing it would be a small bag I was expecting to replace it in the near future. Today I have received my Opteka Excursion Series C700, but my times using this bag were some very good times and even if I had paid full price I would feel it would be fair. The bag itself held my camera with one lens, all my cables, and a flash diffuser, which isn't bad, but once I started to purchase more accessories such as filter kits and lenses it was clear it would only be something to be taken on short trips. The bag is also waterproof, which was nice when I had taken it on my Chicago trip and it had rained, leaving my equipment perfectly dry. The inside of the bag is nice and smooth with little velcro tabs that can be adjusted.<br /><br />And Now the cons. Well for one it's small, which is fine for just basic things, but investing in a more expensive bag early on may not be a bad idea. The strap feels a bit awkward after a few hours of wearing, and I didn't see the cushion helping that much, then again I'm tiny so it could just be that. It looks silly, It will do the job but you will look silly in the process.<br /><br />Overall, not bad at all, but not perfect. I could see myself still using it occasionally for the more quiet trips around the scenic areas of town, but that's about it.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|We enjoy the stories and characters.  It seems to be a favorite genre of both my self and my husband.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Good read and flows will with the next several books giving it a hidden depth that I hope will be seen in the upcoming movie.
1426308469|4.0|Our son is a dinosaur fan and this book will grow with him. The pictures are beautiful and the information is astounding!  Love it!
B000FCK65W|5.0|Such a wonderful book.  I got so interested in the characters and hated it when the story ended!  So glad it was our book club's choice to read.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I loved this movie and the kids did also watched it and they liked it allot. A must have, get if today.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's pretty annoying when you're trying to drop coins in exactly the right place, and all of a sudden, a Charmin ad pops up and stays on the screen for a whole minute, completely distracting (and making impossible to play) from an otherwise fun game.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|It was cool to watch in 3D, but not for kids under 13 I think. Nice action packed. Get it today.
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|By far the worst Iron Man movie, I've seen. The story line was predictable<br />and the acting was notorious. The one line jokes were not funny<br />and the movie made Iron Man look like a weak hero. I only wasted<br />five bucks on this movie. However the biggest waste was the 2+hrs<br />I spent watching this poor excuse of a movie. REAL BAD!!
B008M721MS|5.0|I love this app since it saved me from buying a mic which may have costed 20$ or more. And this app is fairly good or amasing in what it does...
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|I have played it before on his beta and I liked this version very much.  Altought it heats my kindle fire too much.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is great, my children love  to play it and don't realize they are learning. Just make sure to monitor them so they aren't using your credit card!
B00ABT39MG|5.0|I liked it very much, it's a single so it only have four songs and most are versions of the same song.  But I'm a fan of RAMMSTEIN so I had to buy it and I liked it a lot.
B00095NX9G|5.0|This DVD is a great set for dancers with beginner and intermediate skill sets.  Some of the steps aren't broken down (such as the triple step) therefore some preliminary skills are expected.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The remake was different, but the plot and action were good.  The movie is worth spending the time to watch it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good job with the game and hailey won't have to be a bit like the last few days later this month of the last batch and hailey Glassman to pick up girl whenever the last time you need to know where you can get it ought king and hailey Jones said the song eve of a color scheme to pick a color of the last time you need to pick up girl game of the last time to pick up girl whenever you can get it ought to be a color scheme to pick up the last time you can also be a bit more of duty in the last few days later this month in a colored show go on to pick the song of the show go to pick the last few days after the show go back to the scheme of the last time you so Windy
B00821OX98|4.0|If you want something to just be 'entertained' its fun.  You  have to set aside some logic and just go with it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|*************************I don't think you have to see the ratings and decide to watch or not...This is one of the best movies I would love to watch again and again
B0050DIWFC|5.0|So many twists and turns!  I kept changing my mind on who did what.  The last third of the book had me in suspense...could not believe how many twists in the story.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|The research, production and direction of this documentary were excellent. And our growing lack of empathy for others, as well as ourselves, has attained alarmingly new heights. While the  distressing information is enlightening and new...the direction that we are moving...is not. In the words of Leo DiCaprio in &#34;The 11th Hour,&#34; we are facing a &#34;convergence of crises&#34; and it's clearly in sight of us...just up ahead.
B0096HI226|3.0|It was what I thought it would be. Little school boys humpin a stage with a typical love plot. I won't spoil it but ughhh so predictable.Thankyou to the seller for prompt deliver and intact content.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very well written with twists and turn to keep you looking around the corner. Inside the mind of each character the reader lives their thoughts. It makes you wonder if our lives are up to fate.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The whole rumor of this &#34;sealing the deal&#34; didn't really work. Other than that she said it was a good book. Fellas it depend on you woman.
031623480X|4.0|I don't usually read book like this. -Some would say a diet book, others an avenue to a way of life. They're just not normally something I'd gravitate to. I guess what made me pick it up was Perlmutter's belief that sugar, wheat and gluten, beyond the foundation for weight gain (which so many people already know,and much has been written about),  is its terrifying effect on our brain. Perlmutter lays out, in pretty easy to understand terms, how our increasing addiction to bread, bagels, pasta, baked goods and processed foods are the rot behind headaches, depression, anxiety, but most frightening of all, Dementia and Alzheimer's. It can be overwhelming a bit as you come to find that nearly everything in your (well, I'll say my) pantry is pretty lousy for you. Perlmutter sets out a four week program to achieving a lifestyle that is fronted with low low low carbohydrates, and high protein. Rounded out with exercise and good sleeping patterns, he encloses a large section of recipes, as well as supplements our bodies have been depleted of, we need for optimal mental well being. I don't know that I will or can be capable of following this to the letter. But I do know that since I've been reading a week ago, I haven't touched anything that has flour or added sugar in it, and have already dropped four pounds.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The whole rumor of this &#34;sealing the deal&#34; didn't really work. Other than that she said it was a good book. Fellas it depend on you woman.
157421327X|5.0|This book is a great beginner book that will show you how to &#34;zentangle.&#34; I call it organized doodling. As other reviewers have said, there are many patterns available online. But, I am glad that I purchased this beginner book.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I found the story disturbing since it is  reflection on the current events happening in our society today.  I was disturbed at how brutal and children and adults.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Probably the best comic to movie adaptation ever.  Dredd pulls no punches and doesn't sh away from violence, just like the comic, and he never takes his helmet off!
B002KT3XH6|5.0|I have not found a better insight into the lives and wives of Henry VIII than that written by Weir.  Clearly well researched on each Queen, Weir weaves the tapestry of each of the six lives with that of the son of Queen Elizabeth and King Henry VII.  From young boy forced to marry his deceased brother's betrothed bride, Henry makes his boastful, lustful, arrogant march through these beautiful, enticing, smart, and bewitching women hoping all, or one, will provide him with the heir he needs to maintain his kingdom.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Many great actors. Makes you feel like you know them. Exciting stories.and wonderful parts. can't wait to buy it. Great
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show!!! This is a show that my Hubby and I can sit down and truely enjoy together!  It's also something that I can ejoy with my girlfriends.  I get sad everytime an episode ends, LOL.

B00E5C3AJM|3.0|I thought it would be really super fun to be in Italy.... But I had a moment of our terror when I saw they override my whole entire game and the new game just made it worse. I'd give it a one It wasn't so darn fun. But I'm disappointed still. And I'm really sick of it restarting over and over again.
0812993845|3.0|Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite authors.  I patiently wait for each new novel to be released.  I loved the Shopaholic series, but it's her stand alone novels that I prefer, so I was really excited to get my hands on this one.  Unfortunately, it's taken me a while to read this novel - I just couldn't get into it as fast as I usually do.<br /><br />The main character(Lottie) is pretty much the same heroine that appears in all of her books - witty if not a tad ditzy, flawed, etc.  And, like all the others, finds herself in a lot of sticky situations.  I don't know.  Maybe it's me..... but I just could not get involved with these characters this time around.  But I still love Sophie Kinsella - and I still like all her books.  I will continue to read them as they come out.  If you're already a fan, give it a go..... if you're unfamiliar with her works, maybe stick to the Shopaholic series or Twenties Girl (one of my favorites!)
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love the Sons of Anarchy keep you on your toes. Did not know what going to happen next. I can wait for the next seasons. The actor's a can play there parts very well. Keep up the excellent work.

B003M70O5O|5.0|My favorite new show cant wait to watch the rest of the them. Amazing writing and actors and story. Great
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Through Amazon Prime I have been able to watch the entire Downton Abbey series from the first episode of Season 1 through the last cliffhanger of an episode of Season 3 in the span of 3 weeks.<br />  This is an amazing series! The portrayal of the Earl of Grantham (played masterfully by Hugh Bonneville) and his family in Yorkshire as they move from pre-WWI though the war and into post-WWI is indeed an historical masterpiece.<br />  I greatly enjoyed the elaborate  portrayal of Downton itself as a living entity, kept alive to maintain the rich tradition of the pre-war countryside estate.<br />  The mansion is glorious in its decor. The costumes are exquisite, changing with the times over the course of the series.<br />  The best part of the series, in my opinion, is the character development. From  the Crawley sisters down to the lowly kitchen maid, each character is given life and dimension, fleshed out by subtleties such as Lady Mary's Mona Lisa smile and beloved Butler Carson's barely audible groans of disapproval.<br /> The relationship between family  and house staff is fascinating. Two distinct classes, co-existing in the same house, totally inter-dependent yet seperate. The ladies' maids and the men's valets have rather charming personal relationships with the family member they serve. They assist in dressing, grooming, and keeping the schedule. Yet, unspoken is the role of confidant and companion to persons who lead a grand but often lonely life.<br />  Another dimension of the series I enjoy is the intrigue that goes on among the &#34;downstairs&#34; staff. Not as refined as their &#34;upstairs&#34; counterparts, many resort to sabotage and deceipt to get what they want....  a better position among the staff or the affections of another household member.<br />  I would be remiss if I did not mention the beautiful outdoor scenes in the series. The land surrounding Downton is lush and green. In Season 3, the family goes to the Highlands in Scotland to visit. The tour of the Scottish countryside is breathtaking.<br />  I am so glad to have the availability of this wonderful series at my fingertips through Prime. I cannot wait for Season 4!!he tour of the Scottish countryside is breathtaking.<br />  I am so glad to have the availability of this wonderful series at my fingertips through Prime. I cannot wait for Season 4!!
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|First of all - Dream Theater is my favorite band. Period.<br />I like the old stuff. I love the new stuff. My two fave albums are Dramatic Turn of Events, and Scenes, and maybe Six Degrees thrown in there too. Dramatic Turn of Events is my favorite DT album. Despite not having MP it is urgent, with great songs and spectacular guitar tone that makes me want to buy a Petrucci Ernie Ball guitar (which I did), a TC Electronic Dreamscape pedal (which I did) and a Boogie Mark V (which I do not have). So the new album is DT, and I love DT. You can't go wrong (OK, maybe not so much with Black Clouds - it was horrible). It is almost impossible to follow up and top Dramatic Turn of Events.<br />On the new album the things that stand out are the orchestration and Jordan's keyboarding(!). They are really cool. Very evocative of Six Degrees. I found myself blurting out loud \\"that's cool\\" over what Jordan used or played, and I said that several times about cool little Petrucci parts. But the guitar didn't grab me and reduce me to speechless awe like Dramatic Turn of Events.<br />Very over-produced album, especially bass, which tries too hard to sound like Geddy in tone, and the vocals, which are way doubled (which is actually a good thing). This album beats most of their catalog, but I want more. I want that \\"chocolate cake\\" tone that Petrucci talked about in the studio (look it up).<br />And what is with the self-titled album direction?
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|love mirrors and suit and tie.  my faves by far.  i loved the performance on SNL and kept on listening to those songs over and over.
B005974CDU|5.0|First of all - Dream Theater is my favorite band. Period.<br />I like MP. I like Mangini. I don't care about the break, etc. I like the old stuff. I love the new stuff. Dramatic Turn of Events is my favorite DT album. Despite not having MP it is urgent, with great songs and spectacular guitar tone that makes me want to buy a Petrucci Ernie Ball guitar (which I did), a TC Electronic Dreamscape pedal (which I did) and a Boogie Mark V (which I do not have). The guitar in Dramatic Turn of Events grabbed me and reduced me to speechless awe - Outcry, Breaking all Illusions, Lost Not Forgotten. Especially that last one, which makes my credit card want to challenge my credit limit by leaping from my wallet to buy a Boogie Mark V.  (Really!)<br />And Bridges in the Sky (Whaaaat!) is so cool and was an amazing way to start a live concert (saw them June 28, 2012 in KC).
B000SX9IXO|5.0|How many ways to say this is one of the greatest albums of all time?? I have been listening to this album since its release 1969(?) and continue to listen to it today. It is still just as listenable today as then. Timeless pieces music played to perfection.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|Love this show, very good cast, 4th season definitely delivers, what a disfunctional family, kinda makes me shake my head...<br />If you loved first three seasons, you will be glued to your TV for this one as well
B005LAIIMG|5.0|It has a great plot and many twists. They did a good job of recreating the book with the essentials only and kept it entertaining.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|Actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Rebecca Hall, and especially Adelaide Clemens are absolutely delightful in this adaptation. The series is a light touch of the brush to reveal the good, bad and terribly ugly world of British snobbery before and during WWI. Heroes and villains alike struggle under the surreal pressure of an out-of-touch ruling class, while true love, kindness and genuine fairness soldier on beneath the veneer. Exquisite? Yes, quite so. Watch it. You will smile, frown, cry, laugh and often find yourself aghast. (BTW: using Amazon's Video Library service is the bee's knees. Try that too, if you haven't.)
B0063GORYU|5.0|When I first downloaded the game, I had no idea how to played the game. I guess it was after my third tried at the game that I caught on to it. Now, I just can't put it down. It is the last game that I play before going to bed and the first one in the morning,
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|A great way to pass a ton of time. Never gets old be careful not to buy gems or hero's just earn gems by playing easy levels and work with the hero's you are given.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Hard to understand what you need to do. I just don't like it at all. Needs to be better to understand.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game with Manny and all the other fun characters from the ice age movie. Would surely recommend this game to anyone.
1551525143|5.0|This book managed to touch me on so many levels. It did not take long for this to become my favorite graphic novel of all time (easily top 5 of all books, graphic novel or not). It is the type of book that will invade your thoughts for weeks after you have finished it.<br />It is a beautiful and heart wrenching depiction of a teenager coming to terms with, among so many other things, a love that she does not understand. If the story does not do it for you then the art will; it both acts as the perfect compliment to the overall tone and message of the book, and is gorgeous from cover to cover.<br /><br />A book has not left me this thoroughly satisfied in a long time.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|I hate it so boring and star wars is dumb in the first place and if u think is awesome well u have no life
075669812X|5.0|I got these for two of my nephews for christmas who are six years old. They loved it when they opened it.  They proceeded to read it and discuss the book together.  It was a nice touch to add a lego guy with the book. Overall great buy that promotes reading.
B00C5R8364|4.0|an intersting story well written as usual from Forsyth. however about half way through you could pretty much<br />see where it was going. It was still well worth the read.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The app itself is fine but it seems to be tied into a game of some sort because I get notices about earning rewards &amp; accomplishments being reached. Otherwise love the app!
B00919CI5Q|4.0|I really like this graphic card<br /><br />I have a mini ITX rig and it fit perfectly and the power consumption isnt big so its perfect for me<br /><br />Incredibly low noise and low temperatures compared to my previous 560ti twin frozr
B006OCM0G0|4.0|fantastic graphics, fun, engaging. I like the pace of the game, not so slow that you have wait forever to do anything.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Love this it's a lot of fun an  very interactive.  Good system for progressing.  Wish it had son  nor  language options though, like japanese
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This is a really scary movie. The theater where I go is close by house is Tinsel Town, they have a really good sound system and they love to turn crank it up, especially when scary movies are showing.  All throughout movie, you could hear men as well as women screaming, I think I screamed on a couple scenes or two myself. The special effects weren't bad either. Although Mama is typical ghost story; kind of predicable if you know I mean, but is better then most ghost movies that's been produce lately.<br /><br /> Con: The part I had problem with in the movie was the scene in the beginning with dad I felt the writers could have kept it out. Other then that scene for me; its really good movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|5 stars<br />Thanks to Stephen king for taking his constant readers on a long awaited visit back to one of his most memorable families. The trip was more than worth the wait. This novel just brings to light the genius behind those glasses, leading his readers back to the beginning and the time in between that lets reader walk in Danny's life and visit the demons that shaped the man he became.<br />Thanks again,<br />Your number 1 fan
B003L77G2Y|4.0|Not as good as the masterful work that is seasons 1 & 2...but hell it gets pretty darn close. Get ready for another wild ride with Fringe season 3. Wisely the show more and more places Walter & Peter at the center of the story and allows them to do the heavy lifting. Anna Torv is a good actress, but lacks the raw talent of the mad scientist & the quack attack.
B00F4FGC0S|3.0|Very psychedelic offering from these guys. Some really cool tracks but some underlying darkness to the while album makes it a bit of a drag.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|What an amazing pilot and overall first season. As good as a first season as I have ever seen. Most syfy type shows take 2 seasons to really find themselves(Buffy, Supernatural, etc)...but this show really knows who and what it is. Fringe delivers the goods all of the weird and cool science stuff you can handle and while all wrapping it up into a very intriguing plot that sucks you right in.<br /><br />No Anna Torv is no Sarah Michelle Gellar...but in the long run the series makes a wise move shifting the story towards Dr. Bishop & Peter.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is very easy to use and is extremely accurate. However, this calculator should also be able to be a scientific calculator. Square roots and fractions, you know. Otherwise it was great!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I just finished this for the third time.  It gets better every time. I still haven't decided if I'll see the movie or not.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game involves much thinking and is very fun.  It is very challenging and the game cleverly uses common items for your escape.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a book. My first book by this author. I was sucked in from the first page. This book is about murder and how far would you go to protect a loved one. It also ask the question nature versus nurture . I think I will read more from this author.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|If anyone felt like me in recent years, I've been made more aware of this new found abundance of natural gas resource buried underneath North America. Plentiful and cheap, I thought maybe the US could level the playing field with the oil exporting countries, and all the bad politics, war, terrorism that goes with our dependency.<br /><br />But, after wathing this, I was disheartened. Yes, we there is a vast supply of natural gas to be tapped, but process to access it is less than simple, or non-invasive. Hydrolic Fracturing aka &#34;Fracking&#34; is causing a great deal of contamination to drinking water supplies for those citizens living near these well sites. Check out the driking water coming out of the tap that can be lit on fire.... say no more.. it's complicated.  Good documentary.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This is a decent book and can really be summed by implore the reader to live in the present tense.
B008PZZUTS|5.0|Great movie.Great story. Great plot. Great suspense. Just my kind of movie! I recommend this film to people who like mystery and suspense movies.
B007Z1FD7M|5.0|Always is good find some rare or hidden footage of your favorite bands and better when the line-up is your favorite. On that way this material is spectacular. The double trio in Argentina. I think why I didn't was there. I find this double DVD as an important document for the fans of Robert Fripp and his gang. Sadly video quality is really poor, but in case of KC, audio is what really matters!.
B0020BUWX2|3.0|I really liked the idea of this book. It was nothing like I had ever read before. But it had a lot of swear words and vulgar talk. I think it could have been an amazing book, if those things had been left out. Also, not to spoil the ending, but it ended real abrupt and kind of left you hanging as to what she did. Almost like, they didn't know how to end it, so they just stopped.
B001O8C5EQ|5.0|I have been discovering to PT from the most recent to the oldest material, and every time I found myself very fascinated. This album of 1996 is really great. That heavy sound mixed with melodic riffs take the best of the metal and prog. Rock.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|BEST GAME EVER hands down! I wish they did not charge for the full version but it is what it is. It's an awesome and addictive game :)
B00CTGVKGQ|5.0|Just when I thought music was dead Lorde comes and makes me believe again. And at only 16 she is very talented. Just out of this world amazing.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|The tradition in our house is to watch Full Metal Jacket after graduating from  Marine Corp boot camp. Marine Corp certainly has changed alot but it is still the baddest!
1594204217|5.0|i don't really want to write x number of words, the five stars should do it. If you like to cook, if you are interested in the science behind  cooking and recipes, BUY THIS BOOK1 You can thank me later.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great form beginning to end. None stop action. I would recommend to a friend. Five star movie. Will watch it again.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|I'm a terrible critic for anything KOL does because my ears have never heard a bad song by this band. This band is perfection. Caleb Followill's voice is as earthy and strong as it's ever been. I'm so relieved they are back in all their excellent glory!!!! This album is awesome!
B0043UB0EI|5.0|If you liked 300 or just like Roman themed shows. Than this is the show for you. Love the plot and actors. Can't wait to see the rest of the sequels.
B00EDPFJA4|3.0|I like Drake and I'm not 100% on why. This album sounds a lot like the two former ones. But this kid is a lyricist all day long!!!! Plus I'm still shocked when Baby pops up randomly on a track of his. Either way good album. He's very talented. Loved it. \\"Started from the bottom\\" is still stuck in my brain from summer.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I am a huge fan of QOTSA and I stand by my headline!  This album shows the incredible range of Josh Homme, from the more upbeat songs like \\"Smooth sailing\\" and \\"My God is the sun\\" to the sad, dark, but beautiful songs like \\"The Vampyre of Time and Memory\\" and \\"...Like Clockwork\\".<br />If you like real music, get this album or any other Josh Homme product such as Them Crooked Vultures or even The Eagles of Death Metal.  In my opinion, QOTSA are the best current rock band and one of the absolute best bands ever, and even better live.
B00DPKQ60A|4.0|I get stuck watching nick with my 8 yr old. I've seen this kid on \\"Victorious\\" and now \\" Sam & Cat\\" a million times. Who knew this girl could sing!!!!! Wow. All the divas need to watch out! Mariah to Christina Aguilera! The duet with \\"The Wanted's\\" Nathan Sykes is simply mind-blowing! This girl has quite the bright future ahead with pipes like that! Great album.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It is so fun but I tried to download the beach course and the game will not open again<br />,
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Book held my attention, but you eventually catch on to the Connelly formula of running thru several suspects until the more obscure guilty party finally surfaces.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|the sleep mode isn't quite accurate. I've gotten up for and hour or more and it still records light sleep.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Oh my gosh! I LOVE this story!  I laughed and cried. This is no light reading... very emotional, but I loved every page.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|A thrilling movie all around!  An interesting plot line, with a few riveting twists.  We didn't see the ending coming!
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|okay, but like the book better
B008Y6MKSW|5.0|Saw this again and thought it was great.  The movie has really aged well and it isn't as dated as I thought it would be - fashion aside.  Would definitely recommend this movie.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Needed a good app to review and update Microsoft files.  This apps works good and although does not have all office functions,it permits me to do minor changes which is really all I was looking for.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There are no words to describe this series, it is truly amazing. The books are well written, the characters well developed, the romance was written in such a way that you feel you are living it along with them. I've read this series more than once and i don't think i'll ever stop wanting to read them. It gives you a message of what we humans are capable of and what we could lose, our humanity, our soul if we don't do something now and even then, we could still make mistakes purely out of ambition. Everybody should read this books, like now!

It's still awesome, i like it even more than before. The wait will be torture since they'll split this book in 2 parts. I imagine that part 1 will be before the part called \\"the assassin\\" begins and part 2 will be all \\"the assassin\\" but who knows they may surprise us
B009R659L8|5.0|Kept you in suspense until the end. Always enjoy Mary HIggins Clark's books. Couldn't' put the book down as I wanted to know who did it.
B00846REIS|4.0|Wow, i must say wow. I had just finished reading the fifty shades series when i started this one and let me say it truly surprised, i don't know why but i kind of liked Gideon a little bit more that Christian. Although they are both seriously hot and alpha dominant males. I liked that Eva had more character, she was a stronger heroine and i liked a lot better. Yes, the story felt similar, but this series got into a different category and i like that very much.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The first experiment only took 20 minutes to happen!!!  I went out to get my mail, and got something I was not expecting!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Mmmmm, where to start? I thought this was the last book, guess i was wrong. The book was well written it keeps you intrigued, however, it gives more questions than answers and new mysteries, which is ok, but i'm afraid the author is trying to drag the story, is kind of working now, but i'm not sure it will once book 4 and 5 are out, everybody knows life doesn't have a HEA, but when you read a book you kind of want to live in the fantasy that somebody (even fictional) is having one. The characters deserve one.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|AS a Star Trek fan this is most interesting, I started looking at it when it first came out, but missed several episodes, so this is great for me.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this sequel! I want a Gideon for myself, like now, where can i find one? *sigh*. Anyway, i liked the story, there was a lot of angst, suspense, hot and steamy sex and heartbreak. Gideon was his old self and he managed me to love him even more. Eva also grew and she managed to voice her opinions a lot better.

I love this series and i just hope the movie is at least 60% good from the book. Can't wait to see Finnick.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|While this movie is enjoyable, it does have the hints of being aimed at a younger audience (I'm fourteen and I felt this way.)<br />The feeling that you get while watching that is of watching the Barbie movies, like The Nutcracker.<br /><br />That being said, for a film of such a genre, it's really good. It has an antagonist of which we're not sure if she's redeemable or not, and having been \\"The Star Pupil Of Princess Celestia\\" it makes her a very interesting character. Of course her having Snips and Snails as her henchman is still brinking on ridiculous. (Hey, didn't Trixie already do that?)<br /><br />I feel this movie really does prove Twilight as a girl who can overcome any obstacle, which I believe is a good lesson. With a little faith, anything is possible.<br />Also, I think it's great that they put in friendships that had to be patched! I related to it very much, and I believe that a lot of people do! Having friends is hard, but worth it!<br /><br />All in all it's an excellent movie, that was just a liiiiiiiittle lacking. I wish it had been a little longer, and more had been explained about Twilight's romance and the history between the five of the Mane 6 at Canterlot high.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use evernote for everything. I can't imagine my life now without it. Very easy to use, and I love that I can sync it with my evernote on my laptop.

B001NLL93W|5.0|The story didn't disappoint me a little bit. It just keeps getting better as the books progress. Can't wait to see the movie that comes out for it.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Life and history seem to stumble along. Packed with wry and often black humour. Rated SLT (contains material that made me smile, laugh and think).
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It over rides the movie and makes the story so much better. I prefer the book instead of the movie even. Fell in love with the characters and enjoyed the read.
B00AGYM0DU|5.0|I just finished reading this wonderful book. A teenage Japanese girl's struggle to find a place in the world.<br />The story is often sad, confronting, heartbreaking and tragic. However, this is met with humour, principle, wisdom, bravery and the spiritual and mystical elements of the story.<br />Just fantastic.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|I am definitely going to be loooking for more written by this author! I am a teacher and taught a child a few years ago who was diagnosed as having a touch of Asperger's Syndrome. I saw so much of him in the main character! I loved every page and could not stop reading!
B009K0OL06|5.0|This is a very engaging drama, well done with a thrilling script that leaves you hanging on every episode.  Watched five one night, from 10 until 2 am.  Wife is addicted, as well!

B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was great fun. The back story is well thought out and I love how you have added the idea of a crime board and timeline where you can place and rearrange the evidence you collect.If you love mystery, puzzles and hidden object games you can't go wrong with this one well worth the money. CAN'T WAIT FOR THESE GUYS TO MAKE PART TWO!!!!!!!!
B0067RQYNW|4.0|If you are looking for a good program to use instead of getting Microsoft 365 this program is it. Use it all the time for basic needs
B006LG7GIQ|3.0|The movie was good with the camera, lighting, props and the acting as well so 3 out of 5 because I really wasn't doing it for me in that I was not too wild about the film. The film was not one I usually watch like action or comedy movies.
B00785P2QC|2.0|It's an alright game, kinda boring though.I don't like that you can't rotate the buildings and stuff costs too much!

B008TVLRU4|5.0|Has an active table of contents and a comprehensive introduction to Marcus Arelius and Stoicism. The content is excellent. Eloquent musings on a virtuous life.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Do you like the fast zombies of [[ASIN:B00C4QLIJK 28 Days Later]] / [[ASIN:B002NWOI0G Dawn of the Dead]] or the traditional slow zombies of [[ASIN:B001ENHNJS Night Of The Living Dead]] / [[ASIN:B0049P1VHS The Walking Dead]]? I'll take my zombies however they're given to me. But if you're particular about your zombies and you like them traditionally \\"undead\\" versus the rage-disease pandemic style zombies, then you might have a bone to pick with World War Z. I've seen some passionate zombie fans scream bloody murder if you even call a rage-diseased person a zombie. \\"Zombies are only people that have died and come back to life,\\" the naysayers will tell you. WWZ takes care of the issue by knocking down a human for about 12 seconds before coming back as a zombie without ever really explaining whether or not the person actually \\"died\\" before coming back as a fast-rage-undead-zombie. Hence undead and rage fans should equally enjoy WWZ....<br /><br />...Until mid-way through the movie. The first half of the move is very well done actually. The zombies are some of the most terrifying that I've ever seen. Brad Pitt is a former United Nations investigator. When the world is suddenly turned upside-down by a rapidly spreading zombie infection, Pitt is reluctantly recommissioned and travels the world trying to find the source to potentially find \\"a cure.\\" The initial outbreak scenes are awesome. Pitt plus family's escape from a city gone mad is wild. And Pitt traveling from country to country to find the source is vicious-zombie-filled and thoroughly entertaining. Then comes \\"the crash.\\"<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of spoilers, so I'll just use the aforementioned \\"crash\\" reference to indicate the point in the movie where a jump the shark moment occurs taking the movie from believably great to unbelievably gimme-a-break territory. Once the movie jumped the shark it became not only silly at times but also predictable.<br /><br />So all in all the movie is half great, half not so great resulting in a 3-star flick. Worth checking out, but check your brain at about the 75 minute mark.reat resulting in a 3-star flick. Worth checking out, but check your brain at about the 75 minute mark.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie, I went to the movies like 3 times to watch it, combining all the super herod was great and the actors did agreat job
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Read this for a book group.  Even with death as the narrator, it took a long time, about half the book, to get my attention. After that I had a hard time putting the book down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An excellent read with bits of everything...romance, happiness, sadness, triumph and failure. I Will definitely retread this amazing book again!
0316212261|5.0|I loved this when I first read it. I had borrowed it and after sending it back I HAD to get my own set. This set was fantastic!
B00AF6B22E|4.0|There are a lot of reviews on this and I am not giving away any of the movie. We saw this in the theater and knew then that we would get it on disk. This pack is a bonus as it has DVD, Blue Ray and UltraViolet. When I ordered it we only had the DVD player but then I got a deal on a blue ray and I had my copy of Flight to watch. It has great graphics and except for the opening scene I enjoyed it a lot. I recommend this to everyone except you should NOT let children watch this.
0399255370|1.0|Anita Klein<br /><br />Based on the rave reviews I thought this would be fantastic.  Now I'm just really confused by all those good reviews???  The crayons basically dump their unhappy thoughts on this poor  kid Duncan (using some pretty harsh words to do so)  one crayon even criticizes his coloring abilities (staying within the lines).  The entire book is page after page of negative letters written to this child. Finally at the end you get a full spread of a picture Duncan has colored in reponse to all the complaints.  I'm assuming the point is to encourage creativity?  That rainbows can be black etc.  But if you look at the finished picture you see that Duncan has just pretty much drawn what was demanded of him by the crayons. Where is the creativity in that?  Far to negative in my opinion to read to your kids ( especially for preschool and kindergarten).  I'd say purchase  The Dot by Peter H. Reynolds if you want to inspire your child to be creative. That is a fantastic book!
B004Q0SQ24|5.0|My son loves playing with his wooden Chuggington trains.  They are hard to find anywhere so we started ordering them from Amazon and they are cheap and arrive in the mail quickly.  He is so excited to get a new one and they are good quality and fit on his train table he already had.  I just wish we could find more Chuggington items!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is a book that you could probably read in three or four long sessions.  It is fast paced and quite frankly, a little depressing.  But definately makes you think about how life is so fragile and how fleeting it can be.  Although it could have had a little more depth, it really seems to tap into the teen-age psyche.  The characters are likable, although again, more depth would have been appreciated.  But a good, easy, thoughtful read.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  As I was reading the book, I found myself wondering what I would do with the challenges each character faced.  In some cases, I would not have chosen the direction the author chose for the characters. Read for yourself and see what you think.  This book is a light and easy read.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|what can i say this game sucks big time it does not respond to controls graphic suck response to game use suck the game suck i guess thats why its a free app, buyer beware do not buy or down load this app.

B0040I09RM|5.0|This show was not what I expected at all. I really thought it was about old white men riding bikes living away from society trying to preserve their golden years. Boy was I wrong. This show is like new jack city meets scarface meets the god father who then meets training day. Lol. I watched all 5 seasons in one week!!! I was totally hooked.  You actually see each character develop and you can actually relate to their plight in some strange way. You kind of start rooting for the characters although socially and morally there actions need to be condemned. Definitely more graphic and explicit than any show I have ever scene. At one point I thought this must be the unedited version.  But nope  FX is the new HBO for cable. Lol. Just started watching the new season 6 and it is very graphic as well.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|It is very cute. I am glad I tried it out. I just wish I had more time for it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I enjoyed the book very  much.  It is a a great read. Well done it kept me intrigued through the whole book.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It is very cute I enjoyed it for quite a while. It is really hard the faster you are going. The only thing is I would have feed back on is that you should have practice rounds like in Dumb Ways to Live so you could understand it more and get the hang of it.
0385523394|1.0|The book is great, does not glamorize prison, but shows human side of prison life.  The people in prison are not monsters, but people who have made poor choices, and recognize it.  Piper humanized the situation and gave every individual person credit for what they did right and deemphasized what they did wrong.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Solid acting and suspense filled action thriller start to finish...worth watching again!  Some transition problems, but strong acting helps you focus on a thought provoking premise.
B00F35BV64|3.0|tedious and predictable.  better than no movie but looked more like someones desire to get another sequel out to satisfy an imagined pent up need.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|The thing I love about this flick is it's ability to weave the different stories though out time while maintaining separate cinematography and production through out each time period.  Great performances all around from a stellar cast and good direction too.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Talk about a thin plot line and total junk story and really we are supposed to believe those 2 are happily married??? How many movies do we have to see where the annoying kids take over and cause mischief and mayhem because the little brats won't listen to the parents or might die because they forgot their inhaler. Total garbage.
B005G48Y58|5.0|What I get out of this movie is not all the action, which it does carry the right amount, nor is it's fantastic score by the Chemical Brothers.  I love this movie because for the very last thing Eric Banner's character says.  It sums up the whole movie perfectly.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This edition has many extras and the picture and sound quality are fantastic.  Plus it is a love story if it does take time getting there.  But it is a film you must have if not for the music then the visuals.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I happen to LOVE these headphones!  I used to get them from Target years ago, for around $9-11.  And I've gone through over 2 dozen pair!  And that is no lie!  I love them because they fit nicely in my ears, and they work very well in a busy work environment.  I can still hear the music, and still be aware of folks talking around me.  And, they've always cost around $10.  So, if they last 3-6 months, it's cool.  I would just pick up another pair at the local store.  My job can be pretty physical (lot's of running around), so I try not to spend too much on headphones.  I get it, the cheap ones don't last long.  But, I bought two of the EXACT MODEL Sony headphones from Amazon in Feb 2013, and they cost under $10 each.  I bought two because they don't last very long, but I love the way they sound and fit.  But, I now see that they sell for OVER $40!!!!!!!!  Not cool.  If these are truly an improvement, they had better last at least two years, given the price.  In the meantime, I'll be looking elsewhere for the next headphone gem. PASS!!!!!!!!
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|This is quite a good movie and nice to see other actors I like in these roles.  Some part may be a little too violent for some but not too bad at all.  A great finish at the end.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|I found the album to be an excellent choice for listening while working out. No doubt, Ozzy's got it down...
B003VS0CXS|5.0|The visuals are truly outstanding and Blu-ray brings out all the beauty of the castle and countryside.  The castle is actually Neuschwanstein castle built between 1869 and 1886 for the Bavarian King Ludwig II and used as the castle for Walt Disney.

B0017OB12O|5.0|This Blu-ray Collector’s Edition has a lot of extras that are just fantastic.  I have never seen it in 2.55:1 ratio and the picture and sound quality are amazing.  This was one of my uncle’s favorite movies and it is a must for all people interested in WWII films.
B001GSTOAM|5.0|Uncle Bob has an amazing style and lot of experience. I can use the knowledge from the book very well.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This is a classic movie showing the future bright and hopeful with science and space travel being pushed to the frontiers.  It is also a love story and Leslie Nielson gives an outstanding and professional performance as the commander of his crew.  It shows he can be a serious actor.  The Blu-ray comes with many extras including The Invisible Boy which is a sequel to Forbidden Planet and not to be missed.
B00E6895M6|5.0|Been listening to everything that has been put onto YouTube from Live performances to more official music videos and could not wait until the album finally released. Now that I have it in hand I can vouch that it is every bit as good as expected. My favorite tracks coming in were Lies #1 , Mother we share, Now is not the time, Recover and Gun but honestly \\"We Sink\\" is quickly growing on me as a top contender. Lauren is a goddess with smarts, talent and a cool snide humor I like but Lain and Martin are equal parts to the success of this group with great potential. Another reviewer made a comment \\"audio crack\\" and i could not agree more, pure addiction to this sound. Comparisons have been made to other bands but I find Chvrches to be unique, quality sound that seems to be pushing music forward into another era.<br />  Strange that when I hear a bit of imperfection in the sound I quickly think it is something that they will get better at, they just came out with their first full record today after all. This is a false notion though as I think I like the raw sound and the Live performances partially for the small imperfections. This leaves me wondering why but all I can say is I like them so much now that I doubt I could become a bigger fan. Somehow they have made me a believer early on and I can only wish them the best success!<br />  Buy this CD and support them on tour my friends, they deserve it.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|I saw this in a packed theater when it first came out and when it was finally released on Blu-ray from the 70mm print in its original 2.2-:1 aspect ratio I had to add it to my collection.  This was one of my dad’s favorite movies as he served in WWII and had friends who served under General Patton.
B003VANOFY|1.0|This headset is absolutely perfect except for one thing. My battery doesn't hold a charge, even while plugged in. So, now, it's basically just a expensive paperweight.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|This movie was a treasure in the theatres in the 1980’s and finally on Blu-ray it really stands out and looks great.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Movie expands upon the prequel already shown using the same actors who are fitting into the roles very well.  Great computer animation and sound effects... .
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great movies and great screen resolutions. Use it in my ps3 and it plays great on my tv. Notice it the most when i watch the Dark Knight and the aerial shots of the city look amazing. great movies and great picture.

0385743564|5.0|Brandon Sanderson takes an idea - what if the world had superpowered beings and that they were all evil - and runs with it to create a wonderfully tight and engaging story.<br /><br />Mind you - this is a title directed to young adults.  It's designed to be episodic, fast-paced, and easily digested.  (If you are looking for 19 volumes of 900+ pages per book detailing the 50 years of history of the third spear carrier on the left - go see Jordan or RR Martin.)<br /><br />One third of a way through this book, I wanted to play in the Champions or Mutants and Masterminds game set in it.  Two thirds of the way through the book I wanted to see it in Imax.
B00F2J2LRE|5.0|From the opening notes of \\"Woman's World\\" it's clear that Cher is picking up right where she left off with [[ASIN:B00000F1D3 Believe]] and [[ASIN:B00005V9TX Living Proof]]; creating hard driving electronic dance music aimed squarely at her current core of fans.  To say that Cher is a survivor or reinvents herself with great frequency is understatement and here Cher is reaffirming her reputation as the premier dance diva on today's dance floors.  It's hard to believe [[ASIN:B00005V9TX Living Proof]], her last studio album came out over ten years ago, and \\"Closer to the Truth\\" picks up right where Cher left off.  \\"Take It Like A Man\\" keeps the pace going and points out Cher isn't going to slow down but keep the beats coming. The use of auto-tuning keeps Cher solidly contemporary and it's quickly clear there will be numerous singles and remixes from \\"Closer to the Truth.\\"  This is exactly the kind of album Cher fans were praying for.  While she'll pay homage to her past hits in concert its clear Cher isn't looking back but very much in the here and now.  \\"My Love\\" slows things down only slightly and honestly it's a beautiful moving song, not exactly something you'd expect on so dance-oriented an album.  \\"Dressed to Kill\\" and \\"red\\" are both nice up-tempo numbers in her usual milieu of love, loss, regret, and anger.  \\"Lovers Forever\\" has this grand orchestral almost Pet Shop Boys sounding grandeur and sweep that I feel in love with.  Perhaps a bit too retro for a single though.  \\"I Walk Alone\\" has a weird banjo opening and feels almost country despite the relentlessly thumping backbeat.  Admittedly it's a bit of an odd fit, somewhat akin to her version of \\"Walking in Memphis\\" as it just doesn't fit her. \\"Sirens\\" is oddly slow, moving, and affecting...an odd track that works so very well, giving quiet spaces for Cher to show off her amazing vocals.  It very well could be my favorite track from the album.  \\"Favorite Scars\\" almost seems to be autobiographical and tends towards the most rock-oriented track here.  Everyone once in a while there's a song that really resonates on a profoundly personal level and \\"I Hope You Find It\\" is just that.  Ostensibly it's singer wishing well to someone they loved, hoping they will find the best in life, but I also get the sense it's an internalized wish as well.  Heaven knows I can think of people I've loved and sent on their way and vice versa and this seems to neatly capture that sentiment minus the heavy dance beats.  In a similar vein \\"Lie to Me\\" closes out the disk and in 41 minutes and change Cher has taken you on an emotional roller coaster ride.  To be sure, Cher is for romantics and the dance floor crowd. If you think she's still the funky \\"Dark Lady\\" of the 70s or the brash rocker of the 80s you're sadly mistaken.  Cher is ready for the 21st Century and beyond!  I don't honestly know what happened to Cher in recent years, but all I know is I like it!rds the most rock-oriented track here.

B007V65R54|3.0|The Signal and the Noise, by Nate Silver, tells us that Bayesian reasoning allows us to make better predictions than other methods.  In this reasoning idea, which is based on a mathematical formula, one takes a prior possibility and compares it to a new event and obtains a posterior possibility.  This is where x equals the prior possibility, y equals a new event probability that is false, and Z equals a new event probability that is true.  The posterior possibility is xy over xy plus z (x-1).  The net result is a probability.  The author is convinced that this almost metaphysical approach to forecasting the future is far better than others because it takes into account the possibility that the world is uncertain.<br /><br />Mr. Silver makes a big deal out of certain comparisons.  For example, he says those using theories that ignore uncertainty are like hedgehogs tend to be certain (they know one big thing) while those using Bayesian reasoning are like foxes and more flexible even if less certain (they know many small things).  Unfortunately, Mr. Silver thinks he is a fox - and openly and proudly says so - but his reasoning displays his hedgehog brain.  Only an inflexible and very certain hedgehog type would classify people into two categories and then name off the traits that each of the two groups possesses.  A fox would naturally divide people into several groups, each with many flexible traits, depending on how they reacted to different situations.  By limiting himself to two categories Mr. Silver is clearly a hedgehog type, and this is a type his doesn't like.  Thus, his reasoning is rather odd.<br /><br />The math approach to forecasting or predicting is interesting; however, the Bayesian idea is based on the ability of a person to guess a probability which itself is a guess.  Yes, the world is uncertain and a lot of errors take place when people think they know more than they do and put bets on the future based on imperfect knowledge; however, when I put a number on the probability of a prior possibility it is a guess based on almost nothing.  If any of my guesses in the Bayesian formula are way off then everything is way off including the posterior possibility.  Even if I have a huge amount of experience in war gaming, for example, my numbers concerning a prior possibility or the false or true condition of a new event are guesses and nothing else.  Will my enemy attack at point X on the next turn?  No matter how I calculate it, it is only a guess.  The underlying condition of the Bayesian method is a guess on top of a guess.  That does not add any certainty to the world (as he claims).<br /><br />At least his methods avoids trying to read the mind of another person, which is a constant error.  If one listens to the talk TV show hosts one would think we can read the minds of the leaders of Iraq.  If we do X in Syria then Iraq will think Y.  Completely nuts.  Chamberlain thought he could read the mind of Hitler.  Roosevelt thought he could read the mind of the Japanese.  Both were terribly wrong and their guesses led to horrible results.  In fact, in international affairs one can never guess at the mind of the opponent.  It isn't chess.  One is not limited to a certain number of moves or choices.  As Mr. Silver points out, the world is filled with uncertainty and some things may, in fact, not be predictable to any appreciable degree.<br /><br />AD2mber on the probability of a prior possibility it is a guess based on almost nothing.

B004EPZ084|5.0|Everyone told me this was a great movie, and it was!.  I think what makes this movie the best is the script, it was well written.  Hard to go wrong with this one.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|This was one of the most banal and unengaging movies I have ever seen.  Of course, I couldn't stand to watch the whole thing.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I really like Firefly and the follow-up movie, Serenity. Which is unexpected for me. I am a fan of the science fiction, don't get me wrong - but I remember when it debuted on TV and I tried to watch it, but was unable to follow it. Then the movie came out and I thought, &#34;why bother?&#34;<br /><br />I was wrong. The series was not aired in the proper order when it was originally broadcast, so anyone would have a hard time with viewing it. I found it online, presented in the order originally intended. I watched every episode and then the movie. I now do this very often because it really is/was a great show.<br /><br />Character development, cast's interaction with each other, story arc - all just great stuff. I highly recommend this series.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Such a great season!  I love the show and it couldn't get any better.  I Can't wait for next season.
0790738074|5.0|Love it. Was more than I expected it to be. Couldn't have been a better pick in Robert Preston to accompany Shirley Jones who is simply wonderful as Marian.
B00957T6X6|5.0|When I was young, I loved all day lollipops that took forever to disappear (though my dentist didn't). Now I love books that take a very very long time to read. (Dentist has no comment on that.) Been working on this Kindle set for a couple of months and still only partway through. Such a well-written story with appealing characters, vivid narration, and now and then an incredibly disturbing violent scene that makes me so very grateful that I chose not to watch the TV series. The only caveat I have on this particular version of this set of novels is, one needs to be very careful to set a bookmark at each stopping place. It is possible to lose your place and have trouble finding it again. With all the very good reviews that have been written about this series and the excellent descriptions provided by other readers here, I don't feel obligated to say anything specific about the content, but simply to recommend these books without any reservations whatever. A grand grand story well and thoroughly told. Martin is one of those writers who stops writing a story only when he's well and truly done with it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I hadn't seen one episode of DA until about a month ago.  I had to catch up on the first three seasons to be ready for the new Season 4.  After one episode I was hooked!! Great Cast,storyline(though tragic at times) ,plots,scenery,etc. I love how you are involved in all different perspectives and several levels of storyline. I found myself feeling &#34;at times&#34; that I was actually a part of them.  Brilliant! Now I know why I was urged to watch it..and now I am the one urging others to!  So glad you now have a new season coming up...You must continue this one for many seasons to come!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Being a Beatles fan from way back, I was pretty sure I would love this collection from my \\"favorite Beatle\\" even before I heard it. And I'm happy to report that I do. This is kind of a laid back and mellow album with songs like \\"It's Only a Paper Moon\\", \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\\" and \\"Always\\". I was glad to see that \\"Valentine\\" was also included. I like that song. I'm happy that McCartney is still writing and singing songs. It's easy to see from this collection how much he still enjoys it. And I certainly enjoy listening to him!
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|Love Leo. This was a very creative take on an American classic novel. it was interesting to see a mixture of the times from then  to now. Plus it ha a very interesting mix of music.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Why not five stars?  The book is too long as Hugo goes on and on far too often.  He says in 100 words what he could have said in ten.  That being said, it is a marvelous book, with a social perspective as true today as ever.  Every one of our political representatives should read this book, especially the very end, in which Hugo explains that the book is as pertinent for all other countries as it was for France and in which he comments on the bloated military budgets versus those of education.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Rihanna has yet to disappoint me. I love all her albums. Unapologetic is differently my second favorite album of her's now.

B00B8R1NP0|2.0|I usually read several books every week, and I have to say &#34;Time Killer&#34; is one of the most poorly written books I have read in ages.  The conversations were quite stilted and certain words were used too often within a sentence or two.  The killer's reasons were explained over and over, as if we readers weren't expected to understand after reading it once.  Sometimes I felt like I was reading a comic book!<br /><br />I don't generally write reviews, but I felt compelled to warn others not to bother with this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it really draws you into it like you are actually one of the characters. I don't know if that is crazy or not but, maybe I'm fifty shades of screwed up too!!! Best book ever!!!! I would recommend to everyone !

B004EPYZU8|5.0|I have read a lot of reviews over this kind of movie. Yes at first, it's going to be a little hard to understand the meaning of the movie. Had to each it 2 in order to understand the movie. The cool part about it was the action part. Nice effects, cool music and pretty good cast. Many don't like it, but I'm cool with it. Think about it this way. We all have friends, some are like family to us. Few of our friends are willing to sacrifice themselves just to see you succeed something better in life. That same analogy applies to this movie. If you watch this movie with this kind of mind thinking, you will understand what the movie is all about. Hope this helps.

B00F91H666|5.0|the zombies didn't just stumble around like those old corny movies.  Lot's of action.  Only thing I couldn't figure?  If they turn so fast, how could they get to America?
B005LAIIN0|1.0|My god this is dull. How something so frenetic can be so boring is a mystery. You hardly ever get a good look at an actual zombie -- they mostly just look like a bunch of drunken fans after a Stanley cup win. There's no suspense. Face it: Brad Pitt isn't going to get eaten, and you can pretty much predict when the next solo zombie is going to pop up. The world is overrun after the first 10 minutes of the movie, so there isn't even any drama related to that. Any single episode of The Walking Dead is 20 times more enjoyable. I can't think of a zombie movie that I haven't liked better, and it's not like I'm a gore hound or anything. [[ASIN:B0025VLEM0 Shaun of the Dead [Blu-ray]]] was better. [[ASIN:B000ZL5ACW Fido]] was better.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|i play this on face book quite often so when i saw in on my kindle I immediately down loaded it. Its a good game. it is challenging and helps pass the time.
B00CE0ZY46|5.0|Great show for kids.  Adults who liked Chicken Run, etc will enjoy it too.  We very highly recommend this show.
B0091XICM0|5.0|Out of the three King Kongs, this one, the original is by far the best. Considering it is 80 years old the special effect still hold up very well.  Classic movie!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I love this film because I love the performances of all the actors. Each performance is of star quality. The music is memorable and enhances the evocative quality of the diffrences betwen the old rich and the newly rich. Although friendly on a superficial basis, the rich will quickly lose interest and show they have the money and the power and only need themselves. Passion and obsession is the theme.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|but it seems to be more tragic, more of a soap opera, my wife still likes it more than I.
B00B2LPYNE|5.0|I have always been a fan of Hatebreed. This album does not disappoint. It stands up to even their classic albums.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun. The bingo is fast, colorful, and entertaining. The slots are just as much fun. You'll be addicted in no time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Better to start when you don't need a full night's sleep. Difficult to put down. Seemed like a classic good/evil tale at first, but Howey delivers something much more nuanced.
B00C32R64G|4.0|The title pretty much says it all in this one. Volbeat has a unique vocalist and an excellent rock vibe. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Volbeat or just good rock music in general.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Although some might see it's your typical rags to (somewhat) riches story - kind of in the same light as  &#34;How Starbucks Saved My Life&#34; it was a touching story. I do think this title was priced quite high by the publisher, although some consolation can be had by knowing who a percentage of the profits are hopefully benefiting.<br />This would be an excellent read on an E-book device while flying across the Atlantic to visit London.
0694003611|5.0|My daughter is nearly 2yo and for bedtime we do anywhere between 1-4 books depending on how tired she is. This one is always towards the end of the list, really helps her settle and she enjoys pointing at and naming things she recognises in the pictures and saying \\"shh\\" then whispering at the end. I I often see her looking at this book during the day on her own. When she brings it to me to read she calls it \\"a cow meh meh meh moon.\\" I agree with others who have said there's something special abut this book, it seems so simple but it certainly struck a chord with my girl.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|The first 2 dvd's in this series seemed disjointed; artificial.  The characterization seemed spotty and did not flow like parts 1 and 2 series did.  I was disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I loved the app until it was hacked around 10 months later. I can't say it was the creators of this app that had done it because I don't know who it was. The hacker seemed to enjoy making me frustrated. Leaving texts on my timeline too foul to repeat,  deleting photos, cursing out my friends, blocking my best friends and then unlocking people who I had blocked. They had access even after I changed my password five times!!!They texted my address and some private info. I don't have any enemies so it has to be someone (I don't know )who's getting thrills off of frustrating others. I am now afraid of any kind of interaction with Facebook because of this.
B0045IZW9W|5.0|this Fo*ken album has been a great purchase as I love every track on the thing, with the exception of one. I'll let you figure out which one, bit*h!!

Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job with this book!<br /><br />If you read this, please be sure to have the other two books on hand - you can't read one without reading the other two!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Have been a treky for a while, so of course it was good. I love how the new movies tie in with the original Star Trek.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent series for all to enjoy and appreciate. Great attention to detail for the period both costumes and social structure.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The plot is scandalous but always has an unexpected twist involved. The court room action really brings in the viewer and provides fantastic additional drama.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|A powerful little book on life with cancer and the inner thoughts of a person facing death. Even though Hitchens (who has since died) was one of the world's most well-known atheists who mercilessly bashed religion and religious people, this his last book is relatively kind and does not spend many pages on arguments against God's existence. Even though some will not like the book or not be able to finish it because it's so morbid and painful to read, I believe that what Hitchens shares needs to be heard. We have so cleaned up and sanitized the reality of death and dying that Hitchens' words are a needed raw expression of what really happens and what goes on inside one's mind. The quote that struck me the most is representative of the book as a whole: \\"So far, I have decided to take whatever my disease can throw at me, and to stay combative even while taking the measure of my inevitable decline. I repeat, this is no more than what a healthy person has to do in slower motion. It is our common fate.\\"
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put the book down and am depressed I've finished it.  The characters felt so real, and you just want to keep reading about them.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|absolutely fab book, could not leave it down - peter may is a great writer and am reading all his books
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I really like it so far, very down to earth and easy to understand!  Very good explanations of what you need to know!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I think this  was your best book yet.  I wish there was a sixth book  in the Percy Jackson series
B000KIPT30|5.0|We use headsets because we are older and want individual control on the volume.  I saw this product on line several months ago during a quest to find a way to get better sound.  I did not purchase it at that time because I did not think such an inexpensive product was going to help.  Then a close lightening strike fried the $300.00++ amplifier we were using at the time.  We took a chance and purchased this product and now have the best sound reception we have had since everything went digital.  We highly recommend it to anyone who wants to boost headphone reception.
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|The Last Ship has sailed in, after anticipation for about two years when rumors of Sting's Soul Cages influenced Broadway show leaked out. Regarding the torrent of negative reviews, i really have to ask how clueless people were regarding this project. It has been touted as a Broadway show, written up in many websites and magazines yet people claim Sting is shallow and smug because he didn't write Fields of Gold II. Clueless.<br />As for me, I have been worried about Sting's listlessness in the last few years: Lute album, greatest hits, Winter. meh. This project is different. Sting is energized by his subject matter in a way he hasn't been for years. the lyrics are clever and intricate, the melodies wistful and haunting. Think of it as a story; a book on CD not so much an Album. Highlights are The Last Ship (electrifying images of the Resurrection, Language of Birds and, one of the best, Its Not The Same Moon. Have a brandy, put on the fire, grow your beard out and listen to this darkly hued slice of working class England. Looking for Every Breath my Desert Rose Takes in Fields of Gold Are Magic, move along.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Before buying the video (or any video) I read the reviews.  I am in my mid 60's and like a good workout.  Because of my age I'm very cautious about doing anything that will injure me.  I have Jillian's No More Trouble Zone workout and I love it so I'm very familiar with the moves in these 20 minute workouts but at a much faster pace.  However, what I will not do is follow the advanced moves as I know my limitations.  I would agree if you have bad knees or any other medical condition to avoid these workouts.  So, as long as I can do these without injury I will be doing so.<br /><br />So far I've done #1 and #2 so I will do these until I feel comfortable to move on (or maybe not).  I really like Jillian's method of teaching and I love her exercises.  I'm working to get my last 10 pounds off and hope to have that complete by the end of the year.  With these exercises and eating right I'm sure I'll get to my objective.<br /><br />Update:  I did Workout #3 and I was panting.  I would never attempt to do some of these jumping moves even if I were younger.  I can definitely see why people got knee injuries if they attempted to do this.  Definitely just use common sense and do not attempt to do things you don't feel comfortable with.  You can get a good workout without doing the more advanced moves - believe me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am in love with this show, I can't wait for season 4 From the start, I knew this was going to be a favorite of mine. The theme song is so romantic, it takes you to a different time and place, while teaching us about past lifestyles. Not to mention where it is filmed, that house is amazing if you can call it a house and to think it is still lived in! A must see series.
0307279189|5.0|This was a very interesting book, and not just for us who love running and actually completed at least a marathon ourselves.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A friend told me about the Downton Abbey Series and how good it was.  I was skeptical because I was under the impression it would be something my grandmother would enjoy because it was a PBS series. Boy was I wrong, it has a little bit of everything....mystery, suspense, romance, all talking place at an estate in England during the pre and post WWI.  Each episode is a story in itself, building from the previous episode.
1587613379|5.0|This is a very interesting book that challenges the regular view of the intimate relationships. I highly recommend it to everybody.
B00E3BK0QQ|1.0|i cant get it downloaded on my system. I have tried many times to download and it will not complete the download of data
B00CEF014E|2.0|This was a fairly short read with a lot going on.  My overall impression of it was that it was just underdeveloped.  It could have been good, but it lacked context.<br /><br />I didn't find the characters to be very developed, most notably the main character Dana.  I felt very ambivalent towards her and honestly didn't much care what happened to her; I just didn't know enough about her, other than what was happening to her in the here-and-now, to form an opinion one way or the other.  It's hard to enjoy a book when you don't feel an attachment to the main character.<br /><br />Dana's relationship with her sister wasn't developed.  I know that her sister essentially raised her from an early age because their parents died in a car crash, but that's about it.  Whether or not they had a close relationship, I can't say.  I can only assume that they are not close considering Dana didn't know about Zoe's adopted children.  I'd have liked to have some back-story on their relationship.<br /><br />I feel like the book went from point A to B to C, etc., too quickly.  I often read long books and wonder if the same story could have been told more concisely, but a book like this reminds me that the devil is in the details.  Those seemingly insignificant details and superfluous scenes really help paint a fuller picture of the world that you're being drawn into.  I felt more like an outsider to this story, and I never really became all that invested in it.<br /><br />Points of view changed abruptly, and often it'd take a half a paragraph to realize that's what's going on.  There was no white space indicating change in point of view.<br /><br />The story itself was somewhat entertaining, though pretty implausible.  I wish I had better things to say, but I've read many many books with tightly-woven storylines that I love, and this just wasn't one.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved every part of this book!!!  Laughed and cried!  A must read!<br />Didn't want it to end!  So well written!
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Christoph Waltz is absolutely fantastic in this movie.  The first 15-20 minutes should be used as a tutorial in any acting school.
B00F91H666|5.0|I hadn't read the book. This was a really thrilling movie. Great ending. Wondering if they're going to make a sequel.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|The series is good, but it is hard to read. They are releasing a graphic novel set for the series which the first one is great.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|This box set is absolutely wonderful! I enjoy listening to Stravinsky conducting his own works - it's the ultimate interpretation. I have no complaints.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book is great, and it keep finding myself spending too much time reading it. I hope the movie is as good.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed the ending of this book more so than the beginning. It was a nice climactic way to end the story that's compelling enough to make you pick up the next book of the series. I'd recommend this book to those who like an easy read and to be psychologically stimulated.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book is probably the best. You can tell though that she is trying to shove a lot into a small book. I wish the book was a two part and she put in more detail.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|A phenomenal film, exciting, real and an adrenalin rush! I'm former military and this film was as realistic as it gets in regards to squad tactics.  I loved it!
B000RD0RDU|5.0|Does what I needed, very good at cooling the case I put it in. Almost silent from a few feet away.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|We got this as a family time thing -  we originally had the VHS,  which was as old AS the dinosaurs portrayed in the movie itself!  It was such a treat to finally go from VHS right into blue ray! The color difference was just amazing!  The sounds were so much clearer and the digital copy was a huge bonus!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great middle book setting up the plot for what is going to end it all. The author really can setup the visuals in your mind.
B0031Y4A94|5.0|The Original Heavy Metal bands material is available on vinyl for those of us that hear the lack of sound on poor quality formats, vinyl has made a comeback so shop for a turntable and wonder why, as you are listening to this ancient technology how the purest form of recording still survives. Vinyl Rocks!!
1449415881|5.0|That is about all I can say. I love coming to work in the morning and reading the daily strip.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Baldacchino is one of the very best...He is right up there with Woods, Coulter and a few others...so put your feet up and begin the adventure...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great opener to a great series. I love all three books. The Author really put a lot of work and you can tell while reading the series.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Lots of twists and turns keeps you in suspense throughout the entire book  I enjoyed the book alot and will read more
B00F35BV64|4.0|Had all the Trek essentials, rouge captain, captain being punished, Bones saying stupid things, Spok showing emotion, Klingons, Enterprise gets beat up, bridge shakes and smokes...fun!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a very cute and easy game .I highly recommend it especially for all Facebook gamers .I think they would love it.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This was one of the best produced Zombie movies that I have seen...and I think I have seen them all. Watch it, have fun!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great 4.5stars chair breaks Nebraska hehe jjdjdjjansxjs make members check-in demand chicks nd  he bandanas mechanisms disks demand news  ANdes
B00F35BV64|4.0|Having been a trekkie since captain kirk began his first venture into space (yes I watched the show the 1st time it appeared on tv), I must admit I do enjoy these sequels especially in this one which added history/depth to khan (did ricardo look like that in his youth? ;-) ). This movie has plenty of action and it moves rather quickly. No 5th star as i'm at a loss to explain the death of pike who appeared in the first show as a cripple. I did laugh at the tribble making an appearance, and caught the hand motion of kirk and spock in reversed roles with kirk coming out of the reactor [recall the movie scene).I think I will watch it again to see what I missed the first time.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|Clever plot inside a plot. Catchy music. My kids (ages 8 and 9) absolutely adore this movie.<br />Wish it were available to rent instead of only buy but we've already watched it twice so it's working out.
0316247545|5.0|It's a great book for &#34;my little pony&#34; fans!  My kids read and read and read...  They enjoy it a lot.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|This is a great movie. I'm not a zombie film fan but this film has a quality seldom seen in a horror film. I highly recommend this movie. The acting is believable and keeps to on the edge of your seat throughout.
B002RI9MWA|4.0|This was a very interesting and confronting novella. It's ambivalence, constant sense of menace and enunciation of the major issues  relating to a now popular dilemma in international relations was quite brilliant. It also underlined the fundamental truth that we are all human, have very similar reactions and share a universal appreciation of the possibly unanswerable questions of life and the problem of dealing with the effects of religion and culture.in a globalised world.<br />Nevertheless the embedded understory of the &#34;personal&#34; of two human beings and its outcomes was compelling. I thought the work excellent in its understatement - while leaving it all there for the reader. Thank you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I are enjoying catching up on this marvelous series!  Season 3 is darker than the first two, but all the characters are so intertwined you just have to watch the next episode - just like a really good book!!
B00821BLX4|4.0|Works great.  Thanks for lens cap.  Unexpected surpirse.  Looking forward to using different lens thanks to the adapter.<br /><br />Worth the price
B001ANSSDC|5.0|If I am honest, I would have never read this book if I had not met \\"Uncle Dave \\" who is listed in the acknowledgement this past week at a convention. I am so glad I did !! Being a Philly native, Matthew Quick depiction of the die hard Eagles fan  and their fanatic rituals that they live by were spot on. For those who are not from Philly, you may think all the characters and their sport obsession and bizarre rituals would make them just as mentally unstable as Pat. Matthew also does an amazing job of giving a small glimpse of what emotional turmoil a person with mental illness must struggle with in their journey of acceptance in a society that truly has  failed to acknowledge and support  those who suffer from these debilitating diseases.  I am hooked and will add Matthew Quick to my must read author list!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does the basics very well. In addition, the user interface is attractive, clean and very intuitive. I have zero complaints.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Nicely made movie, the little boys are great actors!<br /><br />A little too G rated for me though. Needed something more challenging to think and wonder about.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Holy Cow!  This is such a good album!  I got the japanese version when it came out in May.  I also got the American version when it came out in July.  I'm still listening to it on a very frequent basis!  Great, all the way around - playing, vocals, songs, production, etc.  I haven't heard anything this good in years.  Get it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Such a delight. I loved how the stories were interwoven in such a seamless way. I loved the various settings around the globe. I typically read very quickly, but this one took me several weeks. I really appreciated the writing.
B000IZXR20|3.0|It's okay. I wouldn't watch it again unless someone I knew hasn't seen it. The plot of the movie is seen 5 minutes into the movie.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I had heard about the series but never got around to watching it.  Started a few days ago and have watched the first season in 4 days.  We are choosing this even with the new premiers on the regular channels.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|I've always been a huge Metallica fan, but I haven't loved their last few albums.  So seeing Newsted make this album and give it this name was kinda refreshing.<br /><br />I caught them live with Megadeth and a couple of other bands I didn't care for, and it was a great show that inspired me to buy this album as soon as it was released.<br /><br />Well worth the money, and worthy of its name.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|What a fantastic read! Totally engrossing. The best book that I've read in a long time. It might make a runner out of me yet!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Downloaded this app several times but it will not install on my Toshiba tablet. Very, very frustrating. I would really like to try it as I love to read.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|A good read. Hard to put down. Flowed nicely, kept my attention. Loved the events leading up to the ending.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|lucid, descriptive totally sucking you into the story.  A great read and character study of forgiveness, redemption and finding one's self.
B0055B7IPE|3.0|certainly a typical Disney type flick. Touching and light, but not enough to become too attached to the characters. Meh
B002XTXFU8|5.0|huge fan of the director , Tom Hardy is also my favorite actor so i love this movie. Its very unique I've never seen a movie like this before
B002PEP4C8|4.0|Alice is very talented.  She got extremely personal in this book and it seems to have made her better for it.  I would have never guessed she went through so much pain.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I am a fan of the series but do not always get a chance to watch all the episodes.  Having them on DVD is a great way for me to watch shows I have missed or rewatch episodes that I really liked. I am looking forward to the 9th season opener.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. Fun during my daily commute. I got my girlfriend hooked too. I'm sure anyone would love it. Try it out.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Loved it and if you liked the other movies you most likely will enjoy this one.  Definitely a nice addition to my collection.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Just started playing this like everyone else that is an angry birds fan.....can't put it down as usual too......great game.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This is not a work of literature. Infact the style used by the author may seem abrupt n jarring. The characters are not fleshed properly.
0439023521|5.0|I'm not sure if you have heard of this book, but it just came out like not too long ago.  I would read it.  Hopefully if enough people buy it, they'll make a sequel.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Awesome rendition!!! Of the many versions out there, this is by far my most favorite. Stunning in every way possible!!!
B005PTYP70|5.0|I really like all of these movies.  I think 2 was the one that was iffy.  However, I need to upgrade it to Blu-ray now so let me know if you'd like to buy it from me.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|How much more cliche this book could be? It had potential, but the author just couldn't wrap it up. I was a bit disappointed.
0425263924|1.0|This novel was absolutely pointless.  There was nothing going on for most of the book. I feel like I was ripped off. I read the first one so I felt it only fair to read all THREE not FIVE.  I paid full price for all three,  but I refuse to buy another book from Sylvia Day.  This was my first time reading anything from her and this is what she pulls? A money making scheme. I'll stick to authors who do it for the love of writing. Not  some money grubber.
B00511ONPG|4.0|I really like this Book. I gained some really great ideas on how to better my social media presence. If you want to be Likeable on social media and you want to make your presence known, I would recommend this book. It's an easy quick read with good idea starters.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This rates a 10/10. Acting by all major roles is phenom AND supporting roles too. It is the current best series.
0738212415|5.0|I've been toying with the idea of learning to draw for some time now. As a physicist, I tend to think visually about everything, no matter how abstract, and yet I could never communicate these mental images adequately. My problem, like many &#34;advanced&#34; learners, is that I don't like sucking at new things for very long. At one point, I've tried both Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain and Rapid Viz, but neither were quite right for me in that it took too long before I felt somewhat skilled and proud of my progress, and I lost steam. Perhaps too much &#34;explaining&#34; and not enough &#34;instruction&#34;, or lessons that are too overwhelming/too slow?<br /><br />Mark Kistler has found a way to get you to draw things that you can be proud of in very short order with almost no wasted words--learn by easy example! In only the first couple lessons (3-4 hours max), I was drawing scenes with simple 3D shapes and realistic shading. Only a few lessons later and I can draw a cute koala face. Soon I will be drawing cylinders and cityscapes. At this point, I am capable of drawing just about any building I see. So far (lesson 9), the pace he sets is perfect for me.<br /><br />I highly recommend checking out his website for other simple characters that build on simple shapes. Why? My coworkers made fun of my egg-shaped &#34;circles&#34;, so I turned them into funny &#34;ninja eggs&#34; thanks to a short 3 minute video tutorial. They loved them!<br /><br />If you've been struggling to learn how to draw after many failed attempts (or maybe you want the most painless intro possible), you will enjoy Mark's approach to get you drawing pretty well very quickly. My advice: take pride in each lesson, even the first one drawing a sphere. Really practice that shading! There's no rush. Read his intro to the book. His advice is spot on.<br /><br />Do invest in good pencils, stomps, and paper. I love the Pro Art 19 piece pencil set and Canson sketch pad. You will enjoy how they feel and will make you really feel like an artist while you practice.<br /><br />My plan after this finishing this book is to revisit Rapid Viz and Drawing on the Right Side for more practice/deeper study. Wish me luck!el and will make you really feel like an artist while you practice.<br /><br />My plan after this finishing this book is to revisit Rapid Viz and Drawing on the Right Side for more practice/deeper study.

B005DJREGQ|4.0|Teen oriented show that does not dumb things down needlessly.  Tolerable for adults to watch as well.  Generally enjoyable as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|loved this season, gripping end cant wait till season 4<br />would recommend it to everyone. love amazon prime so glad I got this
B0064MGU98|5.0|A little addictive to watch :)<br />Amazing actor cast, very tastefully done. I strongly recommend this show to everyone, even men!
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Geoff Tate, Alex Rose and Scott Stapp should all just become the best of friends. They've all fronted bands that were at one point on top of the world and yet they managed to be such douche bags and piss their success down the drain. For any fans that have being away since the Empire days this album will feel like coming home. Todd La Torre is to Queensryche what  Arnel Pineda was to Journey. Sounding like a young Geoff Tate when he gave a damn about the band Todd La Torre manages to school Mister Tate in every which way. I find it funny that Mister Tate has stated in a lot of interviews that he wanted to expanded and grow music wise and not do the same old thing but the first chance he gets he puts together a band and goes out playing Operation Mind Crime! I'm very excited to see this version of the band when they come back around my part of town.
B00006AW2O|5.0|I love those old Stones albums with the blues and Motown covers. You also get to hear the late Brian Jones, who was quite a fine musician. I giggle a bit at Mick's soul voice because it sounds a bit put on, but still it's GREAT!<br /><br />However, I have a question: I just repurchased this CD/MP3 having lost track of my old LP. The version of Susie Q was one of my favorites, but it sounds too fast to me now. Can anyone check the timing on an old LP copy? Time speeds up as you age??
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|good book- did not want to put it down - very well written and I enjoyed it very much -
1452126577|5.0|This cat kill me.  Every pose / look / &#34;thought&#34; of his / keeps me laughing everyday. This book is a great way to just pick up and laugh at home being nu-plugged from the internet..
B00CH26TL8|4.0|well some times I get tire of been doing this game but I still have it in my table for raining days
0985557834|5.0|This version has some great new ideas and and the simple to use pictures are just perfect even for my kids.
1439153663|4.0|The characters are well developed and easy to &#34;know&#34; and the story teller employs a unique perspective to carry the story forward.  It moves pretty quickly, but not so fast you get lost.  The author's description of her creative process was a bit interesting.  I'm not quite sure if she's saying it's actually historical fiction.  I would not give this book to my daughter younger than about 16 or 17, depending on maturity.  There are definitely some adult themes--tastefully handled and appropriate to the storyline, but adult nonetheless.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Highly recommended.  Author provides great insights into how people will process information differently and causes one to rethink how they draw conclusions.  Also highlights how this knowledge is sometimes used to intentionally manipulate people's opinions.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Disappointing compared to the other four books. The author left characters dangling with no ending and he skipped around too much in the story line
B003XRELGQ|4.0|This is my second Kurt Vonnegut book.  He has an interesting style.  It is an interesting story, and is peppered with subtle surprises.
B0026P3G12|5.0|5 stars for this CD because one I am a fan of Susan boyle and 2 the cd came quite fast, speedy service and I like that, just 2 days it took form the day I purchased to owning it and listen to it.
B00122K35M|4.0|Over all very good.  Particularly liked Life in Dark Water.  I'm surprised at how few people know of Al Stewart.  The songs are mellow.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Love, love, love TED. What a great app and what a great site. Where else can you go to get great scientific or just great ideas about everything. Great minds gathering and expressing ideas, right on my kindle.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I liked it, but it seems there are two parts, and could have been separated where the protagonist leaves the silo.  Overall well and creative.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game was surprisingly fun and addictive, until the ads that popped up covered half the screen, with no way to close them. They will go away after about two minutes, but pop right back up again thirty seconds later. Other than that, really fun game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I had this on my phone for years. I love it on the kindle with the big screen. This is in my opinion the best game app to date
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|The Game is fun, but after 13 or 14 levels you have to pay $1.99 to continue, so its not a free game, just a preview.
B005FISC52|5.0|I rated this a 5 star because it packaging was great and the overall product was great.  I love One Tree Hill and thanks to Amazon, I have completed my series at a reasonable cost!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was an awesome read!  I loved every page and the book is even better than the movie!  I highly recommend this book for anyone that likes to read fiction.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game out there!!! Lov the interaction with other players, power ups, daily free games and daily free credits. Play everyday with friends. Would recommend to anyone who loves bingo!!!
B00B81B0HC|4.0|I like several songs on this cd, none of the others have particularly grown on me yet but that takes time.
B008JFUO72|1.0|Do not waste your money on this!I was very disappointed in the lack of story line and the depth of characters in the movie. You could tell they wanted quantity over quality with this sequel.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I enjoy her voice and her music.  I don't know that I would say I would buy it again, but I like many of the songs.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|I love this because you could show off at school, start a kid briskness at lunch at school, and make  new designs
B00C7DGQ9C|2.0|Well, I wasn't expecting a whole lot to begin with, but this movie doesn't have much going for it.  Way too much swearing and pretty scary parts.  In a very low-expectation sense it was fine.  Pretty much exactly what I expected (can you tell I wasn't the one wanting to buy it)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think this app is awesome and a great help its the best app ever and deserves the best users.
159463176X|4.0|At a time in history when the USA is making war in Hosseinis' part of the world it is good indeed that we have his storys to give us a glimpse into life there. I spent time in Pakistans' Northern Areas in 1994 (once part of Afghanistan.<br />After unsuccessfully going to war twice with Afghanistan in the early 1800s the colonial British, in all their unenlightened folly, forever doomed the peoples along the Pakistan/Afghan border to war and strife when they drew the Durand Line forming that border which passes straight through the middle of the Pashtun and Baloch civilizations---civilizations that populatd that area for thousands of years.<br />During the two months I spent in the remote North I quickly grew to love and respect these people of the mountains--their austere, hardy and noble lives. Of all the places I have been in the world it is there I left my heart and it is Hosseini who is now my only link to life there. There is so much to admire in their culture--so much to lament. It is a land and people of good and bad--and nothing in between.<br />Should the war-mongering Americans ever tire of war there I will be the first to return.<br />Thankyou, Khaled for keeping me in touch!<br /><br />DH Koester--\\"And There I Was\\", Vol 3 [[ASIN:143279325X AND THERE I WAS VOLUME III: A Backpacking Adventure In Pakistan and China]]
B0069JBKHI|2.0|After much research we decided this was the best baby moniter.  In theory it was but after about a month it constantly would disconnect and you couldn't use it. Very disappointed.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Anyone who read and shivered through \\"The Shining\\" has surely thought about young Danny Torrance from time to time throughout their lives and wondered/worried about what kind of man he grew up to be.  Now that those questions have been answered, I find myself equal measures of relieved and disappointed: Relieved because DOCTOR SLEEP didn't suck, as I worried it might; disappointed because I feel like King took the easy road in a lot of ways.  Not that he shies away from the hard questions, such as Danny's genetic/emotional predisposition to alcoholism and violence - the grown Dan Torrance hits rock bottom with a sickening thud, and his climb to redemption cannot help but be fascinating to anyone who \\"knew\\" him as a little boy.  Grown-up Dan's memories of the Overlook Hotel are the scariest parts of this book, but mostly because we as readers cannot help but relive the terrors young Danny faced there and how they have resounded in our nightmares through the years.<br /><br />King missed so many opportunities in this book.  For one, he failed to flesh out the True Knot - a horrifying concept at first, rendered even more horrifying by depicting the torture and murder of a child in grisly detail that I'm not sure was necessary, the members of the Knot became less and less scary as the book moved along, making the ending obvious before the book even hits the halfway mark. King's characterizations, even of secondary characters, has long been one of his strong points, making his reliance on quirky names such as \\"Rose the Hat,\\" \\"Silent Sarey,\\" \\"Jimmy Numbers,\\" to stand in for true characterization is about as far as it went.  The same with Abra's parents and her pediatrician, who were so one-dimensional as to be laughable.  Dan's other henchmen, his AA sponsor Casey and Bill, who runs the Teenytown railroad, were characters we've met many a time between the pages of a Stephen King novel.  Perhaps the most vivid characterization was Teenytown itself, and its charming railroad - someplace you can picture vividly and feel like you're really there.<br /><br />Most disappointing to me was the climax, where Dan Torrance must return to the place where the Overlook once stood.  Expectations are horrible things, I know, and the downfall of reading many a sequel, but I'll come right out and say it:  I expected more from Danny's return.  In fact, I expected more from the entire book.  Many readers have complained about the length of some of King's books, and an overblown writing style, but I have never been one of those readers.  I felt this story would have been far better served had it been longer and given King the room to bring his characters to life.<br /><br />Despite the aforementioned gripes, I can't say I didn't enjoy DOCTOR SLEEP.  I can't say my heart didn't break, over and over again, for the little boy who grew up in the shadow of horror and tragedy that his own gift/curse, his Shining, contributed to - which made the cheesiest moment of the entire book the one that brought tears to my eyes, even as the cynic in the back of my head was yelling, \\"Really?  REALLY???\\"  And that, as all Constant Readers surely know, is what keeps us coming back to Stephen King's books again and again... despite their flaws, there are moments of transcendence.  And while not every book can be as great as THE DARK TOWER sequence or 11/22/63 - or THE SHINING itself, for that matter - he always has brilliant ideas and moments of greatness that shine through the murk.  For me, that is enough to merit 4 stars, as well as my continuing devotion.
B00EY8ARYS|4.0|Great show, a good watch. It felt a tad bit cliche at times, and it kind of irritated me, but it was still Marvel! I loved the Iron Man 3 related touches and mentions of the Avengers. Here's to hoping they introduce more heroes and villains!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game!!!  It is fun and challenging at the same time.  The visual effects are awesome on my kindle fire hd.  I just wish the next edn of this was available (suppose to be available late 2013).  I will without a doubt purchase the next edn of this game.  Highly recommend this game.
B00F35BV64|2.0|This is a movie with Star Trek characters in it. I felt pandered to throughout the movie through vague out of place references to original Star Trek characters for no reason other than the writer Googled the original series and then he was done with the Star Trek portion of the movie. There were enough plot holes in this movie you could fly a couple of space ships through them. Totally disappointed.
B000054OTY|5.0|Great movie loved how it is a revenge plot. Brando at his finest, too bad this was the only movie that he directed.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|SIMIPLY THE BEST!!!<br />We all he is the Master and now I have a copy forever in my library!!<br />Simply the Best Entertainer the world has ever seen!!!
0143119680|1.0|A smart, successful woman hears about Twilight and says to herself, \\"I could write a much better story about vampires!\\"<br /><br />Except she couldn't. Our protagonist, Diana Bishop, bears a striking resemblance to our author, and the first person narration only serves to cement the idea.<br /><br />The painfully long book goes virtually nowhere, as we meet our heroine in the Cambridge stacks, only to go though an series of chapters that find her still in the library. Each chapter is identified with a line drawing of an ouroboros, which seemed clever at first, but by chapter 6 appeared to be a cruel taunt.<br /><br />I'm comfortable with a slow start, especially with fledgling writers, but Harkness' meandering narration and clumsily developed plot points leave me with little faith that she can create a story, much less see it through.<br /><br />Descriptions of vampire perfection are painfully dull, especially when combined with forced \\"facts\\" about them (Diana's childhood fear of a vampire stealing her thoughts is a downright bizarre way to tell the reader, \\"MY vampires don't read thoughts! MY vampires are different!\\")<br /><br />Tropes abound, but they are used without irony which makes the book cringeworthy.<br /><br />Miss. Harkness, please consider better pacing and plot development in the future. The potential is there, but the book reads like an earlier draft of a better novel. It's verbose, uninteresting, and forgets where it was trying to go.
B003R50FRI|5.0|Thank you for inviting me into your magical world of real people.  When do I get to share the rest of your journey?
B004J4WNL2|2.0|I mistakenly thought that this would be an interesting read about different personality types. In truth, it started with some interesting material, then had more of a feel of a self help book and a chronicle of Cain's research. I was a little underwhelmed by that aspect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is really good. Its not fake. But it is the best game ever.You should<br />Try it.:-) -:
B008Y7D4FY|5.0|Had to see Insidious first before seeing Insidious 2. Glad I did because after enjoying the first version, I enjoyed and understood the second one more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Bought the ebook for my daughters kindle. Easy to download and install.  Can't review actual book since it wasn't for me. 5 stars for ease of purchase, download and installation.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Short and simple , LOVE IT.  I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. Its a movie for all ages.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I was looking forward to this from the time I saw the trailer. A fine movie, with all around excellent performances from the cast, this story of an earth devastated by war between... but that would be telling and if I say anything, it will spoil the movie. I will say it looks beautiful and unlike some critics, I enjoyed the story as well as the visuals.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher's voice sounds great and songs are high energy and ready to hit the dance floor. This is definitely Cher's trade mark.  It's a must have to be added to your collection....
B002XBVQKW|5.0|Hilarious classic musical with an all star cast. They do not have creativity like this in this day and age!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Thought it was a good movie. Brad Pitt is awesome as always. Jumped several times during the movie. Super Zombies!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|HILARIOUS, great movie, some people will not get the humors, those who do will be thoroughly amused. one of my favorites. Definitely worth checking out for this price.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is amazing in every detail possible! I love the new updates it have. Wish they could create sea units too though.
B005CAATXG|5.0|Wonderful if you like rock, that has meaningful lyrics. I can't wait to get the second album. Look up &#34;Cynics and Critics&#34; if you're interested in their new stuff. This is a must have Album!
B005MC8V2A|5.0|Fantastic wrapping up of a series that I totally loved. Thank goodness there is a continuation in the form of Dani, otherwise I think I would have been screaming right now. Most definitely one of my favourites!
0061950726|4.0|I purchased this book when I saw that they had offered a Kindle deal, so I first want to congratulate Christina Baker Kline on the book's success on the NYT bestseller list -- and thank her for celebrating with a deal for us. This is an excellent book: well written, with characters who are interesting, intriguing, and flawed. I'm no longer in a book club because I'm traveling, but will recommend it to my \\"old\\" book club, as I am sorry not to have a group with whom I can discuss \\"Orphan Train\\".

B008XG1X18|5.0|I didn't think there was a need for something like pinterest. But I was wrong! It helps me stay organized and when my friends find a recipe or article of clothing they like I can see it.
B00DYEBM3I|2.0|It takes more than fan enthusiasm for a long-awaited return to create a solid album. I don't know what the fuss is about. Yes, Hope sounds the same. And this album feels like a dusty collection of unremarkable b-sides.<br /><br />I sat down, I gave this record my full attention, and not a single track makes me yearn for a return listen.<br /><br />Do you love this album? What stellar track did I miss? Please tell me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|if you were to let us get more coins on hebnorm id like y'all even more.  this game has me addicted ill play this every day
B00BMR5HOO|3.0|I don't like icons, can you tell? A simple word or two: cloudy, sunny, or windy shouldn't be too hard. Sunrise &amp; sunset would be a nice addition. I like having a page full of locations with comparisons. And it is easy to add &amp; delete locations.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an a amazing narrative of true heroes, lest they never be forgotten.  Thankfully we have people like this in our country.
B003MAS9S0|5.0|Great first movie to the series. It did lack in a few places but it was still a decent movie.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I received this mouse as a present as a gift a week ago and I have been completely blown away. Every part of this mouse reeks of quality, from the box, to the point where the cable attaches to the mouse. Incredible software for adjustments. I have large hands (6'4\\" tall) and this mouse fits my hand like a match made in heaven, but it probably seems that way because I am so accustomed to using puny mice. Overall, I am very impressed by Anker and their product.<br /><br />Edit: I experienced a problem with the right-click button on the mouse and I contacted Anker. They immediately offered a full exchange and even paid for the return shipping. Best customer service possible!
1626810915|5.0|The book came in great condition, is a quick read, and has advice that is applicable to anyone. All entrepreneurs should read this.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I was unable to finish the book as it did not hold my attention. I know others loved it, but I did not get into it.
0143118757|5.0|great product .. thanks
B0019IB0II|5.0|This is an intriguing account of a scientist's view of her mind as she experiences<br />a stroke and her long recovery. It is a message of hope for survivors of strokes and<br />their caregivers. The way she deals with losing her sense of who she was before the<br />stroke and who she is now depicts great strength of character and grit.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Bought all three seasons and watched them in one week--much prefer that to watching them each week.  It was far more enjoyable that way and we loved it!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|The preview made it look dumb. But i saw it on tv and loved it watched it three times in a row. So i bought it
B0007LGCB8|5.0|I have 9 pairs of keens.  Of the 9, my three pairs of Newports are my favorites.  The uppers are heavy leather and wear incredibly well.  My first pair of Keens that I purchased many, many years ago is a pair of Newports, and they are still holding up very well.  A scrub with bath soap and a soft brush, then air dry, helps keep them fresh.<br />Size: I wear size 11 shoes. Size 11 Newports fit well without socks.<br />Sizing Hint: Some Keens run a half size small. Some a half size large. Some are true to size.  Be sure and check Keen's web site for a sizing guide for each style.<br />Pricing hint: I have been watching the price on this style for a couple of months (cart -save for later).  Amazon changes the price often and the price varies from $100 pair to $62 a pair. When they hit $62 pair, I jumped on my 3rd pair of Newports a couple of days ago.
1607744104|5.0|Learned a lot just by skimming through the pages when I first got the book.<br />Filled with great pictures so you don't have to Google search everything you're reading about.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This was one of the best movie I've seen in a long time, it had humor, sadness and feeling...lots and lots of feeling, giving the viewer a glimpse into the lives of black maids, and the way they were treated by &#34;entitled&#34; white people...very good movie...loved it!!
B00005JLXE|2.0|Trying to be a darker version of a superhero movie, `Daredevil' gets points for trying something different (well, at the time it was different), but sadly the execution cannot meet the intent and leaves us with an uneven and unsuccessful outcome.  The cast is not really up to the task, with Colin Farrell going more hokey than intense and Ben Affleck's brooding becoming a distraction.  Jennifer Garner and the late Michael Clarke Duncan fare better, but not by a huge margin.  Sadly though, it was the construction of the film that falters the most and fails the actors, giving us a messy and unfocused product.  This is long considered one of the worst superhero films, and I have to agree to a degree.  It tries, but it fails.  There is no real originality, and while the stunts here are impressive to an extent, they are redundant and ultimately underdeveloped and lazy.  In fact, the best way to describe the finished product is lazy, despite attempting to be just the opposite.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This book, to me, was Reacher at his finest. Although separated from his partners, he was willing and able to intercept the code. Never leaving his fellow soldiers behind. Fighting for his lost friends and fellow coworkers, until the perpetrators were brought to His kind of justice....payback!<br /><br />Never mess with the special investigators!!!
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sting has had some ups and downs but is easily one of the top lyricists and songwriters in music today.  This is not for everyone - no pop singles, no ringtones here - but if you are willing to pour yourself a drink, sit back and take it all in, The Last Ship will stay with you and demand additional listening.<br /><br />Some people will think it's overly pretentious, but in fact it is so emotional and so well done and so seemless from beginning to end that you think you have heard these melodies before. Evoking the very best from Irish folk, Broadway and popular styles, Sting mixes the emotional rollercoaster like a master DJ.  The storyline of Sting's childhood in a shipping town is woven together with hindsight, maturity and musical genius - I dare you to find another lyricist who can paint the pictures Sting evokes throughout. I cannot think of any album in recent years to even put in the same league. The best of Coldplay, Muse, and Leonard Cohen pale.<br /><br />Ballad of the Great Eastern had my teenage son replaying it in the car, and both versions of Practical Arrangement are worth the price of the disc by themselves.  From dirges to Irish sea shanty to love songs to tongue-in-cheek, it's all here.  But the crowning achievement is the sprawling Shipyard, which can easily stand with anything that Les Miz can overproduce, only with more conviction, vivid characters and music so organic to the song that you really wonder how it isn't some long lost relic of time, just reporduced and updated for our time.<br /><br />Sting proves that although this isn't for everybody, your time will be well rewarded, and you will be moved.<br /><br />An epic achievement.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I am a huge Scalzi fan and read his blog, whatever.scalzi.com often.  He is a great author and seems like an all around good guy.  Redshirts is a pretty amusing book.  Its not my favorite work of his but it is worth a read and I am sure, since I bought the ebook version, that I will find myself re-reading it at some point in time.  If you are a fan of scifi, and especially of the older star trek shows, I recommend you give this one a shot!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I liked the friendship formed by the two leading female characters.  I never know anything about the orphan trains and enjoyed learning about them.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|It seems that most people didn't like this movie because it destroyed the book.  I didn't read the book, but probably will now that I know the concept.  The movie was well filmed and looks great.  However, the story is fairly flat and predictable.  The ending is interesting but executed in a pretty silly way.  Overall, I liked the action and the zombies but found the human part to be fairly bland.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I started reading this as soon as it downloaded onto my Kindle. 24 hours later I was done.<br />It tied the characters from The Shining together perfectly and really made you care about Dan(ny) Torrance and Abra.<br />It was not as scary as The Shining but as King was 37 years younger when he wrote it, I was 30 years younger when I read it. That didn't retract from the book at all.<br />If (like me) you haven't read The Shining for a long time I would advise you to read it again to refresh your memory.<br />All in all - a great book and King at his finest.
B000PEX1IE|5.0|I have no idea why they continue making movies after ghostbusters was made, it is by far the best #1 move. All other movies are #2 or lower.
034580404X|5.0|The trilogy of 50 shades will make you sit not waiting til the end. I will be reading these books again and my husband likef me reading these books
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is one of the best Science Fiction shows that we have watched as a family.  The lines are terrific and the chemistry between the cast members is perfect.  Great drama with great comedy.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Many of the other reviews focus specifically on the poor business practices of the producers.  Extras have been spread throughout different versions of the film, leaving each \\"set\\" incomplete.  While I do not condone these practices, I fail to see the point in giving the film itself a poor rating solely for this reason.<br /><br />As a film and writing enthusiast, Startrek Into Darkness fell short of the previous film.  Rather than the smooth ride that one might expect of a feature film, the director has decided to pay homage to the origination of the concept.  The result is a choppy film that can subdivided into individual episodes.  The first series of these episodes seem redundant as rewards and punishments become as mangled as the relationships between characters.  Perhaps the biggest misstep of the film was its failure to delve the rich mine of the relationships aboard the Enterprise.  The stuttering steps caused by the 'episodes' caused most of these relationships to be taken for granted, rather than taking the time to delve and refine these intricate character connections on-screen.<br /><br />The introduction of the villain in the film seemed to solidify the plot into one belonging on the big screen.  The contrast between both heroes and villains were made all the more apparent by the muddling of the lines between good and evil.  This lent both credibility to the characters with the justification for their actions, as well redemption for the film that seemed to be gripped in a downward spiral since the beginning.  The action scenes were nice, but each only increased the mounting tension toward the end of the film.  The final bouts ended in my least favorite writing device: A deus ex machina implemented to give future movies in the franchise a... non-recycled plot.<br /><br />That being said, I am still a huge fan of this attempt at rebooting such a popular series.  I was let down by the format, as well as the laziness of some of the writing tools that were used.  The visuals were just as stunning and I know most fans will enjoy the dichotomy of the original timeline.  I sincerely hope that any continuations live up to the standards that the first film set.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|One of the better interactive stories for young children. My 4 year was totally engrossed in the story. We've gone through it probably 10 times already.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Love the town description and the way she describes the people in the book it makes them feel like they could be your neighbors and the relationship the siblings share you can tell the Author comes from a close family. Can't wait to read about Aaron and Lacey.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|TO me seems totally useless.  It did not help me in any way.  It is too confusing and hard to understand
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book so touching read it twice I hope you love it too. Than again I am sure you will
B00594XOZU|4.0|My experience with Kim has always been great. Then I logged out of kik and for some reason I can't log back in. It says that it's taking to long. Is there any reason that this could be happening. I've uninstalled and installed it back in. Yet it keeps saying that is there anything I can do get back into my kik?  Other wise it is an amazing app.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Here you can find some very important information about the Roman occupation of Palestine and the Jewish nationalist movements of the time. That said, there's a bit of twisting of obscure New Testament references to suit the author's point, that is Paul and his followers completely revised the historical Jesus to suit the religious tastes of the Roman Empire's gentiles. After reading the book,  I felt a little like I did after finishing Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" unconvinced and resentful that the novel cast me as the victim of one of history's greatest hoaxes.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Elizabeth Banks portrait during her characters' pregnancy was spot on for me during my pregnancy so I was laughing non-stop during her scenes! I didn't have an epidural or C-Section so my pain was excruciating! I do wish her character would have had to go through that though because apparently I \\"waited too long\\" to have an epidural! That would have been funny in HER CHARACTERS' situation!!!!
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|Loved this book! I couldn't wait to get back too it. I found myself eager to find out what was going to happen next? Would Lexi regain her memory? Would she leave her husband? I didn't want it to end. I wanted to see what happened next in Lexi's life.<br /><br />I would highly recommend \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\" by Sophie Kinsella and \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\".<br /><br />She is a great writer! Love her books!
B00D7OMNXS|1.0|I loved the first two Iron Man movies, but this third installment is complete garbage. If this was the screenplay offered to the studios as the first movie it never would have gotten a \\"green light\\".
B008QTUA5W|1.0|I had to laugh at all the one-star reviews that are mostly complaining about the nudity.  The nudity is the *best* thing about the show (especially Morena Baccarin; and no, it's not particularly gratuitous and certainly not pornographic as other reviewers have said, there seem to be a lot of serious prudes out there).  Beyond that, the pacing is tedious (how anyone can call this a \\"thriller\\" is beyond me), the characters are two-dimensional cutouts, none of them are at all sympathetic, and the dialogue is filled with unnecessary, over-obvious exposition that treats the audience like idiots.  After three episodes I gave up because I simply didn't care about anything or anyone.  The boobs aren't worth it; I'd rather watch Breaking Bad again and pick up all the little things I missed the first time around.  Writing can be way better than this, really.<br /><br />ETA: After reading the plot summaries here I skimmed a few of the later episodes and it does pick up a little bit, but my main complaints remain.  It's highly plot-driven, with most of the characters being neither sympathetic nor villainous, just kind of jerks.  The most interesting character is Walker's wife, and she's not given much.  The Israeli series Homeland is based on, Prisoners of War (Hatufim), is much better and worth tracking down, though unfortunately it's not available on area 1 DVD.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and I (and the rest of America) are addicted to Downtown Abbey! Smart, fun drama with some laughs. I love this era for TV and books and if you do too, you'll love this show!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I use this on my kindle for my morning alarm clock.  I really like that I can store multiple alarms for different times.
B00DYWKPAQ|3.0|KOL were a real breath of fresh (well I don't know about fresh, but you know what I mean) air in rock music when they arrived 10 years ago, releasing three original & innovative records (which is not always the most common trait when dealing with rock bands).<br />But then, perhaps because of the fame, fortune & celebrity life style KOL starting to sound like U2 or late-period Eagles, with their next two albums (\\"Only by the Night, Come around..\\") sounding safe & unimaginative.<br />2013's \\"Mechanical Bull\\" has been billed as the bands make or break album (although more critically than commercially; there's not much doubt that this record will sell by the bucket load).<br />It is admittedly slightly strong that KOL last couple of offerings, \\"Rock City\\", \\"Family Tree\\" are great funky rock songs, & \\"Beautiful War\\" is a pretty ballad. But the band soon resorts to type with a string of bland tracks, that the brothers could have written in their sleep.<br />It might have been a good Idea for KOL to have a taken create break from each other for a couple of years, perhaps to work on side-projects, then returning with their batteries recharged. Working with a producer who would push them out of their comfort zone, such as Nigel Goodrich wouldn't be such a bad idea either.<br />The deluxe version offers two extra songs (a bit measly, especially considering one of them is taken form a sound track. I mean it wouldn't have broken their necks to have put some demo or live songs on there).<br />\\"Work on line\\" is possible the most commercial song KOL have ever recorded, & is as far from their roots as the band have ever been. \\"Last Mile Home\\" is a pretty generic KOL tack that you've heard quite a few times over their last two albums.<br />So if you liked \\"Only by the Night\\" & \\"Come around..\\", you gonna love \\"Mechanical Ball\\", but if your like me & preferred KOL more invented & challenging first three records, you will, I'm afraid be disappointed once again.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is ok, but very difficult to find gru coins. Other than that it is an alright game. The obstacles keep changing, so if you have to go through a level more than once, it keeps it challenging.
B00F35BV64|5.0|My husband and I are Star Trek fans from back in the 60's.  We have seen them all.  This one was really exceptional.  Keep them coming.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I don't usually like these types of games, set up like a series almost. This one is good though. It holds my interest and I don't mind playing daily.
044024630X|4.0|Must confess that this is the first Reacher novel I stumbled across.  It was good, but certainly not great.  Some of the others I have read since that time are much better.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Love this season I was excited with every episode and Peter coming back and he and Olivia finding there way back to each orher
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I've now have had a chance to listen to this album a few times and slowly digest it, I like much more that the last release personally, I think it's the best in quite a few albums<br />I heard some people are complaining it's not \\"Heavy\\" enough ( Like Train Of Thought) and they are right, but why should it be another Train album? I love the way it has the classic vibe of DT on here with some Homage to RUSH ( check out \\"Looking Glass\\"). I feel this album flows well and James Labrie really shines on this album along with Mangini.<br />The production is great every nuance is heard and felt! ( I have some great headphones and let me tell you it rocks)<br /><br />The best song on the album is the 22 minute Illumination Theory an Epic Journey of rock & Metal<br /><br />I'm not going to review each song, tons of other people have done and will do that, all I can say it's a great album and if you are a true DT fan you will enjoy this album quite a bit.<br /><br />My Faves are:<br />Enigma Machine<br />Illumination Theory<br />The Bigger Picture<br />Surrender to Reason
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Then along comes walmart and sams club ads taking up the screen.  If it continues tomorrow it gets uninstalled.  And its an awesome game....addicting
B007704HO6|5.0|Written from the heart, the story is wonderful. The realisation that you do not get out of the hole so quickly, even if you have managed to get off the bottom makes it a revealing read. Real invisible life on the streets of London
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|my wife at first said &#34;go ahead and watch it but I will probably doze off&#34;  But she loved the movie also...
B00866H7SS|3.0|The story is bland and obvious, the facts are creative but not always believable, and the characters are shallow. Skipped many pages and never got to the end.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Just exactly what I wanted.  The color is beautiful; but to be fair; blue is my favorite, and I look good in it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was an easy read and reminded me of The Runaway Jury.  I liked the way everything was woven together into a great story.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy to setup and works great with Netflix. Cannot play music stored on my device with Goggle Play Music program. It must just be for streaming off of the Internet. Really do not want to open a Goggle streaming music account. Hope more companies sign on, especially Pandora. Noticed Sony has or will have a similar device. Worth the money but disappointed about the music.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie had so much potential to be better. I was disappointed but I am a Brad Pitt fan and he did a great job in his performance. So that's why I choose three stars other then that it would have gotten two.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I love the way that Kearns Goodwin takes history and makes it read like a story. This review is a little pre-emptive since I haven't finished the book, but so far I have loved this lens into the life of Abraham Lincoln and his political career.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Will not download on my tablet!  I use to be able to play it. It will let me play as guest...but can't play on my account.
B005MJDJQQ|4.0|Nice to read and you really want to see what happens at the end. It is a true  page turner.
B00439MV42|5.0|This is one of the best and absolutely most underrated sequels out there.  It is incredibly well done and is not weaker than the other two-in fact it could very well be stronger. Not only is it the perfect counterpoint to the other two as a part 3 ending that puts things in perspective, but the emotional heart of it is the best in all the films-the ultimate moral of making your future good while you can is timeless and resonates always, as does the amazing music by Alan Silvestri.  So much more than just a time travelling western-this is the movie that elevates Back to the Future above just a good time and makes it mean something.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I love the Sookie Stackhouse novels and have read every Single one! The book was good. I a, sad to see the series end, but I wished for a more dramatic finish.
B001EC2IV2|5.0|This movie to me is one of the best Arnold movies, action movies, and 90's movies.  The action is incredible, Arnold is awesome, the film is fast and funny, and it brings back good memories of a time when big blockbusters often took themselves less seriously and just had fun.  I miss those days but I'm glad I was raised on a good diet of the movies that came out then.  I'm glad Arnold's back but this one definitely was part of a golden era from when he seemed to be the number one movie star and each movie he did was eagerly awaited by all fans of adventure films.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I never saw this series, but I want to now. This is and excellent account of what our soldiers went through during WWII
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie combines some of the best things ever at their peak-Christmas comedies, Chevy Chase, the 80's, and John Hughes.  It's timeless nostalgia at it's best.

B001XUYA0W|5.0|Good movie.  It kept my interest until the end, and then, left me to wonder.  I like this kind of drama
B008602KQI|3.0|I can't give this a full and accurate review I only watch part of it and I had to change it because I was falling asleep. I hear it's really good though!
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I legitimately enjoyed every song from this album, something that I don't experience very often.  Now I really want to see Bastille in concert...
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this show! It is my one weakness! ;)<br />The idiosyncracies of each character are both entertaining and endearing.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|This is one of those shows that could be played to the uninitiated to show them what all the fuss is about. One of the best shows from one of the best years in the history of the band in glorious sound ( for 41 year old tapes). The DVD/Blue-Ray captures the Dead in all their telepathic, non-showbiz glory on a heat-stroked afternoon in August. Hippies are thrown in at no extra cost. A time capsule in that regard but some of the best \\"rock\\" music ever created, period. The Dead at the peak of their artistic vision creating something never really seen before. Run, don't walk to get this.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Nobody but Cher could be releasing a passionate banner release some fifty years after her original album debut to such a tremendous amount of deserved fanfare, make no mistake stellar release \\"Closer To The Truth\\" finds the wild Diva in peak form, distinctive glorious passionate voice brilliantly showcased in a richly varied set of songs tailor made for the iconic legend, from many recent appearances the amazing lady looks as great as she sounds!<br />Out of the gate \\"Woman's World\\" is a jammin' grand slam #1 dance hit sensation making one want to get up and move, exactly what thousands of excited fans were doing in New York during recent exhilarating & eventful live morning performance, showing Cher as musically relevant today as in the sixties, seventies, eighties on through to the nineties when \\"Believe\\" became the mega-blockbuster to date of her phenomenal recording career.<br />\\"Closer To The Truth\\" grows fast on the lucky listener upon repeated play, filled with a diverse collection of captivating gems each having their own unique feel, soaring & passionate ultimately soul-deep inspired heart & soul vocals from Cher being among the finest of her prodigious recording career...just announced Spring 2014 tour \\"Dressed To Kill\\" is certain to be the must see sold-out event of the season!

B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book brings lots of insights and explanations on how habits are formed and why they stick. It leads you to understand why they are so powerful and different consequences of it for better or worse. It was very mind opening. The author brings examples that shows how it works in people's life - in extraordinary ways -, in corporations and societies, which makes the book go beyond the self help type. Sometimes it was a little boring to read but I had no problems keeping on. It is an interesting book that will make you think about your habits, help you analyze how they work and what you need to do to change them, but at this point I would prefer to have had more help. The formula cue-habit-reward is very interesting but to really change a habit it requires much more that that, it requires a mind changing. So, my feeling is that the book gives you insights and them let you marinate and decide what are you going to do with that.<br /><br />------<br /><br />I wrote that without reading the appendix and it made a difference. In the appendix the author explains how to figure out the routine, the reward and the cues. I still need to try it to see if it works but has completed what I felt was missing. So I'm changing from 4 stars to 5. Very interesting book!
B00EVN2D3O|5.0|This is a great story with a lot of twists and turns.  Well thought out and well acted.  Reminds me a little of &#34;The Usual Suspects.&#34;
B004W1GCNC|5.0|really enjoyed this series. looking forward to the next season. I would recommend this to others also. keep up the good work
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This was a fun movie.  The plot was rather typical, and some of the minor actors could have done better, but the plot was great and the special effects awesome.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|really enjoyed this series. looking forward to the next season. I would recommend this to others also. keep up the good work
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It upsets me that Hugh Howey has been accused of having fake reviews...it really does. Makes me mad! So mad!<br /><br />I know haters are going to hate, but accusing such a great person & author, its just wrong.<br /><br />Don't they see the interactions he has with this readers? How approachable he is, he is the real deal, and I am 100% positive that all the positive reviews that have been left for any of his books are the real deal.<br /><br />I have been a huge fan of Wool since 2010, have loved the entire story from Wool 1 up to Dust. All his books have been amazing, he has created a whole new world, that so many other stories from fan fiction have branched out.<br /><br />If you want a good series to read, please give Wool a shot, you wont regret it.
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|Hate it.  Doesn't work worth a flip.  A BIG waste of money, has a battery you can't change out.  Disposable!!
0802798225|5.0|This book, I couldnt put it down. The views of both sides, the bad boy and the good girl, was amazing. I read all three and I honestly enjoyed every single bit of it. Thrilling, Romance, so realistic! the story was written well!
B00915G6NK|5.0|I never grow tired of this series. The characters are well played, the plots are intricate and hard to figure out some of the time, and every episode holds my attention. This season, especially, had a large amount of suspense and a major cliff hanger.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This film is by far one of the oddest and most enjoyable you'll find. While it is aging it's doing it with style. All the actors really commit to their roles and simply makes this musical a must have.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love the game. If you play it YOU will love it too. I give it a,four star only because,I can't,win actual money.but on,the other hand I'm not losing,money either

B007A4SDCG|5.0|Pressfield is blunt and straightforward when discussing the things that dissuade many from going out and pursuing their goals. Take action TODAY because tomorrow is too late.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. Love the big keys and the easy functions.  I recommend this app to everyone.  Thanks for a great app.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game was so awesome and to be like there is a point in to playing this game it was so awesome.
B000XVK30S|4.0|I am old enough to have watched the Addams Family on television in black and white. We didn't get the channel at home, living in rural Maine, so I had to plan visits to friends in town who had that new-fangled &#34;cable.&#34; I loved the way Morticia wore long black dresses even in the day, and a goth was born. I suppose the movie would be confusing for anyone who did not have cultural references to the television show and its antecedent panel cartoons by Charles Addams, but I enjoyed it. A quick online search shows that there was an animated series I missed entirely. The best part of the movie for me is to hear Raul Julia sing opera.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Advancing the story line involved introduction of many characters, consequently a great many story arcs to follow both in NYC & Idris.  Found myself feeling this was tedious & plodding, but still caring very much about fates of central characters.  Jace & Clary's final scene seemed truncated & tormented.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|This music is both beautiful and inspiring. It is the best antidepressant on the market. It also is very different from anything I heard before. The videos are wonderful!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|LOVED This Book. I started reading it as soon as it downloaded to my Kindle, on the morning it came out. Reminded myself I had to go to work, read it during lunch, and then after I got out of work I started reading it in my car (while not driving) and reluctantly put it down long enough to go home. I finished it that (last) night.<br /><br />I'm a long-time Stephen King fan, and picking up Danny Torrance's life after what happened to Overlook was fascinating. I don't want to get too spoilery (so I won't, but stop reading if you haven't read the Shining yet), but as I've said, I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. It grabbed me in the first few words, starting out right after the Overlook hotel blows up (read the Shining, people!) and following Danny from childhood to adulthood.<br /><br />If you are a King fan AND you loved The Shining, you will love this book.<br /><br />If you haven't read the Shining, you should.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love this dictionary because it is helping me tons in middle school.i would recommend this to anyone who does not know what words mean like me...The New Oxford American Dictionary is always the first thing i think of when i need vocabulary help!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Oh my gosh! it's addicting! Not a big game player...but this one has me hooked.  Love the sound effects and the graphics.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I truly adore this game. My friend Leah got me addicted to playing it 24/7! Every time I am board I get on my kindle and click on minion rush.you really should get this game it is AWESOME!!!!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Cornwell is up to her old tricks. Someone, besides herself, has created a faux pas and she is busy trying to prove he didn't do it. Yet his name and secrets are dragged through the mud. While she admits her attraction to a younger man, she approaches Bennett about his feelings. Almost 3/4 of the way through the novel and she is still arguing about her own intentions and challenging Bennett about his. Cause of death still undetermined; no news of her friend in Alaska. Not to worry as she will tie this all up in the last five pages, leaving the reader confused<br /><br />She is declining into dialogue more than she did before
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love this game, it's totally worth downloading. It is great fun, like the movie . I bet this game will be around for a wile.
B00CATSONE|4.0|So much attention paid to the great American Edison, but Tesla's, portrayed in movies and now in this non-fiction account, is indeed the scientist who deserves so much credit for so many of the innovations from the Gilded Age into the 20th century. I am fascinated by him.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a really fun game better than I thought it would be. I'm getting extra points for doing this. And it has to have the right number of words. Maybe this was a bad idea cause you can't use the same word.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|there are so many one out here and this was my best one I bought I order 4 to have one in each car
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fabulously written prose!  Beautiful flow throughout.  Up there with Mockingbird and Moby Dick on my list.  Highly recommended for everyone.
1878424319|5.0|Great insightful read, life changing, many conversations, shared book with others, recommend to anyone  challenged with spouses, co-workers or friends.
0061122416|5.0|We are told how people perish for a lack of vision/ goal/ dream/Personal Legend, where the<br />magnitude of the dream is irrelevant. However, what's imperative is that a person possesses<br />one. Why do I say this? Because dreams are the language of God. We're all placed here<br />with a purpose and Personal Legend (what we've always wanted to accomplish), with our<br />only real obligation being to realize our destiny. However, as with all things, to whom much<br />is given, much is required. There is a process that one must endure before attaining their<br />dream. The important thing to do is to start, which always entails choices. We must<br />decide, whether we're going to continue with what we've been accustomed to (stay in our<br />comfort zone) or pursue what it is that we really want (expand our territory). The way one<br />thinks always plays an integral part in the process as well. We can either view ourselves as<br />a poor victim or an adventurer on a quest. There are other contingencies involved as<br />well. However, the thing I do know is that when a person really desires something, all the<br />universe conspires to help that person realize his/her dream. God has prepared a path for<br />each to follow, and everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits them. In order to find the<br />treasure we must realize that the only thing holding us back is ourselves , as wells as read<br />and follow the signs/omens left for us.<br /><br />If you're reading this review, I'm sure that you have a dream that's close to your heart or one<br />that has been deferred, or buried. Well, now is the time to exhume that dream, dust it off,<br />and remove it from the shelf. One of the signs that the Creator often gives us before<br />embarking on a great task is a messenger. Well, in this case the messenger is Paulo Coehlo,<br />with his book entitled, The Alchemist, being the Magnus Opus. The book is simple, yet<br />brilliant as it tells the story of a young man in the quest of his dream. It explains the<br />obstacles that inevitably obstruct one's path, and the requisite qualities to face and pursue<br />our dreams, as well as the qualities developed when following our dream to the end. From<br />time immemorial some of the most sublime truths have been communicated to man via<br />myth/ allegories, with The Alchemist being no different. It is chock full of spiritual and<br />practical gems that can be applied to our everyday life. The journey in the book is much<br />like an initiation, where one is constantly subjected to tests of patience and courage. It will<br />remind you that in pursuing one's Personal Legend, it's not about the destination, but<br />lessons accumulated throughout the journey, that we don't have yesterday or tomorrow,<br />only today, how life is generous to those who pursue their Personal Legend, the importance<br />of simplicity, listening to your heart because that's where your treasure is,<br />how the people who love you will never stand in the way of your dream, and that if the<br />Creator brought you to it, He'll bring through it because everything under the sun has been<br />written by One hand. When one is traveling to the promised land, it's inevitable to take a<br />detour through the desert. However, on this particular trip we have Paulo Coehlo<br />conducting us each step of the way. So if you're ready to start on or resume the journey<br />towards your dream/ Personal Legend, I highly recommend picking up a copy of The<br />Alchemist. This book contains something for everyone from high school on up. The only<br />thing left is to observe the signs, rise, follow your conductor, and fear no danger!<br /><br />Maktub
B007EW9ISM|3.0|I read a great review about this stylus which is why I purchased it, but I was not impressed.  When I tried to use it on my ipad mini, it left me with dotted lines instead of readable words.  It seems to work better when held at 90 degree angle instead of a 45 degree angle so depending on how you write or hold your stylus this may or may not work for you.  It has a nice weight to it and feels sturdy.  It feels like you have to press the rubber tip down firmly on the screen before it would seem to make contact and actually write.  (like you would with chalk on a chalkboard)<br /><br />I much preferred the Bamboo stylus and the Adonit Jot Pro stylus I purchased.  They are both much easier to write with as you would use a normal pen and paper.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I loved playing and learning things about the ocean and the plants.  I got to level 29 and started having problems getting the game to load right and respond on the kindlefire .  I have reported this problem for the last two months and still have not fix the problem.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I love SOA! This shoe gets better with each new season! The story lines keep you on the edge of your seat!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Each episode is different and intricate with fun twists. Both main characters are played by high quality actors who grab interest and have me wondering what they are going to do or say next. The characters are as captivating as the storyline.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I'm absolutely obsessed with this show! You don't get much more dramatic than these stories. Treat yourself to some Barbour heaven and watch The Sons of Anarchey from start to this weeks new show! You won't regret one second!
B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is a film with a very simple message, vividly, repeatedly, and wholeheartedly reiterated: the policy of forcibly removing mixed-race aboriginal children from their mothers and educating them in government schools was wrong. Well-meaning, possibly. Probably not vicious or vilely racist (at least as presented in the film). But certainly wrong. The implementers certainly thought they were doing what was best, both for the children and the overwhelmingly white civilization by forcing them to join the Twentieth Century.<br /><br />There are innumerable overlooked wrongs in the past. Enough to keep Hollywood (and all the foreign subsidiaries) busy for many years, and as long as the white characters get portrayed as the villains, there will be a ready market for such films among the American liberal populace.<br /><br />But breaking up families is what was wrong with this policy, and it is what those same American liberals are doing today. All their policies, so cherished and cheered at conventions, diminish the family. Whether it is abortion on demand, abortion without parental consent, state supervision and control of every aspect of a child's life, compulsory schooling--in public schools with no alternative, easy to get divorce, and on and on, the contemporary elite has shafted the family as assuredly as those long dead Australian bureaucrats did. One can only hope that some day their vision will be equally excoriated.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|Was a good movie for family although the special effects were not as good as most . Worth watching but I would rent instead of buying.
0316247545|4.0|Even though that all this time wasn't to be the huge fan of the show, I still do enjoyed reading part of this book(need to read more), it does has some cool stuff and interesting facts that I could be sure it might keep you entertained for a while.<br />Showing info about the characters, story and other things from the show it can be a worth book to read, probably for a while.<br />Kind of surprise to see that the book is small but I guess that can be pass with the content of this book
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|This is a quality effort from one of my favorite all time bands.  Yes I am \\"one of those\\" that still feels that the Mach 2 lineup was the classic one that produced the strongest albums but this album is a little bit of a throwback to that sound. Unlike many people I think the production could have been a little cleaner but still it's the best Purple since \\"Purpendicular\\" IMO.  It's also probably the only DP album since \\"Purpendicular\\" that I will continue to play on a regular basis.  The opening cut \\"Simple Song\\" is DP's best since \\"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\\".  \\"Now What ?!\\" will never replace \\"In Rock\\" or \\"Made In Japan\\" but then again nothing else will either.<br /><br />To bad music in the US is now so dominated by rap and American Idol type pop-rock crap.  Because of this, this album will not get noticed as it should.
0062255657|5.0|Its been a long time since I was seven.  Reading _The Ocean at the End of the World_ reminded me of my seven-year old self, replete with the fantasy, wonder and whimsy that is such an important part of that age.  The story revolves around a now middle-aged man returning to his childhood home.  Of course things have changed, but the memories (and perhaps ghost memories) come cascading back,as  the world is seen again through the eyes and experiences of a child.<br /><br />The adventures and dangers the narrator experiences are vividly and beautifully written as one would expect from Gaiman, who reminds us of the wild imaginings and terrors of things that might not really be there - but maybe they do.  \\"You have to give all that stuff up if you're going to muck about here\\" we are reminded by 11 year-old Lettie Hempstock, the companion and fellow-traveler of our narrator.  But for a moment, we are transported back to see the world through the eyes of a boy just-turned seven.  In the end, Gaiman writes, \\"Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside ... Outside they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing.  Inside, they look just like they always have ... The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups.  Not one in the whole, wide world.\\"  Indeed.<br /><br />I loved the book, although its not without its flaws.  As a previous reviewer noted, there is little character development (we never even learn the name of our narrator), and the blending of philosophy, science and the nature of being are awfully big topics to tackle in a book that is under 180 pages long.  But I was entranced with the story telling, with the open-ended conclusion, and most of all with Gaiman's uncanny ability to reaquaint me with my seven year-old self.  A highly recommended read.
0062012339|5.0|If you love the Crue, this is a great look behind the scenes. Some of the stories you've probably heard about but others are just now being told.
B00824ZJ84|4.0|We were going to the grocery store and my son heard the song Fairytale playing in the car next to us.  He asked what song it was and I had no idea so we went over and asked the girl what she was listening to and then went home and downloaded the album.  Our current favorites are Glitter & Gold, Fairytale and Teach Me How To Be Loved.
B00E3D7WGU|2.0|I played the non Blu-Ray disc through two different players and got the same result as others did- there was NO front right or rear right channel audio despite proper set up for the surround receiver and players.  I see where the Blu-Ray disc is being recalled.  How about the regular DVD too?  It doesn't play properly either.<br />Interscope or Amazon, are you going to recall the DVD disc?  Will a corrected DVD then be released?  Please let me know.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Every aspect of this show is amazing.  It gives such an intimate view of this type of lifestyle as well as the servants below.
B00D7NWTSI|3.0|A silly and harmless movie. I love the Iron Man films, the Avengers, and most superhero movies in general. I was reading Iron Man comic books twenty years ago, so i'm thrilled that not only have the movies been made, but that they've been successful. But this one, for all it's entertainment value, was a misfire.<br /><br />Its not Robert Downey Jr.'s fault at all - he has not phoned in his performance (so far) in any Marvel movie. But Iron Man is supposed to be rooted in something resembling reality. He fought comic book villains in his first two movies, but they were human beings that advanced the technology that Tony Stark created and used it against him. The first two movies were also about mortality, and doing something good with your life with the time you have.<br /><br />This movie begins with the promise of incredibly real reality: a human terrorist. Suddenly, we have a villian who is not superpowered, but very very real. No more Iron Man vs other guys in Iron suits. The movie was about to go in an amazingly brave direction: Tony wouldn't be able to shoot this villian with repulsor rays to defeat him. He'd have to outthink him. What promise! But alas...<br /><br />We get Iron Man vs. Lava Monsters. Silly and absurd. Yes...Iron Man battled with aliens in The Avengers (a fact that i was not thrilled about when i first learned about it, but the movie was so good i just learned to accept it). Yes, i know, they are actually Extremis-enhanced super soldiers who healed from their injuries using genetic abilities powered through superheated inner-core body temperatures.<br /><br />It was a disappointing direction. For what it was, it was fine. But easily the weakest installment in this Marvel Cinematic Universe. Edward Norton's \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is exceptional by comparison.<br /><br />Oh well. I have to own it to make it a complete collection of movies. It's very rare that a superhero movie be sooo bad (Spider Man 3, Man of Steel) that i'd never watch it again...let alone own it. This one i'd watch, if just to enjoy the 3D.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The first step is admitting it lol. This game is better than candy crush any day. I loooove it. I even quit ruzzle to play this.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|It was fun the first couple of times that I played the game but it soon became extremely hard just in the first couple of levels.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It's a real fantastic and marvelous novel. It's amazing that all of the plot will be perfect.  I look forward to reading the final story of this trilogy.
B009R89CRI|4.0|My Grandson is not a reader and we are encouraging  him to read and he seems to enjoy these books.
0446402389|4.0|I took this book with me on a cross country flight and found it very engrossing.  I purchased it at a used book store, so hadn't gone through the reviews here, but I agree completely with what everyone says.  Excellent read.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|It was not what I was expecting at all but it was a fantastic movie. I can not wait to see the second one
B004AV4IF8|5.0|Great album with classics and new stuff. The download was quick. However, I am still having payment confusion issues with the site due to an expired card on file that the system keeps trying to default charges to.
1451638450|3.0|If you are a fan of Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan saga than this will be a fun treat for you.  If you are new to the series, I would start with her earlier works that feature Miles.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I didn't want this book to end, and am awaiting the release of Mr. Bowen's new book. Why? Because he writes simply about the power of love and the amazing cat who taught him that.
0671578855|5.0|This is my all time favorite book in the Vorkosigan saga.  It is very funny and moves quickly.  I would highly recommend.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really well written, it makes you feel like you are watching this cute soup-opera where peoples lives are verging in one another.<br />Nice for what it is
1439133948|3.0|This book was highly anticipated, but ultimately a disappointment to me.  It didn't have the typical Miles craziness and I didn't love the plot.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I just love Supernatural. I never want it to end!!<br />It has some twists and turns. Always to be expected in this series.<br />Love love love it! :)<br />Can't wait to see what happens next.<br />Def. left me hanging!
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|The plot line was very slow to develop - the book just couldn't hold my interest.  Maybe something was lost in translation.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I like that this program has reading, writing, and speaking the language.  It starts easy with pictures to guide you and is Fun !
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Excellent product; simple to use and can also be used for charging other items such as cameras and kindles.  Very convenient to carry since it's weight and dimensions are similar to my smartphone. I highly recommend this product.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My almost 3 year old loved this game. He had a great time with it. Kept him interested for over 15min.
B00A50PBEA|5.0|I highly recommend this production. With some wonderful sets this beloved opera , to me my favorite Mozart- has been placed in a WWI \\"reality\\". Here was an opportunity to have opposing armies come together for a little Christmas party thanks to the transforming effect of the magic fltue and chime box of Papageno. You ought to be somewhat bedazzled by the technical difficulty of this set design. I have no problem with the concept at all..rather nice, , in fact, I'd like to see even more imaginative productions like this one...the Swedish version by reknown film maker Ingrid Bergman is still my favorite so far.<br /><br />I have one complaint, which doesn't take away from this production, except for those of us with white whiskers. It is sung<br />in English. Boooooo.<br /><br />Beverly Sills tried this with \\"La Fille du Regiment\\"..and that too, I hardly caught a single word that was intelligeable. It just does NOT work! To understand this, you sort of have to be that age where the eyesight is not so great, nor the hearing - all of us lose the upper range. Once you arrive at this sorry state, you will obsrve that NO ONE speaks the King's English well!..especially young people who are talking faster and faster and faster with each passing year.Today, any youth could ba an auctioneer...it wouldn't matter if youdidn't understand them...all except for \\"going, going...sold\\"<br /><br />Those of us who sing, know that when we sing in Italian, the best language for singing, period...each and every vowel has a strictly precise shaping of the mouth lips and tongue. There is some variance re.  intonation,,resonating farther back in the<br />mouth and throat, and sometimes forward...all achieved by precision movements and shaping - round for \\"O\\"...wide open for \\"A\\", almost a grimace for \\"i\\" or \\"ee\\"; lips protruding for \\"U\\" \\"oo\\".Italian voice coaches have been known to train young singers for months , working on just the vowels..and then gradually teaching to just touch on a consonant, but touch on it with great clarity! You will know a \\"T\\" from a \\"D\\", or a \\"P\\" froma \\"B\\". You can observe this now ~ that you know...watch great Italian singers, and Spanish ones, of course, Domingo,Jose BRos, Carreras, Caballe, Maria Bayo, etc.,  and you will clearly see the mouth shapes I describe above.<br /><br />Then observe in the \\"features\\" track of this DVD, the interview with the producer and actor kenneth Branagh..watch carefully as he speaks through a narrow slit of lips..bringing the lips together only if he absolutely HAS to...this is how all young people today speak...doing virtually all the pronouncing in the very back of the throat, with barely moving lips.<br /><br />In a word?...\\"Gargling words\\"...gargling! The lips are there for a reason, people!<br /><br />And singing coloratura embellishments and roccoco curly cues, a dozen notes or more on one freaking syllable...and do you think that is understood? it is impossible to understand!..So..my friends with white whiskers...you are forewarned...you absolutely must know the story very well to know what the hell is going on with this production.nant, but touch on it with great clarity!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just wish Google would hurry up with new apps, they're losing people quickly because nothing new has been released lately.
B001458MI2|4.0|I only give this CD 4 out of 5 stars because there are a couple soungs I could easily live without. Christina Aguilera has a powerful voice and is extremly talented. I bought this album because it's one of my favorite works from her. I enjoy the variety of styles and the intergration of the older styles with the new.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Bought these for my husband for gaming. He said they worked great but had some feedback when certain appliances were running in our home. Then we had a baby - dual purpose headphones - they work great with the TV as well so we can stay up and hear our shows well after baby goes to bed. However - the baby monitor cannot be on when these are on due to the crackle/feedback/interference. My only complaint of these headphones. We've had them for nearly 3 years now and they still work well (sans the baby monitor on.)
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Same movie just more computer as I am legend. It took five times of watching to make it through it thanks red bull.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Excellent!  Beautiful voice. Interesting lyrics. It is an amazing album that I cant stop listening to since I bought it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great stuff. Nothing less than we've come to expect from Martin. Can't wait to start the next one. Five stars
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|In my youth, teenage, and now adult existence, I NEVER played those coin fountains, did not see the fun of it (plus the prizes were kind of skimpy). Now I see that there is SOME strategy in dropping the coin(s). The prizes are fun, and I don't have to spend real money!! Adding the rare puzzle piece and this has become an addictive game to play, one that doesn't make me &#34;doze&#34; (sorry, had to say it) off.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the series. I would  highly recommend viewing the entire series if you have missed any of the episodes.
B001BANK32|5.0|After not reading the shining since I was 15. I decided that any constant reader worth his/her salt would revisit a story before moving ahead. Still terrifying. Still vivid. Still impossible to forget.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Brilliantly written. Can be slow at times but is worth the time. Four out of five from a very picky reader.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this book in one day. Mouth dropped the entire time & now I'm going to start the last one.
0399159347|4.0|This book has a lot going on and the beginning was hard to keep track of who was who.  After you figure out the story line and the characters, I thought this was a very interesting book.  I enjoyed the characters and I like that this story is believable.  I wish the ending tied more together.  I though the ending was rushed and left a lot unanswered.  I would recommend this book.
0385344228|1.0|Did NOT like this book!  It was just ok and kept hoping it would get better but it got worse.  The ending was just too much for me.  It went into the recycling container.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|It starts off mystery like but slowly turns to action I recommend this book to any one who likes mythology
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great strategy game!!! Each sickness presents a different level of strategy needed! Worth every penny I paid. Get it now!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Love the music of these guys! Their creativity and talent seem endless.  Easy listening and great sounds combine for awesomeness.
