B000FP2OPY|4.0|<br /> <br /> <br />At first glance (or rather after watching DIRECT-TV's WB Fall Sneak previews) SUPERNATURAL didn't strike me as something I would be interested in. I went as far as thinking it was the 'Buffy Replacement'. Any show I've watched, save MEDIUM, have been victims of Television Cancellation either by the first or second season. (I'm a broken record, I know, just bear with me here). My Mom and Dad were absolutely hyped about this show, yet another reason I wanted to dislike it, and decided to watch when it premiered. After the first and second episode premired, I decided to do the same having given it the benefit of the doubt. Sufficed to say I'm not ashamed to say that the \\"Pilot\\" episode did not fail to reel you in with its opening gambit.  <br /> <br /> <br />The Winchester Family (Mary, John, Dean, and Baby-Sam) are spending what seemed like a routine night together in the house, November 2nd 1982. However things go awry on a routine check on Sam. Mary Winchester, is found by her husband John on the ceiling right above their infant's crib. John is devistated and grief stricken by the tragedy that has fallen on his family. Fast forward 22 years later of the same date in 2005, Sam Winchester is now a senior student in Stanford University and living his desired 'normal' life without his remaining family. Of course his ideal lifestyle is brought to a serious halt when he comes face to face with his older brother Dean Winchester, caught lurking about in his dorm. Granted the neither man is happy to see the other for unforeseen reasons beyond a 'falling out' between the family. Instead of going over old wounds Dean request that his little brother come with him in his search for their Father, who has gone missing. Sam reluctantly agrees and follows his brother. Their fist case together is figuring how several missing people are connected to the urban legend of the Woman in White, Constance Whelch, who is connected to finding their father. From there the series goes from slightly lighthearted blending with an atmosphere  that is truly chilling and stumbles further into darkness that made ANGEL so popular. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />For starters I commend the creators for giving the audience a little insight on the Winchester family life before jumping 22-years-later into the lives of Dean and Sam Winchester. It gave you the sense of familiarity with the characters even if you didn't know them at all. The series Pilot was probably one of the better constructed PILOT-episodes I've seen for WB series. Adrianne Palicki (Kara of SMALLVILLE) as Sam's girlfriend was a nice little role, though I could hardly see the chemistry between herself and Jared, so I wasn't too broken up with her fate, though I could sympathize with Sam afterward. The \\"Woman In White\\" mytho as its foundation was nice. It lalso acked the necessary scare-factor that would otherwise have me saying, \\"the ghost is in the car, run for your life Sam!\\" Which is fine because the latter episodes pick up on the slack and give you an actual reason to shudder. The series itself is a marvel and should please even the most fans who BUFFY, The X-FILES, ANGEL. Early episodes (much like \\"Bugs\\" and \\"Nightmare\\") are set up in the 'Monster/Freak Of The Week' mannerisms but end up being little more than what is first concepted. Each episode's feature creature -- mentioned or shown -- has its own special little quirk based on myth behind it. Or its just completely made up. I especially liked the twist they used for the vampires in \\"Dead Man's Blood\\". The human guised villains (posessed or canibalistic), weren't crafted like the usual 'oversexed' (female-wise) villains that you'd seen in every other television series. Meg Masters is an especially interesting villian introduced in \\"Scarecrow\\". She behaved like a character more focused on achieving the mission and ridding herself of those who stood in her way.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />SEASON I slowly reveals the past of thebrothers, their relationship, and their lives after the death of Mary along with the deteriorating relationship between themselves and John Winchester. The storyline for the series itself is superior to that of any series starting off in its first season, which is surprisingly becoming a trend among the sicence-fiction/supernatural shows. Granted the premise of two brothers searching for their missing father hardly seems like anything worth watching, but thankfully it doesn't focus entirely on this subplot, though its important. The humor, while sparse is amazingly funny (see \\"Hell House\\") and believable. Another thing worth mentioning is the reoccurring nameless 'DEMON'-story arc. This is the true hallmark of the series that will be nothing short of hard to rise above the realms of excellent story telling, especially with the way they left one hanging. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />It takes a while to get used to the Actors/Characters. At first, both brothers will be more than sure to irritate you. After a while you get used to their characterization. Jensen Ackles was just coming off of SMALLVILLE as Jason Teauge (the half baked-boyfriend of Lana Lang) and I had a hard time liking him as Dean Winchester. Jared Padalicki was hailing from GILMORE GIRLS, as Alexis Densisofts, so-called crazy boyfriend Dean Forester. That alone was reason to dislike him. It took a total of three episodes for me to get used to the actors and appreciate them. Nevertheless their acting is excellent and the two play off of each other quite well, thus creating a quirky onscreen chemistry that I never figured would come from either. Jensen as Dean, of course, turns out to be the more interesting Winchester brother. The brash, ever-cocky and overprotective brother who always proclaims to know best. He's always right even when he's not (he man enough to admit at times). If Dean had just been that, I probably would've gravitated more toward Sam. However, he is given much more depth which showcases Ackles dramatic acting quite well. Jared Padalicki as Sam is the usual \\"prodigal son\\" character that gripes about their father's manner of raising them as children (giving him a gun at the age of four-years didn't set well with him), his brother's so-called immaturity, undying loyalty to John, and John's obsession with finding \\"The thing that killed Mom.\\" Thus the Winchester brother's relationship is put to the test through their constant conflicts of opinion. Other times both characters can be unbearably annoying to the point you want to shove a sock in their cakeholes. Jefrey Dean Morgan (JDM) as John Winchester took some time getting use to. As a warily regarded character of the series, John was someone who was hard not to hate -- especially with the way Sam regards him and the fact that his character is not seen again until \\"Scarecrow.\\" Through flashbacks and later episodes you learn to understand John Winchester a little better than before, to the point you pity the man before you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The CGI in the series is much better than SMALLVILLE or CHARMED put together. Like LOST, it at least tries to put effort into little details like floating knives and the supernatural beings. However, like anything, it still shows the familiar irks that tells you a certain scene is computer generated (tch, duh). The original score reeks of the usual TV-esque styled composition if not just better composed than most. You'd notice If you really listened that much to the music going on in the background, which is few and far between the majority of the time. The real musical highlight is the decision to use CLASSIC ROCK songs as opposed to the typical status-quo use of Modern Artists to my great delight. From AC/DC, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Blue Oyster Cult, the majority of the licensed music from the 1970s and 1980s (and beyond) used is pretty good.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[EPISODE LISTING]: <br /> <br /> <br />01.01: Pilot - 3/5 <br /> <br />01.02: Windigo - 3/5 <br /> <br />01.03: Dead in the Water - 4/5 <br /> <br />01.04: Phantom Traveler - 5/5 <br /> <br />01.05: Bloody Mary - 3/5 <br /> <br />01.06: Skin - 5/5 <br /> <br />01.07: Hook Man - 3/5 <br /> <br />01.08: Bugs - 3/5 <br /> <br />01.09: Home - 3/5 <br /> <br />01.10: Asylum - 4/5 <br /> <br />01.11: Scarecrow - 4/5 <br /> <br />01.12: Faith - 5/5 <br /> <br />01.13: Route 666 - 3/5 <br /> <br />01.14: Nightmare - 4/5 <br /> <br />01.15: The Benders - 5/5 <br /> <br />01.16: Shadow - 5/5 <br /> <br />01.17: Hell House - 4/5 <br /> <br />01.18: Something Wicked - 4/5 <br /> <br />01.19: Provenance - 3/5 <br /> <br />01.20: Dead Man's Blood - 4/5 <br /> <br />01. 21: Salvation - 45 <br /> <br />01.22: Devil's Trap - 4/5 <br /> <br />Lastly, another hallmark of the show it the 1967 Chevy Impala otherwise known as the \\"Metallicar\\" by the fans. So all in all, SUPERNATURAL turns out to be another supernatural/thriller worth picking up and watching. It exceeds all expectations and lowers few. If you haven't already seen the this season, now's a great time to pick up. ----- [a 4 out of 5] <br /> <br />(Originally Written in 2006)
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Surprisingly Touching Story Breaths New Life Into the Rocky Franchise
0679423001|4.0|The first two-thirds of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is classic Evelyn Waugh, filled with wit and humor, fascinating characters and provocative scenes, and (above all) evocative description and meticulous prose. Waugh continues his tradition of skewering the pretensions and foibles of the aristocracy--although it's true the Oxford scenes are not as over-the-top as in \\"Decline and Fall\\" (Frank Kermode's introduction notes Waugh's acknowledgment of the 'mood of sentimental delusion' which pervades the work).<br /><br />I have the same reservations, however, about the third part of the book as did many of Waugh's contemporaries, including Edmund Wilson and Conor Cruise O'Brien. While the prose never falters and the \\"plot\\" is fascinating to the end, the satire is set aside for a moral, and your appreciation of the book may very well depend on whether you agree with its underlying religious message. To be sure, I really admire this book and continue to recommend it to everyone, but a second reading showcased what for me are shortcomings--flaws that make the work seem slightly less aesthetically pleasing than Waugh's earlier comic novels (particularly \\"Decline and Fall\\" and \\"Handful of Dust\\").<br /><br />Like, say, Flannery O'Connor or Graham Greene, who present their theology in the complexities of the characters' actions and motives, Waugh famously declared that he intended to show the \\"operation of divine grace on a group of diverse but closely connected characters.\\" Yet, where O'Connor and Greene use their stories to illustrate the subtleties of grace, Waugh seems to be making a case for it--but there are many passages that more convincingly show the operation of authorial, rather than divine, grace. And when he details conversations and debates on secular values and Catholic faith, Waugh can be a little heavy-handed--bordering on didactic. Throughout the dialogue the deck is loaded to demonstrate, for example, that Charles's milquetoast agnosticism pales in comparison to the richness of Catholicism.<br /><br />In fact, the problem with fiction as a vehicle for theological principles is that it can never truly show anything like \\"divine grace\\"; it's necessarily the author who determines what happens to the characters--and why it happens. While Lady Marchmain declares halfway through the book that \\"we must make a Catholic of Charles,\\" and while Julia's near-apostasy and Sebastian's alcoholism interfere with their spiritual salvation, it is ultimately Waugh--not God--who decides their various outcomes. (This dilemma is clearest during a deathbed conversion scene, which tell us everything about the author's hopes and \\"proves\\" nothing about faith. And this episode is based on a real-life occurrence in which, aside from the presence of God, Waugh himself played a coercive role.)<br /><br />This is not to say, however, that Waugh portrays his Catholic characters as saints or their actions as exemplary. Indeed, what saves the novel from becoming a catechism is that Charles, Julia, and Sebastian all are deeply flawed, at times disagreeable people. And, not ironically, the character who (in my mind) is the most lively and lifelike of the bunch is the irrepressible and unapologetic Anthony Blanche. In fact, one might even argue that Blanche's scene-stealing charm is \\"secular grace\\" working its inexorable way on Waugh himself.<br /><br />My comments here focus on only one theme--albeit a central one--in the novel. Most of the book, fortunately, is a comic excursion through a lost age and an elegiac ode to lost youth, as well as a thesis on divine grace. In the final analysis, it's impossible to ignore the beauty of the writing or underestimate the ability of this novel to make one ponder one's own secular or religious beliefs.atholicism.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|This is a fantastic film.  My top tip is:  Don't watch this thinking you're about to see a comedy.  It  suffered at the box office because they tried to market it as a hilarious Will Ferrell comedy, and it really isn't.  That did injustice to his performance and to the film in general.  It was such a realistic, human and awkward performance from Will that I really felt for him throughout.  By the end I was sobbing like a maniac!  The casting is superb and the plot is genuinely gripping.  The overall message of the film is just beautiful.  Definitely my favourite film so far.
B000R7GKQE|3.0|\\"...when the Levee Breaks, Mama you've got to move...\\"      Since the first Season of SUPERNATURAL came to a close, I wondered (like many other fans of this junior series) what would happen during the season premier of the Second season. Granted, what happened was expected and unexpected as more time winded down between the debut and beyond, but all in all SUPERNATURAL - SEASON II wasn't a bad season. It certainly advances in some places and improves in spots Season I kinda faltered on. However, as the season progressed, it steadily fell off the horse sometimes, with a lagging subplot, and heavily bogged down with Angst Episodes that made me crave for what I loved so much about the 1st season: Balance and Solidity. Season II was as skittish and temperamental as the Brothers it focused on. Ironically, if you don't count the many hiatus' this season went on, Season II feels an awful lot shorter than the 1st.      The season stars off rather slowly with the premier episode \\"In my Time of Dying\\", an almost \\"physical\\" homage to Buffy's \\"Normal Again\\" in a sense. In the wake of the Impala's ominous death by T-Bone (curse you Tractor Trailer, curse you!), the Winchesters find themselves struggling to regroup after their battle with THE DEMON and now must cope with the news of Dean's Comatose state, while Dean himself is having an Out of Body Experience and struggles to communicate with his family, whilst a reaper in disguise roams about the Hospital trying to claim the lives of its ailing occupants (himself included). Meanwhile, Sam and John are at odds as to what to about Dean's situation (though John has already made up his mind about he 'had' to do, unbeknownst to either of his sons) and as this episode boils down, the end is probably the most shocking with the departure of John Winchester. And I'm not talking about the so-called 'big-secret' John whispered to Dean. From there, the Brothers are practically back at square one; Dean cuts himself off emotionally from Sam, and throws himself completely into the Hunting gig. Sam is trying to come to grips with his own regrets concerning John and their tattered relationship, while he attempts to get his brother open up and just tell him what's on his mind. The attempt works only on a few rare occasions (once against Dean's will in \\"Simon Said\\". I frown upon this moment, 'cause I don't like it.) and afterward Dean reverts to his now normal status-quo. Sam continues to push until his brother snaps. From there is a cycle of swallow, rinse, and spit (with less punches), with only the occasional reversion back to the Atmosphere of Season I. Even a couple of 'average' episodes makes it way into this season.      SEASON II also decides to continue on with the 'Sam and All The Special Children' subplot that was hinted at in Season I. THE DEMON is making his move on every child, all at the ages of six months, he visited as babies in cribs (or otherwise noted) and is gathering them up or convincing them to do his bidding, which somehow leads up to a 'War' -as so-southern-Bobby so eloquently puts it - or a 'Hell on Earth' kind of Scenario any time an episode addresses this situation. This is basically where this season falls flat. Amidst all the Drama surrounding this big to-do apocalypse, you the viewer, must suffer through redundant rants and complaints from the youngest Winchester, Sam, fearing that he is pure evil (that Dean might have to put him down) and what THE DEMON's plans are for him. Everytime I hit the mute button, silence is bliss. There is also alot Angel-esque brooding from Dean, who seems utterly helpless to help his brother despite his protests otherwise. When John's \\"big secret\\" is revealed, it only gets more redundant from there, almost like being a dead horse. Nothing actually is said or done until the two part Season Finale \\"All Hell Breaks Loose (I-II)\\". But aside from that, the funny-only-time episode \\"Tall Tales\\" and the totally lame \\"Heart\\" Werewolf episode, the Season is not all bad as I make it out to be.      The best parts were probably the ever-present Subplot concerning the Winchesters on the run from local and government Authorities. When the FBI are finally called in, things seem considerably bleak for the brothers with their constant brush ins with the right arm of the law (\\"The Usual Suspects\\" - \\"Night Shifter\\" - \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\"), though they manage to slip under the radar in spite of their publicized criminal records. Another positive, is the introduction of some new characters, Ellen (The amazing Samantha Ferris) and Joanna \\"Jo\\" Beth Harvelle (Alona Tal), and MIT-kick out Ash/\\"Dr. Badass\\". All three work at Ellen's Roadhouse and ironically, have a connection with John Winchester. Or at least, Ellen does, anyway. At first, all three characters feel as though their an intrusion on the series, without really taking any focus off the brothers. The Harvelle's were probably the most irritating in the beginning, especially with the obvious disdain Mama-Harvelle aimed toward the Brothers. Her daughter, Jo, was mildly irritating simply because of her youthful appearance; The unreigned cockiness that radiated off her was didn't help either. She also managed to slug Dean in her first appearance. Which, dude, was so not cool. She practically screamed 'Tough-Girl-Wannabe' at me. But with time comes acceptance for most and I learned to like both characters by \\"No Exit.\\" I hope to see both women in the next season this fall. When they announced that Samantha Ferris would be a regular guest star on the series, I was giddy-stupid with happiness. As an Avid \\"Gundam Wing\\" Fan, it was nice to see the face of \\"Sally Po\\" in full motion instead of staring tiny publicity photo(s) icons. Another positive is the 'calm-before-the-storm' episode \\"What is and Should Never Be\\" - the WHAT-IF Episode I didn't see coming. Its by far by all time favorite episode (arguably the best of the season) of Season II: Jensen Ackles performance is amazing and its a total must watch. The acting from the main cast, is defiantly better this time around, though I may contradict myself with what I'm about to say next. Jensen Ackles gives the better performance as a more troubled and near broken-down Dean Winchester, while maintaining that quirky/humorous side I like about him. Jared Padalecki gives the status-quo performance as the Broody, Self-Tortured Sam Winchester, who is, thankfully almost less annoying in this Season for a time. Both actors continue to maintain their chemistry and the Brotherly-aspect of the show, which is so compelling. The Atmosphere of the series takes a seemingly darker turn in the atmosphere department. In a way, its almost a claustrophobic kind of Despair, that mingles with the Horror, which isn't as strong as before though it manages to creep you out still. The violence and show of blood as upped a notch or two as well, just don't expect heavy-gore; The gross-out factor still remains in most instances. Oh and lastly, there are more Chevy Impala vs. [insert vehicle here] scenes in this season as well. You cannot outrun an Impala villains! ....Unless you own a Mustang GTO, that is.      The tradition of CLASSIC ROCK, with a mix of Modern and Grunge Rock ---SOUNDGARDEN and ALICE IN CHAINS, anyone? Sweet---, is continued and either excels beyond expectations or falters in other cases (Berry White's kinda out of place in this show despite its proper use). The score, composed by Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska, continues to reflect the horror/thriller atmosphere of the show like pros, though its still sounds like made-for-TV music (shuffles feet coyly).      --------    [EPISODE LISTING]:      02.01.

All Hell Breaks Loose Part II - 3/5        All in all, SUPERNATURAL SEASON II turned out to be a promising continuation of a exceptionally great first Season. Its hanging in there with the Best of them ('MEDIUM' [best of a pack] and 'GHOST WHISPERER' [who is steadily improving despite its 'touch by an angel'-ness]). It stumbles and falls, but gets right back up and resumes its 'holier than thou' march into our living rooms. I can only hope that it only improves with time (given they allow it to) and doesn't fall into the ugly pit of 'bad-seasonness' holes Buffy and Angel (among other Supernatural themed series) have stumbled into and had problems climbing back out of. Its pending Second Season DVD release should satisfy fans and newcomers alike. A Highly Recommended Buy. ------[a 3 out of 5]. [6-6-07]
B000HIVO64|1.0|Putting the stickers on the cover was a wicked blast. It took me 20 minutes and I was so proud of my project, I scanned it and sent it to my mom.  <br />The music is typical Beck, the funky side. No \\"Sea Change\\" or \\"Mutations\\" here. It's perfect background noise, too, for like if you're scrubbing your floors or working on a paper or smoking up.  <br />I gave it 1 star because the DVD that accompanies the package is the single most self-indulgent tripe I have ever seen in my entire life. Beck is capable of so much better and THAT'S why I feel so put out. and taken advantage of.  But it's ok, everyone's entitled to a few mistakes and in a career like Beck's, there haven't been many.

B000003TAW|5.0|I was a freshman in high school when this album came out, and, actually, I had to let it grow on me after I bought it.  Now, 13 years later (damn, has it been that long?), it is, in my opinion, one of the greatest rock albums ever made.  I listen to it only once in a while now, but every time I am blown away by the sheer quality of every track.  The nuances of the guitars crunching through some old-school amps, the un-engineered sound of the drums, the genuine-ness of the vocals (does anyone else think Rivers is trying too hard on all their other albums?), all combine to make a perfect rock sound. <br /> <br />No band or album has ever had a bigger influence on my musical preferences.  The only album that even comes close is Jimmy Eat World's 'Futures,' mostly because I deeply relate to most of the lyrics (it's a great album - listen to it). <br /> <br />'Only in Dreams' is epic, with one of the most spectacular slow-build crescendos ever and some sweet guitar and drum-work.  Truly every song on the album is fantastic, and I have a really hard time picking out my favorite, because it changes every time I listen to the album. <br /> <br />Enough hyperbole.  Listen to this album.  Loud.  Then listen to it again.  And again.

0743437497|5.0|I saw Kubrick's The Shining at the ripe age of 5 and was terrified of it for about 9 years or so.  At the age of 14 I began to really watch it and start to enjoy it rather than cover my eyes most of the time.  For years I constantly heard gripe from people who had read the book and said it was so much better than Kubrick's version, so I grew more and more curious. <br /> <br />I finally received it as a Christmas present in 2005.  It is by far the best book I've ever read.  Technically, the story is better than Kubrick's version because it goes deeper into the character of Jack Torrance(but I hold each version as a different story all together.  I still find Kubrick's version more enjoyable). <br /> <br />My first reading of it was fantastic, and after I was done reading it and thought about what I just read, I was a little frightened at times.  With a book, you can actually become the character you're reading about.  With a movie, all that is done for you.  A book is more personal.   <br /> <br />5/5 <br /> <br />
B000002MJ0|5.0|Isn't Anything is seen by many as just a precursor to My Bloody Valentine's next release (magnum opus) Loveless. Although I like this one a lot more.<br /><br />This is a Guitar Rock album without the Guitars. Instead they were stripped down and deleted, only leaving the endless reverb and guitar effects.<br /><br />To me, it sounds like a wonderfully soothing daydream haze. Ahhh yes! That shoegazer 'staring at our shoes' type of sound. This basically defined the genre and My Bloody Valentine were one of it's first and it's best.<br /><br />In 1988 when Isn't Anything was released, MBV came into their own, crafting their sound, defining their basic approach with sensual washes of feedback and influencing upcoming bands like Ride and Lush.<br /><br />Before the Band formed, lead singer/guitarist - Kevin Sheilds was greatly inspired by the wave of noisy US indie underground bands going on in the mid 80s. Bands like Dinosaur Jr, Sonic Youth, Big Black and Husker Du - who showed off the sonic intensity of what the Guitar was capable of.<br /><br />The European audiences were paying attention. And many bands soon followed.<br /><br />On \\"Isn't Anything\\" My Bloody Valentine redefined their earlier sound although they still maintained their 'jangly pop' persona. Just made it more accessible containing tighter structured songs, despite all the noise.<br /><br />\\"Feed Me With Your Kiss\\" (the Hit) is a montague of guitar bursts, heavy drummin', with Kevin Sheilds and Bilinda Butcther's sweet boy/girl vocals.

From the abstract-like pain ridden lyrics on \\"No More Sorry\\" to a sexier but distant voice on \\"Several Girls Galore\\"<br /><br />This darker side can be felt and heard in the chorus on \\"Sueisfine\\" which  goes from \\"Sue is Fine\\" to  \\"Suicide\\" w/o a change in emotion at all.<br /><br />\\"Soft as Snow\\"(But Warm Inside) opens with a Drum countdown....to Deb Googe's funkified bassline, while B. Butcher backs Sheilds with her sweet soundin and sexy OOoh Oooh - like a Ambulance siren is set off.<br /><br />\\"Lose My Breath\\" is just a pure daydream to listen to. So soothing and peaceful. Probably my Favorite track on all of \\"Isn't Anythings\\" 38 minutes.<br /><br />Unfortunately Loveless was the last album by My Bloody Valentine back in '91. Leaving in their wake one of Rock's great what-if's. Kevin Sheilds has been saying for years he is interested in a future project with the Band, but who knows when that would be. Oh well...<br /><br />-Isn't Anything is a creative innovation, spawning many similar bands afterwards, but few could compare to it's genius and the Band behind it.B.

0783231032|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" this funny movie on theatrical cut VHS many years ago and laffed alot.  The directors cut does not diminish the pace.  The DVD re-issue of the old Laser Disc in widescreen is OK but Universal gave the public a non-anamorphic version for 16x9 televisions (BOO on Universal!!). This is a collectors version???? Phooey!  The zoom setting on projection TVs mess with the period style photography so I watch it on the 4x3 and the picture is sharper despite the purposeful soft, foggy 60 years ago \\"look\\".  Everyone in this production does a fine job, it's too bad the more positive reviews in Europe were not included.
B00004HYLF|5.0|What can I say to do justice to this masterpiece of an album. <br /> <br />The previous reviews go deep into each songs so I want to share what is was like to have discovered this music in my High School years.  I wore out my vinyl, then my cassette tape, and my last CD copy of this insane album.  And to think that Al Di Meola was just 21 at the time... <br /> <br />I had the pleasure to see them at Universal Amphitheatre in North Hollywood (now called Gibson Amphitheatre) when I was in High School. Although a bit past my time, I was lucky enough to find older friends into RTF and other great music of the 70's explosion of incredible musicians and collaborations. <br /> <br />Bunch of us saved up some money for the tickets (among other mind enhancing materials) and managed to get good seats, in front of Lenny White, who oddly set up his batteries to the left of the stage. <br /> <br />I'm a guitarist primarily so I was interested in seeing Al doing his demonic leads but ended up mesmerized by Lenny White's endless rolls and phase-effected drum sound.  These guys were so adept at their instruments, I can see the creativity just oozing out of them as they improvised through the evening, featuring most of the Romantic Warrior album and some of their previous hits, with full command of their instruments and facial expressions. <br /> <br />The concert was so influential for me that I had gone head-long into the world of Jazz Fusion and my guitar playing also changed direction from Robert Fripp / Eno to the world of Jaco, Al, John \\"Mahavishnu\\", Allan Holdsworth, & Gambale. <br /> <br />There are only few vinyl albums I've worn out over the years and this is one of them.  It is truely one of the best Chick Corea albums of all time. <br /> <br />It still sounds fresh and causes me to start air drumming in my car, despite the funny looks from the other cars. <br /> <br />Enjoy !
B0001ZXM54|5.0|If anyone gave this cd set less than a five star rating then you need to spend more than $49.95 on your audio gear. After listening to the entire set, both cds, this ZZ Top collection is some of the best remastered audio I've heard. It displays as \\"HD CD\\" on the processor and is SACD quality sound. Every track is balanced with parallel volume levels and the recording does not sound like a collection of greatest hits as much as a new recording that was performed in the studio for this release. All thanks to Bill Ham. Audiosnobs take note, this is a great listen.... \\"they gotta lota nice girls....\\" <br />

Recommended.
B000P2A256|5.0|You have to be absolutely insane or just not a lover of good music if you think this CD is not good! I have both CDs and a VERY big Maroon 5 fan and have to say that I am ashamed of the folks who call themselves true fans. So what if there are a few \\"fillers\\" on the CD (honestly I can only think of TWO on the whole dang CD). I have not bought a CD as of yet that does not have a filler or two on it. Open your eyes and ears to a somewhat different but still good sound because that is exactly what this CD is!
B00005JNQS|5.0|We sat together as a family right after supper, the 3 of us were enthrolled with the plot, the actions but the characters as well. <br />Human characteristics very apropiate, specially since cast are \\"robots\\".I feel this movie is great for young children as well because role models are clealy established from the start. Our highly functional autistic son truly enjoyed it. Halle Berry is superb. <br />

0684847817|5.0|This is another great book by Brian Froud. Beautifully illustrated, as I've come to expect. I like the way that the good fairies are on the front of the book, and the bad fairies start the same way, but on the opposite end / side. Very interesting idea.
B000000IUK|5.0|Whether it was the Beatles or the Stones who sang these songs they would have been great.However, with the strong guitar leads of the Edge and the impassioned vocals of Bono, this album becomes magnificent! There is a reason this is one of best selling cds ever and one of the top 20 rock albums ever, find out why.
B000002KB8|5.0|The eponymous \\"Black Sabbath\\" debut is the gothic grandaddy of them all. This release gets 5 stars not only for the music, but also for it's influence on so many other bands over the years. There is a refreshing simplicity to the production of this album, as evident in the absence of keyboards or extensive multitracking. What we are treated to are almost \\"live\\" in the studio recordings, created by 4 hungry musicians who probably had no idea what they were on to. The idea of making this record as dark and gothic as it is was a brilliant and original idea for the time, although it has been duplicated so many times that later generations of listeners may take the ingenuity for granted. For example, the opening track, \\"Black Sabbath\\" is so rich in gothic heaviness that even King Diamond would flee with devil's tail between legs. Even Ozzy's voice sounds much deeper, earthy, and sinister than later releases. Other songs, such as the classic \\"Wizard\\", complete with Ozzman's harmonica, capture an uncommon groove that is tough to come by with Sabbath. The classic \\"NIB\\" is a perfect closer to side one of the vinyl. The album cover art is especially creepy,mysterious, and very appropriate. Overall, this album sowed the seeds of what would later become heavy metal.

B00005JPAO|4.0|Definitely a different perspective on the events surrounding the death of Diana.  A little slow moving, but still very good.
B000002UAU|5.0|I won't even pretend that I could write an objective review about this work because every song is so tied  up with many memories of that time in my life, with this music always (it seemed)playing in the background. The Beatles were a seminal musical force in my life and their lyrics and arrangements resonated deeply with me.<br /><br />  I do, however, have one suggestion. Even if Paul was never your favorite \\"Beatle\\", check out his newest work \\"Memory Almost Full.\\" It is the most recent Cd that I think hearkens back to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and it is likely to give you an attack of nostalgia, since he sings of times gone by - at least, in some songs.  The musical arrangements are very similar, too.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins is intelligent and articulate while making common sense to any thinking person.  A must read for anyone wrestling with their belief system.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I remember the first time I heard the first single from this album \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\", on the radio.  It was about as basic as rock could get, but there was something about it that made me sit up and take notice.  A few weeks later I saw the band perform on Saturday Night Live and again I was impressed.  Yes, they were mining the same 70's style rock territory that many before them had done, but there was just something about these guys that appealed to me.  I picked up the album and pretty much liked every song on it.  Jet doesn't really do anything original.  A direct line to their music can be traced from older bands like The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Faces, Golden Earring, Oasis and maybe even a little Pink Floyd in spots.  Instrumentally they are pretty basic too, with decent enough guitar and rhythm section.  But.....there is something about these guys that gives their material instant listenability.  Along with \\"Be My Girl\\" the album produced a couple of other huge radio hits the ballad \\"Look What You've Done\\" and the rocker \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\".  Both are great little tracks that were perfect radio music.  The rest of the album is all strong as well.  I really like every track.  It will interesting to see how long these guys stick around on the charts.  I can see them possibly coming and going fairly quickly, but for this album at least, they have put out a winner.  This is one of my favorite discs to crank up in my car.  Great retro stuff.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This dvd is awesome! The graphics and sounds are wonderful!!! It is a very well put together program.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Hatari is one of those unexpected pleasures you find on basic cable. I first saw this movie on a local channel one Saturday afternoon. I only watched because it had the Duke in it. What I took from the movie was a fast-paced adventure which didn't minimize toughness, but didn't emphasize violence. A great deal of adeventure movies features violence and gore, not just plain, sturdy toughness. This movie features manly toughness without any embellishment or crudeness. Just a bunch of confident guys getting a tough job done without complaint. The plot is light, but not far fetched. The plot focuses simply on people doing their job (a job that is enjoyable) while interacting with one another. The movie doesn't need to go further than that because it is entertaining and enjoyable. Bit of trivia - Wayne and the others caught the animals themselves. Look at Wayne's mouth during the catch sequences; they are obviously dubbed over because Wayne cursed too much at the animals.  Anyway watch this movie, it's a real treat!!!!
B00008BRB5|2.0|Whoa, what a bad album. The Police, who were formerly a respectable little reggae-rock band, go adult contemporary. Every song but one is mellow, harmless, and slathered in ambient keyboards. I don't think that's what most Police fans wanted to hear from the group - I, for one, would rather listen to \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\" or \\"Message in a Bottle\\" than \\"Mother\\" (which I think might be the most universally despised Police song, their \\"Dogs of War\\", if you will, and it's not like I'm giving it my vote of confidence), \\"O My God\\", \\"Walking in Your Footsteps\\" or \\"Tea in the Sahara\\". The only song that isn't white bread pop, \\"Synchronity 2\\", is a great reggae-rocker, and a deserved Top 40 hit. The good news is the three major singles, which do the same atmospheric thing but are far more successful with it: \\"King of Pain\\" sports a stunning solo from Andy Summers; the disorienting #1 \\"Every Breath You Take\\" (which might as well be Possessive Stalkers Anonymous' anthem) has so many brilliant arranging details that even its near-endless radio play simply cannot diminish its virtues, and \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" has got to be my favorite song on the album; its dreamy keyboards and Caribbean production make it downright scary, and is that not a hugely catchy refrain? But there are too many turkeys contained, and you can find the four classics on any Police collection worth talking about. Why buy it when the other four are so much better?
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble's newest CD is absolutely terrific!  He can easily sing the oldies of top singers and still make it his own!!  Highly recommend this one! <br /> <br />L. of WI
B00064WSNW|5.0|This is such an awesome CD full of interesting sounds and rhythms!  I had it years ago when it came out and had it stolen.  Lately I kept thinking about it and decided to purchase the new remastered CD.  It's just as good as ever!  In fact I think I appreciate the work and the quality of the recording even more now. <br /> <br />Tony Levin's bass is phenomenal!  Sometimes it's interesting just following his bass playing.  Outstanding!  Whether he's with Crimson or with Peter Gabriel he's fantastic.  Definitely one of the best bass players I know of along with Chris Squire.  And talk about guitar work.  Fripp and Belew do some outstanding, very interesting work here.  Kind of Al Di Meola on acid.  Bill Bruford is excellent!  I read a review where someone apparently doesn't think much of Bruford.  I've seen him perform in a couple of different groups like Genesis and Yes and he's alway been able to flow with a progressive band well.  He provides a great foundation for the music here. <br /> <br />Highly recommended if you are in to strange music and progressive rock styles.  My favorite King Crimson CD.  I don't know if this is classified as progressive rock but whatever it is, I like it a lot!  One to crank up!  Sometimes I take it out and play little games like looking at it and then not looking at it, just to see if I still like it.  I DO!
0743454537|5.0|What a well written, emotional and thought provoking novel.  I liked the way the chapters were written, from the view point of each family member and the other adults involved.  It's an excellent way to get to know the characters well and I felt quite attached to most of them, although not Sara so much.  However her address after she drops her papers in court and speaks from the heart moved me.<br /><br />I could relate to the medical procedures and symptoms, the need for a sense of humour as well as the fear involved, having had a sibling with leukaemia and it certainly sparked off some discussion with my twin daughters and their elder sister as to what we would (hope to) do and why, as well as the mixed and moral feelings involved.  That however wouldn't be the same as being born specifically to be a donor but was interesting nonetheless.<br /><br />The end I wasn't expecting at all...but whilst it certainly shook the story up I felt it was a more intelligent way for the novel to go.  Both ironic and shocking making us think right up until the last about how precious life is and how easily it can be unexpectedly snuffed out.  How one of the characters worried about the expected...only to have the unexpected happen and lose something equally precious to them that they'd never even considered in jeopardy.
0800141660|5.0|This adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility was an exceptional one. With the starring cast who could hardly go wrong. Enjoy!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|Original version of the story, still a must see though
B000PFUAO6|4.0|This is not my favorite Dream Theater CD, by far. I prefer Awake, SDOIT, and Images and Words to this. None of the songs are perfect on this CD, and I can't say that for the other DT CD's mentioned (especially Awake). While there are good moments on the majority of the songs, there are also a lot moments that have already been done on other DT songs. That's not to say there are no good songs on this CD, it's just that parts of some songs aren't original and get quite boring, as all songs on this CD are quite long. I like this CD, but it's not as good as it could have been. I suggest buying it and seeing what you think, just don't get your hopes up. <br />
0060989157|5.0|This book is a real page-turner.  Even at over 400 pages, I read it in three settings.  What surprised me the most about the book was the honesty that the guys put in, revealing their own insecurities and vulnerabilities.  Of course, there's plenty of raucous partying to balance that out. <br /> <br />What I enjoyed most was the narrative style.  The book is basically a compilation of interviews with the band members and others who became part of the story.  I like how you can get multiple perspectives on the same event.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I loved this movie. I remember watching the first one when I was a teenager and I loved it then. All the conversations where real and intimate. I hate movies where the two people fall in love and you can't really tell why because they hardly ever talked to each other. In Before Sunset you see how their words really effected the other person. I love the way they captured the realistic discomfort and timidness of meeting a lost love and through time seeing the longing of what could have been. Very realistic in its conversations and feelings. I loved it.
B00005T7I1|5.0|A good movie with lots of known players.  Good clean fun. Brings back the good old days.  Enjoyable.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|So few people actually buy cds nowadays. Believe me, I understand. So many concepts are \\"borrowed\\" that it's hard to find anything that's really new. As it goes, I think that you can always look to the Chili Peppers for great music, and a unique sound. This album raises that very standard. The sheer volume is bound to move copies. 28 songs for less than $20? Naturally, every song isn't a masterwork, but the whole album is certainly worth a listen. <br /> <br />In a changing world, it's good to have a few constants. The Red Hot Chili Peppers remain unchanged. Still as mind-blowingly awesome as the day they burst on the scene. In an industry where it's easy to sell out, or lose yourself, they haven't. I think that they deserve credit for that. If I can go as far as to say, \\"I think Stadium Arcadium can be dubbed The New Classic Rock.\\" Simply put, Buy this album! <br />
B000J4QWMC|3.0|I enjoyed this one at the movies, but this new cut is much better. A real treat, very stylish. great extras on this disc too.
B000OPPSXK|5.0|Finding these symphonies collected, remastered, and at value price- not to mention back in print- is truly exciting. Krips proves himself a energetic and thoughtful Mozartian, and the Concertgebouw Orchestra (especially the strings- what a lush and layered sound. Wow!) is nothing short of amazing. These symphonies were recorded over different sessions in '72 and '73, but the transfers are warm, vital, and really generously show the depth of this great orchestra. A friend turned me on to Krips' work just recently, and I must say that this set must share some space on the shelf with some of the greatest recorded Mozart symphonies I have heard. A treasure!
B00002MZ12|5.0|This is an amazing collection of rarely heard tunes, done in an MTV setting, simple and mostly acoustic.  I would strongly recommend this CD for even the most timid Alanis fan, but it has universal appeal.
B000NQPZCO|5.0|I loved this movie when it originally came out. The casting is spot on and this Blu-ray edition shows it off like it was meant to be seen. A definite must have for any fan of Depp, Pacino, and mobster flicks.

B00000255F|5.0|Born to Run is an incredible work---by far one of the best rock records ever made.  It remains timeless too---year after year.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Of course, I dig the movie.  But does anyone know why Criterion Collection costs twice as much?  Thank you.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|it's a dark dark film and the viewer doesn't really get to put the pieces together until the end of the film. I think if you read most of the reviews before seeing this film it will, for the most part, spoil it, since many of the reviews let the cat out of the bag. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Beautiful movie to look at.  I remember a scene where a girl asks the main character why things can't go back the way they were.  And he walks away smiling....not laughing at her or anything, but a smile born from pain and understanding how fleeting love can be.
8590379825|5.0|The Lua programming language is among those gems appearing once per decade. It has a simplicity and rigor which may make other well-thought languages (such as Prolog or Scheme) pale a little.    Simple without being simplistic, Lua takes you to a new level of productivity. This is *true* productivity flowing from the essence of a well-designed language, miles away from the well-known plethora of wizards and libraries that take you months to master in order to become \\"productive\\".    With Lua you do not learn a language, you simply learn a direct, simple and natural way of doing things. Lua \\"clears your mind\\", just like Prolog does - but in a different way (see \\"The Art of Prolog\\" by Sterling & Shapiro). Few programming languages boast such quintessential brilliance.    The author of this language is truly a genius of language design and most likely the years to come will prove it. I would not be surprised that after a decade or two Mr. Ierusalimschy will be cited among folks like Sussman or Colmerauer.    How \\"Programming in Lua\\" is written shows off that it was produced by the same mind which conceived Lua itself.    Good, well organized, concise without being too dry, showing good explanations without being too verbose, this book makes you not only learn while reading, but also to envision solutions to your programming tasks while learning.    One last thing: I did *not* read exactly this book. I've read only the first half of edition 1 online, but it is enough to understand what Lua is all about.    Needless to say that I ordered a copy of the second edition - surely equal in quality.

B00006AW2M|3.0|What a surprise this cd is! While most of the reviews give it five stars (nice touch, Amazon, by the way with the new look of the review pages), outside of Amazon, it is arguably the most slagged off Stones' effort in their history. While it is not their greatest by a long shot, it is better than many I've long since owned and listened to. I finally gave in to buy this and was really glad that I did. Despite being a Stones' head for over three decades, I have avoided owning this, largely due to my  dislike of psychedelia as well as the enormous amount of derision it has received. Man, was I wrong! This cd knocked me out right from the first listen. What blows my mind so much is the fact that this is a disc which, despite the psychedelic influence, contains some very strong guitar work. good melodies, nice acoustic work, prototypical Keef riffs, and a handful of songs that sound like they could've easily been on the follow-up to this (Beggar's Banquet). From all I'd read about it, I was expecting the Stones meet Pink Floyd, but at the core, this album stays true to the Stones. Yes, the eight plus minutes of Sing This All Together (See What Happens), a reprise of the opening number, is loaded with plenty of LSD influenced nonsense, but there are arguably more trippy and clearly more ridiculous things on Between the Buttons, a critically well-received album released the same year this nugget was released.<br /><br />In short, I can not urge you strongly enough to investigate this disc on your own. While it might seem as if I'm damning this album with faint praise, let me say that I sincerely believe you won't be disappointed. It may never be your favorite Stones recording, but I doubt very highly that it would ever be considered your least favorite either.
B00005JPMC|3.0|For a thriller fan like me, \\"Shooter\\" looks like a modernized, post 9/11 version of \\"Three Days of Condor,\\" made about 30 years ago. The difference is that \\"Shooter\\" is not about bookish Robert Redford; it is about Bob Lee Swagger played by Mark Wahlberg, retired ace sniper living quietly with his dog. One day Bob is visited by three men in black suit (including Danny Glover) who coax him into another mission, that is, to prevent a rumored plot of assassinating the president of the United States. <br /> <br />Anyone who knows some basics of thriller would soon know what follows after that. Of course Bob shouldn't have left his mountain cabin. He is in for big trouble, of which nature should not be disclosed here ... well, but you may have already known that). To survive, Bob enlists help from Nick Memphis, disgraced FBI agent (Michael Peña) and Sarah Fenn, ex-love of his former partner (Kate Mara), with \\"enemies\\" at his heels. <br /> <br />The film's script begins with an intriguing premise that would remind us of \\"JFK,\\" but it gradually becomes clear that though slick and engaging, \\"Shooter\\" does not offer anything new much. Antoine Fuqua (\\"Training Day\\" \\"King Arthur\\") manages to keep the ball rolling, and he knows how to set up the right mood for each moment of the story with a blend of snappy actions including car chases and shootings, and the beautifully-shot photography.  <br /> <br />Mark Wahlberg who keeps playing touch guy roles these days, and Michael Peña are both very good though even their fine acting cannot make us forget the fact that the script has so many plot holes and implausible events. Kate Mara and Rhona Mitra appear, but their characters are there to further the story; once it is done, they are forgotten until the next occasion. <br /> <br />\\"Shooter\\" is a roller coaster of actions with one stoic, invincible hero in center and a bunch of villains waiting to be his next target. It is not a classic, but still entertaining with the director's inspired visual sense and a string of decent actions.
B000O179A4|4.0|Well acted storyline with a great performance from first timer Jennifer Hudson. When you're in the mood for a musical this picture will not disappoint. Eddie Murphy is very versitile  and it was good to see him act in a serious role. Kudos!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My son, 28, introduced me to this failed series and guided me as we watched the DVD's recently. This \\"outer space Western\\" has richness, chemistry, surprises, excellent writing and acting, sexual tension, humor...in other words, everything. It takes a bit of patience to get the full back stories on all the characters, thus a guide who has seen the episodes already is a big plus. Once you catch on, however, how can you not be hooked? One of the nicest surprises I have discovered in recent years, this set is a must for any lovers of \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" or Westerns or fans of skilled acting and writing.
B000O76T86|1.0|Just received this and it DOES NOT have DTS. Very disappointing. Nothing different or special about this edition. Do not waste your time.

It was recommended by a phych professor who specializes in this subject and also a neuro scientist at a top medical school who also studies the inner workings of our crazy brains.

Great acting by the two leading male stars whose competion between themselves keeps you watching. The end was quite a surprise and it made me watch the movie several more times to try and spot the secret. Well worth the price and it's one you can enjoy over and over again.

B00008DDSC|3.0|James Spader must be one truly sexually disturbed man. Most of his work seems to revolve around men whose proclivities are far from healthy. From Crash to Sex, Lies, and Videotape, James Spader seeks out sexual encounters that are distant, shallow, and self-destructive as well as demeaning. He continues in good form here in a rather entertaining piece on sado-masochism. Sexual harassment be damned!
B0000067L3|5.0|This album really epitomizes what Cream was about.  They were both marvels live and in the studio, and never was that shown better than in this album.  Jack Bruce and Peter Brown were amazingly prolific writers, and their best songs are all here.  White Room is deserving of its classic (with a really good, intricate drum workout by Ginger Baker), and As You Said is another gentle, charming song.  Passing the Time is really beautiful (showing Baker could write great songs too).  I love Politician, whose chorus \\"I support the left, though I'm leaning, leaning to the right\\" still rings true today.  The live stuff is phenomenal, especially the epic cover of Spoonful and Bruce's blues workout Train Time.  The only song I could do without was Toad.  It starts out well, but Baker's drum solo isn't very dynamic, and it goes on much too long.  If Baker and Bruce had gotten along better (contrary to popular belief, it wasn't Clapton feuding with his other band mates, but Baker and Bruce, who had a bit of a history before Cream), Cream would have kept making great albums for a while.  Nevertheless, this is a great album, Cream's best.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This isn't Hill Street Blues, Law and Order, or any other program which show cops to simply be overworked yet loyal and dedicated to their job. We see corruption, strange alliances between cops and crooks, and a violent environment into which anything can and will go wrong. The center of this universe is Vic Mackey, a detective who is willing to not only bend the rules but break them in order to bring order to Farmington, and peace is not always achieved by bringing the bad guys to justice.<br /><br />There are many out there that laud NYPD Blue as the premiere cop show of the last twenty years. I call shenanigans on that. Watching Sipowicz suffer through virtually every problem possible TWICE and the revolving door of partners only served to gradually dilute what was once an edgy show. When the only surprising event is whose butt is going to be bare next you know a show is no longer worth watching.<br /><br />In contrast, The Shield in its six year history has kept up an environment where one is never sure exactly what is going to happen. People die unexpectedly, are raped, robbed, beaten: this is the real streets brought into your living room.<br /><br />If you want a glimpse of what the thin blue line is really protecting you from, I suggest you take a look. After this series, I can never go back to Law and Order.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Amo la musica. En todas sus vertientes, mientras me parezca buena. Y eso me ha convertido en un buscador de perlas dentro de lo grabado aqui y alla. No he podido encontrar algo que se acerque siquiera un poco a este concierto. Se lo he mostrado a teen agers que nada sabian de esa epoca  esa musica. Y se les volo la cabeza. Sin excepciones. <br />En un marco tecnico y conceptual de primer nivel (sonido/video/bonus/ disenio) El concierto se desenvuelve con una coherencia y calidad inusuales. Uno de los secretos de talking heads es una increible habilidad para generar melodias que no pueden sino tararearse tras escucharlas un par de veces, con una base ritmica ante la que es imposible no mover el cuerpo. Y no hablo de musica disco. hablo de una creatividad acompaniada de un concepto musical extraordinario. No pueden perderse este concierto. Es casi un pecado.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|The best documentary ever produced!! This is a collection of 5 DVD showcasing the footage of all aspect of life on earth shot in hi-def camera. I was looking for this type of documentary for many years. I have a good collection of different documentaries and I would say this set is my favorite. At the end of each session, BBC is showing behind the scene activities depicting how that session was shot. We do not realize what goes on behind the camera and what hardship the crew goes through to shot the animal documentaries, and this provides a good perspective on that. <br /> <br />Overall - crisp picture quality, superb sound, some of the most awesome footage ever shot and on top of all David Attenborough's narration (I have heard that in some set Sigorney Weaver has provided the narrative). This documentary will leave you speechless with marvellous photography. I am HIGHLY recommending this. I promise you will watch this again and again and again......
6305546789|4.0|When John Carpenter gave form to \\"The Shape\\", aka Michael Myers, he crafted a chilling story of suspense around this murderer. Before the stupid \\"sister storyline\\", the attempt at turning Myers into some supernatural bogeyman, or the reboot which only tarnished the original further (Sorry, but Jamie Lee has definitely lost what acting skills she once had), there was the tale of a child who simply was...evil. He came home on Halloween night to relive the horror of his first murder. He was not a man. He was, pure and simply, evil. Now why did we need to know more than that?
B000O599WG|5.0|Recall seeing this first run when I was too cool to be a John Wayne fan. And this flick converted me, big time. Good story, interesting characters, great shoot out at the end, and John was never better, being John. And that's no put down. Not the critical or visual masterpiece that was the Searchers, but a more affiable outing for our hero. Action, humor and character development.
0142405787|5.0|I thought that this was a very great book.  Anthony Horowitz used great plot twists to really bring out a sense of adventure in the book.  Also, the charqctes  were really realistic, with great description.  The clifhangger ending could have been improved, but overall it was very good.  The Alex Rider character was like a normal boy, just as he would seem in real life.  This was a very good book.  I wuld recomend it for ages 10-16.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Frankly, I don't share as much enthusiasm as others, but all in all, I would say that this is a good movie. I can't imagine why so many people can't help but constantly compare this movie to \\"The Prestige\\" when with the exception of the magical theme they are nothing alike. First of all, the illusions that are done in this film are absolutely amazing, but yet they reveal nothing to the audience about how they were done. The magic tricks in \\"The Prestige\\" pale in comparison to the illusions you saw in this film. Secondly, the premises are totally different. Thirdly, the ending of \\"The Prestige\\" is still somewhat of an enigma to me. I guess it's just a matter of the way a person interprets things. I really like movies with endings that surprise you, or make you think about what you just saw, and this ending doesn't disappoint. For me, I think the ending (which I won't reveal) and the illusions are really what sold this film. Of course, Rufus Sewell, Jessica Biel, Paul Giamatti, and the always excellent Edward Norton are amazing as well. With that being said, I'm still not jumping up and down. Again, I think this movie was good...not AWESOME!
031286504X|5.0|Stephen King once wrote, \\"[W]ithout Richard Matheson I wouldn't be around.\\" Many authors can make the same statement. Matheson's work has greatly shaped the horror genre, and his novel I Am Legend has been one of the most influential stories of his time.<br /><br />One of the best things about the book is Matheson's portrayal of the vampire.  These creatures are ravenous and feral and widespread; they have taken over the earth.  They act much like zombies--or rather, zombies act like them: George Romero admits that Matheson's I Am Legend inspired his zombie apocalypse in Night of the Living Dead.<br /><br />Matheson also contributes an interesting scientific explanation for the vampire outbreak. Robert, the protagonist, turns to books in his quest to understand the pandemic, and his discoveries explain everything from why the infected avoid garlic to why they crave fresh blood. His search for knowledge lends the novel a pragmatic feel emphasized by simple, clear-cut writing.<br /><br />There are many reasons why genre masters such as Stephen King and George Romero credit Matheson as an influence.  I Am Legend is definitely one of them.

1932100660|5.0|Amazing book. It tells you the answer to it all. No need to know anything else... this is it, and it is so simple. Nature is so complex that it provides the simple answer.  It really took the author 40 years to write this book! It is interesting even dramatic, well written and a thick book, full of the real stuff. Everything else is mostly noise. This is the Best book on health ever written period ... and I have about 50 health books. Read it with Caldwell Esselstyn's book, another amazing book, but specifically written on the issue of heart disease. They sort of go together as both authors refer to the other book, China Study is more broad on many health fronts, with much more information, much longer.

0143036556|5.0|Someone once described history as \\"one damn thing after another,\\" and sometimes the way history is taught might make it seem that way.  Diamond's approach is to look for patterns.  His particular focus, both in this book and in Guns, Germs and Steel, is to look at the human-envornmental interaction.  In this book he mentions a few times that he is not an economic determinist, although in his previous book he gave the impression that the rise of the West is largely due to environmental factors.  In the present book he shows how a set of environmental factors creates a challenge and that the response to that challenge can make the difference between a society that flourishes and one that falls apart.<br /><br />I must confess at this point that I have not read the entire book. At some point I skipped the earlier histories to read about the present. At 500 pages of tightly written but nevertheless readable facts and figures the book gives a bit more than I care to know about such things as the cultural relationships in Norse Greenland. Still it must be said that the methodology is rather interesting.  Diamond shows how archaeolologists and scientists can recreate the history of a people even when there are no written records. I admire the energy expended in piecing together all the information and urge you to read through at least some of the case histories.<br /><br />The tone of the book is cautionary but hopeful.  The message is that we are facing very serious global environmental problems and that, based on the historical evidence, can either ignore the problems to our great peril or else collectively respond to them to our mutual benefit.

B000OCXM68|5.0|I have all of Michael's CD's & DVD's & am madly in love with his music.  His personality shines through on every song.  I have never liked the song Mrs. Jones before (actually hated it) but Michael's version of it has made it my favorite on the CD.  One thing I can not understand though - where did the lisp come from?  It wasn't evident on any of the other CD's or DVD's before.  It threw me through a loop at first but being such a fan the music finally won me over.  It's a mystery to me - but I still Love the man - Love the voice.<br /><br />Jeanine

B000O5AYCA|5.0|When did rock music get so beautiful again? Yeah, It had something to do with folks getting sick of garage rock (White Stripes aside) and critics never forgetting the heartbroken punk of Joy Division. But it also came from the alt country invasion of the 1990s, the dawning of Wilco World and the success of such over-played buggers as U2 and Coldplay.  <br /> <br />But really, the fusion of rock and, gosh darn it, gorgeousness, has gotten pretty pervasive of late, with dudes like Andrew Bird and groups like our dear, overhyped Arcade Fire. But I'd argue that the masters of the Rock Can Be Pretty Without Being Awful movement are Brooklyn outsiders the National. If you like moody, wry rock, I dare you not to fall in love with this record. It trumps Wilco, and it makes Interpol look chilly and terribly detached from the real world. <br /> <br /> I came to The National's game, like so many people, with 2004's \\"Alligator\\". (Buy it now, really.)  <br /> <br />And I love these guys when they rock, like they do on that album, and which they don't do that much of here. But the Nats do show perhaps a stronger, trickier skill on \\"Boxer:\\" the ability to musically experiment without coming off like a band at war (hi Jeff Tweedy!), the ability to fuse rock and folk without sounding like wusses, the jujitsu to channel a mournful-yet-upbeat sound that somehow brings to mind a 30something everyman. (In songs like the stalkerish \\"Brainy,\\" you're unsure if you should hug lead singer Matt Berninger or issue a restraining order against him.) <br /> <br />\\"Mistaken for Strangers\\" is \\"Boxer\\"'s showiest number. A jangly, dual guitar-driven anthem about being out of touch with your peeps, it manages to be both danceable and a bit depressing, which is part of the band's appeal. <br /> <br />But not surpisingly, it's the slower numbers on this CD that wedge themselves in your brain. Take \\"Ada,\\" a dark, hypnotic trope about a demanding woman, or \\"Slow Show,' a song of wished-for domestic tranquilty that'd make anyone want to hurry home to Berninger. Drums spiral in and out of time signatures, Berningers sleepy-yet-sexy baritone slings ironic lyrics of relationships gone wrong and right, and all seems both right and terribly sad with the world.
0307346609|5.0|Any fan of the zombie genre will fully enjoy this book. It tells an entire story of the world's struggle against a massive zombie horde, through one person's view at a time. It really challenges the reader to look at some of the other issues that would arise from a zombie outbreak, other than hiding out in your attic and eating canned food for years. It's an extremely capturing read, the second time I read it, I read it cover to cover in one sitting. It's a great read in conjuction with the Zombie Survival Guide. <br />I highly recommend this book.

0143038419|4.0|I wanted to read this book because of the premise: an American woman suffers through a bad divorce and decides to take one year off and spend it in Italy, India and Indonesia (Bali). Thinking this was a travelogue, I started reading. It turns out, however, that this is not a travelogue, but rather one woman's search for inner peace with herself, her past and her current life. I didn't have much sympathy for her hardships described at the beginning of the book regarding her broken heart over her husband and her lover, but the book picked up once she hit the road. I enjoyed her voice and her writing style, as it was entertaining and witty, yet thoughtful when it needed to be. The reader can literally see the author change over the course of each journey, partly from within and partly from external forces. Her life in each country differed and so did her attitude. Take the book for what it's worth - an entertaining read.

B000N6TX1I|2.0|Starting off well, I was settling in for a nice, old-school dystopia movie.  Although having some nice characters outlined, the movie really never went anywhere and just got bogged down in recyling violence after awhile.  Most shockingly was the cop-out ending that couldn't even give a face to or a creative explanation for the \\"Human Project\\" or whatever it was called.  Quite disappointed they couldn't even put a mildly stimulating story behind the idea (well, they couldn't even give a reasonable explanation for the TOTAL sterility, that was lame too).

0142437611|4.0|I recently finished reading Martin Amis's EXPERIENCE: A MEMOIR in which he cites Saul Bellow as a literary father figure (moreso, it seems, than his own author father Kingsley Amis). This made me want to read something by Bellow and since SEIZE THE DAY is a short novel (114 pages) from his peak period I chose to read this book first. Cynthia Ozick's introductory essay was not a very helpful introduction to the book. She quotes heavily from the novel, which is a bit of a spoiler. Perhaps it would have been better to read her essay after reading the novel.<br /><br />First published in 1956, the novel is about a middle-aged man in New York City who is separated from his wife (and sons) and living in a residential hotel, the Gloriana, the same hotel where his father keeps a separate apartment. I appreciated this book as a portrait of a middle-aged, middle class white male in mid-twentieth century America. One feels both sympathy for and frustration with the main character, Tommy Wilhelm. He's intelligent and well-meaning, but also weak and easily swayed by others' opinion of him and what he needs to do to become a \\"success.\\" A failed Hollywood actor, he seems startled to learn, like Willie Loman, that personal attractiveness is not always enough to ensure success. His disappointment in himself is echoed by his own father, Dr. Adler, who is unwilling to give him words of encouragement (or the much-needed financial aid his son seeks). But his birth father is not the only father figure in his life to betray or disappoint him. There was also Maurice Venice, the sleazy agent who encouraged Wilhelm to drop out of college to pursue a career in pictures. And then, in the present day of the story (the entire novel unfolds in a single day like the much longer ULYSSES) there is Dr. Tamkin, a dubiously credentialed psychiatrist, who lures Wilhelm to invest in lard in the Chicago commodities market, precipitating the primary crisis of the novel. Against this tortured backdrop is the story of Wilhelm's own efforts to remain a visible and active part in his own sons' lives while trying to initiate a divorce from their mother. While some readers may perceive the depiction of the \\"blood-sucking\\" Margaret as misogynistic, Bellow's depiction of this failed relationship seems authentic, especially for the era he was writing about. Fathers' rights were few and women, even separated and divorced women, were expected to stay at home and take care of their children. And in the end, SEIZE THE DAY is a novel without either untarnished heroes or blameless victims. Even disappointing father figures can speak profound truths, as Dr. Tamkin does when he tells Wilhelm, \\"Don't marry suffering. Some people do. They get married to it, and sleep and eat together, just as husband and wife. If they go with joy they think it's adultery.\\" In SEIZE THE DAY Bellow has given us a powerful meditation on what it means to pursue the soul's deepest desires and to mourn the many deaths and losses even the most optimistic among us is bound to encounter living out the life they've been given.the story of Wilhelm's own efforts to remain a visible and active part in his own sons' lives while trying to initiate a divorce from their mother.

B00005K9LN|2.0|I'm a Judas Priest fan and own many of their albums but British Steel has always bugged me.  The songs are not bad and the album did produce two of their biggest hits in Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight.  But there is no energy to this album as if Judas Priest was just going through the motions of recording.  Absent are the emotions of Stained Class and the power of Hell Bent For Leather and the angst of Screaming For Vengeance. Because of this the songs all blur together with none of them being a standout...making British Steel a very forgettable album.  If you are new to Judas Priest, or are looking to finish your collection, I'd skip British Steel and move on to better efforts by the band like Stained Class, Hell Bent For Leather, Point Of Entry, Screaming For Vengeance, and Painkiller.

The author explores how it can be used as a tool and device to understand cities, computer networks social networks, human-human interactions (speech), human-computer interactions (HCI), computer-computer interactions (protocol), diseases, computer viruses, nature.

140004281X|5.0|Alice Munro's Runaway is a rich and compelling collection. It took me longer to finish this book than I thought it would but I felt I had to stop after each story, absorb it, let it live within me for a few hours before I could go on to the next. It is a remarkable book.  <br /> <br />Three of the stories (three interconnected stories--\\"Chance\\", \\"Soon\\" & \\"Silence\\") I read previously in The New Yorker and thought them wonderful but they are not my favorites of this collection. My favorites are \\"Runaway\\", \\"Passion\\" and \\"Trespasses\\" (which I loved the most of the three).  <br /> <br />\\"Trespasses\\" moved me not only because the situation was odd and sad (a young girl finds out secrets about her parents--that there had been another baby who had died, that she might be adopted) but because that moment of chilhood slipping away and people, who were once trusted and believed unerring, are revealed as fallible, is so familiar to the human existence and yet Munro brings it to us in a new way. And this, at least in my mind, is what Munro does best--shines the light back on the reader. Tells us our own story but in another's words.  <br /> <br />All of these stories have something that makes them special and they all carry the common thread of what it means to be a woman/girl/human being--sometimes knowing, often scared, ultimately alone. The beautiful moments within each of the stories are those moments when Munro illuminates the thoughts of her characters and reveals what it is that makes them each unique, each sublime. Essentially, Munro tells us the secrets of her characters and in doing so she reveals to us our own hidden wants, fears, disgusts and loves.  <br />

I wanted a live CD of the good stuff, not this bowl of warmed over soup.  <br /> <br />Country and crooning...what else do you guys listen to to satisfy your lust for John Denver?

0425173739|4.0|I read this book recently and found it very enjoyable. I picked it up because one, I love Agatha Christie and two, I love Egypt. As I began this book I found that it started out fairly slow. When I start a murder mystery, I look forward to the detective figuring out what went wrong and in Death on the Nile, it took a while for this part of the book to come. The other thing I was slightly dissapointed with was that there was not much information about the scenery of Egypt, which I was expecting. Then again, I guess you can't expect too much scenery from a foreign place in a murder mystery. The shock of who the murderer was in the end, was perfect. It made me think in my mind about how the whole scheme worked out way after I finished reading it. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a thrilling murder mystery, even if they have to wait a little bit for it.
B000NVIGC0|2.0|This is my first Wilco album, and if I'm brave enough, maybe I'll get another someday. Perhaps it was the beautiful minimalist artwork cover that gave me expectations of something else, but I was left hanging in the air. The musicianship of band is high, with lots of talent, giving the listener wonderful guitar tones and tight collaboration between the band members. There are some really nice hooks throughtout the album, but all they do is excite you into waiting for something to happen, and nothing does. It ends up musically being a typical alt pop album played by very good musicians.  <br /> <br />Lyrically, I am not impressed. The lyrics just don't challenge me in any way. They seem to be too obvious, with little depth put into them. Often the lines seem forced, with regards to syllables and music beat. One example is the awkward first line of Impossible Germany, with the word germany spoken so fast, you're not sure what was said. It sticks out like a sore thumb to me.  <br /> <br />Maybe Sky Blue Sky wasn't a good first Wilco album to listen to, or maybe I shouldn't have even looked at the album artwork. Who knows the reasons, but my experience leaves me with a typical bland pop album that has been removed from my collection.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|Dream Theater seems to have been lacking direction a bit in the past few years. \\"Train of Thought\\", while it was a good album, was too one sided, displaying for the most part only the heavy side of the Dream Theater spectrum. To me, Dream Theater is at their best when they can mix things up and have variety in their music, which is the case in all their albums up to and including \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\". \\"Octavarium\\" was an improvement from \\"Train of Thought\\", but still, the band seemed to be wearing their influences on their sleeves a bit too much, but even so, \\"Octavarium\\" was a strong effort with an excellent title track.  <br /> <br />After hearing the pre-released songs \\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\", I was beggining to fear that this was going to be just another post-6 Degrees Dream Theater album, with flashes of brilliance scattered throughout the album, but as a whole not that great of an album. <br /> <br />Maybe it's because I wasn't expecting much and had set my expectations a little too low, but I'm glad to say that my expectations were over exceeded. Luckily, \\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" are the weakest songs on the album. These two tunes definitely have some good moments, such as the good riffs and guitar solo on \\"Constant Motion\\" and the fun instrumental section on the latter. However, the lyrics are quite bad, and the songs themselves are overall not that great. I'm still wondering what the band was thinking when they added that horrible distorted Labrie/Portnoy vocal duet on \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\". <br /> <br />The rest of the album is very good though. The split epic \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" has lived up to its hype. I especially love the instrumental section in the beggining of part 1. \\"Forsaken\\" is a fun track with great riffs and a short but sweet guitar solo. \\"Repentance\\" and its mellow atmosphere came as a surprise considering that previous AA tracks have been heavy. \\"Prophets of War\\" is also another good song with interesting song arrangements. The surprise of the album is \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\". The title and track length gives the impression that the song was going to be some heavy 15 minute shred-fest. Instead it's a very mellow, emotional song with a great instrumental section that doesn't sound forced. <br /> <br />Overall, I think \\"Systematic Chaos\\" is a good album that is undoubtedly the best Dream Theater album since \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\". I expected this album to be a heavy onslought along the lines of \\"Train of Thought\\", but to its benefit, \\"Systematic Chaos\\" has much more variety with a healthy mix of heavy and more mellow parts. Obviously, this album doesn't compare to \\"Images & Words\\", \\"Scenes from a Memory\\", and my favorite album of all time: \\"Awake\\". However, this album is still a very strong offering from one of the best bands to have graced Planet Earth. I highly recommend this album.

Otherwise, it will not play and you shold be buying the 'regular' DVD instead!! <br /> <br />However, and since it was so close to Father's Day... getting the new Toshiba HD-DVD was a no-brainer.  And if you are in the market, I recommend going to e-bay and searching for 'electricgarden2001' as your seller of choice -- unbeatable pricing and fabulous follow-up.

0938045695|4.0|I enjoyed the book, its humor, intentional and unintentional, is engaging and it has a solid information about form, function and routines. Kettlebell training, using the book as a guide, has been a fun and challenging adjunct to weight training. That said, there is far too much chatter, too much pro-kettlebell propaganda (we did already buy the book, do we need to be convinced?), and too many large photographs merely, it seems, to fill enough pages to make it book-length. There is more information in any 5 random pages of [[ASIN:1583332383 New Rules of Lifting: Six Basic Moves for Maximum Muscle]] than in this whole book. Though, not about kettlebell training.  In sum, it's a good place to get some quality information, you just pay a little more than it's worth, pound for pound.  2010 Update: Three years on, it may be that I'm an idiot and Pavel is a genius. Having read the book over and over, each time finding new depths of understanding, I can see how some concepts are so simple as to be misunderstood or missed altogether. It's well done, but one must attend endlessly to the details.  The 2007 criticism remains, though: too many extraneous large photographs, too much chatter.  Lastly, I see now that all the humor is, indeed, intentional. He is a very funny man, this Pavel.
0446530573|3.0|This book is not for the novice.  The recipes in the book are, at their core, sound.  However, one should be cautious when following some of their directions.  Almost all of the recipes require modifications to some degree.  Part of it is commom sense, part is personal taste (that's if you like your chicken to have the consistency of shoe leather; seriously, an hour and a half for baked chicken?).    That said, the recipes themselves are fantastic.  I've happily stuffed my face with Ziti al Forno, Minestra, Eggs in Purgatory, and Zeppole (donuts).
B000NVT0RU|5.0|What is there to say about a film as moving, triumphant, and expertly executed on all accounts as \\"Days of Glory\\"? Its praises have been sung by most reviewers, even earning an Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film. \\"Days of Glory\\" is an Americanized title, but one that still manages to capture the essence of the film. The original Algerian title is Indigenes, a word used to describe the hundreds of thousands of indigenous soldiers from colonial Africa who fought for France in World War II. Clearly \\"Indigenous Soldiers\\" isn't as powerful a title.<br /><br />Although \\"Days of Glory\\" is a sweeping war picture that has been aptly compared to other war dramas like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Glory\\", at heart it is still a character study, focusing on four Muslim soldiers as they maneuver through the rough terrain on the war field, and the somewhat rougher terrain of racial inequality and injustice in their own camp. Prepared to battle for what they call the \\"motherland\\", the North African soldiers who signed up find themselves unsure of how to react to the rampant racism demonstrated by their sergeants.<br /><br />Each character may be a well-known archetype of war movies (the headstrong leader, the humble and uneducated soldier, the mercenary, the lover) but each actor has the skill and the desire to flesh these characters out into completely realistic and believable people. The acting is intense and honest and watching these men throughout their mission is all the more moving as we are able to see real emotions, desires, and fears. These actors have completely invested themselves into the film, and into their characters, earning a special male ensemble award for Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival.<br /><br />In the \\"making of\\" documentary included on the DVD, lead actor (and producer) Jamel Debbouze tells of how director Rachid Bouchareb approached his four main actors not only with the script, but also with the paperwork showing that each of their grandfathers had actually been involved in the war. This may shed some light on the dedication these men showed in telling this important story. A story so important that it led to French President Jacques Chirac restoring the pensions of the empire veterans (whose pensions we learn in the film were frozen in 1959). In the film's touching final moments, as one of the leads walks the streets in anonymity, we begin to fully understand the completely unrewarded sacrifice these men have made for a country that chose not to reward them... until almost 50 years later.<br /><br />Bouchareb has finally brought his dream project to life. After trying to get it produced for over a decade, it is abundantly clear that the final product justifies the wait and the effort on so many levels. \\"Days of Glory\\" is the kind of film that inspires people to accomplish more and to look for the greatness in others.grandfathers had actually been involved in the war.

B000002GWN|5.0|I'm listening to this cd as I type this and I can't help but be grateful that she has helped me in so many ways along the years...her voice is so clear and strong and what a fabulous songwriter and musician. She's taught me to sing loudly and feel deeply and to keep my perspective clear. If you don't have this cd, it's a Must...I feel sorry for anyone who's not familiar with Joni's work...her talent and music is timeless.
B000P2A256|5.0|I didn't start out as a Maroon 5 fan. Bought Songs About Jane a couple of years ago but only listened to it maybe 5 times before relegating it to the CD shelf. <br /> <br />Lately, though, my interest in their music was revived after -- don't laugh! -- Blake Lewis belted This Love on American Idol and did a really good job of it. After that, I dug out my dusty SAJ album and have been hooked ever since. <br /> <br />Many reviews here mention the fact that their follow-up release is markedly different from their debut effort, with understandably mixed reactions. <br /> <br />IMHO, I think they've done an excellent job with IWBSBL, infusing their new songs with a lot more edge in the form of a hybrid pop-rock-dance-electronica sound, complemented by complex melodies and guitar riffs.  <br /> <br />Little Of Your Time ( track #3 ) is a perfect example of this. Normally, I wouldn't listen to such music, but found myself head-banging along to this catchy tune.  <br /> <br />Other instant classics include Makes Me Wonder ( sexy and radio-friendly ), If I Never See Your Face Again ( a rousing start to the terrific album ), and Wake Up Call ( a grand anthem ). The slower ballads also fare well, especially Nothing Lasts Forever and Goodnight Goodnight, though I much prefer the faster tempo-ed pieces. <br /> <br />The guys have really topped themselves this time. Deviating from a tried and tested formula is always risky, but Adam Levine and gang demonstrate a keen ear for what works and have matured beautifully over the years.  <br /> <br />And, may I add, Adam has never looked more gorgeous. :) <br /> <br />Highly recommended whether you're a Maroon 5 fan or a complete newbie. Now if only they'll come to Singapore for a gig already! <br />
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|A unique combination of beautiful jazz piano music played by acclaimed Cuban Bebo Vald&eacute;s with the sensuous hoarse voice of young Gypsy singer El Cigala.  First heard them at a friend's house and could not wait until I purchased the CD for myself and to give to friends.  Great selection and variety of songs.  The nearest to perfect symbiosis I have ever seen in a collaboration between jazz and flamenco.
B000MP0XIW|3.0|All good fun of course, I can't imagine many people that buy this DVD are new to the adventures of The Bionic Man. <br /> <br />The big downer with this season is the poor colour balance and  rendering to digital.

B0007LXPBI|4.0|As with the original version of this movie with Hayley Mills, this is a nice movie despite the premise being so horribly ridiculous.  What nice divorcing parents would separate their twins, each take custody of one and never mention or attempt to see the other for 12 years?  I did thoroughly enjoy Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson in their roles.  There were several differences between this movie and the 1961 version, actually enough to make this enjoyable.  I didn't feel like I was watching different actors play the parts and recite the lines of the same characters from that movie.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|The Scorpions have been doing this for years now, so it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone when they have yet again released another gem.<br /><br />What can you say about this band that hasn't already been said. They are consistent for the most part and true to what they do. They have gotten away somewhat from the heavier stuff over the years, but they continue to write great songs and have done this decade after decade. Yes time  passes bye, and yet here we are still listening to good solid tunes from a fantastic band and that is nothing more than amazing.<br /><br />This is without a doubt their best effort in a number of years as it see's them returning to what I'd like to call their glory days. If you loved the 70's/80's/early 90's Scorpions, you'll be absolutely thrilled with this cd. As I've said earlier on, it's not Blackout heavy, yet it contains amazing guitar work and truly wonderful sounding songs.<br /><br />Pick it up and enjoy it for what it is, great music with a boatload of feel!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|It's a dilemna that must face many an artist: do you repeat what you've done before because it's safe and it's what the fans want or do you do new things everytime but alienating certain people who prefer it when you did a certain sound. In the case of new age artist Enya, she doesn't really do anything new on this record or any of them. There's still her ethereal voice, lush musical arrangements and big choirs but that's what we love about her so why change it? While there's some less-than-amazing tracks, it's still a very solid record. <br /> <br />Less Than a Pearl: Probably one of the best album openers she's done, possibly since the Memory of Trees. Verses are nice and subdued but then probably the most gorgeous chorus she's done hits and it becomes a stellar Enya track. Highly recommended. 10/10 <br /> <br />Amarantine: Not a lot of people are big fans of this one and I can see why. It's not that it's a bad track it just doesn't really have that hook that instantly pulls you in. Of course her vocals are spot-on and the chorus is slightly catchy, it's just not one of the better ones here. 7/10 <br /> <br />It's in the Rain: Originally I didn't like this one but the chorus struck me and I started humming it, especially the backing vocals that answer the last word in the line, so I got into it more. It's one of the more lovelier songs on here. 8/10 <br /> <br />If I Could Be Where You Are: What sells the song completely is Enya's vocals. The music is wonderfully understated, not overpowering her with choir sounds like she usually does. While it's maybe a bit more slower and not as attention grabbing, it's anchored by a great vocal. 8/10 <br /> <br />The River Sings: Very upbeat, very lively despite the fact you don't know what she's singing (several of the songs were done in lyricist Roma Ryan's made-up language of Loxian. A great chorus that slows down the beat a tad; this should've been a single. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Long Long Journey: Another album highlight, largely built around Enya's vocal melodies and the chorus with a kind of marching band drums coming in to liven things up. Best part of the song for me personally is a captivating bridge melody. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Sumiregusa: Originally I didn't like the song but there's this one section where her vocals almost turn cathedral sounding and I ended up liking it again. May not be a song you get into right away but give it time and eventually it'll grow on you. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Someone Said Goodbye: Even though there's a hook with the song, I'm not that big a fan of it. For some reason I couldn't get the chorus \\"adios, goodbye\\" from a Day Without Rain song out of my head when I hear this one. It's a nicely composed track but it may not be a favorite for all. 8/10 <br /> <br />A Moment Lost: The further along the record goes, the more slower the songs seem to get and there isn't that more upbeat song to liven things up. As always, it's a very nice sounding song and none of these are skip-worthy but if you tend to look for specific songs to listen to, some might pass this one. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Drifting: I love the use of the piano on this one. Very minimalist in its arpeggios and chording but fits perfectly with this instrumental. It's very soothing to have on and like a lot of instrumentals, it's not meant to be a big pop number a la River Sings but it's still serene nonetheless. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Amid the Falling Snow: Nice bouncy melody to accompany Enya's multi-tracked vocals. These help the track later with tons of ethereal vocals going on at once. Even though it's buried at the end of the album, it helps bring the cd's pace up. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Water Shows the Hidden Heart: The third, after River and Pearl, to be sung in Roma's Loxian language, it's a more quieter album closer and it's nice to hear her vocals almost cross each other near the end. It's a bit slower and probably won't go in your iPod anytime soon but it's a lovely closer. 8/10 <br /> <br />It's always hard to review an Enya cd. When you use too many adjectives for \\"lovely\\", it might sound kind of biased. It's then you start seeing the songs as a whole rather than just finding everything pretty. While a couple of okay songs drag it down a tad, it's still a worthwhile cd for fans.
B000MGUZM0|1.0|Worst and most useless use of the hurdy gurdy ever.  I love bands that use cool instruments like Dead Can Dance, Loreena McKennitt (both pretty ambient) and Neutral Milk Hotel (more modern, ecclectic). This band seems like they just throw in a bunch of instruments to try and be unique and hip.  I agree with the reviewers that think this is a droning rip off of much better bands.  I can see the references to Joy Division, maybe Echo and the Bunnymen in the inflection/strain of the singers voice.  I'm not a big fan of Modest Mouse or the other pack of whiney bands, although I do like White Stripes and Franz Ferdinand.

1594481938|2.0|Having experienced losing a loved one to depression, I was really looking forward to reading something both humorous and insightful about what drives people to want to end it all...what a disappointment.  None of the characters are the least bit likable with the exception of Maureen, who seems to be the only one who has reason to be sad.  It's totally unplausible that these annoying people would continue to hang out together, regardless of having that one suicidal thought in common.  And the whole angel on the roof and vacation plot points were ridiculous.   I would recommend \\"How to be Good,\\" over this longing for the end of (the book) read anyday.

The series of short stories made me laugh so hard I had to put it down and take a moment.

B000LXHK2C|3.0|I've been a fan of Russell Crowe for long time and I like a lot all his performances I've seen. He is a very talented actor, one of the best of his generation. He is especially good and convincing at playing strong, charismatic, intense, and often brooding characters but I've noticed that I like him the most when he smiles. He does not do it often, on the contrary, his smile is a rare gift but it changes his face completely, it literally lights his face, makes it younger, softer, and even tender. I have always been curious to see him in a light and funny comedy and when I learned that he and Ridley Scott who has directed him to the Oscar in \\"The Gladiator\\" teamed up for a romantic comedy that takes place in the vineyard of sunny Provence, in the south of France, I was very interested in seeing it.<br /><br />I should say that even though I had expected more from the movie, it was nice. The story is very familiar and predictable but the film is a delight to watch since it was made by a master of the stunningly beautiful visuals, the master who can look at the familiar landmark from the different prospective, the way nobody else has. The best about \\"A Good Year\\" is its look - dreamy, enveloping, delightfully intoxicating - just as wine that plays such a big role in the story of Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) who one day suddenly finds himself back in the place where he used to be happy once as a boy but almost forgot the feeling having left for a huge dynamic mega polis where he has become a ruthless arrogant businessman. He will have to slow down and to learn what the real pleasures, values, and priorities in life are. Once more, Russell Crowe has proved that he can act but I found his performance a little too heavy and intense for such a silly light comedy. Watching him in \\"A Good Year\\" reminds me of an old story. A famous comic actor, lying on his deathbed, was asked by a friend, \\"Is it hard, this dying?\\" \\"No,\\" replied the actor. \\"Dying is easy. Comedy is hard.\\" I was glad to see Crowe in the comedy even if not completely successful and there was one absolutely charming and hilarious scene with Crowe driving the smallest and cutest car imaginable which brought to my mind the similar scene in the latest Woody Allen's comedy. I began to wonder what Woody Allen's next project would be. What if two of them, Allen and Crowe will get to work together? That would be a comedy I will never miss.d.\\" I was glad to see Crowe in the comedy even if not completely successful and there was one absolutely charming and hilarious scene with Crowe driving the smallest and cutest car imaginable which brought to my mind the similar scene in the latest Woody Allen's comedy.

B000HA4WTS|5.0|Although the movie may be regarded as a mediocre movie by some, let's face the facts here: Tokyo Drift ain't no Schindler's List. It's an all round fun ride and the Drift sport was well translated into this movie. For sports car fanatics, this may well be in one of your collection as the cars are highlighted in a way that they have their own characters and could very well be the actors of this movie. Not to say that the actors are shabby, though. Although there are no Oscar nominated performances here, the cast have chemistry and are entertaining enough to keep you glued to the story, albeit predictable.<br /><br />As for the disc itself, Tokyo Drift on HD DVD paves the way for future titles to include the U-Control feature as one of a powerful, interactive tool to play with. Tokyo Drift has the Picture in Picture feature, where a 'behind the scenes' featurette plays throughout the movie; Set Pictures; Tech Specs where car characteristics or damage specs pop up during certain scenes; and Storyboards - all at your control. You can bring it up or switch it off whenever you want (only for the PiP. Other features have the option to pop up during certain scenes), without returning to the main menu. Besides the U-Control feature, you also have other staples such as deleted scenes, commentary, etc. There's even a garage mode where you customize (with a limited set of colors and designs) Han's car and actually see it in the \\"Doughnut\\" scene from the movie. Pretty useless, but cool nonetheless.<br /><br />Overall, Tokyo Drift is a fun, fast paced adventure with a predictable storyline (as well as a sweet cameo) and seeing it on HD DVD is a totally new experience. Have a new HD DVD Player and Plasma/LCD? This is what you should play to demo your rig!
0767802659|3.0|I was excited to learn that a movie was being made of \\"Starship Troopers\\", a favorite novel of my teen-years, and even more excited that Paul Verhoeven would be directing it since he had previously taken a much more mediocre story (Robocop) and made an excellent action film out of it. Unfortunately, the movie \\"Starship Troopers\\" does not live up to the promise of the original - highly controversial - novel.<br /><br />Of course, it is hardly unusual to feel let down by film adaptations of favorite books. The screen-writer's need to compress into a couple hours a story that may have involved the satisfied reader for several days guarantees that something will be left out that one really wishes had been left in. Nevertheless, I felt that the screen writing took far too many liberties with Robert A. Heinlein's novel, and the film suffered as a result.<br /><br />As one example, the original novel was full of observations about the responsibility of people to 'serve' society before becoming \\"citizens\\" with the right to vote and participate in the political process - and this aspect became controversial because of Heinlein's emphasis on military service. The movie touches upon this, but quickly simplifies it into a stilted fascist state divided between the non-participating \\"civilians\\" and the military veteran \\"citizens\\". While even that could have made for some interesting plot development, the film proceeds to ignore it completely to focus instead on soldiers in an interstellar war who frequently seem to treat combat more like a football match - even after they have suffered shocking casualties. (A more careful reading of the book, by the way, will find that many forms of service to society other than military were included among the things responsible people could do on their path to citizenship. I am afraid it would take too long to include that here, though, and suggest that anyone interested simply read the book.)<br /><br />Finally, there is the matter of the characters. Heinlein had strong views on the utter pointlessness of racism. He chose to create a future in which racism was so completely extinct that no one at any point in the book ever comments, or even thinks descriptively about other characters in terms of race. But he does leave enough clues in the text so that you know that the central character - Rico - is Filipino, not the white guy (Casper Van Dien) presented in the film. Once again, I find it unfortunate that most of the book's more progressive ideas were erased by the film-makers and more so that having done this, they then fail to develop any storyline around the evidently fascist state they have created.<br /><br />This does not mean the film was a total waste. As a low-brow action picture it is entertaining. But I really think the book furnished material that could have made a far better movie, with greater depth to both the characters and their situation, and I continue to hope that it will be re-made some day into a more faithful adaptation of Heinlein's original novel.e characters.

0395905079|3.0|The publisher's description and reviews neglect to mention that all of the stories in this collection have been abridged. The only reason I didn't give this book fewer stars is because I like the watercolored illustrations (which goes to show that not all changes are bad), and because Paddington is still enjoyable reading, even when edited down. I just wish they had published a color edition of the INTACT stories, or at the very least they should have made it clear upfront that entire chapters have been omitted.
B000002UR7|1.0|Unfortunately this is one of those albums that has only one good song on it - in this case, Creep. I still love that song nearly 15 years after its release, but I've always found the rest of this album completely unbearable. I just can't make myself listen to any of the other songs. Thank god the ipod generation came along so I could copy that one song and forget about the rest of the album.
0895260131|5.0|Great for those naifs who think Islam is a religion of peace.
B0007XH5OY|5.0|While most chose Jim Morrison, my youthful Dionysian fantasies took me to Jeff Beck.  WIth a sound that could slice through steel, a mod haircut framing his slightly surly face, and a thorough immersion into the Yardbirds' blue-based rock, Beck was one tough mothuh, and he wasn't shy about letting us know he could play \\"flash.\\"  His pyrotechnical effects on \\"Truth\\" would be distracting if they weren't so spot on, almost always lifting the song to new, dazzling heights.<br /><br />This new reissue has all the core elements of the original \\"Truth,\\" (and here I diverge from the majority of reviewers), some mostly unnessary alternative versions as well as songs never on the original \\"Truth.\\" If you've ever wanted to an aural definition of the word \\"sell-out\\" then you've got to hear the ridiculously commercial, pandering \\"Love is Blue\\" -Not even JEFF BECK can salvage this syrupy mosh, and one may specualte that record producers were more powerful back then. YOu get three pretty awful tracks at the end of the album, and two good additons, \\"THe Drinking Song,\\" (later popularized by Bette MIdler), and a version of Bolero where the bubbling background guitar contrasts superbly with what today we would call \\"power chords.\\"  It's both more evanescent and straightforward than the original, and worth a couple of dollars extra (though the \\"complete\\" Truth sells at about the same price as the 12-sing original.<br /><br />Face it, though, this album is a classic on the basis of three rock classics, a re-working of the Yardies' \\"Shapes of Things\\" (Bowie does a more pop, but excellent version on \\"Pin-Ups\\"), with Rod Stewart's imaginative pronunciation and Beck's powerfully electric, piercing lead, \\"Morning Dew,\\" an apocalyptic number that applicable to your choice of atom bombs, naplam, or greenhouse gases (Wikipedia will tell you that, indeed, it was a Bomb-inspired song written by Canadian Bonnie Dobson) with its combination of melodic and tempo-dissonant guitar licks as well as Stewart's best singing, and Beck's version of the great Howlin' Wolf's \\"I Ain't Superstitious,\\" a Beck-fest of wa-wa laden special effects that has never been equaled, with a bass run by the uncredited Ron Wood that was quite influential over the years.  These are the standouts, and they're why this album is cherished and being picked up by a new generation.<br /><br />That popularity is NOT because this is the \\"Birth of Metal,\\" as some critics, anxious to sell something that doesn't need selling, will claim. This is the high point of blues-based rock, the glorious, glorified guitar solo (is it only Prince these days who keeps that tradition alive?), an era whose unfortunate macho posing would at least have filtered out such \\"rock\\" groups as Dave Matthews, to name just one.  There's too much blues, and too much note for note perfection to consider this metal.  Besides, \\"Truth\\" includes \\"Greensleeves\\" and \\"Old Man River\\"; the former is a waste of time, and the latter is a showboat (pun intended) for Rod Stewart's intense and generally very effective singing.<br /><br />If you can get past later associations you may have with Stewart (for example, the sickenly Playboy juvenalia of the \\"French girl\\" murmurs on his much later and much worse \\"Tonight's the Night\\") and his smug self-absorption, you can appreciate the raspy voice and confident swagger that make him a rich man's Joe Cocker.  He shows nice restraint during the solos, adding a well-timed exclamation or improv here and there (e,g, \\"Listen!\\") which adds to the spontaneity. His work on Howlin's Wolf's \\"You know you Shook Me\\" and 'Ain't Superstitious\\" are solid performances that appropriately lay out for the Beck's insane guitar.<br /><br />Maybe you need an ego like Beck to play so well for so long.  He states that SUperstitious was stolen from a Howlin Wolf \\"riff\\" (with, we are told, Wolf's explicit permission)--well, really, he pretty much stole the whole song, although it's definitely a Jeff BEck treatment. Heimplores us to play the longs loudly \\"for maximum effect,\\" perhaps while having the \\"Vicar over for tea.\\"  The boy is rude--I I was heard a story about him screaming at an airplane steward for amother screwdriver--it  might even be true), and he rocks like no one else.  I'll take Hendrix as my favorite (and the best) rock guitarist, but flashy, stylish, slashing Jeff Beck is not too far behind.y \\"for maximum effect,\\" perhaps while having the \\"Vicar over for tea.\\"  The boy is rude--I I was heard a story about him screaming at an airplane steward for amother screwdriver--it  might even be true), and he rocks like no one else.

B00005NKKZ|5.0|BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER was my introduction to Simon & Garfunkel, as a young child.  We owned the original vinyl edition, and I am (honestly) surprised that I didn't wear a hole through it!  That's how often I lstened to it.  Quickly, I memorized most of the songs and was constantly singing along to Art Garfunkel's light falsetto, that blended so well with Paul Simon's steadfast, slightly lower voice, in their singing duo.  This album is filled with classic S&G songs that still remain very well known today.  The title song is gorgeous and haunting, \\"El Condor Pasa\\" is their English language take on a traditional Incan melody rich with powerful lyrics,  \\"Cecilia\\" is upbeat and syncopated, \\"The Boxer\\" can still bring tears to my eyes, and the rest of the songs are equally compelling (for different reasons).  There are layers of brilliance, on BRIDGE, in the arrangements, delivery, and melody that carry the body of work with power and grace.  I am sure you will agree and that is why I can't reccomend this masterpiece more.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|GRACELAND was such a great concept, and it made an even better album!  I am so glad that Paul Simon pursued the beautiful idea to meld his songwriting abilities, vocals and distinctive sound with the sounds of other great musicians like Lady Smith Black Mambaza (from South Africa) and Los Lobos (a Mexican-American band, melding Mexican flavor with soul/rock and roll). It sounds terrific.<br /><br />All of the songs are beautiful for different reasons, but I will give you a few good reasons to skip around on your copy of the CD.  \\"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\\" (featuring LadySmith Black Mambaza) is a cross between calypso, rock and South African high life, \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" is straight up, one of the most enjoyable bits of storytelling and Caribbean flavored tunes I have ever heard, \\"Homeless\\" has a killer introduction by Lady Smith, once again, and \\"All Around The World\\" warmly adds Los Lobos into the mix, for a great album closer.  The only sad note is that the music is over way too soon.

B00005Y424|3.0|Not that I had a choice, since I was way too young to see it on Broadway.  I wasn't even born yet, when it had already been on the Broadway stage for seven years.  I have heard a lot of criticism about the film version of A CHORUS LINE, from people who had the opportunity to see it on stage.  I wish I could have had that opportunity, just so I had something to compare it to...but I don't.  For me, it was pretty charming.  The dance numbers were okay, and the singing left something to be desired, but I could tell that they tried to translate it to screen as best they could.  What's more, it was an interesting change of pace to see Michael Douglas cast as the casting director, on the other side of the stage, critiquing the performers.  Yes, it was a little odd, too.  At any rate, the best numbers from the production are featured here: \\"One,\\" \\"Nothing,\\" and \\"What I Did For Love\\" (among others).  This is worth a look.  Would I reccomend you buying it?  Only die hard fans who want it, for the main reason that this is the only filmed version of the musical, that is available to the public.

B000002KNI|5.0|THE CONCERT IN CENTRAL PARK (recorded in 1981) is probably one of the best live albums I have heard.  I originally saw Simon & Garfunkel's reunion concert in Central Park on television.  It was a popular \\"pledge drive\\"  show on PBS, with good reason.  This performance was a reconciiliation for Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, who had a fracas some years before (I think they call it \\"artistic differences\\" in polite conversation), and broke up their duo.  You can feel a really renewed sense of camraderie from these two men.  During the time that they broke up, leading up to their Central Park reunion, Paul Simon had recorded some moderately successful hits as a soloist, and interjects some of his tunes (\\"Kodochrome,\\" as an example) with S&G's greatest hits.<br /><br />Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel sound great here, and sound like they are having a wonderful time playing to an audience that loves them.  They open with \\"Mrs. Robinson,\\" their hit from the soundtrack to THE GRADUATE....\\"coo coo cujoo,\\" to paraphrase the lyrics.  What a brilliant tune and no one sings it with more gusto than the men who made it famous!  \\"Scarborough Fair,\\" \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and many other numbers weave Simon's steadfast melody with Garfunkel's clear harmony. There are times that the two sound like they could have been minstrels, carrying messages of love, longing and rejection to the court of Camelot, and then you hear the rock riff and that vision is scratched!  I think the word I am looking for is \\"timeless.\\"  This album delivers on every level and you will really feel like you were there for an historic reunion between two great vocalists.  It's just a shame that the reunion feeling didn't last.
0736063684|3.0|This book was recommended as a good supplement to anyone starting out or getting certified in the field of personal training. I found it to be eductaional for basic large muscle groups and which are used in a given resistance exercise. But it is lacking in other important areas, like identifying assistor muscle groups, or just a general breakdown of large muscle into their smaller components. Also, kinesiology seems to be completely absent. \\"Anatomy for Strength and Fitness Training\\" by Marc Vella is a much better practical choice for anyone entering upon the fitness field.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I kept reminding myself throughout this movie that the story was about Jane Eyre.  Mr. Stephens made this movie.  He was meant to play leading men and did so with his heart and soul it seemed.  You could feel the pain and anguish he suffered; you could feel the love he had for Jane and see it in his eyes.  This is my favorite version with the beautiful soundtrack, perfect casting and the scenery was wonderful as well.  One reviewer stated that Mr. Stephens was too young for this role, I disagree.  He was perfect.  I'm a new Toby Stephens fan thanks to Jane Eyre!
B00005JPQP|5.0|So of course when I heard Oceans 13 was coming out I had to watch the 2nd installment.  I liked the first but was left with no desire to see the sequel.  So I watched the sequel which was alright, nothing great, but a fun little movie.  But for this movie my expectations were low.  But to my surprise this was a great movie.  Al Pacino is great and fresh as the new villain and everyone else is great.   <br /> <br />Part of my problem with the first one was that the first hour seemed like filler.  The heist was great but nothing else really happened.  In the second one I thought the dialouge was much better and funnier.  But the heist was nothing great.  In Oceans 13 they have taken the great heist from the 1st and the great dialouge of the 2nd.  And yes the 2nd has some cheesy dialouge but that is absent for the most part too. <br /> <br />Overall there isn't much to say.  This is funny, exciting, and it feels fresh.  Opera is the subject of some of the funniest moments in the movie, along with a Mexican workers strike.  Overall this is silly, ridiculous and fun. <br /> <br />Great movie.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Not a loser in the songs on the album. I was especially pleased with the enunciation. I could hear clearly every word they sung and follow along with the written version. This may sound like a strange review, but so many of today's popular singers seem to scream a song, and at the end people say, \\"I could not understand a word.\\"  <br /> <br />The second point is that they conveyed the emotional meaning of the song. Whether I knew the language or not, the message of the song was conveyed. Again, so many singers of popular music today are more concerned with whatever technique/beat/whatever they want to use, they care nothing about the song's message. Consequently their singing is not at all related to the song. <br /> <br />Siempre was utterly enjoyable.  <br />
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|I have been eagerly awaiting a good sniper film for some time now.  I was in the frame of mind that, there have been great films about true tradecraft and methodology as of late (the bourne films are a great example for the most part) and I was hopeing that this revolution toward accurate technique would flow into other sub-catagories such as the \\"sniper\\" film ( I did enjoy \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" but its far from accurate).  I will have to keep waiting I guess.    I will start with this statement.  This movie is one of the best sniper films I've seen.   However, the bar is so low for compairison that its pretty easy to meet this requirement.  Overall, this film was a huge disappointment.  Because I was so disappointed and yet, I read that the book was excellent I immediately picked up the book.   The first 50 pages of the book surpassed this entire film.   To say that the movie is based on the book would be like saying that living in antartica is the same as living in texas because in both places you can find ice.   The book is excellent, and had they followed it this movie would have been spectacular.  Had they followed it...even a little - the movie would still have been spectacular, but they didn't even get the age of the characters right!  They didn't get the set up scenario layed out correctly, they didn't get to Bob Swagger's attitude correctly, all in all - If I was the author I would distance myself from this movie as much as possible.  Read the book, it is excellent, not quite as good as \\"Marine Sniper\\" but then again \\"Marine Sniper\\" is a true story.   Read the book thats all I have left to say.

075640407X|5.0|I was cautiously optimistic when I ordered this book--the reviews were glowing and it seemed a can't miss thing, but we've all been burned before on books with tons of great reviews that turned out to be trash. Fortunately, this is one case where my tastes matched the other readers who recommended it and I enjoyed this book from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Growing up, I was always found with my nose stuck in a book and I would start a new one every other day, but the last few years, there is so much competition for my time and attention I rarely read at the same pace and even short books can take me weeks to finish. This book, however, grabbed me so strongly, I found the time for it and even though it clocks in at a hefty size, I raced through it in a day and half. It was a glorious return to simple joy I  used to always get when I lost myself in a grand adventure and I cannot wait for the next book in the series so I can go there again.

True die-hards knew of 'British Steel', but for the most part, we only knew of the MTV video of \\"Another Thing Comin'\\"<br /><br />Every song on the album is real... searing... 'Priest' (except for the melodical 'Take These Chains') but listen to it with your metal babe, and I think you won't care to much.

0618680004|5.0|The God Delusion is one of the best books I have ready in a long time.  Dawkins writes with such clarity and education, supporting himself with numerous sources and other avenues of knowledge that it is hard to ignore what he has to say, no matter how deep into your religion you are in.  I must admit that I am an Atheist, and thus my beliefs are aligned with the beliefs of this book.  But this in no way adds influence to why I think this is such a great book. <br /> <br />I had previously been reading other books by Christians trying to sway non-believers over to their beliefs, most notably A Case for Christ and Evidence That Demands a Verdict (both of which were given to me to read so that I may be persuaded and not be damned to hell).  A Case for Christ was very well written but was a biased account and the author never interviewed Atheists or non-believers in order to get their point of view.  Evidence That Demands a Verdict basically said that the bible is old, other old books are considered as history, therefore the Bible must be taken as history.  The author then subsequentially makes his claims as history and truth because the bible says it is.  I mention these only to show the contrast of what we have with Dawkins.  He writes a very studied and academic approach, using many sources and referencing them appropriately.  He does pose what Christians and other believers do from his own encounters or interviews/debates and promptly begins to deconstruct them.  We see both sides and are eloquently shown why the Atheistic approach is the more logical and correct choice. <br /> <br />Dawkins' view is very scientific and is based heavily off of Darwin's evolution by natural selection.  Dawkins uses natural selection as the sounding board to everything because it hasn't been disproved and is not likely to be disproved.  In addition to this it shattered the notion that \\"believers\\" and the church had of how and what we are and how we came to be where we are.  In order to debunk Dawkins one must then first debunk natural selection.  Good luck with that. <br /> <br />Dawkins then moves on to deconstruct the bible and everything that it says.  He notes the glairing contradictions in the gospels and how the authors were attempting to make it flow better with the Old Testament and thus try to give it more credence.  For example, Dawkins brings up where Jesus was born.  It is clear that the authors of the Gospels, written well after Jesus had died, were familiar with the Old Testament.  Jesus' birth is written about in, if I remember right, Mark, but it doesn't flow with the Old Testament, which stated that the prophet would be born in Bethlehem.  How are the other Gospel authors going to handle this?  Some say he was born in Bethlehem and moved to Nazareth.  Another one tries to say that Joseph had to go back to his families origin for a census by Caesar.  I won't recount more, but what is important is the lack of congruity with what is said about Jesus found in the Gospels none the less!  Dawkins also speaks about how holidays and rites of passage for other deities of the time were usurped by Christians in order to make it easier to proselytize the gentiles and make it easier for them to accept Christianity as their religion.  One of the most important bits of information that I took that Dawkins used to undermine the mythology of Christianity is the mistranslation of young woman in Hebrew to virgin in Greek, thereby showing that Mary was not meant to be a virgin mother impregnated by God.  Putting this in context drastically undermines the mythology around Christianity and shows it as nothing more than yet another cult religion that just happen to be able to turn mainstream because of the overriding need to believe in something. <br /> <br />Another important point that Dawkins made that I have always wondered is that if God created everything, for everything in a creationist's eyes was created at one point, then who created God?  And again, who created the creator of God?  These types of reasoning, when carried to fruition, do nothing more than regress more and more, never leaving anyone but the theologian with enough of an answer to accept. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that he doesn't seem to address other religions.  He addresses them generally, which does work in a limited sense.  But with the power that he was able to address Christianity, albeit easier since he grew up in this society, and deconstruct its myths and support system I was kind of hoping that he would do the same for other religions, most notably Islam. <br /> <br />There is so much more to The God Delusion, and it is said so much more eloquently that I don't do him justice.  All I can say is whether you are a believer or not, give this book a chance.  Don't simply dismiss it because you are Christian and you have your faith and therefore no reason to read it.  If your faith is as strong as you think than it doesn't matter what you read, your faith will still be there.  Because, I must say, only someone who is willing to rest everything on their faith will be able to finish this book and not agree with Dawkins.  I would recommend to everyone. <br /> <br />5 stars. <br />

When the movie was announced I decided I better go ahead and read it as I'm sure the movie will suck (though I still have hope).

Alan Moore is an amazing writer, I highly recommend Watchmen and all of Moore's other works.

The new Arctic Monkeys CD plays like a concert - the opening is strong and quick to get into the action (which is good as it is also their lead-off single, \\"Brianstorm\\"). The songs transition into each other smoothly but still have enough of a distinct flavor for you to know where you are. There is the chunk of softer fare that begins with the smooth jazz club feel at the end of \\"Balaclava,\\" snakes through \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" (one of the two best songs on the CD), into the softest point \\"Only Ones Who Know,\\" and starts to pick up in \\"Do Me A Favour\\". The penultimate song (\\"Old Yellow Bricks\\" - my personal favorite) feels like it could be a barnburner when done right, and \\"505\\" is a comfortable end. <br /> <br />The music is exactly what Arctic Monkeys started on \\"Whatever People Say...,\\" only with some fine tuning, a little harder here, a little softer there. Whereas \\"Whatever\\" was mid-fast-tempo almost the entire way through, this album is slightly more polarized. The sound can be described as having the pop sensibility of early Beatles, the stomp of the Ramones, and the sardonic bite and wit of modern British lyrics. You'll find yourself bobbing along to even the least catchy of songs. And in plenty of places the music is deceptively complex; this isn't just your three-chord fare though it may sound as much at first listen. <br /> <br />I'd say if you're looking to bounce, or you liked \\"Whatever People Say...,\\" this is something to pick up. You won't be blown away at first listen but you'll certainly be bouncing about, and it WILL grow on you.

B000E33VWW|5.0|Mid 1950s and Truman Capote was a well known writer in high society New York following the success of his novella Breakfast at Tiffany's. After that, as is well documented, a sighting of a small article in the New York times about a sinister, rural murder in a remote Kansas town led to bizzarre, captivating and emotionally tortuous events that created a masterpiece and ultimately broke the writer. This superlative movie tells that story.<br /><br />Capote, a man with a fragile ego and a gregarious desire to be entertaining, and be loved, travels to Kansas with his erstwhile friend Harper Lee (soon to have her own literary success with 'To Kill a Mockingbird). A measure of his vanity occurs in a scene on the train when he pays a porter to effusively praise his work in front of Harper. Initially, the locals are suspicious of this small, reedy voiced celebrity author, who claims to want to write an investigative report on the crime: 'it's from Bergadorf' Capote explains when he sees a policeman staring at his lavish scarf. However he ingratiates himself, first with the head investigator, and then the two murderers themselves - especially Perry Smith, who Capote develops a quasi-erotic bond with and discovers he shares a number of traits with his own background: 'I sometimes feel like we grew up in the same house, he went out the back door, while I went out the front,' Capote explains when asked if he has fallen in love with Perry Smith. Describing Smith as a 'goldmine', Capote arranges for a lawyer to defer their sentence so he can visit the men in jail, getting them to relinquish notebooks and reveal their story, piecemeal, so Capote can write what he forsees will be the book of the decade - a completely new genre, the non-fiction novel. Over the next months Capote divides his time between two completely different sides of America: the dark netherworld of lonely Kansas, where the men languish in a grim jail, and the bright lights of Manhattan, where his readings of early drafts of his book - titled 'In Cold Blood' are greeted with standing ovations from the literati. Capote develops a great bond and affinity with Smith, but knows that to publish his masterpiece, he must be executed. Masterfully, and cynically, like the smiler with the knife, he gets Smith to declare his version of the events of the November 1966 murder, while at the same time denying that the title really is 'In Cold Blood' - a title which neatly encapsulates Capote's dilemma, as well as the killers' motivations. As the film develops, the ego and talent - both genius and monstrous - of Capote is revealed. He dangles the promise of further legal help to Smith so he can continue writing the story, but knows all along that this will be ultimately relinquished. He is so wrapped up in his own issues that he cannot bring himself to congratulate Harper Lee on the launch of Mockingbird, and when he faces the harnessed killers about to be executed, he still sees himself as centre stage: 'I can't imagine what you men must think of me' - 'You haven't been foremost in my mind recently' replies Richard Hickcock, Smith's accomplice. Capote pulls it off - the masterpiece gets written, but the price was paid. As the end credits confirm, he was finished - as a writer, as a man. He never completed another book and died of alcohol related ilnesses in 1984.<br /><br />The supplementary documentary on the DVD reveals Capote to be one of most fascinating American writers of the 20th Century - that rarity, a great artist and a full scale personality. On his deathbed, he declared there is only one TC, there will never be anyone like him again. Indeed. As 'Capote' shows, probably no other writer last century has pushed the limits of morality so far to get what they needed for their art.fts of his book - titled 'In Cold Blood' are greeted with standing ovations from the literati.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not only do the characters mix and blend perfectly, but the acting is superb and the script flawless.  Joss Whedon wins again.  It's one of the few series I watch over and over again and never fail to enjoy.  It's unimaginable to me how the show could ever be cancelled with all the bane and uninteresting \\"TV\\" that now clog our programming.  This was a gem in a sea of plastic.  Glad to have this boxed set along with the Serenity movie.
B000004166|5.0|I am happy to agree that Grumiaux was the best interpreter of Mozart's violin works, assured, fluent, magic flowed from his bow. And I agree that this Philips Duo is a great bargain, packed with great music. I do, however have one little reservation, while the sound quality of the violin is good, I find the sound of the orchestra rather muddy, especially during the louder periods; perhaps this is acceptable when the age of the recording is taken into account. But can you tell the scoring with any confidence? flutes ? oboes ? horns ? ( The sound quality of K 261 and K 373, with the New Philhamonia, is a little better)<br />Even with this reservation, I still give it 5 stars.<br /><br />PS I have recently purchased a new re-release of Grumiaux playing the Beethoven violin concerto, the sound is much better than in these CDs, perhaps a more recent digital remastering of the violin concertos would result in more acceptable sound quality.

B000060OFT|4.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />In my personal opinion, I believe Shakespeare's writing is way too obscure and out there, and when hearing people say \\"Shakespeare wrote for the common people\\", I can only cringe in terror at what plays written for educated people must have sounded like.<br /><br />This movie doesn't change the dialect or dialogue of the movie, and gives it a weird sort of artistic modern setting, which makes it not only a surprising and original twist, but makes it much more watchable to see a timeless tale truly tested with its claim to timelessness. Even if it took place in the year 3010 AD, it'd still be the same.<br /><br />I love the way the adults on the newscasts and police speak, and the way the police officer at the end of the movie scolds the Capulets and Montagues, and the beginning scene, with the Montague nerds biting their thumbs at the Capulets was amusing.<br /><br />Harold Perrineau as Mercutio is spellbinding, and John Leguizamo is equally spectacular in this movie.<br /><br />What keeps this movie from being a great one in my opinion is the two lead characters played abysmally by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. DiCaprio, normally a great actor, sounds like he's just memorized the lines and is reciting them like a schoolchild forced to read them aloud in class--lifeless, with little to no emotion, and an apparent lack of understanding as to what he is saying.<br /><br />Claire Danes is even worse, delivering lines in such an awkward manner as to make me cringe. It sounds literally like a giggling, bubbly school girl reading from a script for the first time while distracted by something else.<br /><br />Another thing which surprisingly irritated me was the SCREAMING. In many scenes, there was mindless screaming at the hands of Juliet's mother and maid, especially that scene where Romeo is at Juliet's window, and the maid calls for her, and Danes (awkwardly) says \\"By and by I come\\", the maid's line is literally a grating, irritating scream: JULIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!  for at the very least, 3-5 seconds long<br /><br />There's a lot more screaming at the maid's hand and Juliet's mother, though thankfully it's limited just to that scene and scarcely any other. But it is SERIOUSLY annoying having her scream like that when Juliet is CLEARLY shouting back \\"By and by I come\\"<br /><br />All in all, the show is all but stolen by John Leguizamo and Harold Perrineau as Tybalt and Mercutio (respectively), while the lead actors are weak in their roles.<br /><br />3.5/5id's line is literally a grating, irritating scream: JULIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!  for at the very least, 3-5 seconds long <br /> <br />There's a lot more screaming at the maid's hand and Juliet's mother, though thankfully it's limited just to that scene and scarcely any other.

It's on a perpetual loop.... and i'm good with it.   Finally someone who knows how to write a lyric and make it pleasant to listen to.  Read all the rest of the reviews if you wanna know what it sounds like...  Yeah, it's the thinking man's Nirvana... yes it's the Radiohead knock-off that will actually get you laid... but more than that (if there is more than that ever)... it's just good music and you find yourself veering off the road saying \\"Damn, this is a good disc!\\".   Enjoy.  And congrats to Built to Spill.
B000002JKA|5.0|I have finally got around to writing a review for this album and after 7 subsequent albums up to the newly released Sytematic Chaos, Awake remains in my opinion their best album.  But its not just a great album compared to their other body of work, it is a all time great metal/prog album that seems to combine just the right amount of heavy riffing, atmospheric keyboards, technical yet melodic guitar solos, and spot on vocals all wrapped up in great comprehensive song writing that keeps the listener involved. <br /> <br />The mood of the album is undeniably dark and La Brie tends to use his growl voice quite a bit but it seems to work so well within the context of the songs.  There are some common musical themes that are interwined throughout varous songs of the album: Erotomania and Silent Man, The Mirror and Space Dyed Vest, yet each song stands quite alone and seems to be somewhat unique from each of the others in the way they are structured and performed.  What impresses me so much about this album is how the individual parts within the songs fit into the song as a whole and flow into one another such as the heavy to quiter passages in voices, the classical solo in Erotomania, the way the Mirror and Lie blend into one another, when the heavier part kicks in Lifting Shadows, etc...it seems the transitions come right at the right time and accelerate the listener into a new and exciting moment. <br /> <br />Now, a DT review cannot be properly done without discussing the musicianship and obviously we all know that the band members are all very skilled on their respective instruments.  But what's more than that on this album is DT still showed restraint and song craft in those days.  Petrucci solos are very thought out and much more interesting than what he performs today.  As well the instrumental passges by the band are more creative and fit better in the songs than current DT offerings.  Lastly, Kevin Moore is a keboard player that is so skilled at creating tensionin a song with his understated layers of atmospheric keyboards unlike Rudess who has butchered this concept since joining DT in favor of continuous solo noodling and corny ragtime breakdowns.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you want to rock out more to a flurry of notes and incesent riffing then modern DT is probably your best bet but if you like the restrained and focused side of DT where songcraft reigns then AWAKE will absolutely blow your mind.  It is pure genius in my book and I still get chills when I listen to it 12 years after it was purchased.
B000E33VWW|1.0|After reading \\"In Cold Blood\\" I decided to watch both of the recent films about Truman Capote, beginning with \\"Infamous\\" and then watching \\"Capote\\". My recommendation to others is to only watch \\"Infamous\\". Although it covers very grim subject matter, this movie is very watchable and enjoyable, as opposed to \\"Capote\\" which is two hours of artsy misery. Toby Jones really becomes Truman Capote in a way that Phillip Hoffman does not even touch. Jones' Truman draws the viewer in and charms, while Hoffman's performance in \\"Capote\\" alienates and repulses to the point that it seems that this actor secretly hates Truman Capote. Also, \\"Infamous\\" does a much better job at explaining the story to thise who have not read the book, and giving depth to the other characters than \\"Capote\\". Watching \\"Infamous\\", the dark parts of the story are thrown into sharper relief by the light and humorous parts, and it cuts precisely to the heart of the matter. Whereas \\"Capote\\" just bludgeons the viewer over the head with gritty green lighting, long staring pauses and unrelieved gloom.

0785123490|5.0|Strano e affascinante, il personaggio di Adam Warlock (nome emblematico: Adamo è il \\"primo uomo\\" mentre il \\"warlock\\" è lo stregone in grado di controllare gli elementi), nato da un'idea di Stal Lee e Jack Kirby nel 1967. Inizialmente noto soltanto come \\"Lui\\" e creato da una fusione di magia e tecnologia, questo uomo dorato, dotato di grande forza e poteri, sfugge al controllo dei suoi artefici che volevano sfruttarlo per fini malvagi. L'universo Marvel ha così un nuovo eroe cosmico, che però non ha alcuna esperienza della vita reale, tanto che finisce per scontrarsi con i Fab Four e Thor. Duramente sconfitto e ferito però egli non muore ma circonda il suo corpo martoriato con un bozzolo mistico nel quale recupera le forze e, come un insetto, ne rinasce in parte mutato, più maturo, per certi versi. <br />L'incontro con l'Alto Evoluzionario è provvidenziale: quest'ultimo gli affida una sublime missione: salvare un mondo dalle forze malefiche e disgregatrici che lo hanno infettato. Assieme a questo compito Adam riceve anche una gemma verde, la Gemma dell'Anima, dotata di un vampirico potere di assorbimento dello spirito degli avversari. <br />In una incredibile riproposizione della figura del Cristo Adam si lascia crocifiggere dai terribili Uomini Bestia, per poi risorgere dopo tre giorni grazie alla gemma incantata e debellare totalmente la minaccia per il neo pianeta perfetto. <br />E' a questo punto che Jim Starlin prende le redini della serie, puntando molto sulla solitudine e le problematiche di Adam, costretto a vivere in simbiosi con un ninnolo tutt'altro che innocuo. <br />Il ciclo di Starlin porta l'eroe dorato, affiancato dal troll Pip e dalla bella e letale Gamora, a scontrarsi con il suo doppione malvagio del futuro, il Magus e a distruggere il sogno di dominio universale del folle titano Thanos. <br />Tra paradossi temporali e inesorabili deità cosmiche Adam è costretto tuttavia a sacrificarsi di nuovo e la sua anima e quella dei suoi amici sembrano trovare finalmente la pace nel paradisiaco mondo spirituale contenuto nella Gemma dell'Anima. <br />Questo nel 1983, ma all'inizio degli anni '90 Starlin opera finalmente il recupero di un personaggio così affascinante. La Morte, supponendo che ci siano molti più viventi che morti, fa risorgere il suo amante nichilista, Thanos, perché con la sua ferocia e violenza riporti in parità la bilancia dell'esistenza. Thanos è però molto più ambizioso e astuto di quanto l'Oscura Signora potesse immaginare: riunisce le sei Gemme dell'Infinito (tempo, spazio, realtà, anima, mente e potere) e le incastona nel suo guanto. Ciò lo rende il nuovo essere onnipotente di questa realtà. <br />Adam, Pip e Gamora avvertono il pericolo che corre l'universo e sfuggono dalla Gemma dell'Anima prendendo il comando di una \\"task force\\" composta dai più potenti eroi della Terra per strappare il potere supremo al folle Thanos. <br />Di primo acchito questa miniserie di sei numeri, con una tremenda minaccia cosmica e le matite del sempre ottimo George Perez (sostituito poi in corsa da un pur notevole Ron Lim) mi hanno fatto pensare a una risposta Marvel alla Crisi sulle Terre Infinite di casa DC, ma lo sviluppo della trama non può che portare a conclusioni molto diverse: la morte degli eroi nell'epopea DC ha un impatto certamente tragico ma ognuno di essi in pratica ha una schiera di giovani emuli ed epigoni pronti ad assumerne le insegne, consentendo alle serie regolari di andare avanti, cosa che non funziona per la Marvel che dunque deve giocare più di riserva. <br />Come si può combattere un potere pressoché supremo? E' questo l'interrogativo che logora le menti degli eroi terrestri e questo è anche il vero punto debole della vicenda: non v'è alcuna possibilità di sopravvivere a una minaccia di tale portata, anche perché Thanos, padrone del tempo, dovrebbe prevedere ogni mossa degli eroi che lo fronteggiano. Starlin, che comunque fa un ottimo lavoro ai testi, con focalizzazioni azzeccate sui veri personaggi, pone rimedio a questa falla come può, in alcuni casi anche con una certa classe, ma in generale la spiegazione non regge fino in fondo. <br />Per il resto la grande battaglia, la sua preparazione e il suo epilogo sono decisamente epiche e riportano in auge alla grande il personaggio di Adam Warlock, uno dei miei preferiti e sicuramente uno dei più affascinanti del lotto \\"cosmico\\" marvelliano.  <br />Se riuscirete a passar sopra a queste fragilità della trama e vi farete rapire dalla tensione di una tragica guerra senza speranza, questa serie non potrà che rapirvi.

B000OMD4BG|5.0|The most tragic thing about losing someone as beautiful and as talented as Elliott Smith is never hearing that soft voice whisper deep introspective words over such lush melodies ever again. So it is obviously a wonderful thing when you hear of new material never before heard...for some. For those of us who have downloaded \\"From a Basement 2\\"...this collection is not so new. Many of the songs on this compilation are included on the aforementioned unreleased B Sides compilation. Though here, on New Moon, the tracks are obviously re mastered and have much better clarity then any bootleg. I will not go through each track 1 by 1 trying to convince you how beautiful and heartwrenching they truly are. You know this. We know this. I never knew Elliott, yet his music always gave me the feeling I did. He was so honest, so true, so real and meant so much to so many people. New Moon does nothing more than solidify Elliott in my heart forever... as if he already wasn't there already.
B000001A3H|4.0|It's a pretty natural inclination to want to categorize and disseminate styles into little boxes.  I mean, hell, would you really want to say that The Beatles and Good Charlotte are in the same category?<br /><br />But let's look at the other side of that same coin--ARE The Beatles and Good Charlotte in the same category?  Is the definition of 'classic rock' versus 'pop punk' really just the distinction of quality versus lame-osity, reinvention and creativity versus cashing in on spiky hair?  Could it really be that the pavers of possibility in rock can really sit in the same cordoned room with the posers with paychecks?<br /><br />Kyuss, believe it or not, makes me think that the possibility is just that.<br /><br />Look at the other reviews and tags that question the category of this band.  Grunge?  Metal?  Stoner rock?<br /><br />Man, let's just call this rock.  Heavy rock, the rock of [[ASIN:B00005JA11 Wine Cooler Blowout]] by J.J. Paradise Players' Club and [[ASIN:B00000K2CD Trance States in Tongues]] by Zen Guerrilla.  Rock that may make you shake your booty some, but definitely gets you in the mood to score.  Rock that lets you bob around the room , throw some hair (if you have any), or just veg out and let whatever it is that's got its claws into your brain have free reign.  From driving rockers like \\"Green Machine\\" to bassy meditations like \\"Mondo Generation,\\" you'll know where Queens of the Stone Age came from and why the brilliant opening of [[ASIN:B00006F83Y Songs for the Deaf]] (\\"You're listening to KLN.  Clone Radio - We play the songs that sound more like everyone else, than anyone else.\\") is such stinging satire, because rock IS a category as broad as the ocean these guys made ripple with their heavy sounds, and this album is a Kyuss classic--a great spot to start, if you're only starting.

B000MNP2KI|3.0|With this film they decided to reboot the whole Bond franchise, which was probably a good idea given how lousy it got under Pierce Brosnan. But then for some reason they replaced all the actors except the actress Judi Dench as \\"M\\", which is slightly confusing. <br /> <br />A lot of friends have told me they liked this film because it got back to the roots of James Bond as being a cold brutal killer. <br /> <br />The James Bond franchise is similar to Batman in the sense that there is a subset of fans who are always complaining that the character isn't dark enough, and needs to return to his dark brooding roots and away from all his cartoonish gadgets. But, like Batman, the character can just as easily get ridiculous in either direction. As in: \\"you know he has a darkside, but you don't know it enough until you see this movie\\". <br /> <br />I don't think Bond's cold side has ever really been neglected. In most of his films it shows up in some form or another.Even in films like \\"The World is not Enough\\" there was that scene where Bond remorselessly shot the woman he had slept with. <br /> <br />\\"Casino Royale\\" boarders on over-emphasizing Bond's psychopathic nature (I'm thinking primarily of the scenes in the beginning). But on the whole I think it walks the line pretty well, and does faithfully reproduce Ian Fleming's classic line: \\"The bitch is dead.\\" <br /> <br />The extended poker scenes also emphasize Bond's cunning side, and give the film a bit of high class Casion glitz. And the action scenes are well done, I'll give this film that. <br />

I am glad they soldiered on, and that 1996's \\"Test for Echo,\\" which has gradually soured on me over the years to the point where it my least favorite Rush album bar none, was not their final studio effort.  <br /> <br />This album features some great songs and sterling production values, especially when compared with their last original studio album \\"Vapor Trails,\\" which was noisy and muddy in its production. This album makes me think of \\"Presto\\" and \\"Roll the Bones\\" in terms of sonic clarity.  <br /> <br />Geddy Lee has never sung an entire album with such passion and soul- there are many vocal lines that end with little flourishes and runs in the r&b tradition. He sounds fantastic. Many people continue to remark about how his voice has mellowed and lowered over the years, but there are still a few moments on this album where he lets it rip (check out the verses on \\"Spindrift\\"), and those tend to be some of my favorite moments. Granted, I loved Geddy's 70s voice and screaming ability. <br /> <br />Alex Lifeson has also returned to form, after taking a backseat on \\"Vapor Trails\\" with minimal solos and more textural playing a la U2's Edge, with some brassy playing, excellent solos, and refreshing instrumentation that harkens back to their late 1970s albums, where he would use different guitars and types of guitars as tools for expression.  <br /> <br />One thing that struck me about this album over my first few listens to it was how much triple time stuff there is throughout the album, lots of 6/8 time and other triple meter material. I have never considered Rush a 6/8 type of band, but this album is full of it. <br /> <br />\\"Far Cry\\" is a great song, a perfectalbum opener, and its conclusion is amazing. To be honest, there is really not a song on here that I can't stand. I would have to say that \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" and \\"Good News First\\" are probably the most unique on the album in the context of Rush, and therefore hold my interest the most.
1932100660|5.0|Unlike the vast majority of diet books, this one is written by a nutrition professor at Cornell University with decades of NIH funded research and hundreds of peer-reviewed journal articles. This book gives you the facts and lets you make up your own mind. It shows you how to minimize the diseases of our affluent society by minimizing animal-based protein and maximizing vegetable-based protein. Read the book and follow its suggestions, as I have.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|I have been a DT fan since first hearing \\"Pull Me Under\\" on the radio back in '92, and have always found much to like in their studio albums upon release. Over the years, some of their albums have held up better than others. If I was not always so impressed with their instrumental prowess, I would probably give this album a 3-star rating for some overly cheesy bits, most notably in the final track (not that DT has never been cheesy before) and some rehashed themes and ideas. But the instrumental moments are still mind-boggling, even if some have been done before (the jangle piano solo thing has been done by Rudess before- I realize that there are only so many sounds a synthesizer can make, but do something different with it).  <br /> <br />There are many wonderful musical moments on the album. Some themes and ideas do sound rehashed, but they are different enough to consider new. I continue to look forward to the ongoing AA saga and await the conclusion on the next album (I assume they will try to conclude it, given that there are three steps left), and enjoy hearing how DT can take a theme (\\"Hello mirror...\\") and vary it from one song to another.  <br /> <br />I did not care for the whole \\"Dark master\\" stuff on the last track. That was the first time while listening to a DT album where I really, strongly felt too old to be listening to it (I've had twinges of that emotion before, but never to this degree), like it was directed at an audience much younger than I (and I am only 30!). But, I do not believe that the abilities of DT lend themselves to a much younger audience- there talent would be spoiled on such an audience, few of whom could appreciate their chops and musical complexities.
0374105235|4.0|This is a must read story of an example of how millions of children are losing their innocence in war-torn regions throughout the world. <br /> <br />I gave this 4 stars because certain transitions are lacking.  For example, how he went from terrified child to killing machine/soldier is not fully explained.  Also, how he finally made it to NY and in the custody of a children's rights advocate was never discussed.  Finally, when I first thought this had been written by a 15 year old who had just escaped this experience, I thought the writing was very good.  But, I was a bit disappointed to find it was written by a 26 year old who had graduated Oberlin College.  There certainly remains a child-like style to the writing and narrative. <br /> <br />Still, I consider this a must read - up there with Three Cups of Tea.  Your teenage children who are about to embark on summer vacations, or just lounging by the pool / beach / lake should also read this to understand how many children around the world are spending their summers... <br /> <br />For the Hollywood perspective, \\"Blood Diamond\\" tells a very similar tale, and Leonardo DiCarprio is surprisingly convincing.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I saw the show last week.  I was so blown away, a couple of times I was brought to tears...What a great tribute to a great band.
0515142247|5.0|Lee Child and especially the Jack Reacher series are the best adventure action filled fictional read out there! I have read all of the Jack Reacher books and I would recommend this for anyone who likes the \\"eye for an eye\\" philosophy. No avoiding conflicts but taking it head on.
B000Q76K24|1.0|I can't review the movie because I couldn't hear it--the Unbox downloads don't include closed captions or subtitles, so if you're hearing impaired Unbox isn't for you! The service certainly works as advertised, but it's still faster for me to drive to the store for a rental (and cheaper too, since we have RedBox kiosks all over the place).
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I must admit that I'm not a James Bond fan really. I mean I liked A View to a kill mainly because Grace Jones was in it. So I approached this Casino Royale with caution. I am an indifferent fan of Daniel Craig so I wasn't rooting for him or wishing for him to fail. All I can say after watching the movie is that it's one of the best Bond films i have ever seen! It's more realistic in a way. There's no \\"oh the world is ready to explode!\\" bs. It's more dark and i think that suits the Bond character well. Forget timothy dalton. forget pierce brosnan and even roger moore. Our new bond is better than ever! <br /> <br />And the extra features were interesting to watch. My only complaint is that they forgot about grace jones when they talked about the strong bond women! They didn't even mention the blondie in A view to a kill and she was sexy C'MON!
B0000931OG|4.0|So many have said that Blur is not the same with Graham Coxon, which is true. But, the remaining members of the band have proven that they can adapt and reinvent their sound-even with the absence of a key member.<br /><br />I enjoy the album from start to finish.
B000HT3Q3M|4.0|Really enjoyed this CD. It is good background music. Particularly enjoyed Al Jarreau  singing to George Benson's \\"Breezing.\\" Some tracks I wasn't as keen on however, overall, a great combination.
B000NRXVOM|1.0|You get what you paid for in this situation- compressed picture and sound, and far inferior quality. Buy the official US releases.
1577314808|4.0|I enjoyed this book however it is written is a detailed way; as though it were a cross between a Psycology text book and an Esoteric book.
1400103789|5.0|I agree with much of what Richard Dawkins says. And he says it so well. It has helped me express my own opinions better, and filled in some gaps in my thoughts. <br />I listed to this book -- the author reads with, along with his wife, who was an actress, so it was a very pleasant way to read it. Because it is something I will want to refer to, I then bought a hard copy.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This is by far one of the best blues cd, album, cassette....yes I am old enough for those...I have never heard a more soulful voice. For as old as he is, his heart and soul have been places he hasn't been yet...He takes the techniques of the greats and transforms them into a CD of all the greats. Budda is awesome!!!

B000NA1OXY|5.0|I became a fan of hers after hearing \\"Girlfriend\\" on the radio. I really like this CD.
B000B5H6WY|5.0|Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar is a window into the psyche of a mentally unstable woman in the 1950s; it shows an interesting point of view of being in a mental institution. There are not many books that are about or have this perspective of a mentally unstable person losing their mind for the first time and going to a mental institution. There aren't many good books about that, at least. I found that this book was incredibly hard to put down, it keeps you on the edge of your seat a lot, I found myself reading for hours without even realizing it. It is written so well and seems like something a lot of people, myself included, can relate to on several different levels. The way she describes what is going on and what is happening to her it almost seems logical. We can see it from her point of view, the way she thinks and goes about doing everything. It is like a window into her brain, the reader can see what is going on inside her head and the logic behind things she does. <br /> One thing that really interested me was the constant referral to a bell jar, like the title, which symbolizes her madness. It is so intriguing the way she describes it as her being inside a bell jar that drops on her, distorting her perception on the world. And then towards the end when it is lifted off of her but still hovers, she knows she is not well but is getting better. It left me wondering what would happen to her next, when the bell jar will fall on her again and what will happen next time it does.

0784011680|5.0|Excellent biographical epic, with inspirational, amazing acting from Robert Downey, Jr., and the rest of the cast.  Charlie Chaplin was truly a genius, and a beautiful human being. Robert Downey, Jr. \\"becomes\\" Chaplin - and the story of his life draws you in so completely, you will find yourself wanting to watch it again and again.  When you hear the beautiful song, \\"Smile,\\" you will always remember who wrote it, and the life of its author, Charlie Chaplin.  Robert Downey does a great job on his own rendition of playing piano and singing Smile both on the soundtrack and his later released cd in 2006.  For any serious movie lover, you must own this one.  Check out the rest of the great cast!
B000002J29|5.0|I had this disk in vinyl, and finally I have decided to have it in CD. <br />Amazing, the sound and the presentation. <br />If you are a Genesis' fan, and specially about the Peter Gabriel's period in Genesis, you should have it. Don't doubt.

0061127760|5.0|With the birth of my daughter right around the corner my wife and I have been doing a lot of thinking about the books we want to read to her.  Now, despite the fact that `Charlottes Web' may not necessarily be a book she'll be read right out of the womb; it was the first book that came to my mind.  The greatest thing about this literary classic is that it's approachable to all ages, boys and girls, and it serves up some of the most memorable scenes in children's literature.  I can still remember reading this book as a class when I was in Grade School and I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />The story, as some have already explained, revolves around Fern, a young girl who is devastated when Wilbur, the runt pig of the litter, is going to be killed.  After pleading with her father to spare him she's again devastated when her father forces her to sell Wilbur to her Uncle only to have him plan to fatten Wilbur up in mind to slaughter him.  But then Charlotte comes up with a plan to save Wilbur's life, and well, the rest is classic!<br /><br />To anyone familiar with the story of Wilbur the pig and the girl who loved him, this edition will be a must have for the family.  Filled with wonderful illustrations that bring this tale to life, this is sure to be a favorite of everyone in the house, the children as well as their parents.  My wife and I are always talking about how we want our daughter to watch cartoons that we can enjoy and read books that we can stand, and let me tell you, I have yet to meet someone who doesn't absolutely love `Charlottes Web'.<br /><br />One wonderful aspect of this book is that it's not just about a pig, for, like a lot of children's book destined to teach morals and goals and principles, `Charlottes Web' succeeds with flying colors to teach children the power of love, acceptance and being yourself.  `Charlottes Web' shows children that they can be anything, do anything if they put their minds to it.  E.B. White hand wrote a masterpiece here, a beautiful piece of children literature that's loved by all and worth every penny.ece here, a beautiful piece of children literature that's loved by all and worth every penny.
B000P2A256|4.0|Will Maroon 5 go down as one of the best bands in musical history?  Probably not.<br /><br />However, the quintet has all the ingredients of what makes a group a bestseller: a distinctive-sounding front man (in the form of lead singer Adam Levine), a skilled blending of musical genres, catchy and danceable lyrics, and the benefit of having an album released when there's no legitimate competition.<br /><br />\\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" is a pretty good follow-up to the group's Grammy-winning predecessor, \\"Songs About Jane,\\" and is likely to generate songs that will receive lots of radio airplay.<br /><br />Highlights include \\"If I Never See Your Face Again,\\" the current hit \\"Makes Me Wonder,\\" \\"Little of Your Time,\\" \\"Wake Up Call,\\" \\"Won't Go Home Without You,\\" the Janis-Ian-sounding \\"Nothing Lasts Forever,\\" Not Falling Apart,\\" \\"Kiwi,\\" and \\"Better That We Break.\\"<br /><br />Even the lesser tracks are still fair and are not to be skipped.<br /><br />Now, if Maroon 5 can produce a third as equally good as their first two releases, they might just be on the way to \\"historical status.\\"
B000026C3T|5.0|Doesn't have ALL the greatest songs (because they wouldn't fit in two CDs), but the selection is very good. Every single song on this album is a classic and has a great remastered sound! I really recommend it for people who want to discover this amazing hard rock band. <br />For completionists, I would recommend these two box sets for a richer LED ZEPPELIN experience: <br />[[ASIN:B000002IQ1 Led Zeppelin]] <br />[[ASIN:B000002IVA Led Zeppelin Box Set, Vol. 2]]
0385340559|5.0|Original storyline, not a repackaged plot-line as I'd read about on other review pages. I received this book in the Saturday morning mail and did not stop reading it until I was finished Sunday. I was prepared to not go to work Monday if I had more to read, it is that good!
B00005V1WO|5.0|This is a really crazy film that may have some historical significance -- I'm not all that certain about the latter. The big thing for me is that it doesn't ever drag -- there's always something interesting going on and the filmscore keeps one a bit on edge too. It's just a crazy, mad film about the weekend that Mary Shelly was inspired to write Frankenstein. I loved it but it's not for everyone, especially the kids! I think that maybe if you liked \\"Slingblade\\" and/or \\"Corn Dog Man\\" that you'll enjoy this movie. Don't expect an epic here.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is the most beautiful footage of wildlife I have ever seen. Growing up watching nature shows, none ever looked this good. You almost feel like your on location. This will make a wonderful gift and increase awareness that this wonderful planet in which we share must be preserved.
B00008NG5V|5.0|A great, laid-back, very mellow CD that can put you right on the beach,with a drink in your hand, watching the waves roll in.... even if you are sitting in your office in front of your computer.  A must have if you love acoustic guitars!  I HIGHLY recommend it!
074356619X|5.0|I saw this book on Ophra's show.  Then, I bought 3 copies and sent to family members.  They all love it.  I listen to it many times, review and review. Great knowledge and I recommend strongly to anyone who has an open mind.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|... I really expected more. This is not a bad album... but to be honest, it sounded a lot like \\"World Needs a Hero\\". No sound innovation, same old guitar riffs, same ol' Mustaine. He is one hell of a songwriter but this time he seemed to be inspired only by CNN News. I really expected more, but \\"United Abominations\\" is no better than \\"The System Has Failed\\". \\"Sleepwalker\\" is one hell of an opener, but I had this sensation of the album kinda \\"sliping away\\" on the next songs. \\"Washington is Next\\" has a catchy tune very much alike to Iron Maiden's \\"Brave New World\\", while \\"Never Walk alone\\" and \\"United Abominations\\" add nothing to the album. The rest of the songs are just forgettable; the only thing, though, that surprised me was the inclusion of the beautiful big mamacita from Italy Cristina Scabbia on \\"Tout Le Monde 2007\\" because we all know how \\"control freak\\" Mustaine is. Overall, this is a low for Mr. Mustaine. We're still expecting that album he's been promising for years. Metallica, where are thou? <br /> <br />
0895260131|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was so informative about the hidden agenda <br />of the muslims. They all believe in the same twisted philosophy which is kill the infidels (non-muslims).  I don't feel that islam is a religion but a cult.  The only way you can survive, according to their teachings is to become a muslim.  Being politically correct will be the deathnell of us all.  I won't stand for it!!!!!
B000777J2S|4.0|Got a bit of Nina Simone going on here and if you are into Nina you're likely going to enjoy this. It's torch music that's a shade or three sadder.  <br /> <br />I bought this on hearing 'You are my sister' on Letterman. Loved that tune, but a whole album of basically the same thing may be a turn off for some folks - it can be a bit tedious.  <br /> <br />It's a love it or hate it sort of thing. Not for everyone, but that might be why it's so special.
015204907X|5.0|I was originally turned on to this book because The Children's Theatre in Minneapolis had a short play based on \\"Where is the Green Sheep?\\"  It is a fabulous book -- very catchy phrasing and cute pictures.  My daughter loves to \\"read\\" it now that she has it memorized.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is definetly an all out effort by the BBC. This series almost puts you there. A televisual feast that should not be missed. Buy two copies, one for the family room and one for the boudoir.Tell your friends.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|In a recent interview for \\"Sky Blue Sky\\", Jeff Tweedy was quoted as saying he and the band felt ready to produce something beautiful this time around. They have produced a graceful, honest, and intimate rendering of some of the best Wilco songs ever.  I was a bit let down with \\"Ghost\\" after \\"YHF\\". I felt that Wilco was trying too hard, introducing distortion and cacophony where it clearly did not belong. But with \\"SBS\\", they are definitely back.  The arrangements are complex and full of subtlety. The lyrics are vulnerable and elegant.  And the guitar solos are the perfect accompaniment to the beginning of summer.  It is perfect in every way.

B000OZ2CZW|3.0|With her previous two albums released over the previous two years, Rihanna was always good for at least one great summer jam that most people have forgotten by the time the leaves began to fall. For the third straight summer, the Barbados native attempts the three-peat of summer anthems but unfortunately Umbrella falls way short of Pon de Replay and SOS. Not surprisingly, the song was rumored to be passed on by artists such as Hilary Duff among others, but the song actually could have been as catchy as her previous hits if it wasn't for that annoying chorus (\\"Umbrella-ella-ella-ella-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh\\"). Seriously, how could no one, from the writer, producer, anyone at the label or Rihanna herself not hear that chorus and think, \\"yeah, that doesn't work.\\" <br /> <br />But even though the highs are not as high as previous outings, Rihanna's latest album, Good Girl Gone Bad is the most solid as a whole that her previous. This is thanks to a diverse range of songs that range smooth R&B (Hate That I Love You with Ne-Yo which is a much better anti-love song than Unfaithful) disco (Don't Stop the Music), rock (Shut Up and Drive), Caribbean (Lemme Get That), and old school R&B with a modern twist (Say It). And with the success of the Tainted Love sampling SOS, Rihanna has dug into the eighties hit to be the basis of a couple songs on this album including Running with the Night on Push Up on Me, Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', and Blue Monday on Shut Up and Drive. <br /> <br />That's not to say there aren't some clunkers, Breakin' Dishes is a Ring the Alarm wannabe but without the siren in the background or even the sound of breaking dishes. Plus you could tell Beyoncé was legitimately pissed, Rihanna sounds like she is singing just another song. Then the three Timbaland tracks, Sell Me Candy, Lemme Get That and Rehab just song like cookie cutter filler. And sadly Rehab isn't even an Amy Winehouse cover instead the rehab in the song is just a cheesy metaphor because \\"you're mydisease.\\" Yawn. But what can you really expect from a song written by Justin Timberlake? If you are asking me if you should download that song then I say, \\"No, no, no.\\"

B000MR9D5E|5.0|There is not much to say that has not been said already. This is a great show about our home planet. The Earth is a beautiful place and deserves such a beautiful series. You do not need a fancy DVD player or HD TV to enjoy this. Also, I am glad this is the original BBC version and not the version shown on the Discovery Channel.
B0001FGBD4|5.0|I rate 5 star for the music, 5 star for sound quality and 4 star for surround mix. I'm not disappoint when listen to this album, each track on this album is very well selected.  <br /> <br />I enjoy even when I listen with red book player. The CD layer also very good when compare to SACD layer. <br /> <br />One of my favorite album.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Rihanna is back with her third album \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" which she co-produced and it's her best and most consistent album yet. Every song here is a winner and this album will definitely bang in the clubs. I was already intrigued early on by it's interesting song titles \\"Breakin' Dishes\\", \\"Shut Up And Drive\\", \\"Sell Me Candy\\", etc. but then I was amazed at how good it was when I downloaded it a few weeks ago. It's just about all me and my boyfriend have been listening to since then. This album is definitely gonna bump in the clubs.<br /><br />Here's a play by play of the album:<br /><br />1. Umbrella feat. Jay-Z<br /><br />We all know it, we've all heard it. Hate it or love it. It's #1 on Billboard, it's a hit.<br /><br />2. Push Up On Me<br /><br />An 80's flavored upbeat club banger with a Rihanna twist.<br /><br />3. Don't Stop The Music<br /><br />Rihanna over a hot techno-pop beat with an ingenious sample of Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\"  \\"ma-ma-say-ma-ma-sa-ma-ma-cu-sa\\". The lyrics remind me of Kylie Minogue but the delivery is all Rihanna. HOT! HOT! HOT! Definitely single worthy.<br /><br />4. Breakin' Dishes<br /><br />Everyone's favorite track on the album so far... Ri Ri is definitely channeling Fergie in this uptempo banger about a woman scorn. If they don't make this catchy-azz song a single I'm writing Jay-Z a letter myself! Also HOT! HOT! HOT!<br /><br />5. Shut Up And Drive<br /><br />The rumored second single from the album. It's a sexy double entendric (yes, I made that word up!), rock-tinged song that I personally love but I'm afraid will not have the same universal appeal \\"Umbrella\\" had. Basically it's more TRL than 106 & Park. But \\"S.O.S.\\" was kinda the same way and look at how huge that turned out to be. Hopefully this gets used for a car commercial or something. I love the chorus:<br /><br />  \\"Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />  Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine.<br /><br />  Can you handle the curves, can you run all the lights.<br /><br />  If you can baby boy, then we can go all night.<br /><br />  Cause it's zero to sixty in three point five<br /><br />  Baby you got the keys...<br /><br />  Now shut up and drive...\\"<br /><br />6. Hate That I Love You featuring Ne-Yo<br /><br />They all laughed and scoffed six months ago when Rihanna was taking voice lessons from Ne-Yo (like all artists don't take them between albums, even she [and you know who she is] has a voice trainer... duh!) But it all paid off on the syruppy sweet duet. A definite easy hit, if this isn't released as a single, at least on the radio I'm personally going to 1755 Broadway to scour the entire building for Jay-Z so that I can mush a rancid chitterling cream pie in his face.<br /><br />7. Say It<br /><br />In the vein of \\"Music Of The Sun\\" and \\"We Ride\\", \\"Say It\\" is another one of those sweet top down ride to the beach summery midtempo jams. Vintage Rihanna.<br /><br />8. Sell Me Candy<br /><br />The first of the Timbaland produced tracks. This song is hotter than Las Vegas in July. It's short, coming in at under three minutes, it definitely make you want more. But thankfully that's why God created the repeat button.<br /><br />9. Lemme Get That feat. Justin Timberlake<br /><br />Not only is this the most single worth song on this album. It's the most singleworthy song out right now. If I don't hear this on the radio in a few weeks don't be surprised if you turn on the news and they report that Jay-Z is suddenly missing.<br /><br />10. Rehab<br /><br />A hot midtempo track written by Justin Timberlake, much in the vein of the midtempo songs on his album. Also produced by Timbaland.<br /><br />11. Question Existing<br /><br />This eerie-sounding, trance-like collaboration with Ne-Yo is the closest thing to a slow song on this album. Rihanna's spoken word part of the song tries a little too hard to be introspective. Think Janet Jackson's \\"Special\\" (\\"water your spiritual garden\\",remenber?) but not as cringe-inducing. Still not a bad song.<br /><br />12. Good Girl Gone Bad<br /><br />It's weird but artists who aren't technically the best vocalists (Janet Jackson, Ashanti, Mary J. Blige) always sound great wnen their voices are layered and Rihanna is no exception. \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\", another collaboration with Ne-Yo, while musically sounding a little too 'Irreplaceable-esque' for comfort still manages to be vintage Rihanna. Vocally think \\"The Last Time\\" meets Ri Ri's \\"ooohs\\" from \\"Dem Haters\\".<br /><br />This is the most consistent R&B/Pop album I've heard on 2007 and definitely Rihanna's best yet. Even the Beyonce-itis phenomenon isn't keeping her down. All of her naysayers and haters are eating their words right now and she's even gaining new fans. I know that by now you have been hearing all the good things being said about \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" and even if you don't like her or \\"Umbrella\\" give it a listen. You may be pleasantly surprised. Ri Ri, you are a hard worker and I knew you could it.not a bad song. <br /> <br />12.

I know that by now you have been hearing all the good things being said about \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" and even if you don't like her or \\"Umbrella\\" give it a listen. You may be pleasantly surprised. Ri Ri, you are a hard worker and I knew you could it.
B000O178BY|5.0|Right up front: I'm completely blown away by the latest Nine Inch Nails album.<br /><br />To be honest I had given up on Trent Reznor ever recapturing the lightning in a bottle that was [[ASIN:B000001Y5Z The Downward Spiral]] - the subsequent NIN releases were an exercise in frustration and diminishing returns. And while the virtual world viral chase that surfaced in advance of the album looked interesting, I just didn't imagine that the album itself would live up to the hype. Holy Jeebus, was I wrong!<br /><br />For one thing, it's got a sound that feels current and classic at the same time. Gone is the hollow, underproduced feel of the tedious [[ASIN:B000929AJQ With Teeth]]. That classic heart-pounding power chord kick that you look for in a NIN album is back, along with noise, noise and more noise. And I don't mean just some noisy rock fuzz; I mean crazy, squelchy machines-imploding-and-running-off-the-rails noisy. And somewhere between the last album and this one Trent recaptured that signature 'funky industrial drummer' vibe that always separated his stuff from just another dude with a guitar and a drum loop.<br /><br />For another it's a full-blown concept album (I know [[ASIN:B00001P4TH The Fragile]] was billed as a concept album as well, but I'm pretty sure only Trent could tell you what the concept was). The setting is the near-future America on the brink of a socio-political sci-fi apocalypse. Sounds like shooting fish in a barrel if you have even a passing familiarity with NIN's favorite themes, I know...but it works. There's plenty of getting on our knees, being on our knees, and getting up off our knees, but in this context of a totalitarian military/religious state, there's a compelling reason for it.<br /><br />Lyrically he manages to examine several different point of view beyond master and servant, and pulls off some very cool new vocal and musical twists along the way without losing the essential NIN of it all. I don't know if it's going to resonate with folks that weren't already predisposed to dig his stuff, but I hope it does because this deserves to be heard.<br /><br />So reaching the end of the disc, I'm already certain that Year Zero is one of my top ten albums for 2007. I'm also realizing I'm gonna lose a lot of free time to chasing the mysteries of this thing online....<br /><br />(reprinted here from my blog, \\"Telephasic Workshop\\")resonate with folks that weren't already predisposed to dig his stuff, but I hope it does because this deserves to be heard. <br /> <br />So reaching the end of the disc, I'm already certain that Year Zero is one of my top ten albums for 2007.

0553582445|4.0|I loved every book in this series and the trilogy before it. Robin Hobb is a great story teller and I'm never disappointed when I pick up one of her books.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I originally bought it because the three singles that came off of it were so good, and I already had their new cd and loved it. At first I wasn't that impressed, but it grew on me. Probably doesn't hurt that I've seen them in concert twice since I bought it, and they played a lot of songs off this at their concerts.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I have been a DT fan since around 1998, and was familiar with Images And Words, Awake, A Change of Seasons, and Falling Into Infinity before Scenes From A Memory came out... So I know the differences in their body of work pretty well. To me all of their albums have something to offer, perhaps some a little more intense than others, but they all have a very unique tinge to them. When Scenes and 6 Degrees came out, I knew DT's career was hitting it's stride. When Train of Thought came out, it was neat to hear them try something slightly different, with more basic-structured songs while still beating you up with those head-shaking \\"how'd they do that?\\" moments... Then came the gorgeous Octavarium which hinted at a much more complex and exciting road ahead... But nothing could have prepared me for Systematic Chaos. <br /> <br />I am stunned at the heart and soul put into this album. It's very fast, very tight, and so well-paced that it's all over before you can even comprehend what just hit you. I must say this has got to be their most powerful statement since Scenes and 6 Degrees... That said, you'll hear past influences of DT albums (most notably the ridiculously awesome time signatures from Scenes From A Memory), along with the typical likes of Pink Floyd, Zappa, Rush, Megadeath, even a little bit of Queen-like vocal layering which fits perfectly... Except on a scale of which only DT can manage to achieve. <br /> <br />The main theme (In The Presence of Enemies, Pt.1) pulls you in quickly and challenges your ears while laying the backdrop for the rest of the album. The slower pieces on this album are equally as entrancing, with unpredictable chord shifts and just the right amount of emotion and ambience. The album climaxes during the unbelievable instrumental on the last track (In The Presence of Enemies, Pt. 2) with such a masterful genius of a sound, you need to hear it to believe it. <br /> <br />This album really does seem to have it all. They're working togetherawesomely, using the same formula they did back in late 1999 and I am very pleased with the result. Even non-prog fans MUST respect the insanity that is Systematic Chaos.
1582406723|5.0|i love zombies. infact, i just wrote a short story about them. <br />and this book is fricken great. i dont think i've read a comic with so much enthusiasm in a long long time. its a bit fast so it kept me on my toes the whole time.  <br />i defenetly recomend it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Fast service.  We owned this and lent it out, big mistake.  Thank you for serving your country by selling to APO/FPO addresses.
1400049628|5.0|this is so great. finaly there is a guide for those who are not capable of staying alive.  <br />this was a great book, even for personal gain.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I had great expectations for this series. Then I received it and kind of understood why it was plugged off by Fox...
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Not sure why some of the reviews are negative for this. Maybe peoples lives have changed since first they discovered Wilco. Who knows... <br /> <br />I for one have been a Wilco fan (not a huge fan, but I do follow the group and buy the albums) and thought this is way better than the last album. I very much like every song on here except one.   <br /> <br />The music is the most inspirational. The guitar work and band have become so much stronger over the years, and this album shows that. Wilco has always done what they want, and this CD shows they are able to relax and let the music flow freely. Every track is a beautiful flow of Jazz, Rock, Contemporary, Pop and Folk.  The \\"chops\\" of the group are so dead on one can really tell these guys have been doing this for awhile. <br /> <br />The one thing I have always liked about Wilco is the way they let the music come to them. There is no sense of urgency (unless the song really \\"call out\\" for it).  <br /> <br />Highlights: <br /> <br />Impossible Germany -- This song is worth the album alone. What a great song.  The guitar work is superb on this. <br /> <br />On and On and ON-- great song also. <br /> <br />Actauly the whole CD is good. Take your time and listen to it....it is def a more \\"chill out\\" CD, and I have loved it since the second time I heard it. <br /> <br />Sometimes I think the Wilco fans expect \\"perfection\\" from the band....I don't get this. There are Wilco albums where I liked only 2-3 songs, and others where I like the whole album. This is one of them..... <br /> <br />Any Wilco fan should own this...a few of these songs remind me of my favorite song of all time from Wilco...Sunken Treasure. <br /> <br />
B000O174CM|4.0|I was waiting with baited breath to see this movie, but left the theater unquenched....what happened????...Eddie Murphy's role was good from what you saw of him, his part could have been expanded (..and I'm not even a fan!) What-ever happened to Leon, who starred in The Temptations???...just askin;.Thought he would have been better suited for the part...but I guess Murphy was a bigger draw.Beyonce's singing was good...as always,But she IS over exposed! but the REAL show stopper was Jennifer...WOW! what vibes.Jammie Fox was not strong enough and did nothing for his role.Perhaps Denzel could have flipped this movie into a powerhouse..... probably wanted too much money. I could see Morgan Freeman in the part of Danny Glover...Much more humility and prescence!...The songs were great, and the costumes were just right for that era. we should be thanking Berry Gordy and Diana Ross for this privalege.....   Sandee
B000ESSTKG|5.0|When initially released a couple of decades ago, I found MFTM being a rather bleak album.  Even the singles were somewhat low-key arrangements of what I still thought were great tunes.  The reason I bought this re-mastered version is that I have been enjoying other re-mastered DM releases and thought that maybe it was worth giving MFTM another try. <br /> <br />Hearing this album again proves that giving it a second chance was well worth my time.  The sound of many bands from the 80s has aged poorly; one can often almost pin point which year such and such album was released given the production sound that was currently in vogue.  MFTM has, however, a timeless production.  This could actually be released today and by tagging another artist name to the music this could most certainly appeal to today's masses.  The songs are built upon minimalist sound bites and layered with various sound effects.  This may have sounded bleak in the mid 80s but today this sounds remarkably fresh. <br /> <br />Listening to the album in 5.1 surround sound gives even more value to the production.  The low-key beats driving the songs flow in a perfect tandem with the instruments flowing all around the listener.  Actually, I hardly bother listening to this any other way. <br /> <br />Also included is a very interesting documentary about the making of the album, the making of its cover and the subsequent promotional tour.  A highlight is the final concert which certainly put them on the map in the US.  One senses how much pride DM still feel of MFTM. <br /> <br />I have one final note.  Having bought other DM re-releases from the US, I initially simply forgot that the CD version from the UK is a hybrid SACD.  I thus listened first to the dts surround sound the first few times, and was impressed.  Yet once I put the SACD it felt like the sound improved almost half way to the difference of re-mastered versions of other CDs today from initial pressing 20 years or so ago.  The difference is subtle but definitely audible.  This should not be happening today.  I intend to buy the more expensive DM re-releases from the UK and dump the US versions.   <br />
020530902X|4.0|This little book should be on the desk of anyone whose profession requires him or her to communicate via the written word.<br /><br />My only gripe (and it's why I give it four stars instead of five) is the book's use of writing examples that are stylistically archaic and often contradict the authors' basic rules.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I don't understand the criticisms of this album. Wings For Marie (which is a 17 minute epic) is great. Whoever called Wings For Marie filler is insane. It was what initially struck me as the best thing on the album. Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)/Rosetta Stoned and Intension essentially succeed in their intentions. Intension has the same kind of beauty as Disposition from the Lateralus album, yet it's not quite as subtle. Lipan Conjuring and Viginti Tres are the same kind of intermissions that are on most Tool albums, it's nothing new at all. That just leaves you with the more directly accessible songs: Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot and Right In Two. This album had to grow on me. I had to listen to it a bunch of times before I really started \\"getting\\" it. It's a grower. At approximately 76 minutes long, it may be a lot to take in. With time, though, you'll see that it's at once complex and listenable. The meaning of this album isn't clear, but it's a hell of an experience. The packaging is simply awesome, as with previous Tool albums. I now consider this one of the best Tool albums along with Ænima and I recommend it.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This show is, as always, a total blast to watch.  It's witty, it's intelligent, it's addictive.  Veronica Mars is, as always, sarcastic in the extreme, cartoonish, and wonderful.  Her dad is the best dad on television.  Logan is the most hopelessly in love ex-boyfriend ever, and Wallace is an amazingly dedicated friend. <br /> <br />It's an excellent show about people with both great senses of humor and an abundance of moral fiber - this show rocks!!!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble's latest CD is fantastic!  His voice takes you in a world of heart-felt dreams!  One of his best collections so far ...
B000MXPE74|5.0|none of the songs make sense. it's loud. it's fast. IT'S BRILLIANCE BEYOND BELIEF. Get this cd. That's all I can say. It can't be described in words. All I can say is.... you'll wanna strip and dance naked around your house. It's that good. Seriously.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Seriously, I've seen this movie, oohhhhh, approximately ten times, and I enjoy it more and more each time.<br /><br />I have no idea how the Coen brothers do it, but they manage to create characters that fit their cast, which, of course, makes for a perfectly cast movie. Every time. Especially in The Big Lebowski. And the dialogue! This isn't the only Coen movie that people vapidly quote, but there are more memorable/quotable lines in this one film than all the rest put together; and that's saying a lot, when you look at their film discography.<br /><br />So if you haven't seen it, see it.<br /><br />If you're not going to watch it, no matter what, then so be it. The dude abides.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|Arctic Monkeys have been my favorite band for a long time. No matter what I hear from them, I automatically fall in love with it. They're sheer genius and so much more. But I have to admit... even I was afraid to hear this album, because it's a bit different. But after having it on repeat for so long, I can't imagine them NOT releasing this brilliant piece of work. They're back and just as amazing as ever. God bless the Arctic Monkeys. sigh.... I LOVE THEM. genius. GENIUS.
B000000XCA|5.0|First album from CCR.  Good ole Rock & Roll  Bayou Style!!!
B000001FYL|5.0|I never thought I'd be able to find this CD but Amazon had it and it was shipped very fast.  Great album. Just a great album with great songs from the movie which was a clasic western.
B000059LGC|5.0|An engrossing story, played out by an excellent cast.  Location and scenery are a big plus.  I love this movie.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|You can read the product specs to know all the tech and material details.  However, I cannot express enough that this is the best title for the dollar to display your home theater HD setup.  The picture quality is absolutely phenomenal.  There are scenes, in this series, that force me to wonder if it could look any better to the naked eye?  It's already an astounding series for its material. So to have it in Hi-Def, also, is worth every penny.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Sergio Leone made his indelible mark with the three Clint Eastwood films, but this is his best work, even though Clint is absent. Not to worry. \\"Once Upon A Time\\" features a wonderful all-star cast. Avoiding the overdone goodguys vs bad guys cliche, Leone casts perpetual goodguy Henry Fonda as one of the sleaziest amoral villains you'll ever see. And Fonda doesn't disappoint in the role. The so-called goodguys are actually not so good, but they're played brilliantly by Jason Robards and Charles Bronson. Claudia Cardinale is striking as the libertine. Even the opening scene focuses on Jack Elam and Woody Strode - two of the best character actors to appear in any Western.<br /><br />The plot meanders through a number of twists and subplots, requiring the viewer to follow all of the action between gunfights. Leone challenges the conventional concepts of loyalty, friendship, and alliances. Highly recommended.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is by far my favorite show on television these days. In fact, it's the only one that I watch on a regular basis. Supernatural is one of the best horror shows ever. The second season offered some great surprises and a nice expansion on the overall mythology. I'm not going to talk anymore about this seasons strengths ( all the rest of these reviews have that covered )instead I'm going to focus on some of the faults. This season did have some flaws. First of all, there were some very dull episodes. Especially around the middle of the year. The episode with the clowns was mishandled and the one with the dolls was definetely \\"been there, done that\\". Which brings me to my only real big gripe with the show. The plots are mostly taken from other shows/movies. I've seen similar things in stuff like The X-Files, Night Gallery, and the Phantasm series. In fact, watch Phanatsm 2 sometime and tell me that there isn't a little bit of a comparison? Sometimes this show just feels derarative of other things. My biggest complaint of season two is the Episode Heart. I was waiting for them to bring out werewolves and I figured that this would make for an awesome episode. The episode was good. There was some terrific emotion and dialogue. The werewolves however....were without a doubt the LAMEST looking things I have ever seen. They were just people with teeth and fangs! Hello! They are supposed to be wolves. I've seen better in those crappy Howling sequals. I know that the show's budget is low, but common. It made a otherwise good episode kind of stupid. Speaking of the budget, I have to say enough with the spirits already. I want more monsters. If other shows can do it, then so can Supernatural. Now don't get me wrong, I love this show and the good things more than out way the bad. I just thought that with all of the gushing going on with these reviews, that I should point out that even this show isn't perfect. At any rate, I can't wait for season three. Bring it on guys!
0393316041|5.0|This \\"autobiography\\" is as unconventional as Feynman himself. It follows a zig-zaggy chronology through Feynman's life from childhood to young adulthood in a series of brief accounts that showcase his impish humor, profound intellect, and disdain for arrogant authority. No doubt, it was his nonconformist nature that led him to pursue science in a way that led to his breakthroughs in physics and, eventually, to the Nobel Prize.<br /><br />But this book isn't aimed at scientists. It's an entertaining biography for a general audience interested in meeting an unforgettable character. You'll find yourself smiling while you read of Feynman's adventures and gaffes. Even if you hated your high school physics class, you'll enjoy learning about Richard Feynman, a free spirit living in a time of social stuffiness and conformity.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Ive never really was into country music, but last week Ive bought 2 Cash CD's . One of them,  the American V , is an instant pleasure, no need to adjust. Its WARM, acoustic, filling, emotional, calm. Great CD!
0312263120|1.0|Digital Fortress is a really cheesy and unrealistic book. The author says he wrote this book because he studied cryptography and computer science. This book shows he knows nothing about computers. For example it refers to the main character sending a tracer by sending it to an email account to see who owns the email account. This makes no sense at all because a tracer sent through an email would just tell them what port the server is on and it's I.P. address not the person's last name, first name and address. Also people access email servers they don't actually receive the email directly. The server stores the email until the person accesses it and it does actually show any identifying information if traced. Also the computers at the NSA are described in this book as having a command line system in one chapter but later it says that a little flashing icon appeared to tell them they have mail. Real computers used at government agencies probably don't have AOL and would be a command line system especially if they are being used as a server. When the people use the computers as a command line in this book they tell the computer what to do in plain English then call it LIMBO programming for example the people type in send tracer and open mail and it does it. LIMBO is not used for operating systems it is used to compile programs and is an application for Inferno, which is an operating system based off of Unix. The book is also full of plot twists which have been done so many times before. For example when their secret government files are going to be opened by the public and if they guess the password to magically stop the people wrong one more time they can never guess again they figure it out because with less than 1 second remaining on the timer. Of course with all these cheesy plot you have to come to the cheesy characters. The main character Susan is described as perfect and smart. Her husband is described as perfect smart and dedicated to the United States. The commander is also described as perfect smart, calm in any situation, and he is willing to sacrifice himself for the country. The villains are pure evil too who die in the end. See a trend in the characters? In conclusion I didn't like this book. Only read it if the predictable story and the endless cliches don't annoy you. Especially don't read this if you want to learn about computers or cryptography.  This was Dan Brown's first book and it shows.       <br />   <br />
078322740X|5.0|This movie is one of Goldies best and Steve Martin does great as the straight guy.....a real keeper.
0140274235|1.0|The first book I read by E.M.Forster. Long descriptons, not much going on, it simply bored me to the point that I never finished it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|With a twisting and complicated plot, North and South gives us an excellent look at the industrial north in Victorian England.  It is an intricate web of lives that depend on rough trade and manufactoring in a time when gentle manners and moral standing were vital in society.  The setting is as dark and brooding as Richard Armitage's John Thornton, who is a close contender for the next Mr Darcy.  The tension between him and Margaret Hale is tight with intellect and sexuality while giving us passionate social comment on the strain of such a suppressive culture.  It is a faithful rendition of the novel.
0393316041|5.0|This autobiographical work is one of the most delightful discussions of a brilliant nuclear physicist you will ever read.  The book covers some of the most serious subjects of the 20th century, with humor that will amaze you.  In narrating his adventures, Feynman shows physicists to be human beings, with faults and foibles, and presents reasons why they pursue such esoteric careers.  Anyone who is aware of the history of the development of the atomic bomb, and the U.S Space Program, will both enjoy and learn from this book.  Once you read it, you will be recommending it to all your friends.
1400079179|5.0|There may not be many of us out there who read the book before we see the movie, but if you can this is one book I whould do in that order. It is fiction, but there's that sliver of a chance that it is non-fiction. I don't think it happened that way, but it makes for a great story and also, I believe reaffirms your faith.<br /><br />After all, if you can't challange your faith, then what good is it. If you can keep an open mind and still come back to what you have believing in it all the more because of that experience, then you are most definately better off than someone who blindly believes in it.<br /><br />And along the way you have this amazing theory by Dan Brown regarding what may or may not have happened to Jesus before or after he died on the cross. After all, how many years of Jesus's life are missing from the bible. He's like 12 and then we don't see him again until he's like 30. A lot could have happened before his path down the road to resurrection.<br /><br />I would also recommend Holy Blood, Holy Grail. I 'm reading that one right now and believe that if you read it first before Da Vinci, then you won't be as affected by the storyline. If you read it later, then it fills in any missing gaps and basically explains or backs up the plot lines/theories that Dan Brown uses in this book.
B000002UAC|5.0|Though I am pleased with the CD, I mistakenly thought I was buying \\"Meet The Beatles\\". The covers look identical to the orginal LP, which apparently is not available in a CD.
B0009H1CK6|5.0|I purchased this item as a Mothers Day gift. Mom did her club thing back in the seventies and early eighties. She still spins this DVD every now and again and again. I enjoy it also, though I would prefer to be there.
B000M7XSGE|5.0|That honour has to go to \\"Time\\" in my opinion but still this album is very strong on its own merits. For one thing, this has been remastered by Jeff Lynne himself with 3 extra tracks and liner notes also written by Jeff plus the lyrics as well. I actually hate \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" but \\"Last Train To London\\" is one of my all-time favourite tracks. By the way, \\"Diary of Horace Wimp\\" isn't as bad as all that and it has some interesting musical ideas and was always meant to be a kind of musical joke so don't take it so seriously. All the other tracks are good working examples of good songwriting and melody irrespective of genre and even disco, done tastefully is good music.<br /><br />Now we get in this version a mini-lp replica sleeve gatefold design which is rather well done as well.  All the lyrics in both English and Japanese are included as well as a mini poster of the band as well. The sound quality isn't an improvement over the 2001 re-release and this is essentially the same package sound quality-wise as this release except for the mlps design and so if you already have the 2001 remastered version and if you are not an mlps fan, then I see little point in getting this.  If, however, you don't have the earlier remastered version, then this represents a good upgrade.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000H305U0|2.0|Boring is the only way to describe this over produced and over hyped album.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This is a great movie.  There are a few parts (the opening scene for one) that I would have expected my kids to be afraid, but they weren't.  They may be too young to actually understand what was happening.  My kids are 2 and 4.  My 2 years old LOVES Babe.  We've watched this movie a few tiimes now and its enjoyable for the whole family each time.  We haven't gotten bored with it yet.
1577312082|5.0|In my opinion - the content of this audio book is very enlightening.  SInce I am on the spiritual path of learning how to live \\"in the moment\\" I truly enjoyed the various topics and means of achieving that presented therein.  I listended to it on my commute to and from wortk and now my boyfriend is listening to it!  It is contageous!!!  It also helps alleviate road rage HA HA!
B00011F5DK|4.0|We have had a lot of fun with this toy, so far.  Thanks, Karen
B000MGUZM0|4.0|I was fully prepared to give this album 5 stars.  I really was.  I really liked the variety - the foot-stomping rhythm of \\"Keep The Car Running\\", the sad & haunting \\"Ocean Of Noise\\", the way \\"Bad Vibrations/Black Wave\\" and \\"The Well & The Lighthouse\\" each shift gears midway through.  I definitely liked where the album was going.  And then WHAM!  Arcade Fire tacked \\"No Cars Go\\" (a crummy, excessively-layered dud reminiscent of the Thompson Twins) and \\"My Body Is A Cage\\" (just an overall snoozer) onto the backend of this record and I couldn't help but feel disappointed.  Overall, this is a nice move up from Funeral, however I can't help but feel like maybe the band should've quit while they were ahead...or else adjusted the track list.  Still worthy of 4 stars on the strength of the other songs.
0307275639|2.0|While I seem terminally \\"unhip\\" occasionally I do decide to slide back into a 21st Century experience. As it seems everyone and their grandmother has read Tuesdays With Morrie I thought, \\"Why not?\\" The book is terribly hokey and I must express my confusion at everyone who raved about this but accuse The Secret of being nothing more than a book of quotes. After all, Tuesdays is really nothing more than a rather brief biography and... quotes.<br /><br />Morris Schwartz was a soc press diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and Mitch Albom was a studen of his who comes back to spend time with Morrie during his final months. It's a book about dying, coping with death, and a pinch and a dash of everything else: family, relationships, money, work, etc. It certainly has its good point but it really is nothing more than a spoonful of common sense: slow down, smell the roses, be nice to other people.<br /><br />Two cringe worthy parts of the book, for me, involved having children and getting married. I don't want children and I'm undecided about marriage. And I completely agree that having children and getting married create huge changes in a person's life but so does not doing those things. Also, the implication that only family will be there for you in a situation like Morrie's seems a bit daft as Mitch - a friend - is recording all of this.<br /><br />Can't say I would have missed much if I had skipped this.
B000002UAF|5.0|Though my favorite Beatle era has long been their middle period (RS through MMT), with their later period (1968 to the end) coming in second place, I've been getting reacquainted with this wonderful earlier album in a major way lately.  Their early period might not be as polished, sophisticated, deep, or mature as their middle or later periods, but the songs on this album are all absolutely incredible.  There's not a single filler song; all of them are loaded with energy, great hooks, wonderful instrumentation, and some suprisingly mature and introspective lyrics for being only their third album.  The songs may all be about love, but each one is special and unique, dealing with different types and aspects of love.  These aren't the typical simplistic love pop songs of 1964.  It's also a landmark album in that it was their first to consist entirely of original material.<br /><br />It's amazing to rediscover just how great the early Beatles were, how much kick their music had to it, making up with pure pop/rock energy what it lacked for in terms of maturity and sophistication.  It's also probably true that this album is the most accurate picture of what Beatlemania was like, while the phenomenon was still new and exciting, before they had grown weary and cynical of touring and having to keep up a happy squeaky-clean public image.  The guys singing these songs were still cute happy-go-lucky moptops.  And though only the first 7 songs were included in the film, the other 6 are nothing to sneeze at.  More bands should have such high-quality leftovers.  (Although, surprisingly, this is one of the few albums where Ringo doesn't get any songs.)<br /><br />The songs range from energetic pop, such as the opening title track (the opening chord still has an amazing effect so many decades later), \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" and \\"Tell Me Why,\\" to soft romantic ballads, such as \\"And I Love Her\\" (which contains some of Paul's finest lyrics, and I'm usually no longer a fan of the schmaltzy songs he often sang!) and \\"If I Fell\\" (which has some beautiful harmonising), to songs with a more complex (for a pop song) view on love and relationships, such as \\"You Can't Do That\\" (about a jealous and insecure lover) and \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" (an angry and depressed lover who got burned and wants revenge).  The final track, \\"I'll Be Back,\\" has also long been one of my favoritest Beatles' songs; it's so poignant and beautiful, the type of song that anyone who's had one's heart broken but still wants another chance to have a relationship with that person can relate to.  And since John is my favorite Beatle, it certainly doesn't hurt my opinion of this album that he sings 9 of the 13 songs.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great slice of pop paradise and Beatlemania, proving that there actually were some truly great albums made in 1964.  This is far from the typical album of the era, with just a few great songs padded out by a bunch of filler.  Every single track is a winner, with never a dull moment.sang!) and \\"If I Fell\\" (which has some beautiful harmonising), to songs with a more complex (for a pop song) view on love and relationships, such as \\"You Can't Do That\\" (about a jealous and insecure lover) and \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" (an angry and depressed lover who got burned and wants revenge).

B000OCXFCO|5.0|Frank Bello was right when he told Mustaine should get angry again to bring us his great music back. United Abominations is Megadeth at its best. The System has failed was the appetizer for this great album. Inteligent lyrics that put all CNN and BBC bring to us every day at stake together with Mustaine ripping music. Long Live Dave Mustaine ! Long Live Megadeth !!!
B0002W4SWC|5.0|You don't have to be into chick flicks to appreciate this movie. I personally am not into the serious romance movies. This one made me laugh, tugged at my heart strings, and made me sigh. I believe this is one of Renee Zellweger's best performances. I never had a crush on Colin Firth until I saw this movie. His performance was outstanding along side with Hugh Grant's whose wit had me in stiches. The sequel was also a fabulous movie that I have yet to purchase. I also like the deleted scenes and take outs at the main menu. A DVD you must add to your collection. You will never tire of seeing it.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Feeling that the SATC episodes airing on my local KTLA station were overly sanitized, I bought this set to give me the whole shebang (I did the same by buying the entire 'Six Feet Under' series on DVD after seeing a few edited episodes on Bravo). I am very happy with the results. I shall nor comment on the show or its plotline(s); that is for someone else to do. As for the comprehensive series archive, this is wonderful. The collection is compact (a 1.5\\" wide by 11.5\\" tall lucite slipcase houses an upholstered pink binder housing all the DVDs in cardboard slotted holders. Much easier to find space for than the cutsie 'Six Feet Under' big-block series set. Brief episode descriptions are included.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|He he. I get a giggle out of these guys and their obvious obsession/love for seventies era hard rock. What do they sound like? Take some Uriah Heep, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Budgie, mix liberally with some Blue Cheer, Ozzy era Black Sabbath, add a tiny bit of the Who and the sonic sensibilities of The White Stripes and voila! Nothing new to hear here folks, but even so Wolfmother manage to sound more than a pastiche of the great '70s era bands they emulate. While it's true that some of the lyrics reflect the most cringeworthy of hard rock stereotypes, for the most part they've successfully revived a style of music. A style that is almost completely missing from today's sonic landscape and most importantly they rock! (albeit sometimes with tongue firmly planted in cheek)

B000002U8G|4.0|Heard this as a young man when it was new, and having heard the previous recordings from the 60's, knew this was a departure. \\"Echoes\\" filled one side of the vinyl album and it was instantly a signature song for youthful psychedelic experiences. I now look back and find \\"Fearless\\" my fav Floyd song but that the overall feel is a precursor for just about everything they produced afterward, especially the \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\". If you like all things Pink Floyd, you should have this. It is sooo different from their first 4 albums though. Most early fans would say Roger Waters took them into the large mainstream market for rock in the day. A tragedy ?  Hardly.
B000000OTY|5.0|Peter Gabriel is the best!  I have not heard all of his work, but I always find something new to appreciate every time I hear one of his songs.  Like being at a live concert.  His lyrics are so visual.
0156027321|5.0|The book tells a remarkable story of survival at sea, under most unusual circumstances - one lifeboat containing a boy and some zoo animals that were to be transported overseas.  The storytelling is vivid and gripping - I felt that I was with them on that lifeboat.  The descriptions of the behaviors of the animals rang true, including some brutal predator-prey scenes.  The way Pi evolved to meet the challenes that he faced, the way he reacted to events, the way he thought about them, also rang true.   <br /> <br />But some plot twists at the end can really leave you thinking, wondering, what really happened on that lifeboat?  I actually read this book twice.  The first time I read it a couple of years ago, once I got to the end, I felt really disappointed - those who have read the book will understand what I mean.  Yet I was overall very impressed with the book, especially the survival story, so much so that I recommended it to my book club and reread the book.  The discussions were great.  We realized that this book was more than the story that it told, it was also like a big puzzle to be solved (even more so than the ending at first suggests), and we as a group came to an understanding of the story that none of us had reached independently.   <br /> <br />So, I recommend this book highly, and especially recommend it for a book club.  But don't bother with the book club questions at the end of the book.  You'll know what to ask!
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Gave this CD as a gift to my son who had driven clear from middle of PA to near Gloucester, MA to see her perform it in concert.  I know it will be loved and appreciated.
0743496728|5.0|Being a teacher and a parent I found this book to be extremly relevant to todays school system. It was coincidental, but I had just finished reading it when the West VA. shootings took place. Recommend this for all parents, teachers, and students. The author is right on topic in this novel. The book will certainly give you an acute awareness of the pressures that our students face everyday.  It is riviting and you will not be able to put it down.*****
B000G1T072|4.0|First heard this on a college radio station and thought it was a new re-mix club/dub mix that was the bomb. Scored it on Amazon only to find out it was the Original. Some cuts I think are great but the overall style is too repetitive with the bongo solos for all the songs. I think the purchase was worth it for Apache alone but many won't like the stylings of 70's funk with the Mancini like strings and the bongo flavorings. For collectors mostly.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I'm in a fairly unique position amongst DT fans because I'm one of the few people who doesn't think they lost direction at some specific moment.  Granted, \\"Falling into Infinity\\" is a major misstep and the weakest Labrie album by far, but other than that I don't see a lot of peaks and valleys for them over the last 16 years.  Thus, I don't have any particular hopes or fears or expectations when a new DT album comes around, neither begging for a return to whatever, nor fearing any specific trend.  I figure I'll probably like it, whatever it is.  That said, I can guess how others will receive this, and I'm confident in supposing that most people who particularly favor I&W and Awake, and who chafe at the excesses of SFAM and later will not be especially pleased with \\"Systematic Chaos\\".  Similarly, if you thought that \\"Train of Thought\\" sucked and that \\"Octavarium\\" was something of a return to form, you'll probably find this disappointing, since it moves back towards ToT, bringing back the intensity and instrumental emphasis of that album.  Many have described \\"Systematic Chaos\\" as a mix of those two albums, and I think this is a pretty solid description.  All in all, this is not earth-shattering, but it is memorably written and impeccably performed, all with the melodicism and grand technicality that you'd expect, nay, demand from Dream Theater.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about \\"Systematic Chaos\\" was the terrific production, easily the best of any DT album, with a great, powerful guitar-tone for Petrucci and some thick but not overbearing drums for Portnoy.  Hopefully they can maintain the level of excellence for later albums  From a songwriting standpoint, \\"Systematic Chaos\\" has a nice mixture of styles, ranging from thrashy, twisting rockers to ballads to bleak, atmospheric pieces to their typical grand epics.  This album ought to particularly appeal to those who consider themselves more metal than prog oriented, as it's definitely their heaviest album apart from ToT.  \\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" are the two most metal intensive tracks here, with powerful prog-thrash riffing and some shouted/gang vox, though they both still have memorable, melodic choruses.  Best of all, they reign in Ruddess on these tracks, as their heavier tracks have been too often marred by inappropriate synth work.  \\"Prophets of War\\" is another rocker, though it's a bit different, with a sort of metallic-techno vibe through the first half.  It's not a great track, but it's a solid, interesting one, particularly since it mines some new ground, which doesn't happen all that often anymore with DT.<br /><br />\\"Forsaken\\", \\"Repentance\\" and \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\" are all ballads, of sorts.  \\"Forsaken\\" is more of a conventional power-ballad, with an absolutely huge chorus, by far the most epic sounding thing they've ever done.  Some people may find it a little too grasping, but it works on me.  Works really well, in fact.  \\"Repentance\\" seemed like a complete waste of time initially, but it's grown on me a bit.  This is one of the simpler, subtler pieces they've written, focusing on a few simple vocal melodies, some hypnotic rhythm work underneath and distant, reverberating lines from the guitars and 'boards.  I enjoy it now, though it's still a bit long in the tooth.  \\"Ministry...\\" is an epic at 14+ minutes, though it's not as ambitious as some of their longer stuff, as it's mostly just another very well-done but standard ballad with one of their trademark, flailing, time-signature shifting instrumental sections thrown in for good measure.  This combination isn't entirely appropriate, but both parts work individually, so I can't complain much.<br /><br />\\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" Pts. I-II are the centerpiece of the album and also the strongest tracks.  Comparisons to \\"Octavarium\\" are unavoidable, and \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" clearly comes out ahead in my mind.  This is a rare ultra-epic song that actually feels like onelong, winding composition, rather than a bunch of shorter songs which were simply pieced together, a la 6DOIT.  It has one of Labrie's most memorable, impassioned vocal performances ever to go with plenty of powerful riffing and effective atmospherics.  It's also more restrained than you might expect, not venturing off on DT's typical flights of fancy quite so much.  Granted, it has a 5 minute instrumental intro and a 5 minute break, but at 25 minutes long that's not too bad, and the intro is fairly structurally stable and melodic, not the sort of wankfest you typically associate with DT.  Now, the latter one definitely is your standard DT wankfest, but that's fine so long as they keep it within reason, which is what they've done.  Anyway, though it's tough to make these declarations after only a few days, I think \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" will definitely go down as one of my favorite DT compositions.  It's certainly uber-dramatic and  a bit cheesy at a few instances, but that's part of the fun, and they make it work, as they always do.<br /><br />Well, I suppose I've rambled on long enough, so I'll cut things off.  In conclusion, if you're looking for some grand revolution from Dream Theater, you're not gonna be too pleased with \\"Systematic Chaos\\".  It's pretty much just more of the same, but what can you expect?  This is what has got `em where they are today, so I don't expect them to tinker with the formula too much.

B000GFLE1S|4.0|Great fun, music, dancing and a serious undertone, about acceptance and tolerance. Chiwetel Ejiofor has great range and depth, a real delight on screen. Loved it!

B000P46QIG|4.0|I'm new to Planet X and bought this mainly because I read Holdsworth played on it. Actually, he only plays on two tracks, and on one of these tracks, he only solos for 44 seconds. Brett Garsed plays guitar on the other tracks. Anyway, I'm really enjoying this disc. The music is instrumental rock/metal that sounds similar to Andy West's [[ASIN:B00006J3ZM Rama 1]]. The credits list Virgil Donati (drums) and Derek Sherinian (keys) as Planet X, and in the liner notes, their photos are bigger than the guest musician's photos. Ha! Virgil wrote eight of the nine songs, the other is a collaborative effort. There are some tricky grooves happening with insane time changes executed with ease, and at times it seems the complex music was written so they could show off, but why not if your talented and have the chops? On bass guitar, Rufus Philpot plays on two songs and the outstanding Holdsworth alumni Jimmy Johnson plays on the remaining tracks. If you crave high-energy instrumental music, you should check this out.

B00004SZWD|5.0|I never really considered myself a Stevie Wonder fan, but after listening to this album, I realize why people love him so much.  The songs off this album have been sampled and re-recorded by so many other artists it's scary!  His R&B songwriting was second to none during the mid 70s.
B000OMD4BG|4.0|This is without a doubt an excellent album with numerous beautiful songs that I will surely listen to over and over for the next few weeks. However, as stated in the CD description the album is recorded on almost all accoustic guitar with only vocal accompaniment (or visa versa, whatever). This does not neccesarily detract from the songs at all, but I personally prefer to have a little diversity in the arrangements. For instance, I would have liked more songs for guitar, piano, and drums as in some of the brilliant songs from XO. DO NOT GET ME WRONG, there are many EXCELLENT simplistic and even a few with multiple instuments that are destined to be classics in my library. Furthermore, as always, Smith's vocal melodies and instrumental are creative and interesting (and BEAUTIFUL). All in all, buy the album.
B000002G7G|4.0|Funny that I found out barely that Maureen Tucker was a female playing drums in this controversial band. She could have told Nico to stick around but I guess Nico went her own ways, detesting the noise that the Velvets created. Is this album any different from those hard-to-listen-to albums they had previously released? Well, it is. The Velvets took it soft this time with the inclusion of Doug Yule, in which his presence and orientation to the band softened the Velvet's noisy background and set a warm environment. This one is easy to listen to. John Cale was gone. And Lou Reed has just the power to make good tunes. Such that reflect this are \\"Jesus\\", \\"Candy Says\\", and \\"After Hours\\", which was featured in the trailer for \\"The Science of Sleep\\". \\"The Murder Mystery\\" is a gem. It's great and thought-provoking listening to the ping-pong vocals in stereo. One vocalist is in the right side saying things and the other saying things also in the opposite side. Listen to it with headphones and immerse yourself in an ethereal experience with this song. The album delivers genuinely.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I loved the movie. I also ordered the book to read. And now I've got the music. There is not a track that I don't just love. This is my most listened to CD of late ! If you loved the movie this is a must have !!!
B000JJRIN4|5.0|That sums it up right there. This album is so misunderstood and being known as a bad album. The reason that this is happening...Gwen totally switched music styles on us. L.A.M.B. continued to follow the wave of mainstream pop. Now, we realize Gwen is taking a whole different route. So, if you're looking for mainstream pop style, you won't find it here. I believe the negative reviewers for this album were looking for that and realized it can't be found here. This is a very fun, original type of dance/club album. There are so many great beats here as well. It's a great album to dance to, and on the slower tunes, to just relax. It's a perfect mix of club and ballads that should be well-appreciated. Like another reviewer said, \\"Shell out and have a good time!\\"  The Highlights:  Wind It Up  The Sweet Escape  Early Winter  4 In The Morning  Yummy  Flourescent

This is a must have.
B000O179A4|2.0|This movie was Ok. I didn't really care for it! It's not as great as the people say it was. I wish the ended was different. The singing was good! I think there was too much singing in the film, Each time a problem came up they would sing about it! I like it in a sence that it talks about how black weren't treated equal in the music business or any where else. I like how it showed a white guy making a hit from a black guys song! That's what they did back then! \\"You Know!\\" I think if you like musical and like the pros and cons of the white's and blacks then this film is for you. <br />I hope you take this  film into consideration. <br />~Enjoy the movie~
B000NQR7KM|5.0|Many great reviews on this already.  It was a treat to see the videos.  You can play this in your regular CD player and you will hear SO many different parts.  I can only imagine what this would sound like on a SACD player.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I have tried to purchase every possible version of this cd paid hundreds of dollars for the so call 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th press...only to be disappointed by all of them.LET ME PUT AN END TO ALL THE SPECULATION AND CONFUSSION...THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY ULTIMATE IN SOUND QUALITY PERIOD.The only catch is that you must have a SUPER AUDIO MULTICHANNEL SURROUND SYSTEM....the sound quality will leave you speachless.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna's new album is a solid release versus her other efforts but this one was all over the place. There was no consistency she was goin all over the place with the types of music she was trying to display. It took me a couple of listens before I was able to get into it. The first single and best track on the album \\"Umbrella\\" was definitely a good way to kick off the album. The next two track \\"Push up on Me\\", and \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" will have u on your feet. The Michael Jackson sample puts this track over the edge. \\"Breakin Dishes\\" Rihanna is breaking on her man who she feels isn't doing her right. I do agree with another reviewer that it reminds you of Beyonce's \\"Ring the alarm\\". The second single \\"Shut Up and Drive\\" is skippable if you're not into \\"rock music\\" but it will please her pop fans and will probably be on MTV's TRL. The Ne-Yo duet \\"Hate that I Love U\\" is a nice song it mellows out the album a bit from the dance tracks and their voices sound good together. \\"Say It\\" and \\"Sell me candy\\" are skippable, \\"Lemme get That\\" is Rihanna talking about spending someone else's dough instaed of her own. The last three tracks are mediocre but worth a listen. I respect Rihanna for changing her style but I don't really think she went \\"bad\\", but the Rihanna fans won't be disappointed

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is great television, great sci-fi and a great character driven glimpse into one possible future to come... A future without aliens to threaten us ... where people are the monsters and friends and family are the protectors of they're own clans, but they are also people and so they can fail and also forgive each other when they do ...    Gone from this work are the convenient easy outs like are the stuff of every scifi program ever ... the super weapons, the transporters the food replicators the holodecks where Jack the Ripper becomes  real, for some silly reason terrorizes the squeaky clean crew for 45 minutes until the convent plot device figures out how to stop it...   lol...    Instead we get gritty dirty worlds inhabited by people who work love and lust for each other ... people who desire wealth and power and people who just want to live and be left alone to live free and as they see fit to... however while are often the heroes of these tales ... they are also the minority in this world ... as most folk live in the more refined and technologically advanced societies of the central planets, governed by a bureaucratic socialized big brother system of class based civilization ...   A world where our heroes are crooks,and ,in the eyes of the government and the majority of the population , terrorists and pirates... or faceless laborers who toil on distant worlds to supply materials to facilitate the technology and comforts of they're lives ... little thought given to the blood and sweat spilled in the process by laborers and slaves who are conveniently ignored by the federal government who need these materials.   Often people cant understand why horses and powder weapons are used ... The answer is easy ... horses make other horses, dont need paved roads and eat what is grown from seed ... powder weapons can be fixed and fixed again on the fly and ammunition can be assembled and reloaded from raw stock by the user ... There is high tech in this universe , butnot all of it is practical for use on the frontier ...       This is a very compelling, challenging, insightful and complex work... It is often very funny, exciting, and even heartwarming ... I first watched this on FOX and bought the DVD set the day it was released ... I have viewed the shows many times since and buy new sets from time to time to share with people. I am not really a fan of Joss' work  except for Firefly and have never, before or since been a \\"Fan Boy\\" of any show...    One interesting note, copies of both the FF DVD set and Serenity are presently included in the payload of the space shuttle and will be aboard the International Space Station thanks to Browncoats at NASA!! How cool is that?!
B000EQHHJW|4.0|I think this opera contains Verdi's best tunes.This production <br />is very spectacular and dramatic with much outdoor action. Top class performers of course, though a prettier soprano could have been better. <br />For adult viewing only because some parts are fairly raw.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Like many other Bond fans, I genuinely enjoyed the Brosnan films...up until the second half of Die Another Day.  Goldeneye and it's slick, underrated follow-up Tomorrow Never Dies are modern Bond classics in my opinion, and The World Is Not Enough is consistently interesting when things aren't randomly exploding.  However, an invincible Bond was getting tiresome, and in these more cynical days, Bond fans needed a return to Ian Fleming's dark, somewhat sociopathic protagonist.    Although the realistic but generally dull Jason Bourne and the silly, over-the-top Jack Bauer managed to steal some of Bond's thunder in the past few years, the makers of Casino Royale stopped these rather temporary franchises dead in their tracks.       Martin Campbell, Paul Haggis, and the Purvis-Wade combo have created a flim that is both new and old.  It's new in that it shows us the edgier, harder side of Bond that fans haven't seen since Dalton's performance in Licence to Kill.  It also gives fans a taste of the nihilism and narcissism that surrounded Bond's character in Ian Fleming's novels.  It's old because the film harkens back to the classic Connery films, with lush cinematography, a bold musical score, and some truly spectacular action sequences.      Then there's Daniel Craig himself.  While it may not be the most familiar or accessible Bond performance (that honor goes to Connery in From Russia With Love), it is in my opinion the overall best.  Physically and psychologically, Craig transforms himself into the iconic British agent and brilliantly handles both the action sequences and the quieter moments of contemplation and dialogue.    Overall, Casino Royale achieved the impossible and reinvigorated a franchise that's nearly half a century old.  I just hope that the follow-up is as inspired and competently-handled as this was.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|I thought that Dream Theater's amazing carrer was soon to be coming to an end, until 'Systematic Chaos' was relased. These boys from Long Island knew that it was time to bring something to the fans to let them know that it's not the end just yet. The title of this cd really explains the mood of this album.<br /><br />These guys surley did their homework. Because not only do you see an excellent mix of various sounds from their past records you also get a vibe of the bands entire discography. Through most of the songs you can hear the melocholy softness of 'Falling Into Infinity' to the hard hitting rush of 'Train Of Thought' all around you can the complexity yet steady flow of 'Scenes From A Memory'<br /><br />There was definitley alot of time that went into observing the rest of the metal world. In the past few years Metal has been evolving by looking to the roots of the genre of music to create a new taste for us metalheads. There are displays of that reseach in this album moslty in the European area. Some of the bands you can hear in this cd are Nightwish, Stratovarius, Lacuna Coil and new sounds of Megadeth. Constant Motion is by far the best track on this cd. It is such a smooth flowing in your face hard rock hit. The thing that impressed me the most about this cd is that they had to go back and look at their whole career and realized that they have comoe so far and have evolved so much since 1992, why stop now? The journey has just begun.
0143038095|4.0|Each and everyday, our generation continues to expand its range of different ethnicities and backgrounds as more families immigrant to the U.S. What Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club proves to show is the universal yet distinctive everyday conflicts of ethnic parents raising American children.  <br /> In this novel, readers begin a journey with four Chinese mothers and daughters through series of storytelling-including all woman taking a flashback to their childhood or some previous memory.  <br />  Moreover, the novel extracts how the American lifestyle that is somewhat different to the lifestyle the mother's were accustomed to creates a gap between the mother and daughters. The Joy Luck Club itself is a club where one mother, Suyuan Woo, created with three other Chinese woman in order to save and collect money as a group and bring up the spirits through the hard times of WWII. After Suyuan dies, her daughter, Jing-mei, has to fill her spot in the club as she finds out more about her mother than ever before, for example, Jing-mei discover she has two half-sisters. This novel creates a character that is able to grow with the reader as she finds out more about her mother's life and ultimately her own life as well. The discoveries allow not only Jing-mei but the readers as well to leave the book with hope as a closer bond with her mother is formed. Jing-mei creates closure with her mother's death as the readers and Jing-mei herself learn the sacrifices and loyalties of all for mothers when raising their daughters.  <br /> Since the novel is divided into four major parts, in which the mothers speak out in the first section, readers never seized to boredom, for there is a new exciting adventure that begins as each mother and daughter tells their own story. Even though the structure contributes to grasping the readers attention, readers may find it hard to collect and remember all the stories together.  <br /> <br />
006056251X|5.0|This book rates right up there with Gaelen Foley's Lord of Ice, Julia Quinn's When He Was Wicked and Julia London's Ruthless Charmer as one of the best historical love stories I've read.  When this book hit shelves last year, I picked it up, read the back and put it back deciding it probably wouldn't be one I'd enjoy, not realizing it was one in a series.  I bought Scandal in Spring recently, loved it and went in search of the other Wallflower books.  It Happened One Autumn was just as enjoyable.  I recently bought this one and wasn't really enthusiastic about reading it, especially when I realized that Evie was going to hook up with St. Vincent, who started out charming enough in the second book but, by the end, he was even remotely appealing.  I couldn't imagine how he was ever going to redeem himself or even make himself likeable. But as soon as I started reading, I began to like him.  He was the expected arrogant, despicable jerk in the first couple chapters but once he and Evie hit the road to Gretna Green, I began to like him.  They were a truly unlikely pair - the gorgeous, self-centered, promiscuous rake and the stuttering, shy, unnoticable redhead. What appealed to me the most about him was how wonderfully affectionate he was toward her throughout the entire book. How he protected her, treated her with such care and and when she stuttered, instead of mocking her about it, which someone like him would probably do, he recognized it for what it was and tried to ease her anxiousness.  By the end of the book, I was half in love with him. Especially when he whispered those words, \\"my love is upon you\\" at the end. This is easily one of the best historicals I've read. <br /> <br />
0060090367|5.0|Well, I just loved this book.  Yes, after a while it's pretty clear how it will all work out, but sometimes we need an obvious happy ending to a book or movie to lift our spirits.  Not to mention Marian Keyes is an amazing author.
B000FZETKC|5.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine since it first came out. The characters are very well done and the actors perfectly matched to character. The music blends well. In the CD, the special features enhance the enjoyment with interviews of the actors and director in current time. I thought for awhile this film was out of print and was very excited to be able to purchase it!
B00005IC2H|5.0|<br /> Received in a timely fashion. Couldn;t be happier with the condition. Mahalo!
B000002TWN|5.0|I don't know why I didn't purchase D'Angelo's CD when he first hit the airwaves, but this CD has become on of my all-time favorites!  Between this and Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite you can't miss!
B000P0J02E|5.0|Hans Zimmer has truly outdone himself with the Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End soundtrack. Unlike the first two soundtracks, (the first by Klaus Badelt, the second by himself), this one is far more orchestral. Zimmer utilizes far more of the orchestra than the two previous soundtrack, with beautiful, chilling upper string harmonies. Klaus Badelt tended to rely the lower horns and brass instruments (he had an amazing soundtrack as well, but it lacked the variety of Zimmer's). Zimmer shows his ability to blend strings, winds, percussion, and vocals to produce incredibly moving melodies, painting an exquisite image of the heroic and bittersweet pirate's life that he/she wants to listen again and again.  <br /> My favorites on this soundtrack are: (I have yet to see the movie) <br /> -Singapore: Contrary to what previous reviewers said, I think this piece is beautifully crafted. It is not too slow, and you can easily picture a misty Asian harbor and hear with wooden fans opening. Zimmer skillfully incorporates traditional Asian instruments with a pirate-esque urgency. And as expected, Zimmer opens into the exciting theme of Pirates.  <br /> -At Wit's End: There is such beauty in the harmonies that Zimmer creates with the vocals and upper strings. At the midpoint, he adds horns and percussion, probably to show Jack's wonder and fright upon entering the End of the World. The melody of this piece becomes a central theme for the rest of the soundtrack. I'm assuming this piece is used for the End of the World, with its eeriness and majesty.  <br /> -What Shall We Die For: This is such a moving piece! The violin runs into brilliant chords, accompanied with vocals and percussion bring chills. This piece reflects the end of an age (according to the previews, the age of the pirates), and their fight for their way of life. There is such majesty and strength, yet desperation and sadness in this piece.  <br /> -I Don't Think Now Is the Best Time: The song for the final fight of the movie. Zimmer brings themes of the past movies and this movie into this piece, brilliantly layering and transitioning between them. The pirates theme is layered with (and counters) their oppressors' theme, portraying the fight. The listener can feel the strength and passion in the fight, as well as the light-hearted parts (I'm guessing when Jack Sparrow is in the scene). The horn and brass parts, with vocals and strings, fills the heart of anyone who loves adventure, the ideals of heroism, and freedom.  <br /> -One Day: A piece that is sad and hopeful at the same time. Zimmer takes the original Pirates theme and rearranges it beautifully. Using middle and lower strings, he builds a rich, touching, and sad arrangement that brings tears if one lets the music fill his/her. <br /> Drink Up Me Hearties: The essential Pirates theme to wrap a wonderful soundtrack and movie! Not before a brilliant arrangement of another theme, though! <br /> <br />Hans Zimmer is incredible. I especially admire his ability to transition so skillfully between themes; so much that I go back and listen to just how he transitions. I love his variety of instruments and themes, probably because I prefer playing in string-heavy orchestras rather than brass-heavy ensembles. As a musician, I would love to do a far more in-depth analysis, but I would bore you all. Concesssion: because Zimmer had the past themes to build upon, I guess he had an advantage when it came to variety compared to Klaus Badelt. I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who loves the movies and/or adventure/orchestral music! Enjoy! <br />
0061015725|5.0|I rather enjoyed Michael Crichton's Prey.  I like how he takes his fictional stories, and backs them up with a good deal of factual support and evidence.  I like how he used a somewhat (hopefully in the near future) thought of nano-robots that can be used to see anywhere throughout the human body.  It is also an intriguing read because it has the twist and addition of the theory of \\"A.I\\" (Artificial Intelligence), which is a very popular thought and idea shared by people and moviemakers.  Such movies have been made on the premise of A.I., such as I, Robot, A.I., and the Terminator movies.  There are a bunch of twists and turns that keep you intrigued and make you not want to put the book down.  There were times where I had a hard time putting it down because I was soo into the book.  The book provides a topic that is now in the open and starting to be looked into.  There have already been advances in medicine and science regarding tiny robotic cameras that can be ingested via pill cap that take pictures of the inside of the body.  It is the starting point to where nano-robots might appear in the near future.  Michael Crichton's Prey is one recommended to those who love A.I. thrillers and those who seek the frontline field in science regarding literature.
0374105235|3.0|To read of this young lads youth opens your eyes on how lives in some parts of our world are lived. It makes you sad that we do so little to stop these horrors. He made it , so many did not.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|<br /> <br />   Great DVD!!!!   I lost my original, and had to get another!! <br />  Great service, and I liked the price.........The way to go!!!
0307346609|5.0|Super fun.  Just absolutely mind-blowingly great.  Traces the history of a global zombie outbreak and the human resistance in dozens of locations, in the format of a collection of survivor accounts.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This film is GREAT. it makes in my openion the rather boring story of cinderella into a fantastic love story. it is the type of film that you could watch over and over and over again. simply GREAT!
B000NDIAWY|4.0|We listened Brandi live when she opened for Train in Madison, WI sometime ago. For her -I'm sure- it was a tall order considering how powerful Train is while playing live. Yet, she was up to the task with a superb voice. Then when she signed our CD (her first), we were so flabbergasted by her young age and charm. Intriguingly in her two CDs the sound does not reflect her vocal prowess.  <br /> <br />I tend to agree with prior reviews about a bit of lackadaisical creativity/energy in the middle of this CD (compared to her first one). Yet, Brandi's soft melodical vocalization mellows that inconsistency, such as in the first part of \\"Again Today\\".  <br /> <br />Nonetheless, one song makes this whole album valuable: \\"The Story\\". When I bought the CD I had to repeat it several times just to make sure it was for real: \\"All of these lines across my face / tell you the story of who I am / so many stories / of where I've been.\\" And then, as the song progresses there's this guitar solo so simple but so timely. And then there's the powerful beat of those drums anticipating the climax: Brandi screaming at the top of her lungs \\"ALL OF THESE LINES ACROSS MY FACE!!!!\\" If you want the full effect, just close down doors and windows and raise the basses a bit (you need those drums to pound your heart), and turn up the volume. Sing-along... if you can follow Brandi's vocal fireworks.  <br /> <br />Memorable!
0765316978|4.0|The Last Colony is the third and apparently final book in the series that started with \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades\\".  In Old Man's War we were introduced to John Perry, a soldier who volunteers in the Colonial Defence Force and steadily rises through the ranks while being involved in numerous battles with alien races.  The Ghost Brigades dealt more with the mysterious CDF special forces and special forces soldier Jane Sagan who eventually marries Perry when they both retire from the CDF.    The Last Colony finds Perry and Sagan living in semi retirement on a Colony world with their adopted daughter Zoe and her two alien minders.  They are offered the role of administrators of a new colony world rather ominously named Roanoke after the failed 16th century english colony in North America.  The colonists for this world are drawn from numerous other colony worlds elsewhere in human space which is a new way of doing it as previous colonists came directly from earth.    All is not what it seems however as the colonists are settled on a completely different planet to the original Roanoke.  The reason for this is to apparently deceive a previously unknown (at least to the colonists) alien confederation called the Conclave who have decreed that no further colonies from races outside the Conclave are to be allowed.  Things get even worse though when Perry and Sagan find that the Conclave is not quite the evil organisation that the human Colonial Union says it is and in fact Roanoke is a pawn in an elaborate plot to discredit and destroy the Conclave.  Perry has to juggle political alliances and call in favours in order to guarantee Roanoke's survival.      John Scalzi has that rare gift amongst science fiction authors of being able to combine believable characters that you can relate to with feasible science and mix it all together into a good story and he is definitely a great new talent.  Still, I didn't think this was quite as good as \\"Old Man's War\\".  The Colonial Union plot seems incredibly risky and ham fisted for an organisation like this to even contemplate and the alien protagonists aren't terribly competent.  It's still a comfortable four stars though.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth is a very nice HD DVD box set. Very good scenery  filmed in high defintion. The video quality is superb.  They've done stunning camera work in this film. I just love it.
0061122416|5.0|It took me long enough to finally get my hands on this book. I've read a number of his later works and they were all awesome.  The Alchemist is very simply written, no fancy language, he just gives you the story straight.  And I love the message.....you got a dream, pursue is tirelessly, and watch as life opens doors to help that dream come true. It's a quick read and you'll love it.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|First of all, I'd like to assert the fact that I don't particularly care if Dream Theater plays prog, pop, metal, folk, or gospel, or whether a track is 4 minutes or 25 minutes - because it's almost ALWAYS amazing, and 99% of the time it's at least better than almost anything else out there.    Though I felt that Train of Thought was a bit sterile, the SONGS were great.   I loved the diversity of Octavarium.  I'm not one of these guys who thinks anything after Images and Words was sub-par.  And though there are usually moments (\\"seconds\\", to be specific) of music on each album that I don't care for 99% of the time it isn't enough for me to end up disliking a song or album.    And I usually consider how much an album impresses me by my least favorite tracks.  If my least favorite tracks are still good (or GREAT, as in Rush's Snakes and Arrows) then the album is great.  With Systematic Chaos, I simply cannot say much good about it, on the whole.    Are there good - even great moments?  Absolutely.  Are there moments that suck?  For the first time in their career, in my opinion, yes.      First, THE BAD:  I know many disagree with this, but \\"Ministry of Lost Souls\\" is a complete bore.  Just plain boring.      \\"In the Presence of Enemies - Part II\\" - the music in the section called \\"The Slaughter of the Damned\\" kicks, but to me the chanting parts of the lyrics are pretty stupid.  Much of the rest of it isn't memorable.      I think \\"Prophets of War\\" is okay at best.  Not fond of the verses, and the fan-chanted chorus isn't mixed well to my ears (I know, how can I be critical of Paul Northfield?).  Instead of \\"Time for change\\" and \\"Fight the fear\\" etc.,  I hear \\"rah, rah, rah\\" and it makes the song sound weak.  I will concede the music in the chorus is very good though.      \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" has incredible music - the main riff especially.  The vocals during the verses are kind of silly, as are the lyrics.  I'm able to overlook that a bit because the music is sogood, and because I'll have to give them credit for trying something different.  I'm tired of Jordan's goofy keyboard interludes in the middle of otherwise great musical passages.  They've done that enough.  We know they can go between musical styles in a flash.  No need to do it in a song about an un-dead pharaoh.      \\"Constant Motion\\" is a good song, but I agree with others that it sounds like a Metallica rip off - and Metallica's pretty boring.  Besides, it sounds like they're saying \\"Constant maoshahun\\".  And \\"forever more, into the night, blistering\\" is just embarrassing.    THE GOOD:  I think \\"Forsaken\\" ranks up there with the best they've ever done. Very well arranged song. \\"In the Presence of Enemies - Part I\\" is fantastic.  I usually don't like spoken words, but I think \\"Repentance\\", though a hair long, is excellent. Very moody and tastefully done.  Great track.      So that concludes my first DT review on Amazon.  As a loyal fan who also owns every official bootleg I think I have earned the right to have an opinion.  I'm sure a lot of folks will disagree with a lot I have written and slaughter me in response.  Just keep in mind that for all these years (since 1994, for me) I have LOVED virtually every second of music they've released.  And though this album is better than most of the drivel that is out there today, I have to give it a low ranking - low relative to their own output.  (2 stars, and an extra star for the DVD). I just hope their next album is better.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Serenity\\" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time... and I don't mean the cinematic release (though that was great too)-- I mean the pilot episode of this great show!!  It's as good as anything I've seen in the theatre, when it comes to writing, characters, plot, world building...the most important stuff!  The writing of this whole series is terrific.  I love how the characters interact, a lot of which is genuinely funny and sometimes very touching.  Even the content that would normally bother me on other shows and movies (mostly the cheapening of God's wonderful gift of sex) is bearable for me here... for instance, Inara is this \\"liberated\\" space prostitute, supposedly the product of a more \\"enlightened\\" time that has done away with out-dated puritanical ethics, but even she longs to share her life with one man (Mal)...reflecting God's original design for us.  For adults and older children who can think discerningly on issues like this, I recommend Firefly for its impressive writing, acting, etc., but also for the illustrations of truth in the midst of a broken world (which in the show is their \\"verse,\\" but it looks a lot like the universe we live in as well).
B000MNP2KI|1.0|This is a really great Bond movie. However, this DVD is playable but the sound track is wierd.  It fades in and out and surround is inaudible.  I have all sony equipment but I am very dissapointed in the quality of this disc's poor sound track to say the least. See it in the theater but don't buy the dvd. It does not play well. <br /> <br />Other reviews point out some technical reasons why this may be happening, I am not so savy, but if the negative reviews are correct I may never buy a sony product again.
0767020308|5.0|This was a watch over and over friendly adaptation of Emma and captured the book very, very well!!  In fact, my whole family found it witty, sweet, well adapted.  It is colorful and fulfilling.  I will be sure to put it next to my favorite Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, and watch it again often.
B000GX8B9I|5.0|This is the most gritty, fast-paced, and accurrate war movie I have ever seen. That said, don't expect this movie to have the usual character development and personal dramas. The whole point is to tell the story of the conflict in Mogadishu and show the world the bravery of those men as well as the reason they fight. The scenes are shakey and chaotic and it is important to watch the movie more than once if you want to pick up all the details. The all-star cast gives a solid performance, however, I do have to comment that Orlando Bloom and Ewan McGregor need to work on their American accents. This film is a resounding success.
006085880X|5.0|Well, I love Jodi Picoult, so of course I loved this book. It had just enough humor, love, and tragedy for me. I definitely cried a few times, but I love that, don't you? If you are looking for a great book to really dive into, this is for you. I love how Jodi can make you feel like you are a part of the book and also how she creates her characters; they are very true to life in my opinion. Overall, I feel that this book was worth the read.
0793518326|4.0|This book is seriously da bomb!!  But it loses 1 star for not having the keyboard part for Dig A Pony.  Come on now...it's supposed to be COMPLETE!!
0312426984|4.0|I was surprisingly entertained by this unusual story. I thought the author's style was very unique and original. I will definitely try another Schine novel when I need a change of pace. <br /> <br />The plot is basically about a 42 year-old divorced woman that falls for a 20 year-old college student that comes to work for her in her book store over the summer break. And they have a torrid affair and fall in love.
B000MQ54OO|4.0|It's a movie with a message!<br /><br />It's a movie about the environment!<br /><br />It's a \\"musical\\" whether you asked for it or not!<br /><br />Didn't I say: It's not your average animation movie?<br /><br />Try renting at Netflix or Blockbuster before you buy.<br /><br />Stunning picture! and a nice animation movie. It's not what you'd expect from a regular animation though. I like it especially the adorable little baby penguin.\\"<br /><br />A great HD DVD transfer, very bright and colorful!
0385302320|5.0|Voyager is the third in a series of six, commonly known as The Outlander Series. It is an original story and Diana Gabaldon has an incredible gift! Her writing style places you in the story, the details are such that you feel everything that is going on within the story. This collection is a remarkable tail of Claire, a nurse from 1945 and Jamie, a Highlander from 1746. The story is not your typical romance novel...It is much more, and it offers a great escape into a world that contains History (fictional), love, passion, death, murder, betrayal, adventure, and political intrigue!  <br />I recommend all of her books.
B000093BDX|5.0|If CDs could wear out, I'd be buying a new one by now.  If you're a Beach Boys fan, you'll love this CD. If you're not, buy it and you will be.
0688145078|5.0|My nearly three year old loves this book--I find him quoting lines out of it when he talks about our new baby on the way. The text and illustrations are simple enough for him to understand and hold his interest. It is very positive and doesn't bring up jealousy issues but rather emphasizes all the good things about being an older sibling. If you are expecting and are trying to prepare your little one for the upcoming arrival then I do recommend this book.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|but very engaging and attention holding.  I enjoyed it very much but I AM glad I read the book first.  Helped a lot with understanding.
B00006LLJ4|5.0|this movie is worth buying, the plot and the actors are very good. i'd recommmend this to everybody.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The photographic quality of this series is spellbinding.  The narration and production is perfect.  I planned to watch thirty minutes of the first disc and \\"stayed\\" for three hours! Anyone wishing to have the highest quality viewing of extraordinary plants, animals and natural ecosystems will not find an equal to this five-disc series.  Casual viewers will be mesmerized.  \\"Planet Earth\\" must be the definitive reference source for photographs of the inhabitants of our natural world for years to come.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|Wow this little girl is talented, blows other 20 something stars away. Can't wait to see where her career will go.
B00079018K|5.0|I recomend this for everyone who loves Rock. It's english and has some english slang. It is hard hitting and so very fun. I love it. It's a favorite CD.
B000003C5C|5.0|Raw and brutal  If you don't have this one you are seriously missing out on a great DM album from a great metal band.
B000000OTU|5.0|Received sooner than expected and was in perfect condition!!! One of my favorite CD's of all time...
B000FVQYZY|5.0|If you already like Muse then you will naturally love this cd, if you don't know them then this is a good one to start out with.  They are rock stars after all, so it was fun to see them in the DVD.
B0000AFX64|3.0|I remember watching battlestar when I was a kid and hadn't seen it for a long time...man I didn't remember it being sooo cheesy. It was fun to watch anyways. I laughed a lot - and not because it was meant to be funny...I'm just glad they re-did battlestar!!
B000NVIXDW|4.0|This CD is for fans of the old time singers, Dean Martin,Louie Prima, Frank Sinatra. Buble has been compared to Sinatra but Buble can really sing. This is a great CD for relaxing after a hard day. I would definitely buy more of his CDs.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|The edge of your seat is where you'll be once the movie gets rolling. It's a nail-biting ride based on survival of the \\"smartest\\". Don't misunderstand...there's not a slow start. This movie merely takes a brief time to set an interesting background which is crucial to the plot. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant, as usual. Hopkins plays an extremely well-read Billionairre who \\"knows everything\\" according to his wife, Elle MacPherson, who of course plays a super-model. There are plenty of twists and surprises to keep you guessing to the very end. I found the last scene to be a little less than ideal. It's somewhat confusing and unnecessary. It is also a little unrealistic. Also, I still don't see the point of the title, \\"The Edge\\". Probably just my lack of imagination. Other than that, this movie is well worth the money! Both thumbs up!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Although this CD is different from the usual sound, this is still a great CD. I've listened to it almost everyday since I got it. The first three songs are the best but the rest of the CD is great also. Anyone who likes LP should definitely buy this CD.
1592402038|5.0|This is a great book if you are like me: didn't pay too much attention in school early on when I was young and now striving to finish a graduate degree. It is very humorous. Strongly recommend it!
B00005JPHT|4.0|This film highlights a subject that many of us intuitively understand or have experienced through the years - our health care system is in crisis and it can be a struggle to get claims covered, even if you have decent insurance. For those without insurance, it is a horror story.<br /><br />I related to this movie because I know that simply keeping track of the paperwork and communicating between the doctors and the insurance company takes a great deal of my time. It didn't used to. Something, indeed, has changed for the worst.<br /><br /> For one thing, companies often delay payments until a patient's credit rating is in peril or impacted. I have seen friends have to bug insurance companies, in spite of the fact that they are paying premiums to these companies, to pay on time even when paperwork is properly submitted. This should not be. The company should be doing its job, insuring those who need their services, paying for appropriate medical care. People should not have to have their credit rating jeopardized or have to make a choice between paying the high costs themselves, somehow, even if they are financially stressed to the max...and then hope the insurance company will reimburse them..someday.<br /><br />  Listen to Linda Peeno's admission that she denied a patient proper care in spite of the fact that she knew this could cause death and that she continued to deny care in order to help a company maximize its profits - and she did so again and again, with encouragement and support by the company. I hope this will give you pause.<br /><br />  As far as personal experience goes, I left a hospital emergency room after being told nothing was seriously wrong with me. A nurse had checked the box that indicated they'd looked at the injection site where they'd taken blood and left a \\"tap\\" in case they needed to get medication into me quickly. I was instructed not to removed the gauze over the site till I got home. Imagine my surprise to discover they'd left two needles in me, taps fully in place! I actually took them out myself. So why did they check the box indicating they'd done it and that I'd been fully cleared to leave. I did negotiate a reduction on my bill but this certainly did nothing to make me feel more confident about the care I got that day.

B00008G9JO|5.0|Jethro Tull was a band that seemed to be in a constant state of evolution both musically and with it's personnel.  The mainstays to this day remain Ian Anderson and Martin Barre with a whole cast of others who have come and gone over the years.  The lineup on this one consisted of Anderson and Barre along with John Evan (keys), Barrymore Barlow (drums), John Glascock (bass), and David Palmer (keys and orchestral arrangements).  It was actually one of Tull's best lineups from a musical perspective and all of the individual musicians shine on this one.  Jethro Tull is the only band that I can think of that could get away with doing an album whose main subjects are plow horses, mice, and farm implements.  This is a very different album from just about anything most non Tull fans will have ever heard, but somehow the band makes it work beautifully.  The music is a continuation of the folk, prog, rock that was so prevalent on the previous disc \\"Songs From The Wood\\".  The lyrics are some of Anderson's most clever with a few slight trips here and there.  The two longer tracks on the album \\"No Lullaby\\" and the title track are both great allowing the band to expand their musical palate.  The shorter songs are all great too with their earthy music and lyrics.  The one thing that I do notice on this disc however is that this seems to be the first time that you start to hear some deterioration in Ian Anderson's voice.  Maybe it was recorded like it is on purpose, but there is defiantly a growley undertone to his vocals and his range does not seem to be quite up to previous albums.  Other than that though, this is another solid Jethro Tull album and fits right in among the bands better efforts.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Great flick that delivers on many levels - fantasy, suspense, politics, philosophy..  The 'three faction clash' scene was breathtaking.
B00000GAIW|5.0|\\"Aqualung\\" would turn out to be Jethro Tull's biggest studio album of their career.  It contains the band's two huge classic rock anthems \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and the title track \\"Aqualung\\" that probably get as much airplay today on classic rock radio as they did back when they were released.  The album was a bit of a transition for Tull.  Their previous stuff had been mainly blues based, while this album moved the band in a more progressive / arena rock direction.  Guitarist Martin Barre really comes to the fore front on this one and creates some of his all time best work.  Ian Anderson begins to introduce his acoustic / folk leanings as well which would become an even bigger part of the overall Tull sound on later albums like \\"Songs From The Wood\\".  The album is divided into two halves.  The first have entitled \\"Aqualung\\" are songs themed around homelessness and general down and out characters of Aqualung himself and others like Cross Eyed Mary.  The second half of the album entitled \\"My God\\" mostly concerns religion and Ian Anderson's reaction to it.  The album is not really conceptual (especially when compared to later  albums like \\"Thick As A Brick\\"), but has these central themes running through them.  Many consider this disc their all time classic.  For me I think that the band did better albums, but this certainly ranks up near the top.  For a beginner looking to explore Tull I would think this would be an excellent place to start.  One quick word on the recording, early Tull albums was not recorded very well.  This re-master is better, but it is still not what I would consider great from an audio perspective.
B00070DK1E|5.0|Unfortunately for Jethro Tull most people know this album for having the dubious honor of winning the first best \\"heavy metal / hard rock\\" category at the Grammy awards in 1988.  It has become a running joke over the years since Tull beat out several true metal acts such as Metaillca for the award.  The album has served as a continuous punch line of jokes at awards shows ever since.  The sad thing about all of this is, that this really is a great Tull album and I think it was very cool that it was awarded a Grammy (even if it was not in the right category).  \\"Crest\\" marked a bit of a comeback for Jethro Tull.  The band had not fared so well in the 80's putting out several so so albums that were completely ignored by radio.  Sales figures had slipped significantly during this period as well.  With the release of \\"Crest\\" the band actually received praise from the critics and two songs, \\"Steel Monkey\\" and \\"Farm On The Freeway\\" were actually heard quite a bit on AOR radio.  The \\"band\\" by this point had been reduced down to just Ian Anderson, Martin Barre and Dave Pegg.  This album rocks in places and simmers in a cool mellow way in others.  There is very little of the band's folk-ish sound to be found here, and the album was very modern sounding for it's time.  The opener \\"Steel Monkey\\" almost sounds like 80's era ZZ Top.  Martin Barre has some great stuff here and I think this is one of his best albums.   There are some great songs on this disc especially \\"Farm On The Freeway\\", \\"Budapest\\", Mountain Men\\", and the sexual double meaning \\"Raising Steam\\".  The only negative thing really is that by this time Anderson's voice was continuing to deteriorate, but for the most part things are notched down a peg and he sounds good here.  Although different from their earlier works I have always really like this album and thought that it was a nice return to form for the band at the time of it's release.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Absolutely ghastly. So bad - if I were a werewolf - I'd be hacking hairballs for days on end. I wanted to like this movie - I really did - because I think Hugh Jackman is a wonderful actor - but even Jackman - talented as he is - can't save this mess. It looks like the director was writing the script as he went - throwing ever black and white monster movie, and Hammer House of Horror flick, at the wall just to see what would stick. Thus you have a convoluted plot involving Dracula, Werewolves and even Dr. Frankenstein's monster. <br /> <br />Some movies take a while to get going - I knew this one was going to stink up the joint within the first ten minutes - and I'm probably being generous there. This movie never gets going. There are idiotic plot lines involving Dracula getting it on with his undead brides - is anybody gagging yet. The undead brides look like a trio of jiggle queens - B rated porn stars who look like they are ready for a slumber party - and none of them can act - and really - Dracula and his brides making babies? So what, even undead women have biological clocks ticking away now? If I was Dracula's bride - I can think of much more entertaining ways to spend my immortality - than being pregnant with his undead kid. <br /> <br />So we see Van Helstink channeling Indiana Jones, swinging from ropes and crashing through windows. This movie is unintentionally funny - and even then not in a good way. Then he gets bit by a werewolf and we get to watch him morph- and even this was a collosal disappointment. Instead of employing make up, special effects, etc. and actually creating a realistic werewolf - they just used computers and puked up a CGI fight between an animated werewolf and an animated flying, dracula batlike - whatever. By the time the big smackdown between VanHelstink and Dracula was ready to begin I had completely zoned out of this movie.  <br /> <br />The only reason I even stuck around for the end was because I had already wasted the money -thank god it was at least matinee prices or else I would have really been disgusted. So the only thrill I got - all two seconds of it - was watching Hugh Jackman rip his shirt off and I like shirtless Hugh. Save your money - do not rent this, do not buy it. And the guy who wrote the script probably deserves a silver bullet AND a stake through the heart to make sure they never produce anything this bad again.  <br />
B00005JPAO|5.0|I have to admit I went into the theatre to watch this film somewhat reluctantly.  As a history teacher and history buff I am a fan of British history and I am a fan of tradition.  I had a feeling this film would try to tear down British royal tradition and would simply portray both the Royal family and the Queen in a negative light for their actions in the aftermath of the death of Diana.  I couldn't have been more wrong.   <br /> <br />After leaving the theater I was impressed not only with the plot, the characterization and the cinematography, but I was impressed with Helen's performance.  Having been a fan of her work since Excalibur, I knew she had a great deal of talent.  However, in this film she took the performance to another level.  Oscar winning performance indeed!  She looked like the queen, she sounded like the queen, she transformed herself INTO the queen.   <br /> <br />The story itself was well written and did a good job of presenting both sides of the issue:  it presented the Queen's side, which is that Diana was no longer a royal and therefor should not receive the \\"Royal\\" treatment.  It also presented the side of Tony Blair and the English people.  In essence this film is exploring the paradox of an ancient monarch living in the modern world.  While Elizabeth herself is NOT ancient, the monarchy itself, as an institution, is itself ancient.   <br /> <br />The best part of this film, as other reviewers have noted, is the fact it lets the viewer come to his/her own decision on the events and whether or not the Queen did the right thing.  You can not go wrong by adding this film to your collection.

B000PFUAO6|5.0|So anyone who says Dream Theater doles out the same stuff repeatedly are nuts. Octavarium was not a good album. There was nothing on that album that blew me away and there was a song that seriously could have been considered a product of Muse. With that said, Systematic Chaos is a huge upgrade from Octavarium. It's sharp, sophisticated and heavy. The album begins with a bang. In the Presence of Enemies Part 1 is absolutely sick for the first 5 instrumental minutes and LaBrie singing isn't half bad. However, my biggest gripe about this album is in fact James LaBrie. Anyone who criticizes Myung, Portnoy, Rudess, and/or Petrucci for creating a bad album should reevaluate. Those four are world-class musicians put hours into their work and do everything in their power to deliver new music that will please their fans. Overall, they accomplished their goal of innovation. Sure, there are certainly similarities between Systematic Chaos and their previous albums (which a lot of people have described as unoriginal) but come on! Ever heard of style trademarks? I mean I feel like no one will ever be happy with Dream Theater; every time they try something new, they criticized for not going back to their old ways, and when they produce something more in-tuned with their earlier stuff (like Systematic Chaos), they get shot down. How many bands today do people know of that have been around as long as DT? I mean come on, these guys tour constantly and are truly passionate about music. As much as I love this band, there is one common criticism I will agree with, however, and it is the fact that James LaBrie is their singer. He really isn't very good. His range is limited and he goes over the top unnecessarily at times. He doesn't contribute much in the writing process and is nowhere near the caliber of the other DT members. Honestly, if DT finally wised up and replaced LaBrie with an edgier, more talented singer (like for instance, the lead singer of Symphony X), they would be sooo much better off; LaBrie is holding them back. I mean don't get me wrong, LaBrie, within his own limitations, can deliver. In fact, I liked him a lot on the song \\"Repentance,\\" but he was terrible on the song, \\"The Dark Eternal Night.\\" Actually, DT does not even need a singer! I realized after listening to Systematic Chaos that I listen for the incredible instrumentation, not the lyrics and/or singing. To me, the players (Myung, Portnoy, Petrucci, and Rudess) are what makes the band so special and define Dream Theater.
0151013047|5.0|Mohsin Hamid writes so well that were it not for the propulsive force of his quietly building suspense story, the reader would be tempted to linger over passages of elegantly beautiful prose.  THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST is a timely book, yes, but it is far more: the novel underscores the talent of a superlative writer unafraid to place before the public a story that is bound to create a disturbing response at the end of the roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Cleverly written as a monologue from a Pakistani young man named Changez (a name when pronounced delivers major clues to the story!) as he joins an American in a cafe in Lahore, Pakistan. The story reveals a young lad from a family once well to do in Pakistan, but fractured by the political changes suffered by that country, a lad who goes to America to attend Princeton University where he transforms himself into an 'American stance', performs exceedingly well academically, and joins the wealthy American classmates on jaunts where he encounters the beautiful but mysteriously aloof Erica.  Changez and Erica become friends and were it not for Erica's recovering from a loss of her previous lover Chris who died of cancer, the two seem to be destined to become lovers.  Erica is from a wealthy family who accepts Changez even more readily when upon graduation he is awarded a position with the prestigious firm Underwood Samson. Changez learns the feeling of the American preoccupation with success and wealth while still being committed to his family ties in Pakistan.  While Changez is on a business trip to Manila he watches the 9/11 event and he is surprised that he feels a bit happy that haughty America is being brought to her feet.<br /><br />Changez returns home finding his physical appearance now a cause for suspicion in the bruised country that afforded him success.  He attempts to stay connected with Erica but Erica has retreated into her fragile state of melancholia and is eventually hospitalized. Changez continues his successful climb up the American dream ladder of success until he meets a gentleman Juan-Bautista in Chile who admonishes him that his devotion to his work for American companies might force him to forget the importance of home and family.  Changez is changed and his decision regarding his employment, his lack of knowledge of Erica's whereabouts, and his growing anger at America preemptive attacks on countries near his home - all result in his returning to Pakistan, and the encounter with the American at the cafe. And Hamid leaves us there, afloat on a sea of questions and new information about the people we have been attacking and the result is a pungent experience in re-thinking the global atmosphere.<br /><br />The book is relatively short (184 pages) and since it is written as one extended conversation, it is next to impossible not to read the entire book at one sitting: leaving the story even for a moment would be like leaving a personal encounter - rude.  The story is superb, written with facile elegance, and contains views from outside our cloistered world that refreshingly informs us to re-examine our point of view.

0143034545|5.0|I have not read Mr. Allen's \\"Getting Things Done,\\" but I'd like to read everything he's written now. I've read many time management books...and I've read many philosophy books. This is excellent in both spheres. The approach to time management is so much deeper than \\"List To-Do's and prioritize A-B-C\\"; it led me to think very deeply about time and perception, and what we do with our minds moment by moment. I love his concept of \\"psychic RAM\\" - and the idea that the more clogged it is, the less effective we are. This actually echoes Julia Cameron's practice of the \\"Morning Pages\\" in \\"The Artist's Way,\\" and Brenda Euland's idea that writing everything down, EVERYTHING, produces a clear, flowing stream of thought. When Mr. Allen talks about writing everything down, he is talking about much more than a to-do list. This is not the same old time management guru stuff.<br /><br />His style, too, is appealing. None of that bright, chirpy tone of many self-help books, and none of the \\"weightiness\\" of Steven Covey. You hear a real person talking.<br /><br />Finally, there are the sidebar quotes, which are extremely wide-ranging and well-chosen.
B000OVLBEO|2.0|I have never been a Nicholas Cage fan, but he stoops to new lows (even for him) on this abysmal comic book adaptation. The only reason I remember this movie from the theater is the point when he strips naked to reveal some killer abs, at which point everyone in the hall was really into the film for about two minutes.<br /><br />This film has everything going for it - great special effects, a villain with real power and charisma (in fact, he was the star of the show, for me), and a gorgeous heroine who should have been given more screentime. Why they chose the old and out of talent Nicholas Cage to headline this otherwise stellar enterprise is beyond me. I mean, the man has nothing. Virtually nothing at all. There is no screen presence here, no memorable dialogue, and he really looks like one of those 50+ men who inject themselves with botox and believe that they look 25 again. Seriously, it IS that bad - I dare you to watch it and say anything remotely positive about his disgusting performance in this film.<br /><br />Granted, a film of this sort is ludicrous, but when a TV show can get the premise better (\\"Supernatural\\" anyone?), its time to worry. I can say that the bike stunts were nice, and the 'head' effects were pretty stellar too. Its just that the romance is a bit convoluted even for a fantasy film of this sort, and lead actress Eva Mendes looks so detached and disinterested in her surroundings, its as if she belongs in some other film entirely. Now, this is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, but what happened to the hair and make-up here. Eva could have been presented so, so much better.<br /><br />The climax was great though - I always enjoy the concept of good vs. evil, and the storyline of selling your soul to the devil. This film captures that, but when compared to other films of a somewhat similar genre (such as the far superior and almost classic \\"Constantine\\"), it falters quite a bit. For that reason, this remains a novelty piece with very little repeat value. Well, maybe you'll watch it twice if you're into bikes, but beyond that, believe me, its a tiring exercise.<br /><br />Two Stars. Casting the overrated and useless Nicholas Cage in this ruined all their chances. I can imagine someone like James Franco (best actor in Hollywood right now, right after Leo) pulling this off. In fact, I spent half my time in the seat wondering how wonderful it would be if a certain scene had been given to James Franco instead - now THATS the \\"Ghost Rider\\" I want to see.<br /><br />Watch this if you want to watch an over-the-hill and hideous Nicholas Cage run around in tights like a little girl. If that sort of thing is your bag, grab this immediately. If its not, I suggest writing a letter to the studio protesting the ruin of an otherwise possibly excellent film.h very little repeat value.

0345494768|5.0|Making of Star Wars by J.W. Rinzler is truely a definitive account of how Star Wars was created. The book proves to be well written, superbly researched and the author obviously had the total cooperation from George Lucas. The material presented in this book proves to be a literal gold mine of information that easily surpassed any film documentary any reader may have seen on DVD or TV on this subject. The book is also blessed with many photographs, illustrations, draft notes and all that carefully traced the gradual, somewhat painful growth of the story, concepts and film making of the movie Star Wars. Now, some of the photos and illustrations have been seen before in other publications but this book gathered all into one tome and made it utterly interesting experience to go through them all. Some of the more exciting material of this book shows the evolution of the story of Star Wars and how George Lucas had to make many changes, committed many compromises, just to get the movie made.<br /><br />Along the way, there are host of tidbits information on all aspects of the making of the movie, many stories of how George Lucas got some of his ideas and concepts. The book traces the development of Star Wars from the initial concept of George Lucas all the way to the released of the movie and its consequence aftermath of total success. Its a complete story that will totally engross the reader may that reader be a fan or not.<br /><br />If I had any real gripe about this book, it may be that the story hung too tightly around George Lucas and even if he may have been the sun to the host of planets circling around him, maybe the author could have expanded a bit more in other directions. A good example would be that I thought the account of how the soundtrack of Star Wars was concieved to be weakly presented.<br /><br />But overall, this is one of the best \\"making of\\" books I ever read and even if the price range appears to be pretty steep, its a book well worth buying and reading. For any real Star Wars fan, money matter not when buying this book, its totally mandatory.and reading. For any real Star Wars fan, money matter not when buying this book, its totally mandatory.
B00006YXEK|5.0|This album is a must for all Harrison fans, and deserves a listen even by those who are not. His talent and spirituality are up front in the music and lyrics, which are mostly explorations of Harrison's feelings about life and God, with a few surprises in the form of more whimsical offerings like \\"The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\", and the bluesy \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\", which point to his versatility as an artist. The chant performed by Harrison and Dhani, his son, at the end of the title track is especially poignant. The album released posthumosly and finished by Jeff Lynne and Dhani is a testament to a musician and man who was much loved by his family, friends, and fans.

B000PTYP5C|3.0|I have to agree with the crowd that wasn't impressed with this album. I hear a lot of recycled material in this album, like, Glass Prison and Dance of Eternity, not to mention the Metallica St Anger and Iron Maiden references to the music and the odd timed signatures. Portnoy's voice seems to be overshadowing Labrie's, and the soloing is a bit out of control in places--revisiting the \\"let's see how fast we can play\\" routine can bore a first time listener. I was stuck asking when Labrie was going to start singing again. They have done this stuff already, I was hoping for something that was more evolutionary. Not another Octavarium, but certainly not rehashing of songs they have done already. There is something to be said for bands who release an album every three to four years--they take their time and get it where they find it acceptable. This one seems a bit rushed out to the market. Maybe in time this one will grow on me, but my overall first impression is that of disappointment. These guys are talented, I'll never take that away from them. But overdone solos and recycled music doesn't tickle my fancy.

0375500901|3.0|No spoilers <br /> <br />Um, maybe I didn't read the same book as everyone else, but I read a book called The Kill Artist and quite frankly, it was boring as hell. One reviewer said that if you are expecting an exciting pulse pounding spy novel, then don't read this. I should have listened.  <br /> <br />I was looking for a new thriller series to get into, and when I found Silva, I was pretty excited for it. Unfortunately, I will not be continuing. This book is not thrilling or pulse-pounding or anything close to that. You know how books are sometimes slow in the beginning to build up to the action? Well this whole book is that build up... but it builds up to nothing. One reviewer said that the most exciting thing the protagonist does is reset an alarm clock. As crazy as it sounds, he was right. The action in the book is almost exclusive flashbacks and you find yourself wishing something would happen in the present to keep your attention. <br /> <br />This book does earn a three star rating because of its information on the events and and different perspectives of the Arab-Israeli conflict in history. I like history, and because I'll admit that that subject is not something I know too much about, it was interesting to get the information Silva provides. Beyond that though, this book is no thriller and gets my 'skip' recommendation without much trepidation.

Every Nine Inch Nails album is as equally as great as the next.  Just listen more than once and you will see.  If you like Nails you should pick up this cd.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is further proof that hollywood doesn't have a clue what good entertainment is.

You want them to win, even when they are doing wrong. <br /> <br />The premise seems a little hard to swallow, a western in space, but Whedon's deft hand creates a perfect combination. Firefly is a Must See I am glad I purchased.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|When you think you've seen the best there is, it seems like something always comes along to top it. This is one of those things. <br /> <br />Everything about this series (except disc 5) is stunning---EVERYTHING. 'so much so that in several instances, you will find your jaw dropped without knowing it. <br /> <br />Now disc 5. I only made it through about ten minutes of it, but I can only assume that the whole thing is dedicated to telling me how precarious the whole planet is, and how it's ready to fall out of orbit unless WE ACT NOW to save it! If you're into that foolish hysteria, then it will be icing on the cake for an otherwise unbelievable set of DVDs. <br /> <br />I highly, HIGHLY recommend this set.
0895260131|5.0|Tony Blair said on one occasion that he had spent the weekend reading the Qur'an and that it was a good experience--the book was spiritually uplifting.  Well, he can't have read it very carefully.  Those who study this well researched book by Robert Spencer will discover that Islam's holy book and the religion deriving from it have many exceedingly negative characteristics.  Are Muslim terrorism, the repression of women in Islamic countries, and the horrific punishments carried out in Islamic states aberrational, or are they inherent products of that particular  religious system?  Find out in this badly needed book, which is far removed from cocktail-hour political correctness.
075640407X|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has writing a creative and engaging first novel.  It is the first in a three-part story about Kvothe, pronounced \\"quothe\\".  This first book is a coming-of-age story where young Kvothe starts out with his family, spends some time with a mentor, is separated from his family and has a hard time of it, and then goes to University and does well.  It is a bit more complicated than that.  We learn at the beginning that Kvothe is something of a celebrity, or perhaps a demon or even just a myth.  The real story of Kvothe is the central narrative, and it is fascinating, chilling, and funny, but never simple. <br /> <br />Kvothe is not some Prince in disguise.  He is of modest birth, but what sets him apart from others is his brain--he is brilliant and learns difficult subjects very easily.  He is also recklessly brave to the point of idiocy, insightful, and occasionally oblivious to the events surrounding him.  One of his greatest strategic blunders involves the gift of a candle, and he should of known better, but he was a bit doped up at the time.  His brilliance creates opportunities for him, but his recklessness often gets him into trouble.   <br /> <br />There are other characters in the book, including his parents, a mentor or two, some friends and a large herbivore that are painted in loving detail by the author.  There are many other minor characters that come and go.  Parts of the narrative are made up of people telling each other stories, and that nicely fills in background about this very complex world with multiple languages, drug addicts, scholars, magicians, and musicians.   <br /> <br />The magic in the book comes in two flavors: sympathy and naming.  The sympathy magic is very well thought out by the author, who has clearly had courses in physical sciences.  It is a refreshing change to have the characters worry about where all the energy goes when you cool a fire to put it out.  The author's description of laboratory work is much better than one usually finds in fantasy stories.  Sympathy magic is the day-to-day magic of the minor magicians, but it can accomplish a lot if one is clever.  Naming magic is the nuclear option.  It is very hard to do or to learn, and it is hard to control, but it is very powerful.  There is definitely a Zen-like approach to successful naming.   <br /> <br />There is romance in the story, but it does not follow the simple boy-gets-girl pattern.  The relationship is important but tentative, and feels more realistic than many fantasy romances. <br /> <br />The Name of the Wind is a thoughtful, engrossing and complex fantasy novel by a talented new author.  It may be the best SF book I have read this year and it is sure to win awards.  Pick it up and give it a try.
0765348276|3.0|After reading the cover of this book and some of the really favorable Amazon reviews, I thought this book was going to be a great novel in the tradition of Starship Troopers (and other great works by Heinlein).  Alas, I was sadly disappointed.  The influence of Heinlein to the storyline is quite obvious, but this book falls well short of the best works of the master.  It is really a pretty standand military sci-fi novel in spite of the hype.<br /><br />The plotline is relatively simple.  Old men and women are given the chance to exchange their worn out bodies for young, strong genetically modified bodies so they can be foot soldiers in a series of intergalactic wars and skirmishes.  Humanity is only one of many races that are competing for habitable planets and resources, and the fighting against alien races requires soldiers with a lifetime of experience in genetically modified superhuman bodies.<br /><br />The book is broken up into three sections.  In the first, the 75 year old protagonist has volunteered for military service, but he (and we) slowly learn what this really entails.  This is the best part of the book and held my interest.  What does this military service really mean?  In the second section, the protagonist goes to basic training.  This is the most Heinlein-like part of the book, but carries absolutely none of the timeless quality of Juan Rico going through basic.  Scalzi tries to create the tough drill sergeant thing, but it turns out to be pretty shallow.  The interaction between Rico and Sgt. Zim in Starship Troopers is still relevant today to young men and women joining the military.  The third part of the book is a conventional military bug hunt and is not particularly imaginative or memorable.<br /><br />Two additional things really bugged me about this novel.  One of the central plot threads to the story is the fact that 75 year olds are taken into military service because their life experience is necessary/valuable to fight the wars.  This life experience is never important in resolving any conflicts.  The protagonist could have been a 17 year old, there was no problem that required a man or women's lifetime experience to resolve.  Second, I didn't like the whole idea of genetically modified bodies.  This plot line (at least the way it was developed b Scalzi) makes the soldier into superheros.<br /><br />This is a short, easy to read military sci-fi tale and is certainly worth a look for anyone interested in this genre.  Just don't expect something on the level of Starship Troopers because it isn't close.This life experience is never important in resolving any conflicts.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is one of those albums you are always searching for - one you want to play often both loud and not so loud.  It ticks all the boxes - great artists, good raunchy bluesy songs, + a dvd.  Glad I have it.

I esp love Superconductor, Anagram (for Mongo) [Candygram for Mongo] and Presto!   <br /> <br />Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed and maybe you'll become a RUSH for life too.

This series shows the pioneering spirit that made our country great.
0307277887|2.0|This book is interesting, and well-written, and a pleasure to read.  Dexter's POV perspective is engaging, thought-provoking, and amazingly believeable.  That being said... the plot of this book is like it was written by Charlie Kaufman's fake twin brother from Adaptation, for god's sake.  Anyone who's ever watched an episode of a mystery show or read a single mystery book will see the end of this a million miles away, and groan.  If someone came up to you on the street and held a gun to your head, and asked you for the plot of this book based on this premise, this is what you'd blurt out.  I hope the second one has a better plot - otherwise, these just are just clever gimmicks without much substance or subtext.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|Well, yeah.  To be quite honest, this is a \\"middle-of-the-pack\\" effort from the progressive giants, Dream Theater.  To me, this is what Octavarium probably should have been...  For some reason, I keep disliking the middle of the last three Dream Theater CDs, with VERY few exceptions.  For example, in Train of Thought, it started out strongly with As I Am, This Dying Soul, and Endless Sacrifice, and then, what the hell was Honor Thy Father and Vacant?  Then we get Octavarium, and it seemed like every OTHER song was good...  The Answer Lies Within, I Walk Beside You, Never Enough, and Sacrificed Sons?  What the hell was that.  And then, there's this... <br /> <br />In The Presence of Enemies Pt. 1 starts the album off just the way I wanted to hear this album start off.  Progressive-mania!  The lyrical portion is also well-sung, with a nice pseudo-heavy rhythm, already promising to be a very good album.   <br /> <br />Forsaken is a GOOD song.  As far as straight-up uber-ballads go, I'd dare say it's the best I've heard since The Spirit Carries On.  But, it's a cheesy vampiric song ala The Spill Canvas' \\"This Is For Keeps.\\"  But, it's catchy, and it has good riffage, so I'll forgive John Petrucci, as his lyrics are usually decent. <br /> <br />Constant Motion...  Honestly, I can do without the Metallica \\"Blackened\\" rip-off, for what, the second time in recent memory (This Dying Soul).  The instrumental section in the song saves its dignity, but, stop with the Metallica references.  We know you guys liked their hey-day, we know you were influenced from them, for the love of God move on. <br /> <br />The Dark Eternal Night... Again, another waste of a song minus the instrumental section.  I respect your effort of trying to use some different sounds in your music, and it was a cool experiment to double up with Mike Portnoy on the vocals, but, until the instrumental, it's boring, and damn near annoying. <br /> <br />Repentance...  Great song, then again, I\\"m a huge fan of melancholy music nowadays.  I think it's a worthy addition to the AA saga, and I think it was the right move to make a much more down-tempo addition, as the other three were uber-heavy.   <br /> <br />Prophets of War...  James, stop writing protest songs.  Thanks.  I like the Muse, there's only one of them.  I prefer you guys to be Dream Theater.  I haven't seen a good lyric from you since Disappear, and I'm anxiously awaiting one. <br /> <br />The Ministry of Dark Souls...  Most people will probably say the In The Presence of Enemies would win the \\"OMG BEST SONG ON THE CD\\" award, but I disagree.  I think this song would make top 5 songs from them of all time.  7+ minutes of beautiful melody, and vocals, followed up by a maelstrom of incredulous soloing, and I actually don't find it to be over-the-top in the least.   <br /> <br />In the Presence of Enemies Pt. 2...  A great ending to a good/very good Dream Theater effort.    3.9/5
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Simply stunning. After years of watching the wonderful natural history programming the BBC produces, I was expecting more of the same. This surpasses anything done in years past by a significant margin. If you have a Blu-Ray player and you have children, this is a must. My kids have watched these shows repeatedly since we received them, prefering them over a number of recently released animated movies.
B000002JKA|4.0|If you're new to Dream Theater, I don't really suggest you start out with this album, because, a lot of it is an acquired taste, much like Guinness Beer...  Some parts are bitter and self-indulgent (*ahem* LaBrie *ahem*).  But let's not pretend that this album isn't great, because it is great, and deserves that praise, but there are obvious weaknesses, but, I'll get into that with the song-by-song... <br /> <br />6:00 ... Starts out with some cool drumming from Portnoy, and a background vocal repeatedly saying \\"six o'clock on a Christmas morning\\", which if I was to indulge into my own assumptions, is about Kevin Moore's disgust with being away from his family, and his ambivalence towards leaving Dream Theater, of which we know the result of.  Anyways, LaBrie's vocals seem a bit less polished this time around, with a more raw, scream to them, which I'm not huge on, but, it's an OK opener to the album. <br /> <br />Caught in a Web ... Other than a really good instrumental section, the rest of the song is boring to me, and even after listening to this CD hundreds of times, I still can't fully get into this song.  Although to be positive, this is one of the few tracks where I actually like LaBrie's vocals.  All-in-all, tolerable, but not all that great <br /> <br />Innocence Faded ... This is probably the first song I truly loved on this album.  LaBrie's incredibly self-indulgent vocals do drag it down a bit, particularly in the 2nd verse, to where he's nearly impossible to decipher.  The instrumental in the last 1:45 of the song is quite legendary in my opinion though so, there you go. <br /> <br />Erotomania ... Great instrumental, and definitely one of the strongest points of the album.  Great keyboarding by Kevin Moore throughout, and great guitar work by John Petrucci. <br /> <br />Voices ... The second part of \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\".  It's an excellent song, despite LaBrie's vocal vomiting in parts of it.  The instrumental/solo is tasty, and the lyrics are mind-boggling cryptic, shrouded in religious jargon, but, all-in-all excellently written in all aspects. <br /> <br />The Silent Man ... Straight up acoustic number, and a decent end to the three-parter.  Good enough for what it is, I suppose. <br /> <br />The Mirror ... This is where it starts to lose some of its grip for me, not that I don't like Petrucci's crushing riffs.  This is kind of Portnoy's debut into being part of DT's lyricist family, and I already didn't particularly like his stylings.  Not my first choice to listen to when I think of Dream Theater, but, alright, I'll take it <br /> <br />Lie ... A decent song.  Nothing special about it really, although I love the flow of the vocals in the verses.   <br /> <br />Lifting Shadows Off a Dream ... It's ethereal and majestic enough to make it a great ballad from John Myung. <br /> <br />Scarred ... Hands down, the best song on the CD.  It starts out almost like a jazz song, and segues into one of the best Petrucci solos.  Awesomeness in all eleven minutes of it. <br /> <br />Space Dye Vest ... And how fitting they follow the best song of the CD with their best ballad to date.  The whole lyric is just incredible, and to think, it's simply about turning the page in a magazine...  A wonderful end of Awake, and the Kevin Moore-era of DT. <br /> <br />4.4/5

B000002MG1|5.0|Automatic For The People is REM's 1993 album released as follow up to the successful Out Of Time. The album is unique in REM's discography in that it relies heavily on string arrangements, which gives the album a nice,  cozy, and sentimental feel. <br /> <br />The albums kicks off with the outstanding Drive before driving us through 11 tracks of pure excellence that includes the brilliant Try Not To Breathe and The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite, the heartbreaking hit single Everybody Hurts (a song once dedicated to the late Nirvana frontman, and Michael Stipe's friend Kurt Cobain), the politically charged Ignoreland, the elusive Sweetness Follows and Star Me Kitten, the Andy Kaufman ode and hit single Man On The Moon (the song that would eventually become the foundation for a movie of the same title in 1999 starring Jim Carrey as Kaufman), the ethereal Nightswimming, and the folksy album closer Find The River. <br /> <br />REM went on to release other powerful albums in the years that followed Automatic, most notably Monster, but Automatic stands out as an album that really pulled me in, and made me appreciate REM to this day.  <br /> <br />One of the greatest albums ever released! <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A <br /> <br />

B000MR9D5E|5.0|In the ecologically devastated and oppressively overpopulated Earth of the future as depicted in the '70s SciFi classic, Soylent Green, suicide is encouraged, enabled and rewarded by the state.  Citizens who volunteer to check out are given something akin to Jonestown Kool-Aid for a night cap and then while they slip gently into the Big Sleep, they are treated to a montage of achingly beautiful scenes of nature and wildlife, reminiscent of Earth as it was before it succumbed to the ravages of pollution and overpopulation.  These sweeping panoramas play out on a floor-to-ceiling wraparound screen in the sayonara suite accompanied by the symphonic strains of Beethoven; the Pastoral, I believe.  Anyway, the the whole experience is so rapturous to behold for these departing souls -- especially compared to the wretched reality of the world they are exiting -- that it's easy to believe that, for them, it is an experience worth dying for. <br /> <br />Well, the hours upon hours of ravishing footage in Planet Earth is even better than what was featured in Soylent Green's death theater.  And best of all, you won't have to die to see it.  On the contrary, if you're as starved for natural beauty as most city folks, this splendid series will intoxicate your eyes and nourish your soul.  This is what should have gone out on the Voyager disk as a love poem from Earth.  It's that good.
B00007JMCX|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  David Bowie, Candy Clark, Rip Torn & Buck Henry are sensational.  This movie requires multiple viewings to catch the whole story and subtle details.  The bonus features disc is really not necessary (and short) unless you're really into knowing everything about a movie and it's principals.  If you like to think about and discuss a movie with friends, this is definitely the one.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|WARNING: PLOT SPOILER! <br /> <br />With all due respect, Amazon customers are not reviewing this movie correctly. You need to understand what it is, how it was made, and the reason for what you're complaining about. <br /> <br />Let's start WAY back. Richard Donner was filming Superman: The Movie and Superman II at the same time. For example, if they had Gene Hackman, they'd film a Lex Luthor scene from I and then II. However, as the the release date for I drew near, the crew decided to temporaily stop production on II to finish I by Christmas. The movie, as many know, was a huge success.  <br /> <br />When production on II was stopped, Donner had finished filming every Marlon Brando scene, every Hackman scene, the begining, and the ending. The Salkinds, the producers of the Christopher Reeve Superman series, decided to fire Donner for many reasons. First off is that Brando was demanding much more money for his footage than the first time. The Salkinds didn't want to pay it. Donner said that we do the movie right, or we don't do it all. And then Donner was fired, all because the Salkinds wanted to save a few thousand dollars, which they wouldn't even noticed they lost if they let Donner finish the film.  <br /> <br />Richard Lester was hired to finish Superman II. He is the man who directed the version we've been viewing for years. Lester re-shot many of Donner scenes, not because he had to, but if he directed at least 51% of the film , then he could be credited as the \\"official\\" director. Scenes that were kept were only Luthor scenes and some \\"fillers\\" that didn't need to be re-shot since Lester had 51% of the footage that would be used with his name on it. When people watch Lester's version of II, and especially III since Donner had not part in creating it, that he doesn't have the \\"comic book\\" spirit. <br /> <br />When I watch Superman II, as with other people, I always have so many questions. (Not anymore.) I also notice so many inconsistentsies. Many people who watched II before they knew the Donner story think the following things: how does Superman get his power back in the end? What happened to Superman's father? (Why is his mother suddenly at the Fortress of Salitude?)They also notice how Clark Kent's glasses color change, and how there is sometimes a huge age diference that is noticable in Superman and Lois in a few scenes. It is obvious now that Superman's father is not there due to Brando was too expensive for the cheap Salkinds, Superman got his power back from a scene that was shot with Brando which the plot couldn't allow his mother to replace him, and that all the inconsistenites and age differences are from going to Lester footage to Donner footage.  <br /> <br />Ok, now for the part you've been waiting for... <br /> <br />Superman II- The Richard Donner Cut was released in 2006. (You think it has anything to do with the release of Superman Returns? Oh yeah, by the way, GREAT MOVIE! See my review there!)Experts found all of his footage in England. As you recall from the begining, Donner never finished the movie. Therefore, in this cut, Lester footage was used occasionally to keep the story going. Since Lester footage was from a movie with a slightly different plot, it doesn't fit in perfectly, but there is no other option. When everyone says that they like Lester one-liners better than Donner one-liners, for examples, \\"General, would you care to step outside?\\" to \\"General? Haven't you heard of freedom of the press?\\", they must remember it's not about creating a movie that will be a box office hit. It's about creating a movie that shows Donner footage. And when a scene that Donner shot it also avaible in a slightly different Lester version, the Donner version will be shown. (Remember: in the rare case that Lester has better footage, he got to do it after Donner filmed his cut!) <br /> <br />And now, the ending. Yes, VERY dissapointing. Superman I had such a great ending that wasn't anticipated, and we waited for the same type of thing. And we got the same thing: the EXACT SAME ENDING shown on the EXACT SAME FOOTAGE! Let me ask you something, do you think Donner said \\" I'm going to make two dramatic movies and then end them the same way?\\" No! When Donner shot the ending of Superman turning the world back, he didn't know what movie to use it on. When the pressure for I came, he decided to use it and would film an ending for II later, which he NEVER GOT TO DO! So at that point, it's either Donner's ending, or Lester's magic kiss of memory loss. Since it is called Superman II- The Richard Donner Cut, I think you know which one was used.  <br /> <br />So there you have it. I got a kick out of seeing this since all of the questions I had that were never answered were answered. If you are looking for entertainment, rent it because this movie wasn't designed for that. This isn't Superman: The Movie or Superman Returns; it's a work-in-progress that's not in progress anymore. If you are a Superman fan, not only will you love it, but you'll want to keep this and add it to your Superman DVD stash.

B000N3ST9I|4.0|While many hailed 2004's \\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\" as Machine Head's return to form, I disagreed, even though it was a solid album nevertheless.  \\"The Blackening\\" is a real return to form for the veteran thrashers, who to say have rebounded nicely after the disaster that was \\"Supercharger\\" is saying it lightly.  This is undoubtedly the closest the band has come to emulating the sound from their classic debut \\"Burn My Eyes\\" (produced by Colin Richardson, who the band is re-united with here), which makes it worth checking out alone.  Opening track \\"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\\" is by far the heaviest opening track Machine Head has crafted in years, and sounds like a new age \\"Davidian\\", and is worth the price of admission alone.  \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\", \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\", and the closing \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" are all excellent tracks that proudly mark the return of Machine Head to the real metal world as vocalist/guitarist Robb Flynn growls, Dave McClain pounds the skins as if his life depends on it, and Phil Demmel provides the best guitar work the band has seen since the days of founding member Logan Madder.  Though it is ultimately too short in it's running time, \\"The Blackening\\" is nevertheless a great metal album and a welcome return to form for Machine Head, and here's hoping that this time around the band avoids the stumbling blocks and is finally back on track.

B00000E01M|5.0|Anthony Newman, Parisian student, brilliant as always, Applying an accomplish technique brings us original Scarlaty music.    This is so delicate literature that hardly any known style and technique applies to good interpretation. For example, Pletnev and other great pianists better hold back their \\"romantic\\" approach to Scarlatti, though I find interesting Pletnev selection of 32 sonatas . Then there is Kipnis who makes these sonatas piquant and a little shallow,thought I like that to. However, the real Scarlatti is neither romantic, sweet nor piquant and playful. Scarlatti sonatas are peculiar and sometimes rich in dreadful ambience, built dressed in ornamentations and various embelishments. This music depicts Scarlati's personal imprisonment and serviltude at the Royalty of the King of Spain. Anthony Newman brings Royal music to Royal instrument, three stories cembalo specially made for this occasion. He carefuly empasizes even the smallest details which makes this a glorious performance in all aspect.     Since I am not a musician,I am lacking tolls to describe this superior interpretation, but I am aware that this should be definite Scarlatti, not only for me, but for the broad audience as well. In terms of Anthony's \\"sewing- machine\\", one who find it inappropriate, should listen to Pierre Hantai to see the real dark side of Scarlatti sonatas. It is a dread horror that curdle the blood and is based on one of a kind virtuosity and intelligence of  Pierre Hantai. I suggest that interpretation too.       Mirro

Gore is the chief priest of The New Enviromentalists, who believe that the present-day activities of Americans are the sole cause of global warming (why is it that I mentally hear those last two words in Gore's voice?), and Everybody Knows This because (all together now) \\"I HATE GEORGE BUSH\\". Then they drive away in their Lexus or Volvo SUVs, which are safe enough because neither is a product of American industry, and as such are not harmful to the environment. Don't get me started.<br /><br />What this story has to do with that is that scientists have found that \\"polar shift\\" occurs naturally every few eons or so, and that runs counter to New Environmental belief that modern man is the one and only potential cause of profound climatic change. All that the Bad Guys in this story are doing is artificially trying to trigger something that's going to happen anyway in several millennia.<br /><br />It's taken me a while to get used to this Next Generation NUMA series, but Cussler's basic premise is that Dirk Pitt would age in the real world and he does not want to handle his work in the same way that creators of James Bond fiction keep 007 young forever. Otherwise, a forever-young Superman would by now be visting Lois Lane in a senior care facility, Inspector Henderson would by now be deceased after retirng as Chief of the Metropolis Police, and Jimmy Olsen would be about ready to throw in his papers as longtime editor of the Daily Planet. After all, a lot of miles have rolled by on the old NUMA odometer since Pitt raised the Titanic. It's a lot more valid than relying entirely on passing the torch to Dirk Pitt jr. and his Baywatch Babe of a sister Summer. In fact, the inclusion of Paul Kemprecos as Cussler's writing partner has given NUMA fiction a Bond-flick-in-print feel, with lots of action and vehicular pursuit scenes. There's even a scene where Austin touches base with his boss Dirk and borrows one of his famous antique cars for the best chase scene. Give it a try, and then you might want to go back and catch up on the earlier five volumes.ise, a forever-young Superman would by now be visting Lois Lane in a senior care facility, Inspector Henderson would by now be deceased after retirng as Chief of the Metropolis Police, and Jimmy Olsen would be about ready to throw in his papers as longtime editor of the Daily Planet.

032147404X|5.0|I bought this book for quick tips for improving my photography.  He provides you with concise practical information for those not interested in reading pages and pages of detail.  For instance, he states you can take pictures of flowers as if they were outside with the morning dew by purchasing them from the store and using a spray water bottle.  I followed that tip and spent 4 hours photographing my flowers.  That is simple and practical but I would've never thought of it.  His ability to provide tips on a variety of subjects was impressive. <br /> <br />I give him five stars for sharing the methods used to take some of his more creative shots.  Some photographers provide \\"breathtaking\\" photos but do not dare to give you any real insight as to the time or the method used to capture the moment.  He provides that information. <br /> <br />His jokes are very cheesy but I appreciate his attempt not to take himself too seriously although he is serious about his work.

B00005JPLW|5.0|One of the top three movies of allllll time.  Yes its that good, it makes you want to jump out of your seat, grab a shield and a spear, and win the fight yourself.

1594489505|5.0|Do not be deceived by the initial scene-setting story-telling (in Hosseini's incomparable style). I was thinking \\"Oh dear, this is interesting, but his second book just doesn't have the impact of his first\\" ...  <br /> <br />Until, once he brings the plot elements together, the suspense makes it almost impossible to put this book down; the horror of it makes it almost impossible not to. <br /> <br />This is a just a brilliant follow-on to Kite Runner. Khaled Hosseini is one of the most remarkable talents of our day; watch him on C-Span's BookTV or the Amazon video clips to get a sense of the man -- he is the genuine article, in terms of both his writing talent, and his personal world view. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. As much as it is the story of Afghanistan, it is also a more universal story of war and repressed society, which I'm sure will put his books into the \\"classic\\" category. Immensely compelling, deeply affecting! Bravo, and bravo again!
1401207138|5.0|I used to be big into comic books when I was a kid, then I saw that this graphic novel made the \\"top 100 novels of the 20th century\\" I decided to check it out.  The story was awesome, the art was good but felt dated.  I heard they're currently working on a movie version, I can't see how you could possibly capture the same feeling in a movie.  In all - awesome read whether or not you're into comic books or graphic novels.
B00005NTJK|5.0|The record like its predecessor \\"Stand Up\\" is full of great songs.  It takes a move up in terms of sound quality, though the production is somewhat idiosynchratic and annoyingly trebly at times. <br /> <br />The band and production infuse the material with fine energy and nice instrumental flourishes.  Lots of great stuff here but to me the best track of all is and has been \\"For Michael Collins, Jeffrey, and Me\\" - awesome.
B00006V9A0|1.0|I can't help but imagine the anger and hatred Kurt himself would've felt about this compilation. The reasons are blatantly obvious.
B00000GAIW|5.0|In retrospect, the masses are right.  This is Jethro Tull's finest moment.  The music has a real sense of immediacy and even urgency to it.  At a point in his life that Ian Anderson was writing his best songs, he took on a giant-sized and very unusual topic - the asinine nature of the religious beliefs that most humans have and persist in. <br /> <br />It's a BIG album.  And most of the songs on it are really quite great.  My kudos to Mr. Anderson for his level of ambition.  Glad it paid off. <br /> <br />I read complaints below about the fidelity on this issue, but it sounds just like the vinyl did back in the day - I suspect it's not possible to improve the sound, that's all there is.  Anderson's liner notes refer to them having a heck of a time getting clarity and cleanliness at the studio they recorded this in. <br /> <br />\\"Wind Up\\" is a great, underheard song.  \\"My God\\" is another great one.  \\"Hymn 43\\" I sing in the shower all the time, it's a great blues screamer guaranteed to get a reaction from others.  \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" and the title track are fine stuff.  Youthful anger and questioning here were focused here into something timeless. <br />  <br />
B0000024T3|5.0|This album was something I'll always remember--I was getting ready to go into the service and the album had just come out.  After arriving in Viet Nam my parents sent it to me on 8 track and I wore it out.  A couple of years ago a friend got in touch with me and talked of old times and he said one of the things he enjoyed the most was listening to all the music we had played.  He purchased the cd a couple of years ago and said he and his wife play it all the time-----he hadn't realized, at the time, what a great singer she was!
B00006JKOL|4.0|Side 1 of this is fairly sad.  The title track is okay - nothing great, but it manages a Zeppelin-like swagger.  The following 2 songs sound like parody though, particularly \\"Black Satin Dancer\\" with its riff stolen from Santana floating around in it. <br /> <br />Side 2 though, less bombastic and more acoustic (with arrangements) is good stuff and \\"Baker Street Muse\\" reminds you that Anderson was a songwriter of real talent, he really did some great work and this is some of it. <br />
B000000WGL|3.0|This might be a five-star Keith Richards' solo effort, but it is not a classic album by any means. What this album seems to miss most of all is Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts. Many folks believe that the absence of Jagger is a positive but I totally disagree. The Rolling Stones were a band, not the Keef project. As much as I believe that a strong case can be made for Richards' as the most influential guitarist in all of rock, in order for the Stones to be the greatest rock and roll band ever, they needed the unique jazzy chops of Watts and the inimitable Mick Jagger. It's naive to think that Keith wrote all the music and Jagger merely came up with lyrics. For anyone who knows a little history, even Keith admits that he didn't provide the music for all the hits (nor, for that matter, did Jagger write all the words).<br /><br />That being said, this is a highly enjoyable album with a very loose, funky, vibe to accompany the expected riff and roll that comes from Richards. An entire recording with Keith's vocals, however, only shows one way in which Jagger is missed. Additionally, there isn't much of interest lyrically. The strongest lyrics are those that speak of the fractured relationship the Glimmer Twins had at this point and they are typical Keith - blunt and to the point.<br /><br />Don't delude yourself into thinking that this is the lost Stones classic so many have been pining for - it is not. It is a fun party record that will move your body and bring a smile to your face.
B00005NTJM|3.0|Ian Anderson's songwriting grew by leaps and bounds after this record ... the songs on this one mostly lie kind of flat.  By his account, he feels he was a bit constrained until the personnel changes that took place after this record. <br /> <br />The music's okay, period stuff, nothing special.  \\"A Song For Jeffrey\\" and \\"Cat's Squirrel\\" have the most traction. <br />
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Fantastic series, worthwhile investing in a HD DVD/ HD TV setup just to watch it. The biggest bonus is that it has David Attenborough's commentary - Sorry Ms. Weaver, but I was bought up listening to Sir David's dulcet tones on wildlife programs and no one else can cut it. I really have no idea why BBC/Discovery felt they needed to spend the money and have someone else do the US series commentary.
0761129235|5.0|This little book changed my life -- Didn't know it at the time of purhase, but I felt scattered and ineffective in both my business and personal life.  Have been an artist for 40 years -- and it was time for me to do an unflinching life review.  I cleaned out my closets and began taking my first small steps toward my vision (plan) of what I wanted my best life to look like; I can honestly say these principles have resulted in BIG CHANGES!  I am more grounded, my business life is far more successful and I have a new found independence  -- who sez old artists can't change?
0143038419|5.0|In \\"EAT,PRAY,LOVE\\",Gilbert exhibits wisdom beyond her stated years. The work about her life and travels is both funny and powerful. Her journey to liberation from the expected and her individuation through pain and joy are inspiring. Young readers can learn from her courage, and the \\"not so young\\"can revisit their struggles in learning to experience joy, to grow spirtually, and to give fully in loving.
1591841666|5.0|Almost didn't buy this book --just finished my first read, now I am a total convert and will begin rereading it to reinforce this valuable information.  Not only did Seth Godin explain the value of the \\"Dips\\" in my art life, but concisely and precisely he describes what is a cul-de-sac -- a dead end.  I found that I needed to update my thinking and doing. I love the author's hard-nosed look at life -- his advice is based on rock solid principles and ideas. His other book \\"Small is the New Big\\" is also a must-read for anyone who needs to adjust to the unlimited potential of life in the age of the world-wide web.
0767817664|4.0|Ol' Charlie has a new neighbor and he turns out to be a blood sucking monster. No one believes Charlie. Not his mother, the police, or his girlfriend. They all believe he is crazy. If only they were right.<br /><br />This is a horror classic from the mind of Tom Holland (Child's Play). If you've never seen this 80s incarnation of vampire cinema then you've been deprived. Before Vamp and the Lost Boys was the original horror comedy involving teens and the undead.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I am almost heaving a sigh of relief as I write this review about Dream Theater's latest offering, Systematic Chaos. I picked it up the day it hit stores (June 5th). I was half praying that it wouldnt be the subdued experimentation that I'd seen with Octavarium (which by the way is the one DT album I rarely listen to). And I was NOT disappointed at all. Systematic Chaos comes packed with all the chops, time changes, apocalyptic riffs, sweeping melodies and all the ingredients that true DT fans love about this band. \\"In the Presence of Enemies Part 1\\" the first of their two part epic song of this album has a 5 minute intro showcasing DT at it's finest. The time changes are fast and furious (quite like Images and Words) and Labrie doesn't jump in until almost half the song. (Personally I've never been too much of a fan of Labrie's vocals but he's done well this time). Forsaken (one of my two favorite songs in the album) brings the power ballad back to DT's repertoire!! Labrie is brilliant and the orchestration of the song is absolutely superb. I love the arrangement on this song. Constant Motion (which was released as a single) is a heavy song.. again as classic DT written all over it - though it isnt my favorite DT song , I really think it is up there in terms of the instrumentation - with Petrucci and Rudess trading solos in what has become quite their trademark. And then is \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\". This is my second favorite song of this album. I have never heard such detuned bass play from Myung and if you love monster riffs, you're going to straight up love this song. It has some of the heaviest riffs I have heard and some tremendous shredding by Petrucci..an amazing song. \\"Repentance\\" is the 8th and 9th step in the \\"12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous\\" series that started with the Glass Prison in 6DOIT..it is my least favorite of the songs in this album..kind of mellow and subdued, not in keeping with the strong sounds of the rest of the album. \\"Prophets of War\\" kicks things back up, almost has a techno feel to it in the beginning..but is a great song nevertheless. It features the fan chant (where 50 lucky DT fans got immortalized in prog history). After that is  \\"Ministry of Lost Souls\\" - which again is in classic DT epic.. and at the end is Part 2 of \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" - which caps off the album in signature DT flourish. All in all, the album has all the essential components of a great DT record and will not disappoint at all.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I was a fan of Evanescence's first album and when I heard their single \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" I had to purchase this one. Overall it is a competent piece of music. The first time through I was entranced, yet the more I listened to it the less of a hold it held on me. Overall, only tracks 2 and 7 really stand on their own. The rest of the album, without the supporting tracks to segue into and prop them up, fail as individual efforts. If ever there was an ensemble album where it is the whole rather than the individual parts which make it work this is it.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|I had ordered this because I have a love for the Final Fantasy Series especially FFVII. This is a well recommended exition and it's price is not that bad at all. If you want an edition to your Final Fantasy collection especially if you are FFVII fan this is well worth the buy.    You get:  The movie itself with more languages and subtitles  You get a special 15 minute anime \\"Last Order\\" which tells of Zack and Cloud run from Shin-Ra and the Nibelheim Incident from the time the fire started.  You get a book with a story around Barret [explaining how he got his gun arm], Denzel [how he got to live with Tifa], and on Tifa.  You get a book with the ENTIRE script for the movie  And you get postcards: Two of Cloud and Kadaj, one of Cloud, Sephiroth, Kadaj, Cid, Barret, and Tifa, two of Cloud and Sephiroth, and one of Loz, Yazoo, and Kadaj.    My favourite find in the book was of course the Postcards and the extra 15 minute anime. The anime is of course only available to watch in Japanese, but it has several different subtitles though.    For the price it is well wroth because of all what you get inside this one box and it comes with this nice box to hold it.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|This is a truly extraordinary series. I bought it for my little brothers who are 4 and 6 and they love it. It's interesting and exciting enough to keep them entertained so I would recommend it to everyone.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Well worth the wait from the last album. Michael Buble fans will not be disappointed by his charm and crooning abilities. His two original songs are wonderful. Michael does NOT disappoint!! He puts his own spin on all of the classics, and performs them even better than the originals. He adds a modern take on classic music, and opens up young listeners to the world of jazz and easy listening.
1582701709|2.0|Just got rid of it..don't bother, one persons opinion and certainly not for everyone
B000002HK4|5.0|This twenty minute epic is everything Dream Theater stand for, done perfectly. It doesn't ever get boring, and the energy of the first 5 minutes lasts through the whole song - something that newer epics from DT, namely Octavarium, can't seem to do. <br /> <br />It starts with an acoustic interlude, which leads into a roaring riff from Petrucci. It continues like this for a while, fading between great drums, great bass, great guitar - and then the vocals come in. <br /> <br />The best DT lyrics ever are in this song, all about missed opportunities and chances. Beautifully sung by LaBrie. <br /> <br />About 14 minutes in is one of the greatest moments in music, and DTs finest. The lyrics are powerful, the music haunting - its a perfect emotional buildup, leading into a bluesy solo by petrucci. <br /> <br />The whole thing continues to unfold, over proggy soundscapes to acoustic interludes, until it reaches the last verse. <br /> <br />Its a ridiculously ambitious album, flawlessly pulled of by the masters of technical music today, by far their most underrated. I STRONGLY advise anyone new to Dream Theater to buy this. An awesome album. 5 stars.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|\\"Far cry\\" song with some influence of Vapor Trails songs (in the chorus parts that Geddy's \\"Uhhhh, Uhhhh\\" thing! ). <br />Geddy L. playing amazing and singing very well as ever and \\" to sewing\\"  melody in Alex L. \\"crazy\\" chords. <br />Masterized loud as a bomb , it's fine! 13 songs, maybe too long cd. <br />I don't know exactly until what point,the co-producer Nick R. made some interference in the overall sound of the cd, but sounds more \\" trip rock \\" than ever, but in a \\"different way\\" of song constructions.I mean, Rush played prog rock in various parts of the arrangements, some kind of \\"experimental\\" directioned thing ( Maybe the co-producer?) <br />Very heavy guitar sounds. Good job of Alex L. in the heavy/acoustic guitars. <br />Neil P. playing amazing .The sound of his snare could be more open like in the VH good times :-). The lyrics very strong poetic in a social/introspective way. The track 12 is my favourite, very heavy instrumental piece. <br />The instrumental \\" The main monkey business \\" have an funny synth melody resolving the melody in a crazy note/chord .( Tipically Rush's surprise way of make music. ) <br />This Cd is awesome.Very powerfull songs. <br />Im still waiting an total conceptual Rush Cd. <br />Peace.

B000OT6V00|5.0|First saw it in the theater and thought to myself \\"What a mess of a movie\\".  It is all over the place.  Saw the director's cut on dvd and thought to myself, much better.  Character development was apparently stripped from the theatrical release.  Now I see the same Director's Cut in BLU-RAY......WOW!!!  Seeing it again on a big screen TV in high definition is the way to go with this movie.  It seems the more I watch it, the more I fall in love with it.  The video looks absolutely stunning.  This is now one of my favorite show-off films in blu-ray.  Friends and family come over and want to watch something on my setup, Hellboy is now my film of choice.  As an action flick, the sound is just to die for.  Special effects and fight scene audio take the movie to another level.  I show it off with the 5.1 PCM and it never lets me down.  A friend of mine came over and said he didn't like the movie before, but after watching it again on my ps3 with big screen and surround sound, even he said it's great.

0385333846|4.0|Vonnegut's wild satire reminds me of nothing so much as Catcher in the Rye, in tone at least. Bitter and dark with flashes of biting hilarity, his novel is an Alice-in-Wonderland, Matrix-type of manifesto in which a hapless young man, Billy Pilgrim, crisscrosses the world in his wanderings from a planet inhabited by beings called Tralfamadorians to his staid(on on the surface at least) optometry practice in New York to a hellish prisoner-of-war camp in World War II. Through him Vonnegut explores the nature and lack of human connection to this world, the tragicomic loneliness of human existence, and most of all the absurdities of war, bringing a fantastical touch and his own experience to the terrible tragedies he depicts. The book is slightly difficult to read due to its rapid shifting between settings and times, but Vonnegut's prose is smooth and rapidly moving. Not a book I would recommend to everyone - its black humour can be a little hard to take, especially in large doses - but if Salinger's tone rubs you right, read this book. \\"So it goes\\".

1594489505|5.0|Backward person that I am, I haven't read THE KITE RUNNER as yet, so I have no opinion on whether A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS is better. I do know that Hosseini may have unintentionally strayed from his stated intentions. By far, the most dynamic character in the book is not Miriam or even Laila, but Rasheed, the villainous little shoemaker, whom Miriam is forced to marry when her mother commits suicide. Rasheed starts out as a rather likable sort, but we have a hunch that might change when he brings his new wife a sky blue \\"burqa\\" as a present. He's such a well-rounded character. Although he's an abusive man with a murderous temper, forcing Miriam to chew rocks at one point, he stays with his family through thick and thin, and there's no doubt he loves his son. He's also kind of funny at times, such as his inability to deal with a new baby in the house.<br /><br /> Don't get me wrong. Miriam and Laila are compelling characters, but they act pretty much the way one would expect them to. Rasheed is more of a cipher as is Jalil, Miriams's father. Jalil really loves his daughter, but he has three wives and ten legitimate children, and he can't get past the shame of his affair with a family maid. However, one of the most touching scenes in the book is when Jalil sends Miriam a package containing a video of the cartoon Pinochio.<br /><br /> I have to admit I had a little trouble with Hosseini's liberal use of Farsi. There are certain words you can decipher, such as \\"kolba,\\" a mud hut, \\"harami,\\" an illegitimate child, and \\"jo,\\" which apparently means dear one, but others such as \\"pahlawan\\" and \\"degeh\\" left me grasping for context clues. Then, inexplicably, towards the end, Hosseini abandons them all together.<br /><br /> Another compelling \\"character\\" in the book is Afghanistan itself. Hosseini outlines its history from just before the Russian invasion to the American invasion after 9/11. I guess I just assumed the Taliban were Mujahideen. Although it got a bit treacly toward the end, I thought A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS was almost as good as Mahfouz's PALACE WALK , and all he did was win the Nobel Prize for literature.THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS was almost as good as Mahfouz's PALACE WALK , and all he did was win the Nobel Prize for literature.

These are just a springboard for what this movie really is--a well-paced comedy with the best actors in the business. The comic timing is as good as anything coming out of the Will Farrell or Ben Stiller camps. Have fun with this thing and don't take it too seriously.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I watched this on the Discovery Channel and was amazed by the work these photographers accomplished.  This series of DVD's really shows what an exciting and wonderous world we live in. I was a bit disappointed that this particular set was not narrated by Sigorney Weaver, but David Attenborough also does an excellent narration of this series.

0446528056|4.0|A 2007 Summer Reading List mini review.   <br /> <br />My wife recently told me that I would enjoy this book.  After reading the prologue, I wasn't sure.  I did not want to read a love story where I find out in the prologue how it ends.  If I want to know how a book ends, I just skip to the end like normal neurotics.  Then I realized my wife doesn't read prologues.  She doesn't read prologues, forwards, text notes; sometimes she doesn't even read the book.  <br /> <br />I am very glad I hung in after the prologue debacle.  Dear John is not just a remarkable love story.  It is the love stories of several remarkable characters.  Sparks ably explores bonds of friendship, family and love culminating in an epilogue (which my wife probably didn't read) that satisfies the reader even if that already knew how the book would end.   <br />

B000OZ2CZW|3.0|Upon picking up Good Girl Gone Bad, the third and most recent album by the excruciatingly beautiful 19-year-old Barbados dancehall reggae singer Rihanna (born: Robyn Rihanna Fenty), I slightly cringed at the album's title, thinking she had gone the route of most pop diva starlets (i.e. Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, etc.) by thinking that growing older means one has to flaunt and exploit sex and sexuality in order to showcase how much older she's become. When's it gonna sink in, ladies? Growing older and more mature does not mean you have to talk dirty and dress in skimpier outfits. Luckily, although there are a few songs on this album that have many sexual innuendo, upon listening to the title track, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad,\\" the last track on the album, I'm relieved to hear that the title doesn't mean what most audiences would think it to mean. And that's the exact theme that Rihanna uses throughout Good Girl Gone Bad. Not only is this green-eyed Bajan one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen (she should be People Magazine's top most beautiful person), but she's also shown with each album release that she's growing not only in age but artistically as well.<br /><br />Anyone who's listened to contemporary pop/rock/R&B radio knows Rihanna from her earlier hit singles \\"Pon De Replay,\\" \\"S.O.S.,\\" \\"Unfaithful,\\" and \\"Break it Off.\\" Her first album, 2005's Music of the Sun was chock full of summer dance anthems, headlined by the reggae dance tune (in the tradition of Sean Paul or Daddy Yankee, both of whom I despise) \\"Pon De Replay\\" (which I surprisingly enjoyed) that would most likely be played in any teenage girl's radio with her convertible top down and on the way to either the mall or the beach. Last year's A Girl Like Me wowed many critics who passed off Rihanna as merely another pop teen sensation. The album blended the summer dance jams that most of her fans enjoy with ballads such as \\"Unfaithful,\\" penned by Ne-Yo.<br /><br />The first song and also the first single, \\"Umbrella,\\" features Def Jam president and rapper extraordinaire Jay-Z in an intro that only lasts a little over thirty seconds, thusly not really deserving his \\"featuring\\" title in the credits (but he still gets this title because he's the president of the company and/or he's a big name in the music business). Supposedly, Mary J. Blige turned down the chance to record this song, and, after hearing Rihanna's version, I'm sure she's kicking herself for that. After Jay-Z's intro, drum beats bring on Rihanna's voice, which doesn't go as far as it could go in this song. But that's a good thing. I have the feeling that if she had tried to project her voice as high and as loud as she could, the song would've come off as some Mariah Carey-wannabe knockoff. This song is her best single to date and it's one of the best pop songs on the radio right now! Unfortunately, we're brought next to a song that starts to touch into that overtly sexual territory that I was talking about earlier. \\"Push Up On Me\\" is exactly how it sounds: a song littered with 80's beats and sexual suggestive lyrics that are a mere excuse to make a dance song so that girls can grind into guys' groins. The one good thing about this song is it automatically transitions into the - one I'm guessing will be - the next club hit, \\"Don't Stop the Music.\\" With its techno beats and a sample of Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something,\\" \\"Don't Stop the Music,\\" reminds me of the club beats I used to dance to back in the day. And I can already picture many remixes of this song on those Ultra Dance compilation albums (maybe volume 10?). Its infectious beats make me want to just move and dance; a good, catchy song.<br /><br />Track four is \\"Breakin' Dishes,\\" which I wasn't too impressed with (although it is catchy). Starting with gratuitous unifying girl-shouting chorus, the song just seems like some girl singing about her bravado in wanting to try and show how tough she isby saying she's not going home until the police show up and that she's gonna fight a man. Plus, the lyrics don't make much sense. I enjoyed the following track, \\"Shut Up and Drive,\\" so much more. The song begins with a sample of New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\" guitar riffs before going into synthesizer beats and notes. The song has enough driving-and-sex metaphor to make even the most hardcore nasty rapper blush! But Rihanna sings it in her usual come-hither voice, automatically making a dance hit. The next track is a duet with her \\"Unfaithful\\" writer Ne-Yo, called \\"Hate That I Love You.\\" It's a song starting off with acoustic soul guitar where each of the singers are addressing each other about the playfully annoying ways that they get on each other's nerves but recognize that that's exactly why they care so much for each other. The song is decent in a laid-back R&B acoustic soul way, but singers like Ne-Yo start to get all my nerves. I mean, take my generation's new jack soul R&B singers, who sound just like Ne-Yo: Tevin Campbell, Brian McKnight, R. Kelly, and Babyface. Look where those guys are now, Ne-Yo. `Cause you'll soon be joining their ranks in obscurity.<br /><br />\\"Say It\\" is a mediocre song about a young woman's pleading to the man she loves to open up to her by talking more about his feelings and thoughts. The music stands out with an oriental-sounding influence (which is Mad Cobra's \\"Flex\\"), and with the multiple vocals (all supplied by Rihanna), sounding like En Vogue or Destiny's Child. The lyrics are so idealistic (almost to the point of naïve) that it's easy to recognize that Rihanna didn't write these lyrics; they were written by older men who have this conception of how young women her age feel. It should be noted that unlike her first two albums, Rihanna didn't do any songwriting on this album. \\"Sell Me Candy\\" again peeks into that naïve, sexual innuendo territory with Rihanna trying to convince this man she likes to drop his current girlfriend and hook up with her by singing sexually suggestive lyrics with candy references. Luckily, this song only runs a little over two-and-a-half minutes, and it goes into the extremely catchy \\"Lemme Get That.\\" This song returns Rihanna to her dancehall reggae roots and it's a welcomed reception with the perfectly positioned use of horns. The lyrics speak of a woman who's using her sexuality to get the material possessions she wants. Ironically, near the end of the song, she sings \\"I'm not a gold digger.\\" Well, actually, if you are using your body and sexuality to get material things and/or money, then you are. The song is catchy and good to dance to, but, sadly, I can see most young women embracing this song and \\"Sell Me Candy\\" as their anthems, blaring them in their cars as they sing along to the lyrics at the top of their voices.<br /><br />From the dance-crazed oblivion of \\"Lemme Get That\\" to the next song, \\"Rehab,\\" written by Justin Timberlake (who also supplies a few barely-noticeable background vocals), the album makes a sharp turn into more serious, profound subject matter. This song is about a girl realizing how wrong she was to devote her life and love to the guy she's dumping. She loved this man so much he was like a drug to her and the song is her getting over him, hence the title. This song is a slightly slower song and this is the song most women should be embracing. There are too many women today (particularly, young women) who date or go out with the biggest jerks who deep down are selfish and only want them for their own purposes. And the fact that this song both identifies that, but also delivers up proof that these women aren't alone and that they can get over these guys, is why this song is so much more important.<br /><br />Next is \\"Question Existing,\\" featuring a slow, sweeping beat and Rihanna's voice slightly digitally altered as if she's speaking in some dream. I admire her honesty and insight into her personal life and feelings. Even though she didn't receive any songwriting credit, I'm sure the singer gave some input to the writers for this song; especially with lines like: \\"I'm just like you/Do the mistakes I make make me a fool/Or a human with flaws/Admit that I'm lost/Round of applause/Take the abuse/Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose\\" and \\"Dear diary, it's Robyn/Entertaining is something I do for a living/It's not who I am/I like to think that I'm normal/I laugh/I get mad/I hurt/I think guys suck sometimes/I don't know who to trust/I don't know who wants to date me for who I am/Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am.\\" Again, this isn't so much a song as it's a journal entry, with Rihanna unabashedly speaking her thoughts and feelings, and, in the process, showing other young women that they're not alone in their insecurities and doubts. After \\"Question,\\" we come to the title track \\"Good Girl Gone Bad,\\" which isn't about Rihanna transforming her image. No. It's an acoustic guitar-filled warning for all boys/guys/men out there that they should start being more respectful and gentlemen-like to girls/women. `Cause if they don't, as Rihanna warns, \\"once a good girl goes bad, we gone forever.\\" In her own way, she's saying that not all girls are the superficial, gold-digging sluts that most likely once hurt them. I like this song and even though it's not the strongest song on the album (that goes to \\"Umbrella\\" and \\"Don't Stop the Music\\"), it's still enjoyable and a suitable finish.<br /><br />If I had to rate this album from one to five stars, I'd give it a three-and-a-half. Rihanna is growing with each album release as each one showcases her ever-growing maturity; I can't wait to see what she's releasing in the next two to five years `cause I think her music will not only master the dance club genre but delve deep into the ballad territory. Even the unlikeable or questionable songs are catchy. Just like any teenager, she's got more to learn, but, unlike most teens, she knows it. And as long as she keeps out of the craziness of \\"celebrity\\" (i.e. marrying young to some deadbeat dancer, shaving her head, getting addicted to drugs/alcohol, partying all the time, making a sex tape only to have it leaked on the Internet, etc.), she'll do great with her voice and the songs that come her way. It seems like she's putting music out there that best personifies what she's currently going through in her life. As a musician and music lover, what more could you ask for? While Good Girl Gone Bad is not for everyone, it still doesn't keep it from being some catchy music and great to dance to.nd hook up with her by singing sexually suggestive lyrics with candy references.

6303109950|5.0|Excellent movie. Hard to beat if you are a true western fan. Amazon service is great!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|This album is an all-time favorite of mine (except 1 or 2 tracks) and it sounds great too - just make sure you get the remastered edition! Extremely inspired tracks that are always a delight to listen to! It's certainly a classic: I've been listening to it over the past 25 years or so and it's still as fresh and exciting as ever!
006112429X|5.0|Excellent read, but be prepared: it's so very sad!
B0000U5RNU|5.0|Johnny English is my favorite comedy of all time! I've seen it at least 20 times over he past 3 years and am still not tired of it, on the contrary, I find it extremely delightful every time! If you like Rowan Atkinson, make sure you don't miss this comedy! The role of a clumsy secret agent suits him to a T and this is British humor at its best! I've watched a lot of British comedies and this, along with the Blackadder series 1, 2, and 3, are my absolute favorites! Of course much of it is based on cliches, but Atkinson's way of dealing with these cliches is most unexpected and therefore very refreshing.
B00003CXBH|3.0|One of a trio of big-budget films that was intended to turn Goldcrest into a major producer after a run of successful (mostly) low-budget films but which instead all but destroyed the company, The Mission isn't as irredeemably disastrous as Revolution or as over-reaching as Absolute Beginners, but it's still a disappointment despite its many admirable qualities. Screenwriter Robert Bolt has an interesting, if obscure story to tell in the violent closure of the 18th Century Jesuit missions in Paraguay as part of a territorial wrangle between Spain and Portugal, with the Vatican going along with genocide to avoid political repercussions in Europe while the priests in the missions try to protect their native Guarani converts from the slave traders simply waiting for the Church to withdraw its protection. Robert Bolt's screenplay is strong, thanks to Chris Menges' cinematography the film looks superb and Ennio Morricone's score is one of his best. Yet the film feels as if something is missing, possibly because it is: the work-in-progress version that won the Palme D'Or at Cannes was reputedly nearly twice as long. What's left tells the story and makes its points, but doesn't really touch the heart or carry you along with more than academic interest. But perhaps worst of all, there's a gaping hole where the heart of The Mission should be in the form of Robert De Niro.<br /><br />He looks the part, learnt fencing, speaks Spanish, yet for all that it's a hollow shell of a performance hiding behind underplayed surface detail. On paper his character is easily the film's most interesting, going from slave-trader to Jesuit missionary only to find himself at odds with his vows when he needs to protect those he used to prey on with force, but De Niro brings nothing to the part in a passive, detached and unemotional performance. His crisis of conscience and road to possible redemption seems no more torturous that trying to decide what to order from a disappointing restaurant menu. Very much a supporting role, if it weren't for his reputation you'd have no idea he's supposed to be the great actor of his generation.<br /><br />By contrast, Jeremy Irons, often a stuffy and mechanical performer, is something of a revelation here, taking the part to heart and abandoning all artifice to give a performance that draws its strength from its genuine humility and humanity. But the film's best performance comes from Ray McAnally as the Papal representative sent ostensibly to judge the matter but in reality to provide a fig leaf for the Church abandoning its converts only to find himself all too aware of the immorality of his actions and tormented by his inability to rebel against them. It's a subtle portrait but a powerful one, and puts a genuinely human face on the film's clash between the ideals of faith and the realities of the way of the world. In many ways it's almost a pity that the film keeps him on the sidelines. (Incidentally, one of the actors playing one of the Jesuit missionaries, Daniel Berrigan, was himself a Jesuit missionary who had been threatened with excommunication, while the Portuguese villain of the piece is played by De Niro's real estate broker!)<br /><br />The 2-disc DVD comes with an excellent one hour documentary about the making of the film from the days when they weren't studio-sanctioned love-ins. Concentrating on the impact on the Waunana extras, much emphasis is placed on the possibly devastating cultural effects their involvement could have, only to be somewhat torpedoed by the telling detail at the end of the program that the entire tribe received only £85,000 for a month-and-a-half's work - apparently rather less than the fencing instructor De Niro insisted be flown in to the location to teach him got if producer David Puttnam's memoirs are to be believed (De Niro fences for a grand total of 30 seconds in the film).<br /><br />Also included are an audio commentary by Joffe and the full theatrical trailer.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is another all-time classic, another all-time favorite of mine, still as fascinating as it was 25 years ago when I first heard it. Make sure you get the remastered edition, though, it sounds much better than the non-remastered one. Extremely sensitive love-inspired tracks.
0307237699|5.0|This is the politician all of us who hate politicians have been waiting for.  A person more concerned about the greater good than party loyalty or selling out to the highest bidder.  Read the book then decide on the man!
0060005696|5.0|The book may look on the outside like a social, economic, or political critique.  But it's actually addressed mostly to individuals, and probably belongs mostly in the self-help category. <br /> <br />Most books of this kind - even some good ones - have only enough interesting ideas to justify a sizeable magazine article.  The authors of such books also usually overstate their case drastically by claiming that everything in the world that they don't like can be explained by the one insight that forms the premise of their book. <br /> <br />This book is an exception.  It's not long, but that's largely because there's no padding.  Schwartz uses several examples to illustrate his point that our modern, economically productive society has provided us with an unprecedented range of choices in areas of our lives where formerly we didn't have to even think hard to make a decision. <br /> <br />For me, one of the most thought-provoking and enjoyable things in the book was the inclusion of many creative and revealing psychological experiments which produced unexpected insights concerning how we make decisions, and what the consequences of the decision-making process are. <br /> <br />Schwartz makes a good case for his thesis that \\"choice overload\\" can have a wide range of negative results.  And instead of delivering a political diatribe or social critique, blaming politicians or greedy corporations for all of these problems, he addresses himself primarily to his readers, and tells us what he thinks WE as individuals can do to ease the undesirable consequences of having to make too many choices. <br /> <br />The only part of the book I found unconvincing was when Schwartz argues that (1) when people have to make individual choices in too many areas of life, they then have to take responsibility for the results of those choices, and (2) people who take responsibility for most of the things that happen in their lives tend to be unhappier.  I'm condensing his argument here, buthe definitely does give the impression that he believes that.  And I'm here to say that even if people who take responsibility for the results of their actions **are** unhappier, that's just tough.  The last thing we need in our society is fewer people who take responsibility for the results of their choices.  Just about every failure and every criminal that I have ever met, or known anything about, has REFUSED to accept responsibility for his or her choices - and that's why they're failures and criminals.  If taking responsibility increases your stress level, well isn't that just too bad. <br /> <br />But that one disagreement doesn't prevent me from giving the book 5 stars.  The book makes so many important points, and explains them so lucidly, persuasively, and non-ideologically, that I think everyone should read it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Fascinating series and a joy to watch without commercials.  I would recommend it for anyone.
1594200823|5.0|This book is wonderful.  We read it in our book club and it got thumbs up from everyone and engendered a lively and informative discussion.  It is a comprehensive and thought provoking look at the modern world's relationship with food as well as the issues to consider when trying to lighten our footprint on this planet.  It has really got me thinking of what I am teaching my kids with each meal I prepare for them, how we are affecting the planet with each item we buy from the market, and what diet makes sense in this modern world.  A real eye-opener and a definite must for every home library!
B0001JXQDI|4.0|I recently purchased an Acura TL that is equipped (from the factory) with DVD Audio.  Since gaining this lovely accessory, I have been purchasing discs for the car of some favorite recordings which have been reissued or remastered for DVD Audio.  Being a life-long S Dan devotee, I grabbed Gaucho as soon as I found it and went for a drive.  Although not as lively as some other DVD Audio discs I have found, Gaucho sounds great.  For instance, when Michael McDonald chimes in for his background vocal on \\"Time Out of Mind\\", it sounds like the man's head is sitting on the dashboard!!  This disc is easily worth the price.  If you have DVD Audio capability, pony up and order, now.
0440418569|5.0|My actual opinion of this book would involve giving it 3 or 3 & 1/2 stars.  It is certainly the weakest in the trilogy, and suffers many of the weaknesses it is accused of.  But let's be honest:  many of the reviews here are reminiscent of ones written on versions of the Bible, the Holy Qur'an, or various commentaries thereon.  In other words, it is clear that the people complaining loudest of Pullman's 'agenda' are merely upset that his conflicts so strongly with their own.  As for me, I found the whole series stimulating in a C.S. Lewis vein, and as a former fundamentalist Christian who has since moved on to more fulfilling things, I felt neither endorsement nor excessive denouncing of the establishment of the Christian church per se, i.e., as a whole... not to mention that, as other reviewers have pointed out, this is a fantasy world.  In short, don't let these reviews stop you from at least checking out the series, & remember that there are agendas on all sides, in this world, sadly.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Great to a see the new Wilco album- Sky Blue Sky!     I have been following Jeff Tweedy since his Uncle Tupelo days. Many would say this album is boring. I disagree. True there are no innovations. Additionally it is not a back to basics A.M.istic product. However, it is an admirable effort. Like the Beatles' \\"White Album\\", this album I think is under undue scrutiny from its fans since it must follow the legacy of such favorite albums as \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" and \\"A Ghost Is Born\\". Personally, I can't stop singing the lyrics of \\"Side With Seeds\\" and \\"Hate It Here\\", I can literally replay the guitar works of \\"Impossible Germany\\" over and over again. Call me a fan but there is a place for this Album in my collection. Afterall its Wilco!     :)
B000MXPE7O|4.0|Though not for all tastes, &#34;The Good Shepherd&#34; (2006) is an engrossing spy drama in the John le Carr&eacute; tradition. Director Robert De Niro gets the most out of his ensemble, with Matt Damon remarkably effective as the emotionally cold CIA operative and co-founder. Running nearly three hours, the film's leisurely pace works in its favor — chronicling the CIA's evolution from 1939 to the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Hopefully, De Niro will continue to explore this fascinating saga in his next directorial project.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This movie was truly Fantastic!<br /><br />The storyline and characterization has been covered pretty thoughly in previous reviews. So I  will focus more on the mechanics of the movie which is remarkable.<br /><br />The storyline and plot where clear, tight and kept your attention. Not once will you find yourself questioning the relevance of certain scenes, actions, or dialog.<br /><br />And it feels like ages since I have seen a movie/play where every single actor so completely complimented each others performance. Every scene was a finely tuned masterpiece.<br /><br /> Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell put in consistently good performances in everything they do. To see how well these actors play off of each other emphasizes the quality of their craft and unfortunately they continue to be passed over by lesser performances in every award program that is out there!<br /><br />I was absolutely mesmerized by this movie and disgusted that this movie when released did not recieve the promotion it deserved. The audiences where ripped off by being encouraged to see some mindless high budget piece of crap that is nothing more than a series of exploding car chases.<br /><br />Please watch this movie, it is so VERY worth it!

If you're expecting to get a new DVD edition you're wrong. This is still the same DVD as the last release. Nothing new except now it has a nice sleeve. Now if you don't own a copy and you want the sleeve (Like me) this is good, but if you already own the last release don't buy this one. It is no different except for the nice sleeve that covers it.

1594200823|5.0|I loved this book.  I've bought several copies for friends and family, and could have read it in one sitting, if I'd had the opportunity.  It does, simply put, make you think, and that's always a good thing, especially when it leads you to consider seemingly mundane decisions, those made on a daily basis, within a larger global context.
B000P2A256|5.0|Maroon 5 first album was very good, i was afraid the second one would be a letdown. But it isnt, is an amazing record with great songs, catchy tunes, and mostly everything that made Songs for Jane a hit. <br /> <br />My Favorite song: <br />Nothing Last Forever <br />Wont go home without you <br />Makes me wonder.
1594200106|1.0|This is a heavy-breathing Gothic number, inexpertly written. \\"Ghosties and Ghoulies and things that go bump in the night\\", along with deserted streets, gargoyles and spider webs across one's face...that sort of thing. The plot reveals itself fairly early on, and if the author expected to raise goose bumps, he would have been disappointed at least with this reader, who gave his copy half-read, to the local library.
0790729350|5.0|Great time capsule of a great era; highly recommend it. It's a shame the studio DVD production is up to par! The content is a 5, the DVD production is a 2. Much more could have been presented.

B00023BLXK|3.0|Pretty predictable if you watched the first Dirty Dancing.  Still some good dancing in this one and it was good for a movie with next to no know actors in it.  I found the activities going on during this period in Havana more interesting then the story of the main characters.  Good to watch, not good to own.
044100590X|4.0|This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here.  You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins.  The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice.
0618154248|5.0|Oh my goodness!  My 2 yr old absolutely loves these colorful, kid-friendly books.  He almost has the stories memorized and still wants them read to him several times a week.  Crayon marks wipe right off, and the little box (with handle) is perfect to keep them together and carry them on weekend trips.  I just ordered the blue set of Curious George board books, too. <br />  <br />

B000FTWB7G|5.0|I think this is a great sequel to fallen and suggest buying it if you liked the first CD
B0006A9FMI|1.0|The original Ghost in the Shell was an unusual film. Occasionally difficult to follow, exquisitely animated, featuring a very subtle use of digital animation technology, hauntingly minimal music, a totally unique vision of our near future, and a profoundly affecting experience. It perfectly blended the alienation and isolation of an increasingly mechanically-dependant culture with an individual identity crisis. It also featured some excellent and original action sequences, but the film was overall a philosphical questioning and a subconciously engaging visual feast rather than an action anime.  <br /> <br />Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, is by far a lesser film. Even standing alone, this film is substandard, and I'm utterly shocked its gotten as high a rating as it has. In terms of animation, the garish digital settings completely fail to cohesively interact with the 2d characters. Unlike the original Ghost in the Shell, which cleverly disguised most of its digital animation through its selective use and painterly renders (mostly using it for soft zooms and other effects not possible with traditional animation), this sequel really just mashes together the 2d and 3d elements, with most scenes resulting in flat 2d characters floating around in an unconvincing 3d video-game environment. Except for the wonderfully animated Basset-hound in the sequel, the 2d animation is also also a severe drop in quality from the meticulous and pain-staking detail of its predecessor. The only place the 3d animation really excels is in the scenes in the delicatessen where Batou's cybernetically enhanced brain is hacked and his vision begins to disintegrate, but it is not enough to rescue the otherwise empty animation effort. Simply compare the opening credit sequences of the two films, where one is haunting and cohesive in its unique vision, the other is flashy and overly clever and unconvincing.  <br /> <br />The story of the sequel is difficult to assess. It starts by promising moreof an action-packed story with a potentially more engaging plot. The original was intentionally never focused on this part, instead using its story-elements to present its visual/auditory messages, the characters would find a lead, then lose it, and not pick it up until the very end of the film. The end climax was a personal act of will rather than an important plot climax. The search for the 'Puppetmaster' in the original film was secondary to the Major's questioning and self-doubt in her mechanical body. The sequel initially promises a more 'clinical' story, trading off an emotional engaging story with a mentally engaging one, or rather, a more predictable detective story. However, at about the point where the two investigators visit the coroner, the concept begins to fall apart as it attempts to straddle the 'detective' story and the same emotional territory from the first film. From that point on, the film either swings from ridiculously corny action sequences to insincere and overly concise discussions on the nature of reality. The original film also showed this dichotomy, but its motives were entirely different. In the original, the discussions were sincere and self-questioning, without any of the sheen of an overly scripted conversation. The Major was a woman of great physical power with a deep-seated questioning of her own reality. In the sequel, they attempt to rehash the same territory with Batou, a man of great physical power with no such personal questioning. As such, all of the conversations seem like the characters just like to hear themselves talk. The action in the original was exciting while remaining utterly wierd and symbolic, the final action sequence featuring the Major fighting a tank in the nude with her bare arms and destroying her body in the process. In the sequel, Batou uses huge guns to mow down hapless rows of Yakuza, then engages in a ridiculous hollywood kung-fu fight with a cyborg. The sequel is action for action's sake. As for characterisation, the main character Batou shows promise very early on, especially the wonderfully affectionate scenes with his dog, but then disintegrates into a tough-guy-with-a-gun not too long after. The other characters aren't worth mentioning.  <br /> <br />The music is entirely a dissapointment. Both films feature the same musical composer, Kenji Kawai, but the sequel seems to be an overly clever re-hashing of the same themes in the original film. The Japanese choir, so alien and harsh in the first film has been watered down to something more melodic and otherwise uninteresting, the minimal sound-scapes have been replaced with some overly clever instrumentation, and the simple but affecting drums from the first film have been switched with action-packed drumming. The mood has shifted to flashy instead of primal, and becomes entirely unappealing in the process.  <br /> <br />Anybody expecting a hypnotic and subconsciously stimulating dream-like film worthy of its predessor should stay well away from this film.
B00006AL1G|4.0|I would have liked to see this be more up to date, and a bit more comprehensive.  The DVD case lists DJ Krush (whom I am a fan of) as one of the DJ's featured, but it only very quickly just shows him and mentions his name which I thought was a bit cheap.  The piece on DJ Shadow was interesting. I like the different aspects the movie covers: technical, social, history, as well as a taste of some of the personalities.<br /><br />DVD extras are interesting.  Particularly some of the instructional how-to stuff.  Almost makes me want to get some equipment and try it!
0743270754|5.0|A Team of Rivals was totally praised by my entire book club during a time when I was not able to attend. It sounded like a good suggestion for my husband, so I ordered it for him.  He stared at the thickness of the paperback, and promptly counted the pages and looked dismayed. But he began to read. I will read it when he is finished. The trick now is to keep him from telling me various parts he finds fascinating, humorous, or of special interest. I keep saying, \\"Don't TELL me about it I want to read it, too!\\" He has always been a Lincoln fan, but exclaims often about things he didn't know about the man and new ways in which he finds respect for him. He takes it with him whenever he knows he will be in a waiting room someplace. Total strangers approach to telll him they read this book and it was \\"the best book I ever read.\\" When I have a chance to read it for myself I may write another review, but for now I think this says plenty about it.
B000NA77YO|4.0|Like I said-- nice reminder of the days when Sabbath came back from the end of the Ozzy days with a vengeance. The set list is good, and yes, yes, there could have been a few more, but I think the live version of 'Children of the Sea' (from Live Evil) adequately makes up for what may be missing. (Sign of the Southern Cross, etc.)<br /><br />The new tracks leave me a little... what-- unsatisfied?  The question is, have I gotten too old?  Or has My Lord Iommi's creativity dried up? (I'm going to Hell just for saying that.) The riffs sound like a rehash of His warm ups--at best.  Or like a Sabbath cover band trying come up with something 'original.' (I'm from the Bay Area, and I've heard a thousand bands that took the first three albums, put em' in a blender, and called them 'original' stuff-- the writer included.)  For me, the new tracks come up a little short, but it's still great to hear the Sabs rippin it up in the studio again.<br /><br />Yeah, if you're a Die Hard, or a new 'Keeper of the Sign', this CD is good enough for the 10 bucks, but you're probably better off getting all the originals to truly appreciate that post Ozzy sound that was given unto the world in 1980....
0446677450|2.0|I found the first half of this book ok, but the book gets worse and worse as you read it.  Nothing in the book is concrete its all rather vague, I think there is a good reason for that.  A lot of the things mentioned sound like tax evasion, \\"Pay yourself first\\" he says.   He also pretends that corporations are these clever things that allow you to avoid taxes and fails to mention that for many people involved in business it can actually cost them more to incorporate.  All the half-truths and vagueness make the book fairly worthless.  <br /> <br />If this guy is good at anything its marketing and selling books, not investment or business.
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|If you are looking for a great Mahler set that doesn't give you the Walletdämmerung syndrome, yet you also want excellent musicians and soloists and a conductor with a most refreshing and philosophically true understanding of Mahler's music, I would recommend that you purchase this box set of Mahler symphonies with Gary Bertini.  Although Gary Bertini was not a big name in the recording industry, he was deemed as a highly esteemable conductor in Europe.  His Mahler offers a completely different sound from what you would hear from Bernstein, Abbado, Walter, and Klemperer, much closer to what Rafael Kubelik did with his Mahler, but Bertini offers a degree of transparency in his music that you cannot hear in any other conductor.  Despite the transparency, his Mahler does not lack passion.  If you want to know what I mean, you must listen to his Symphonies no. 1,2,4,5,6,7,8, and 9.  These renditions are ranked with the very best Mahlerians in a very competitive field.  Bertini is also supported by an ensemble of an extremely high calibre--the WDR or the Kölner Rundfunks Orchester.  They play with a finesse and a grace that rivals the very best Mahler orchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic, the Bavarian Radio Symphony, and the Concertgebouw.  In terms of virtuosity and beauty, the orchestra offers some of the most glorious playing and a crystalline sound balance that you would want in a world-class German orchestra. <br /> <br />The soloists are all excellent too.  You have Florence Quivar, Paul Frey, Lucia Popp, Julia Varady, Julia Hamari, and Alan Titus, among others.  You must simply hear the alto part that Quivar sings in the Resurrection Symphony!   <br /> <br />Included in this already sparkling box set is a Das Lied von der Erde with Marjana Lipovsek and Ben Heppner.  While I will always love Klemperer, Ludwig, and Wunderlich, I think this Das Lied von der Erde comes close to being one of the very best recordings of the work.  Heppner sings with his usualgolden tone and security, and sings the tenor's songs with an abandon and an elan that makes his interpretation very attractive.  Lipovsek sings the mezzo parts with a tragically imbued tone that improved over her recording with Solti years earlier.  You must listen to what she does in the Abschied.  I have never heard a more resentful and reflective understanding of this very complex movement other than Christa Ludwig, Janet Baker, and Kathleen Ferrier. <br /> <br />All in all, a Mahler box set that everyone should get along with Haitink, Chailly, and Kubelik.
0743455967|5.0|On Writing should be on the list for every writer, both aspiring and professional. While King describes what it was like for him growing up and becoming an author, he also sheds considerable light onto the craft as a whole.  <br /> <br />Some interesting points in the book include how much stock one should put into critique groups vs. their own opinion of the work, as well as the old adage: If you want to be a writer, read a lot and write a lot.  <br /> <br />This book presents King's view about writing and is straight-forward in a way that most readers will appreciate. The examples in the back of the book are extremely helpful, and the beginning of the story \\"1408\\" will give writers some insight on what it takes to revise a work. Every writer has to do it, even the famous ones.

B000O176Q6|4.0|I was impressed with this transfer to Blu-Ray.  Resolution was great, although colors and detail not as vivd (due to reproduction from old film).  Still, better than some of the newer BRD releases such as Legend of Sleepy Hollow (stay away from that one).
B000P7V46C|5.0|Just don't understand how even the band members themselves don't speak too highly about this album.  The songs are solid and are definately some of the best in the whole catalog.  Don't be put off by some of the other reviews here - the sound on this particular album is a significant improvement over the '94 remaster and the cd loaded into my computer without any problems whatsoever.  As for the songs, \\"Snowbound\\" is the one the stands out the most to be.  Nick Davis brough the drums out and really have them stand out to deliver the power of the song.  SOOOOOO much better than on the '94 remaster.  If you compare the 2, you'll be amazed.  \\"Deep In The Motherlode\\" is amazing as is \\"Many Too Many.\\"  Every fan should have this new issue.

B000002H4C|5.0|We all have guilty pleasures, and for me the Heavy Metal soundtrack is one of mine. It is not \\"metal\\" of the current genre; it marks a step in the evolution from Deep Purple to Metallica. It rocks in a time before the compact disc. It is the height of FM radio, vinyl, 8-track tapes and cassettes. It comes from a time after disco and before new wave. It comes from my youth, so I am biased. <br /> <br />One of the things I appreciate in the album is that it is incredibly well balanced between the hard (Hagar, Riggs, Nazareth, and Black Sabbath), the soft (Felder's \\"True Companion\\" and Stevie Nicks' \\"Blue Lamp\\"), guitars (Hagar, Nazareth, Riggs, and Trust), and keyboards (Felder, Journey, and BOC), but there are strong vocals throughout. For sure I have my favorite tracks, but, IMO, there is not a weak track on the whole album. Some people may think that the Journey ballad or Felder's \\"True Companion\\" are out of place, but when taken in the context of the movie, they are as essential as the title track. It is one of the best road trip albums ever released.  <br /> <br />This album is not \\"metal\\". Some of the bands are the precursors of the metal genre, but this album makes no pretense of being metal. The name comes from a movie released in 1981 that was derived from a magazine of the same title. The album is firmly within the hard rock tradition. If you only want metal, this is not your CD. However, if you are open to, or enjoy, hard or classic rock and want to listen to an iconic example of pop culture from the late 70's and early 80's give \\"Heavy Metal\\" a listen. <br />
1932100660|5.0|In 2002, I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma.  As any cancer patient knows, one becomes obsessed with fear of dieing.  For four years I would go to bed at night and try not to be overcome by this fear, and my first thought in the morning upon waking would be of death.  The day after I read \\"The China Study\\", I woke up and the fear was not there.  Now I go to bed thinking of the wonderful day I had and wake up refreshed, ready to face another glorious day.  (I work for my naturopath and recommend this book every chance I get!)
0312305060|5.0|\\"The Hours\\" is a novel not to be missed.  Having seen the film version when it was first released, I enjoyed the story, but was not overwhelmed by it.  I thought the plot was interesting - a day in the life of an ordinary woman broken up into three different stories, each with a woman at the height of her mental prowess, discovering and journeying through a typical, usual day.   I was struck by the film at the brilliance of how the plots were woven together and how the idea of \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" could make each woman more aware of her own surroundings and ideals.  I thought the acting in the film was brilliant, but it lacked something.  I filed it away in my thoughts and did not really think about it again for a few years.   <br />I decided to pick up the book of \\"The Hours\\" on a whim at the library.  The name Michael Cunningham came to mind, and I couldn't really place why.    So I strolled over to the fiction section under C, found \\"The Hours,\\" and checked out.  I'm not sorry that I did.  Michael Cunningham has a way with words - he has officially brought prose to a new level.  The text is so eloquent, so beautifully formed, that I must admit to feeling pangs of envy that I will never be able write in such a fashion.  Such feelings were brought home when I read about how each woman felt inferior (doesn't everyone?), and how each felt that they had not made a proper impact with their life.   <br />Of course, this book is a modernization of sorts on \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by Virginia Woolf.  One of the three central characters is Virginia Woolf, with the others being Clarissa Vaughan (a direct \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" transcription - the main character is named Clarissa Dalloway), who is referred to as Mrs. Dalloway, and homemaker Laura Brown.  The idea of a loving kiss with another woman is center to each of their stories - another idea directly from \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"  It would hinder the proposed reader to learn too much about this book before reading it.  Let it suffice that each character is interwoven with the next in the most intriguing way - the ending and how everything comes together was my personal \\"best part.\\"   <br />I would say that when reading Michael Cunningham's book, I felt that although I just enjoyed the words so much - the way that they flowed together and created an astounding prose, that the brilliance would have been lost if the interweaving stories in the three part narrative had not been so convincing and well done.  For these reasons, I believe that Cunningham is one of the few writers today that will last for generations in the cannon.  \\"The Hours\\" is sheer beauty on every page.
B000E1155E|4.0|If you like big names from the UK, no one's bigger. It doesn't live up to the hype completely, but it's catchy and entertaining. I find myself singing along with it all the time.
B000002HJR|5.0|Where did this album come from? Deep in the swamplands of America, five guys originally from New Orleans holed up and created one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Sounding fresh and innovative but still rooted in old Sabbath riffs and swagger, this album detonates your mind and soul.<br /><br />One part Jack Daniels and one part Reefer Madness, this album absolutely surpasses any expectations you will have. Not fast or intense like Slayer or Pantera, but a different breed of animal. One that crawls into your brain and finds sweet refuge behind the blistering riffs of Pepper and vocal scowls of Phil.<br /><br />There is nothing else out there that matches this record in terms of riffs, attitude, and mood.<br /><br /> This album is a must have, period.
B000O178BY|5.0|I didn't start listening to NIN until With Teeth, but then got their other albums after that because I liked them so much. After listening to Year Zero, I can understand what people mean by a \\"return to their old sound\\" - I loved With Teeth, but Year Zero has the electronica in it that I think With Teeth didn't have as much (comparatively, of course). <br /> <br />Simply a beautiful album, and the backstories that you can look for in each one just sweeten the deal. My favorite ones are the kind of Indian-synth sound of \\"Good Soldier\\" and the practically demonic sounding anthem of \\"God Given\\". <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to Trent's next brainchild already. I hope he keeps up with this vein, but in my opinion, everything he's put out has been great, just great in different ways.
0061122416|3.0|This book was a good little book because it could have delivered the same message by taking us on a journey from New York to California, but it didn't... it took us from Spain to Egypt and that is what makes it enjoyable. The charm comes from the gypsies, dessert dwellers, kings, even Santiago's relationship with his sheep. As so many books we've all read before, this fast read reminds us to follow your dreams, follow your heart, and \\"don't give in to your fears,\\" in a simple succinct fashion.<br /><br />\\"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself.\\"  - Paolo Coelho, The Alchemist

I could NOT put this book down, I read it in 2 nights and would have read it faster if I could.  For an unemotional person, I found myself having to blink away swells a couple of time in order to press on.  During the book Mariam would hold her breath in anticipation, I found myself doing the same as I read. This book is like no other book I have ever read before.  Having not read The Kite Runner I can't comment or offer comparison, but I can tell you that I'm buying it today.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|\\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is an unabashed tearjerker about the American Dream and commitment to family in the face of great odds. It was inspired by the true story of Chris Gardner, who spent some time in the 1980s homeless while trying to care for his young son and make it through a stockbroker internship. The film is fictionalized but stays true to Gardner's struggle for success and dedication to his son. Gardner's autobiography, which goes by the same title, was actually published after the film was written. In San Francisco, 1981, Chris Gardner (Will Smith) can't make ends meet selling portable bone density scanners, while his embittered wife Linda (Thandie Newton) waitresses 2 shifts a day. Chris spies a man with an enviable sportscar on the street one day and asks him what he does for a living. He's a stockbroker. So Chris decides that's what he'll be. He must be at the top of his class after 6 months in Dean Witter's competitive internship program to be hired. Meanwhile, Chris has no wife, no money, no paying job, and a 5-year old son (Jaden Smith).<br /><br />A story of hardship and hard work, paternal love and frustration, could easily be too saccharine for words. It's saved from this fate by Chris Gardner's desperation. Behind his indomitable pluck, Gardner is truly desperate. He has no money, no home, uncertain prospects, and the responsibility of providing for a young child. He hides his circumstances from his colleagues. He's spends an inordinate amount of energy chasing errant bone scanners around town. He compromises his ethics. His single-mindedness eventually takes a toll on his son. Chris is struggling for his life. And his financial problems are something the audience can understand and may themselves fear. That's why \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" works so well. Credit is due Will Smith's Oscar-nominated performance and Italian director Gabriele Muccino's understanding of intense emotions painted with small strokes.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2007): There are 4 featurettes, the song \\"I Can\\" by Bebe Winans and Dave Koz (5 min, audio), and a feature commentary. \\"Making Pursuit: An Italian Take on the American Dream\\" (17 min) interviews Gabriele Muccino, Will Smith, and the producers about choosing Muccino to direct.

B0002BO0AS|4.0|I love this album, full of heavy chops, pounding drums and no cheesy cream puff ballads.  It's too bad they have so many bands have this same forumla and sound because I think Unearth does this type of metal with great style and aptitude.  They have all the awesome breakdowns I live to hear and they aren't afraid to exploit them.  This is good stuff if you like a guy with a killer scream, awesome guitars and a few solos that are decent.

B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Sean Penn, without a doubt, is the heart and soul of this movie... Mystic River is one of the very best of Clint Eastwood's pictures and it features highly charged emotions in a great screenplay that flows beautifully despite the length of the film... It all comes back to childhood this is something (I think) we should all know - and something the characters in this movie discover as they fumble around trying to right the wrongs of the world.. Tim robbins' character (i try to be careful not to give away plot elements) is torn inside from a childhood experience and sees the world as a place where vampires roam and suck the blood of the innocent - something he takes upon himself to venge against.. Sean Penn's character is intent on finding justice himself following the death of his daughter.. and kevin bacon (who is a cop) is obviously trying to make up for the wrongs of the world - all three try and fail - because at heart they are children (like we all are) born to suffer in an unjust world.. Mystic river will make you cry if you truly let it break through your personal barriers.. Though i am not normally a fan of such movies (i generally find them predictable) 'mystic river', despite its rehashed dramatic techniques, works out - highly recommended..
1582701709|2.0|I read the book for about 1/2 hour and couldn't persist further. Nothing new, full of banalities and platitudes. Also obviously an easy collage of quotations. I can't figure out why it ranks as one of the bestsellers. Perhaps the minds of our modern populace are so softened in this age that readings not requiring much cerebral work hold great appeal.

B00005JPLW|4.0|Honor, courage, belief...these are all values that today's society seems to have forgotten about.  Leonidas, his men, and all of Sparta believed fiercely that certain things were worth fighting and dying for.  Today, certain things are still worth fighting for...even if you know you'll lose, you sometimes just have to do the right things.  Our society, especially since 9/11 and Operation: Iraqi Freedom, needs to remember that some men might have to die in order to secure our country's safety.  Those of us who have been in the service, or are currently serving, understand that.  Otherwise, we wouldn't be so proud to have done what other's were either unwilling or unable to do.  May King Leonidas' message be remembered forever...OOH-RA!

B0000C8AQM|5.0|Loved thsi CD School of Rock, so much easier to find it on Amazon instead of searching the stores.
B000INAXGU|5.0|Jay K is a musical genius, and, this compilation cd proves it. My nineteen year old borrowed this cd, to put on his Ipod. That made me feel so cool.
0061122092|4.0|I have been slowly finding time to read this book between grad school and work. Each time I begin I whish to have time to just sit and enjoy it. Today was that day as I awaited my tires to be mounted I sat in the sun and read this wonderful story. I saw so much of my own life reflected in the emotions, very well written and inspiring. I am passing it on to my mother so that she too can benifit from this work of art.<br /><br />With all the praise why a 4 star rating? Well, although I truly love this story I was conflicted over some parts that just seemed to loose me. I read and reread certain passages just to get what happened. And still I found myself wondering too much with some odd unresolved feelings.<br /><br />I loved the story I loved the dedication to the concepts of \\"LOVE and LOYALTY.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone. As for me on to the next of his books...
B000PFUAO6|3.0|For the record, I have followed Dream Theater since Images and Words came out.  I enjoy all their CDs, even Falling into Infinity.  Scenes is probably my favorite.  I like Octavarium better than Train of Thought.  If I had to pick favorite songs it would be really hard since there's so many good ones, but probably: Home, Learning to Live, Hell's Kitchen, Root of All Evil is a good representative sample so you know where I'm coming from. <br /> <br />I was really excited when I saw all the positive reviews about the new album.  But after listening to it the first time, I was thinking \\"what are these juvenile songs?\\"  I completely agree with the other reviewer who said he felt like he was too old to be listening to this stuff, which has never happened with Dream Theater before.  I am also 30. <br /> <br />The first track starts the album off on a promising note, but that promise is never fulfilled.  The music for Forsaken is good enough to ignore the cheesy lyrics.  And I, unlike most people apparently, think Constant Motion is a decent song.  At least it doesn't have the cheesy fantasy lyrics like so many of the other songs.  It's not that imaginative lyrics can't be good.  Scenes from a Memory is a great example of a story which works (or Hemispheres, by Rush).  Dark Eternal Night is something I never feel the need to ever listen to again.  In Repentance, it's nice to hear the old themes being used in different ways, but the song is maybe a bit too long.  Prophets of War is different, and listenable I guess.  But Ministry of Lost Souls?  It's about 10 minutes of slow uninteresting music with cheesy lyrics, with a good instrumental break, and a decent outtro, but one that is probably a minute too long.  And the last track also has interesting instrumental sections, but they are not nearly as good as the intricate arrangements on previous albums, and the cheesy lyrics ruin the song again. <br /> <br />This will go down as easily Dream Theater's worst effort to date.And it kills me to say that- they are one of my absolute favorites, and one of the few bands I have faith left in to produce a decent outing.  Also one of the greatest bands to see live.  Let's hope this album represents them getting the fantasy crap out of their system and they can move on to better stuff next time, more of the quality we've come to expect.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Everything Michael Buble sings I love.  This isn't my favorite cd of his, however it's classic Buble.  I don't like that he overlaps his songs from one cd to another.  I would prefer a whole album with new songs, not some new and some from other albums.  Come on--I want my money's worth!  Yet, I love Michael Buble's songs, his voice and I did enjoy this cd.
0893860220|5.0|This is one book that should be on the shelves of any one is seeking to know what is this wonderful thing called self and what is this universe around us  . I was surprised to see such a rational treatment in spirituality. It transcends all man made boundaries and directs you into inquiring about this wonderful thing called self. Coming from an enlightened person who had modest formal education, this is a proof of how self realization is independent of the \\"worldly knowledge\\" that we seem to stress a lot especially in the modern world. Definitely 5 sizzling stars for this book.
B000RB44DQ|2.0|Imagine someone turning the sound down on a David Attenborough documentary, then describing what they see over the phone. If you ended up with a transcript of this you're somewhere in the ballpark of `Encounters'. We're so spoiled these days for high quality nature footage that there's really little need for what, in its time, may have been an enjoyable and informative book. While Durrell puts an individual stamp on his recollections, the meat of it is describing creatures that we're far better off seeing (and now able to). Durrell produced these chapters for radio's dying years (the book is a transcript) - when it was still king for more than music and talkback. Pictures of his subjects were still relatively rare, so words had to do. The black and white sketches in my edition help a little, but they're like bikes against jets when you compare them to some of the incredible film now available.<br /><br />It is still possible to validly use the medium of text in relating interactions with nature, such as Adams' 'Last Chance to See', Flannery's 'Throwim Way Leg', and Bryson's 'A Walk in the Woods'. However all these books were written when television documentaries were well established, so unlike Durrell their authors knew not to set themselves up to compete in areas they couldn't hope to. Instead they focussed on individual experiences and interpretations. He was (is?) an able enough writer who had some amazing experiences to recount (cf. the beloved `My Family and Other Animals'), and where the book is more biographical it's still enjoyable. I suspect, for example, I'd find a searching interview with Durrell fascinating. However anecdotes are incidental, descriptions of invisible animals core. Or, at least, they were until I bailed about half way through this small book. Glancing through some amazon references for Durrell I see he, of course, moved with the times and in 1994 took a BBC crew with him when he went searching for the rare aye-aye lemur.<br /><br />It is interesting to note the shift in attitude from his anthropocentric generation to this one. There's nothing of the careful `hands off' approach of Attenborough - much of Durrell's delight is in trapping. An inexhaustible supply of animals still seems to largely be there for our amusement. He thinks nothing of taking sides in judging nature - as when he's grabbing a gun to save some ducklings he's grown fond of from a caiman simply about its own survival business. Some readers might find his constant personification hard to take: everything seems like a grumpy old fellow, or an excitable kid, or a vain young man in his first suit - there's little awareness of these as separate species with entirely different thought processes and agendas.note the shift in attitude from his anthropocentric generation to this one.

B000P2A256|4.0|I took a gamble pre-ordering this cd.  I thought, hey, their last cd was great so why not give them another try.  I was pleasantly surprised when I put it into the cd player in my car. It's a little more upbeat then the last, and I thought it sounded quite fresh. I hope you all enjoy it too.

0743277708|5.0|This book is beautifully written.  You forget it is only the written word, because the characters truly come alive.  The story involves the rabbits poignant struggle for survival and happiness.  Once you start it, you won't be able to put it down.  I read this as a teen, and then recently reread it.  I loved all the characters.  This is one of my favorite fiction books.  It is the type of book that you wish it never had to end!

With all her strength, courage and insight, here is a women to truly admire.

B000N6U1GE|4.0|Ok, it's not Jean-Jacques Goldman, and it's not young Celine anymore. <br /> <br />D'elles portrays a collection of songs written by different women from the french and franco-canadian scene. I'll go through them one by one: <br /> <br />Et s'il n'en restait qu'une: 4/5 <br />**** First single off the album, a very powerful and sentimental ballad, you can almost hear the old celine in this one. <br /> <br />Immensite: 4/5 <br />**** A very nice song, second single. Great music by Veneruso, who wrote many songs in celine's last french album. The string arrangements are very nice. <br /> <br />A cause: 3/5 <br />**** A fast-paced , catchy song, kind of melodramatical. Still, i think there's something missing. The arrangements are not perfect, and celine sounds nasal. <br /> <br />Je cherche l'ombre: 5/5 <br />**** One of the best songs in the album, if not the best. Beautiful music, mixing the piano with kenas, violins and accordeon.. quite a la francaise. Celine's voice sounds soft and pure, and then powerful and still pure.  <br /> <br />Les paradis: 2.5/5 <br />***** Filler material.. sounds like \\"Contre Nature\\" but with less quality in the writing. I skip this one. <br /> <br />La Diva: 4/5 <br />***** Weird song.. Celine sings along Maria Callas,kinda reminds me of \\"Papillon\\", but a little more nasal. There's a problem with some high notes, Celine seems to be stretching to get up there. Good song though, you get a few seconds Celine singing lirical.  <br /> <br />Femme comme chacune: 2/5 <br />***** Bad song, celine's voice sounds awful, and the song itself is bad contemporary, trashy pop. Skip it <br /> <br />Si j'etais quelqu'un: 3.5/5 <br />***** Nice song.. it varies from soft to bombastic/rocky.. you'll see. Not bad, but forgettable.  <br /> <br />Je ne suis pas celle 3.5/5 <br />***** The beginning sounds like \\"Tu Nages\\", but not as good as that one. It looks like a Lara Fabian song... too soap-opera dramatic.  <br /> <br />Le temps qui compte: 4/5 <br />***** Very nice and catchy song. Also sounds like \\"Contre Nature\\", it could be a good choice for a single.  <br /> <br />Lettre de George Sand a Alfred de Musset: 2.5/5 <br />***** hmmm Celine whispers too much in this one. Doesn't sound too nice. It's a slow and boring song. <br /> <br />On s'est aime a cause: 5/5 <br />***** Great song, it's a variation from song #3 but a lot better, more ballad-like. It got stuck in my head for some days. I would really like to see this as a single, although I don't think that will happen.  <br /> <br />Berceuse: 4.5/5 <br />***** Berceuse, which means \\"lullaby\\", is a very beautiful soft song, alla \\"Memoire d'Abraham\\", just the piano, the strings and Celine. The lyrics seem to be dedicated to her son, Rene-Charles Angelil.  <br /> <br /> <br />
1602831777|3.0|While I enjoyed the entire book all the way until the last paragraph, I was left greatly disappointed becuase there was no fundamentalist, reluctant or otherwise, in the book.  It was a wonderful book, however, about a student who earns his way into wealth and priviledge through an ivy league education.  He comes to understand what's wrong with his particular method of obtaining wealth, becomes disallusioned and returns to a position at university in his home country.  AT NO POINT IS THERE ANYTHING FUNDAMENALIST OR ABOUT ISLAM OR ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD \\"assume\\" from the title.<br /><br />Liberals will like this book.  Conservatives will find it mildly amusing.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|Warners have celebrated Errol Flynn's greatest film and one of the studio's greatest achievements with this spectacular 2 disc special edition. The merits of the film are well documented - perfect casting, perfect score, a timeless adventure, spectacular colour. The print is perfect and the extras on this DVD are overwhelming. Try this for starters:    - a beautifully paced and delivered commentary by Rudy Behlmer, filled with interesting information from the Warner's archives and production notes  - an hilarious Daffy Duck cartoon with Porky Pig as Friar Tuck.  - recently discovered outakes from the vaults with Rudy Behlmer explaining where they fit in  - home movies during taken production.  - a complete soundtrack of Eric Wolfgang Korngold's score  - a documentary on the history of the legend of Robin Hood including scenes from Douglas Fairbank's silent version    The is just a sample of material on this DVD.  It is outstanding value and a wonderful legacy of this timeless classic.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|When you look at the cover of this film you would think it would be an instant classic by the paring of good story, Edward Norton, and Paul Giamatti. Unfortunately only Giamatti lived up to it.<br /><br />The story trys to surprise and keep you guessing, but it fails. Each supposed twist in the tale you can easily predict. The romance aspect is hurried, and unimaginative.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful. Watching each scene was visually interesting.<br /><br />Edward Norton, though an excellent actor, was not on his game in this one. He just simply seemed bored through the whole movie.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti on the other hand made his character very interesting and engaging. He played out his character's conflict very well. Giamatti is becoming on of those actors that you have to go see his movies just because he is in it. Fortunately he saves this movie from just being a pretty movie with a sub par plot.<br /><br />This movie is good for a lazy cold night watching movies, and Giamatti is excellent, but if you want a masterpiece of mystery and magic, watch The Prestige.
B00000JPYD|5.0|This is probably the most mature heavy metal guitar album ever made.  This record has so much class.  I didn't really follow Robin Trower that much but I can honestly say that this has to be his most important and most successful album.  Even more so than anything he's ever done with Procol Harum, beforehand.<br /><br />First of all, remember, Robin Trower is the guitarist on this album.  The actual vocalist is James Dewar whom of which most people wouldn't even be aware of.  Robin Trower has actually enjoyed a good 20 years of recorded music.  Even in 1988, Robin Trower had a Top 200 album called \\"Take What You Need\\".  But, this album of \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" probably continues to get the most airplay on album rock radio, even to this day.  \\"For Earth Below\\" probably sold very well based on high anticipation because it followed \\"Bridge of Sighs\\".<br /><br />The main rock staples on this album are the title track, plus \\"Day of the Eagle\\", and the great late night acid drenched trance and funk rocker \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\".  But I enjoy every track on this album.  I've had this CD on several different remastering efforts, and I'd have to say the Mobile Fidelity Gold Disc is the best sounding release of this album on CD.  Most of the other releases (including the latest remastered CD with bonus live tracks) sound kinda muddy to me.  My Mobile Fidelity Gold CD has one unnecessary bonus track which is the 45 single version of \\"Day of The Eagle\\".  Who needs that?  I don't believe FM radio will ever play it.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of my own personal Top 10 favorite \\"guitar rock\\" albums of all time.  I hope you agree too.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Three things I think after having watched, \\"The Holiday.\\"  The first is that Eli Wallach stole this romantic comedy.  He plays Arthur Abbott, who in his younger days was an Oscar winning screenwriter and who is now a neighbor of Iris (Kate Winslet) now that the young English woman is living in the Hollywood mansion of Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who is now living in the little English cottage of Iris in Surrey.  The two women have swapped homes this particular Christmas because Iris has discovered her ex-boyfriend is getting married and Amanda just needs to get away from her job making movie trailers.  Since it is a romantic comedy both of the women meet men, with Amanda running into Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law), and Iris meeting Miles (Jack Black), a composer.  The problem is that the most interesting and endearing relationship in the film is between Iris and Arthur.  Jack Black is trying to play things straight here, something he had proven he can do already in \\"Shallow Hall\\" (when he discovers why Cadence is in the hospital), but he is totally wasted in this movie, even if Wallach is not stealing every scene he is in without breaking a sweat.<br /><br />The second thing I am thinking is that there is a reason why Kate Winslet is the youngest actress to have earned five Oscar nominations for her work.  I am not saying that this performance is worth of a nomination, but every time we had a scene of Cameron Diaz working so hard to act it was refreshing to get back to Winslet showing how it should be done.  Again, the sparks between her and Wallach are the highpoint of this film.  The third thing on my list is that they did not take advantage of the running gag of Amanda picturing a trailer of her sad and pathetic love life in her own mind.  Actually, all we usually get to hear is the familiar voice of Hal Douglas narrating the trailer, but I think there was a whole lot more mileage to get out of the idea (e.g., showing the same scenes but giving them totally different spins by changing the music and the voiceovers).<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly in terms of my ultimate evaluation of this film, I think that this film lacks a key requirement of most romances, which is the grand gesture.  Actually, it needs two grand gestures given that there are two romances trying to flower here.  Now the label of grand gesture is somewhat hyperbolic, because sometimes the boy can get the girl at [[ASIN:0800141741 \\"hello\\"]] or not [[ASIN:B00003CXCI say anything]] and just stand with a boom box playing the right song.  But I think there should be something both unique and significant that somebody does to get the person they love.  Think of your favorite romantic comedies and I bet you can think of the grand gesture, the pivotal romantic moment, in each.  In \\"[[ASIN:B00005JMFQ Love Actually]]\\" there are at least three of them, and what passes for one in \\"The Holiday\\" has to do with (surprise, surprise) Iris and Arthur.  Watching this film was enjoyable enough, but they basically fast forward to the requisite happy ending without making these characters even try to earn our tears and I am rounding up on this only because of the scenes between Wallach and Winslet.by changing the music and the voiceovers).

0385522401|5.0|With ON CHESIL BEACH Ian McEwan demonstrates, as he has done again and again, that he is one of our best living novelists. In his latest short novel that you can finish in an evening,  he returns to what he has done do eloquently in previous works where a single event or day in the life of his characters changes their lives forever. The difference here is that no malevolent evil force or random act of violence is responsible for what happens to these individuals; they are. The novel begins in 1962 when much of the world was on the cusp of the new area of free love and sexual freedom-- but not these characters. Edward Mayhew and Florence Ponting are on their honeymoon at a hotel at Chesil Beach. \\"They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible.\\" Edward, though engorged with passion, is inept at making love while Florence, although she is much in love with him, is filled with \\"disgust and shame\\" at the thought of consumating her marriage.<br /><br />While this novel will occasionally make you smile, the last ten pages or so will move you in a way that McEwan's stories seldom do and will leave you with a sense of great sadness. ON CHESIL BEACH is ultimately about lost opportunities, or in the words of Robert Frost, the road not taken.<br /><br />McEwan's evocative prose is sparse but perfect. On her wedding night, Florence, the first violinist in a fledgling but very talented string quartet, \\"plays for time.\\" Edward's apprehension about whether or not her cellist partner is his rival is alleviated when he sees that he is a \\"pudding of a fellow.\\" Florence describes \\"the reptilian jerkiness\\" of Edward's spine in his attempt at lovemaking.<br /><br />Reading McEwan is one of the joys of being alive today. His novels and stories never disappoint us; his latest is no exception.

B000001ELP|5.0|By the time Music from the Elder was released, my younger brother and I had been avid KISS fans for several years after initially getting hooked on Destroyer. We bought the older albums and played them until the needle on our record player had worn them out. When we heard the letdown that was Dynasty, we figured that was it for our favorite band. Then we saw and heard some of the new material from \\"Music from The Elder\\" on Solid Gold (if I recall correctly, the band played \\"I\\" and \\"A World Without Heroes\\"). It was so different, we figured we'd give it a chance. The next day we went to K-mart and picked up the album. To this day, it has been the only KISS album I go back and listen to on a regular basis. Sure, I love the occasional tracks off Alive II, and I do give Destroyer a spin every now and then, but the Elder is an album I'll listen to from start to finish time and again. <br /> <br />Why? The majesty of it all. The uniqueness. People can say it's the poor man's Floyd (I'm a big Floyd fan myself) or Who or whatever, but it's not. It's KISS, mostly Paul and Gene, trying to do something different. The two of them can claim all they want that they hate the album now. Anyone who has met them knows their egos are the size of houses. My guess is that the commercial failure of The Elder was too big a blow to their egos and they just had to disown it, and still do to this day. The band tried to show some vulnerability and craft something artistic instead of the usual throwaway drugs-rock-sex rockers and they got nailed for it. \\"OK fans, sorry... Um, we hate the album too. It was Ezrin's idea, not ours.\\" <br /> <br />But the bottom line here is that you do NOT spend this much time and effort building up tracks and tracks of harmonies and orchestrating horns and tailoring your vocals precisely for each track (listen to Paul on Odyssey vs. The Oath, and Gene on Mr. Blackwell vs. World Without Heroes) because you hated doing it. The tape doesn't lie. There is love and attention paid to each track. These aren't straight ahead rockers for the most part -- each song has its special intricacies and well-thought flourishes.   <br /> <br />Music from the Elder was like a child that you can hear the band really wanted to be received into the world with love. When that didn't happen, they disowned it. OK, maybe that sounds a bit silly, but I really believe that's what happened. And Gene and Paul will probably go to their grave claiming they are still embarrassed by this album. <br /> <br />But the highlights are clear. \\"Escape From The Island\\" is a pure showcase for Eric Carr. \\"Just A Boy\\" is beautifully crafted and built. Take \\"Mr. Blackwell\\" and put it on any other KISS album and it would be another awesome Gene track, right up there with God of Thunder (OK, I know that's a Paul track, but you know what I mean). The guitar solo on \\"A World Without Heroes\\" is melodic brilliance. \\"Under the Rose\\" is rich, dark, and imposing. \\"Dark Light\\" is a fantastic Ace tune, and his extended solo is a classic. <br /> <br />I'm pretty psyched that this album is finally getting the recognition it deserves from a decent number of KISS fans... Now if only Paul and Gene could find the courage to reconcile themselves with it.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I found BABEL to be hypnotic to the point that I wanted to see much more, and more. It touches not only your heart but also  all the senses in your body and it will make you think twice about humanity. <br /> <br />EVOCATIVE! COMMANDING! DISTURBING! THOUGHTFUL! MARVELOUS!  Babel is as close to a masterwork as you can get.  Delicate elements of cinema are used harshly and sensibly; the music is HAUNTING, the actors are utterly compelling and every single one of them -  stars or not - is brilliant. The story is universal and timely.  We the people of this wonderful global community need each other. Every single one of us matters and are responsible for what is going on across the earth.  Slowly we are melting into ONE, regardless of space or culture - regardless of our desires or stubbornness.  Babel shows us how judgmental and irrational people can be, how innocence is lost and violence is present in every aspect of our life. <br /> <br />I loved how Iñárritu touched upon power and authority.  Babel spans different cultures from various parts of the world and the authorities are extremely dissimilar.   Just pay attention to the Moroccan Police Squad, the Japanese detectives and the United States border patrol. Amazing what you will discover, and it is up to you how will you interpret it. The sexual awakening of the characters,  Amelia's sensible kiss at the wedding of her son,  Yuseff's father's reaction to the shocking news and the \\"walk of desperation\\" in the hot California desert will never leave my psyche. It is etched there forever like any major event in my life.  <br /> <br />Once in a great while we have a film that stands out from the rest, that is not only artistic and emotionally trenchant, but also goes beyond our expectations. BABEL holds up a large mirror for all of us to gaze in and understand who we really are. <br /> <br />Babel is a hymn to humanity, it is an elegy to our ONEness and interdependency.  <br />
B00005QENZ|4.0|There's some really good music on this album, though it's not nearly as hard rocking as fans of the older Aerosmith would expect (or perhaps want). The three singles \\"Amazing,\\" \\"Cryin',\\" and \\"Crazy\\" in particular seem like commercialized pop-rock. That isn't to say that I don't like them. As much as I generally hate rock that sounds like it was especially made for radio/MTV, those three songs are just too good to dislike. Then there are the other songs like \\"Livin' On the Edge\\" and \\"Eat the Rich,\\" which also got some attention and aren't too bad. Overall, while it's not nearly as rocking as the classic Aerosmith stuff, it's perhaps just as good.
B00005JPFC|5.0|I don't want to give too much away and spoil it for you, so I'll simply say that this movie is one of Pixar's finest.  The scenery and visuals are beautifully done.  The technical aspects of this movie are amazing to watch, and the sound track is great too.  The story line is cute cute cute and as with all Pixar movies, extremely well told.  If you have enjoyed any of their other movies, you are sure to love this one!  So go out and get your tickets for June 29th, you won't be disapointed. <br /> <br />For the fourth year in a row, Pixar opened it's studio doors last night  to the public for a pre-screening charity event to help fund our local school district, Emeryville Unified.  The event was fabulous and a total success, raising over $80,000 as it did last year with \\"Cars\\".  Through-out the year, the talented staff of Pixar volunteer their time in mentor and reading programs for our kids.  The students also get to make their own movies with the help of Randy Nelson and the Pixar University.  It's great to have a business in our tiny little town that is so committed to our community.  As an Emeryville resident, I feel honoured to have such a good neighbor. <br /> <br />Three Cheers for Pixar!
B000002JPA|5.0|Sometimes, really good things happen by coincidence. Before I actually review \\"Images and Words\\", an album of epic magnitudes, I would like to explain my discovery of Dream Theater. <br /> <br />While listening to AOL Radio, I clicked to, I believe the progressive station, and heard the \\"Rover/ Achilles Last Stand/ The Song Remains The Same\\" seven and a half minute medley from Dream Theater's mostly-covers album, \\"A Change of Seasons\\". Not knowing the glorious band I was about to get into, I bought that album and instantly loved it (I mean, come on, a 23-minute title track!) <br /> <br />It had been quite some time before I would soon rediscover my love for Dream Theater. Every now and again, I would look at lists of musicians and how high they rank, alongside bands and albums, and for each, Dream Theater ranked high (I read somewhere \\"Images and Words\\" ranked #2 on a list of the greatest progressive metal albums of all time). Deciding it couldn't hurt to revisit the band, and after listening to samples of \\"Pull Me Under\\", \\"Another Day\\", and I believe \\"Metropolis Part 1\\", (though I can't remember my reactions to the online previews), I bought it one day. <br /> <br />I didn't really know how I would feel after I listened to the album. However, I did know two things: 1) In an album, I look for the musical chops that I love and that will keep me hooked. 2) I knew what made me want to LISTEN to something. <br /> <br />That's the question I often consider when looking at an album. What about it will make me want to listen? Is it the clever use of lyrics that keep me puzzled and searching for the answers? Is it the untouchable talent that leaves me breathless (especially considering I am a multi-instrumentalist). Or is it the overall quality of something that keeps me listening to it? <br /> <br />Well, one night I sat down on my bed and played this album, and then it hit me: Dream Theater is an excellent band with dazzling songwriting, furious musical talent, and, to solve my own (problem may be overstating it, so I'll say concern), that it made me want to listen! <br />The way everything came at me was breathtaking! From the album jacket itself, the bright colors of the pictures, that flaming heart in a mansion's bedroom, the band's picture inside it what appears to be some coliseum, and the summery glow behind them. The vivid images easily accompany the music itself. <br /> <br />Ahh, there it is: the music itself. John Petrucci's blazing, and I mean BLAZING, guitar work. Eddie Van Halen and Yngwie J. Malmsteen may have invented the shred-solo technique, but John Petrucci gives many guitarists competition, as he displays intricate riffing, speedy solos, catchy hooks, and goes the whole, nine yards for us. John Myung, while not as dominant as John Petrucci, runs a tight ship, as well, displaying energetic basswork that will satisfy people who want to hear that. From the hammer-on solo (how many bassists have ever recorded THAT?!), to his overall basslines, he is a great musician. <br /> <br />Kevin Moore, though he didn't last, made a serious impression while still with Dream Theater. In just eight songs, he can prove that he can do it all. Dreamy, haunting piano lines, warm, lush synth solos (ahhh, that just says it all), and just general virtuoso skills on the keyboard. Mike Portnoy is an animal on the drumset. He pounds those big ol' plates like there's no tomorrow. This guy has some stunning chops, and yet, I feel sorry for the fact that he has an alcohol problem. You're in our thoughts, Mike. Anyway, as a musician, he's nothing short of magnificent. <br /> <br />And finally, there's the dramatic, ever-quotable James LaBrie. From his soaring, almost operatic vocals to his cool bounce-and-sway rhythm, he is the ideal frontman for a band like Dream Theater. I can hardly imagine them with a different lead singer, and can hardly imagine James LaBrie being any more perfect in a different band. When you put these five musicians together, you get the one-of-a-kind Dream Theater. <br /> <br />\\"Pull Me Under\\": A progressive opener that is perfect for kicking off an awesome album, with lyrics that say the person talking basically accepts death and all it brings. The heavy guitars and drums drive this song throughout, and James' repeated, \\"Pull me under\\", during the chorus, shows the hypnotic effects a song like this will leave on you. A great display of lyrics keep rolling, the instruments fire all of their guns at once (to quote Steppenwolf's \\"Born To Be Wild\\") and the song keeps it explosion at large until...everything stops! An amazing, eight-minute masterpiece stops on the spur of a moment, what an unusual concept! <br />\\"Another Day\\": Ooooh, there's a lot to say about this song. In terms of time, it's shorter than \\"Pull Me Under\\", at four and a half minutes. Lyrically, its focus is to keep faith and spirit and don't give up, hence the lyric, \\"so die another day\\". The songwriting on this untouchable song is in a balladic style. The acoustic-to-electric style of guitar-playing, a songwriting technique that is always used but never getting old, works perfectly, the lovely soprano sax guest musician provides two great solos and some unbelievably beautiful saxophone lines. Uhhh, it just displays the summery tinge this album can't help but contain. It makes me wanna pick up my own sax again (though I play alto), and learn this stuff again! James put his soaring vocals to use to just add more and more to the beauty of this. His vocal lines make me feel like I'm floating on a cloud in heaven! And of course, Kevin Moore's keyboards perfectly accompany this wonderful masterpiece. Such a beautiful song, man, that's just about the best way to sum it up! <br />\\"Take The Time\\": Another longer, progressive song, but nothing short of stunning, these lyrics are a bit more literal, telling you to take things as they come. It was also written as a bit of a autobiographical thing, describing how the guys in Dream Theater felt about all that was going on in their lives. <br />\\"Surrounded\\": A five-and-a-half minute work of absolute art! The first thing I noticed about this song is the synthesizer line taken from the Styx song \\"Loreli\\", that opens this song. There's just so much to love about this song, it's nearly impossible to describe! However, it's the perfect type of song to end your night listening to before you go to sleep. Lyrically, it seems to talk about refreshing your spirit, but I can't say too specifically the meaning of all the lyrics. However, this song will prove to be absolutely magnificent, along with all the others! <br />\\"Metropolis, Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper\\": A preview to the '99 album, \\"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory\\". However, without delving too deeply into that, I'll describe this song. First off, it's one of the greatest metal songs of all time, period. It has that certain atmosphere, hard to describe what it is, but the opening, keyboard work gives you that feel that something great is about to approach. Then comes in John Petrucci's monstrous, chugging riffs, Mike's drums slam into it, and the whole song explodes into a nine and a half minute musical treasure! Musical chops all over the place, dramatic use of vocals, it paints such an interesting scene that you really want to know more about. It seems to go on and on like a road filled with fantastic journeys, because, well, that's what this album is. On that note, you might wanna check out, \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" to conclude this amazing tale. What a rocker this thing is, and completely artistic at the same time! <br />\\"Under A Glass Moon\\": This is one of my favorite songs on the album. Well, that's a bit of an ironic statement, because I absolutely adore all songs on this epic piece of art. Anyway, the opening chord progression gives the song a very night-time atmospheric feel to it, just so incredible. Then the rest of the song comes in and another great work is born! I especially love the part of the song where the drums speed up and James sings, \\"Outside the soundness of your mind/ Bathing your soul in silver tears/ Beneath a blackened, summer sky/ Praying for time to disappear\\". Oooh, the combination of the music and James' voice just sends a feeling to you that makes you grasp the huge proportions of it all. This seven-minute wonder has an enormous feel to it, and contains a stupendously awesome guitar solo by John Petrucci. I can't believe the critics at, I believe Rolling Stone, put it at #98 (but then again, these are the same critics at listed Eddie Van Halen at #70 of the greatest rock guitarists). Anyway, this song totally rocks, I mean, you can just feel John Petrucci GRIND out that guitar work, SHRED out those solos. The practically overwhelming experience of this, after \\"Metropolis, Part 1\\", is sure to deliver sixteen and a half minute of undoubted bliss. And, to some extent, this is a religious song, like \\"Surrounded\\". It seems as though somebody has died and they are going to heaven, hence the lyric, \\"Night awaits the lamb's arrival\\" and \\"By your hand, I've awakened/ Bear this honor in my name\\". <br />\\"Wait For Sleep\\": A two and a half minute ballad completely written by Kevin Moore, about a female friend of his who felt a bit empty inside and needed something good to believe in. The haunting, yet romantic piano line perfect accompanies the incoming string section, and James adds a bounce with his vocal rhythm that incorporates an even greater feel to the song. <br />\\"Learning To Live\\": Ahhh, the closer of a dynamic album, and at eleven and a half minutes, it's sure to last. The keyboards open, the instruments progress, and James tells the tale of, in my opinion and the opinions of others, learning to live with AIDS. This song may also just mean living with the everyday troubles life gives you, but lines like, \\"The 90s bring new questions/ New solutions to be found/ I fell in love to be let down\\", and \\"Once you're touched you stand alone/ To face the bitter fight/ Once I reached for love/ And now I reach for life\\". In all honesty, it's a sad topic, but it's delivered in such a beautiful way, this song, though it may actually drag on in some areas, is just dynamic and is a great way to end an album on this level. <br /> <br />The great thing about \\"Images and Words\\" is that it brings out my reflective, sensetive side, while still being able to also draw out the side of me that can listen to an eight-minute rocker. It explores different emotions with different approaches, yet Dream Theater has a very noticeable style that sticks out when compared to other bands of their (slightly recent) time frame. There's a lot to love about this album, A LOT, I mean it. I don't know if any reviews can cover the vastness this album covers, but I did my best to describe with a leviathan of a musical masterpiece \\"Images and Words\\" is. There's really no other album like it, so if you get, and I really hope you do, cherish it for what it is, all the beauty in the images (album booklet) and words (the music itself), and together, how it paints such a stunning picture. <br /> <br />If you like music with incredible talent, deep, epic meaning and the power of, say, a modified Rush, \\"Images and Words\\" may just be that album. It seems to be just so much to describe, but I, both as a musician and a music-lover (and I can say that I've heard quite a few acts out there), I give kudos to this album without a doubt, as it is truly worthy of a five-star rating. For your enjoyment, get this, as I know you'll love it as much as I do.

B000MXPE7Y|2.0|Robert De Niro's extraordinary talents as an actor need no elaboration here. With regard to De Niro's  abilities as director, it is useful to compare A Bronx Tale, his last effort in 1993 with The Good Shepherd, his second film. The former displays evidence of masterly and imaginative directorial gifts that brought to life a story replete with power, violence, poignancy, insight and humor.  The success of A Bronx Tale would emerge from out of the matrix of De Niro's immensely successful association with Martin Scorsese and from actor/writer Chaz Palmieri's wonderful screenplay.  Throughout A Bronx Tale, De Niro displayed what seemed to be an innate and thorough grasp of  New York's organized crime scene.     In disappointing contrast, The Good Shepherd stands as a pretentious and  insipid film. Dark and complex aspects of CIA operations worldwide are either treated superficially or are totally obfuscated. On the surface, the premise of The Good Shepherd suggests a work poised to deliver a timely and provocative look at America's foreign policy in the post World War II era, one spanning several decades that focuses upon the conduct of CIA operations worldwide. Matt Damon is Edward Wilson, a dull Yale Skull and Crossbones alumnus recruited by CIA founder William Donovan and played by De Niro. Angelina Jolie plays Clover, Wilson's beautiful and frustrated wife. Alec Baldwin and William Hurt deliver fine performances as does Joe Peschi - whom we encounter very briefly and memorably (as in A Bronx Tale) playing mobster Joseph Palmi.     DeNiro uses flashbacks throughout the film in a manner that irritates and confuses. As the film's screenwriter, Eric Roth,(whose earlier works include Forest Gump and Munich), delivers a sanitized and vapid script that fails to shed light on critical events and issues underlying US policy worldwide. For example, in mentioning the CIA coup in Guatemala, Roth completely ignores the role played by corporate interests such as United Fruit, (now Chiquita Brands International). As men with strong links to United Fruit, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and CIA Director Allen Dulles supported plans for a coup that overthrew the democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz who sought to nationalize lands held by United Fruit. In the process, America devastated Guatemala's hope of securing a future based on justice and progress. Roth's screenplay adopts the fiction claimed by the Eisenhower administration in 1954 that Arbenz served as an agent of Soviet-styled communism and therefore his removal was essential to the national security of the United States.  In no part of this film do we see evidence of the integration of vital literature pertaining to CIA global actions such as Miles Copeland's The Game of Nations, William Crane Eveland's Ropes of Sand, Phillip Agee's Inside the Company or John Stockwell's In Search of Enemies. Roth does refer to certain aspects of  America's Bay of Pigs fiasco, but affords us so little  historical information about the subject that we are unable to analyze it in an informed and critical way.        In assessing The Good Shepherd, one should bear in mind  Samuel Johnson's wise adage that \\"patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.\\" In The Good Shepherd - Edward Wilson -  emerges in the Roth script as an unfortunate and bland global automaton who clings to career and class while placing considerations of state interest far above that of family.  Like a character in a Sinclair Lewis novel, he remains oblivious to the moral conundrums inherent in the implementation of CIA policies.     Sadly, we are afforded so little information pertaining to critical issues, events, countries, people, and corporations  that a true philosophical quandary involving the main character and the goals he pursues never emerges. And the script contains none of the depth or insight of a Sinclair Lewis novel. Alas, in the final analysis, we care very little about Wilson and all we are left withis a disjointed glimpse into the life of a global functionary who is devoid of soul, and we are none the better for having made such a pointless journey.

0345451325|5.0|I'm one of the few people who is decidedly NOT a fan of the Halo video games, although I did buy Halo 2 when it first came out.  I simply never got into  playing it, and never understood what all the fuss was about.  However, I still wound up picking up the book on a friend's recommendation and I have to admit: after reading and really liking the book, I will probably go back and play through the Halo games. <br /> <br />This is an excellent work of science fiction, taken on it's own.   I never played the first Halo game, but you can still get into this book without any primer or backstory.  Also, the action is literally non-stop, with all kinds of ground combat as well as space battles between ships.  These become games of chess, as the humans have to be clever to outwit their more technologically advanced alien enemy, the Covenant.  The characters are all extremely memorable, and not just the main character, John.  There's also Captain Keyes, Dr. Halsey, and Admiral Stanforth.  The hologram Artificial Intelligence named Cortana, in particular, has a big personality that jumps off the page at you.  <br /> <br />The storyline does bounce around chronologically, but it's never difficult to follow.  It begins in the year 2535 as the humans try to defend the planet Jericho VII from the Covenant.  We then rewind to 2517, which starts with the history behind the \\"Master Chief\\" and how he was trained from a child.  We're taken through boot camp and his \\"augmentation\\" to become almost super-human.  Adding the MJOLNIR combat armor later on just adds to their coolness.  The story concludes with the epic battle to defend the surprise attack against the planet Reach.  The title of the book spoils how that turns out. <br /> <br />Flaws?  I would say the descriptions of the aliens aren't deep enough - Grunts, Jackals, Elites, the scientist thing with tentacles, and the giant alien from Sigma Octanus IV.  You don't get a good sense for what they actually look like.  I caught a couple typos, but they're pretty minor. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"The Fall of Reach\\" is a very entertaining read that I was pleasantly surprised by.  I will definitely be reading the rest of the books in this series: \\"First Strike\\" and \\"The Flood.\\"
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I recently purchased this CD and am absolutely blown away by this incredibly beautiful music.  I'm overwhelmed by the emotions evoked by the harmonic and melodic aspects of this genre.  It is so moving and just heavenly.  If you feel deeply and appreciate the angelic and emotional nature of music, you will love this CD.  I just purchased four additional CD's by the various women Celtic musicians featured on this CD.  I have such a deep love and appreciation for Celtic music.  Enjoy!
B000PFUAO6|5.0|So, after reading numerous terrible reviews of this album, I was wary to buy it at all. But, being the devoted DT fan that I am, you know I did buy the thing! I have listened to this record more times than I can count now and I cannot see why the fans wouldn't like this record. It's got the heart, intensity and technicality that we all have come to love about this band. Plus, if you thought this record was \\"too technical\\" you're probably not even a DT fan to begin with because ALL of their records were technical to certain extent (some more than others)<br /><br />Album Rundown:<br /><br />In The Presence of Enemies Pt. 1: 10/10 - This is a great opener with more technicality than I have seen from this band in the past! Thoroughly enjoyable solos and the song as a whole just kicks you in the face!<br /><br />Forsaken: 10/10 - I thought this song was close to perfection. I love the melody and the awesome atmosphere the keyboard brings to this song!<br /><br />Constant Motion: 8/10 - The only reason this one got 8/10 is because of the blatant Metallica reference in the verse. I listen to this one for the break in the song...it is amazing!<br /><br />Dark Eternal Night: 10/10 - This song is undeniably the best \\"Metal\\" song that Dream Theater has come out with. But, they did not sacrifice that complicated essence in the break. The keyboard is reminiscent of \\"Dance of Eternity.\\"<br /><br />Repentance: 9/10 - This is a nice song if approached the right way but after two ripping songs like \\"Constant Motion\\" and \\"Dark Eternal Night,\\" this song came off as a bit weak. That's a shame because the lyrics are so heart-felt and the subject matter is so serious. I would say listen to this one before the two ahead of it.<br /><br />Prophets of War: 10/10 - A disco song?! Well, somehow it worked. It probably worked because they didn't do that intro through the entire song. Overall, the song is powerful and definitely one of the best on the record.<br /><br />Ministry of Lost Souls: 9/10 - This is a great song with an AMAZING break in it. But, the chorus (if you want to call it that) was a bit underdeveloped I felt. This is the first real epic of the album. It is a good listen, but lacked focus.<br /><br />In The Presence of Enemies Pt. 2: 10/10 - This is the song that really showcases the talent that this band possesses. Clocking in a over 16 minutes, it takes you on a journey through beautiful melodies and ripping guitars and eventually sets you down for the album's conclusion!of Lost Souls: 9/10 - This is a great song with an AMAZING break in it.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I own several Jane Eyre versions, liking them all, but only loving 2 - this one and the Timothy Dalton one - I do think the T.D. one is better, overall, because it's longer and they say it is closer to the book, in addition to T.D. being a very handsome & charming man.   <br /> <br />But, no other Jane Eyre, including Timothy's, leaves me breathless like this one does!  Toby Stephens is luscious as Edward Fairfax Rochester.  A very handsome actor, and a very good one, he is!  The funny thing about these Rochesters is that Rochester is supposed to be ugly - but nothing is farther from the truth where T.D. & T.S. are concerned!  So, this one gets 5 stars because Toby's Rochester has a way of igniting a fire in me like no other Rochester before him.  On the 1-10 scale, this is a 15 for me :)
B0001XAPZ6|2.0|I love Miyazaki's films. I own Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke, and Kiki's Delivery Service. I love them all. So I thought to complete the collection I would get Nausicaa (and of course the other two eventually). However, when I watched Nausicaa, from the first 20 minutes, mostly from when I saw her nude to the end of the movie, I was bored. I tried to like it but it made little sense to me. I liked the graphics and I liked the main theme of music. But the other music was kind of weird. I felt like I was listening to an 80's music theme. I didn't feel like I could connect with the characters and they all seemed flawed. I would suggest at least renting this one first, but I am glad I bought it anyway because I want the whole collection of Miyazaki's movies. I'll just say it was an early anime when he started out. I'm not trying to bash this film, I just simply didn't like it that much. And I probably wouldn't watch it again.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has to be the least understood band on the planet. I've always resisted Tool because of their fanatical following. It's been my experience that bands with rabid fans are either overhyped disasters (linkin park and a couple of EMO bands come to mind) or brilliant (Zep, smiths, radiohead etc).I figured I had a fifty/fifty shot. I put my predjudice aside and was blown away by the staggering power and beauty of 10,000 Days. The first thing that jumps out at you is the intensity of the players (Danny Carey,Justin Chancellor, Maynard James Keenan, Adam Jones). The music --much like Coltrane era jazz and seventies era prog rock-- transports your mind to an alternate reality. Carey's complex drumming is somehow taut/tight and loose at the same time. Chancellor and Jone's bass and guitar careen in and out the mix in hypnotic fashion. Keenon's lyrics and vocal command are perhaps unmatched in music today. The Pot and Vicarious are powerhouse rock songs. Wings for marie and 10,000 Days(wings pt.2) are epic. Led Zeppelin had an album called Presence; Tool is loaded with it. Tool makes most other bands/music sound like kid's stuff. Tool's music is darkly profound and challenging (no quick fixes here). There's a reason why they have fans who range from introspective teens to productive adult professionals. No, I wasn't abducted by the Tool \\"cult\\". The truth is out there... Give Tool seventy plus minutes and search for it. You just may find what you're looking for. Lateralus, here I come...
B000063DFN|5.0|Don't listen to the people who say Number of the Beast is better, because i think this is their best album. I know exactly what the worst song probably is, but even that is good. <br /> <br />1. Aces High: An excellent opener, and a bit unusual to have a 20th century song. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. 2 Minutes to Midnight: The song that i cant stop singing whenever i hear it. Awesome lyrics and intro, plus chorus. One of the world's best songs. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Losfer words: Somehow the guitaring sounds somewhat like the f-zero soundtrack. Nonetheless, a good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />4. Flash of the Blade: Not a favourite of mine, but still good. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />5. The Duellists: The highlight of this track is the chorus and the lyrics. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. Back in the Village: The worst song, but still good anyway. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />7. Powerslave: This is a very strange song which ive never seen anything like before. But i like it a lot, even if it is very long. 9/10 <br /> <br />8. Rime of the Ancient mariner: Longest ever song from iron maiden, but what if it is? The song is still brilliant and shouldnt be underrated. 10/10. <br /> <br />UP THE IRONS!
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Well Done Rihanna: This would have to be the best dance album of the summer so far by an artist. It has exceptional dance tracks and pulsating vibes throughout; with nice ballads too. Rihanna's previous albums (Music Of The Sun & A Girl Like Me) were good, solid albums and each one became more successful than the one before it. But Rihanna's third effort, Good Girl Gone Bad, (Her 3rd Album in LESS THAN 3 years!) would have to be the strongest. This album is filled with little gems, whereas her first two albums were only sprinkled with a few gems. This album as also made me a bigger fan than what I already am. *Plus* the art work is amazingly clevor, and she's so beautiful. Overall I give it a 4.5 rating, but you might as well round it up to a 5 star rating. (And I wouldn't be writing this long review if I really didnt like this album.)<br /><br />In 2005 we had Madonna's \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor.\\"<br /><br />In 2006 we had Nelly Furtado's \\"Loose.\\"<br /><br />And so far in 2007 we have Ms. Rihanna's \\"Good Girl Gone Bad.\\"<br /><br />Here's a breakdown of the album's tracks:<br /><br />1. Umbrella feat. JAY-Z: This song is everywhere and I'm sure that you have heard it. #1 all over billboard and other such charts and #1 on video countdowns. One of the best songs of the album, but there really is no need for Jay-Z in my opinion. Wonderful. (5/5)<br /><br />2. Push Up On Me: This is a sexy song and shows Rihanna's naughty side. This song also has a great chorus and gets stuck in your head easily. Love It! She \\"is\\" a good girl gone bad. (4.5/5)<br /><br />3. Don't Stop The Music: This song is my favorite off of the entire album. It is very electonic and has amazing beats + lyrics. It's def. in the early stages of electronica/dance and I bet remixes would make this song even stronger. This song also tells a story: she's obviously at a club and she sees someone on the dance floor, and after that... its pure bliss and dance. \\"... please don't stop the, please dont stop the, please don't stop the music ...\\" This song HAS to be a single (5/5)<br /><br />4. Breakin' Dishes: This song reminds me of Beyonce's \\"RING THE ALARM.\\" Rihanna wants revenge on her boyfriend. You better watch your back, because I've never sceen this side of her before. \\"She's A Fighter Man\\" (4.5/5)<br /><br />5. Shut Up and Drive: This song has some rock and dance beats incorporated into it. It is not my favorite song off of the album, but it's still an okay song for me. (3.5/5)<br /><br />6. Hate That I Love You feat. Ne-Yo: The album slows down into its first ballad. It's a really good song and will def. be a single, without a doubt. I hate how you have to stop dancing, and then slow down, :D but I really do like this song. It's really bittersweet. Very well done. Rihanna and Ne-Yo make really good music together. (5/5)<br /><br />7. Say It: I didn't like this song at first, but it grew on me alot. It's a nice way to ask someone out I think. It's slow but has more dance than the prevoius song. (4/5)<br /><br />8. Sell Me Candy: I love this song. It's so catchy and the lyrics are clevor and sexy and fun all at the same time. Rihanna's voice is different in this song as well; back to her reggae roots. (4.5/5)<br /><br />9. Lemme Get That: This is a good transition from the previous. \\"Why spend mine, when I can spend yours.\\" It's just okay for me. (4/5)<br /><br />10. Rehab: The second ballad off of the album. It's really good and this song also tells a story and is more than what I expected. Very Good! \\"You were my favorite drug...\\" (4.5/5)<br /><br />11. Question Existing: I love the title of this song and the beat to this slow ballad is very good. This song is probably the deepest and closest to Rihanna. I really enjoyed this song. (4.5/5)<br /><br />12. Good Girl Gone Bad: And finally, what the album is named after. I guess I can see why she named it after this song. This song is all about girl power... \\"and once a good girl goes bad, we gone forever...\\" (3.5/5)<br /><br />2007 BELONGS TO RIHANNA!
B0008ENHTE|5.0|This film demonstrates to contemporary Hollywood just how to make a superb thriller without having an explosion every 5 minutes. You know its a classic from the opening shot. Lalo Schifrin's insistent theme kicks in over the credits and the rollercoaster ride starts.<br /><br />McQueen is marvellous as a Frank Bullitt a no-nonsense, and somewhat rebellious detective who is having no truck with authority. Robert Vaughn, who I've always liked, but never really rated as an actor, is excellent here as Walter Charmers (who is anything but charming!). The scenes between him and McQueen are riveting. Theres the famous car chase of course, which is great, but watching it again recently, the thing that struck me was the completely realistic Hospital scenes. Its all very clinical if you'll excuse the pun.<br /><br />On disc 1:<br /><br />There is a commentary by the directory Peter Hyams and a trailer.<br /><br />On Disc 2:<br /><br />Documentary 1 'The Cutting Edge: The Magic Of Movie Editing' narrated by Kathy Bates<br /><br />Documentary 2 'Steve McQueen: The Essence Of Cool' a film about McQueen.<br /><br />3 'Bullitt: Steve McQueen's Commitment To Reality'.<br /><br />Of the extras the commentary is probably the best bit, but the film itself is reason alone to buy these discs.
B000O178BY|3.0|\\"with teeth\\" was a fairly disappointing album by NIN standards.  though it had its bright spots, as a whole it was disposable and forgettable.  i'm sad to say that \\"year zero\\" doesn't really change that, and in fact is probably worse than \\"with teeth.\\"     the first problem is that all the songs sound basically the same.  this is a problem NIN has never had.  even \\"pretty hate machine\\" had plenty of variety.  yes, i know trent & company are going for a theme in this album and they purposely made the songs sound similar.  the problem is, no song stands out.  looking at the song titles, it's hard for me to even remember what some songs sound like, because they all sound so much alike.    the second problem is the lyrics.  now i don't think any of us NIN fans expect incredible poetry out of trent reznor.  it just isn't in his makeup exactly.  but compare the lyrics of \\"the downward spiral\\" to his lyrics now ..  the lyrics of songs like heresy, march of the pigs, closer, and the becoming were genius.  now?  hmm... not so much.  many of the lyrics are of such an uncreative nature, it brings the song down.  even though there are lots of \\"sick beats\\" on \\"year zero,\\" forgettable lyrics tend to make a song forgettable.    the third problem is, NIN's music has lost its visceral emotional edge.  on songs like \\"march of the pigs\\" and \\"closer,\\" trent was practically breathing fire.  now?  it's more like he's bitching about the newspaper.  yes, we're all mad about the politics of today..  but reznor doesn't strike the same political/emotional chord that zack de la rocha from rage against the machine managed to tap.  instead of angry, the songs tend to sound whiny.    the fourth problem is, reznor can't get over this idea that NIN music has to sound angry.  in truth, the truly bright, memorable spots in \\"year zero\\" are the QUIET moments, meaning \\"another version of the truth\\" and \\"in this twilight.\\"  the two exceptions to this are \\"capital G,\\" where trent manages to make it fun tobe a smartass about our president, and \\"god-given,\\" where he snarkily takes the first-person of self-righteous right-wingers with fun lyrics like \\"i'm afraid we're gonna ask you to leave.  guess you cannot win with the color of your skin, you won't be getting in to the promised land\\" set to sexy beats reminescent of the \\"money money money\\" theme song from \\"the apprentice\\"!      the fifth problem is, trent's method to music has changed.  i'm not sure if this will end up being a positive or negative thing.  trent's old approach to music was to meticulously craft his music as a loner in the studio, taking years.  after \\"the fragile,\\" it seems like he's gone the other direction, quickly churning out music as part of his new band.   the good thing is that his new band is very capable and talented.  the bad thing is that the quality of the songs and lyrics seems to suffer.       while \\"year zero\\" may very well whet your appetite for some music chronicling the political frustration of today, if you're like me you'll find yourself going back to TDS, and listening to some good ol' radiohead for your politically-oriented music.      on a good note, \\"year zero\\" does manage to capture the general frustration of at least one age demographic with the current condition of america.  while this view may seem insular to trent himself, i think quite a few people can actually relate to trent's anger/sadness with the state of america today.  to capture that in song is fairly remarkable.
B00002EPJH|5.0|This solo Piano album from Keith Jarrett is another reminder of the mans remarkable talents. As can be seen from the track listing these are all standards and Jarrett plays them as I have never heard him play before or since. These renditions are almost like recitals. I don't know how much improvisation there is on this album, but I suspect it is less than usual. The reason for this is that the recordings were the first he made during his recovery from the debilitating illness he suffered in the mid 1990's. In fact initially they were recorded only for his Wife and not neccessarily for commercial release.<br /><br />Jarretts beautiful touch, phrasing and occasionally, such as on \\"I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good\\" his marvellous improvising skills are demonstrated to great effect. Really writing about this is futile, to appreciate this great album you need to listen to it.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|The more I listen to this album, the more I LOVE it. <br /> <br />A lot of the songs off this album just keep playing over and over in my head. And, I am not sick of it. That way, I know this is a great album. It's NO surprise 'Umbrella' is country's #1 song right now, it's certainly one the BEST song I've heard this year.  <br /> <br />Great beat, sexy and playful voice is just ALL over this album. Her Pop-Rock-R&B-Hip-hop-Dance-Caribbean flavor is very pleasant and wonderful in my ears. As these are pretty much my favorite genres. <br /> <br />It's a shame there is no bonus remix CD like the UK did, or music Video for Umbrella, etc. So, I hope in the near future, they will release such Deluxe edition and I will gladly buy it. <br /> <br />I am more fan of Rihanna than ever, and I certainly consider her a Rising star to watch in the future, for sure. Like other great female singers -Mariah Carey, Beyonce, Ciara, Rihanna is another singer I must keep updated from now on. I know her next album is going to be much better.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I am a little surprised at this grouping of negative reviews with one star. While some of these negative reviews have some valid points, like with having to operate with such a small budget - Rob Thomas did have to use only a few regulars at time to save money and there was only one moment that I agree that was a little awkward for a daughter to be joking with her dad about (it involves a scene where Veronica is giving her dad a hard time about putting on his old sheriff uniform - saying it look like he was going out to do a strip show for a party) but even this moment wasn't that bad and the whole season was definitely not ruining the Keith/Veronica relationship with inappropriate moments. And I do agree that this season was different from the other two, I thought it had a little too much back-and-forth Logan and Veronica relationship drama and Piz & Parker were never really all that interesting additions to the cast. This did make me feel that this third season was not quite as good as the first two, I agree with an earlier reviewer that network interference seem to be at the heart of these bad changes to the VM formula (the season long mystery arc should of stayed in tack and it should of been \\"The Castle\\" (a mystery only introduced in the last two finale episodes)). But in the end, these negative reviews are mostly over-the-top, exaggerated, and giving this season only one star - that's seriously too harsh (I could be convinced of it being valid to give it 3 or 4 stars but since so many people have committed this atrocity of only giving it one star, I am whole-heartedly giving it 5 stars because I still enjoyed VM that much!).    I love this show immensely and explaining why the first two seasons are so great has already been well covered, so I will skip that. This third season still had plenty of witty-dialogue and winning moments! And for VM fans who didn't watch the last 2 episodes of this third season - you really missed out!! I think Rob Thomas finally fought to get the show back to his original vision and these last 2 episodes were absolutely great!!!  I will end with this reviewer, Karla Peterson's, nice summary of these last 2 episodes of the third season:     [...]    Considering that the only end that would please the Veronica faithful would be no end at all EVER, this ending was good enough for me because it came after nearly two hours of the stuff that has always made the show so special. There was great, snappy dialogue that managed to name-check Lionel Richie and Sylvia Plath. There were blazing acting fireworks from the entire cast. There was the jackass piñata. Best of all, there were the friends that have always been Veronica's ace in the crime-fighting hole. There was bad-boy Weevil providing tire-jacking services; brainy Mac with her computer skills and gal-pal advice; and loyal Wallace being there no matter what. Freezing butt and all. Everybody was there doing what they do best, and our Veronica was doing her good-hearted, strong-willed best to show why she deserved them. Throw in that last, unbearably sweet father-daughter supper, and you had a finale that gave us plenty of comfort-TV when we needed it most.

B000NDI3SK|5.0|If you can afford this DVD series, buy it, as it is the finest presentation of the history of humankind ever produced.  By history I do not mean the political, but rather that biological and cultural history which makes us unique masters of our surroundings.       Dr. Browowski was a world famous math professor who knew and worked with most all of the major physicists and scientists of the 20th Century.  His best friend was Leo Slizard, considered by many the father of nuclear fission.       This series is monumental in the history of science and understanding us.  It presents Dr. Browowski's personal views upon why we as a biological species have achieved the heights we find ourselves, and the grandeur and beauty of humankind. His passion for the human species is both profound and nearly spiritual.       I first saw it when it came out on PBS in the 1970's. I copied it on my early Beta format VCR in the very late 1970's, which I still have.  It still plays at perfect resolution, much better than the VHS format. Have not yet seen this series on the DVD, but am going to buy it as soon as I can afford it. At over $100.00 it is no bargain, but well worth it as an investment in an historic and very early science series.

0307120007|5.0|My 2 year old daughter has so many books which incorporate different textures to touch and flaps to lift and look underneath. When her Grandad gave her this book I thought that I would appreciate it more than her because of the sentimental value of it being such an old book. I thought my daughter would be less interested because it doesn't have the flashy colourful pictures of her more modern books.  <br /> <br />I was so wrong. Out of all her touch and feel books, it is repeatedly this one that she looks for in her book box. <br /> <br />I think the difference with this book, and no doubt why it has been loved by so many generations, is that my daughter doesn't just touch - she actively joins in a whole range of activities with the children in the story. She strokes the bunny, plays peek-a-boo, smells the (very perfumed!) flowers, reads the book, looks in the mirror, and her favourites - stroking Daddy's scratchy face and putting on Mummy's ring. It is a story about child's play and a child's view of the world, and the not so flashy drawings do in fact add to that.
0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah delivers the bone-chilling story of his lost childhood in Sierra Leon. As others have said, this book was almost painful to read as the truths of war and corruption in Africa are brought sharply into focus. As you tumble down the proverbial rabbit hole with Ishmael's childhood, truths unfold into a story that will leave you stunned and perhaps saddened.<br /><br />The story that Ishmael delivers is very much the same as we've heard in the news; children who have lost their families and friends to war are recruited into rebel forces or local militia in order to 'fight the good fight'. What we don't hear in the news is how these children can, and will, be rehabilitated. Ishmael Beah is proof of that. The account of Ishmael's life is heartbreaking and when reading you almost feel as if you're going through his childhood with him, at his side. His pain is your pain as he battles emotional trauma, loneliness, drug addiction, physical injury and post traumatic stress.<br /><br />As I read this book I was initially horrified by the images that Ishmael manages to portray through his brilliant writing effort. I found it hard to sleep with these images still in my mind wondering  'What can we do to help these chilren? These people? All those families?'. Ishmael Beah makes a brilliant effort in educating the audience about just how pressing these matters are and his writing, in essence, is a first step in educating people on the cold hard facts.<br /><br />Beah's storytelling ability amazed me. This book was captivating from the very first lines and I found myself unable to put it down. It's a brilliant work about one child, in many, that fought their way back from the front lines. I have utmost respect for the author for being brave enough to share his story, as it surely must have been a difficult feat. It's a book I would recommend to anyone. The first steps in helping children like Ishmael is educating yourselves on the truths that unfold in this work. He is one voice, in hundreds (perhaps thousands), that shared his experience to bring forth awareness.<br /><br />Beautifully written and heart-wrenching, it's worth all five stars and then some. If you have the chance to pick up \\"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier\\", do so. You won't be disappointed.He is one voice, in hundreds (perhaps thousands), that shared his experience to bring forth awareness.  <br /> <br />Beautifully written and heart-wrenching, it's worth all five stars and then some.

0060207051|5.0|My 2 year old daughter was given this book by her Grandad, and it has become an integral part of the bed-time routine. Every night I read her a couple of other stories and then she asks for 'Moon'. She settles down in her bed, just like the rabbit, and points to everything that is mentioned in the story, counting the three little bears sitting on chairs and the two kittens. She then waves goodnight to everything and whispers \\"hush\\" with the little old lady. By the end of the story the gentle wording has lulled her so that her eyes are heavy and she easily sleeps. <br /> <br />I love this book, because with it my daughter and I share something special every night that parents and children have shared together for generations. It is a timeless classic because it understands how children see the world.

0743496728|5.0|Jodi Picoult does not write for those who want nice, neat solutions to difficult and challenging issues.<br /><br />In this novel, the reader is invited to explore the feelings of those impacted whether directly or indirectly by the events described.  And who can fail to be affected?  We have all been students.  At different times we may have been bullied, or have been the bully. Some of us can identify with a number of the roles portrayed by the characters.  We are each human and we will each react to the story told by Ms Picoult in our own way in the light of our own experiences.<br /><br />Why read this novel?<br /><br />Because the novel itself invites the reader to examine the issues from a number of different perspectives without excusing or apologising for any.<br /><br />Because understanding, or seeking to understand, the dynamics of belonging and the isolation of exclusion may give some insight which could prevent some future tragedy.<br /><br />Because we owe it to ourselves, to our children and to our societies to try to understand the pressures of their lives.<br /><br />Just because.<br /><br />This novel invites readers to think about these issues while at the same time providing a good, well-developed story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />'When you look into your baby's eyes,' Lacy said softly,' you see everything you hope they can be ... not everything you wish they won't become.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith

Amazon had graciously sent a replacement set that had the same 4086 4203 error code, and Warner Brothers just sent a mailer for me to get yet another set from them.  However the ultimate fix was getting the firmware updated in my Toshiba HD-A20 player.  Al HD-DVDs now play fine.  I'm bumping the stars up to 5.

0060853980|5.0|Admittedly, I am a Terry Pratchett fanatic, and, at times, a lesser fan of Neil Gaimon.  American Gods did nothing for me, but his young peoples' books and, of course, the Sandman, are classics.  However, who knew that this odd couple of writers could produce the most amusing deconstruction of religion, the Apocalypse, and modern life and its slow death of the soul?  They have melded their styles and their humor -- and their considerable educations, into a seamless retelling of the end of the world, skewering by implication all the \\"rapture\\" loonies as well as anyone who has had to deal with telemarketers, 11 year olds, nosy neighbors, oblivious and ordinary folks, and conspiracy die-hards.There is no fan club presently for the two angels involved: there ought to be. I buy this book in quantity for gifts.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|It's really hard to put Sufjan's music into a category.  I suppose folk music is close - but it has a unique cadence which is hard to really define.  This is perhaps why I love this music so much.  Sufjan's voice is incredibly sweet and clear, and the music is gentle without ever once being insipid or dull.  The blend of instruments at times creates an almost magical feel - banjo, oboe, strings, horn.  The chorus of voices on some of the tracks is also clear and cool, as in \\"They are the Night Zombies.\\"<br /><br />This album is dedicated to the state of Illinois, and there has also been one of Michigan.  I guess it was probably too ambitious to do one for each state, and I think he has abandoned that idea - but the concept works well on this one.  It has a city feel and there is a twinge of nostalgia in some of the songs.  Mostly, however, the lyrics are unsentimental but thoughtful.<br /><br />This is the kind of music to listen to late at night, or early in the morning when you get up and are fixing a cup of coffee.  It goes with the chirping of crickets, or the early morning twitter of birds.  Relax and enjoy it - it is therapeutic.  I found it inspiring and would highly recommend it.

B00000ING2|5.0|I cannot say enough about this movie, and, after seeing it for the third time, I remain amazed by the skill and power of the Coen brothers. That they were able to put together a master plot while making every subfacet and tertiary character of this film incredibly interesting is nothing short of astounding. The Hudsucker Proxy is a flawless work of art that cannot be confused with real life. Many of its elements are wonderfully overstated and some of its sequences need to be replayed several times in order to grasp their grandeur--in particular, the scene in which Robbins is promoted from the mailroom in which everyone's laughs continuously and uncontrollably. That was an incredible clip and I think I'll view it again after writing this. Furthermore, Jennifer Jason Leigh's accent is priceless as is the send up of the old school newsroom. As for Newman, well he's Newman so nothing more needs to be said. Seeing this again reminded me that the Coens have more than one film I'd give 100 stars out of 100 to (Miller's Crossing). The Hudsucker Proxy is nothing short of spectacular.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|If there ever was a movie that should be seen for an astonishing performance by an actor, it's \\"Half Nelson\\" with Ryan Gosling.  The Canadian born Gosling, who co-starred in \\"The Notebook\\" with Rachel McAdams and made his debut on \\"The Mickey Mouse Club,\\" plays Dan Dunne, a history teacher in a Brooklyn junior high school.  Nominated for an Academy Award, Gosling brings incredible depth to the role of the troubled teacher with a cocaine problem.<br /><br />When Dunne is not struggling with \\"crash and burn\\" in the harsh morning light of the classroom, he's hell-bent down the road of self-destruction.  Despite the double life, he is a good teacher who really does inspire his students.  He manages to bypass the regular curriculum by sharing his belief in Hegelian dialectics, the idea that history or change can only happen through opposing forces.  Watching Dunne make such enormous effort to put on a good face for his students is heart-rending.  It is impossible to witness his plight in the morning and not remember the worst hangover you ever had.<br /><br />The story starts moving in a new direction when 13-year-old Drey (Shareeka Epps) finds her history teacher on the restroom floor after a basketball game.  From then on, they forge a bond over the disclosure of his drug use, which he still tries to hide from her.  He starts driving her home after games and exchanging knowing looks with her on particularly bad mornings.<br /><br />Lest you think this turns into the tired formula of the forbidden teacher-student affair, let me stop you right there.  Director Ryan Fleck and co-writer/co-producer/editor Anna Boden sidestep the genres of romance and inspirational classroom fable, and create an entirely different story of redemption.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Drey develops a schoolgirl crush, while her teacher grows too protective of her, especially around her drug-dealing older friend Frank (Anthony Mackie).  We see the film cut back and forth between two scenes: Drey looking shyly at herself in the mirror during a moment of sexual awakening and Dunne in the throes of a careless, drug-enhanced sexual encounter with another teacher.<br /><br />Teacher and student are from different worlds, but each stands at the crossroads in their lives.  The filmmakers honor this experience between the two without exploitation or spending too much time discussing right or wrong.  Neither character is assigned the role as the main catalyst for the change brewing in their lives, but the simple friendship between teacher and student brings healing and transformation.rey looking shyly at herself in the mirror during a moment of sexual awakening and Dunne in the throes of a careless, drug-enhanced sexual encounter with another teacher.<br /><br />Teacher and student are from different worlds, but each stands at the crossroads in their lives.

B00004Y6NK|3.0|I love the song, \\"Its In The Way That You Use It\\", and there are a couple of other good ones on the CD, and some good solos.  Overall, though, this CD sounds too much like Phil Collins for my taste.  I like the tone of Eric's guitar and his licks are great, but I prefer it when he does things his own way.

B000002OX7|5.0|The Who's 1971 album Who's Next brought in a new era for The Who, and for rock music in general. A very personal album, the songs are introspective, adult, and hold back nothing, musically or lyrically. Other than the hilarious My Wife, these are not fun songs, they cover serious matters, in an earnest way. From the first verse in Baba O'Riley, \\"Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals\\", the songs signify a determined stuggle for survival. Bargain is a hard rocking tempest of immaculate longing.<br /><br />I'd gladly lose me to find you<br />I'd gladly give up all I had<br />To find you I'd suffer anything and be glad.<br /><br />The song's devotion is complete, unconditional, and cuts to the soul. It's one of The Who's best songs. Love Ain't For Keeping and Going Mobile highlight the band's acoustic side. One describes the urgency and uncertainty of love and the other is about a life on the road. The Song Is Over and Getting In Tune are both very good piano-based songs (Getting In Tune also rocks). The acoustic/electric, lonely and bitter Behind Blue Eyes is a pure classic from The Who and also one of their most popular songs. Without this, there would probably be no Metallica, no Staind, or any other angry metal music. We Don't Get Fooled Again is The Who's anthem, and it's cynical (but sadly, on target) view of the changes that were taking place in the world during the tumultuous 1960s and early 1970s. Musically, the song is a mighty force, with Pete Townsend's electric guitar power chords, an explosive Keith Moon drum assault during the extended, spacey instrumental break, and the longest, loudest screams in the history of recorded music from Roger Daltrey. Of course, \\"The Ox\\", John Entwistle, as always, brings it all together with his legendary bass guitar. This album changed the landscape, and the direction of rock music. A more powerful, masculine, and maturely introspective era of music soon followed. Who's Next is one of the greatest albums of all time, and it has had a profound effect on many people's lives in the world (including my own).und effect on many people's lives in the world (including my own).

0793518326|4.0|This book is awesome. People who give 1 star to this are obviously hard to satisfied and I wonder what have they found to be better than this great collection of REAL COMPLETE SCORES.  <br /> <br />Complete scores => you get much more than the damn exact copy of the melody for the right hand piano part. You get the bass lines, the guitar tabs, chords and solos, the exact (or almost exact) piano accompaniment, the vocal (including back vocals !), the main drum pattern and even the other non conventional instruments (harp, organ, strings, etc.).  <br /> <br />Sure, there are a few mistakes in this book. Most are very minor and are due to personal interpretation. Are can you build up a perfect score arrangement from old recordings like the Beatles albums ? There are so many subtilties in their music <br /> <br />PROS :  <br /> <br />-ALL the songs are there, even those not written by the Beatles. <br /> <br />-It is THE BEST Beatles score book available and as far as I know one of the only full score book existing for rock music.  <br /> <br />-ALL the instruments from EACH song are written, usually on different staves. <br /> <br />-It is a real treasure of great music, fun to play and great for band playing. <br /> <br /> <br />CONS : <br /> <br />-The high number of pages makes the book hard to hold on a stand when you are near the beginning or the end of the book. They should have made the pages full sized and less numerous. Because of this, you often have to \\"turn to the next page\\" to follow a score. <br /> <br />-Scores are written quite small. It is not a problem for me, but I guess it is a big one for a few people.  <br /> <br />-There are no tempo markings at the beginning of the songs. Most people know the songs very well before playing but this would ave been a great add-on. <br /> <br />-There are a few \\"big mistakes\\" as bad chords or missing accidentals, but you really have to search for them.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0374105235|5.0|This book nearly brought me to tears, and for a book, that is impressive. How anyone can have lived such a hard life and tell the story willingly is amazing to me. The book seemed to drift between emotional accounts of fleeing the rebels and losing friends and family to cold, nearly emotionless accounts of being a soldier. But! All was not lost as he was rescued and now, I assume, tells the story so that others may not have to suffer the same fate. Beah is a masterful storyteller, and a supreme advocate of why forced conscription of children should be purged from the human repertoire.  <br /> <br />I feel this book is almost necessary reading for anyone who wants a larger world view and who wants to be reminded as to why we should care what happens within and outside our country. It tells a cautionary tale, it tells of hope and rescue, and it tells of the power of caring. If the UN workers had not cared so much individually for their charges, who knows if we would have this book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The series are absolutely amazing! <br />A very educational program that completely blew me away. <br />It travels you to different sides of the world and to see not only the stunning ecological system, but also seeing fantastic animals. David Attenborough is definitely a very knowledgeable narrator! He accurately describe the behavior of particular species. I have to mention the effort of all those cameramen! They give us stunning picture like the Amur leopard, wild dogs, bizarre birds, e.t.c. Moreover, It opens my eyes in a sense that our world is in danger. I realize how human contact interrupt wild life's habitat.What a wonderful program!
B000BB14YY|5.0|Born in 1910 Japan, Akira Kurosawa first studied painting before moving into film in the late 1930s.  A well-known director in Japan throughout the 1940s, his 1950 production of RASHOMON launched him to international acclaim--and throughout the remainder of his long career he was widely acknowledged as among the world's greatest film directors, the creator of such films as THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD, and YOJIMBO.  Released in 1985, RAN would be among his final films and is generally felt to be among his finest.<br /><br />Kurosawa often borrowed plot lines from Western literature, and with RAN--the Japanese word translates loosely as chaos--he lifted the basic story from William Shakespeare's KING LEAR.  In Kurosawa's retelling, the Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) divides his kingdom between three sons: Taro (Akira Terao), Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu).  When youngest son Saburo upbraids his father for foolishness, Hidetora banishes him--only to find Taro and Jiro turning against him just as Saburo predicted.  Kurosawa shapes the Shakespearean story to 16th Century Japan, so it would be easy to belabor comparison with the original; at the same time, however, it is worth pointing out that he actually captures the story more effectively than any western filmmaker has to date.<br /><br />As in many Kurosawa films, RAN alternates moments of great stillness with rapacious action, enclosed spaces with wide vistas.  In stillness, the film focuses upon its actors and their intrigues--perhaps most notably the perfidious Lady Kaede, a truly dark character frighteningly realized by actress Mieko Harada.  Indeed, all the cast is remarkably fine.  But the great centerpiece, and the great performance, of the film is Tatsuya Nakadai's Lord Hidetora, whose mixture of good intention and folly leads first to humiliation and then to madness.  Perhaps the single most stunning moment of the film occurs when Hidetora, betrayed by his sons, walks down the tower steps of the third castle following a vicious battle.  It is difficult to imagine many actors who could perform such a scene; it is equally difficult to imagine many directors who could stage it.<br /><br />Few directors are able to convey the sense of chaos, destruction, and fear with which Kurosawa endows battle scenes, and RAN is no exception.  There are several, and the battle of the third castle (in which Hidetora is bested by sons Taro and Jiro) is easily among the finest battle sequences of Kurosawa's career.  Presented without any sound except a simple, eloquent music score, flash-cutting between different groups in the struggle, the result is a unique mixture of beauty and horror--and in my opinion unequaled by any other film I've seen.<br /><br />It should be noted that RAN, unlike RASHOMON, THRONE OF BLOOD, YOJIMBO and many other Kurosawa films, is in color.  I have long been used to the remarkable shading of Kurosawa's black and white films, and I missed it--but only for a moment.  Kurosawa proves no less adept in color than in black and white, and RAN's use of color is remarkable.  For this reason I particularly recommend the Criterion Collection edition of the film over any other; it is very fine.  But regardless of the particular version, this is a film which must be seen by any one who appreciates Asian or world cinema, truly a masterwork by a great master.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewertower steps of the third castle following a vicious battle.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|If there is any film that Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland will be remembered for (as screen partners) it's 'The Adventures of Robin Hood'. It has become one of the most beloved storybook films of all time--action, romance, majestic sets and music, a sparkling script with many juicy lines and all of the swashbuckling swordplay done with great flourish and style. The highlight of the many action scenes is the duel between Flynn and Rathbone as they overturn heavy tables and candelabra, all the while exchanging some blustery dialogue.<br /><br />As for Flynn and de Havilland, their screen chemistry was never more obvious. Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone make a memorable pair of villains and the remarkable cast includes sterling performances from Melville Cooper, Ian Hunter, Una O'Connor, Alan Hale, Eugene Palette, Montagu Love and Patric Knowles.<br /><br />It's a fairytale version all done up in gleaming technicolor, the action and romance made even more impressive by Korngold's exquisite Oscar-winning score. The romantic highlight is the scene in Marian's bedchamber, a Romeo-and-Juliet-like moment with Flynn climbing a vine to her balcony to woo his damsel in distress. The archery tournament sequence is a joy to behold--and de Havilland was never more beautifully photographed than in her reaction close-ups as she realizes the tournament is a trap.<br /><br />Una O'Connor is a joy as her loyal servant and Alan Hale makes a wonderful Little John. In fact, all of the supporting roles are perfectly cast.<br /><br />Rousing entertainment that has charmed the socks off everyone since its release in 1938 and outclasses the Kevin Costner version in every way possible. Long live the bandit of Sherwood Forest!!<br /><br />And last but not least, Erich Wolfgang Korngold's classic score remains one of the finest film scores ever, sweeping, majestic and always complimenting the on-screen action and romance.<br /><br />Fortunately, it all looks and sounds better than ever before in the restored Ultra-Resolution process Warners used on their 2 Disc DVD. It probably looks even more gorgeous than it did on its original release in 1938 when it opened at Radio City Music Hall to rave reviews.r than ever before in the restored Ultra-Resolution process Warners used on their 2 Disc DVD.

B000JU7IC4|5.0|A lot of people have expressed surprise at this great Paul Simon album but I'm not sure why. One of the reasons given by Paul as to why he broke up one of the more successful vocal duos ever was his intention to pursue a different musical direction, one that involved his great love for rhythm, and we get large doses of that on this album which incorporates not only African rhythmic styles but also Cajun folk rhythms.<br /><br />We get complex time signatures and constantly changing rhythms not only in the music but also in the acapella vocal stylings of \\"Diamonds On the Soles of Her Shoes\\" which is full of syncopated rhythms. Fans of Paul are very familiar with his love for rhythm from earlier great tracks like the Grammy winning \\"Late in the Evening\\" which would have fit in well in this album as well.<br /><br />This version is also special as it comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve design packaging that very faithfully imitates the original lp design down to the lyrics on the inner sleeve which holds the cd and the sound quality has been remastered very, very well for a great sound. The bonus tracks are an excellent plus as well, the demo version of \\"Homeless\\" the standout of the 3. You also get all the lyrics included in both English and Japanese.  This is probably the best version of this album that is currently out there and is a must for all fans of great rhythmic music.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

0321146530|4.0|I really like this book and it helps me a lot when I was developing a prototype of a complex application.<br /><br />The idea of using tests to force you to think about the APIs is powerfull and the use of Python to implement a xUnit framework is very interesting.<br /><br />But if you are a experienced developer you will find the first part of the book very boring because Kent uses extremely small steps to develop their example.
0375831002|5.0|I did not know quite what to expect with this book, but I ended up loving it. I listened to the audiobook and then ended up buying it, which I only do with books I really like. The audiobook was very well done, with good narration. I am also very glad that I got the actual book because the drawings are wonderful. <br /> <br />The book is narrated by Death, which is a wonderful vehicle for highlighting the countless deaths during the Second World War. The main character - Liesel Meminger - is a young girl who goes to live with foster parents, the Hubermans. As we watch her grow up, we see not only the suffering of the Jews as they march to the concentration camps, but we also see the suffering and loss of the average German citizen. The characters are wonderful: Liesel, whose fascination for books is the theme that holds the book together and moves it forward; her friend Rudy, who at one point colors his entire body black and runs through the district pretending he is Jesse Owens; her father Hans Huberman, who plays accordion, works as a painter, and reads to her every night when she wakes  up at 2 or 3 AM with nightmares; her mother Rosa Huberman, who has a curse word for everyone around to mask her gentle heart; and Max, the young Jewish fist fighter that their family harbors secretly. <br /> <br />Read this book. I suspect it will touch your heart like it touched mine.

B00012FXB8|3.0|After 20th Century Fox achieved great success with their sci-fi/horror classic \\"Alien\\" directed by Ridley Scott, and gained even greater success with the follow-up effort \\"Aliens\\" from director James Cameron, it had to be a virtual no-brainer to move forward on a third installment on the budding franchise.  Enter relatively new director David Fincher (the third director for the franchise) who had the misfortune of trying to meet the expectations of the fans, but also that of the studio based on the first two films quality and success.  However, success for Fincher and his film \\"Alien 3\\" was going to be relatively hard to come by as the studio reportedly tampered repeatedly with the script to where the cast and crew never knew from day to day what the overall story would be for the film.  This no doubt would make for a daunting task for any director, and an extremely uncomfortable and unsettling experience for a newcomer who could possibly destroy a franchise with one stinker of a movie. <br /> <br />\\"Alien 3\\" finds our tough-as-nails heroine Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash landing on Fiorina 161, a maximum-security prison planet.  Upon recovering from her harrowing experience during the last film, Ripley begins to suspect that there may have been another alien hidden onboard her ship.  Her fears soon become realized when the convicts that populate this dreary planet begin to meet gruesome fates, leaving Ripley with the one option that she knows all to well, face down the creature before it's too late.  As if the alien running loose wasn't enough to contend with Ripley is being plagued by a nightmare that she may have an alien inside of her body, but is it merely her mind playing tricks on her or is it a frightening reality? <br /> <br />So after two highly successful entries under this franchise's belt, would \\"Alien 3\\"  be another terrific installment and make itself yet another success story for the executives at Fox to boast about or would it be devastating blow to a franchises future possibilities?  The answer, much to the dismay of director David Fincher (though not really to his surprise), \\"Alien 3\\" proved to be the least successful entry in the franchise and one that makes the audience wonder if this is a series that has already reached its peak potential. <br /> <br />The story was an interesting one, and full of potential if handled properly; however, the reported tinkering by the studio (a concept that is hardly foreign in Hollywood) would cause this film to fall flat on its face in a heaping pile of unused potential and disappointment.  There are some neat elements to the story, the cameo appearance of Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and the final scene with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley coming to a shocking conclusion as to what she must do to save the remaining convicts of the planet are the biggest highlights of the film.  In the director's defense, he did film some other exciting scenes that did make it into a type of director's cut that was released to DVD, and the scenes though not all finished show how much better the film could have been if Fincher had been given a proper chance to make it right. <br /> <br />The cast of the film, led once again by Sigourney Weaver (who seemed a bit bored in this installment), was relatively strong.  Though one does miss the energy of Bill Paxton and the intensity of Michael Biehn, but Lance Henriksen's appearance does help the proceedings.  The special effects were good, though not heavily relied upon, it appeared that Fincher was attempting to go for atmosphere much like Ridley Scott did with the original film; sadly the sets used to create the prison were too much alike and the shadows caused the audience (being me) to be confused as to what the difference was between different locations.  Leaving me to wonder at times which characters were where and who exactly was in danger of becoming the latest prey for the alien. <br /> <br />The movie could have been another great entry into the franchise, but studio tinkering and too much confusion led to \\"Alien 3\\" not quite living up to the expectations of the fans and a less successful stint at the box office. <br /> <br />\\"Alien 3\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B00006AVRK|5.0|I just received the complete series from Amazon a few days ago.  I have watched the first three episodes of the first season.  I had to stop because my sides were hurting from laughing so hard.  Laurie and Fry are perfect as Bertie and Jeeves, as are the rest of the crazies! <br /> <br />I have read most of the Jeeves and Bertie books and the series is, for the most part, right on target.  The acting, the cinematography, and the various historic places in England were they filmed are extraordinary. <br /> <br />Well worth the price of the ticket.  This series I will watch again and again.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|I'm not sure why it took so  long for this title to come out on DVD - Paramount has been criticized for their slow release of titles - but it's a great package.  On top of the film - which looks great - you get some great extras that provide a fascinating look at the history of this movie.  The one thing that bothers me is the absence of the original movie trailer.  It's a bit ridiculous when a DVD hits the market, sometimes a few months after it was in the theaters, and includes the trailer.  We were watching that trailer on TV not that long ago!  It's much more interesting for classic movies to include the trailer when it's released on DVD to give us a complete historical package.  This DVD doesn't include the original trailer, but includes the trailer made for this DVD release - an advertisement for this product that most buyers probably haven't seen until they purchased it!
B000002MUN|5.0|Dear Amazon, <br /> <br />Mr. Himes review of Mr. Petty's work is snarky and shallow.  His characterization of Petty & George Harrison (two of the all-time greats) as \\"second tier\\" is condescending and uninformed.  As a frequent customer who is a Harrison & Petty centric rock fan, it's a turn-off to read drivel such as this.
0099288524|4.0|The craftsmanship in THE HUMAN FACTOR is superb, with Greene creating a carefully balanced cast of characters whose decisions and actions regarding marriage, friendship, professional integrity, and basic morality strike rich contrasts with those of Maurice Castle, this novel's protagonist. Further, the novel contains Greene's usual deft irony, particularly in the denouement, where Greene, with just a few quick strokes, is able to show the principled actions of Castle as the equivalent of futile self-sacrifice.<br /><br />For people with my middlebrow sensibilities, this craftsmanship creates the best of all worlds. That is, THE HUMAN FACTOR is both a fast-moving and intriguing narrative and a dramatization of a complex personal and professional situation. At the finish, this reader then took the time to ponder whether Castle did the right thing or if really he had any choice, given his quiet yet rock-solid integrity.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Castle is a difficult protagonist to appreciate. This is because he is a dull and repressed man who is seeking a life of routine and tranquility. Oddly, this quality, not his integrity, is at the center of his character, even as the cautious Castle acts on his principles. This, in my opinion, is the single flaw in this novel: Castle seems dull, even in his moments of principled behavior and reckless choice.<br /><br />Still, this is a fine novel and highly recommended.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|I was very disappointed in this movie. The previous performances of the actors tricked me into thinking this might be a good film. It is difficult to see Jack Black in a romantic lead even though I love the work he has done in films like High Fidelity and School of Rock. I kept pushing myself to watch a little longer hoping it would improve. I finally turned it off because I was bored to tears. I think a better job could have been done with the premise of trading homes and looking for romance.

They're impractical, awarkard and, well, cheap.

Like having a water shortage in your house for a week could lead you to know some survival skills to \\"create\\" water from the elements. <br /> <br />The book is well written as well as very comprehensive.

B000PGTPE6|4.0|The album is everything the other reviewers say it is, and I can't add to them.

1582701709|2.0|Undoubtedly according to the world's wisdom traditions there is a lot to be said for the power of positive thinking.  Indeed, according to the Dhammapada (ancient Buddhist text), everything arises with intention and thought.  However.... I think that reality might be a bit more complex than the way it is presented in this book.  Ditto... for the nature of the self as presented in the text I just quoted.<br /><br />While I agree that positive thinking and taking responsibility for our feelings, thoughts and outcomes is wise and largely validated by the effectiveness of such things as cognitive therapy, it doesn't take into account other people's free will, random happenings, etc.  In short, I find this to be an overly simplistic, but perhaps well-intentioned guide to manifesting various realities (e.g. money) in your life.<br /><br />I think something that would be more credible is a theory that takes into account the possiblity that reality might be \\"co-created.\\"  For example, did my personal thinking cause the war in Iraq.  No, I believe this resulted from the sum of the intentions of many people all in very complex types of interrelationship.  Also, what about intersubjectivity?  Clearly, for love to be, there must be an \\"other\\" and somehow something new arises in an intersubjective relationship that is more than the sum of the parts.  If this is the case, then it would seem that this book and its concepts leans very heavily toward a narcisstic self-importance sometimes bordering on magical or at least mythical thinking.<br /><br />It is clear enough that positive expectations, loving thoughts, taking on multiple perspectives and keeping a positive attitude even in adversity is good for health, stress relief, etc.  However, it doesn't logically follow that this ALONE is sufficient to bring about whatever you want to make happen.  If this is so, then there would be many grateful overnight millionaires writing to endorse this book.  The point I'm making is that MANY things are under our control, but some things clearly are not.  For example, did a newborn who contracted AIDS or a crack addiction cause that via their negative thinking?  Perhaps, if you extrapolate the concepts presented here to a past life.  However, what if this isn't true?!<br /><br />On the other hand, I do believe that we all participate in reality.  We individually and collectively create or at least shape reality.  Also, any theory or idea exists in someone's mind or consciousness first.  Even observations effect experiments as we know from quantum physics.  There is also an interior to a society i.e. its values and culture.  Certainly, this collective has an influence on the external world.  I think we saw this with the rise of patriarchy and the steps forward with the feminist movement, civils rights movement, etc.<br /><br />Again... I think a highly realized being has the power to lift those around them.  However, even Gandhi didn't stop what was happening in India around the time and immediately after his death.  He certainly had a powerful influence, but not an absolute one.  For someone like Jesus, maybe this control is absolute, but I don't believe it is for the majority of us.  If it is, then perhaps the author would like to stand on some train tracks and see if they could will the train to stop or to walk away without injury.<br /><br />While I see a lot of merit in promoting positive thinking, I think this book represents a naive oversimplification as I asserted above.  At the same time, I can see where its concepts would be beneficial to many readers as a good starting point for changing their lives.  However, a more comprehensive model such as Ken Wilber's might be even more useful as described in [[ASIN:1591791243 Kosmic Consciousness]] or a [[ASIN:1590304500 A Brief History of Everything]].<br /><br />Some of the editorial reviews pointed out that this is a New Age type of book.  I certainly agree with this point, but what do we mean by NewAge.  What I mean by New Age in this review is an attempt to reduce and ineffable reality to something that could be comprehended and completely controlled by the human mind.  I also consider in SOME CASES to be reduction of interiors or subjectivity to the deepest levels of physical reality i.e. quantum physics, depth ecology, etc.  This is still just the study of ever smaller and more complex surfaces, often without any recognition of the possiblity of something higher in an ontological sense e.g. soul, spirit or whatever.  (I also acknowledge that there are many excellent New Age publications that are much more thoughtful, better written and more sophisticated.)<br /><br />Lots of New Age material is spiritual and recognizes spirit, but some does not.  Others identify the highest reaches of spirit with nature mysticism, shamanism, etc.  Could really be more complex?  Many philosophers, theologians and poets certainly seem to think so.  Is it possible that a human being contemplating the way things work is somewhat like an ant contemplating the complexity of the human nervous system?<br /><br />I am also suspicious of a book that focuses heavily on material success as a major handbook on the nature of reality.  I would suspect that someone that had the \\"secret\\" would be occupied with more elevated concerns such as stopping wars, ending poverty, etc.  While I do feel thinking, visualizing and having meaningful goals you believe in will carry you far toward your goals... chance and other people may play a role too.  I don't really think other people are simply pawns that are moved by our will into place almost like characters on a stage.<br /><br />On the other hand, I think it is possible to transcend relative reality (the world we see) to various degrees depending upon our development and ability to love.  This appears to be in contradiction with the strong emphasis on wealth creation and accumulating \\"stuff\\" whether of a material, special realtionship or even spiritual nature.  Yes... I believe there is such a thing as spiritual materialism and I think some people bypass necessary growth of consciousness and transfer their ego attachment with possessions to non-material possessions.  I also believe that highly realized being can influence reality more than the rest of us.<br /><br />I rated the book a two because it's somewhat entertaining and food for thought.  For people who are not primarily oriented toward philosophy, it can certainly prompt them to think deeply about the important questions of life.<br /><br />One of the spotlight reviews mentioned [[ASIN:080701429X Man's Search for Meaning]] as a more in-depth look at the human condition.  I agree with this recommendation and I would also suggest the other book mentioned by this reviewer.<br /><br />A last point I would like to \\"call out\\" is what do we mean by the \\"I\\" that is manifesting all of this stuff?  Is it the ego or something else?  If it is something else, is it part of a larger whole perhaps connected to it by love?  Again... the world's wisdom traditions seem to think this is the case.  If so, then it would appear a surrendering to something larger than our immediate wants, gratification of our ego desires and that transcends the boundaries of the everyday self may have more explanatory power and be a more accurate reflection of reality.  Aren't we all connected in some way?  Many philosophers/theologians/sages seem to think we are part of a larger whole as a wave is part of the ocean or an eddy is part of a whole stream.  If this is true, then aligning with the movement of the whole and not identifying so strongly with the part would make more sense to me than what is presented here.

I seriously doubt, however, if it will replace good planning, hard work, loving-kindness, equanimity and a deep understanding of a reality that is beyond words and concepts.ltionship or even spiritual nature.  Yes... I believe there is such a thing as spiritual materialism and I think some people bypass necessary growth of consciousness and transfer their ego attachment with possessions to non-material possessions.  I also believe that highly realized being can influence reality more than the rest of us. <br /> <br />I rated the book a two because it's somewhat entertaining and food for thought.  For people who are not primarily oriented toward philosophy, it can certainly prompt them to think deeply about the important questions of life. <br /> <br />One of the spotlight reviews mentioned [[ASIN:080701429X Man's Search for Meaning]] as a more in-depth look at the human condition.  I agree with this recommendation and I would also suggest the other book mentioned by this reviewer. <br /> <br />A last point I would like to \\"call out\\" is what do we mean by the \\"I\\" that is manifesting all of this stuff?  Is it the ego or something else?  If it is something else, is it part of a larger whole perhaps connected to it by love?  Again... the world's wisdom traditions seem to think this is the case.  If so, then it would appear a surrendering to something larger than our immediate wants, gratification of our ego desires and that transcends the boundaries of the everyday self may have more explanatory power and be a more accurate reflection of reality.

B0009VRHLK|2.0|The premise of the movie is decent, and the ending is almost good, however it's a torturous ride to the end.  90% of this movie is the main character driving...  Just driving, no dialog, no music, just road noise.  I recommend hitting the FF button whenever the car is moving.
0811729117|5.0|I saw some of the negative reviews and although some were correct, I don't think to an extent to take away from the remarkable story and piece of history this book is. Carius is too apologetic for Germany and Hitler, but he doesn't do it often enough to have a major impact on the value of his book. It's like he wrote the book while he was there almost, and doesn't take what he learned later on into account so much to ruin the real story.  He let's you know how he felt and what it was like in 1944, not what it was like in 1960 thinking back on 1944. While I think he is wrong at times, I also was not in his shoes.  Yes, I feel like the man himself is writing it in his own terms instead of having some guy polish him up too much. I'm glad he didn't try to sugercoat everything with a writing style that is not him. If you want to read about what happened to Carius in his own words (a real tiger tank company commander who tells his story), than have a look. I don't want War and Peace, I want Otto Carius. It's also nice to see the view from an intermediate officer who had dealings with sargents and lieutenants usually but did get to mingle with upper crust Nazi's at times. His viewpoint is interesting and if you read between the lines, I think you get a real look at the way some things actual were, which is rare.

B000JIHP88|4.0|I like this mobile, the leaves moving up and down, the animals slowly moving around. this is lovely, with soft music for baby, and even a little night light. This is a gorgeous exotic looking mobile. It is pleasant to look at and always catches my sons eye.<br /><br /> This does run on big batteries, not included. It requires some assembly. I was able to put it together :) must have a philps screwdriver.<br /><br /> The music is ok, but none of the music is listed under the correct composer, that isn't a serious problem at all, but something worth noting. Mozart plays bach, Bach plays Beethoven, Beethoven plays Mozart. This is a good quality product, just what I wanted, and I think i love it more than my son does.
B00005JLCI|5.0|1997's \\"William Shakespeare's Hamlet\\" is a full-length production of the original play, running to a daunting but entirely worthwhile four hours.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh, veteran of earlier screen productions of \\"Henry V\\" and \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\", is entirely credible as the melancholy Prince of Denmark, suspecting subterfuge in his father's murder and his mother's rapid remarriage.  His delivery of Hamlet's signature sililoquy in a hall of mirrors is his own but excellent.  The length of the production allows for a full exploration of Hamlet's behavior and of his plan for revenge; Branagh deserves credit for sustaining the ambiguity of his character throughout.  His energy drives what might otherwise have become an exhausting movie, which even includes the timely arrival of the Norwegian Army at the end of the climactic sword fight between Hamlet and Ophelia's brother.<br /><br />Branagh is supported by an absolutely stellar cast of \\"name\\" actors and actresses, including Kate Winslet as the unfortunate Ophelia. Noticing actors like Robin Williams and Jack Lemon in their minor roles becomes almost a little distracting as the movie progresses.<br /><br />The length of the movie allows for the close exploration of the lavish sets; Blenheim Palace in England stands in for the Elsinore of the play.  Period costumes and furnishings are detailed and everywhere in evidence.<br /><br />This movie is most highly recommended to fans of Shakespeare and of Hamlet, who will be rewarded with an entertaining and quality effort for the investment of time.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This action-packed, fast paced, movie has it all and it keeps your attention as well. People need to understand that Hollywood makes millions of dollars with this particular style of film, and who is to blame them. If something gives you a positive outcome, then it would be foolish not to attempt it again. I also understand that there are those movies that are on a category of their own and that break the boundaries of a typical Hollywood movie. But, Armaggedon serves its main purpose. It keeps you entertained and it has all the elements that make an action movie great. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer are a lethal combination when it comes to this particular genre of movies, and I feel that is an honest compliment to admit that they are two of the best out there. Job well done! <br /> <br />
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|We rented the DVD from Netflix and I was fascinated with the idea that these two stars, Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, actually did their own vocals, so I wanted the CD.  They are not fabulous singers, but they are alright and it is true to the spirit and flavor of the movie. <br />I love it.  It recreates a couple of my favorite scenes from the movie as I drive along in my car.  I am glad they included the dialog in the demo version of \\"Way Back Into Love.\\"   <br />My only criticism would be that they did not include some of the other songs in the movie which I would have loved.  I guess they had trouble getting permission for that.
B000FGGE5Y|2.0|If there is genius here, it must reside in the ultraviolet spectrum, for this fool's eyes can't see it.  Perhaps writer/director Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Sphere) thought it was sufficient to wrap ideas from past successes around the scaffolding of this movie's comic-book foundation.  However, this structure will not last eons, and probably will crumble from the minds of most audience members the minute \\"End\\" is registered by their photoreceptors.<br /><br />In the recent past, a bioweapons lab, seeking to modify the DNA of a known virus for military application, instead accidentally makes the pathogen infinitely more virulent than it was before.  Far from causing a few sniffles, this new bug escapes the facility via rapid transmission and replication, and speeds along Homo sapiens evolution by a couple of hundred millennia of so, facilitating the emergence of the Hemophages.  The government seeks to contain the \\"plague,\\" and collects those who are contagious, sending them to concentration-camp-like isolation zones.  When it is discovered that these collected persons are never heard from again, the Hemophages organize for their very survival.  Although they have superhuman powers of lightning speed and great strength, the Hemophages seem incapable in making inroads against their oppressors:  they require a secret weapon of their own.<br /><br />Seemingly doomed to the role of fighting-vixen for all time, Milla Jovovich again dons the Lycra-impregnated jumpsuit to fiercely impart justice to any random redshirt who tumbles her way.  Violet (Milla) is the ultimate infiltrator of the Hemophages.  This group of pseudo-vampires has banded together to elude the hygiene-obsessed Daxus (Nick Chinlund).  In principle, this seems simple--unfortunately, Daxus acts as despot over an army of gasmask-wearing, Uzi-toting thugs who seems singularly incapable of doing any actual fighting.  The film opens with Violet piercing the security systems of Daxus' main laboratory.  She successfully poses as a courier, enduring bone, retinal, DNA, blood, and voice-scans before being allowed full access to the package she has been \\"hired\\" to deliver.  The real security-courier arrives seconds after the package has been delivered into Violet's gloved hand, triggering klaxons, low-level minion attacks, and an escape sequence which, quite literally, defies gravity.<br /><br />Following countless action sequences--during which the viewer neither believes not cares that Violet's life is in any real danger--it is revealed that the \\"weapon\\" is really a young boy who acts as host for a virus capable of eradicating all Hemophages.  Trapped in an extra-dimensional space inside the package, Six (Cameron Bright) soon whisks away Violet's common sense with one or two pouty expressions, requiring her to also find refuges from her previous kin.<br /><br />There are an abundance of new and borrowed science-fiction ideas secreted away in this mess of a movie--a pity because a better story may have implemented them more interestingly, and more cohesively.  The extra-dimensional storage space is capable of holding near-infinite quantities of weapons, ammunition, boys, etc.  The sanitation-themed society bears similarity to the real world of yesterday, in regards to the maniacal devotion to facial-handkerchief implementation seen in individuals who succumbed to fear of the SARS virus.  Super-powerful ninja-vampires suggest a \\"Blade\\"-like influence.<br /><br />However, no amount of special ideas could have saved this movie from being, at best, fluff.  The dialogue is atrocious, with endless pseudo-philosophical ruminations which remind us of the more easily-forgotten \\"deep\\" conversations we all thought we had in college.  The plot is intricate in a maddeningly unimportant way, as I simply didn't care to puzzle the whole thing out.  The action is absolutely unbelievable, horribly edited, and 100% bloodless--a bit of gore could have at least appeased the viewer's inner voyeur.Inside, we get sterile, uninteresting, and repetitive \\"gun-blade\\" fighting (guns are used as projectile and melee weapons).  This movie is like \\"Equilibrium\\" under the influence of a fistful of diazepam, with a couple ounces of any given hallucinogen thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Chinlund is an excellent actor who steals every scene he's in--as the noseplug-wearing Daxus, he is suitably over-the-top and quite entertaining.  Jovovich is eye-candy for those favoring females of Kievan Rus extraction, and little more.  Bright is believable as a doomed boy-weapon thrown into a titanic struggle where he is only a pawn.  He is also less creepy than he was in previous roles, but only by a hair.<br /><br />\\"Ultraviolet\\" is recommended for those bed-bound, who are also fortunate enough to be accompanied by several good mates and a smattering of potent beverages.  To summarize, this is a perfect drinking-game movie.  Drink once for every ten vanquished enemies, twice for every five shots of Milla's exposed midriff, and thrice for every smile that cracks the face of Daxus.r voyeur.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|I never watched the show before this season. Turthfully I didn't know what it was about.  Then it was aired after my favorite show Gilmore Girls and I was hocked.

0062502182|3.0|The Alchemist was an inspiring novel which portrayed a different view of life.  It conveyed the theme of never giving up on your hopes and dream.  The main character Santiago goes on a journey and must make many difficult decisions on his path to finding his personal treasure.  His journey is very inspiring and gives the reader a sense of hope and inspiration.  For those who want to read an uplifting novel The Alchemist is the perfect.  The novel is not only uplifting but teaches life lessons that are portrayed through proverbs.  By reading Santiago's journey the reader can learn much about the importance of life and one's personal treasure.  The story line itself seems random and mysterious at times.  Many events in the novel seem arbitrary but each event shows a new life lesson learned and contributes to the overall theme of perseverance.  Even though these events are necessary to the story the can sometimes be confusing.  Also the story skips around missing parts which leave out many detail of Santiago's journey.  Days and even years go by which leaves the reader wondering about the events in-between.  Overall the story was very moving but a very short read which would have been better if the story was more in depth.
1400049628|4.0|I bought this book because my 14 year old son wanted it but ended up reading it myself (he also likes it a lot, by the way).  <br /> <br />I always wondered why these people on the run from Zombies decide to hole up in a shopping mall with these big and unsafe entrances. Is this really a good idea? <br />And why must they always board up the windows in such a way that even a weakened zombie break through? Could I have done better? <br />And when you have found a safe hide-out in the country and have cleared the surroundings from Zombies, how can you make sure you can go swimming in the lake, when Zombies can hide out at the bottom of the lake unseen? <br /> <br />This book answered pretty much all of my technical questions regarding Zombies and a lot more I have never thought about - for instance how the old Romans could deal with Zombie-outbreaks so effectively... <br /> <br />I can whole-heartedly recommend this book to everyone who has ever chuckled in a George Romero movie.

0812550757|4.0|Like most readers, I came to this book after reading Ender's Game. <br />Speaker for the Dead is much more ambitious - indeed Card considers <br />Ender's Game a preamble - however I thought that it was also far less  <br />succesful.  The aliens are really no more alien than some of the native <br />tribes of Oceania where to the Europeans when they first came into <br />contact.  The idea of the speaker is somewhat interesting, but the  <br />story of first (and second) contact is overall a bit unsatisfying.  I find <br />it much more likely that, if it ever occurs, the first contact will be more <br />like the one described by Stanislaw Lem than that described by Card.

B000O77RLE|4.0|Most people are familiar with WW2 based on the almost romanticized European theatre, while the battles in the Pacific are less common especially in modern films.  Go to Japan and they are basically non-existant.<br />So I believe that it was a sense of duty to the film makers of Letters from Iwo Jima to tell this story, not just to American audiences but especially for Japanese audiences as well.  It's a part of history everyone is beginning to forget and the story of the Japanese men on that island needs to be told, and with this film it is told quite well.<br />The picture and sound are good being on Blu-ray, and it also has several special features such as press interviews with the cast and director, Clint Eastwood, which are very revealing.  The extras are not in high-def however, but still looked good upconverted on my Playstation 3 and HDTV.<br />This film isn't on my top ten favorite WW2 films, but it is very good and easily worth a watch.  If you are a WW2 buff you are sure to be pleased.
B000LXH0AE|2.0|BIG DISAPPOINTMENT - considering the film stars Wil Ferrel and Dustin Hoffman. The plot revolves around a single IRS man who one days starts hearing a voice and realises she is an author who is writing a book which is actually his life, in all this he also falls for a chick he is doing a tax audit, but once he realises that the author is going to kill him off he goes about to try and stop it - no prizes for how it ends - the laughs are few and far between.

B000002P74|5.0|This is just about as good a CD as Pronounced. Maybe even better in some ways. A must for any collector. I think I will always enjoy this CD regardless of my age. Hard to believe I'll be rockin' to Skynyrd when I reach 80, but who cares. Rock on.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Unfortunately, in today's television industry, it's rare to find programming that is well-crafted, original, and entertaining.<br /><br />Veronica Mars is all that and more!  :)<br /><br />Veronica Mars is a strong young woman who has an incredible and healthy relationship with her single father.  She isn't the most popular person in the crowd, but the friendships she has are solid and true.  She has very real struggles in life - stretching for independence yet yearning to earn and keep her father's pride and trust, working to become a responsible young adult while stumbling along the way.<br /><br />It's hard to put into words the various complexities \\"Veronica Mars\\" tackles in a very real and thoughtful manner.  The show truly speaks very well for itself, and I highly recommend you watch it and see for yourself that it's a fantastic program.
B00000GAIW|5.0|One of the best CDs I could have bought. Its a true classic with tunes that will forever be tied to the artist Jethro Tull, even if he has moved on to other modes of expression. I like this CD. It was a real classic in my time.
0143038419|5.0|This author has an impressive writing voice and a good sense of humor about herself and life.  What a voyage, and how beautiful that it turned out so well for her.  The book lags a bit in the middle, but picks right up again at the end.  I wille be reading more of her books.
B00006JKON|4.0|At first I was not thrilled with this CD, but themore I listened to it, the more I liked it. There are some really good tunes on here, and some less that good ones, but overall, if you like Tull, yuou'll like this one. Quite a bit different from Aqualung, but it has some decent hits on it.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Although the movie is definately one of my favorites of all time, this DVD is awful.  The picture quality is not good, and the extras are severely lacking.  Wait for the inevitable double-dip, and if you have a BD player, wait for it there.
B000024D4R|5.0|I guess I like Pink Floyd. This is quite a trippy collection, but worth a spin.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|By now, Dream Theater fans should be used to the band's new studio album release schedule.  Almost two years to the day after OCTAVARIUM came out, we basically knew and felt like it was time for another album. <br /> <br />I've so far listened to this album six times and it gets better with every listen (much like OCTAVARIUM, which didn't quite grab me right away).  I believe that Mike Portnoy hit the nail on the head when he mentioned on the SCORE bonus disk that METROPOLIS 2: SCENES FROM A MEMORY was \\"the resurrection of Dream Theater....\\"  This is probably because every album from that moment sounds more powerful.  While listening to SYSTEMATIC CHAOS, I could recall just about every one of my favorite moments from the previous four albums (plus some other stuff from way earlier in their career). <br /> <br />OCTAVARIUM was a kind of free-floating up-and-down mix of styles that, while very good, wasn't quite as powerful as some of these newer 21st century Dream Theater releases.  SYSTEMATIC CHAOS, for whatever reason, seems a lot more focused and edgy and way heavier, not to mention that it seemed the most experimental and technical album they've done since SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE.  In any case, they've managed to balance out the intensity of those previous four albums and create, so far, the best 79 minutes of music I've heard all year. <br /> <br />It's a thrill ride from start to finish.  The first seconds of \\"In the Presence of Enemies, pt. 1\\" sound like the Dream Theater we all know and love, sometimes taking pages from the Liquid Tension Experiment sessions.  The latter half of the first track reminds me more of both \\"Blind Faith\\" and \\"About to Crash.\\"  On the first listen, I wasn't quite grabbed by the lyrics (a bit of problem for me on this album, but now I don't much care anymore; I like the music first, really), but once I watched the bonus DVD of the making of the album, I had a better appreciation. <br /> <br />\\"Forsaken\\" sounds like they brokeinto Evanescence's practice space late at night and stole what would have probably ended up on their latest album.  It's the weakest song, in my opinion, but still very good.  Its rather accessable feel and song structure probably could have put it on OCTAVARIUM, but the heaviness of the guitar riffs remind of the TRAIN OF THOUGHT album. <br /> <br />Fifteen minutes in, we get to Mike Portnoy's first song, apparently about his psychological state (obsessive compulsive disorder), which is a subject that has been rearing its head numerous times over the past few years.  \\"Constant Motion\\" starts out with some rather progressive elements in the intro before finally settling to an old-Metallica-style verse and chorus.  The dual vocals of James LaBrie and Mike Portnoy kind of remind me a combination of \\"The Glass Prison,\\" as well as a little \\"Burning My Soul,\\" \\"Under a Glass Moon,\\" and \\"Fatal Tragedy\\" thrown in for good measure.  Again, not the best song on the CD, and certainly not my favorite, but this is the kind of thing that Dream Theater has become revered for lately. <br /> <br />\\"The Dark Eternal Night,\\" after the first listen, was probably my favorite song on SYSTEMATIC CHAOS right up until that point.  The opening instrumental parts and verses sound like a combination of Slayer, Pantera, and Mudvayne (that bass chord really does it for me), as well as earlier songs like \\"The Mirror\\" and \\"Honor Thy Father.\\"  Parts of the chorus remind me of bits of \\"A Change of Seasons\\" and \\"Endless Sacrifice.\\"  Then came the bridge, which honestly left me laughing hysterically at the way they arranged the parts.  It's like they chopped up \\"The Dance of Eternity\\" into small pieces, threw them in the air, and wherever they fell was what they came up with.  It's death metal, then ragtime piano, then some more death metal, then some jazz fusion section, and some blistering guitar solo.  This might be the strangest song they've come up with in years, or at the very least, the strangest bridge.  This song probably has the heaviest guitar riff (in the outro) they've ever written. <br /> <br />In previous recordings, Mike Portnoy's AA songs have typically been all-out shred fests; I recall listening to \\"The Glass Prison\\" for the first time and being blown away by that kind of technical guitar skill.  \\"The Root of All Evil\\" was a little more tame, but with that being the third installment of the series, I was beginning to think that future songs in the series would be absolutely unforgiving in terms of speed and volume -- surprisingly, not the case.  \\"Repentance\\" is rather mellowed out and, honestly, a welcome change.  It kind of reminded me of Porcupine Tree (Steve Wilson is on there, anyway, as one of the guys doing voice-overs during the latter half of the song) and Pink Floyd, and it seemed to borrow from such previous songs as \\"Disappear,\\" \\"Peruvian Skies,\\" and \\"Sacrificed Sons.\\"  After listening to this, you, like myself, might find yourself wondering how the hell they're going to wrap up this now four-album-long series of songs.  I would be interested in knowing how this is going to end. <br /> <br />OCTAVARIUM contained a song called \\"Never Enough,\\" which sounded like \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" and \\"Hysteria\\" by Muse.  After the release of Muse's BLACK HOLES AND REVELATIONS, Dream Theater probably figured that, hey, one derivation of Muse is never enough (pun intended).  The result was \\"Prophets of War,\\" a song that questions the direction and leadership of the U.S. war on terror and war in Iraq.  It's not the best song on the CD by any stretch, nor is it anywhere near as good as \\"Never Enough,\\" but it does continue the sort of social awareness in the lyrics as displayed on previous albums in songs like \\"The Great Debate,\\" \\"In the Name of God,\\" and \\"Sacrificed Sons.\\"  On an album on which John Petrucci seems to be resorting to writing short stories and adapting them to music rather than writing about himself, it was somewhat of a surprise to find James LaBrie finding room for this song on this album.  The fan chant section is also pretty cool and lends itself to the dissent theme and message of the song. <br /> <br />The seventh song has been a favorite of mine on previous Dream Theater releases (\\"In the Name of God,\\" \\"Sacrificed Sons,\\" \\"The Mirror,\\" and \\"Lines In the Sand\\").  Here, they've provided me with another great one, \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\"; it also happens to be my favorite song on the CD.  This is because it recalls my favorite moments from recent albums.  Basically a long power ballad, this reminds me of a whole bunch of things at once, including \\"Beyond This Life,\\" \\"Through Her Eyes,\\" \\"Home,\\" \\"Finally Free,\\" \\"Blind Faith,\\" \\"Losing Time,\\" \\"Endless Sacrifice,\\" \\"In the Name of God,\\" \\"I Walk Beside You,\\" \\"Sacrificed Sons,\\" and \\"Octavarium\\" -- and probably numerous other Dream Theater songs.  The overall essence of the band can probably be bottled into this single 15-minute song.  The guitar leads are just gravy and the bridge is excellent.  Fans of the aforementioned songs are going to love this. <br /> <br />After listening to just under an hour of music after the first track, SYSTEMATIC CHAOS is finally sandwiched with \\"In the Presence of Enemies, pt. 2.\\"  I think that if the entire song was kept whole for 26 continuous minutes, it wouldn't have had the same effect.  In fact, this track arrangement is a lot like the running theme of OCTAVARIUM.  As one would expect, the themes from part 1 are brought back.  While the musical arrangement is impecable, the lyrics are kind of cornball (\\"My soul is yours, Dark Master/I will fight for you\\"); suddenly, I have the urge to get a 20-sider and roll for initiative.  Sorry, just kidding.  This is basically the battle of good and evil going on within, the presence of a conscience.  While I get the idea, I just think that the lyrics could have been better than they are.  Other fun songs from years gone by rear their heads on this song; the \\"III - Heretic\\" chorus keyboards sound like \\"Sacrificed Sons,\\" \\"Pull Me Under,\\" \\"War Inside My Head,\\" and \\"A Change of Seasons; and \\"IV - The Slaughter of the Damned\\" sounds like \\"The Glass Prison,\\" \\"The Great Debate,\\" \\"Learning to Live,\\" and \\"These Walls.\\"  Much of the end of the song is remeniscent of \\"The Dance of Eternity,\\" \\"Octavarium,\\" \\"Trial of Tears,\\" and \\"Losing Time.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, the entire album is basically what the album title states.  Totally out of control songwriting and structuring, but played with the elan and class that we've come to love these guys for.  Really, I have to dock half a star for the lyrics, but the musicianship is quality.
B00000DGUY|4.0|This work has there more famous hits, and a bunch of secondary ones if you ask me. Stick to their first album. Good tunes, but they start to sound lot alike after awhile.
B00005LIN0|5.0|A film of a staged performance always is interesting if the background doesn't take over.  In this Glynnebourne production later filmed at a studio, that is the case.  Good cast, great music (Gershwin's only opera), and popular in Europe as well as the U.S., this \\"Porgy\\" is a classic.
B000002GVO|5.0|This is quintessential Eagles. The CD is chocked full of tunes that made the Eagles famous. A fine collection any fan of the Eagles would enjoy. One of my favorite CDs in college. You can check out, but you can never leave. A classic line that really brought back my days of struggling through my first year adjusting to college and being away from home. A great CD, in my humble opinion.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I recently went to a Nickelback concert and Three Days Grace was opening for them. I fell in love with the band hearing their music at the concert and felt that Nickelback should opening for Three Days Grace, not the other way around! <br /> <br />Top Songs for me: Animal I Have Become, Pain, It's Not Over, Never Too Late, and Get Out Alive
B00005RIKI|5.0|What can I say .. this is one of Lynyrd Skynyrd's classic CDs. A must for any collection.
B00001OH7P|4.0|I was in a restaurant when I heard this album being played and it really brought back memories.  I used to listen to it as a teenager and I knew I'd enjoy listening to it again as an adult.  It didn't disappoint!  Classic Bowie!
B000HT386M|5.0|Sandler continues to select comendies that almost always leaves the audience with something to think about.  This movie is probably best described as a modern version of it's a wonderful life and it's message is just a poignant as Jimmy Stewart pleading that he \\"wants to live\\".  Many can relate to living on auto-pilot, wanting to fast-forward through struggles and fights, but it often those things which build character.  A good movie with a great message.  Highly recommended.
B000NA2776|5.0|One of these year's excellent breakout albums, Mika's Life in Cartoon Motion is a perfect example of what pure fun pop candy is all about. While some might argue that Mika's voice is uncannily similar to Jake Shears of the Scissor Sisters or his music is absolutely frivolous, Mika is undoubtedly ingenious and talented to produce an album wild with abandonment and totally not self-conscious.<br /><br />Singles like Grace Kelly and Love Today bask themselves in Mika's falsetto, riotous beats, funky wailing and irrelevant lyrics. Mika gets a little cheeky on Lollipop with lyrics like 'sucking too hard on your lollipop, or love's gonna get you down.' Not to mention some of that 80's sensibilities.<br /><br />Love it or loathe it! No in-betweens. (A)
B00003CX95|5.0|Twelve years and this film still holds up remarkably well.  Mel Gibson, in my humble opinion, is a wonderful filmmaker.  I remember being blown away in the theatre at what he was able to pull off.  Seems the Mad Max films taught Gibson well.  There are definite paralles to Wallace and Max.  The fight for freedom is always a good fight and despite the gory end, Wallace was truely victorious.  Highly recommended.
B000Q76K24|1.0|One of the most boring, uneventful, and dull movies I have ever watched.  A total waste of time.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is the best period drama yet!!! The acting is simply superb! <br />For Richard Armitage, this was the role of his life and you can tell how much work and research he put into this performance to get it just perfect! He is brilliant and gripping as Mr. Thornton and his portrayal captures the fine balance of this character between the strong and tough tradesman on the outside and the noble, warm-hearted man he is in his private life.  <br />I wish more casting directors would acknowledge the amazing talent of Richard Armitage... <br />
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Another good one from Norah. She is so smooth and delightful. You will love this one as much as her others. This is one of her best. She is so sweet and that voice of hers. Such a relaxing experience to hear her.
B002WSASIC|5.0|Edward Norton is at his best. Great movie.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Love love love Michael Buble.. this is another great one. I think he is just wonderful. I listen to him all the time, albeit in the car or on the computer with headphones. His band is wonderful. He is such a success and getting better with every CD. What a delight to have this kind of talent.
B0000027I6|5.0|This album receives much criticism from \\"Pink Floyd\\" fans, who after knocking this amazing album probably pop in \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" and descend into the abyss of cheesy guitar solos and empty lyrics that is the post Roger Waters \\"Pink Floyd\\" (note the quotation marks). This album is proof that, after Syd left the band, Roger Waters WAS Pink Floyd. His band mates had an amazing sound, and they gave life to his visions, but he gave each record after Dark Side its concept, its substance, its life. On Pros and Cons, and Radio KAOS, Roger has trouble capturing the Floyd's sonic grace, but on Amused to Death, he captures the spirit of the Floyd perfectly. As Such, I consider this a Pink Floyd record, the first to come out after \\"The Final Cut\\" (another amazing record and a must listen if you enjoy this album). Jeff Beck is on Par with Gilmour on this album, especially on tracks like \\"What God Wants\\" (pts 1&3). This record is a tour de force, Roger Waters' requiem for the human race, and its message is still relevant a decade later. This is not an easy album to love, it takes repeated listens to understand its message, and by listens, I mean sitting down, listening to the entire record and thinking thorough each track, as another reviewier put it perfectly, you must give this record as much thought as Mr. Waters gave it to understand and love it. I recently saw Roger in Atlanta on his Dark Side tour, and it was indeed a Pink Floyd concert. David Gilmour fought Roger for the rights to use the Pink Floyd name, and after winning, released two albums, one Horrid, and one mediocre. Roger Waters, however, on albums like this, and on his exceptional tours, keeps the Floyd alive, despite Gilmour having hijacked the name. Thank you Roger, for your vision, your talent, and for the years of amazing music that is your gift to the world. Rock on Roger, keep the Floyd alive, and save us from \\"On An Island.\\"
B000O179A4|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie, but was disappointed in finding a wandering minstrel. Who was the hero? What was the story? Where was it going, and did it ever arrive? I was so bored I fast-forwarded through many of the musical numbers, and would have fast-forwarded through the rest, but I kept hoping I'd figure it out. I never did. Of course, it is possible that I finally got so bored that I fast-forwarded to the end and totally missed the point, but I don't think so. For a film that had so much potential to be really good, this was a bummer. In my opinion. And this has nothing to do with race. I love a movie where ordinary or extraordinary blacks overcome white-supremacist obstacles and rise to heights not formerly expected of them. But this film left me feeling cheated. Sorry. I really, really wanted to be in the cheering squad, and I found myself hissing instead. What went wrong?
B000002I25|5.0|This is the first album  by the Doors. I can remember hearing the \\"Short Version of Light my Fire on the radio back in 1967 when the album was first released. If you were lucky and had an FM radio station like we did in the LA Area then you could hear the \\"Long Version\\"  Light my Fire was not written by Jim Morrison but guitarist Robby Krieger instead and remains one of the Masterpieces of Rock.  The rest of the album also contains classics such as \\"The Crystal Ship\\", 20th Century Fox, Soul Kitchen, Whiskey bar and the Long and drawn out The End  If you are new to the music of the Doors, this is absolutely the place to start, personally I would buy this even before I would buy a Greatest Hits CD.................Enjoy
B000NDI3SK|5.0|I watched this series on television when it first came out, and I have been waiting for it to it to come out in an affordable package.  When it did, I immediately bought it. <br /> <br />The science is, in places, a bit dated, but that is to be expected.  When the DVDs arrived and I watched them, I initially realized that one thing that had changed was me in that I had managed to learn a lot in the years since the series was first broadcast.  This does not detract from the product and it is still well worth the price.  What is important, I think, is the attitude exhibited by Dr. Bronowski.   <br /> <br />I am leaving this series to my grandchildren in my will in the hope that it will influence them as positively as I believe it influenced me. <br /> <br />In two words - buy this.
B00006D295|5.0|When I first heard about this movie I was extremely skeptical. Later, when I watched clip on the Internet that featured a man dressed in fish-net stockings and a corset, and with heavy makeup, singing about being a \\"sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania\\", I was even more skeptical. However, I decided to rent it anyway. It was something that would not stop bothering me until I had seen the whole thing.<br /><br />When the film opened with a pair of large red lips singing about various classic science fiction/horror movies, I wondered what I had gotten myself into. However, as the film progressed, despite the countless disturbing occurrences, I found my self laughing. I even found myself enjoying it. I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but the movie was extremely entertaining and very funny. Something about it is just good. Maybe it's the uniqueness, maybe it's Tim Curry's brilliant acting that pulls it off, maybe it's something else. But whatever it is, this movie is extremely disturbing (probably the most disturbing movie you will ever see), but it is also extremely entertaining and hilarious! You must see this movie at least once in your life.
B000J103X4|5.0|The game's \\"doctors advocate\\" showcases game's ability to spit fire and the beats on this album are tight as hell...I dont realy care bout his beef wit ras kass cause to me ras & game are both great lirycist but i still prefer ras kass over game. Still doctors ad is highly recommended cause im glad game chose to part ways wif those snitches of g unit and 50. U kno 50 is a snitch. Peace !
B000OCXF0Q|3.0|There are tons of little girls and their mothers who love and support Avril. I don't think it helped her to add language that parents don't want their children to learn to use. I sent one of these sets to a cousin and after I heard the CD and DVD, I apologized to her mother.   The DVD is filled with the \\"F\\" word from start to finish. The CD also uses it and other language inappropriate for little kids. I understand that this CD is the unedited one and there is another available for children, but as I recall, kids like to own the real thing. She could have kept it clean-\\"er\\". What's the point of sabotaging her new album for the sake of asserting her freedom to say a few dirty words?    I just changed my mind. What I said before about the little kids and their mothers is true, but I just listened to the songs in the album again, and I find that Avril's use of those words also accentuate her buoyant spirit and her spunkiness. Let's face it, she's charmed me with her looks, her voice and her music..
B000ENV2QE|4.0|Maybe it's because drum machine and sampler technology caught up with them...or maybe that Martin was in an especially sultry mood. Masses marks the moment Depeche Mode really find their second incarnation, consolidating the successes of Black Celebration, moving from industrial clang to sultry slink. Thank god for the Emulator and digital synths, because the boys put them to very good effect here. And David Bascombe's production rounds out a great collection of thematically connected songs. (They're all about the sex drive and its dull motivations, boys and girls). The only thing more impressive would be what follows: an astonishingly perfect synthpop album...or is it rock album?...called Violator.
0812550706|5.0|I learned a lot from this book. I manage a team of people in a vary stressful environment and this book actually helped me think of things differently. Crazy, huh? Well, give the book a try, I'm sure you'll think of things a little differently afterwards.
0393061310|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. Though, it's the kind of book where you'll want to read an entire chapter in one sitting, because if you pick it up and put it down (reading only a few pages at a time), you'll get lost in the dense subject matter of each chapter.<br /><br />I'd add this to any list of \\"must read before you die\\" non-fiction books, as it will greatly affect how you view yourself in this world. Awesome.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|I own everything she has ever released, and this is a worthy addition to the collection.  If you are a first timer - start with Come Away With Me as it stands out, but this has some great moments.
B000NJCRAY|3.0|A little too radical of a reinvention of the IRON MAN mythology for my tastes, but other than that, I thought it worked well. The animation is also not the best for a project of this caliber. But all in all, I had a good time watching it even if at times, it can drag. If you're looking for a better Marvel animated film, check out either of the ULTIMATE AVENGERS films, especially the second one. IRON MAN is about a 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great movie, I can't add much to the already positive reviews. although I wish a colorised version was available. I never would have said that 10 or more years ago. But Colorization has come a long way. For purists a dual black and white-color version would be awesome. See legend films if you think it can't or shouldn't be done.
B000001GAM|5.0|This is without a doubt the pinnacle of Giulini's great career, and an achievement that can not be enough praised.  We are so fortunate to have this interpretation and performance of Bruckner's magnificent 9th symphony, which is simply without peers.  Giulini's performance of Bruckner's 9th is such a deeply moving performance of an utterly beautiful, terrifying, lonely, and majestic piece of music that can't fail to shake you to your core--while taking you somewhere beyond.
B000J10EQU|4.0|Bryan Singer did a great job, I thought Brandon Routh was excellent,  <br />Lois Lane(Kate Bosworth)is a good actress but to \\"Katherine hepburn\\" for me. Kevin spacey was very good, although I prefer the \\"Non crazy\\" cool <br /> Lex of the animated series and smallville etc.. to the movie Lex. <br />I thought they would start the series over which I would have prefered. <br />The symbolism to Jesus needs to end. Even if someone had super powers he's not God and doesn't have God's attributes. My dream Superman movie would be the cast of Smallville although I doubt they would want to be type cast, especially Tom Welling.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Lots and lots of great material.  You'll easily spend a couple of hours in these discs before you even come to the concert itself. <br /> <br />It's a new mix of the video, from what I understand.  My only complaint, same as the old VHS version, is now magnified by the increased size of TVs.  The band's set and props create a beautiful visual setting, but you need to be back a few hundred feet to even see it all.  While the special effects are blowing the audience's mind, we get LONG closeup shots of a bunch of average looking guys standing around on a stage.  Several times they went for the fabulous long shot, and took the guitar frets closeup and inset it down in the corner.  Wish they'd done that a lot more.  If you've got a six foot TV, you really don't want to see the entire screen filled with a guitar player's face, especially when you're missing lasers and rockets and 100 foot video images.
074356619X|5.0|The secret is a great compilation of the teachings of many all through history. The author has done a suburb job of putting them all together in a format that I read over and over. I love that the author not only learned the secret for her life but put so much effort into spreading the word. I think everyone should read this, even teach these concepts in school! What a wonderful world we live in! Thanks
0070511136|5.0|Great Book.  Good buy for any sales professional who has to use the phone at work.
B00029QXAK|4.0|It is not an ordinary film; it's very odd in the expression of what would be a 'movie' or film setting because it's so simple and cubic for the set. But it actually fits well as long as the viewers really concentrate on seeing each twist and turn.  It makes sense to 'see pass what a simple surface, like those extremely simplified house units, to see what's inside whether it's a house or a person'  Those characters (those appeared to be 'normal & boring persons') first even became friends with Grace (by Nicole Kidman), then they all ended up manipulating her, betrayed her, and even went so far to abuse her in many ways other than just rape.  It's about revealing human natures in its darkest sides and worst deeds to another who's at the very convenience to become a slave, or a victim, or simply a 'useful multi-functional yet so humiliated person' to other humans who were truly not so human-kind.  I also further applaud for directing and illustrating such violent & disturbing scenes without those cheesy 'in-your-face' kind of nudity.  No matter what, a viewer knows what's going on and the actress did not have to reveal obvious body parts to make a point.  ---That's call story-telling, directing, and acting with just clever plays.   <br />I think the plot is brilliant.  For the 1st hour I almost wanted to give up watching, but guess what, the twist and turn kept me shocked and my blood boiled in anger and sadness when those men raped Garce and they went on to behave 'normally' as usual . I wanted to see how Grace survived all this till the end. And you'll have to see it yourself to really find the meaning of 'DogVille'. <br />Overall, the film is worth watching and not to mention Nicole Kidman did more than a wonderful acting to penetrate deep into the character and carried out the story so well. I shed tears for Grace and it was so heart-breaking to feel her suffering and watch her miserable path. <br />Regular movie Joes wouldn't like this at all.  Serious film-studying enthusiastic must watch and collect this masterpiece.
B000002H33|5.0|Alright, I bought this album last month, with no Metallica music on my iPod except for 'Whiskey in the Jar' from Garage inc. It was only fiteen bucks, so I grabbed it. I popped it in and immediatly switched to Master of Puppets, the title track. After that, this has been in my CD player quite a bit(along with Led Zeppelin:Early Days and Latter Days and Black Rain). This is a great album. There should be no doubt in your mind whether to pickk it up or not. A recurring theme in the tracks are control and manipulation, but they're diverse enough so that it's more than one song. The liner notes have the lyrics inside, so you can sing along(good luck, these suckers are fast...) And now, time for a breakdown of the songs: <br /> <br />Battery: Great. Starts out pretty mellow, but gets heavier and proceeds to beat you into submission. <br /> <br />Master of Puppets: Great. Starts out heavy, then gets kinda' funky in the middle, and just when you think it's over, it punches you in the face and keeps marching. <br /> <br />The Thing The Should Not Be: Crap. This should be called The Song the Should Not Be. <br /> <br />Welcome Home(Sanitarium): Great. Pretty mellow, but like the mental patients it's about, it rises, stronger and stronger. <br /> <br />Leper Messiah: Great. <br /> <br />Orion: Great, and instrumental. <br /> <br />Damage Inc.: Alright. <br /> <br />I think that'sit, but if it isn't, I'll edit this review. Also, this album was number one in the 500 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of all time, so it must be doing something right. :)
B00006JJ51|5.0|You can not understate how good this album really is. It changed hip hop forever, it brought so much aggression and intensity to the listener that you can not help but get hooked. Ice Cube, the angry and politically charged MC, Eazy E, the boy from tha hood, MC Ren, the slick and ruthless MC, Dr. Dre, the deep toned MC and slick producer and DJ Yella, the beat banger, are the foundation for gangsta rap, comin Straight Outta Compton!
B0007M22TI|5.0|[[ASIN:B0007M22TI Celtic Woman]]This DVD was superb!I still play it over and over again.Not only are their vocals pure and flawless, but the instruments are amazing,especially Mairead on the fiddle! I have personally found this DVD to be soothing and therapeutic.I highly recommend that everyone buy a copy!
B00005AQE8|5.0|2Pac changed his style a bit from his previous release Me Against the World as he was now aligned with the most powerful hip hop label in the world, Death Row. He hits a grand slam for gangsta rap with this one. He shows his great aggression on the mic and collaborates extremely well with Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre to make classic joints like 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted and California Love. This is one of the greatest albums ever released not just from the West Coast, but hip hop in general.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Epitome of the nature of the game - sportsmanship.  Gentle movie dealing with the competition between two lowly-born men who were true gentlemen.  I love this movie as I love the game.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Wow what an extraordinary show. You get hooked pretty quickly from start to finish. What a woman Alison Dubios is she is a great mum, wife, lady, you feel jealous, amazed, and saddened by her ability at times. She seems to have a great family also, wish mine run as smoothly at times lol. What a great watch this is. Had to buy second series lol, Brilliant.
B000HBK3MM|3.0|I heard a song of hers and was immediately struck by the sophistication of her phrasing, the sound of her voice, the wisdom in the words of the song. Wanting to find out more, I read her bio and some reviews. Remarkable young lady. So wanting to hear some more, I ordered the CD. There are only a couple of songs on it that I would want to hear again. Disappointment. I gave the CD away.
B00005JKGO|5.0|It is difficult to imagine a deeper film than this. Fellini presents several existential choices for his main character, Marcello, played by the marvelous Marcello Mastroianni -- jet-set life (the visiting starlet and its possibilities), intellectual respectability (Steiner and company), religious ecstasy (the children's sighting of Mary), passionate love (the curious fling with Maddalena), bourgeois love (his needy girlfriend, Emma).<br /><br />As the film exposes each choice as a fraud, a farce, or a disaster, what does it mean to say Marcello is free to choose? He is trapped by too much rather than too little choice -- an elegant encapsulation of existentialism!<br /><br />So much for my attempt to unpack the film's meaning; the many memorable scenes, and the many subsequent films that allude to them, are the better reason to cherish it.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Who can make a bomb out of chewing gum?  With this video, you'll be brought back to the days when MacGyver and his trusty knife (Swiss Army knife) could get out of any situation.  Warning:  After years of watching, you will become an analytical thinker and will be able to help yourself think almost as creatively.  A fun, even if dated show.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|It's difficult to imagine any collector of war-based films not having this one on the shelf or in the DVD tray.  It is the true story of Alvin York, one of America's greatest war heros and patriots.  While the actual combat scenes are limited, when compared to the overall length of the film, it is a most powerful WWI story of a conscientious objector's battle with balancing his faith against his need to perform as a soldier.  I cannot think of an actor from that era who would have been more effective in the role than Gary Cooper, who was at his best in this touching film
B000FFJYB6|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie to watch with my 7-year-old son (and we watch a LOTTA movies together).  Not only is it completely delightful for both of us, it paves the way for some truly meaningful discussions.  When we first watched it together, and my son was younger, he simply enjoyed the antics of the boy-and-his-dog relationship; now that he's of the age to start asking tough questions, this movie opened the door to some shared revelations about racism and war, to name a few.  Parents be prepared, you may also need to explain what Moonshiners were (believe me, they're not portrayed in any glamorized fashion--in fact, they're the villains here).  More importantly, be prepared for the ending, at which point, if you have any semblance of a heart, you're probably going to make a blubbering fool of yourself in front of your kid (it gets me every time!).   <br /> <br />This is one of the few kid movies that doesn't pander to its prime audience.  Everyone loves this movie, and with good reason.  Buy it, don't think twice.
B000N6U0EC|5.0|Dramas are, well, dramatic at times.  The storyline here is very realistic...and it offers much hope with human struggle.  Will Smith is Academy Award material (perhaps his son too).  It'll (most probably!) jerk tears and make you laugh out loud...and hug your kid.  The BD (Blu-Ray) edition is, of course, significantly better.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Imagine a really complicated murder mystery of 1940s-ish noir like \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" set in modern American high school, and you will get \\"Brick,\\" first-time director Rian Johnson's experimental, but entertaining crime drama. Brendan, hard-boiled-type, Bogart-like high school student, is determined to find out the truths behind the death of his former girl-friend, and with a help from bespectacled buddy (Matt O'Leary), he confronts the thugs with knife and gun, and a grinning drug lord (Lucas Haas) while fending off the threat from the authorities ... not the police, but the vice-principal of the school. <br /> <br />This detective-story-in-high-school premise could have been a very bad joke with another director, but in fact the results are much better than you expect with strong acting of the cast, especially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt as hard-nosed Brendan, and sure-handed direction from Rian Johnson. It takes a while to get accustomed to the rhythm and mood of the film, and lots of slang too, but once you do, you find the film surprisingly engaging with the story of complicated mystery among a web of these eccentric characters. <br /> <br />Still I was a little disappointed with the film's female characters. There is no chemistry or sexual tension between Brendan and other female characters, especially with Laura played by Nora Zehetner in Chinese dress, and beautiful as she is, she is no Mary Astor. This kind of story needs a femme fatale, but how can you find a Barbara Stanwyck wearing an anklet in today's high school?  <br /> <br />\\"Brick\\" is perhaps a love-or-hate film with its bleak mood and dry humor. Whatever your reaction might be, it is true that \\"Brick\\" is very unique nonetheless.  <br />
B000P0J02E|5.0|Zimmer's score is as good as it gets.  If only as much care and attention had been given to the screenplay -- instead of pandering to the international audience to get the big bucks (there, I said it!) -- my God would they have had something.  As it is, the score is just about perfect and if you close your eyes as you listen to it, and use your imagination, you will be able to watch the movie that might have been.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|There are many classic, beloved Hollywood romances from the forties era which this movie reminded me of. Interestingly, in two different scenes in The Lake House, you are shown a black and white clip from a forties Cary Grant/Ingrid Bergman movie where they are sharing a passionate kiss. Two great screen lovers setting the tone for what its all about: love with a capitol L. You even get an education concerning Jane Austin's novel Persuasion concerning the value of the virtue of patience in waiting for your true love.<br /><br />This movie reminds me most of The Portait of Jenny, a lovely fantasy starring Joseph Cotton and Jennifer Jones. In that film, the character played by Jennifer Jones \\"grows up\\" right in from of Jospeh Cotton's eyes, and they fall in love when she becomes an adult. It has the same dreamy quality which The Lake House has. It plays with time, dancing back and forth, in the same manner, and the viewer cannot help but become engaged by the theme of time and all its potential concerning profound love. With that sort of true love, after all, why must there be rules?<br /><br />I got a good feeling immediately right from the beginning of this movie, as Sandra Bullock, who plays Kate, leaves the lake house with her dog, Jack, and pulls onto the road. I knew that something was up right away, as the rural landscape shifted subtlety, and it was clear that time had passed in some mysterious form...there was snow on the ground which hadn't been there a moment before. The seasons had changed in that instant, and the blue truck, which Keanu Reeves' character, Alex, drives throughout the movie, is seen coming in from a secondary road, headed toward the lake house.<br /><br />The viewer soon discovers that the main characters are both inhabiting the lake house exactly two years apart, and they begin to fall in love through the letters they leave for each other in the old mailbox at the top of the walkway to the house. They share Jack, the dog, but they can't seem to meet in what is called real time, as hard as they try. How will this be solved? Will love overcome the obstacle of right place, wrong time?<br /><br />As with the modern romance, Meet Joe Black, starring Brad Pitt, you must be willing to embrace non-reality totally. I grew up reading fairy tales, so I had a wonderful time watching this movie. I recommend it for many reasons. Not only did I think that the acting was good, and I liked watching Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, I enjoyed the fantastic visit to Chicago via the setting of the film. The Lake House is not solely set at the lake house, it is also set all over Chicago, and I mean ALL over that superb city. I am glad I got a chance to see that.<br /><br />If you like love stories, and you are willing to sit in suspended disbelief for an hour and a half of sweet escapism, try this film.

032147404X|5.0|This book helped not only get started with my first SLR, but it also was great suggesting equipment and other things to consider while out shooting. The different subjects covered may not all relate to your focus, but there is something for everyone. Scott's humor keeps the book offbeat and fun to flip through. I keep it in my gear bag always and refer back to whenever I need to. Worth so much more than you'll pay!
0142403873|5.0|Not much to say about it.  The kids absolutely love the book and so do I.  The rhythym of the words is captivating as well as the content. <br /> <br />The story is of a mouse who is walking through the \\"deep dark wood\\" and comes across the very 'monster' that he was making up. <br /> <br />In the end, everyone parts ways.  No bloodbath or anything.  What I like best about the book is that the other animals 'invite' the mouse for lunch(snake, owl, etc).  They kind of hint that he is the lunch but don't come right out and say it.  Not only is this better for kids as it leaves much to their imagination it adds to the story. <br /> <br />I have this book memorized. <br /> <br />
0802136834|5.0|I love this book and I hated history all through school--even in college. It reads almost like a novel. I can't put it down! It's giving me a new perspective on history and it makes me want to learn even more about other times as well. Now I want to plan a trip to England. I'd recommend this book to any history teacher or a parent who needs to instill an appreciation for history in their students.

B0002SROT0|5.0|Like Alice in Wonderland, \\"From a Basement\\" leads the listener into a world where things are just slightly askew, but strangely beautiful and awe-inspiring at the same time. \\"Basement\\" was my first introduction to Elliott Smith and I was instantly hooked, lured into the music by easily recognizing the heavy influence of The Beatles, and being reminded in more than one cut of the dream-like essence of Pink Floyd. Now here was someone that had my attention ! Of course, by then, Elliott had sadly been long gone. Having gone back and listened to the earlier cds prior to \\"Basement\\", I understand why some of his long-time fans were puzzled a bit by this release. It is a break from his traditional style, but does follow the path set by  \\"Figure 8\\". Each track on \\"Basement\\" has its own allure, and you may find that it is a cd that takes multiple listenings before you realize that lyrically and musically it has gotten under your skin and nothing will do except to hear it again and again. A beautiful piece of work, and one that will make you wonder just how far Elliott could have transported us had he not been taken from us way too soon.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|John Cameron Mitchell has got to be one of our best, modern day visionaries.  After Hedwig, I didn't think he could create a piece of art as good but Shortbus delivers.  A completely different piece than Hedwig, Mitchell as assembled an extremely talented cast to deliver a real (and I mean REAL) story.  Two standouts here are Sook Yin Lee (Sofia) who is a disovery combining earthiness, intelligence, beauty and sexuality.  She grounds the whole film and allows the other characters to orbit around her giving us an amazing tapestry of art.  Paul  Stoval (as James) can communication waves of emotion with the merest facial expression. If I ever meet this man, I will hug him whether he likes it or not.  :) <br /> <br />This is the kind of movie that stays with you long after it ends.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|It's widely agreed that the last time Megadeth put out an actual metal album, CDs were packaged in cardboard letterboxes and cassette tapes were still music's industry standard. While parts of 2001's 'The World Needs A Hero' and 2004's 'The System Has Failed' merely revisited  Mustaine and co's  thrash metal roots, 'United Abominations' fully embraces and completely revitalizes the devastating, highly technical style of metal that put Megadeth on the map over 20 years ago. <br /> <br />Tightly focused and driven by a clear sense of purpose, the album exudes plenty of traditional thrash goodness: complex riffage, double kick pedal percussion, harmonized lead guitars, and abrupt tempo changes. Hearing Mustaine and lead guitarist Glen Drover exchange guitar solos like gunfire while drummer Shawn Drover switches up time signatures for the third time in a single song is enough to lay all doubt to rest. 'United Abominations' is the album Megadeth fans have been waiting 15 years for. <br /> <br />The incredible musicianship on Abominations is given added urgency by the album's themes of war profiteering and the U.N.'s failure to prevent atrocities across the globe. When Mustaine raises his voice above some of the most complex instrumentation of his career to spew lyrics like \\"We're only a war away from Amerikhastan\\", Megadeth's newfound relevancy can't be denied. <br /> <br />Unfortunately two things keep 'United Abominations' from complete perfection. One is the inclusion of a remake of 'A Tout Le Monde' from 1994's 'Youthanasia' featuring Lacuna Coil's Cristina Scabbia. While her remarkable vocal talents are more than welcome here, the song would have been better suited as a b-side, sounding painfully out of place in the context of the album. The other is an ill-concieved tie-in with the TV show '24' and subsequent partnership with 20th Century Fox, a company that's made no secret of its conservative Republican politics, making for a strange cross-marketing campaign foran album serving largely as a war protest. But if these arguably minor offenses are overlooked, it's impossible to deny that 'United Abominations' is one of the best albums of Megadeth's near-quarter century long career and certainly the best metal album of 2007 so far.

0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins, famed Oxford evolutionist, offers in this book a tour of the various topics relevant to the question of the reasonableness of atheism, and the unreasonableness of theism.  He offers a critical discussion of the traditional proofs of the existence of God, an evolutionist's understanding of the origins of religion, a discussion of the relationship (or in his view lack thereof) between morality and religion, to name just a few of the topics discussed in full or touched on in passing. <br /> <br />His intended audience is not simply quasi-theistic fence-sitters (he admits that he has little chance of convincing staunch theists), but also fellow scientifically trained atheists who, out of a sense diplomacy, deny that science has anything to say about the truth-value of religious claim.  For Dawkins science has plenty to say about this.  Understandably, as an evolutionist, in his view the explanatory power of natural selection, and the continued success of the theory, cannot be ignored as providing powerful evidence against the notion of a supernatural \\"designer\\" of the natural world.  This, of course, is not new territory for Dawkins: he explored it in far greater detail in \\"The Blind Watchmaker.\\"  But here he branches out into new territory by, for example, discussing recent views in physics as a response to the so-called \\"anthropic argument\\" for divine agency. <br /> <br />One disappointment in the extended argument against the truth of theism, in my view, is his treatment of the traditional arguments for God.  In response to the traditionally called (since Kant) cosmological arguments, that contend that there must be a first cause of the natural world, Dawkins repeatedly asks, to paraphrase, \\"what explains God?\\"  The theological tradition has long had an answer to this question: \\"God explains himself.\\"  In general the idea is that existence is a necessary characteristic of God.  Thus just as a dog must have certain characteristics to be a dog and nota rabbit, God must have existence.  But there is a powerful response to this view that Dawkins does not embrace.  Modern logic of the form developed by Bertrand Russell and others, and that has been unanimously embraced by logicians, denies that existence is a description of anything.  I call this a \\"disappointment\\" since I would wish the strongest argument put forth, but of course Dawkins the evolutionist cannot be blamed for ignorance of modern logic (he is after all, denying omniscient intelligence!). <br /> <br />Dawkins also discusses the effects of religion on society, and individuals within it: the stupifying effect of creationism and the more recent \\"irreducible complexity\\" view on scientific education, the attacks on homosexuality, and of course the danger, unfortunately witnessed in daily headlines today, of the violent effects of religious fanaticism.  I think he makes a compelling case that religion historically, and currently, can hardly make a case for moral superiority.  For me, the most unconvincing of Dawkins' arguments is when he contends that religious parents are to, if not condemned, at least chided for the indoctrination of their children.  It is hard to place blame on parents teaching children what they themselves sincerely believe, and it is hard to argue against the sincere belief of religious parents.  The few examples he offers of children being traumatized by the threat of hell and damnation hardly make the case.  In my own case, my parents were sincerely religious, but I never heard from them in my memory any reference to going to hell.  To make the argument, Dawkins would need to show that my experience is the exception rather than the rule. <br /> <br />In sum the great value of Dawkins' contribution, and others like it, is to articulate the position of the atheist.  Theists have done this for millennia.  Consider the hundreds of creeds generated by Christians alone.  Atheists have been far less verbose.  The various scattered commentsthat Dawkins quotes from Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, for example, attest to this.  One effect of this, I believe, is that theists have not understood the sincerity of the scattered pronouncements of atheists.  The long practice of religious officiants waiting for death-bed confessionals from avowed atheists seems to attest for this.  While atheists recognize committed theists, the opposite seems often not to be true.  And I wonder what mischief this makes.  The theist harbors the thought that the atheist is deliberately ignoring what they \\"really\\" believe (God and afterlife), and condemns the atheist for hypocrisy.  Dawkins makes no bones about it: he is a sincere and committed atheist, and this should dispel (if only theists would read this book) any doubt that atheists really believe what they say.
B00005JPQP|4.0|\\"Ocean's Eleven\\" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I really enjoyed \\"Ocean's Twelve.\\" Unfortunately, I don't think \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" measures up to the first two installments in this movie trilogy, although aspects of the film were quite enjoyable.<br /><br />In the latest Ocean adventure, the gang rallies together after vile casino owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) double-crosses Reuben (Elliott Gould). Led by Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan (George Clooney and Brad Pitt), the con men devise a massive plot to rig Willy's new casino on its opening night and cause the house to lose for three and a half minutes straight, thus breaking Willy Bank's bank.<br /><br />The premise of the story is great, and I love the fact that this scam is set in Las Vegas, just like the first film. This time the group is forced to enlist the help of their longtime nemesis, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), which adds a fun new twist to the situation. However, in spite of all that good stuff, I was still disappointed with this film. The first hour or so really dragged for me. There aren't a whole lot of subplots going on like in the first two films, and everyone's attention is focused on the technical details of planning the scam, which gets kind of old after a while. The fact that the characters of Tess and Isabel are absent from this film also takes away from everything. I knew that Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones weren't slated to appear in the film, but I was still hoping for a cameo, at least. There weren't really any fun cameos in this movie, unlike the first two films, which was a major bummer. Many of the jokes didn't seem as funny this time around, and although the pace really picked up once the con officially was underway, it just wasn't as fun of a movie as the first two were.<br /><br />Another complaint I have about \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is that it's an incredibly predictable movie. Everyone knows that no one's going to trump Danny Ocean and his crew, and even when seemingly unbeatable obstacles spring up or integral characters start getting arrested, we know it's all part of the plan and that the scam will go off without a hitch. Many of the casino staff members and FBI officials are in on the scheme, too, but that wasn't a surprise at all because the same trick was used in the first two films on multiple occasions.<br /><br />Still, all my griping aside, I enjoyed the film. Things really picked up after the first hour or so, and there are some very funny scenes in the movie (unfortunately, though, I think most of them ran in the trailer). The Danny/Rusty/Oprah crying scene is hilarious, as is the little \\"inside joke\\" scene at the very end with Pitt and Clooney. All of the actors did a great job. Pacino is a very nice addition to the cast, as is Ellen Barkin, although I think her character was kind of watered down and could have been a lot stronger. Also, the Vegas shots are great. I especially like the scene where Rusty and Danny are conversing outside of the Bellagio: there are some beautiful shots of the Strip in this film, which makes Vegas lovers like myself very happy.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think the main problem with this film is that the script is very weak, which is a shame. Fortunately, everything manages to come together in the end, and Clooney and his costars make the movie entertaining to watch.pring up or integral characters start getting arrested, we know it's all part of the plan and that the scam will go off without a hitch.

You were gone and the finale wasn't the part that mattered. We are all circling the drain, he thought. Some are closer to the black hole than others.

1594489505|5.0|If I was capable of staying awake 24 hours and ignoring my family to read this book I would have.  It grabbed me instantly and I was transfixed.  I saw Khaled Hosseini on BookSpan last week being questioned about The Kite Runner (which I also just absolutely loved) and went the next morning to buy this book.  Just like with The Kite Runner I had moments when I had to put the book down to let what I just read sink in (or reach for a tissue).  Hosseini is an incredibly talented storyteller.  I was so moved by the plight of the citizens of Afghanistan.  I was a child and then a teenager during the time of this story so I was completely oblivious to everything they went through.  It certainly wasn't being taught in our schools.  And to know that he used real stories he collected from women when he went over there made it all the more heartbreaking.  You cannot help but be moved by this book.
0553381695|5.0|With this second novel in his Song of Ice and Fire series, George R R Martin has done with few writers have pulled off--written a book that's as good (if not better) as the one before. And that is especially important when the book boasts nearly 1000 pages.  <br /> <br />The storyline is more complex this time, introducing two more characters that offer their point of view. There already is a cast of several dozens and I'll admit that it can get frustrating trying to remember who's who, but for that GRRM has an updated House Tree at the back, listing in orderly fashion who belongs to what House.  <br /> <br />Unlike the later Wheel of Time books, GRRM takes us to strange and foreign places without inundating us with every little custom and describing every bolt of cloth. He just puts out enough to make you feel like you're there and then gets back on track with the plot. It's fair to say that more events actually happen in this one book than in the past few Wheel of Time books. Just about every chapter ends with a bang. <br /> <br />Sea battles, braving the cold northern regions, walking across deserts and finding deserted cities, politics, bold escapes, dark magics, secret passages, assassinations: If these are your cups of tea (or poison) then this book is for you and highly recommended.
B000ENV2P0|5.0|I have been a Peppers fan almost all of my life, and, so, I have pretty high expectations from them, ya' know? Anyway, almost every song on this album was stupendous. Yeah, stupendous, and I don't even use that word, much less anyone else. I think, that all the songs that they tried to get back to their roots, although incomplete breakthrough, were great nonetheless. Such titles as 'Torture Me' and 'Strip My Mind', were quite unique, considering RHCP's normal upbeat style, and were done quite well, reminenscing the times of 'Otherside' and similiar songs. All the singles? Fantastic. A couple of songs of noteworthy are 'Hey', 'Charlie', '21st Century', 'Turn It Again', and 'Death Of A Martian', the last one have an amazing spoken poem by Anthony, making a great finale for the whole album. The special edition's bonus disc is quite good, but, I really reccomend it more for the bigger fans of RHCP, that still like 'em, as well as the other little stuff that it came with. I have to admit, I love the little top it came with, I thought it was cool, and also the little optical illusion cards it came with, for the top. Anyway, if you like pop music, if you like fast bass lines, if you like a little hippty hop with some singity bop, you should get this album.

B000001E3L|5.0|I never was the hugest Van Morrison fan. I knew the hits on the radio, & just from that I could tell he touched on a wide range of genres; Rock & Roll, Light Rock, Contemporary, jazz. At one time in New Orleans, it was near impossible NOT to hear \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" 10 times a day, & I quickly got burnt out & stopped my Van Morrison explorations before I really got started. Now, there have been several bands which I had touched on in the same way, (Springsteen, Little Feat, Tom Petty, Rush) & once I heard them live I went CRAZY over them, so when this was reccomended to me by Amazon, I figured, Why not? MAN, AM I GLAD I CHECKED THIS OUT!!! This blows his studio material AWAY!!! The band has a much bigger, fuller sound, & it sounds as if he took all of the styles I forementioned, added blues to the mix, & combined them all to make a new SUPER-GENRE!! It also has the benefit of making you FEEL like you're THERE!! It sounds like Van is a MASTER SHOWMAN who is determined to give his fans something extra when they come to see him! His voice seems to have gotten a little deeper with age, (WHO'S HASN'T) but it's just as strong & soulful as ever!!If you want to hear what Van Morrison can really do, or even if you just appreciate good music & want to hear something new, CHECK THIS OUT!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000MXPE7O|5.0|It's amazing that this film is so highly regarded, especially since we have Matt Damon as the lead character. Damon isn't known for his exciting acting abilities (with the exception of [[ASIN:0788814664 Good Will Hunting]] which I consider his quasi-breakout role). He's established himself as Jason Bourne in the [[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity]] franchise, but that doesn't take much acting ability and is almost purely a physical job. His character in the [[ASIN:B000062XHI Ocean's Eleven]] just seems to go through the motions. He's had limited success in films like [[ASIN:B00001ZWUS Saving Private Ryan]] and [[ASIN:B000M5AJQS The Departed]]. I say \\"limited\\" because it was the other characters and screenplay that brought him recognition more than his own abilities (try imagining Saving Private Ryan without Tom Hanks or The Departed without Leonardo DiCaprio and you'll see what I mean.) So I wasn't drawn to this flick simply because I knew Damon was our main man. But I was wonderfully surprised.<br /><br />Damon was the perfect choice for this role, and that isn't necessarily a compliment. His portrayal of Edward Wilson is flat, ineffectual, and unremarkable, just like the character was supposed to be. Just like many of Damon's previous portrayals. It is this absurd, unemotional character that drives the entire film, and thanks to director/actor Robert DeNiro's relentless pursuit of this movie (it was his pet project for over ten years) we have a gem.<br /><br />Beginning with Robert Kennedy's disastrous Bay of Pigs debacle, the film shows Ed Wilson (Damon) trying to overcome an American/Cuban historical event that many find shameful. The CIA had a leak somewhere that blew the entire assault, and Wilson has to find out who and how. It will take him back to the very beginnings of the CIA, pre-WWII, and then slowly catch up to the1960's.<br /><br />Battling the Cold War with a very worthy Russian opponent, Ed must come to grips with the death of his father (who was an OSS spy in WWI), the loveless relationship with his wife (played by Angelina Jolie), and what he's prepared to do for his son (Eddi Redmayne) when he learns of ignorant betrayal from within.<br /><br />The film really looks at the development of the CIA, how it came to be, what spying is REALLY like (not James Bond-ish), and one man's unwavering support for his country. Dark corners are everywhere, including Ed Wilson's own home. Life and business blur. Separating the man from the mission becomes impossible. A panoply of scenes greets each moment of Ed's life, from the shadowy corners of Post-WWII Berlin to the recesses of his home sanctuary. It's an incredible display with truly gripping photography and a frightening descent into the world of phantom spies.<br /><br />A powerhouse cast graces the screen, with fine performances from such greats as John Turturro ([[ASIN:B000GBK904 Thirteen Conversations About One Thing]]), Joe Pesci and William Hurt ([[ASIN:B000F7CMRM Syriana]]).<br /><br />Surprisingly THE GOOD SHEPHERD has made it up to one of my all-time favorite spy films. But a warning call must be sound here. This isn't your typical spy flick. It won't be for everyone. But if you like to think about where the CIA came from and how espionage jobs really work, this one will be high on your list, too.(who was an OSS spy in WWI), the loveless relationship with his wife (played by Angelina Jolie), and what he's prepared to do for his son (Eddi Redmayne) when he learns of ignorant betrayal from within.   <br /> <br />The film really looks at the development of the CIA, how it came to be, what spying is REALLY like (not James Bond-ish), and one man's unwavering support for his country.

It's an incredible display with truly gripping photography and a frightening descent into the world of phantom spies.  <br /> <br />A powerhouse cast graces the screen, with fine performances from such greats as John Turturro ([[ASIN:B000GBK904 Thirteen Conversations About One Thing]]), Joe Pesci and William Hurt ([[ASIN:B000F7CMRM Syriana]]).  <br /> <br />Surprisingly THE GOOD SHEPHERD has made it up to one of my all-time favorite spy films. But a warning call must be sound here. This isn't your typical spy flick. It won't be for everyone. But if you like to think about where the CIA came from and how espionage jobs really work, this one will be high on your list, too.
1582701709|2.0|When you realize that talented speakers are able to pull in ten to twenty thousand a pop for a public or corporate speaking engagement, you might understand why a bunch of self-styled gurus would get together and produce a product like this. If you buy their ideas, you're more likely to also buy a ticket the next time they're at a venue near you. I have read 12-15 books on quantum physics in the last few years. Maybe I missed something, but outside of reading that quantum particles achieve a definite state only when we decide to look at them, I don't recall any of the physicists saying there is evidence that we can manipulate these particles in a controlled manner to follow our whims. If you believe that positive thinking is a desirable action, this book my well serve as a method to discipline, but if you believe that believing is all that's required to realize your desires, the universe has some big surprises for you! This is unsubstantiated fluff - another pseudo-religion being sold to the desperate and ignorant. Worst of all, like most other religions, it uses fear to manipulate: Wrong-thinking WILL be punished!
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Along with Fandango!, Tres Hombres is essential ZZ Top. There is one fantastic song after another on this recording, and while the FM staples might be what lures many in, it is the lesser known songs that sink the hook firmly in place. Precious and Grace, Hot, Blue, and Righteous, and Master of Sparks are all excellent songs that many have not heard before. The stinging, tasteful, and concise guitar work of Billy Gibbons can never be undervalued and perhaps one of the finer qualities of this master is how he never overplays. The band is always tight and razor sharp and this is an album that I never tire of. This is not only an essential Top album, it is a vital part of any rock fan's collection. ZZ Top is one of America's best bands and this brilliant cd demonstrates why.<br />As for the newer expanded cd it includes three fair to average live takes on songs herein. They have a somewhat muddy quality to them. Still they can't detract one iota from this album. Also noteworthy is the return to the original mix sans the over-the-top drums which was an inexplicable move akin to New Coke or painting a broad smile on the Mona Lisa.
0143034901|3.0|I loved the beginning of this novel. The language is so beautiful, you'd never guess it's a translation. I loved the portrayal of the city, partly because in my one trip to Europe, Barcelona was my favorite city. I liked the main characters, and was intrigued by the original plot. But I never cared very much about the story as it developed. I was waiting for it to pick up, reading well more than half the book, but the book did not pick up for me. So it's a very mixed review from me.<br /><br />  The author reminded me of Umberto Eco, in both his strengths and weaknesses. Eco's stories ultimately were more gripping.

B000FGGE7C|4.0|Good movie, done in a very stylish, classy way.  I enjoyed it and will certainly watch it again. Some of the computer generatic graphics weren't that good, but most of them were, so it didn't detract from the movie.  My only pet peeves are that some of the fight scenes seemed a bit unrealistic, with no explanation of how she suceeded, and the other thing is that soft focus is used on the faces sometimes.  It's annoying when the rest of the frame is sharp. but you can't see detail in the faces, especially annoying with such a beautiful woman in the picture. <br /> <br />The plot and script is not quite as good as Equilibrium, but I had fun watching it and it is enjoyable nonetheless.
1582701709|1.0|While I would be happy to read a book that was legitimately about the capacity and propensity of positive thinking to create opportunities for success, this book was a complete and utter attack on rational thought. It suggests one should never think about anything negative in their lives for fear that they might attract it. It claims you can not even think about not wanting such things because that, too, will bring negativity into your life. It's embarassing that we live in a culture where a book denouncing thought and rational decision making can be so popular.

B00006JKLI|5.0|The \\"Yes - Fragile\\" album is such a classic!  After the huge success of \\"The Yes Album\\", five musicians (Anderson, Bruford, Howe, Squire, and Wakeman) made history.  First each musician composed their own song with each one having individual ideas represented through amazing use of their instruments of choice.  Of course, \\"Roundabout\\" became the big hit, almost by surprise by the band members.  But other group songs like, \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" and \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" became famous FM and college campus classics.  This edition also includes a fantastic long rendition of Paul Simon's \\"America\\".<br /><br />Remixed (A great choice of an album to do it for) in DVD Surround Sound by Tim Weidner and Steve Hall, this album jumps out and about your living space with amazing sound and clarity.  One can only hope that more of \\"Yes\\" will be reproduced in this format.  DVD set also includes a photo gallery, lyrics and an animated \\"YES\\" timeline.  What else could one want?
B0001US62I|4.0|I saw this and thought it was one of the \\"style over substance\\" movies that were really beginning to emerge strongly back in the late 80s, though it was still fairly creepy. Nevertheless I've never really forgotten it, and was eager to see it again when I found it on DVD for $5.<br /><br />It's 1955 [I TOTALLY did not remember it as taking place in the 50s] and Mickey Rourke is Harold Angel, low-rent private detective. He is hired by Robert DeNiro as Louis Cyphere to find a singer called Johnny Favorite. He has vanished, and DeNiro wants to know if he's still alive.<br /><br />Already one can tell that this is a modern noir, what with the low-rent detective and all the shadows in the photography. Rourke finds that Favorite was checked out of the hospital he was supposedly in, and hunts down the doctor who was in charge. He interrogates him, then leaves for a while, and when he comes back the man is dead. So he begins to think that someone is following him, killing the people he talks to after he finds them. Upon hearing this, DeNiro ups the price to $5,000. Rourke's search leads him down to New Orleans, where he witnesses some creepy voodoo rituals and gets involved with the beautiful Lisa Bonet. Finally his search ends with a surprising revelation that really ruins his day.<br /><br />If you've never seen it, that's all I can tell you. If you like spooky movies with lots of atmosphere [it's not really scary, just very creepy all the way through], you should definitely check this out. It has good performances, a fairly tight script, and a good twist at the end. Okay, bye!<br /><br />SPOILERS > > ><br /><br />Okay, now for the rest of us who have seen it... I was interested to see how this would hold up after all these years, and particularly after knowing what was coming. I'm pleased to say that--it does! In fact, it may have a little more power and poignancy, as if you DON'T know what's happening you have to look back on everything, and it seems to me that your real satisfaction comes from looking back on the movie afterward. If you do know what's coming, you can admire DeNiro's devilish [arr! arr!] sadism in making Harry hunt himself, and have a little more feeling for the clueless Harry as his blas&eacute; world weariness is slowly drained away and he begins to really panic over what's going on.<br /><br />DeNiro was even better than I remembered [aside from looking HOT and exuding that whole `menacing mobster' thing that I like], especially after you know the story and realize that he is just toying with Harry from the start. His whole air of amused sadism and absolute still confidence really works. That said, in retrospect I think the movie kind of overdid the whole \\"I am Satan\\" thing with the extended shots of his pentagram ring and long fingernails and cane and throne and especially the \\"this egg represents the soul\\"...CHOMP scene. I can see how those things might seem evocative if you were just trying to piece this whole thing together, but even so I think it could have done with less of them. There's a note in the IMDb trivia that says DeNiro was doing an imitation of Martin Scorsese in his performance, but it doesn't say where that information came from. Anyway, good one Robert!<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is also fine. He handles his role without a hitch, but I think a lot of the mileage he gets out of it is due to the script and plot. Lisa Bonet is also on hand, presented in a very sexual way from the very beginning, when she appears in a wet t-shirt with her nipples out to HERE. And Charlotte Rampling is very well deployed as an imperious fortune teller, which works, as she seems so otherworldly anyway.<br /><br />One of the things I remember from watching it the first time is--well, Lavern Baker's recording of \\"Soul On Fire,\\" which has become a staple of my record collection--but also the extensive shots of FANS. At first I thought that was just a somewhat arbitrary piece of atmosphere, but in retrospect I think thefans receive a loving close-up [as opposed to just being around, as they are throughout] when Harry loses consciousness and becomes the person who is killing all of his informants. I would have to watch it again to make sure--which I'm not going to do for a while--but look for that and see what you think. My first clue about that was the shot showing the fan reversing direction shortly before Mickey finds the dead doctor.<br /><br />I watched this with my boyfriend, who had never seen it, and he figured out the twist about five minutes before it is officially revealed, which I think is perfect--you figure it out on your own, which is fun, just before it is revealed, so you don't have too long of knowing the secret while the movie thinks you're still in the dark, which is annoying.<br /><br />Anyway, it's still good! If you're interested in seeing how well it's constructed and admiring the performances in a way you can't really when you don't know what's going on, I'd definitely recommend giving this one another look.the fans receive a loving close-up [as opposed to just being around, as they are throughout] when Harry loses consciousness and becomes the person who is killing all of his informants.

B000000XCH|5.0|Great value. If you are into the 60s' and 70s' you will love this one.
0780628551|3.0|I liked it! It's slow, it's hypnotic and trippy, but be warned: it has no ending. You know my theory about how only the first 2/3rds of a movie are interesting? This film runs with that. It is all about tension and atmosphere, so lay back and enjoy that, because there is NO PAYOFF WHATSOEVER. You never find out what the aliens are really up to, no one wins in the end, nothing is resolved. You have to be prepared for the fact that the build-up and tension IS the movie.<br /><br />This movie has some very creepy and unnerving scenes, which I would say were similar to the tone of the first 3/4 of The Sixth Sense. With this movie you have to be prepared to follow the subtle changes in tone and atmosphere, and just go where they take you. I found the entire sequence where Charlize Theron initially finds out that something has happened on the shuttle to be very creepy. In fact much of the movie is very unnerving and slightly surreal, exploring the more sinister aspects of the idea that someone's DNA has merged with yours and now there's some new organism growing in your body.<br /><br />I basically went to see this because I like Johnny Depp and thought [this is pre-Secret Window] that he wouldn't purposely do a movie that was just stupid. His performance is very convincing, as usual. He's very cocky and sexy toward the beginning, in particular. I also think Charlize Theron is a VERY good actress [and this was pre-Monster], and she proves that again here. Yes, this is another version of the role she played in Devil's Advocate, but I suspect that the director saw how good she was in that and wanted her to essentially redo it for this. I think people who don't respect her acting are speaking out of the sexist idea that a woman who is that beautiful cannot possibly be talented.<br /><br />If you like very carefully controlled tension and great horror atmospherics, I would suggest you see this film. If you're looking for something along the lines of Species with slightly better actors, you're out of luck.ly better actors, you're out of luck.

B00005K3O0|2.0|Ugh. What a waste of a perfectly good evening. I was fairly excited about this as I love that whole vibe 70s supernatural thrillers have, I admire [some of] the work of Robert Wise, and this was also one of those movies I had seen once or twice at the age of 13, and it seemed pretty good then. It does NOT hold up.<br /><br />I watched the trailer before watching the movie, which is essentially the cover of the novel this came from, with a lot of talk about how this is the adaptation of the blockbuster novel... and that's exactly what this movie seemed like: an assured hit, so just make it seem like somewhat of a `prestige' picture, but no need to put a great deal more effort into it. This is also a painfully obvious rip-off of The Exorcist, especially in the appearance of the child, the mother-daughter dynamic, the multitude of `distraught mother' scenes, and the whole tone of urban spookiness it tries [with extreme effort] to appropriate. Perhaps the main reason to watch this movie is to appreciate the effortlessness with which The Exorcist achieves all of these effects, in contrast to what we have here. This movie also really highlighted for my what a great performance Ellen Burstyn gave in that movie, and how genuinely innocent and charming the young Linda Blair could be. Because it ain't here, that's for sure.<br /><br />Here's the deelio: Marsha and her hunky stud of a husband John Beck [more on him later] have a picture-perfect Manhattan life. But creepy Anthony Hopkins is always hanging around and staring at their daughter, Ivy. Marsha and husband get more and more creeped out, John even goes to the police, but no one ever thinks of just going up to the guy and just asking him what he wants. Anthony Hopkins doesn't exactly pose the greatest physical threat, and during this part we get the first glimmers of what turns out to be one of the major problems of this movie: it's just dragging itself out interminably just to... drag itself out. And I have to say that that pisses me off, and turns me against a movie. Anyway, so the whole first 30 minutes is spent finding excuses to drag out the low-level stalking.<br /><br />Then the couple meets with Anthony [who shaved his beard to help lose that \\"I'm a crazed stalker\\" look he was apparently going for?], and he informs them [in an extremely rambling way] that he believes that their daughter Ivy is the reincarnation of his daughter Audrey Rose. We have to wait quite a while more before he gets around to telling them what he WANTS, which is essentially to have visiting rights. I will say that Anthony turns in a good performance typical of his early career. But, even though Marsha's hunky stud husband mildly voices that he thinks this guy is nuts, the film tries to pretend like Anthony is making a fairly reasonable assertion, even though really the ONLY reasonable thing to think is that THIS GUY IS F***ING NUTS. There's a lot of instances I could mention but honestly I don't care enough to go through them. You could have a VERY interesting movie if the film took the perspective that the guy IS nuts, and he intrudes on this family's life and causes a bunch of problems, but no, what we have is an entirely gullible film that is banking on a 70s audience's leaning toward a belief in reincarnation. That it doesn't adequately consider alternate theories is another alienator from the film.<br /><br />So anyway, it seems that Ivy is having nightmares--proof positive that she's the reincarnation of another girl, don't you think? At least that's what Marsha is finding herself increasingly believing, which causes John to be frustrated with her, and the predictable and repetitive scenes of marital tension follow. Marsha Mason pulls out all the acting stops in her many Oscar-speech scenes, but she's trying so hard that you're really just sitting there watching a woman act, rather than getting into her character. This reaches its zenith in a scene where she prays to God for forgiveness! Especially when she switches into Latin at the last minute! It's all supposed to be SO HARD-HITTING and it's too lame to manage even that. Let it also be noted that, for me at least, Marsha Mason pretty much sums up a certain kind of 70s banality; that kind of ostentatious \\"acting\\" passing as quality. Marsha Mason, ladies and gentlemen, MARSHA MASON.<br /><br />There follow several repetitive scenes in which Ivy has a nightmare, Anthony calms her down by calling her Audrey Rose, and John gets angry. Then enters a not-so-sub subtext in which Anthony and Marsha unite as the \\"real parents\\" of Ivy, and John is shuttled off to the side. This is announced quite unequivocally when Anthony says to Marsha \\"You and me made this child.\\" This occurs on a night when John had to work late, and places this movie among the spate of movies of the 70s/80s in which the husband is vilified for working [though we hear numerous comments about how lovely the family's Central Park West apartment is], and not \\"being there\\" for the family. Marsha accusingly says to John \\"he was here and you weren't!\\" Yes, how DARE you work to keep us in this nice apartment, and so I can pursue my amateur photography hobby! You callow cad! Typically [though it isn't pursued in this movie] any comments of the \\"well, who do you think puts this roof over your head?\\" variety are met with a rejoinder of how the wife would be perfectly happy to live in a henhouse, we're poor but we've got love, etc. Anyway, the second half of the movie is all about Marsha shutting her husband out, and him fighting to reclaim his stake in his family.<br /><br />Which brings us to the husband. He is played by John Beck, who sounded familiar, and I see that he was the 70s HUNK who played James Caan's sexy sexy sexy best friend in Rollerball. He, with his fluffy hair, mustache and blue eyes, is a classic 70s hunk in the Sam Elliott in Lifeguard mold. This movie also takes place during a time period when men always wore suits to work, and looked GREAT in the process. There was a LOT of fast-forwarding as I watched this movie, but I have to say there would have been a great deal more if I didn't have the alluring John to look at. Hey sweetie, if Marsha doesn't appreciate her nice digs, I'd be more than happy to take her place, and I can speculate with confidence that I give much better head.<br /><br />Anyway, it all drags toward a dull climax in which they decide to \\"prove\\" whether or not Ivy is really the reincarnation of Audrey Rose by hypnotizing her. And the viewer asks \\"well, how is this going to prove ANYTHING?\\" but this, as per usual, is not addressed by the movie. Little Ivy has the maturity to lament \\"I'm not sure who I am anymore... and I want to know! I've GOT to know!\\" Then the hypnotist provides the least convincing example of an \\"objective\\" party by telling Ivy \\"You are not Ivy, you are someone else.\\" Leading, anyone?<br /><br />SPOILERS>>><br /><br />Ivy is hypnotized, we get non-convincing evidence that she IS the reincarnation, etc., and she dies. This leads Anthony to repeat \\"It's all right now.\\" And I wanted John and/or Marsha to say \\"Uh, exactly how is this all right? Our daughter is dead, and she probably wouldn't have been if you had never come into our lives.\\" This is another thing the movie just assumes its audience will swallow, the accumulation of which really makes the viewer turn against the movie. &lt;&lt;&lt;END SPOILERS<br /><br />So there you have it. Kind of a waste of time, but for the eye-candy of the alluring John. Again, I think you could have a very interesting movie, or even remake, if we just took the perspective that Anthony IS nuts, and infiltrates and ultimately ruins this family. But what we have here... there is a better use for good plastic. And your time.ness! Especially when she switches into Latin at the last minute!

0767836286|2.0|This is one of those movies in which everything seems to be in place... and yet it still just falls flat.<br /><br />The acting is good, Bridges giving the strongest performance, though it's always a pleasure to see Joan Cusack in ANYTHING. The script is good, the direction is good... but the movie as a whole left me empty and a little irritated.<br /><br />It's unclear what this film would like to do, aside from entertain. Should we walk out feeling that terrorists are much more complex than they seem? Should we walk out feeling unsafe and suspecting everyone? There are scenes in this movie where Jeff Bridges is teaching a class in terrorism, and he talks about how illusory our feeling of safety is... and that's fine, but I wanted one of the students to ask \\"So what do you want us to do? Be afraid? Worry? Never leave the house? What?\\" In that way the movie seems to want to just stir up a lot of fear without giving it any direction or offering any possible solution. Of course there ISN'T a solution, but I feel that this movie stirs up a lot of fear and paranoia just to draw the audience into some excitement, and then makes the audience feel bad for being excited by such a thing. I felt manipulated and annoyed after it ended.<br /><br />I also think this entire subject is a little too sensitive to be trying to milk entertainment dollars out of. If you want to make a serious drama, go ahead, but don't try to both draw us in with the promise of \\"spooky terrorist thrills\\" and then want to have a serious look at the issue. I was also a little bit uncomfortable with the sheer number of children-in-extreme-peril scenes. Again, if you want to treat this subject seriously, go ahead, but don't invite us to be \\"thrilled\\" by it.<br /><br />I will say that the cinematography [by Bobby Bukowski] in this film was amazing. It makes SUCH a difference simply to have some visually interesting compositions up on the screen for once, instead of having movies that have all the compositional thought of snapshots. It just gives you something to LOOK at. My favorite scenes were the one with the RED phones against the grey sky, and the fence with the grey roofs above it. Amazing! Kudos to you, guys! This was literally my favorite part of the movie.<br /><br />As for the \\"surprise\\" ending-- Woo Hoo, Big Deal.<br /><br />I have come to like this movie less and less since I saw it [and that was pre-9/11]. This is one I would say you could skip completely, not even wait for the video. Just skip it. It leaves you with nothing but a bad taste in your mouth.mpositional thought of snapshots.

Mozart was NOT the 'goofball' depicted in this movie!  He had a sense of naughty humor (read his letters exchanged with a cousin, gathered and published in a book that I'm sure you'll find in the library).  But he knew how to behave himself and was not as irresponsible as the writers made him look (in order to 'prove' their point about jealousy).

B00004TH7Z|4.0|This album is not the best thing Maiden has ever done, but that's not easy. However, this makes a fine addition if you have 3 of their 80's albums at least. If you're new to Maiden, get Somewhere in Time, Powerslave, Piece of Mind, The Number of the Beast or Seventh Son first.    The Wicker Man starts this album off, and while it can suffer from chorus repetition, the WHOA bit at the end never tires you. This is followed by Ghost of the Navigator, which is one of the highlights and just a great song. It has a great chorus and doesn't suffer from the repetition that many other tracks on here suffer from. The title track is probably the best track on here, and I always enjoy it through to this day. Blood Brothers is a track I'm not so keen on, it plods along and also has quite weak vocals. The Mercenary is a galloper, sort of a cross between Wrathchild and The Trooper if that makes any sense.     Dream of Mirrors is a nine minute epic, quite soft (sort of like Blind Guardian), even though it doesn't sound like BG at all. It can get rather repetitive though and I'd call it average. Unfortunately, The Fallen Angel is the second weakest track on here. It's average and doesn't really do that much. It tries to be heavy, but lacks energy (for how this sort of song should sound, listen to Sea of Madness or The Mercenary). The Nomad is the second longest track, clocking in at 9:06 (15 seconds behind Dream of Mirrors). It has an eastern feel to it, with rough vocals. Its a great track really. Out of the Silent Planet is the weakest track on here, it suffers from repetition and I would have to give it 2/10. Its not a bad song but remember this is Maiden. They're capable of much better songs than this one.    The Thin Line between Love and Hate starts out like the Nomad, but its more progressive. Underrated IMO.    Standouts: Ghost of the Navigator, Brave New World, The Mercenary, The Nomad.

B00005JPQP|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />After the disastrous \\"Ocean's Twelve\\" was released in 2004, I ended my review by asking, \\"We've already had [this saga] sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?\\"  Well, at long last that question has been answered, and it has come in the form of a good news/bad news proposition.  The good news is that \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" marks at least a slight improvement over the previous installment (but then again that`s not a particularly high bar to jump over).  The bad news is that it is ONLY a slight improvement.<br /><br />For this latest entry in the series (which began, it is easy to forget, with the genuinely entertaining \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" in 2001), writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien, and director Steven Soderbergh have at least had the wisdom to return the boys back to Las Vegas, not having them traipsing all over Europe, as they did in the second installment, on what seemed like a high-cost junket for a bunch of already overpaid actors.  In \\"Thirteen,\\" Danny Ocean and his \\"crew\\" of con artist buddies rally behind the ailing Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), who has just been cheated out of his portion of a brand new casino by his unscrupulous partner, the allegorically named Willie Bank (Al Pacino), who wants the business all to himself.  The plan is to sabotage Bank's place so it will go belly-up even before it officially opens.<br /><br />At the beginning, \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" seems like it might turn out to be a fairly decent caper movie, but after about the first half hour or so, a noticeable fatigue and lethargy begin to creep into both the writing and the performances.  Very quickly, the plot runs out of steam and we come to sense that the all-star players - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner et. al.- are merely going through the motions, hanging around just long enough to cash their hefty paychecks before heading off to worthier, more artistically rewarding endeavors.  Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Cheadle, in particular, have been striking out on such interesting career paths of late, that, perhaps, their hearts just aren't in this saga much anymore.  And without their acting like it matters, it makes it hard for us in the audience to feel that any of it matters either.<br /><br />\\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" may be better than \\"Ocean's Twelve,\\" but it's still a largely half-hearted effort that does little to burnish the reputation of the original movie.  I think it's long past time to float this series out to sea so that its fine actors can continue pursuing more worthwhile projects.  We would all benefit from a win-win proposition like that.eavors.

And all of the shorts are directed by four different directors with decidedly four different styles that overlap one another via Ted the Bellhop (Tim Roth,(...) .<br /><br />It is Ted's first day on the job and it just so happens to be one of the busiest days of the year for the hotel (New Year's Eve). Relieving the old bellhop who'd worked there for fifty years, Ted is given sage advice that eventually falls apart on him (mostly related to sex, accountability, and keeping one's own council.)<br /><br />The first episode is entitled \\"The Missing Ingredient.\\" A clutch of witches inhabits a hotel room and they try to stir up incantations to revive a lost sexual sisters. Sammi Davis, Amanda De Cadenet, Valeria Golino, Ione Skye, Lili Taylor, Alicia Witt, and sex-pot Madonna round out the cast here. All of the witches brings a required item to the resurrection ceremony ...except one. She forgot to bring the sperm of a young man to add to their concoction. Enter Ted the Bellhop who finds his manliness much in need. This was the weakest of the four stories, failing to develop the tale or any of its characters, thus making the entire thing fall flat on its cinematic butt (even though there were plenty of nice butts and boobs in it). (...) director Allison Anders misses his mark.<br /><br />The next episode is \\"The Wrong Man.\\" Sigfried (David Proval) and his wife Angela (Jennifer Beals) are having an interesting New Year's Eve playing a rather kinky game of tie-up-the-wife- and-see-what-happens. Ted is brought into their midst and the sparks start to fizzle. Is Sigfried gay? Is Angela psychotic? Funny thanks to David Proval's history as a film bad-guy, this one had potential thanks to director Alexandre Rockwell.<br /><br />The third installment is \\"The Misbehavers.\\" A husband and wife played by Antonio Banderas (...) and Tamlyn Tomita plan to spend a romantic evening out but have to take their two misbehaving kids with them.

B00005JPKE|3.0|In my review of [[ASIN:B000M4RG42 Flags of Our Fathers]], I mentioned that I wasn't sure if I'd be watching this flipside film based on the Japanese experience. My fears were twofold. First is that director Clint Eastwood lacks character development, and I was afraid he'd continue his trend with LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA. Second (and more recently noted within myself) is that I absolutely love [[ASIN:B000EHSVSC Tora! Tora! Tora!]] Similarities between it and the new Eastwood additions cannot be denied. Although Tora focused on the Pearl Harbor attack and not Iwo Jima, it did look at both sides of the war (Japan and America.) I feared that Dirty Harry might muddy the film-waters of Tora! Tora! Tora!<br /><br />Thankfully the latter didn't happen, but the former trend continues.<br /><br />With the exception of Ken Watanabe's ([[ASIN:B000EHRVMY Memoirs of a Geisha]]) portrayal of General Kuribayashi and Kazunari Ninomiya's Saigo, there were few characters with which the audience could identify. We care little for any of these doomed men simply because we don't know them well enough. The story itself is historically interesting, of course, and it's well told. But the lack of empathy viewers will have for any of the characters will likely plague this film to its bitter end.<br /><br />Where Tora! Tora! Tora! succeeded was not simply in its storytelling, but also in that we got in tight with everyone involved. From Martin Balsam's gruff Pacific Fleet Admiral to So Yamamura's demanding Vice-Admiral Yamamoto presence, all of the characters had some important measure within the film's scheme. Clint Eastwood seems to have had trouble doing this with two lengthy movies (Flags was 132 minutes long and Letters 141 minutes while Tora alone was just 144 minutes.)<br /><br />The thing I don't want to do here is disrespect (in any way) what happened on this little spit of land in the Pacific. The horrors were real and Mr. Eastwood does a fair job showing us some pretty abhorrent conditions the Japanese were subjected to. Clint Eastwood is a fine filmmaker, but he's not the finest. And this is also where I have a beef with the Oscar board members.<br /><br />This film is in a foreign language and yet it got nominated in the \\"Best Picture\\" category at last year's Oscars. I realize that the director is American, but that alone surely shouldn't dictate the category in which it's placed come awards time, should it? Almost all of the remaining awards ceremonies placed it in the \\"Foreign Language\\" category but not The Academy of Motion Picture Arts. A bit of cronyism going on? Banish the thought!ed to.

B000O1799U|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I didn't have very high expectations for this movie in the first place: any movie with Beyonce and an American Idol finalist is bound to be lousy, in my opinion. Don't let Jamiee Foxx fool you either; I think he is a great actor, but what can you expect of him when his fellow cast members and movie producers/writers are amateurs? <br /> <br />Honestly, the movie was lousy from the moment it started. I expected to get to get familiar with the characters and their situation before the plot began, but I was sadly mistaken. The first scene of the movie is a chaotic mess; there are some girls performing at a concert...some \\"diva\\" throws a fit for some reason...bla bla bla. Point is, within 5 minutes I was asking my girlfriend, \\"What the heck is going on??\\"  <br /> <br />I gave the movie another chance and kept watching, but it never recovered from the opening scene. Before I knew it, the Dream Girls were already rising to stardom when just a second ago they were begging for a spot at an amateur show. By the time they were signed to a record label and feuds and tensions were beginning to rise, I was still asking the same questions I asked at the beginning of the movie: Who are these girls? Why should I care about them? What is the big picture? <br /> <br />THE BOTTOM LINE: This movie utterly lack character development, which to me is the most important aspect of any movie/story. The acting was very sub-par, Beyonce was just plain tacky and the American Idol girl was clearly an amateur. Even Foxx was going through the motions and he clearly settled for mediocrity. The plot line was trite and played out: aspiring singers want to make it big; they sign with a record label; the record label tries to change things; the girls begin to feud; while they're feuding the take the world by storm; etc etc. The movie was so bad, I didn't even finish it, and let me add that I was watching it with my girlfriend and it had to be especially bad for her to allowme to hit the Stop button on the remote.  <br /> <br />I think that any rational person who is more accustomed to developed characters and cohesive plot lines will be bored with this movie in about 10 minutes. Men especially will dislike this movie. This movie's only fans are probably young girls who are used to tacky chick flicks and will enjoy this movie because it empowers women and all that nonsense. Let's all be real here, after \\"Ray\\" was a big hit, all the studios wanted to put out movies of the same genre (\\"Walk the Line,\\" \\"Dream Girls\\"), but clearly the wanna-bes aren't as good. <br /> <br />AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!

No longer restricted to the limits of the physical world, the war on terror has exploded onto the net. In an attempt to confront this new threat, an elite counter-terrorism and anti-crime unit was formed: Public Security Section 9.    Two years have passed since the team's commander, Major Motoko Kusanagi, resigned from her post. After a rash of mysterious suicides, Section 9 is forced to confront the Puppeteer, a dangerous hacker with unsurpassed skills.    As their investigation of this terrorist threat takes them deeper into the bowels of a potential government conspiracy, Section 9 once again crosses paths with the Major, but is her sudden reappearance more than a coincidence, or is she somehow connected to the Puppeteer?

This chapter originally came from--and appropriately--from Bradbury's short story  \\"Is Mars Heaven?\\"<br /><br />\\"It was a beautiful spring day. A robin sat on a blossoming apple tree A robin sat on a blossoming apple tree and sang continuously. Showers of petal snow sifted down when the wind touched the green  branches, and the blossom scent drifted upon the air. Somewhere in the town someone was playing the piano and the music came and went, came and want, softly, drowsily. The song was 'Beautiful Dreamer.'

Inside they could see a bead curtain hung across the hall entry, and a crystal chandelier and a Maxfield Parrish painting framed on one wall over a comfortable Morris chair.  The house smelled old, and of the attic, and infinitely comfortable.  You could hear the tinkle of ice in a lemonade pitcher.  In a distant kitchen, because of the heat of the day, someone was preparing a cold lunch.  Someone was humming under her breath, high and sweet....\\"<br /><br />Of course, everything is not as it appears.
0743454537|4.0|This was my first Picoult book, and it waa an absolute pleasure to read.  I often found myself questioning an ethical stand on which I [previously] thought I had a solid grip on!!  I found it interesting that Sara [the mother] was the individual on whom fell huge decisions.  I related to this all too well.  Why is it that MOM usually makes the tough calls & the rest of the family [DAD], usually, defer to her.  I didn't state that Mom makes the \\"right\\" calls -- just the huge ones.  I loved Picoult's characterizations, and she presents us with a wonderfully complex story.  Although the story is complex, the reading is smoothe -- it's easy to get lost in this book.  I think that the only time I put this book down was when I walked the dog!  Dinners were neglected and/or burned!!!  I believe that it will take me a long time, if ever, to truly decide what the correct decision regarding Anna vs. Kate would be.  This was one of the most thought provoking books I've read.  I'm still \\"flip-flopping\\" while Picoult resolved this issue in a most inventive manner.  I highly recommend this as a \\"must read\\" and can't wait to read the 2 more on the way.
B000GR8L1C|5.0|This is a interesting yet tough read. It was fascinating to see how Hitler saw the world, its problems and himself.  As he laid out the problems his insights were sometimes deep, lucid and fact-filled (though not always for he was a master of leaving out all the facts and twisting them to suit his needs) and then he would mention the word \\"Jew\\" and the rest of the chapter would be full of venom filled hatred with attacks, insinuations and claims that were way beyond reality!  Then he would close with his solutions to the items covered in the chapter and this was sometimes very in-depth, always interesting and sometimes put in general terms that you wonder if he knew what he was going to do, or if he was just hiding it from the masses at the time.  The chapters are long, so if you read this, give yourself time for each chapter.  Much of what Hitler decided to do when he was later in power are indeed covered in this book.  Some plans he did not follow, such as never fighting a two front war and his thoughts that Germany could be allied with England in the next war.  Mein Kampf is a fascinating look into the mind of Adolf Hitler.  But, be prepared, for while it is fascinating and a must read for those who wish to know more about Hitler it is a tough and at times tedious read because of his writing style and his rants about the Jewish, the Slavs and others he desired a \\"sub-humans\\".  If you want a glimpse into the mind of this insane, power hungry, ruthless dictator then read this book.  But, give yourself time!
0446528056|2.0|The only thing I really liked about this book was the father of the main character. He was quirky and different and throughout the book you begin to understand why. The rest of it reminded me of a Soap on television.  I would recommend this read to anyone who wanted to kill time on a plane ride or just needed something easy to read that would not make you think. Otherwise read the paper.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|It is sad to say but Linkin Park had taken a huge step backward with this one. So much so, that it was a stretch for me to give it 2 stars. The uninspiring melodies, political themes, and multiple f-bombs are not what I expected from the band that I had considered as musical genius' after their first two offerings. Hybrid Theory and Meteora are still tops on my list of great albums, but Minutes to Midnight is painfully forgettable.
1400063515|5.0|Now that I'm finished reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's latest classic, The Black Swan, I need to take a few days off to let my brain decompress.  Taleb is brilliant and his writing style helps the reader look at trends, markets and information in general in a completely new manner.  I read Taleb's previous book, Fooled by Randomness, earlier and there are plenty of correlations between it and The Black Swan; you don't need to read Fooled by Randomness first, but it provides a good foundation for what you'll find in The Black Swan.<br /><br />What's so special about Taleb and his books?  He's a master storyteller and seems to have an excellent example for every point he's trying to make.  Most authors couldn't pull off the cynical and oftentimes sarcastic approach he takes; I find it one of the most entertaining and engaging aspects of his work.  I love the way he's able to pinpoint the poor logic that we're all guilty of at one time or another and how we often hear only what we want to hear.  For example, he notes how when a doctor says \\"there is no evidence of cancer\\" we often misinterpret that as \\"there is evidence of no cancer\\"; obviously there's a huge difference between the two, but the latter is impossible to state with 100% certainty.<br /><br />Think about this excerpt the next time you ask your investment specialist for advice:<br /><br />\\"Our inability to predict in environments subjected to the Black Swan, coupled with a general lack of the awareness of this state of affairs, means that certain professionals, while believing they are experts, are in fact not.  Based on their empirical record, they do not know more about their subject matter than the general population, but they are much better at narrating -- or, worse, at smoking you with complicated mathematical models.  They are also more likely to wear a tie.\\"<br /><br />In that one paragraph you get a great feel for the biting commentary Taleb provides throughout this excellent book.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|I'm very impressed with this package overall. We purchased the discs, sight unseen, and find them to be quite remarkable with regards to the scope and content, as everyone has already pointed out before. There is some repetitive footage spanning the 5 discs, but it's not too annoying.<br /><br />The reason I am giving this disc 4 stars instead of 5 is primarily due to the audio. The narration, by Ben Kingsley, is so low in the mix that it is nearly impossible to hear what he is saying when accompanied by the orchestral soundtrack. My wife and I have to watch this with subtitles on. Only after major adjustments on my surround sound set-up, I was able to bring in the vocals to normal levels. Without surround sound in place, it was really hard for us to hear the narration.
B00000DF6O|5.0|I've always liked B.B. King's music ever since I was a kid when I'd catch him on TV periodically. He just seemed genuine in his playing and the style and sound was something that appealed to me personally. So I started to collect some of  his music in the late 70's after I got out of college.<br /><br />Then I had the privilege of seeing him perform \\"live\\" twice in the mid 90's while I lived in Spokane, WA. His love of the music and his joy in bringing it to you was palpable. The thrill was definitely not gone for Riley B. King.<br /><br />So I started to revisit his catalog and I came across Blues On The Bayou. The reviews were sterling across the board, but what attracted me to this particular disc out of all 15 or so that I have was that he used his ROAD BAND in the studio. For many artists, this is not standard practice. They use producer chosen studio folks for their recording sessions. This is one reason that mainstream music coming out of Nashville has that \\"sameness\\" to it - it's all the same guys playing in different configurations behind a variety of artists. The music might as well come off the end of a conveyor belt coming out of a factory for all the originality it displays.<br /><br />Well, not in this case. First thing they did here was use a little recording studio somewhat off the beaten track. This is good strategy because it eliminates the distractions over the course of the days given over to recording. There's just pretty much you and the music and so you can get deeper into it as you attempt to find the best sounds in recording it. In the case of this disc, it paid off in spades.<br /><br />The choice of songs fits the title and the musicianship is top notch across the board. If you like lively, smooth sounding blues, you can't go wrong here. Sample the various tunes and I dare you to tell me I'm wrong....
0823023494|5.0|Tom Bancroft's \\"Creating Characters with Personality\\" provides a solid foundation for folks who are interested in creating and developing characters for sequential arts and animation. All the basics are explored here, with copious examples: simple shapes, line of action, appeal, etc.<br /><br />One thing that sets this book apart from the rest is how several examples of the process of character design are shown. The book reiterates several times that the first design isn't always the best - that one should continue to explore other design possibilities before settling on the final look and feel of a character. If you are interested in refining or creating your own character, I would recommend purchasing this book along with Ben Caldwell's Action! Cartooning and Fantasy Cartooning.<br /><br />While beginners can certainly appreciate this book, I think it's best suited for intermediate level artists who are looking to refine their technique. Highly recommended.

0887307280|3.0|Entrepreneurs and people thinking about becoming entrepreneurs ought to read this book to gain perspective, not to find a magic bullet solution.  Gerber thinks all small businesses should operate with a franchise mentality; that is, basing the business on repeatable, profitable systems rather than on the personality of the owner.<br /><br />This is fine as far as it goes, but when Gerber puts all these elements of process (strategy, management, hr, marketing, sales, etc.) into a series of one-size-fits-all formulas, I think he is overreaching. Depending on a company's product/service, personnel, market, and a slew of other factors, these formulas may need quite an overhaul to fit the company's needs.  That said, the book is loaded with words of wisdom.  A few examples--<br /><br />\\"Adolescence begins at the point in the life of your business when you decide to get some help.\\"<br /><br />\\"To The Entrepreneur, the business is the product.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is literally impossible to produce a consistent result in a business that depends on extraordinary people.  No business can do it for long.  And no extraordinary business tries to!\\"<br /><br />\\"Most companies organize around personalities rather than functions.\\"<br /><br />Some readers may discover a great deal about themselves as they read. Gerber says entrepreneurs have three mentalities--the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.  These mentalities are always in conflict, and the way in which the owner balances them determines the success or failure of the business.  If E-Myth helps owners figure out how to achieve a better balance, that insight will go further towards building the business than all Gerber's systems put together.

1596912855|3.0|Shannon Hale is best known for The Princess Academy and other children's tales.  This is her first adult book. <br /> <br />Jane Hayes is a seemingly normal young New Yorker with a hidden obsession.  She's crazy about Mr. Darcy, as played by Colin Firth in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  Problem is this is ruining her life.  No real man can compare. <br /> <br />When a wealthy relative wills her a trip to an English resort catering to Austen-crazed women, Jane's fantasies come true. <br /> <br />It's all a game but the longer she stays, the more her insecurities seem to vanish.  Will she finally kick her Austen obsession for good or will her dreams actually result in a Mr. Darcy of her own? <br /> <br />This is the perfect book to take to the beach.  A fun roam through the world of Jane Austen.  Shannon Hale does a great job of bringing this world to life with the perfect Regency-era gentlemen, empire-waist gowns, no modern appliances, and the stiff British conversations. <br /> <br />I especially loved the references to Jane's former boyfriends that are woven throughout the story.  The only problem I had was with the ending.  I thought it was a little bit too predictable.

0743298020|3.0|THE THIRTEENTH TALE is an ambitious first novel by Diane Setterfield.  It comprises a pair of interwoven tales ostensibly about the special relationship between twins, and further poses the question as to the true nature of a person's complete or whole identity.  The gothic twin tales, if you will, are set about a hundred to sixty years apart, in England.  The more-or-less contemporary tale (the actual era is left vague, it could be anytime in the last fifty years), about a young, bookish woman, Margaret, who keeps a secret past, is a ghost story of sorts; far more creepy and diabolical is the older tale, with its themes of incest, sadomasochism, violence, and alienation.<br /><br />The novel aims also to be a mystery, with Margaret trying to crack the puzzle of a famous writer's past.  It's the mystery plot that keeps the momentum of the story moving.  The astute reader might figure out key parts of the mystery on the way, and will find that the resolution of other pieces of the mystery are only suggested and not necessarily spelled out.  One also has to be willing to suspend one's disbelief a few more times than one would like.  It's unfortunate, in a way, because the characters aren't so well fleshed out or even so very appealing that one feels much empathy for them.  Since you don't care much about them then, you want the mystery, at least, to be stronger to make up for it.<br /><br />It's not clear what Setterfield is trying to do with this novel.  We don't really get insight into the nature of the special relationship between twins (at least, not beyond what one might discover in popular psychology); it almost seems the idea of twins is just the McGuffin to drive the plot.  (Indeed, it would be interesting to see what Hitchcock would have done with the story; in any case, it seems ready-made for the screen.)  At times, it comes off as a tad pretentious, what with the repeated references to JANE EYRE and the recurrent images, laden with portentous significance (I think), such as the tapping of rain on the windows.  The overall mood is heavy and sad; sparing and deftly used humor, actually, might have helped the story.  The creepy relationship between the brother and sister in the older tale has moments that verge on Tarantino-style humor, but if it was her intent to be ghoulishly funny, it didn't really work for me.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this novel despite its many shortcomings.  The twin tales, albeit bizarre and disturbing, are nonetheless compelling.  The writing style is a step up from your supermarket pulp fiction.  There is some promise in this new novelist, and one hopes to see better work in her next outing.nce (I think), such as the tapping of rain on the windows.

0316018953|4.0|Michael Connelly's \\"The Overlook\\" brings back veteran homicide detective and confirmed cynic, Harry Bosch, who is now working out of Homicide Special.  Harry's supervisor calls him at midnight and instructs him to drive out to the overlook above the Mulholland Dam in Los Angeles.  There lies the body of forty-two year old Dr. Stanley Kent, a medical physicist who handles nuclear material used in the treatment of cancer.<br /><br />Before long, the feds are in the picture, trying to take over.  Among them is Harry's former lover, Special Agent Rachel Walling, of a shadowy FBI unit known as Tactical Intelligence.  The federal authorities believe that the killers may be terrorists who stole cesium pellets that had been in Kent's possession.  This radioactive substance would be deadly if it were placed in an improvised explosive device and detonated in a populated area.<br /><br />Harry is in an awkward position.  Although he was assigned to investigate Kent's homicide, Rachel and her partner are shutting him out.  Bosch fears that he may end up a spectator rather than a participant in his case, and he is determined to do whatever it takes to solve the murder his way.  Assisting Harry is his new partner, Ignacio Ferras, who is more than twenty years younger and a straight arrow.  Ignacio is uneasy with the older man's freewheeling style, his irreverence, and his tendency to ignore orders when it suits him.<br /><br />\\"The Overlook\\" was originally a sixteen-part serial that was published in the New York Times Magazine, and this relatively brief novel has a sketchy quality.  Connelly's novels are usually more complex, with multi-layered plots, sharply delineated characters, and even a bit of philosophy thrown in.  This is a standard police procedural that feels a bit formulaic, with its done-to-death themes of warring law enforcement agencies, bureaucratic ineptitude, and a possible terrorism angle.<br /><br />However, Michael Connelly still scores with \\"The Overlook\\" because Harry Bosch is so intelligent and relentless in his pursuit of the truth.  The veteran detective uses his superb powers of observation, his knowledge of human nature, and his decades of experience to see connections that everyone else has missed.  Harry manages to turn the entire investigation on its ear, and once again he redeems himself just when it appears that he has burned all his bridges behind him.  Harry is a keeper, one of the good guys, a pessimist who feels the pull of the darkness but, as he tells himself, \\"the important thing is to fight it.\\"  As long as Harry is out there doing what he does best, his fans will be following along with him.verlook\\" because Harry Bosch is so intelligent and relentless in his pursuit of the truth.

B000W1V5VU|4.0|Danny Ocean and his Eleven are back in Las Vegas This time, Danny tries to talk sense into Willie Bank, the owner of a series of highly rated \\"5 Diamonds\\" hotels who double-crossed one of Eleven, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), on a hotel deal causing the man a heart-attack and coma-like state. After the ruthless and arrogant Bank suggests that Reuben \\"rolls over and dies\\", Danny and his team decide to take the Bank's stunning new casino out of business on the big opening night. The third Ocean's movie is great fun and a wonderful mixture of genres that works as comedy/crime/thriller/revenge. Vegas is spectacular. The jokes are funny, the dialogs are witty, the directing is first class with the split screens, unusual angles, and the camera that always moves fast but does not rush. The acting is terrific. The absence of Julia Roberts and Katherine Zeta Jones is more than compensated by the presence of great Ellen Barkin who is a better actress than two and a hot beautiful woman, the real \\"cougar\\". Besides Ocean and his Eleven (who all have fun with their parts but this time Carl Reiner was simply outstanding), it was great to see David Paymer as an unlucky (or was he?) hotel reviewer and Eddie Izzard as a famous computer hacker. Did I mention that Al Pacino took the role of Willie Bank and he was excellent playing in his quiet mode without screaming which I like a lot? There are certainly the holes in the story and the absence of logic but I did not care a bit. \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is not about logic or plausibility or realism, it is all about fun and entertaining and it entertains admirably. It is a very successful and enjoyable sequel in the series of Ocean's movies and we all know that good sequels don't happen too often.

Not to mention the lyrics and melodies are getting realy stale.  I agree with some of the other poster's in that they have just spread themselves way to thin. I think they need a break as well.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|Ah, if we could all travel through time and prevent tragedies and find true love...  Here we see an in-credible movie where Keanu Reeves (Alex Wyler) and Sandra Bullock (Dr. Kate Forster) play a nearly star-crossed couple. I got confused with the plot, Alex's father (Christopher Plummer) designed the house but Alex purchased it? A glass house on stilts over a lake I could never live in. Stranger is Alex reading notes from Kate, a previous tenant from the future. It was all mind-boggling and I was waiting for a secret portal to appear where they could meet sooner and she could save Alex. The movie got tedious and was too predictable. Still, it was nice seeing Bullock and Reeves pair up again. Their down to earth acting added to their incredible chemistry, make this movie a pleasure to watch. A surreal and romantic, time-travel romance-- It's nice sometimes to dream, isn't it?
B00004RF9I|5.0|NETWORK, a brilliant film directed by Sidney Lumet, takes a bold and darkly humorous look at the world of network television in the United States.  We are introduced to Howard Beale (played by the late, great Peter Finch), an anchorman who is getting the axe for low ratings.  Beale announces on the air that he plans to \\"blow his brains out.\\"  Of course, this gets his network and those surrounding forces talking.  This lunatic deserves a proper opportunity to say good-bye to his viewership (though, increasingly sparce).  Little do they know that what they intended as an opening for him to say good-bye will blossom into a far-different situation.  His on air rave generates a great audience, because this man wants to tell \\"the truth\\" about the world (politically, socially) and those in the quiet and comfort of their homes want to hear what he has to say. The film also stars Faye Dunaway as a stealthy network spin doctor, William Holden and Robert Duvall.<br /><br />Of course, the famous line that was extracted from one of Beale's on-air raves and spiraled into one of the most-quoted (and mis-quoted) lines from a film is, \\"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\\"  This quote was used as recently as this past week, when co-star Isaiah Washington was fired from the popular series, GREY'S ANATOMY. It has also been used in many different instances to convey defiance.  NETWORK is a brilliant and timely film that reflects the state of our world and how television plays into our daily lives; what's more, how the plight of one man (no matter how mad) can potentially become great fodder for the media if it sells.  This could be reflected on today, when we think about those occupying a space in the media (and in Associated Press columns), in the face of a major war and many other disturbing plights.  What sells?  Ultimately, corruption does.  Does it matter how the corruption effects the subject of its darkness?  No, just as long as it brings in money, either through viewership or printed publication.  The AFI calls NETWORK, released in 1976,  one of the greatest American films of all time.  I would agree, because it is a masterpiece, with brilliant acting.  What's more, Peter Finch received a well-earned posthumous Academy Award, for Best Actor, for this his amazing performance.

The deep sadness of \\"Little Green,\\" \\"Blue,\\" and \\"River\\" is perfectly balanced with the warm exuberance of \\"All I Want\\" and \\"Carey.\\"  You can't just take out one song; you have to experience the album as a whole.  I heard this album in college when a (good) friend introduced me to Joni, and I remember thinking how I could feel ever song \\"like it was written in my soul\\" (see Bob Dylan's \\"Tangled Up In Blue,\\" his tribute to Joni's album, on [[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks]]).  What has always struck me about this Blue is that here Joni Mitchell was obviously digging so deep into her own life, her own experiences and introspection, and yet she creates something that is so universal.  If you don't like introspective, singer-songwriter, folk music, you may not like this, but if you give it a try, I think you'll end up tangled up in Blue too!

0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist -Paulo Coelho 167 pgs.     Coelho's classic tale ranks as one of the best travel books of all time.  As with any other great travel story the voyage is not simply a physical one but a personal and spiritual one as well.  The book follows the wanderings of the young Spaniard Santiago.  Struck by the desire to see the world at a young age, Santiago leaves his family to take up the roaming life of a shepherd.  After exploring the rolling hills and pastures of southern Spain for two years a series of strange events lead Santiago to sell his flock and set out in quest of his own personal legend.  The resulting journey is a classic description of one persons attempt to find the meaning of his life.      Coelho's writing is heavily influenced by his own personal understanding of religion and spirituality.  Often such authors find a narrower audience for their work because of this, but this is not the case with Coelho.  His words take on a sense of universalism that seems to transcend any one set of beliefs.  This is due to the mystical quality that permeates his writings and thoughts, the belief that the world and everything in it and outside of it share connections that at first glance are hard to discern.       His words are also very personal in nature and one often has the impression that Coelho's characters share something with oneself.  To be able to write about something that everyone already knows but to present it in a new form is the key to being a great writer and this is what Coelho does so well.  He taps into some general truths or human universals that everyone can relate to, something that one has felt but not known how to organize in any systematic fashion.  In this way his stories are not only about the characters contained on the pages, but also about the reader who is holding the book.    It is not the most profound book you will ever read but it will make you take a step back and view your life a bit differently.  Sometimes the most important things are the simplest ones.
0618871713|5.0|This is probably the best memoir I've ever read. [[ASIN:0143035746 The Liars' Club: A Memoir]] is an amazing book, but this one has more charms, a more clear-headed desire to cut through the upper layers and get to the meat of the thing. The book is a graphic novel, and that allows Bechdel to do all sorts of tricks with the memoir form that wouldn't otherwise be possible - constant reveals of information in interesting ways, more implication than explication, and recreation of scenes through images rather than the written word. This also makes it a quick read, if a very compelling one. I have a suspicion it's one I'll want to read over and over, too. Pick up a copy of your own.
0156027321|4.0|<br />The Life of Pi first and foremost was a quick read, it took me about 2 days.  This is a surefire sign of at least an engaging book, one that draws the reader into it and almost forces them to keep reading.  Secondly the topic of the book dealt with, mainly religious synthesis, reason, and ever-changing conceptions of thought systems employed throughout time, is an extremely interesting topic to me.  The study of religion has always been intriguing, if not for the insight it provides into so many contemporary issues today then it is for the rich history that comes hand in hand with almost all religions.  Mantel makes the case that reason should be included in the category of religion, for although it has no godhead at its apex, it is an attempt to explain life and the world around us in absolute terms, something that unfortunately has continually escaped human grasp.  Armed with the thought system of reason to explain the world around them, rationalists are necessarily putting their faith in reason as the means to explain everything, which it does not.  In this view reason is just a substitute for religion in answering the questions that humans have pondered over for thousands of years.   <br /> <br />The story is an intriguing one.  Pi Pental has grown up around animals, water, and religion all his life.  His father is a zookeeper in a part of southern India that used to be a French colony.  His whole family has been involved with zoo and the upkeep of the animals as long as he can remember.  A friend of the family, a former champion swimmer, has taught Pi to swim, something Pi takes to with pride as no one else in his family can do.  From a few early chance encounters with Christianity and Islam, Pi becomes incredibly interested and invested in the religions, as well as his own native Hinduism.   <br /> <br />All seems to be going well for Pi in life when his parents decide they have had enough of the life and government in India.  Pi and his brother are informed that the decision has been made to move with all the animals to Canada where zoos are more appreciated and life holds more opportunities.  The family makes their preparations to leave and sets off on the voyage that will change Pi's life forever.  Somewhere in the middle of the Pacific the cargo ship Pi and his family are riding on with the animals sinks in a storm leaving Pi stranded on a lifeboat together with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger.  It is at this point the struggle between faith and reason emerges.  The allegorical potential is certainly abounds in such a situation with such a topic, but as with any good allegory the surface story is entertaining in its own right. <br /> <br />So, does Mantle believe in the supremacy of reason over religion?  Well the main character of his book is an adherent of three different and seemingly conflicting faiths, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity.  The fact that Pi draws on his faith continually throughout his many ordeals and uses it to overcome situations at which reason balks says a lot about what Mantel thinks.  I don't think abandoning reason is ever suggested, simply the point that reason is a good and useful tool for understanding the world, but that it can only take one so far.   <br /> <br />The book is definitely worth the read and provokes some interesting thoughts.  On top of that it is a pretty good story to boot.  The only knock I can give it is that the plot is reminiscent of a similar story involving a lone soul on a boat in the middle of the ocean tackling spiritual questions.  Did you guess it?  The Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway.  I would say there is a pretty good chance that Mantel has read this book once or twice before coming up with his own story.  The footsteps of Hemingway aren't bad ones to be following in though. <br />

0743455967|5.0|I was a bit skeptical before buying Stephen's book \\"On Writing\\" as personal and gifted talent doesn't always transfer to the classroom but I was happily mistaken. Stephen's easy style allowed me to learn more and understand a greater command of the basics. Solid skills, solid advice. He reminds you not to take yourself too seriously and know where you are at all times with your work.
055358202X|2.0|Splitting the book didn't work for me.  The characters included in AFFC are the least interesting imho.  Cersei, Brienne, Sam (from the wall), Asha (the iron folk) and Arya and Sansa are the only stories.  Of these, I found only Brienne and the iron folk stories to be mildly compelling.  The other stories seem to serve no other purpose than to provide back drop of the events going on in the land.  The Arya and Sansa stories were exercies in tedium.  Overall, I was amazed at how little the over all plot was progressed after AFFC.  The majority (75%) of AFFC should have been cut and combined with the missing characters into a single book.  GRR Martin has added so many characters that the story has now become unwieldly.  Honestly, I can't keep track of all the characters, names, histories, alliances and cultural idiosyncracies.  I loved the first three books, but GRR Martin has lost focus in AFFC. <br /> <br />I recommend that you wait and see if GRR Martin can pull the story back to together in the next book prior to investing time/money in AFFC.
0743243153|5.0|Like many who may be inclined to purchase a book on leading a productive, engaged , spiritually rewarding life written by a psychiatrist, I have studied more than my share of psychology over the years.  What Scott Peck, M.D., does however, is take the many different pieces that I knew at some level and puts them in a most readable and utile manner.  This is not touchy-feely, free love, take what you want, feel good psychology but the real deal calling for real discipline, thoughtfulness, separation, and commitment -- that is if one wants to lead a sane life life of self growth and do his/her part for the spiritual growth of a partner and/or children. <br /> <br />Emerson defined genius as the expression of previously unsaid but seemingly common knowledge.  The Road Less Travelled largely breaks no  new ground but by taking many disparate strains from psychology, psychiatry, theology, and his own life long observations, his books falls well within Emerson's definitions of genius.   <br /> <br />I clearly wish I had read it sooner; the clarity provided (the emphasis on discipline and delayed gratification for example) could have helped me get to the less travelled road of rewarding self fullfillment much sooner than my jumbled attempts at same.   However, one needs to be in a frame of mind to appreciate the prescriptions of Dr Peck. That requires a receptivity to thinking hard about the well trod but perhaps very self destructive path to which one may be deeply committed .  One must be ready to dare to change a course that does not work and commit to both a plan of action and other people in a way that one had not truly considered.  Could I have done that without the weight of my own experience revealing the inadequacies of my older approach?  <br /> <br /> If a reader is in a frame of mind to take a hard look at his/her own life and listen to some challenging prescriptions well reasoned and well presented, then this is a hell of a book-- maybe even a personally tranformative one.
0743289684|5.0|\\"Infidel\\" by Ayaan Hirsi Ali is among the best books I have read in the last 5 years.  Her story is disturbing, yet beautiful.  Her vocabulary is simple, yet elegant.  The way she describes her soul's inner battle between a religion that was forced upon her, and that this religion was not right for her, make the reader live both her struggles and her accomplishments as if it was his/her own.  A must read for a person who wishes to understand the root of the ideologic battle between the \\"Middle East\\" and the \\"Western World\\".
B000JJRIN4|2.0|I can't even stand the hit songs from the CD wind it up, and sweet escape. I think Stefani's new album shows very little growth from her first solo album. I liked her first album, while very narcissistic I liked most of the songs.  <br />The best song on this album is 4am which is a GREAT song! I really liked it. Other than that there are a few 80's dance sounding songs on here that I like, similiar to her first album. Otherwise, it's a futilie attempt to attract 14 year olds, and lacks any depth or growth. I think you can be funky, and offbeat without lowering yourself to a musical lackey. I wish there were more funky, groovy songs like 4am. Definitely not worth buying the album. I love Gwen, and wish she would try a little harder to show us her talent.
0316018953|3.0|Harry is back, but don't get too excited as the book is so short it will be over almost as fast as the blot. For a huge Michael Connelly fan I was very disappointed. This struck me as something to satisfy the publisher, not the readers.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|I love this movie! First of all I adore Hugh Grant, and his wit hits a homerun in this movie. But, I am a huger Zellweger and Firth fan as well.  <br />Who does not love the way Bridget seems to always mock, and humiliate herself, yet win people over in an instant. She's a true underdog, but a loveable character looking for love...and bullocks....trouble, and moritifying moments always seem to find her. I can watch this movie any day of the week and laugh. Plus, it has a great soundtrack.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this as a Mother's Day Gift for my mom. It is a Video inspiring series. I was disappointed that it was not Sigorney Weaver as in the series on Tv.

B00005JPD0|5.0|This movie put me in the mind ( A LITTLE) of \\"12 Monkeys\\". But the difference is that 12 Monkeys was about time travel alone. \\"Deja Vu\\" concentrates more on video surveilance by the government to go back in time, but ultimately, it too concerns actual time travel.<br /><br />The story goes like this:<br /><br />A ferry in New Orleans blows up one morning with over 500 people aboard. A lot of them are sailors, thier wives and children.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is a detective investigating the case, when the Government picks him to bring him into a new system they have, and the system is this:<br /><br />Basically it is \\"Big Brother\\"-<br /><br />for miles thre is satellite video equipment in space, circling this certain area and capturing EVERYTHING within so many miles. It can actually go right through houses and walls.<br /><br />They (police (Denzel), and the FBI) are stationed at tables in front of big screen TV's and can literally go ANYwhere within the crime area- up to 4 days in the past.<br /><br />They are able to go back and try to find the person responsible for the blast if they do it in the next few days, that is .. AND they need to have some idea of where to begin to look.<br /><br />That is where Denzel comes in, he focuses in on a certain young woman and they begin to track her last days, which ultimately leads them to thier killer.<br /><br />It goes a LOT deeper than this too, actually. Because while tracking this girl, Denzel discovers there is a certain magnetic field in time and space which causes a \\"time warp\\" type of thing where he can pass a note through (to himself) 4 days in the past, warning of the disaster, hence, preventing all the deaths.<br /><br />Of course, although it has not been tested, Denzel himself goes through to apprehend the killer, which makes for some great chase scenes.<br /><br />This movie has got to be one of the best I have seen in a long time.<br /><br /> I recommend it to anyone who likes a movie with a lot of action, and one that takes a lot of thinking. I also LOVE movies concerning time travel, which this also has.<br /><br />I guarantee you will not be dissapointed!ne that takes a lot of thinking. I also LOVE movies concerning time travel, which this also has. <br />I guarantee you will not be dissapointed!

The season will not begin until '08 - this MUST be diagnosed and examined - and releasing it on the 11th of December before the holidays is another American Holiday rip off.  Fans will purchase this on the day of release.  It must be studied to enjoy and become enraptured with the new season.  Get real studio heads;  this is a BIG gap between seasons - you will lose viewers.  Get with it and release it early enough since we do not get an autumn easter egg.  PLEASE!

The beautiful score by Phillip Glass and the stylistic cinematography took me back to the great horror films of the 1930's (though this should not be thought of as a horror film but a good mystery!) This one kept me guessing to the end. One of the best for me in the last year.

1400063515|4.0|While reading Taleb's \\"The Black Swan,\\" I cannot be as excited as many of those who see this as a breath of fresh air, as a new way of looking at things. The central point being made by Taleb is quite on target; there are unpredictable events that can occur that simply cannot be anticipated or predicted. We are too often overconfident in our ability to predict and try to shape the future.  But I do have questions about his book.  First, his thesis is hardly novel.  Robert Nisbet (a social scientist, a species of being beneath contempt in Taleb's universe) said essentially the same thing over thirty years ago (Quoting from his \\"The Year 2000 and All That\\"):<br /><br />\\"It is very different with studies of change in human society.  Here the Random Event, the Maniac, the Prophet, and the Genius have to be reckoned with.  We have absolutely no way of escaping them.  The future-predictors don't suggest that we can avoid them or escape them. . . .  What the future-predictors. . .say in effect is that with the aid of institute resources, computers, linear programming, etc., they will deal with the kinds of change that are not the consequences of the Random Event, the Genius, the Maniac, and the Prophet [which sound like black swans to this reader].  To which I can only say: there really aren't any; not any worth looking at anyhow.\\"<br /><br />That's the basic point of Taleb's book, so he's not exactly breaking new ground. Taleb says on page xxvii that he's sticking \\"my neck out\\" to claim that \\"our world is dominated by the extreme, the unknown, and the very improbable. . . .\\"  What sticking out his neck?  A well regarded academic said much the same thing thirty years ago and, to the best of my knowledge, Nisbet wasn't perceived as \\"sticking his neck out\\" or punished for his apostasy.<br /><br />Second, his presentation misses the point on a number of matters.  He mentions the punctuated equilibrium approach to evolutionary change.  This view contends that there is stasis over long periods of time and then a quick burst of evolutionary change.  Taleb focuses, in this book, on such punctuational events.  However, most of the time, there is stasis.  We cannot simply ignore what is normal over long periods of time and only focus on those rare black swans that transform things.  Take elections.  For a period of time, there is predictability in electoral and party dynamics.  Then, every so often, for reasons that can't be predicted beforehand [a black swan event], the electoral and party system changes in a relatively short period of time.  Does that mean we should ignore \\"ordinary politics\\" associated with \\"calm political periods\\"?  No, that's absurd--but that's also Taleb's argument.  We should ignore \\"central tendency\\" (in statistical terms) and only consider outliers (extraordinary events)?  That doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />He also cites people who actually undermine some of his arguments.  Kahneman's work on cognitive biases is very important and supports well the book's argument.  But Taleb cites (but does not discuss in detail) Gigerenzer, who argues that heuristics and cognitive biases, as a result of evolution, are very accurate, contrary to Kahneman's work.  Since Taleb cites Gigerenzer, he ought to note that the latter's view of cognition moves in a different direction, in opposition to the book's thesis.  In contradiction to Taleb's discussion on pages 81-82, Gigerenzer argues that intuition is at least as valid and accurate as the cognitive, thinking system.<br /><br />Third, as a number of reviewers note, there's a lot of anger in this book.  Sarcasm and venom directed at entire professions based on an isolated anecdote here or there seem to run against the author's own arguments about how we ought to make decisions.  In Kahneman's terms, Taleb falls prey to the \\"representativeness heuristic\\" [overgeneralizing from small sample sizes], falls prey to the \\"availability heuristic\\" [using whatever vivid examples come quickly to mind, such as the dopey political scientist wed to game theory--as if this justifies dismissing the entire discipline from one example], and he obviously falls prey to \\"confirmation bias\\" since he does not challenge his own thesis and try to falsify it but focuses instead on providing evidence to support his perspective [RIP his devotion to Karl Popper].  His snide dismissal of thinkers like Wittgenstein tends to be theater with little substance.  If you want to trash someone, provide some reason and logic for doing so.  And while I agree with many of Taleb's criticisms of thinkers and systems of thought, I am unimpressed with his snide put downs that don't advance understanding.<br /><br />Fourth, he tends to set up \\"straw men\\" and then demolish these.  For instance, he criticizes planning.  The idea of planning covers a lot of territory--from the old Soviet plans to strategic planning.  The former?  His analysis is right on. The latter?  If done well, strategic planning is a boon for an organization and he is not accurate in his judgment. His statement on planning is so broadly stated that it becomes close to meaningless.<br /><br />In the final analysis, the author advances a provocative and useful thesis.  Black swans are important factors in change processes.  How we humans deal with the world tends to make us oblivious to rare and unpredictable events and their consequences.  Very good points.  However, this is hardly a unique insight.  And the supporting logic and rationale is sometimes not so compelling; a focus on the outliers and an exhortation to ignore the routine is unconvincing.  His style of argumentation by dismissal rather than by addressing concrete ideas and theories with which he disagrees is not helpful.  So, it's an intriguing book, but it has problems that the reader needs to evaluate.mples come quickly to mind, such as the dopey political scientist wed to game theory--as if this justifies dismissing the entire discipline from one example], and he obviously falls prey to \\"confirmation bias\\" since he does not challenge his own thesis and try to falsify it but focuses instead on providing evidence to support his perspective [RIP his devotion to Karl Popper].

0312995423|1.0|Definitely the weakest of Dan Brown's novels.  <br /> <br />The plot is very uninteresting, the characters and very bland and one dimensional, and the way the story unfolds is extremely predictable. I could guess the \\"surprise\\" twists at least one or two pages in advance at times. This is a sure sign that the author is very limited in terms of his talent as a suspense writer.  <br /> <br />The only aspect of this novel that is remotely appealing is David Becker's adventure in Spain, and even that isn't all that entertaining.  <br /> <br />Ussually Brown's stongpoint is the inclusion of interesting tidbits and this book has very few of those, if any at all. You can tell this is Brown's first novel without looking up of the year of the copyright. Only read if you are a completist.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|This show is fresh and smart and always had clever idea for new cases and stories yet it was canceled ?? When Smallville which is sorta just dragging on these days is going on to it's 7th season. But hey at least that's way better than 7th Heaven which at least isn't coming back. Why can't the CW bring back Veronica if they could bring back the lame 7th Heaven after canceling it. I got into Veronica Mars the most this season, so it really bugs me that it got canceled. Hell I think everything was canceled but Smallville and Supernatural, so why would they have to cut this show too ? It was actually good even if Veronica could act just a little too much like an overly goofy version of Buffy. It was still a really good unpredictable teen detective show and beats a lot of the crap shows that actually weren't canceled this year!

B000ASDFJU|5.0|I was so excited about getting the Sex and the City series.  I heard from friends the show was funny and read great reveiws about the show.  I was watching it on TBS and WGN, and realized I was missing so much because of editing.  I hesitated purchasing this set from Amazon because of reviews about scratched and damaged DVDs.  I bought it anyway.  The series is funny and addicting.  I loved it, well what I saw of it. My fear came true...Season 2 Disc 2 was highly damaged.  Not only did it skip, but it would not play correctly and the images were all on top of each other.  I talked to Amazon immediately, and I was able to exchange to series without a problem.  The representative was very helpful and I received my new set within a week.  Shipping the damaged set back was not a problem using the UPS label.  I just dropped it of at the nearest UPS store.  Overall, everything went well and I am very satisfied.  I have to now find time to watch the series all over again and make sure I don't have any damaged discs in this set.
B00005JPPL|4.0|He can see the immediate future and adjust his actions until the desired consequence is achieved. From that premise we visit Vegas and the Grand Canyon.

B000PMGNK4|5.0|This film is one of the best things that I have seen come out of the GITS franchise. I have watched the movie several times, each time enjoying even more. I would give a description of the plot, but I will not ruin it for you. My only complaint about Solid State Society is that it borrows ideas from both of the feature-length movies. If you liked GITS: SAC, and most specially 2nd GIG, you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br />Note: It is dubbed in English, unlike Innocence. Amazon just has that fact incorrect <br />
B00067ISBU|5.0|This is one of those movies I've wanted to see since I first saw the trailer in the theatre. For some reason, though, I only saw it today.<br /><br />I should have gone with my first instinct. What a great movie! Clever dialogue that had me laughing out loud, all by myself. Sympathetic yet flawed leads who were easy to root for (especially Ron Perlman, who turns in a dryly hilarious and often touching performance). Awesome special effects that added to rather than detracted from the overall appeal of the movie.<br /><br />While I've never read the Hellboy comics, I do love comics in general and get excited when a movie adaptation of one is actually well made. In which case, Hellboy has me over the moon!

B000P2A256|4.0|Maroon 5 was introduced to me in a time I wasn't fond of their style. \\"Songs About Jane\\", however, grew on me and became part of my iPod collection.  So when this album came out, I was rather surprised at what I heard.  It is a bit of a departure from their first album but it definitely is good on its own merits. <br /> <br />\\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" as a full length original sophomore album definitely sidesteps some of the problems other great first-album artists fall for: mediocrity.  The current album embraces and gives a nod to its original fanbase without placating them.  Musically, they maintain their funky sound and beats but at the same time spread their wings with lyrical maturity that acknowledges growth as performers and individuals. <br /> <br />This album also embraces newer listeners by making their sound catchy enough to be played in public arenas without being cliched. The edge they have honed has a bite that is quite subliminal, growing on the listener that is not quite sure about the M5 sound. That, I think, is a mark of a good album. <br /> <br />I can pick out the songs and nitpick their pros and cons but I always believe that music is subjective and it wouldn't be fair to pick a \\"favorite\\".  However, if you would want to stand on a limb and try something different, give this a shot. It's definitely not \\"Songs About Jane\\" version 2.0.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Know why this is the best live rock album, ever?  Because these guys were the ORIGINAL punk rock musicians.  This music is the essence of youthful exuberance, coupled with unbelieveable musicianship, that led to the advent of what became punk rock in the mid to late-1970's.  I think this album is border-line rock/punk fusion, Return to Forever with fangs and claws.<br /><br />The 15 minute montage of 'My Generation' is just an onslaught of the most unbelieveable guitar, bass and drum work.  What is another alternative for best live rock album; surely not 'Frampton Alive!' (I think the album title includes the exclamation point, right?)  What else?  Please do advise, while you buy this album and rock your brain.
B0004Z33EQ|4.0|I saw \\"Rambo\\" when it first came out, and it stands out more now for its political dimensions than for its cinematic qualities. <br /> <br />It may seem odd, but America tried to tell itself...for quite a while... that it had won the war in Vietnam.  \\"Rambo\\" said something vividly that may seem uncontroversial today, namely that we had lost in Vietnam.  We lost, not because of the failure of the military, but because of a failure of political will.  Our Soldiers weren't allowed to win.   <br /> <br />If you weren't old enough to see this movie when it came out, you need to see it just because it is referenced and parodied by so many other films.
B00008XEP5|5.0|When Hetfield and company were still in High School (and I wasn't even born yet), Diamond Head were already putting out classic metal albums, and \\"Lightning to the Nations\\" is by far their best effort. There's a reason that Metallica, Megadeth, and lots of other bands continuing covering Diamond Head and collaborating with them two decades after this album came out: they were true pioneers in bridging the gap between hard rock and metal, and they did so almost as well as anyone else.  <br /> <br />The vocals keep the music grounded in rock (I even remember reading somewhere that Sean Harris tried to emulate people like Plant of Led Zeppelin). But the instruments are definitely grounded in the metal side (though that side was still evolving at that point). Even the album's slower moments would be copied later by metal bands (e.g., the little riff before the 2nd solo in the song \\"The Prince\\"). I'd recommend this album to just about anyone into either rock or metal (unless you're the type of person who wants everything 200 BPM or faster).
B000N3SRRC|4.0|This is one of Clutch's best works. The songs have a lot of blues influence like you would typically find on Beale St. with a lot of hard rock guitar solos.  AWESOME!
B000002GYR|5.0|Tom Waits's first album \\"Closing Time\\" is appropriately titled, because it perfectly captures the mood of the bar between 1:45 - 2:00 a.m. during last call. This is one of the definitive late night listening discs in my CD collection, and if I had a dollar for every time I've slipped this one on after a night at the bars I could quit my day job. Probably the best known song off of \\"Closing Time\\" is the opening song \\"Ol '55\\" which was later to be covered by The Eagles and Richie Havens, although neither captured the melancholy mood created by Waits. His voice was still young in 1973 and was nowhere near the grit and bombast it would attain on later albums, but his voice was perfectly suited for the songs on this album. \\"Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You\\" is a well written description of the cat and mouse games people play near the end of the night, and gives the listener a glimpse of Waits's talent at the songwriting craft. One of my personal favorites off this disc is \\"Lonely\\", which is a spare and simple melody that never fails to tug at my heart when I hear it. One of the reasons this album is so effective is due to the many moments scattered throughout it that bring a tear to your eye. If you can listen to a song like \\"Martha\\" and not be moved in the slightest your heart must be made of stone. This album and \\"The Heart Of Saturday Night\\" were Waits at his most accessible and I would recommend either to those who are new to the music of Tom Waits. Waits moved further into more challenging realms as his career went on, but this album remains a snapshot of a budding genius.

6305076995|2.0|Back in 1972, the progressive band Yes was in their infancy and with an original line-up of Steve Howe, Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Rick Wakeman and Alan White played most of their songs from the Fragile and Close to the Edge albums. Video quality is poor and grainy as befitting that era and sound is even poorer in PCM stereo. Only for hardcore Yes fans.

1594489505|5.0|To say that Khalil Hosseini had a challenge ahead of him when he started A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS is an understatement.

Well, by returning to the familiar while also telling a different story, Hosseini may have accomplished just that feat in his follow-up to THE KITE RUNNER, A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS.<br /><br />Once again Hosseini takes readers to modern day Afghanistan, mentioning events that take place between 1959 and 2003 as he did in THE KITE RUNNER, but to a large extent this is where the similarity between the two books ends. Unlike its predecessor which was more a plot driven story, A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS focuses more on characters. First we meet Miriam whose life is marked more by tragedy and loss than anything else. At first she's too young to understand what is happening in her world, but as she grows and begins to understand the cruelty is that is much a part of her existence, we feel pity for her. In the second section, we meet Laila, the free spirited daughter of a father who is a teacher and lover of literature and a mother who at once was a spirited woman ahead of her time until losses that seem inevitable in that part of the world overwhelm her. Laila's family lives near the adult Miriam though there's hardly any contact between the neighbors, but Laila's life is far different from that of Miriam. Laila lives in a limited world, but even in its limitations it's a world of possibilities. Her father has hope that Afghanistan's troubles are temporary. Laila has a childhood friend Tariq who was injured by a landmine and the two grow from platonic childhood friends to would be lovers. It only changes when a series of tragedies then enter the picture. Giving more than a description at this point could ruin the power of the book, but in the hands of a writer such as Hosseini, readers can be assured it will be powerful and heart wrenching.<br /><br />As a writer, Hosseini made wise choices by returning to Afghanistan or the setting of his story. He knows the country well and knows there are many stories that can be told. He also made a wise choice in writing a less plot driven novel. By focusing on the characters, he's still able to tell the story in an exciting and engaging manner. In the end, we don't find this work to be the same story as the first, the only difference being the gender of the main characters. We also see some writing techniques that Hosseini seems to love. He's masterful at slight but significant plot twists, occasional slimy characters, and characters that are genuinely emotive<br /><br />I think that fans of THE KITE RUNNER will enjoy A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS. Book clubs will again choose this novel as a selection and I am sure there will be many conversations comparing the two works. If people reading this review have not read THE KITE RUNNER yet, I would recommend doing so. I think the first book does give us a good understanding of modern Afghanistan and its problems and where the first story consists primarily of male main characters in a male oriented world, it does give a reader a frame of reference that makes it easier to read A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS.  If anything, my only criticism of the book, and it's a very slight criticism at that, is that Hosseini may be relying on readers who are familiar with THE KITE RUNNER prior to reading this work, which can be a danger since it's not a sequel. Still, it's an excellent novel and worthy of the many wonderful reviews it has received.Hosseini, readers can be assured it will be powerful and heart wrenching. <br /> <br />As a writer, Hosseini made wise choices by returning to Afghanistan or the setting of his story.

B00005JPQP|5.0|\\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is excellent! The star-studded cast led by George Clooney (as Danny Ocean) is excellent.

1592402038|5.0|This book is fun to read especially if you like anecdotes about the mishaps that can happen without proper punctuation this book has pretty standard information about the use of punctuation presented in a fun memorable way with cute stores historical tidbits and a bit of grammarian sarcasm there is not much new information in this book for those who are already as perfect at placing punctuation as I am but would be an excellent read for an adult who just wants some questions about punctuation answered in a fun way however if you want a book to use for quick look ups of punctuation situations you might prefer Strunk and White's Elements of Style.
0143038419|5.0|To be totally honest, I wasn't sure if I'd like this book when I purchased it, but I picked it up because I'm in LOVE with Italy and I want to read everything I can on what other people experience over there.<br /><br />I was THRILLED with Liz's three months in Rome, because she was explaining things and places I've been and for me to relive them through her eyes was just exciting enough for me to want to return...soon. Her ability to make one feel at home in her life was right on for me and now I'm desperately wanting (dreaming) to follow - somewhat - in her footsteps and head off on my own year of travel and writing.<br /><br />I wasn't as sure about the India & Indonesia parts of her travels, but once I became a part of her life in Rome, I was just as eager to go there with her as I was to stay in Rome. I wanted to stay in India...her experiences were so well written that I felt that pull to not leave, just like she did and the finale in Indonesia came all too soon. I look forward to Liz taking ANOTHER year to search for some other lost part of herself, and taking us along with her...I miss traveling with her and can't wait until she hits the road again!<br /><br />Now, whenever I see her book in the bookstore, I try to make it a little more noticable...stand it upright, make it stick out a little...maybe someone else who wouldn't normally pick a book like that will take her home with them and discover the joy that is Elisabeth Gilbert & Eat, Pray, Love.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My husband asked for the series. He hasn't watched the whole collection but absolutely loves what he has seen thus far.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|When this movie first came out, all I heard was how wonderful it was, how amazing Daniel Craig was as 007. All I have to say to that is what a lie! In my opinion this was the worst Bond movie they have ever made. Craig was extremely boring as Bond. He had absolutely no style, charisma, or humor. The only thing he brought to the role was a nice shape. It was so depressing to me how they replaced the wonderful and talented Pierce for this joke! I'm not saying he's a terrible actor otherwise, but he brought the character to a quick and painful death, that any true bond fan would have winched out. The only decent part of this movie was the supporting cast. Dench was amazing as M, I'm just sorry that she had such a little part in the movie. And Eva Green was fab as the heart breaker. Lets be honest, no body will ever be SC, but at least they could have found someone with a bit more talent and focused less on his psychical condition. I just hope if they choose to make another Bond movie, they add a better supporting cast or something, to make up for Craig's lack of stand.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|As a gift, the receiver was more than pleasantly surprised, especially with the HD version.  Well worth the money, which was quite reasonable for the length of the series.
0736041850|5.0|Very complete in scope. Excellent illustrations. Complete with notes on correct form and hints for avoiding injury. A must have book for strength training.
0823016714|3.0|This book has it's uses.  It is organized by the age of the model, and varies from 20 to 83, both male and female.  The pictures are clear and usable, and I was pleased that they were large enough to work with.  Note that these are head-shots only.  Then at the end of the book, there is a brief section on \\"sequential poses\\" which basically gives you some still frames in transitions between for example a happy and sad face.  There is also a few pages on models speaking the phonemes if you need to do morphing.<br /><br />The problem that I have with this book though is that, like others mentioned, WAY too many of the expressions are these really outrageous over-the-top kinds of things.  I guess you could best describe them as \\"silly\\".  If you are doing some type of animated cartoon or something, these might actually be real useful.  But for any other use they are not nearly as much help as they could be.<br /><br />For comparison's sake, I also have \\"The Artist's Complete Guide To Facial Expression\\" which I feel is a little more useful.  It is organized by expression, and contains a lot of discussion about each one.  The weakness of that book though is that it doesn't have near as much reference material (i.e. pictures) as this book, but at least the ones it does have are in general more useful.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I had wanted to see this movie for a long time and finally did last night.  This movie held my interest from beginning to end.  Helen Mirren deserved her Oscar for her portrayal of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. <br /> <br />This movie covers Tony Blair's landslide election in 1997 and his first meeting with the Queen.  Then we jump to August 30, 1997 when Princess Diana was killed in that infamous car wreck, the aftermath and how the Royal family, especially the Queen, was harshly criticized for not speaking out earlier and trying to comfort her people. <br /> <br />She meant no harm, but truly believed she was doing the right thing by staying at Balmoral and tending to Diana's boys and their emotional needs.  She assumed the \\"people\\" would expect her to remain silent and out of sight.  She couldn't have been more wrong.  She truly had no idea the huge impact Diana's death had on her people or people around the world.  As Prince Charles says in the film, the Diana they knew and experienced had no connection whatsoever to the public Diana and how the public felt about her.  He knew better than anyone how the public felt about Diana, and he knew the awful consequences of ignoring or dismissing that adoration. <br /> <br />As I remember reading in one account at the time that the British people were \\"delirious\\" with grief.  I, myself, felt deeply grieved and depressed for about two weeks after her death.  It hit me hard.  I had gotten up in the wee hours to watch Diana's wedding.  And I got up early to watch her funeral. <br /> <br />Poor Tony Blair tried to tell the Queen what was going on and what she needed to do, and at first the Queen thought he was just wet behind the ears and clueless about \\"her\\" people.  Tony Blair comes to admire and respect the Queen, and even feel affection and sympathy for her.  Her father became King after his brother King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.  Elizabeth's father was never groomed for the throne as his brother had been, and many blamed the stress for his early death.  Upon her father's death, Elizabeth ascended to the throne as a young woman.  As the Queen's aide tells Mr. Blair, the Queen had not experienced something like this (the furor after Diana's death) since the abdication and she was in shock. <br /> <br />Queen Elizabeth redeems herself in the end, and continues to hold the affection of the British people, as well as Americans and millions around the world.  I think this film shows us a stoic, self-contained woman, but a woman who truly wants to have the affection of her subjects and to serve them well. <br />

B0006IIKS0|2.0|Much like the band's music since 1991, Metallica's Some Kind of Monster is a total dud.  All we really get is some \\"insight\\" into what makes Lars and James tick, which is essentially power and control over the band (no surprise to fans).  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE metallica's old stuff, and regard Lars and James' first four albums as essential recordings.  No one is disputing their contribution to heavy metal music, they're kings.  But Metallica's crowns fell off long ago.<br /><br />Lars has managed to turn himself into the most hated figure in rock music, due to his Napster suit, and his incurable case of diarrhea of the mouth.  Somewhat surprising (and one of the only \\"revelations\\" in the film), is that James is a bigger douche than Lars.  He pushed Newsted out of the band, chose his family over his music, and has become the new poster boy for why rock stars should never get sober.  Our old friends from \\"Alcoholica\\" are all washed up, out of beer and out of inspiration.<br /><br />They certainly have balls for putting this out.  It isn't kind to any of them.  How un-rock and roll is this thing anyway?  A therapist for a heavy metal band?  HA!  They all come off like bored, whiny brats, kicking at the dead horse of a once great band, trying to salvage what's already sunk.<br /><br />I can't tell you how hard this is to watch for fans of the old Metallica.  It's like Superman in a wheelchair.  Rock and roll, and especially metal, is supposed to be dangerous.  It's supposed to be hard, fast, and balls out.  It's supposed to be everything Metallica once was.  They really have become some kind of monster.
0751532711|4.0|I first read this book about two years ago and instantly loved it.  I recently read it again hoping to reignite that same enthusiasm I initially experienced.  I'll agree with other posters that a great literary work it is not, however, I have to say that I believe it achieves its intended goal.  This book will prompt one to \\"think outside of the box\\" and for me that was catalyst enough to change how I viewed and ultimately chose to pursue what I wanted to do to earn a living.  Do not buy this book if you are looking for a step by step guide to get rich quick or find investment advice.  It definitely will not provide that.  If you're looking for a book to help facilitate a mindset reset, then you can't go wrong with this one.  I know many successful investors that swear by its contribution to doing just that for them.
0061142026|5.0|A star falls from the sky and the race is on to claim her. A witch seeking a return to youth, evil lords seeking to claim their father's throne, and a half-breed youth hoping to claim his love's hand each try to get the fallen star. The tale can be forgiven his predictability and clich&eacute;s because it is so beautifully written, so amazingly detailed and clever in its fascinating portrayal of the fairy world. Just a wonderful book, one of the best fantasies I've ever read (why can't they all be like this?), right up there with Harry Potter, The Princess Bride, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, Howl's Moving Castle, and The Neverending Story for combining great story with great style and incredibly clever fantasies for adults. Grade: A

The concept of the Law of Attraction is not new for me, I have read already several books on this topic, but this book is very interesting because it contains also a collection of wonderful quotes. It is very well structured and if you have the ability and the inner strength to put into practice all the advices offered by this book, it may really change your life. More than this, the exquisite graphics and general aspect of the book make it an excellent option for a gift.

B0008ENHTE|5.0|I saw this again last night for the first time in years and it reensured what I believe all this time: \\"Bullitt\\" is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. It will take a long time for me to find a movie that can top this. Not only that, but \\"Bullitt\\" is the only movie I know that grabbed my heart and moved me deeply. As evident in the scene, my favorite in which Bullitt's girlfriend Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset-what a class act angel! She's a split image of what fellow Brit Keira Knightley is; as you know they both co-stared in \\"Domino\\" in which Bisset played Knightley's mother) discovers a dead woman strangled and half-naked and later on, Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen) pulls the car over the side of the highway because he knows she is pissed. As she gets out of the car and goes into the grass field, Bullitt follows her. Then she speaks by saying \\"Do you let anything reach you? I mean, REALLY reach you? You think violence is a way of life. Living with violence and death\\". Speaking of that there is a revealing scene in which the witness is shot and eventually killed in the face. Revealing because that's how Martin Luther King died from in the same year of \\"Bullitt\\"'s release. The supporting cast is great which includes Robert Duvall as the cab driver, Don Gordon as Bullitt's partner, Simon Oakland, Norman Fell as the police caption, and last but not least Robert Vaughn as Walter Chalmers-the most evil villian I have ever seen in any movie. This is a man that hates blacks and the police (including Bullitt). The movie along with the car and airport chase is a true masterpiece.
B000P6R6X8|4.0|While many will miss the experimentation and mania of Wilco's two previous LPs, Sky Blue Sky is an immediate and superb collection of songs.  To release another album of obtuse and ingenious tracks might have been just a little too much, and if Kicking Television taught us anything, it's that at their heart, Wilco is a band not afraid of simply great melodies and making the utmost of standard instrumentation.  Sky Blue Sky is the logical next step for a band that has been through many a mill and maybe, for a moment anyway, is ready to settle back and play.
074322454X|5.0|OK, I am not done with it yet, but will be in the next day or so. I have never found a book to keep my interest very long, even small books, but this one is a great book to read, action, true life experiences, and very informational. I have not seen the series in order yet, just when i can catch them on tv, but plan to after i finish this book. I would recomment this book to anyone.
0393307050|5.0|Master and Commander sets a very high bar for the rest of the novels in the Aubrey/Maturin series.  <br />O'Brian is a writer of immense qualities, and his ability to relate the intricacies of naval warfare in the beginning of the 19th century is both immersive and enjoyable. O'Brian does not start with a remarkable character, but builds him from the ground up, and builds up his friendship with Maturin as well. Viewers of the Master and Commander movie saw Aubrey in command of a ship of the line, but that is 10 books into the series, and at the start of this book Aubrey is a lieutenant without a ship. <br />The book is thoroughly laden with action, but it is a welcome break from the pattern that most authors assume of building to an immense action at the end of the book. O'Brian scatters action and excitement throughout, and there is still plenty of book left when the largest bit of action is done, and they are not boring pages to be skimmed till the finish.  <br />Master and Commander is easily one of the best historical novels out there and one of the most enjoyable pieces of literature I have yet read. After reading this book, the next three came in quick succession, and I am sure the others will be soon to follow
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|The message of this film is quite disturbing. The main theme of this film is to murder or inflict violence upon everything you disagree with or that is corrupt, evil, or has harmed you. <br /> <br /> Its a very base and bestial film that hides its true nature wrapped in eloquent British speech and supposedly high ideals. At least films like Hostel have no pretense, it spoonfeeds its audience violence and sadism for enjoyment. But offers no excuses, justifications, or distortions. <br /> <br /> This film does the same thing but offers self-righteousness to try and persuade the viewer that the course of action taken in the film is the correct one. <br /> <br /> Hatred and violence is shown in such a casual way in this film that it offers an easy seduction.  <br /> The worst type of film IMO.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|From This Moment On~ Diana Krall is easy listening jazz at its best. Ms Kralls vocal skills are remarkable and she sings these traditional jazz tunes with conviction and fortitude of a grandmaster of jazz. The book-let is beautifull if a bit sparse. The photographs are simply put it amazing and she looks stunning. The production value is right on the money and I like it since it so easy to listen to even for jazz beginners such as myself. Highly recommended indeed and I easily give this album 5 out of 5 stars.
1594489505|5.0|In the highly anticipated book that followed the best seller, The Kite Runner, Khaled Hosseini has not failed to captivate my attention once again!  What an amazing read!  The pain, the joy and every emotion in between was expertly captured by Hosseini in his story of two women from two different ways of life coming together in Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion and the subsequent Taliban rule.  I could not put this book down and I hated reaching the last page.  I think this book was well worth the wait and Hosseini definitely has another best seller on his hands!  I am currently in the Middle East and have seen firsthand what the Taliban rule has done to Afghanistan and the women there....it is something that one can not understand how such a human rights atrocity was able to take place under the world's nose.  My heart goes out to the women who are now finding their place in the world.  One must not forget the pain and suffering and I think that Hosseini was able to capture these emotions within the pages of A Thousand Splendid Suns.  I would recommend that you pick this book up and give it a read!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I first heard of the movie 'An Inconvenient Truth' watching the last Oscars where it won the Best Documentary award. I was somewhat surprised that a politician was the purveyor of this movie. The skeptic in me thought it was reelection propaganda but when I got to see the movie this morning, the messenger (US Vice President Al Gore) and his motives became insignificant next to the message.    In the movie, there were some throwbacks to his personal life and political career that in my opinion should have been in the features section of the DVD instead. It was a bit confusing as you would expect to be watching about the problem with the environment but instead, you get snippets of Al Gore's life here and there. But over-all, the snippets seemed to provide a pause during which you have time to get yourself ready for another dollop of facts and figures. And I say dollop not chunk because the information was presented in a well thought out manner - simple, not rocket science terms were used, video was used judiciously to illustrate a process, graphs and charts were used judiciously as well. In other words, easily digestible.    But it does pack a punch. In the space of 1 1/2 hours, you learn the official definition of global warming by watching how it happens, the effects of global warming on worldwide temperatures, marine life and other species, sea levels, hurricanes, human diseases. The impact is worldwide - anyone and everyone who is on this planet cannot escape the consequences. The impact is cumulative - if we sit on our butts and wait around, it may be too late when we finally wake up.    As Melissa Etheridge's accompanying song puts it: 'I need to wake up... I need to shake up'. I was half expecting the movie to end with a doomsday tone so that it could really wake up and shake up people into doing something to reverse the trend. But instead, the movie ended on a positive note - we as a people in this day and age have the capacity to solve this problem; it's just a matter of perception on the individual level whether we think there's a problem or whether global warming is what God intended i.e. a natural phenomenon.    It does boil down to the individual. But sometimes with problems like this which are on a massive-scale, a person can feel lost and not know where to start. The website tie-up can help: (...). It includes a link where you can 'Calcuate your personal impact' i.e. calculate how much carbon dioxide you are emitting into the atmosphere and how you can reduce your CO2 emissions. The suggestions may seem oriented toward those living in the U.S. so you may want to check local websites for more suggestions on how to help in this effort in your area. In Singapore, I've come across some recently published issues of magazines dealing with the environment namely 8 Days and Shape. There are very useful and localized tips and reminders in these.

B000Y7U98C|2.0|For 83 minutes, Danny Boyle's Sunshine is an above average sci-fi film with a great hook - a potential suicide mission to reignite the dying sun - and, if not entirely realistic (the sun's far too powerful to approach even with heat shields), it's at least credible enough to dispel any worries that this is going to turn out to be Solar Crisis 2. Thanks to some excellent character development (with one underwritten exception in Troy Garity's case), the first two thirds work because the focus is kept firmly on the human element, and it's human error that is the root cause of the increasing obstacles that threaten the mission. When things go wrong at first, it's a series of logical consequences of a mathematical error, and the film follows these through with a mechanical logic, constantly proving adept at offering hope only to remove it.<br /><br />Unfortunately it misses a few opportunities by keeping too cool a head at times: rather than tempers rising along with the temperature and rational decision making being affected by the purely physical effects of an increasingly hostile environment providing the drama, Boyle and writer Alex Garland show the same confusion over how to end this picture as they famously did with 28 Days Later and decide to introduce an external threat which takes the phrase deus ex machina to new lows. The nature of the threat didn't work for George Pal in the 1950s and works even worse here.<br /><br />Things start to get dodgy around an airlock sequence where it's revealed that tinfoil and holding your breath might just work in a minus 272 degree vacuum. And, in retrospect, it seems unbelievable that the life of the only crewmember who knows how to program their payload would be risked needlessly out of a fit of pique from one character earlier in the film (or indeed that on such a crucial mission there would be only one crewmember to know how to do it). But it's with the introduction of an anomaly on the oxygen supply that the film's IQ drops to single figures as it makes a sudden severe shift of genre and into the realms of absurdity. Characters don't communicate and put themselves needlessly at risk, Chris Evans suddenly develops such an immunity to low temperatures you're wondering if you're watching outtakes from Fantastic Four and, what's even worse is that having created two more than efficient female characters in Michelle Yeoh and Rose Byrne, it gives them absolutely nothing to do in the attempts to salvage the mission, deciding instead to reduce them to dispensable victims: that's just so 70s, Danny. Just to put the tin lid on it, even within its own suddenly limited ambitions, these sequences are extremely poorly executed with a notable lack of tension and an almost comical belief that blurring the screen or smearing the lens with Vaseline is inherently frightening. And it gets confusing as hell. I don't think I've seen a film so completely shoot itself in the foot in the home stretch since Tequila Sunrise.<br /><br />Within this section there are still some good moments, but if only they'd removed the external element and reshot and reedited the ending and put their faith in the inherent drama of the premise. Like throwing a lion at a character attempting to walk a tightrope over a pit of alligators while under heavy machine-gun fire to up the risk factor (Armageddon not enough for you, boys?), it simply reduced the audience to laughter. A shame, because it coulda been a contender (still could if they cut out one character, do a quick reshoot and re-edit for the States), but despite some good visuals and strong performances (particularly Hiroyuki Sanada and Cliff Curtis in what could have been throwaway parts) I just left the theatre thinking how much more technically accomplished the ending of Event Horizon was, and that's never a good thing.<br /><br />And it started out so well...gures as it makes a sudden severe shift of genre and into the realms of absurdity. Characters don't communicate and put themselves needlessly at risk, Chris Evans suddenly develops such an immunity to low temperatures you're wondering if you're watching outtakes from Fantastic Four and, what's even worse is that having created two more than efficient female characters in Michelle Yeoh and Rose Byrne, it gives them absolutely nothing to do in the attempts to salvage the mission, deciding instead to reduce them to dispensable victims: that's just so 70s, Danny.

Like throwing a lion at a character attempting to walk a tightrope over a pit of alligators while under heavy machine-gun fire to up the risk factor (Armageddon not enough for you, boys?), it simply reduced the audience to laughter. A shame, because it coulda been a contender (still could if they cut out one character, do a quick reshoot and re-edit for the States), but despite some good visuals and strong performances (particularly Hiroyuki Sanada and Cliff Curtis in what could have been throwaway parts) I just left the theatre thinking how much more technically accomplished the ending of Event Horizon was, and that's never a good thing.     And it started out so well...
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I have seen Madonna live in concert several times.  This tour was indeed the best.  The confessions tour is a combination of the best dance music Madonna has put together and a show that is very similar to a Cirque de Soleil performance. Controversial as always and extremely contagious. I recommend this DVD to all Madonna fans.
B000002UAU|3.0|This is a classic case of misplaced admiration, which starts a bandwagon into motion which so many seem compelled to jump upon.  Who knows what got it started.  It doesn't really matter.  Now for the truth.   <br /> <br />Sgt Pepper, Lucy in the Sky, A Day in the Life, are good songs.  Not great songs.  Just good.  The rest of it is boring, forgettable mediocrity.  Shouldn't the \\"greatest album of all time\\"  offer at least a wee bit more?  This is not a knock against the Beatles.  McCartney and Lennon truly deserve the accolades they're received as songwriters.  I suspect those two got a laugh over the years at all the praise for what they probably secretly consider only an average work. <br /> <br />You want a truly \\"great\\" album, from the same era?  Try \\"Aqualung\\" by Jethro Tull, or other Beatle albums, at least four of which are better than Sgt Pepper.
0312995423|3.0|it's an OK thriller and a great book to take on a trip. <br /> <br />The plot centers around a computer security.  A disgruntled former federal employee has developed a code that will wreck havoc on computer security.  An ultra secret federal agency director dispatches the best agent available to retrieve this code.  The 'agent' in question happens to be a language professor who also happens to be engaged to the beautiful, brilliant chief code breaker of this same agency.  As the young lovers struggle back to each other they encounter many dead bodies, a hired assassin, traitors, unrequited lovers, numerous double crosses and miraculous escapes.   <br /> <br />This is not great literature by any means, and falls far short of THE DAVINCI CODE or ANGELS AND DEMONS.  The characters range from cardboard to...no cardboard pretty much sums it up.  The plot is contrived and hinges on far too many coincidences.  So why read this at all?  I took this one on a long trip.  The chapters are short, the action interesting enough to keep you awake while waiting to board your flight, and the plot not so complicated that frequent interruptions are a problem.  It is definitely more interesting than staring at the seat back in front of you but not so compelling that you hate to put it down.  So get this book to take on a trip, to read while waiting for the kids when driving carpool etc.

B000AOEMXM|5.0|I loved the series.  I only wish they had made more after season 4.  I thought the crew worked well together personality wise and the story lines were great.  I especially liked the relationship between Trip and T'pol. It's about time they allowed a romance between crew members.  Does anyone know if their planning to make series 5?
0375822429|5.0|I think that this is a great book, I mean, the funniest part is when the Twits find their living room upside down. The scariest part is when they shrink into their own bodies, into a pile of clothes and shoes! You should read it; I highly recommend it.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|This movie sucked.  Too sentimental for one thing.
B000NA2348|4.0|I love this album.  The original stereo mix is great.  Great songs, great performances, great sound.  I'm not even going to get into that.  My review is for those of you strictly curious about the 5.1 mix.    The 5.1 mix, in short, is awful.  If you've ever thought to yourself, \\"Boy, I wish that bongo drum was loud as hell\\" or \\"Why can't those backup singers sound like they're singing in a garage down the road?\\" then maybe you'll like this.  The strut and soul of these songs is lost in the obnoxious frills of this surround mix.  There are constant issues with the reverb on both lead and backup vocals.  I'm sure the original tracks are hard to deal with, but the effects that make this album sound like a classic piece of coked-out 70's soul only sound awkward when shifting around in the stereo field at any instant.  The only track that I find even interesting to hear in 5.1 is \\"Win\\".  The worst tragedy of this remix is \\"Fame\\".  It sounds so dry and brittle that I can't even handle it.  This isn't \\"Fame\\".  This is something else...  Then again \\"Fascination\\" sucks pretty bad too.  Man, what a waste of money.    The Dick Cavette show stuff is great though.  Bowie just can't quit fidgeting with that cane.    (...)
B000NIWI9K|5.0|For my taste, Glyndebourne 2006 new production of Cosi fan tutte is the best DVD version for this opera. Ivan Fisher is an excellent Mozartian, and the young and good-looking cast sings and acts with a lot of enthusiasm. The best singers are the wonderful Swedish Miah Persson as Fiordiligi, and the Italian baritone Luca Pisaroni as Guglielmo. Highly recommended!!
0141301066|5.0|I think this is a good book. The part I like the most,(you might too,) is when Matilda writes on the blackboard,( controlling the chalk with her eyes) \\"I will get you!\\" I feel so sad when the Trunchbull attack the kids with her strong right arm. I say you should read it.

B00005JPLW|5.0|300 is a classic film, a work of art, a kick@$$ action flick and a piece of effective political propaganda. Those who suggest that it distorts history or represents myth just don't get it. Frank Miller was very explicit that the graphic novel is exagerated and allegorical.<br /><br />He didn't spell it out for us, but a little thinking should lead to understanding. Persia is the same place geographically as as today's Iran and Iraq. The Persian attack on Greece, the cradle of Western civilization, parallels the Jihadists' attack on Western society and culture. In the book Miller constantly reiterates that the battle<br /><br />is one of democracy, freedom and justice against oriental tyranny,<br /><br />sensuality and slavery. The analogies should be obvious. Despite the fact that Western media pundits pretended not to get it, Iran certainly did, condemning the film in no uncertain terms, even creating a website to counter it. How many action films do you know of that have major world powers creating websites in order to combat them?
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I would be glad to review this DVD if I had order the right one.I got the HD DVD. I opened it to fine out that I don't have a HD DVD player.

B000002GQE|5.0|This is the best of the The Moody Blues. I have this on a LP record,Cass, and now a cd.
B00005JPRT|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that defies any neat classification.  It isn't a traditional love story by any stretch.  Though it is filled with music from beginning to end it isn't really a musical.  In the traditional musical characters will suddenly burst into song but it represented an interruption in the otherwise semi-realistic tone of the movie--think of Gene Kelly in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  But all the songs in this film are in line with the overall realism of the film, they are all songs that occur in normal life.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal much in the way of details about the movie since much of the joy of the film is discovering the ways it defies expectations.  In broad outline it is about a street singer who has put his emotional life on cold storage because of a broken heart and the woman he meets who helps him open himself back up to life.  During the day in Dublin he sings familiar standards for tips but at night, when the crowds thin out, he sings his own original material.  We see him this way for the first time through the eyes of the Girl as she first meets him (in the credits the two lead characters, never addressed by name, are listed as Guy and Girl).  He, played by Frames' frontman Glen Hansard, is singing an absolutely stunning song with intense passion.  As he finishes, the camera pulls back to reveal her standing there.  From thenceforward we see the two of them get to know each other as they perform a string of amazing songs together.<br /><br />Neither Glen Hansard nor Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; is a professional actor.  Hansard did have a prominent role in another great Dublin film about music, THE COMMITMENTS.  In that one Hansard played the band's guitarist Outspan Foster, one of the two original members of the band (he is the one who resists the suggestion of the other original member to call their band A Flock of Budgies).  In real life, of course, Hansard has long been the resident genius of the great Irish rock band The Frames and both one of the great singers in rock as well as an absolutely brilliant songwriter (neither of which anyone who sees this movie will be inclined to doubt).  While visiting Prague a couple of years back he met a precocious teenager who was none other than Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;. One thing led to another and within a year of their meeting they recorded and album together entitled THE SWELL SEASON.  Next they appeared in this film by John Carney, himself a former member of The Frames.  So their time together has been amazingly productive (she also appeared on the critically acclaimed new album by the Frames, THE COST).<br /><br />The film is filled with wonderful little moments, like the first meeting (driven by Hansard's magnificent performance of \\"Say It To Me Now\\").  Or the way the sound engineer recording the Guy's song goes from disinterest to interest as he realizes just how good he is.  Or the marvelous extended shot that follows the Girl from a convenience store where she has bought batteries for a CD player down the street for a few blocks as she sings the lyrics she has written for a song the Guy has written the music for.<br /><br />This truly is a very special film.  It does not have the greatest production values; indeed, it feels like the low budget that it is.  It works because the two leads, while not professional actors, have a wonderful chemistry both romantically and musically and because Glen Hansard is one of the finest songwriters around.  In fact, the soundtrack for the film has to go down as one of the greatest soundtracks ever released.  I would urge anyone who loves the music in this film to investigate not merely the soundtrack for the film, but both THE SWELL SEASON, the album by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, and two albums by the Frames, FITZCARRALDO and THE COST.<br /><br />Update 8/8/07<br /><br />I just read today on IMDB.com that Twentieth Century Fox, which owns the distribution rights to the movie,has been so pleased with its performance so far - nearly $7 million in box office on only 140 screens - that they are going to release it to a much larger number of screens and give it a publicity push.  Obviously this means that this gem will be granted a much larger audience.  Hopefully it will garner the kind of acclaim it deserves.ce on only 140 screens - that they are going to release it to a much larger number of screens and give it a publicity push.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is the best, most believable, bond movie in my opinion.  It has a lot good action scenes.  Daniel Craig played this character very well.  For all the die hard bond fans, you might be dissapointed.  This movie doesn't have all the classic gadgets and villans.  That is why it is believable.  In all a descent flick.
B00007FOMP|5.0|With the release of \\"What's Going On\\" in 1971, Marvin Gaye ignited the social consciousness movement in music. With a senseless war in Vietnam, and racism still prominent in America. Pollution of our water and the air we breath. And Black unemployment levels continuously rising, Marvin hit a spot that had been sorely lacking in music, with the exception of maybe Curtis Mayfield. And like Mayfield's \\"People Get Ready\\" he did it with a spiritual solution: \\"God Is Love\\", \\"Wholy Holy\\".     It was America's time to stop and finally ask the question, \\"what is going on?\\" And now with another war raging in the Middle East, the question is still relevant today. Marvin's spiritual answers remain the only hope for this world in the 21st century. A thought provoking recording, smoothly edited with an operatic flow of listening, resulting in Marvin Gaye's masterpiece and most redeeming effort.
B00006AFUR|4.0|All of this bands albums to date are descent.  This is their first major release.  It's a little bit more electronic than \\"a beautiful lie.\\"  But there are some very descent songs on this album.  It gets a bit repeditive towards the end of the album, so be prepared for that.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|Rush is one band whose music and lyrics are always superb. Imagine my disappointment when I heard the indifferent sound quality and non-existent mastering. It falls prey to the thing live concerts always do: the giant purple monster: the audience. If those Brazilians had just put a sock in it, maybe we just might have something. I cannot see that in an age of digital recording/mastering that this collection of noise could be seriously released as a high priced album. And I know such live albums has successfully been done: Genesis Seconds Out (1977), U2 Under A Blood Red Sky (1983), Simple Minds Live In The City Of Lights (1990), and your pick of Pink Floyd performances. If these live concerts can sound good with primitive caveman equipment, I wonder what happened. I know: it's the Brazilians that happened. I am sorry I have write such review concerning RUSH, but, if you cannot enjoy something with such price tag, then buyers beware.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I was first introduced to the wonderful talents of Michael Buble while I was looking for the song \\"Sway\\" on iTunes. Ever since, I've been hooked to Mr. Buble's music. <br /> <br />Michael Buble's performance thoughout the DVD is downright remarkable. He performed the songs that can be found on the CD as well as a few surprises here and there. Somewhere after track 10 on the DVD, Buble performs a cover edition of Maroon 5's \\"This Love\\". I'm a huge Maroon 5 fan and Michael's performance was hillarious when he made up words to the rest of the song because he didn't know (or remember) them.  <br /> <br />Anyway, if you're looking for a glimpse of what the atmosphere at a Michael Buble concert is like, check out this DVD. It takes place at what seems to be a classy venue and the people in the DVD have so much fun dancing and singing to his popular songs.
B00005JPAO|5.0|The troubled period around the death of Princess Diana was superbly conveyed through this powerful masterpiece. The events that rocked the House of Windsor and the same year Tony Blair came to power added to this already turbulent period in the history of the monarchy. Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen was impeccable, a tribute to her acting talents which was deservedly awarded with an Oscar. This film is an excellent insight into the background of the Royal Family, their quest to maintain their monarchy and ultimately the Queen's surrender to public opinion. I would rate this as an all time classic in the history of the film industry.

B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna fills a void and provides a great soundtrack for Summer 2007 with \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\". The diversity of the CD makes this one of the most interesting collections to come out recently.

Mid-tempo cuts include current hit \\"Umbrella\\", \\"Rehab\\", and Ne-Yo duet \\"Hate That I Love You\\". If you need a little reggae-flavor for an island getaway, \\"Lemme Get That\\" and \\"Sell Me Candy\\" is here for you. Rihanna is a star who gets better as she gets \\"badder\\". This CD is recommended.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|Canadian crooner, Michael Bubl&eacute; could sing the phone book and render it poetic. Thankfully, he does an album of mostly covers, with big band arrangements in places, and sparse, whispering arrangements in others.<br /><br />It's great to see that albums like this can still top the Billboard charts which seem to be cluttered with Hip hop acts these days. The album also got to #2 in the UK.<br /><br />Falling into the big band treatment are songs like \\"L.O.V.E.', \\"I've got the world on a string\\" (with a live feel), \\"Call me irresponsible, \\"The best is yet to come\\", \\"That's life\\" (with a gospel choir flitting in and out), and an excellent remake of Leonard Cohen's \\"I'm your man\\". The only other cover of this song that I enjoy is Nick Cave's which featured on the soundtrack \\"Leonard Cohen: I'm your man\\" (a fantastic CD too).<br /><br />Eric Clapton's \\"Wonderful tonight gets an acoustic, piano sprinkled makeover, with bilingual lyrics, it's a duet with Brazilian Ivan Lins. Billy Paul's \\"Me and Mrs Jones\\" gets the quiet storm treatment, while \\"Comin' home baby\\" features beautiful harmonising from Boyz II Men, giving it a soulful feel.<br /><br />Getting the sparse treatment are the beautiful \\"Lost\\" (a Bubl&eacute; original which already sounds like a classic), \\"Everything\\" (another Bubl&eacute; original), \\"Dream\\" (remniscent of Charlie Chaplin's \\"Smile\\"), and a stunning rendition of \\"Always on my mind\\", which starts off as a delicate piano ballad with strings and subtle shuffling percussion creeping in after the first chorus.<br /><br />Standout, and my favourite is \\"It had better be tonight (Meglio Stasera)\\", a charming, upbeat salsa horn drenched rendering, similar to Donna Summer's (yes) performance of this in the early 70s.<br /><br />Awesome!!<br /><br />If you like this, try \\"From this moment on\\" by Diana Krall, and \\"Catching tales\\" and \\"Twentysomething\\" by avant garde Brit Jamie Cullum.
0451209338|4.0|The Kill Artist, by Daniel Silva, is the author's first book featuring Art Restorer and Secret Agent Gabriel Allon.  This complex character is a welcome entry into the thriller & espionage genre.  We also meet several of Allon's closest allies, including Ari Shamron who is Allon's boss/father figure.  This book does in print what the film Munich did visually.  Silva does a nice job in explaining that there really are no winners in this ongoing strife in the Middle East, just survivors.  This book features an excellent plot in which Allon may be called upon to protect and save one of Israel's greatest enemies.  The personal demons that Allon battles are always present as he tries to justify and rationalize his actions to himself.  The tidbits we learn about art restoration along the way make this book even more fun to read.  It is not a thrill a minute Ludlum knock-off, this is a sometimes cerebral read involving much of the mundane minutia of working in a world of codes, surveillance, and angst.  I strong 4-star book and a precursor of the greatness to come.
0618680004|3.0|The author's stated goal in writing \\"The God Delusion\\" is to convert theists or agnostics to atheism or to at least raise the reader's awareness to several points, including that atheists are generally moral and intelligent people, who possess a healthy independence of mind, and who should be proud of their atheism. The author writes outside of his special area of expertise, which is evolutionary biology. The book covers quite a lot of material in 10 chapters, much of it covered before in books by other authors. Its main strength is that it brings together into one place information on many different issues. It is also very well written and entertaining. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 discusses deserved and undeserved respect and places religious beliefs in the latter category for reasons that are stated. <br /> <br />Chapter 2 defines and discusses the so-called \\"God Hypothesis\\". The \\"God Hypothesis\\" states that there exists a supernatural God that created the universe and everything in it, including us. Other kinds of \\"Gods\\" are excluded. <br /> <br />The core of the book is contained in chapters 3 and 4, which summarize arguments for the existence of a supernatural god and presents Dawkins' argument for the improbability of the existence of God. Chapter 3 is what might be found in any introductory philosophy textbook. Chapter 4, Dawkins' argument for the probable nonexistence of God requires a naturalistic/scientific world view in order to make sense. Those who have a purposeful or supernatural world view will probably not be convinced by his arguments. <br /> <br />The remainder of the book covers topics such as where morals come from, the probable roots of religion, religion as form of child abuse, and what's wrong with religion. The book does an outstanding job of showing that morals do not come from scripture. I would argue that the book also shows that morals do not come from God, because morals change while God is unchanging. <br /> <br />In all, the book is a verygood read and I recommend it highly. But don't look for any great new insights; I just don't think it contains any.

B00005QDW5|5.0|Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, is a great introduction to this classic ahead of its time rock group.  For those of you not born in the 50's or 60's that could have enjoyed the classic Dark Side of the Moon during its release, this is a tremendous way to find out what all of the fuss was/is about.  I am certain that this great CD set will inspire people to purchase much of the Pink Floyd collection, especially some of the bigger hits like The Wall and Dark Side.  Many of these songs are simply haunting, while others prove to show how versatile this super group has been over the years.  An outstanding value.  5 Stars!<br /><br />~ Pink Floyd
1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now is a greater power than any other. I was reading this when I just started ACIM's workbook, and I was able to experience what Tolle has been talking about. One night, as I got into bed, I decided to stay present as long as I could before I fell asleep. I eventually reached a point where my whole body was full of intense bliss, and it never ran out. It was unlimited (well, until I fell asleep). Since then I have had many similar occurances, and I have been able to tap into it a little bit throughout every day. It is so much better than anything in the world, and I know that I have just begun.<br /><br />Skepticism, blaming, and complaining about spiritual authors is not going to help you out. From my experiences, listening to these authors and applying their messages have changed my life greatly. Just listen to them! They are here to offer what they have found. Eckhart Tolle's works are here to help and not to insult. This is perhaps the greatest book I have read. I believe you can go all the way to complete spiritual awakening with A Course in Miracles and the Power of Now in hand. This book has changed my life, and it will surely change yours if you allow it to do so.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for Destruction - by Guns N' Roses - is one of the best Rock and Roll albums to be released in the decades before and the decades that followed.  It was jolt of electricity to the Rock and Roll scene.  There were songs here for fans of every genre as the hit Sweet Child O' Mine and Welcome To The Jungle were crossover hits enjoyed by metal fans and pop fans alike.  The impact of these songs are still felt today, as Jungle is even played at NBA basketball games, and sports radio talk shows.  But the real gems on this CD are the harder rocking offerings like It's So Easy, Nightrain, and My Michelle.  If I have to put together my \\"stranded on a desert island list\\" this CD easily makes the cut.  My personal favorites are Think About You and Rocket Queen.  There is not a weak song amongst this group.  The title is appropriate as the only thing that could derail this outstanding group was its own appetite for destruction, and new faces both literally and figuatively.  I did have th opportunity to catch Guns and Roses in concert (with Metallica) in Oakland, and they were excellent.<br /><br />If you are looking for the definitive post 70's rock and roll album, you have found it.  Tremendous... 5 strong stars! Enjoy.
B0009EP020|5.0|Green Day was one of my faviorte bands growing up. I still enjoyed Green Day through out the years but not as much as I did in fifth grade. Warning didnt have too many songs that I liked and I really didnt know what was in store for the band next. American Idiot came out and everyone is jumping on the band wagon or screaming sell outs. My view? It describes where I am in my life. Wake Me Up When September Ends describes my life and touches me deeply. The only track I dont really care for is Boulevard Of Broken Dreams; Maybe because its over played on the radio or Kids Bop sang it. Perfect soundtrack to a kid growing up now or a fan who listened to Dookie but is a little more mature now.  <br />
B000001FS3|5.0|There are defining moments in a music groups career, and music in general.  The Joshua Tree, by U2, is one of those moments.  From radio hits to impressive, reflective, and profound songs, this CD has it all.  I was fortunate enough to see U2 in concert in San Fracisco for this tour.  It was an incredible experience.  If there are any people out there who have not heard this album/CD, this is a must have, and I envy you the joy of discovering this masterpiece.<br /><br />The best songs on this CD were never released as singles.  Three of my favorites and worthy of the purchase price alone are:<br /><br />Bullet The Blue Sky<br /><br />Running To Stand Still<br /><br />and Red Hill Mining Town, my personal favorite.<br /><br />This is a 5 star excellent CD, treat yourself to this one.  If you haven't heard it, or are new to U2, this is one to run out and buy.  If you have been a fan like me - for years - this CD version is a must have!

He makes two very close friends, though, a brother and sister named Patrick and Sam.  They are much older than he is and expose him to many new things during the year.  Charlie is very much in love with Sam and very devoted to Patrick, who is having a tough time in a gay relationship with a football player who doesn't want anyone to know he is gay. <br /> <br />Throughout the course of the year, Charlie experiments with dating, although he never dates Sam, the girl he lusts after.  Charlie goes to parties, tries drugs, and drives his older sister to get an abortion.  All the while, though, there is something holding him back from participating completely in the world around him.  What is going on in Charlie's head?  Is there a reason why he is so reserved? <br /> <br />I really liked the characters of Sam and Patrick.  I thought it was nice the way they related to each other, and the way Patrick was so open with his homosexuality.  They seemed to be very solid and secure characters.  I also liked seeing the way Charlie's relationship with his sister developed, until she trusted him enough to let him drive her to the clinic. <br /> <br />I didn't really like the character of Charlie.  I didn't understand, with his strange personality and whininess, how he managed to make friends.  I also didn't like the style of the book, with letters being written to nobody.  I would have liked a regular narrative style better.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Most unsuspecting movie-goers would have been falsely led into believing that this would be a slash-fest. Even more so, coming from the director of \\"Se7en\\". What most of them probably forgot that he was also responsible for 1999's most cerebral film: Fight Club. <br /> <br />As the tagline goes: There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer. It perhaps sums up the whole thesis or gist of the film. Even though this film is about the elusive Zodiac killings that plagued San Fransisco in the late 60s, well into the 70s; it is actually a by-the-book standard procedural investigative drama. It is not so much of a murder mystery that every Agatha Christie's fans will be anticipating. Even though the real identity of Zodiac remains the \\"Macguffin\\" of the whole movie. <br /> <br />This film is broken down into 3 main acts. The first act consist of flamboyant journalist, Paul Avery, played with equal flamboyance by ex-alcoholic Robert Downey Jr., whose initial disinterest and outward passiveness hides a dark and unhealthy obsession over the killings and the killer himself. Interestingly, the film managed to hide his obsession, well into the third act. <br /> <br />The second act plays out like a fly-on-the-wall docudrama  CSI-style drama series. The focus here is on Mark Ruffalo's homicide detective whose persistence and perseverance is well commended but again, leads to a cul-de-sac. <br /> <br />The final act unravels itself with an understated role played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays the author of the book of which of the film was based on. Gyllenhaal imbues a subdued performance in the first act, only to shine out with an equal, if not surpassing Paul Avery's obsession, morbid obsession over the killer's identity. Even though not explicitly shown, his whole social and family life falls apart as his obsession deepens. <br /> <br />Throughout all these acts, the catalyst that glues all three characters is the Zodiac killer or suspect himself. The killings portrayed which are punctuated throughout all three acts, were no doubt stylish and even shocking. But the real deal comes from John Carroll Lynch, who plays the only prime suspect in the whole affair. Quite a remarkable intense, albeit brief performance. <br /> <br />David Fincher weaves a fine tale of obsession that probably put Brian DePalma's \\"Black Dahlia\\" in disgrace. All three protagonists' lives are intertwined with each other, all hurtling towards disappointment, delusions and ultimately, in Graysmith's case, a catharsis that is so anti-climatic that will leave the audience questioning themselves, whether all that effort was really worth it.

LP needed to change their sound because eventually it will become too easy for other bands to mimic their sound. You aren't a true fan if you don't like this album, sorry.

0618551050|5.0|Smolin's book \\"The Trouble With Physics\\" is a very candid account of what the author percieves to be \\"wrong\\" with physics as it is being practiced in today's large research universities.  Smolin's writing is clear and matter-of-fact.  Although he makes his opinions known he is not demeaning to those with whom he disagrees, which makes the polemic all the more effective.    Smolin takes aim at the current diadem of theoretical physics research, String Theory, and attempts to shed light on the true nature and promise of the theory. Smolin's main thesis is that String Theory, and the culture that has grown up around it, is essentially stifling theoretical physics.  He shows that string theory has produced no unique, testable predictions and that recent developments in the field suggest that there may be as many as 10^500 different string theories thus making it unlikely that the theory could ever be falsified (for perspective, it is estimated that there are 10^80 atoms in the entire universe).  Essentially what this means is that string theory can be taylored to fit any experimental data and, thus, can never be proven wrong.    Smolin argues convincingly that String Theory is not even really a theory in the scientific sense.  It is more of \\"hunch\\" or a \\"conjecture\\".  That is, while some of the consequences of the theory have been ascertained, the mathematical structure of the theory remains largely unknown.  Furthermore, no one really has any idea of what the overall structure might look like, or how it might be rigorously developed.  As a result, hundreds of millions of research dollars are being poured into the elucidation of a project which has made no unique testable predictions, offers no practical applications, and in which only one person (Ed Witten) has made any truly significant advances over the past 15 years.     In spite of all this, what I found most interesting was the pure dysfunctionality of the physics community.  The ideological bickering, and the petty struggles for power and prestigue are pretty ironic considering that that hot-shots of the physics community often consider themsleves to have reached the very pinnacle of rationality.  It's kind of sad really, and perhaps unavoidable in a situation where certain people are given so much power and authority.  But, Smolin believes it can be better than it currently is.  I believe that he is right and hope that people in positions of power at our major research universities will take his criticisms to heart.

Their timing is impeccable.  <br />Besides being romantic in nature, the music also has it's twists and turns combining jazz with rock and soft blues all in one. I am very very pleased......make some more music guys & hurry it up! I have only become recently aware of this group and boy let me tell you I've been missing alot. Great work guys, another great compilation of work. Keep it up!
B000OLTBL4|1.0|This is the biggest blunder of a movie based on a book I ever saw. My son and I have read the book. It doesn't follow the book in any way that one can appreciate. I had to give it one star because there isn't anything lower, but I would have given it half a star because the only thing appealing was the special effects and maybe the costumes. The acting was so bad you knew they were acting. Very sad. Don't waste you money!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon has done it again, after the genius of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel.\\"  Both of those series emphasized families of choice.  At one point in \\"Buffy,\\" her household consisted of Buffy, her sister, her best friend, and her best friend's lesbian lover, and a straight couple were regular visitors.  On \\"Angel,\\" the family kept changing, but the moody isolationist hero always had a family that helped to humanize him.  \\"Firefly\\" also explores this theme marvelously.  Whedon did indeed create an excellent Western in space, with a suspenseful plot, chase scenes, fights, the sexy confidence of Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and Zoe Washburn (Gina Torres) in action against the bad guys.  Except that the Firefly crew aren't exactly good guys.  Mal and Zoe were on the losing side of a rebellion against the central government's unification goal, and Mal's ship, Serenity, represents freedom to him; he may sometimes engage in illicit commerce, but he returned a stolen cargo when he learned it was medicine crucial to the inhabitants of the planet because it was the ethical choice.     In \\"Firefly,\\" Whedon has assembled a really unusual family of choice, but despite the disparate nature of the characters, they all come together for mutual support.  Even the the mercenary amoral Jayne (Adam Baldwin) comes around to making the right choices for the family instead of for his financial gain.  So the family.  Dad is Mal Reynolds, emotionally closed-off, effortlessly competent and sarcastic, a firm leader, someone whose quest for money and for freedom from the central government can be tempered when his family is threatened.  Mom is Inara (Morena Baccarin), a \\"Companion\\" (essentially, a very-high class escort, but, in this time, her profession is one of respectability).  She is the adult heart of \\"Firefly,\\" compassionate, loving, ethical, and empathetic.  The \\"kids\\" consist of: 1) the aforementioned mercenary Jayne, who manages to be a likable character despite his me-first attitude; 2) the oddest married couple I've seen on TV, the warrior Zoe (Mal's second-in-command) and her goofy, funny, but ace pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk); 3) the child's heart of the ship, the brilliant intuitive engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite) whose enthusiasm and love for life warms every character in the series (Mal can be at his gruffest, and Kaylee's kiss on the cheek and exclamation of \\"I love my captain!\\" will mellow him); 4) Kaylee's clueless love interest, the brilliant physician Simon Tam (Sean Maher) who gave up a highly successful career to rescue his even more brilliant younger sister River (Summer Glau) from government experimentation that has left her deeply disturbed, unpredictable, possibly dangerous, and at times, startlingly wise and lucid.  Finally, we have a grandfather, Shepherd Book (Ron Glass) who tries to impart ethical values to this diverse group, but who has a mysterious past hinted at by his knowledge of weaponry and occasional mentions of unShepardly actions.      Ultimately, however, the protector, defender, and home of the family is Serenity, the ship herself.  Serenity is as much a character as the humans, and each characters' developing relationship with each other through the episodes is paralleled with each character's relationship with the ship.  One of my  two favorite episodes, \\"Out of Gas,\\" shows Mal alone on the crippled ship having flashbacks to his first encounters with each of his crew members (each one very funny or witty) and then finally to his first sight of Serenity herself--utter, awe-filled love at first sight with Nathan Fillion's face lighting up in a way unique on this series.      Which brings me to the acting.  Each actor brings these characters completely to life and multi-dimensional.  Having seen Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, and Adam Baldwin play utterly different types of roles on \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel,\\" I can only admire their versatility and ability to fully inhabit each role.  Fillion's turn on \\"Buffy,\\" in particular (playing an appallingly creepy evil preacher) creates a brief sense of cognitive dissonance when watching him in one series soon after seeing him in the other, but within moments, the other role is completely forgotten due to his brilliant performances, which, as with the rest of the cast, don't seem like performances.  Each character is convincingly *real*, making the viewers care passionately about each one as well as the ship, and series itself.  The acting as well as the excellent writing and directing which we expect from a Whedon creation made viewers furious at the network's appalling treatment of the series (omitting episodes, cancelling it before the season was over), but their vocal defense of the series helped convince Universal Pictures to let Whedon write and direct a feature film, \\"Serenity\\" ([[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]]).  Which is also crucially worth seeing, but that's another day and another review.
B000MG1YC0|4.0|As a huge fan of Tristania, and inumerable other gothic metal bands, I must admit that I bought this album with high expectations. Admitedly, it is very good by most standards, but is also far more *shudder* 'pop-friendly' than will generally be apreciated by the average metal-head.<br /><br />Therefore, for those seeking something heavier, I certainly recommend some of Sirenia's earlier works, as well as those of Tristania- masterpeices all.<br /><br />But you should by no means overlook 'Nine Destinies and a Downfall', as it's still a very good record compared to most of the dribble out there these days.
B000IJ79UW|2.0|Be warned, Jor-el -- I am a \\"Superman: The Movie\\" purest to the Nth degree (I saw the original in its first theatrical run three times in 1978 and many, many more times on videotape).  <br /> <br />NOTE: If you thought \\"Superman Returns\\" was a better film than \\"The Movie\\", you may as well stop reading this review right here and now. There isn't a presence on earth that could convince me of that; and frankly, you don't know what you're talking about.   <br /> <br />The so-called \\"Original Theatrical Release\\" featured in the new 4-disc \\"The Movie\\" set may have cut out all those unnecessary \\"director's cut\\" scenes (present in 2000's 4-disc all-movies DVD set) -- for example, 1) an elongated council meeting between Jor-el and the scientists who don't believe his \\"outlandish\\" theory that Krypton will soon be destroyed and 2) after Superman's initial set of rescue sequences (starting off with the Lois Lane helicopter grab), he has an extraneous, melodramatic consultation with Jor-el in the Fortress of Solitude (with the exact same musical score from an earlier scene where Jor-el bids farewell to his infant son on Krypton; a technique which I despise, as if there wasn't enough dramatic music stock from John Williams' incredible score). <br /> <br />BUT... what the creators of this new DVD set didn't do was purge the HORRIBLE trumped-up \\"enhanced\\" sound effects from the 2000 DVD release (yes, I looked for a way to turn it off in some sort of audio feature, but you can't). And it's obvious almost immediately. A little background before my explanation: I regard the opening credit sequence of \\"The Movie\\" as one of the most heart-pulsatingly effective credit sequences I've ever seen (and heard) on film -- from that exquisite trumpet solo as Superman makes his first appearance in comic form (Action Comics) being read by a child, to the first-person \\"flight\\" over The Daily Planet globe, and on thru the bright-blue \\"whooshing\\" trails of the transparent credits as we travel to Krypton aided by Williams' never-to-be-matched march (simply amazing!). My problem with the \\"enhanced\\" sound effects -- and where I knew they STILL hadn't given me the ORIGINAL original theatrical release as advertised -- was in the \\"whooshing\\" credits sound from \\"ALEXANDER SALKIND PRESENTS\\" onward that all but drowns out Williams' exceptional score (where the original whooshes complemented the score). And much worse, we're not given that EXPLOSIVE WHOOSH sound at the first appearance of the Superman red-and-yellow shield -- now (as was in 2000) replaced by an over-whooshy (pardon my terms) sound with a clank at the end (the rest are over-whooshy sans clanks). And what about that \\"nails on chalkboard\\" crystal squeal after Krypton and its red sun have blown to smithereens or when young Clark first builds the Fortress? It's almost too much to bear (it actually hurts my ears now). <br /> <br />But this was all part of the 2000 sound effect enhancements; if you don't believe me (and you have a copy of it), compare the \\"whooshing\\" sound effects from either this DVD or the 2000 DVD (exact same enhanced sound effects I've noted in both) with the videotape version (you can still find it in some video stores).  <br /> <br />And speaking of ears, I couldn't believe them in 2000, and now I'm just pissed off about it in 2007. Will I return the DVD because of this \\"oversight\\"? Most likely. Will I send a complaint to Warner Bros.? It's on its way. Am I alone in my disgust? Highly doubt it (and I'd sure better NOT be).  <br /> <br />The extras are nice (the ony reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1), but so what? Please help in my campaign to get what we've been asking for -- a pure \\"Superman: The Movie\\" DVD release. I'm not going to settle for anything less, and neither should you.

B000PHX4VA|5.0|I can think of only one track that belonged here but isnt and that would be \\"When The World Is Running Down.\\"  But the extra attention that is given to early Police over previous attempts at a compilation make this collection far superior.

I never tire of hearing Stewert Copelands drumwork in the last 60 seconds of \\"Voices\\".  The inclusion of \\"Tea in the Sahara\\"  also bumps up the credibility.  Listening to this collection gives you every side of the Police, not just the softer radio version of the band as was the complaint of their \\"Evvery Breath\\" greatest hits.  Whoever compiled the songlist here did their homework.
1594200823|5.0|I recently finished reading The Omnivore's Dilemma.  I can't give enough praise to this book.  I thought it was one of the most insightful, thought-provoking books I've ever read.  I had heard Michael Pollan speak on NPR, and feared that his book was going to be a vegetarian screed or proselytizing manual.  But it was far, far from that.  There were so many new and astonishing observations Mr. Pollan had in the book, including debunking a lot of the myths about organic agriculture in the U.S. and the morality of being a vegetarian or vegan.  He reveals astounding and disturbing truths about the corn economy of U.S. agriculture and processed food industry, and its feedback loop that keeps farmers enslaved to lower and lower prices while committing more and more land to a single crop.  Truly eye-opening and scary stuff.<br /><br />I have always considered that human beings were evolved to be omnivores and that meat protein is part of a human's diet.  However, having seen animals being slaughtered and cleaned a few times, as part of social events we participated in, I am also one of those who would probably be mostly vegetarian if I had to kill and dress my own meat.  I don't object to others doing it, but I agree with Mr. Pollan entirely that animals should be raised humanely and killed as painlessly as possible, which is a far cry from most current practices.<br /><br />Why was this a great book?  It was well-written in an intellectual but entertaining style that showed Mr. Pollan's grasp of both his subject matter and the English language.  I liked his approach to his subject -- he bothered to take the time to experience his topics first-hand as well as doing book research.  The latter is amply documented by his bibliography.  He took on many topics that most people are either completely ignorant of or take for granted, and presented them in a new light:  the false economics and environmental degradation, and nutritional fallacy of a U.S. agriculture pillared on nothing but corn, the fallacy of corn-fed animal raising, the horrible conditions under which most animals are raised for food, including organically raised animals where the distinction from conventionally raised is more of a technicality than a real difference.  Don't believe in the words \\"free range\\" ever again.  He talks about the subtle yet eventually sweeping changes in agriculture that took place in the 20th century, leading to a system that is obviously unsustainable and will probably collapse within this century.  He contrasts typical agriculture with a unique sustainable farm in Virginia owned by the Salatin family.<br /><br />I loved his observations about mushroom hunting as they totally resonated with my own experiences and I found his observations about the act of hunting animals startling, fresh, and right on target.  What I loved most about this book was that it really opens your eyes and makes you think.  Many books are forgettable once you've closed the last page.  This one stays with you and I hope may even stimulate a groundswell for change in our food systems.<br /><br />My only criticism was not of the content but of the publisher's format.  The page layout, small size and choice of font made the book a bit tiring on the eyes to read.  If it's reprinted, they should think about something a little more reader-friendly.he fallacy of corn-fed animal raising, the horrible conditions under which most animals are raised for food, including organically raised animals where the distinction from conventionally raised is more of a technicality than a real difference.

B00001W9G0|4.0|The Way We Were is one of those classic love stories that I always knew I should see, but just never got around to it. Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford shine as a couple of polar opposites who are doing their best to make things work despite their differing political and economic views. Through it all, and despite their differences, their love for each other keeps them together year after year while they try to make their relationship work. The love story is beautiful, well told, and difficult not to enjoy. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who loves love stories.

B000J4QWMC|4.0|This hits the refresh button on the old groundbreaking '80s cop show, bringing it into the twenty-first century and making it much darker and grittier than its predecessor.  Gone is the music video flash, the neon colors, the cheesy comedy-sidekick informants like Izzy and Noogie, and the rock music over the gunfight scenes.  Gina has changed from a sassy sex-object brunette to a quietly lethal blonde.  Even the scale of the story has increased along with the level of technology used by the drug runners they're trying to shut down.  It's more dramatic thriller that plays like an unofficial sequel to [[ASIN:B00005JN2Z Collateral (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] than action movie, but it's good.

0375831002|4.0|From all the narrators invited to tell a story, the one in \\"The Book Thief\\" is one of the creepiest: Death itself. Australian writer Markus Zusak gives it voice, personality and even a heart, so that it can tell the story of a little girl who used to steal books to even score with life and death.<br /><br />\\"The Book Thief\\" fills in the gap of literature that is both for youngsters and adults - for better and for worse. It can please both demographics, but at the same time has to overcome prejudice from both. The book has wit and sensibility that recall contemporary successes such as Jonathan Safran Foer's \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" and the classic novels by Kurt Vonnegut, besides a black humor just like Lemony Snicket's series of \\"Unfortunate Events\\". At the same time, the poor infancy recalls Dickens - specially \\"Oliver Twist\\".<br /><br />Suzak has created a narrator that is both convincing and seducing the reader - and it is always trying to make the reader forget who it is. But the best of the narrative is the protagonist and her passion for books as a mean to defeat the adversities.<br /><br />\\"The Book Thief\\" is at its best when Death is not making soliloquies, and giving chance to the title character act. In these moments, Suzak create powerful images, such as a bonfire of books that reminds of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\".
B00065MDRW|5.0|Luis Mejia (son)- This album, being the debut of king crimson, stablish the genre of prog officially, checking that prog started with early influences of soft machine, the nice, procol harum and pink floyd. The first track 21st century schizoid man, shows the combination of rythms that prog would use through time, being a nice piece of a mix of rock and jazz, and the kind-of awkward voice of Greg Lake. the 2nd track I talk to the wind is one of the most famous of the band, being a nice soft song, that combines with Epitaph, which the lyrics are the best that king crimson have written. Later it comes the song Moonchild, which I first considerated an incomprehensible song, but later, after I heard a lot of king crimson material, I discovered that it's the song that characterize all their later works, because of the improvisation they use in the track. the last song In the court of the crimson king is my favorite, mainly because it combines a little bit of improvisation, good lyrics and rythms. It's a pitty that Greg Lake only lasted two albums, but this is the most perfect start for a band that would later be one of the most original bands of all time.

B000002IST|3.0|Luis Mejia (son) - at the time We Can't Dance was released, the remaining Genesis was already widely recognized in more commercial terms and in popular music of the 80's, but as the 80's passed by, Genesis took themselves five years to release We Can't Dance. Better than the too commercialy induced and vague Invisible Touch, We Can't Dance represents a much more relieable strike with a much more rock inclinnation. Still, as the rock aspect is dominant in the album, it still doesn't capture a correct sense of their musical direction, while Phil Collins' control over the past album was in result of huge commercial success, the same happened here but just with the same problem, Collins dominant and commercial control over Genesis resulted in a musical disaster, I wonder if he somewhat got tired of making pop on his solo albums and also making pop on Genesis, so the result here was much more rock induced genre, while a lot of pop material also can be seen in this album. Oddly enough, this resulted in Collins last album with Genesis before his departure, I never got clear why he left the band, pretty much because I'm not interested just happy because that fool went off, but I always thought that the only virtuos musician left in Genesis was Tony Banks, as he always seemed to display good natured compositions with a lot of cerebral and certain prog touches, but even more oddly he decided to stay with Rutherford and add a new singer, in this case it was Wilson, and I don't blame him for screwing up Genesis I blame more Collins and Rutherford. Anyway, in commercial terms We Can't Dance became a huge album, with such hits as the blues-like, rocker, enjoyable I Can't Dance, the sentimental, powerful No Son Of Mine, while being a good song is too much of a Phil Collins' song, and Jesus He Knows Me stays as a fast paced, catchy and melodic song but too much of an dull composition. Still, the album doesn't represent any comeback to progressive rock, so early fans still won't be pleased, but I can recommend the album for the ones who'd like to see Genesis last rock features, although there is one song which gets closely enough to the progressive rock aspect, some may result pleased with the ten minutes long Driving The Last Spike, is the song that I mostly recommend because, even when it itsn't a progressive rock song at all, its slight changing mellodies, its story telling, emotional content and its powerful performance may result comfortable for some of us early Genesis fans, but don't stay too high on hopes. Apart from the rock aspect, there are a couple of more songs which keep certain slight surprises and musical turns, best seen in songs like Dreaming While You Sleep, not too much of a mellodic or recognizeable song, but its sublime atmosphere leaves certain good traces on the song, while also having a certain level of intricate rythms, although I strongly recommend not to hear it while driving, Tell Me Why stays as the only song that gets closely of being a power ballad, although it may sound comfortable for some listeners, and Living Forever is mainly a pop song, not too much to say about it but its catchy and well crafted guitar performance by Rutherford will stay on your mind for a long while. Still, there is a lot of pop material in this album, and not so much of pop, more of adult contemporary efforts, the first ones seen on Genesis, but this effort is such an unspected change and such a dull one, making songs like the dull, foolish, vaguely romantic and boring Hold On My Heart, the fatidical but at least with more melody Since I Lost You, and the exagerate, poppy Fading Lights a real waste of time. All in all, its still interesting to see how Collins' last steps with Genesis were much more of rock steps with certain effort, but after hearing such things as Foxtrot, its impossible to be satisfied. And At last, their true final album Calling All Stations, being a paradox to its title was the most desperate act that the remains ofa band could ever reach to, I've never heard Calling All Stations with singer Ray Wilson, but what really bothers me is that they couldn't split with such dignity as they should've done in Duke.a band could ever reach to, I've never heard Calling All Stations with singer Ray Wilson, but what really bothers me is that they couldn't split with such dignity as they should've done in Duke.
0760750920|5.0|Nice little hardback edition of this wonderful classic. The print is fairly small, so you'll need a good pair of eyes or a good pair of glasses, but other than that a marvelous little book, very handsome indeed, and a great bargain.
B000002VEP|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Gaudi represented The Alan Parsons Project last studio album, and as you may notice my title line is taken from a fragment of the song Time, but I hope, some beautiful day, Woolfson and Parsons will get together again instead of giving us the long goodbye. Gaudi, being released in 1987, is certainly one of their best efforts, a beautiful and focused release for closing the project with a golden clip, its better than a lot of albums released in past works, and I still wonder if Alan Parsons made on purpose all of his musical career's structure, just for putting in his classic conceptual way all of his majestic experience and all of his styles and experimentations, as the concept album Gaudi, about the famous spanish architect Antonio Gaudi, is a difficult one to understand and review, 'cause it contains an inspiration on all of his past works, even the very first ones, but its still a beautiful, fantastic, dreamy release.<br /><br />Gaudi is an album where its seen the most greceful combinations of musical experience throughout Alan Parsons career, it seems that he suspected that the project was about to end, so instead of releasing heavy, experimental albums, he released a beautiful structure of nostalgic compositions, recalling their good times and also their bad times. As the album assumes a lot of inspirations and styles, its cohersion is a little bit duller than its past works, and apart of being such a reflective and hard to comprehend album, there is nothing bad with it. Gaudi contains a lot of musical twists and turns, I noticed the heavy inspirations on the albums Eye In The Sky, Vulture Culture, Stereotomy, Ammonia Avenue and even a little bit of I Robot, so it has a popcraft based structure, his unique way of making conceptual, cultural progressive rock, their later soft, undertaking, smooth and adult contempo inclinnations, and their latest synthesized sounds and experimentations, so the deal of originality is questioned, but still this is an album that just long time fans will understand and appreciate, the bad aspect of being a heavy or weird album for casual listeners is also present, so if you're a casual listener, you'll only understand this album after listening to all of their past works. The concept of Antonio Gaudi life and work is really heartful, too. It contains a set of nostalgic, sentimental, emotional, complex, delicate, focused, thoughtful, thematic, fierceful, mellow, smooth and dramatic moods.<br /><br />Among the tracks, this is another one of their shortest albums, apart from only possessing 7 tracks, but each one of them keeps a majestic emotion and fierceful compositions, with a delicate beauty, almost every track represents a must, but mainly the original, complex and nostalgic Standing On Higher Ground, which stays as a true effort and result into remembering their first styles, its a perfectly recognizable song that fits between I Robot and Ammonia Avenue, its the answer to many fans prayers, and among with the fierceful, strong and potent progressive rock style of La Sagrada Familia, sang by John Miles, its a slight recall into the style of Stereotomy; Too Late is another fantastic song, apart from being a dramatic song full of emotions its also a recall to the smooth style of Ammonia Avenue, its also sang by Lenny Zakatek; and the final one of the greatest songs in the album, Inside Looking Out, is one of their most heartful, inspirational, emotional and touchy ballad with the greatest lyrics in the whole album and a slight recall from Vulture Culture soft, pop style (but nothing synthesized=, its also sang by Eric Woolfson. The rest of the songs are also nice and touchy but not a highlight, like the minor hit Closer To Heaven, its a touchy ballad but just made too long, Money Talks is like the lost second part of I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You, also sang by John Miles, and the instrumental Paseo De Gracia is not much of a good instrumental, more like a mix of the songsStereotomy Two and Freudiana Two. Track pick: La Sagrada Familia, Too Late, Standing On Higher Ground, Inside Looking Out.<br /><br />The artists' performance stays very nice and enjoyable, hopefully not exagrated or out of tune, it kept some of the classic and most wonderful of TAPP singers, like Eric Woolfson, John Miles and Lenny Zakatek.<br /><br />In conclussion Gaudi is the last of The Alan Parsons Project solid albums, just followed up by the spin off Freudiana, is a focused and complex but cultural album, having a delicate dedication to we fans, possessing sounds and styles just comprehensible for the long time fans, and that may be the main reason of Gaudi's bad reviews or confused critics.nd Freudiana Two.

B000001ESN|5.0|wonderful C.D from Rush, they are the best musician in the world. <br /> <br />Do not miss the concert June 15, 2007 at the sound advice amphitheater in West Palm Beach . <br /> <br />
B000F5GO0A|5.0|indie melodies with gypsy european folk instruments!  these guys push the envelope to the edge... very very refreshing and lovely. <br /> <br />the music makes you want to spin around in 3/4 time like the dervishes... it makes brass band music sound good!  and even the accordion sounds great in the album. <br /> <br />the tunes are very catchy and melancholic and you won't be trying to tune it out of your head when you catch yourself singing it over and over again. <br /> <br />there is just one song which is a little strange because it has a casiotone (70s toy electronic keyboard)thingy going throughout the song, but i think they put it in to get that cheesy feeling which in a way is pretty daring but well spiced in an album that is completely filled with folk instruments.  <br /> <br />If you're an indie fan and like innovation and great tunes, this is a MUST BUY. <br /> <br />LOVELY!
