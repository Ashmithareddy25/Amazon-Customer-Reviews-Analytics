B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I've bought a few of this type of game but this is the first that I just couldn't put down!  Nice story line, amazing graphics and Totally Entertaining!  Worth more than the price I paid...  Try it, you won't be disappointed.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I love to read other people's versions of some story's so I figured why not give it a go. =)
B004X4QW42|4.0|I haven't seen a good new kung fu flick in a while and this one surely quenched that thirst. Good action, good story and it was pratically based on a true kung fu legend. Would've gave it 5 stars if it was brilliantly dubbed or made also in english. Worth the time though.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I have seen the movie and fell in love. So I figured I might as well read the book since they have a more details in books than in movies.
B0098G7AWS|5.0|This product deserves fifteen million stars for how well it was written and performed. I was thirteen the first time I saw it and it actually made me cry. Now every time I watch this movie I feel my eyes brimming with tears... Anyone who loves a romantic/comedy/mystery will adore this movie! So what are you waiting for? Watch the movie!!!!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Heard great things about this book..and so far so good. I'm a big reader so anything new or old that I haven't read I'll read.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It was very slow, found myself doing other things while it was playing, like dishes, laundry, picking up dog poop
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have read versions and have seen the movie. I love how they bring to life a world outside of our own. =)
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This is a fun game.  My granddaughter loves Uno and we play it together on the Kindle.  This one is a definite like.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very entertaining and a good challenge. It also teaches you to save your coins and to care for your horse.  Especially fun for little kids like my daughter.

B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|(Note: this review has been edited to reflect updates made to the text by the author. 4/2/13 KM).<br /><br />Everville: The First Pillar is an engaging, fast-paced fantasy story of parallel worlds, which is enriched by the  the beautiful scenic descriptions of its settings.  The protaganist Owen, a college freshman who finds himself transported to the alternate reality of Everville, is a likeable and realistic character who faces major challenges head-on in both realities.<br /><br /> However, the constant use of \\"Them,\\" and not \\"They,\\" where grammatically appropriate, to refer to the enemies in the tale is rather grating, and it is difficult to say whether Huff does this purposefully or not.<br /><br />Recommended for teens ready to move beyond Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, this novel will also appeal to fans of Terry Brooks' \\"Magic Kingdom of Landover\\" series.
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|Madeleine Peyroux has one of those voices that is subtle, sweet and doesn't need to ask for your attention by adding trills or drastic pitch changes through her tracks.  It's simple, tasteful and makes all of her music calming, soulful and beautiful.  This hasn't changed throughout her career.  What has changed is her musicality and what is behind her.  Personally I'm a fan of the \\"stripped down\\" Peyroux which is why I'm slightly disappointed here that there's no \\"Sweet Man\\" or \\"Weary Blues\\" type tracks here.  Nonetheless Madeleine does some fantastic, and subtle (a bit too much at times) takes on Ray Charles, Buddy Holly, and yes even Randy Newman here.<br /><br />I'd say if you're the casual Peyroux fan you may want to take pause before immediately buying the whole thing here.  While she delivers with her voice, there's just nothing I would consider \\"spectacular.\\"  But Peyroux has never been about flash, and this album is one that after the first few tracks I found myself quite entranced.  Her voice is just so pure.<br />So while this isn't my preferred instrumentation, her voice comes across beautifully especially on a couple tracks:<br /><br />\\"Guilty,\\" Madeleine brings her own tonality to this Randy Newman tune and gives it a slight country twist.  The song doesn't progress or plateau, but she's extraordinary here, with good range and vibrance.<br /><br />\\"Bye Bye Love,\\" Classic Everly Brothers song written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant...this is a swanky, bluesy version of the song and she does it more than justice.  My favorite instrumentation on the album and I really like that Peyroux comes up a little above her normal \\"low-key\\" nature here.<br /><br />Let's be honest, any music from Peyroux is good music, but I can't help but feel a little bit bittersweet here, as I want the stripped down woman who I know can deliver such power when a larger sound isn't thrown behind her.  I can only hope for the future...but for now more than this will do.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />If you're looking for more female vocalists in the same vein, I'd highly recommend (yes I am a bias amaricana listener):<br /><br />Crooked Still - Aoife O'Donovan has a beautiful voice that rivals any female vocalist right now, this low down old-time band is the best in the business.<br /><br />Gillian Welch - No intro needed, the queen of Americana.<br /><br />Allison Krauss - Bluegrass legend and maybe the purest voice of them all.<br /><br />Anne & Pete Sibley - Not as well known, but Anne Sibley has a classic voice, and she delivers every time.------------<br /><br />If you're looking for more female vocalists in the same vein, I'd highly recommend (yes I am a bias amaricana listener):<br /><br />Crooked Still - Aoife O'Donovan has a beautiful voice that rivals any female vocalist right now, this low down old-time band is the best in the business.<br /><br />Gillian Welch - No intro needed, the queen of Americana.<br /><br />Allison Krauss - Bluegrass legend and maybe the purest voice of them all.<br /><br />Anne & Pete Sibley - Not as well known, but Anne Sibley has a classic voice, and she delivers every time.
0670024813|5.0|another fine work from JD, explaining and illustrating, observing and comparing.  like he do.  cant go wrong with the diamond.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi's \\"new\\" album of collaborations mostly with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox (not always at the same time) brings us some actual tracks that we haven't heard before.  Surprisingly much of it is really worth it, although tons of Hendrix albums have come out, and this has possibly my favorite version of \\"Hear My Train a comin.\\"<br /><br />I will say that this album is probably more suited to the Hendrix fanatic than a \\"I'll listen to him when he comes up in the playlist\\" type person.  But if you haven't bought a \\"new\\" Hendrix album since \\"First Rays...\\" or my favorite posthumous release \\"South Saturn Delta\\" then this is definitely the one to get.  It's insanely hard to wade through his collection of albums especially on amazon, but this is Hendrix at his best with his later backing duo of Miles and Cox.<br /><br />I won't go through the album track by track as it seems they already have above, but the thing I love about Hendrix with Cox and Miles is that they provided such a powerful backing to his music that was different than Mitchell and Redding.  While not better or worse technically, I slightly prefer the sound, and while not all the tracks include this trio, many of them do here.  There slightly more \\"kick\\" to the drums and a little more \\"thump\\" to the bass.  Earth Blues is a prime example of this.  And \\"Hear my Train a Comin'\\" has so much energy and is so cohesive and engaging.<br /><br />I owe a lot to Hendrix, and although I'm only 29, stealing my father's Hendrix albums in 8th grade thankfully took me away from the Soundgarden/Nirvana thing and introduced me to the blues and classics.  I'm thankful that his legacy continues as other generations will be able to appreciate what he did for music.  Now if I could only find my tie-dye Hendrix shirt I haven't worn since I was 15.<br /><br />So while there isn't anything you've never heard here, this album helps pass Hendrix along to new generations, and in the end \\"new\\" Hendrix albums will only help music.  So don't hate on the guy, or his family.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />I just want to add that it seems there is a long debate with any artist who releases material after their passing.  Tupac, Frank Zappa, John Lennon etc etc...<br /><br />The sad part of this is that it takes away from the legacy of the artist and places more attention on those handling the artists work after they have died.  While this can't be ignored I can't help but think how Hendrix would be rolling in his grave right now upset that this has turned into such banter.<br /><br />I agree with much of what is stated in the other reviews, but Kramer is doing the best he can, and I can promise you he's not trying to make people angry.  He's trying to get the music of Hendrix out there, and that's what I think is great about this.<br /><br />I also think that anyone else in the position that Janie Hendrix is would make very similar choices and I really don't like the judgements made on Kramer and her.  Although cut and pasted etc etc, this is still the music of Hendrix, and it can be listened to enjoyably, and not dissected, unless of course that is your whole purpose in listening to the album.hate on the guy, or his family.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />I just want to add that it seems there is a long debate with any artist who releases material after their passing.

B00AMBH70S|2.0|poor direction, poor casting, tired story.<br /><br />good motorcycle chase.<br /><br />eleven more words recquired.  what idiot came up with that policy?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Haven't completed the season, but love the drama and humor.I've always enjoyed English history and the class difference they adhered to.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and it caused me to remember the sadness of the Iran Hostage crisis coverage, especially night line.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />I hadn't read a NS book in probably 10 years and I was in the mood for something &#34;fluffy&#34; and light so I downloaded this to my Kindle.  I wouldn't say that it's light due to the subject matter, but it was nice to get lost in this story.  Of course parts were a little cheesy and it was kind of predictable, but that was to be expected.  I could have done without the supernatural twist.... Other than that it was quite enjoyable.
B005R32L66|5.0|My daughter is in Afghanistan in the Air Force and this is truly one of the best ways for communicating with her. Thank you Skype!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|My cousins became addicted to this game immediately. It holds my interest for only a short time. I think it works well and have no complaints.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great way to spend some down time and do something fun. Silly as it may be.... I really do enjoy it!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I don't find it that intuitive. I had trouble choosing from my own songs to use as alarm. It's just OK for me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book deserves 6 stars it was simply amazing. Make me want to go out and find a man like Alex is!
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I fell asleep watching this movie, it wasn't what I had expected it to be. Not a memorable event at all. I guess not many movies are these days......
B001B0G5WA|5.0|An amazing album and one of my favorite Beach Boys records of all time. If you like the Beach Boys, this is a must have
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Perfect game to play if you are just killing time. I am not big on playing games, but this one helps to pass away the time.
B0033BD280|5.0|This is a quintacential jazz albulm, with a true feeling of a time forgotten. A staple in any record collection.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Purchased for my granddaughter, but I'll bet I've watched it more times than she has.  I love the animation and the humor.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|A classic rock album from a band with generations of devotated fans. You don't just love the beatles, you live them. A well produced record that appeals to all audiences.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Every movie library must have this item on the shelf. It brings back or it teaches how old times were ...romantic, passion--full, and men and women respected each other's values. They had values back then. :) Great movie.
B001H1OUWU|5.0|A fun albulm that always has something new, no matter how many times I've listened to it. If you are a jazz fan, new or old, you'll love this record.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I watched when it first came out. I bought it and watched it again and again. It haunts me. I laugh and cry the same, every time. An extraordinary movie! I am mesmerized. Great actors.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I received this CD for Christmas and tried playing through my computer, my Xbox, my CD Player (little boombox), and my car audio CD player - Tyler's vocals are very hard to hear and the mix isn't great - I wish it were better, but there seems to be a &#34;fuzz&#34; or blanket over everything - I compared it to Aerosmith &#34;ROCKS&#34; and &#34;Honkin' on Bobo&#34; and the mixes are so much better on their older stuff.<br /><br />It's a shame because a couple of songs stand out. They really sound good as a band, but I find it hard to overcome the poor mix. I don't know why they did it this way. Obviously it was their choice, or a producer's choice, at some point in the mixing process. I like to hear the singer first, and then the guitars, the bass, and the drums - so in an effort to be &#34;in your face&#34; they have just mussed it all up, in my humble opinion.
B000P6PVLC|5.0|What a movie, what a movie! Brilliance, excellence, laughs and tears, suspans, great actors! One of my top ten favorites!
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|It's a little difficult to check the items ordered and know how much was charged for them.  I still need more time using the system to be able to navigate it easily.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|I don't need to say more than Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in a thrilling detective movie. A must-have. One of the best and rare movies with these two mega-stars.
1449410243|5.0|Matt Inman's quirky sense of humor is on full display here. This is a 'don't miss' even if you're not a cat lover (or even just a tolerator).
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good love story. I hope to see the movie and hope it is as good as the book. Nicholas Sparks is a great author.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The entire main cast is a likable bunch.  Even the people set up as unlikable grumps have an admirable side.  There are the villains, of course.  But even those people that we cannot condone, we can empathize with.  Every character is human in their own way, and like every human being in life, every character is the hero of their own story.  They all have goals and ideals that they think are justified.  No matter the means they use to acheive their goals, even the villains believe in what they are doing, in some twisted way.<br /><br />The result is a chemistry that is rarely seen in a TV series.  Every character is like a chemical reagent.  Alone, every character is effective within their scope, but depending on the mixture and conditions, they can become far more potent or volatile.
1616614609|5.0|Netrunner takes a deck-building base game, adds in a splash of bluffing and removes the cash grab that Magic relies on, and comes out the other side with all the fun of a really competitive magic game with the bonus of non-parallel gameplay.<br /><br />The corporation side is presented with four factions to choose from, each with their own feel and style. Their nemesis, the runner, has three factions to choose from, and they are similarly flavored in their approaches. You're allowed a certain amount of crossover between factions on either side, which presents a unique challenge while deck building.<br /><br />I will give one downside to this game, and that is that it really needs a group of people each with their own sets. You can get away for a time with just a couple people playing the same core set (that style of play is supported straight out of the box), but it will quickly become obvious what you need to do to avoid the other player's strengths. It's still fun in this setup, but I don't know if you'd get the $40 retail value out of the game. Maybe you would.<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you have a FLGS nearby with any kind of magic population. Bring this over, demo a game for one or two of them, and watch how fast they get hooked.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Another great tormented love story from Jane Austen. Great cast and costumes and scenes. A story that tells us to go with our own feelings and not be counseled with advice that you will regret forever.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I'll explain the title of this first I suppose. My girlfriend had never seen Star Wars, and it took me 4 years to convince her to watch it with me, and when she did she actually kind of liked it. She also liked the 2009 Star Trek, and other than that she basically loathes science fiction. I started watching this on my own, and she came in and sat with me to watch an episode or two about halfway through the season, and when I got back from work the next day she'd already caught up. We watched a couple more that night and then when I got back the next day she'd finished the season. Enough of the other reviews cover the basis of the show so I won't go over that, but if you like cowboys, if you like outer space, or if you like to laugh then I cannot recommend this show enough.
B009X00E18|2.0|This case does not stand up very well.  I struggle constantly with keeping the stand securely tucked into place, often without success so most of the time I am unable to use it.  After just barely a month, I am ready to buy a new, different case kind.  I would not recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed the first person narrative, as well as the plot twists. Thought provoking story with strong human interest elements
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game!! I'm not a big game player but I wanted something entertaining like super Mario to pass the time....this is exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend it!!!!
B000000XB9|5.0|I love it. I was looking for an album that sounded like it did when it first came out. I've come to admire this group a lot and I wanted to give someone this CD. And Discovering how original this was, was just the perfect thing I was looking for. And this definitely meets expectations I had. And I would recommend this album to anyone. Great original sound quality and great songs are on here. Even ones I recognized by doing and not by name.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural season 8 is a pleasure. After season 7, which was a let down, it is refreshing to see Sam and Dean back in business.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the larger text. Love the listening option.  I love the Word of God.  COULD NOT ASK FOR A BETTER APP FOR THE BIBLE.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I started watching this on tv, but I missed the pilot. So far this has been a great series. Keeps you guessing
0385363133|5.0|This book leads you up to the final book in the trilogy. An explosion of love, lust, pain and two people finding themselves after they have found eachother.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great app fun to play....I am addicting to it its for all ages..... u can do tricks on d hover board
0385363141|5.0|I love it!  It is a book that will take you to a secret place. Be ready to be amazed!
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|Basically all the Xindi episodes. Pretty good if you can watch all of them.  Hard to follow if you don't.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie is so funny! I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it! I love it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|So I had heard this series was good but what I heard didn't even come close. Fantastic writing, wonderful characters and a magical world that draws you right in. This series is a good read for any fantasy fan
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was less than halfway and almost gave up but was encouraged to continue. The second half was definitely much better but here is my beef. The author is great at displaying quirks and interesting insights into people; almost too clever. There are too many times where the story spins it's web of cute little descriptions of people, places, modern customs, mores and those weird things that people do. But it does not always help the story, it just seems to be a vehicle for the author to show what great insight she has into other people. But I want 'story'.<br /><br />As for the story, it builds slowly but it was a bit obvious where it was going, toward a big &#34;twist&#34;. of course the second half was twisted again, multiple times. I cannot say I knew exactly how it would turn out, but it was tightly wound around a very few possibilities.<br /><br />Finally, and this is truly just a personal choice, I like to see some characters with some redeeming features. This story truly had no character that I would want to know personally. There was no one likable, not even remotely. I like a story where I can identify the hero and relate in some way.<br /><br />So I was a bit disappointed but it was certainly a clever story with great insights into the ways of our world, in some ways that are not very flattering.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|The book is excellent.  Well written.  A sad, but true story of survival against unsurmountable odds.  Not only<br />does it give us a first hand peek at history, it makes us appreciate our own lives, and reminds us that we must<br />be ever alert that it doesn't happen again.  Not a boring page.  I would recommend this book to anyone who<br />reads.  Period!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Had been lookin for a weather app for my kindle fire.  This works well.<br /><br />pros: local and regional weather reports/forecasts on demand and in the palm of your hand; no cost; 15 day forecast; weather radar<br /><br />cons: You have to spell your locations correctly - can't pick them off a map; advertising (they gotta pay for it somehow)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It's awesome that you can mix the sounds provided to create your perfect comforting white noise. Being an Oregonian the sound of rainfall is almost like a lullaby, during the few months that it isn't raining I've always slept terribly. Not anymore! LOVE THIS APP!
0399157565|1.0|What a disappointment! As a geologist who worked part time (undergrad) on  paleo project, I love books about dinosaurs. After reading the jacket blurb, I snatched this book off the shelf at my local library,happily anticipating wallowing in all things prehistoric. Well, forget that.<br /><br />This is a dreary mishmash of technical forensic terms, murky relationships, badly developed plot and poorly fleshed out characters. There wasn't a pleasant person in the entire book. Scarpetta is arrogant, self involved, better than everyone at everything and, I suspect, something of a Mary Sue character. The rest were cardboard cutouts  of assorted stereotypes.<br /><br />I ended up skimming the entire book (looking for the first mention of the paleontologist-which didn't happen until nearly the end.).  Since the murderer wasn't even introduced until the last 50 or so pages, even the mystery part was worthless.<br /><br />All in all, don't waste your time. I wish I hadn't.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like this game. I've been playing for a while now and haven't had to buy anything to play...
B0075XHLUM|1.0|This book I thought was sensational for me as a small business owner. It helped me with the underlying principles in my business. So I thought what better way to instill these practices than having it as a book on tape. I enjoy books on tape and know that the reader can make or break a book. This book was totally broken by the author's decision to read the book himself. It was actually hard to follow due to unpolished delivery. I almost ran off the road when he mispronounced raison d'etre as the ree-ayzon dee etre. I really wanted to listen to this over and over again and it is hard to get through it once.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Awesome movie.  Enjoyed the action and adventure and how Captain America came into being.  Like the twist of old and new.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is Awesome. My daughter got me playing this. Now I can't stop playing it. You'll be hooked FOREVER!!!!!!!!!
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|From the ads,I was expecting more of an adventure movie. It's not,  I guess it would be called a &#34;personal journey&#34;, not my kind of movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's pretty fun, surprised and happy you can play it without an internet connection. Wish there were a game that didn't rely on gems or some other hard to obtain form of currency though.
B000QCQ9O8|2.0|I feel this story was long and drawn out. It didn't hold my attention well. I kept having to force myself to read. The only reason I finished this story was out of respect for my fellow book club ladies....only to find out they were as disappointed about the book as I.
B007REV4T8|3.0|It is much edgier than previous Bond movies.....faster paced.  It seems to reflect changing tastes in todays world, but still:  Bond is Bond!

B008M0NDOK|1.0|This thing is so cheap it's sad. The \\"joysticks\\" are sticky and uncomfortable. Anyone used to Xbox or PS joysticks will feel handicapped. The buttons and triggers work about a third of the time. Also,  spamming the reload button until it works is so annoying.<br /><br />Gameloft does not offer a way to remap button abilities and in the case of Order and Chaos Online, you can't play the game without touching the screen anyways.<br /><br />Here's the worst bit: their newest Modern Combat game doesn't even support the controller. Clearly they've given up on their crappy product just as I have.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I read it in only 3 days which is  very good for me.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was introduced to The Game of Thrones one night while watching hbo. It was a re-run of the first episode of the first season. After the first opening scene I was completely hooked. Being a natural reader I immediately bought the e book for my kindle and found that the book was even better. Martin has created a great and believable historical fiction series, with no cliche or predictability. No one is safe and the stakes are enormous . I highly recommend this highly original epic to any readers. The setting is 10th-ish century Europe, but the story is contemporary, making it relatable and enthralling.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|have greatly enjoyed viewing these shows on roku on the amazon channel, and with amazon prime they are free.  best deal out there
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This is the first time we ordered a movie to watch this way, and we were pleased.  It was easy, and we had no problems with the movie.  This one isn't out on netflix yet, so this was great!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|quick and economical.  I like this mic so far.  Nothing fancy about it, and easy to use.  it was worth the investment.  don't forget to get the adapter if you using it w iphone
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I loved this game but it hasn't worked at all for over two weeks.  it throws me off after the title page so I will try to reinstall it.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|I loved season 2 as much as I did with Season 1. It's a remarkable feat that a very adult and very believable fantasy series can be as beautiful, epic, and just intriguing from the opening credits to the end credits of each episode. I received a free HD digital copy through Amazon because I bought the Blu-Ray season. Amazon.com is proving once again that it's Prime services will always be the better against the DRM filled and very much loathed by me iTunes. This season of Game of Thrones is probably the main reason I am never going to buy anything from iTunes ever again. It plays flawlessly on my Kindle Fire and my Playstation 3, and the best part to already owning it physically on Blu-Ray and digitally through streaming? I also can download to own each episode. Keep up the awesome work, Amazon. Game of Thrones, I will continue to purchase your seasons.
B003U51EE8|5.0|I missed this whole series and am watching on Amazon Prime....great show and don't know how I ever missed it.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Very enlightening book on people who tend to be more shy and introverted.  This is a good book for teachers, business, and families to read for a good understanding on how people interact.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|This LP is from the Jimi Hendrix collection. New in package, fast shipping, and very great sound quailty. The price is unmatched and you get it NEW, unlike the old copies on e-bay.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|very appropriate message about the earth, and conservation.  I watched it with my grandchildren, and then we discussed lots of the points about the show.  Definitely had a message!
0743297334|1.0|I received this book and half way through it a few pages where doubled. i didn't think much at the time, then i got toward the end and the whole last chapter was the same as the one before. i ordered it from amazon, new. I Trusted in you Amazon, i feel betrayed :(
B005LAIHZY|5.0|you can do and accomplish almost anything you put your mind too.....but don't turn your back on those that love you!
B0095P31L6|5.0|Yeah, there are lots of talking animals, and a few of them are even sort of cute. And yes, there are times when unbelievably crazy stuff rushes relentlessly at the viewer. Yet this skillfully crafted gem is clearly aimed at adult audiences, folk who can quickly catch its more nuanced themes and countless references to spaghetti westerns of the '60s and '70s. The talking animals are impressive stand-ins for humans with plenty of rough edges and potential for cruelty and cowardice, yes, and surprisingly courageous character and humility. This is one hell of a ride, from start to finish. It's a must-see.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have had Avast on my home computer for over a year now and it has saved me many times from Malware and Viruses.  When I saw that it was available on my Kindle Fire, I didnt hesitate to download the free App.  I feel confident that I am now protected.  I think you will be glad you did it- so go for it- its free!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|User friendly. Very good for desk calculator or office use. You can use every day. Easy use for even children.
1451695195|5.0|A little different take than I have usually heard of the afterlife.  Very interesting and peaceful to know these things.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|GREAT SHOW!  Give us MORE!!! Television should be fashioned from shows like this one!!  I cannot wait for the next episodes to come down the pike!
B00544L9EI|3.0|Eminem and Royce Da 5-9; collectively known as Bad Meets Evil, hence their duet from The Slim Shady LP; should’ve made an album back in 1999. Back then they were not only the best two rappers ever to emerge from the underground but nearly word-perfect to the point of lyrical flawlessness. Go back and listen to the song, or their classic Scary Movie, and tell me what rappers were better than those two.<br /><br />There’s a song on this CD, the title of which follows in the footsteps of that aforementioned Shady LP duet, Eminem haphazardly refers to as the “sequel” to Scary Movie. But that’s lyrical blasphemy. No verse on this album even comes close. As far as skills go, both rappers are mere shadows of their former selves; especially Eminem, who went from being then considerably better than Royce to now about equal.<br /><br />They are still two of the best rappers overground though, and there are a few truly impressive bars sprinkled here and there. Eminem’s David Carradine Die Hard rhyme scheme sounds like vintage Eminem and Royce’s “ass/bathroom” line is funny. In fact, that first track, Welcome 2 Hell, is one of the best songs; along with the ones with the best hooks, namely Lighters and A Kiss.<br /><br />Eminem’s singing on A Kiss, which comes with a minor yet surprising technical flaw; that it sounds a little muffled, perhaps because it was mixed with a little too much bass; is what makes the song good. The sample of a girl’s voice saying she wants a kiss adds to the concept. Lighters, as soon as it begins, with Bruno Mars singing the chorus, sounds like it belongs on a different album, but it’s a nice song.<br /><br />The Reunion is also a notable track. Not for its chorus, which is neither here nor there on the quality scale, but for the fact that Eminem makes a decent attempt to restrain the Recovery vocal delivery I hoped he’d stop using by now and because both rappers give the tiring speed-rapping a break. The concept of the song is sloppy; romantic heartbreak doesn’t go well with their reunion story; but it’s okay enough.<br /><br />The album, which, at nine full-length songs, is no more of an “EP” than Michael Jackson’s Thriller, ends with a Slaughterhouse song. And though Royce Da 5-9 should’ve come directly after Eminem, instead of after Crooked I; yes, the album has a few sequencing flaws; I guess that’s appropriate, assuming the next Shady Records release is a Slaughterhouse album.<br /><br />marcellee.comis sloppy; romantic heartbreak doesn’t go well with their reunion story; but it’s okay enough.<br /><br />The album, which, at nine full-length songs, is no more of an “EP” than Michael Jackson’s Thriller, ends with a Slaughterhouse song.

B00BB9PVQM|3.0|I become all insulted every time the bad guys pull one over on the cops.  Fool me once, shame on me.  If I see it coming right off the bat, the cops should too.  It just falls into utter silliness after a while.  I keep wanting it to be good, dang it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app! it wakes you up at the right time and lets you wake up to the sound of your music! its perfect!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. There are certain hours of the day when it will not load up. But I keep trying and eventually it will. That is anuisance when I'm playing one of the mini games where you have 24hours to do everything required.  I'm happy with this game.
1452113432|5.0|Great for an intro to French cooking! Bonus of starter and foundation recipes in the back of the book. Great purchase!
B000I9YWDO|1.0|Just not a very good movie, lousy plot, some funny moments, would not recommend this to anyone for any reason...
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I couldn't stop reading this one. It held my interest but kinda drug on alittle with the same issues over and over. She just needed to get over it and have her way with him already. He loves her for goodness sake.
B0054SMID0|4.0|This movie followed the book quite closely.  It was a good movie to watch on a quiet day.  I would recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Where do you find a man like this in real life? Wow! Hot, sexy, rich are three great characters &#34;but&#34; it's the rest of his personality that makes you want him for your own. What a man!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I am 34 and I consider myself a serious music fan. I love the music of the 60's/70's and have waited and waited for an album like this. Not only is the lead singer talented as hell, her band is strong. The vocals are a mixture of Janis and Aretha, and the backing is similar to Big Brother & The Holding Company. Now I have Alabama and Jake Bugg, Thank you Lord for answering my prayer! God music is here, Good Bye Katie Perry crap!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very fun game. My 5 year old little girl loves it she wouldbspend all day on it if I would let her....sometimes it doesn't load.
1400079144|5.0|Bought this for the voracious reader in the family. She loved it. She reads so many books that a few months after reading one she forgets what it was about and can read it again for the first time. She read &#34;The DaVinci Code&#34; and<br />&#34;Angels and Demons,&#34; and had to have this one too.
B00001NTXN|5.0|I already had the game!!! I had to buy it for my brothers birthday. Every house-hold should have one.....Its a classic.\
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app if you need to access the Bible on the go! It gives easy access to the whole Bible anywhere and anytime you need it.
B000I8G5B2|1.0|i wish i didnt spend $10 on the movie will think harder next time i buy a movie from yall
B008I43DYU|5.0|Yes - this is another must have on your kindle; I have one on my iPhone and it's such a great little tool. Every Kindle should have one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game cause my 5 year old can play it and so can I. But at this point of playing it. I feel there needs to be different levels. Easy medium hard. I find myself getting board before it gets moving fast. But other then that. Great game
B004NELBPC|5.0|This is a great app for anyone wanting up to date news on the go! This is an easy to read, easy to use app giving instant access to all your favorite sections quickly.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|After I said that I was done with rock star bios and autobios, I slipped. More often than not I've left the book disgusted and sick-feeling by the sheer sickness and level of selfish delusion these people run on. After AK's tenth or so relapse, you're not even halfway thru the book. It gets tiresome, because no matter how beloved, successful, and rich he became and remained, he seemed to have no problem disappearing for a week or two and scaring everyone who loved him to death. The worst part is that the band goes from pseudo-punk rebels to primadonna rock stars in a short amount of time, but he glosses over that it seems to me. Well-written, but left me feeling the way I usually do; I liked the celebrity before I knew too much about them.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I didn't really like this app - in fact I took it off pretty quickly. I didn't find it useful at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great story. It has everything that I wanted in a book, and I don't even read that much. Even if you don't read, you're going to love the hunger games.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is one of those games that keep you playing; it's very compelling [a little repetitive] but makes your mind work.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful, story line and great character actors, I could watch this everyday of the week, looking forward to season 4, thanks
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I purchased my lifeproof case directly from the company. My complaint is the same as many of you. I had my case for less than a year and never dropped my phone once. From normal use, the door cracked and i tried to contact the company at least a dozen times, if not more, over a two month period. Nobody got back to me so i found them on Facebook. At first, i politely inquired about my dilemma, several times. After a while, i got tired of someone telling me \\"someone will get back to you\\". It finally happened three months later. They told me to send back the piece with the cracked door and i would receive a replacement. I sent back the piece and FINALLY got the replacement part, only to be sent a bill for it. It was still under warranty.<br /><br /> I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM LIFEPROOF AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU!!!!<br /><br />I also found it amazing that when i turned on the surf channel to watch the Surfer Poll Awards last year, that the big sponsor for the show was, none other than, LIFEPROOF. WOW, really? Lifeproof can sponsor a huge surf awards show but cant get back to the customers who actually put them on the map? WOW! You guys rock! NOT!!<br /><br /> I REPEAT....DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!! YOU ARE BETTER OFF PUTTING YOUR PHONE IN A ZIP LOCK BAG!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Completely hooked after the first couple of pages.  It is poignant and funny at the same time.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and finished it over one weekend.  I liked the author, Sachi Parker. and found her npyj credible and sympathetic.  Ms. Parker's is not without a sense of irony, and In some instances, in describing her  unorthodox, if frequently negligient parents, she's flat out hillarious.<br /><br />I didn't find this Ms. MacLaine's daughter mean-spirited or vindictive, and as other reviewers have noted, she gives her mother credit where it's due.  One can't help but feel for the lonely little girl who often seemed little more than a footnote in her parents' lives.<br /><br />Beyond her father's creepiness, what I found most shocking was the amazing LACK of generosity shown by Ms. Maclaine and her husband toward their daugher.  Both of them lived lavishly, and though her father turned out to be a con man, her mother, easily a millionaire many times over, refused to pay for her daughter's college education, telling her after her high school graudation &#34;you're on your own&#34;.  The book is sad in some instances, funny and entertaining in others.  I recommend it highly.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Even after I removed it from my Kindle Fire, I still get messages to play it on Bubble Mania.  That is annoying!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so simple yet it is one of the most addictive games ever!! great time passer and fun for all ages! you should get this. no spending money whatsoever. flow bridges is great too.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very well written, and a &#34;fun&#34; read!  He makes it creepy enough to be real, and makes you think.  great!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Help is not readily available.  I have no idea of how  to move<br />from one book to another without going from page to page.<br />The help icon is of no help.  Every time I make an effort to seek<br />help or investigate how to use the tools, I feel as if I will be ask<br />to purchase a program.  Do not advertise the Bible as free  if<br />indeed it is not free.  I love the program. It is awesome and I<br />can barely wait for the next episode.(Footnote: after further<br />research on the web, I found what I needed.  The resource is<br />easy to use; the method of locating what is needed is not.)
B00127RAJY|1.0|Went to the thrift store with her other tapes, tried to give it away but no friends wanted it.  I am sure it would be great for someone just not me.  I like Zumba.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I love a lot of Tim Burton movies. I love this one too! It works great and I watch it often.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|Simply put:  If you liked the first season, you will like the second season as it has comparable level of entertainment.  The only things that's tough to get passed at times is the dialogue.<br /><br />I thought it was worth it.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|I am in aviation and still think this is one of the best movies ever!! And the quality now in blue ray adds to the viewing experience
B009NPKTN6|4.0|This is a fun movie if you were around in the 1980s to appreciate all the music featured. Tom Cruise is actually a credible rock god and can totally sing! I also though Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand were great together. Mary J. Blige is fantastic and Paul Giamatti and Catherine Zeta-Jones were great in their respective roles as slimy manager and uptight policital wife. This movie is so cheesy, but that's part of the appeal.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it, held my attention.  I was on edge and could not put my iPad down. Will recommend it and can not wait to see the movie.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|A was a little little disappointed considering it was rated so high when first written. A sad story of friendships
630471193X|4.0|John Travolta's \\"Phenomenon\\" from 1996 is similar to \\"[[ASIN:B004JM8X5E Powder]]\\", which came out some eight months earlier. Both films are about a gifted individual with unusual powers and the reactions of those around him. \\"Phenomenon\\" differs from \\"Powder\\" in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them.<br /><br />The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA).<br /><br />This is an interesting \\"What if?\\" story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character.<br /><br />I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy?<br /><br />Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.<br /><br />It goes without saying that \\"Phenomenon\\" is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought.<br /><br />Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises: If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a \\"realistic\\" ending. In short, they played it safe.<br /><br />Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest.<br /><br />The film runs 123 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: Bd it was going to hit me right in the face.

B008PO8PG4|5.0|Wonderful film of Lang Lang career from a young boy to the present time. His interpretation of chopin is amazing
B001675SOY|5.0|I was told this is soft music that I can play in the background when I'm on a dinner date. It was a bit shocking to listen to at first, mostly because I felt that the guitar work on this record was a little too hard, but by the time I was done listening to it I was pretty sure that I didn't have a wrinkle left on my body. However, now I love the record. I played it for my family, friends, their friends, everyone's pets and I take it hiking, camping, skiing, fishing and hunting. It's a good record if you like the outdoors or if you just like to chill in a dark basements with a bag of chicharones. \m/
B0002YJ29O|5.0|this is an amazing CD for anyone who enjoys all kinds of music. It has a great ending that will not disappoint
0316228532|5.0|I purchased this book for a Book Club selection.<br />The price was great and the quality of the book<br />is perfect (it was used).  I received it within a week<br />and was very happy with the service.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good.  It is rarely slow.  Very good graphics and movements appear very real.  Lots to keep you entertained for free.
B00AAX68HG|2.0|This game is a weird. Don't get this apps if you don't have children but if you have children, get it. The game get boring after a while and it makes u want to delete it.

B004XGN8W4|4.0|Got this due to seeing my roommates.  Wanted to see if it'd hold up to the hype he'd built it up to be.  All together its perfect for traveling with amazing sound and pic (can't even tell its 720 P).  Only complaint with the screen was a little bigger, but than it wouldn't be as compact.
B008LFY6NI|4.0|Love it reminds me of times using portable record player, paper AND paint in the 60s.  Hate that it won't work on my nexus 7
0143112724|5.0|It is The Elements of Style – but illustrated.<br /><br />It is just as invaluable – and illustrated.<br /><br />It had the same function - and it has mastered form.<br /><br />The illustrations are charming.  Yes, I used the word charming.<br /><br />If you like “The Elements of Style”, and you like charming illustrations, this is the book for you.<br /><br />See that comma after the double quote?  I think that is correct usage.<br /><br />If I wanted to know for sure, I could use this book.
B00335EQ0E|4.0|Classic and a bit strange but my 3 year old loves the movie and the product was in perfect condition.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was really excited to get an App of the Holy Bible. Love all the versions available for me although I love the KJV version.  I am now learning how to use the book marks and looking forward to adding notes on what touches my heart in the Bible as I read. I was very excited to find when I used the option of having the Bible read to me who was reading it. It's a person I found to be oh so very exciting to listen to when he read the Bible. The \\"tapes\\" were more than I felt I could afford. The Lord gave me the desire of my heart with him reading and so this was a very grand surprise for me. I would very much recommend this to Family and Friends.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good price and quick shipping........ ............ .. . . . . . . . . ..  . . . . .
B005HSL626|3.0|I saw this enjoyed and played by my Grand Children, the older ones!  It is a cute product. My Granddaughter with children of her own now is really up to date on what Apps are fun and work well. I let her give me tips on what to add in the way of Apps. This seemed simple enough even for me. :-) Hope I can do it on my own. :-)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the better sparks books. Great love story and story about courage.  It was such an easy read, I could not put it down. If you have been a sparks fan it's a definite read!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|This looks to be a very cute game! I was excited to get it because my older Grandchildren in their early 20's recommended it. Really felt good about taking their advice but then they had to come help me get started playing it. Still in a little dark about it but will get there! Lots of options and looks very exciting. Cute characters. She had a ball trying to help me out! She had no trouble putting it through it's paces. I'm not giving up on this one.
B003B96AOW|5.0|This Deadpool figure was created under the Marvel Select line and is beautiful and well painted and well equipped.<br /><br />He comes loaded withe weapons, katanas, machine gun, hand guns, sais, and of course a cool looking base. Now I will not compare him to the legends version, but he does LOOK better than legends while being slightly less flexible ONLY at theT joint area. The Marvel Select line is really for adults and makes a great display piece.<br /><br />My one problem is he has trouble standing on the base, at least mine does. But I make it work and eventually get him balanced.<br /><br />All in all, Deadpool is awesome, large, beutifully sculpted and painted and is a real winner. He's a 10 out of 10 and well worth the price point of $20 dollars.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good acting and scenery and it furthered the characters plot, which was needed in thus season. Best episode thus far of e season.
B009GED3HS|5.0|\\"How I Met Your Mother\\" we always make me laugh! Each character is funny in their own way. I don't think I'd be able to chose a favorite character.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Felt like I was on this journey with him. People spend a lifetime wanting to do what he did in 23 years. His passion to do what he wanted and to make sure he got there no matter what was amazing. The end just tore me up!!!! Amazing guy!!! Great movie!!! Everyone should see Into The Wild!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This is a great book, Mr. Dashner fills this book with adventure action mystery love and betrayal.  An all out great read, perfect for any science fiction lover, like me, especially if you enjoy The Hunger Games. Any age will like it but as the characters are teens I think it best fits our audience. Hope you will give it a try! Right after you finish the first book, Maze Runner, of course.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very good!  I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  I enjoyed watching it with Amazon Prime on my iPad!  Betsy
0316066524|5.0|Read this book. This is the best book I've ever read. By far. If you want to be cool. Read this.
B0038OY6DW|4.0|From the opening moment until the close this movie is just pure entertainment.  The action is the main draw but if you're paying attention the witty lines are enjoyable as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My wife stated that this is one of the best books she has ever read, and that she was disappointed that the movie did not follow along with the book. The way she raves about it, after I knock out a few more books I might have to take a look at it.
0143114085|2.0|I read this book as part of a book club read.  After about the third or fourth chapter I wanted to put the book down I kept hoping that it would get better.  The main character was absurdly docile and a literal door mat for someone in the psychology sciences background. Near the end she inexplicably grows a sense of self-worth after enormous degradation.  I just wasn't believable to me - the characters or the plot.
0142429112|5.0|Discovery of Witches is a remarkable book.  I listed to the audiobook in my car, during my commute.  Jennifer Ikeda is simply amazing.  The way she does the different accents and voices, leaves me amazed!  I wish I knew how she does it!  I simply love listening to her, which I think enhanced my love of this book.<br />I know some audiobooks, the reader is very dull or can be annoying, but she is just wonderful!
B005HI4LLY|5.0|I haven't seen a movie this funny in a long time. Definately great for multiple viewings. You won't be disappointed!
B0002IQNAG|4.0|Is anybody there? Great movie less about zombies, more about the human spirit or the erosion of it. A lot of great dialogue, Romero's take on humanity is real, and frightening.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app looks and works great on my KFHD. It's easy to use- I can't think of anything that would make it better for me.
B0018Q4DTY|5.0|Very little sampling, Big Boi and Dre did some of the production. Listened to it back in college and liked it, listen to it now and love it.
B004M3GDI4|5.0|This is the secong unit I have purchased; good variable beam; light weight, good battery duration, easily adjustable. Highly recommend it.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|Within 1 month of purchasing this watch as a Christmas present for my husband, he has had to mail it in because it stopped working. He has worn it just about every day and after wearing it for several days in a row without taking it off, it still would not work. We have mailed it in for repair about a month ago, and still have not heard back. DO NOT BUY!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely think the best app I have downloaded yet.  I read all the time.  I have a Kindle Fire that I take everywhere with me.  Sometimes, at my 10 minute breaks, I waste a few minutes turning on the Kindle to read.  After getting the app for the phone, I don't waste any precious time.  I can start reading immediately. It sync's to the last page that I have read on my Fire, pages turn with no problems, doesn't drain the battery and shuts down fast.  I have read the reviews on it and most are negative.  I haven't had any problems whatsoever with mine.  Well, unless you want to blame it on the Kindle for Android that it hasn't purchased the next book.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This app makes it fairly easy for me to view my yahoo mail. It does get a little difficult to figure out how to move from one folder to the next, but overall, the view and functionality is pretty good.
0312330537|5.0|How this book is not a bestseller is beyond me. Great stories with rich and lovable characters and an awesome command of our language. One of my top 5 ever! Highly recommended!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Everything Rock knows about the guitar after 1970 came from his psychedelic twisting of what the instrument could do.  I paid homage to Hendrix with a portrait called Purple Haze on the anniversary of his passing recently.  You can see it at [...] and tell me how the voodoo child’s music has influenced you!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have probably only done this DVD about 4 times at this point, but I am already obsessed with it. I am a moderate gym-goer trying to amp up my routine a bit due to my upcoming wedding. This is a great, fast at home workout that gets you seriously sweating and pushes you to the limit -- amazing considering how short it is. This is my first Jillian Michaels product and I am already going to buy more of her DVDs. My only complaint is that when you first put the DVD in, it takes a while to get to the actual exercising, and there is no way to fastforward through the filler in the beginning. Since I generally do the DVD in the morning, I now pop it in, go brush my teeth, put on my shoes, get some water, etc, and it is ready to go by the time I am back in the room. I would recommend this to anyone, from novice to experienced, who wants the flexibility and ease of a great at home workout.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Cant get enough! I have to pry myself from the tv so I dont watch a whole season in one sitting. Its addictive. Cant wait to see what happens next. So glad mary finally came around! Poor edith my goodness.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This was the first thing that we streamed from our new Wi-Fi enabled Sony Blu-Ray player, and were pleased that we were able to view it with the credit on Amazon Prime that we received from the Amazon purchase.  We've been watching the James Bond movies since they all came out, and this one didn't disappoint.  We hadn't been sure that Daniel Craig was as good as most of the prior Bonds, but he was great, and the production was too!
B004XUMMFE|1.0|I have a hearing problem and when watching Firefly, the captions were there in episode number 1, but missing from all other episodes.  I have seen this series before and the captions are in all episodes so I wonder why they are missing when viewing online.  The one star rating is for this comment only.  Normally I would judge Firefly as a 5 star show.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Friends have been telling us how great this series is, but when we tried to listen to the current Season 3 TV showings, we were completely lost.  First, we bought the 1st season (from Amazon), then couldn't wait to continue watching the whole series by catching up quickly by viewing it on Amazon Prime.  The characters are so interesting, the history compelling, and the costumes, period settings, clothing, vehicles and setting is so realistic.  We can't wait to continue by finding a way to view Season 3 without delay!<br />We're very glad that we now can stream this from the Internet, on my Wi-Fi connection to the new Sony blu-ray player, also purchased from Amazon.  It's all new technology to us, and we're excited to join this experience.  We've only had the streaming ability for 3 weeks, but it will become a huge part of our viewing from now on!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought it for Journey, and you should too.  I think everyone should play this refreshing game at least once, if anything to realize how games can be simple, subtle and yet strongly emotional.<br /><br />Describing this game would be a disservice to anyone who hasn't played it.  So...play Journey, you won't regret it.<br /><br />Flower and Flow are good as well, but not quite on the same level.
0547848412|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book and that is the right order as the book has much more detail that the movie did not include, maybe just as well. The authors attention to detail is amazing and he keeps you in such an exciting state of mind in wondering what could poosibly happen next, that I could not put the book down for long before getting back to the story.<br />Especially loved the ending.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I learned so much about the Apple brand and about how it was created.  Steve Jobs was a brilliant man and I enjoy knowing how the products I love came to be.  Great read.  Very sad that he is gone.

B00AW8VUDG|5.0|Krokus has done it yet again. Putting their own twist on the early AC/DC and Bad Company sound, they have come up with another blistering batch of boogie rock that ups the ante from their last effort \\"Hoodoo\\" even more.<br /><br />The opener \\"Hallelujah Rock N' Roll\\" is a great track to launch the album. \\"Yellow Mary\\" and \\"Rattlesnake Rumble\\" are two other classics. They slow it down a bit for a cover of \\"Help\\" and the blues influenced title track. A few tracks are so-so, as \\"Better Than Sex\\" is pretty close to being just filler. But even the weaker tracks are more than tolerable, and the strong ones rock out with a melody you'll be humming all day. This band shows absolutely no sign of slowing down, and if you liked their last effort, give this a spin. It's just as good, if not a bit better.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I read this book as a suggestion from my teacher for a class paper. I didn't expect to like it because it's not like the books I normally read. I was surprised to find that it was actually quite interesting. It helped me to learn a lot about myself and the way I respond to certain situations. I, in my own right, am an introvert. This book let me know that I am not alone in the way I feel and should consider being an introvert more of a gift. It made me think of the people I associate with and whether or not they are introverted or extroverted. It also explained to me why I feel tired after having to deal with people for an extended period of time.
0553801473|3.0|I couldn't wait to read this book and I don't think I could have been more disappointed with it after I did.  Hopefully the writer will salvage the story in the next one.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Best show ever. Have watch series 6 times and it still pulls me in.  Best sound effects ans story twists ever written.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|A well written, quirky and insightful glance into the minds of somewhat disfunctional individuals.  It was warm and sincere and I loved the characters.  It certainly was a read I'd recommend to all.
1560100842|4.0|It is a lovely book for beginners that is full of examples but it contains limited explanations.  My daughter is enjoying it!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Yes, clearly, it was time to retire this series of movies.  We already knew all the &#34;tricks&#34; from the previous movies, but it was entertaining just the same.
0345472322|5.0|This is one of the best psychology books ever written.  It is an amazing and effective self-help and other-help book.  Everyone should read this book and its ideas should be required training for schools at all levels.  If you want to make your life, your children's lives, your student's live's better, then get this book.<br /><br />Very, very, highly recommended.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I can not wait to read the next book from Travis' point of veiw. I think it will be very interesting.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is an easy read. Somewhat technical and not sure about the accuracy of some of the technical aspects but well put together. The book is a good example of problem solving and offers one problem after another perhaps formulaic in this aspect. The very ending may be a little weak, but the remainder of the book holds your interest thoughout.

B005COO1X6|5.0|If you like King (Which I do!) then you'll like this story.  It brings back memories of his novel &#34;From A Buick 8&#34;.  It has all the classic elements of King's style.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|It was exactly what I wanted, I would recommend this to anyone who likes Paul Simon's music  It is definitely the best album

B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I watch a lot of scary movies, usually a dumb movie I can relax and don't think about it much, but this movie was scary.  I think the fact that it was so dark throughout the two houses was what freaked me out the most. I wish it was a bit longer, develop more the characters, hopefully a part 2 will be filmed.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|This blu ray is excellent.<br /><br />The sound and images are great.<br /><br />I wish there were 30 songs at least<br /><br />I recommend the concert and the seller
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Bonamassa is pretty amazing.  This is his 13 studio album in 12 years (not counting his many side projects), and almost all of those albums are good to great in quality.  \\"Daylight\\" is no exception as Joe once again proves that he is the current king of contemporary blues.  It probably helps that he only wrote four tracks on this one which makes \\"Daylight\\" one of the more cover heavy albums of his career.  The covers he chooses however, are not obvious ones which allow Joe to put his own stamp on tracks that may not be that well known outside of blues aficionados.  There is not a bad track on this one.  Joe's guitar is smoking as usual, and his singing just keeps getting better.  This is yet another great Bonamassa album and certainly worth picking up even if you have all of his other stuff.
B003ELOQD4|2.0|When I open the blu ray, it starts immediately in last song.<br /><br />The sound was poor and the images not so good.

B001PJ5UIM|5.0|Most people can't separate the Fagen from the Beckler in Steely Dan. If you listen long enough you start to sort the Kid Charlemagne's (drug dealer on the down slope of his career=Beckler) from the Home At Last's (Homer's Odyssey in jazzy minor key=Fagen) but, like a Reese's PB cup, they can't be completely unmingled in \\"Dan\\" form. Which is why Fagen's solo stuff is not only good on its own merits but also compelling for what it lacks. You get to learn and appreciate what Beckler brings to Steely by his absence and Fagen gets to take his sincere love of the fantastic out for long leisurely drives. Drives that would be cut short by drunken crashes, doomed underage hitchhikers, or dying hopeless addicts with tender stories of failure and loss if Beckler were co-piloting. Kamakiriad does have that uniquely Dan trait of being both old-fashioned and ahead of it's time without being ever fully with it (no matter when you're listening to it) and you'll certainly get your USDA allowance of wistful from tracks like \\"on the dunes\\". But there's bouncy unfettered sci-fi joy in \\"Snowbound\\" and \\"Tomorrow's Girls\\"  that is pleasingly un-Dan. I was tempted to give the album 4 stars as it's a bit light in the loafers compared to Fagen's amazing first solo album (\\"Nightfly\\") but that might discourage folks from giving it a listen. It's not #2, it's just more of an album for light hearted snowdays.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Very useful application.  Use this to download videos on my kindle to watch later without wifi. Both videos and mp3 play properly on kindle haven't had any issues. Its easy to use and convenient.  With several different download options. I say best you tube downloader.
B00B1CGD5M|2.0|Loved Steelbath, Chainheart(My All Time Favorite), Predators Portrait (Second), a few songs off the other albums and Panic Broadcast I considered their comeback album. Wichers was the most important member of the band because of him being at the helm of the songwriting process. Also Wichers and Frenning were the nucleus of the guitar assault for all those years. Even though TPB didn't have Frenning, Wichers gave it enough kick in the tail to make it a great record, even the slower material.<br /><br />This album lacks soul, depth, structure, and just sounds like they took 20 songs, meshed them together and said hey lets release this now. I can only think of a few (very few) songs that even caught my attention that I could even listen all the way through. It mostly sounds like one big song put together, having no real distinct difference between one and the next. Also it's IMO overly melodic and sounds way to forced. And there are also way to many ballads, as well as WAY to much music. Ten songs are usually the norm, and people get exhausted after all this material. So I guess i'm the only one with guts enough to say the &#34;real&#34; Soilwork is gone, just to many lineup changes and to much of the material is just mundane and boring. So hang me now I guess. I'll stick to the good ole days. Also check out Frennings Fifty Grand Suicide (band), good stuff there. Hopefully Wichers records some new material as well. This is just a mess of sound. Period. Later.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great app. It is accurate detailed and convenient to use with a good interface. Im always checking it before heading out. ツ
0062014536|3.0|There was great action and great pace and it really moved along well. What was missing however was the passion and romance and dare i say love?<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW:<br /><br />I was disappointed in the lack of chemistry between Lena and Julian. He was like lump on a log that Lena curled up with from time to time. I'd actually have appreciated it if he were the one having a hard time loving her due to his inexperience with love. But he just ended up being a character of convenience for me. Just for the sake of having a love triangle. His work towards becoming one of the group and his struggle with acclimating with the Wilds was far more compelling. I was also a bit disappointed that his prior status with the 'zombies' wasn't exploited at all in this book.<br /><br />I was also really disappointed with Lena's interactions with her mom. After all of that buildup and it just turned out to be ho hum.<br /><br />It just all seemed to be lacking the passion behind the love which was supposed to be what they were fighting for. Although I suppose at some point in this book the focus changed from Love to Freedom.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a good show, I highly recomend it! You become very involved with the shows characters.You will love it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Have always loved Nicholas Sparks books. This is no exception. Grabs your interest early and keeps you involved. Quick and interesting read.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|This was a great story that kept me riveted. At times I couldn't put the book down. The story line kept you guessing as it twisted until the end. Definitely recommend!
0440246008|4.0|Perhaps you shouldn't start reading the Reacher series by Lee Child. One page leads to another. One chapter to another and one book to the many Reacher books. You'll miss out on a few of those erudite tomes you promised yourself to read before shuffling off this mortal coil. But, on the other hand, you'll be able to say how much fun you had on the ride. Indulge yourself.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Really enjoyable sci-fi movie with a well-developed story, believable characters you can relate to, impressive special effects, and very good acting.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|The DVD I received was a library rental copy, and also had a lot of damage to the disc. There were parts of the movie that the DVD player was unable to read, and there were a LOT of visible scratches to the back of the disc.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it! Such a great series. I was able to purchase/watch it right away! Can't get much better then that. Quality was good, no skipping or &#34;buffering&#34;
B008Y5OWMK|2.0|This review is in reference to the 3 hour, 45 minute version of the notorious box office bomb that sunk United Artists into oblivion.  I've wanted to see this film for many years, but never got the chance.  Finally saw a version of the film on TCM.  Yes, the film is long.  It meanders all over the place, trying to tell the story of the actual conflict between rich and poor ranchers in 1890's Wyoming.  It fails miserably to keep our interest.  Actors are walking or running around like a &#34;Chinese Fire Drill&#34;.  Dialogue that is hard to understand of oblivious. The fault is clearly on director Michael Cimino hands. His attention to detail turned into a crutch for the film. The film could have been edited down to 2 hours.  But even that adjustment wouldn't have save this film.  Pretty sad, because the film had potential. It's far from being the worst movie of all time, but it's frustrating to know the film could have been so much better than it was.
1451627297|5.0|I just finished reading Stephen King's 11/22/63, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  At 800+ pages, I somewhat expected it to be a long laborious read.  In fact, it was anything but.  Certain reviewers have panned it for being overly long and containing far too much description, but I found it to be a light and airy read, albeit on a literally mind-boggling subject.  I couldn't put this book down and I ended up finishing it in no time.<br /><br />11/22/63 is a thoroughly entertaining novel about time travel and the basic premise is revealed early on in the narrative.  The story begins in the present day with protagonist Jake Epping a thirty-something year old remedial English teacher.  He befriends Al Templeton, who owns a diner and is dying of cancer.  Al has a terrible secret to unload before he dies and he unloads it on Jake, but he exacts a promise from Jake in return.  In the basement of Al's diner is a portal to the past, specifically 1958, and Al presses upon Jake the task of passing through this \\"rabbit-hole\\" and literally changing history by preventing the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  (The rationale is that if JFK lives to enter a second term in office, the Vietnam War would be nipped in the bud and never allowed to escalate under LBJ, thereby saving thousands upon thousands of American lives.)  Of course, since the portal only enters into 1958, it will be necessary for Jake to live through five years worth of the past to bring him up to the time of the assassination.  Jake, who has taken on the alias of George Amberson, spends much of these five years doing mundane things like teaching high school, forging friendships and, basically, living in the past, and part of the charm of the story is the description of life in the 1950s, a time of no cell phones, cheap gas, youthful innocence and trust among your fellow man.<br /><br />There is an intriguing subplot where Jake/George in 1958 changes the fate of one of his 2011 elderly remedial students whose young family had been killed by their drunken father in a murderous rage.  But by story's end when Jake contemplates if this was necesssarily a good thing, he has his doubts.<br /><br />Along the way Jake/George meets his love interest, Sadie, and the description of their relationship constitutes the most poignant prose I've encountered in a Stephen King book.  His love for her is so sincere that, even after a hideous injury, \\"If there is love, smallpox scars are as pretty as dimples.\\"  Sadie plays a major role in the final outcome of George's mission.<br /><br />Apart from the love story, George spends his time stalking Lee Harvey Oswald to make absolutely certain that he and he alone was responsible for JFK's death.  If not, then stopping Oswald may not have the intended effect.  (He entered 1958 aware of the JFK assassination, but since even today that event is shrouded in mystery and conspiracy theories, Jake/George did not have the benefit of this definitive knowledge at his disposal.)<br /><br />The creepy aspect of this book involves the interweaving into the narrative of real-life characters who in the story meet fates that are different from those with which we are all too familiar.  There is a high \\"creepiness\\" quotient in the passages where George is observing or even speaking with Lee and Marina Oswald as well as John and Jackie Kennedy.<br /><br />One of the more interesting and certainly thought-provoking themes of the book concerns the \\"Butterfly Effect,\\" the notion that even the most minute of events can have unanticipated, seemingly unrelated  - and sometimes earth-shaking - repurcussions far into the future.  That fascinating notion is certainly food for thought.  The book teaches us in chilling fashion that perhaps we should leave well enough alone and NOT tamper with fate.  \\"Peek not through a keyhole, lest ye be vexed.\\"  Chilling.  Life is fragile and it can turn on a dime.  A sobering thought.<br /><br />By story's end, when Jakeclimbs back through the rabbit hole into 2011, he is ruminating about the repurcussions and ramifications of his act.  When one stops to think about the innumerable \\"strings\\" attached to one's actions, your imagination can cause you to spin off into infinite \\"what-ifs.\\"<br /><br />I have read many if not all of Stephen King's books.  I have enjoyed most of them but some were simply too....bizarre....for my tastes.  11/22/63 proves Mr. King to be a master of the imaginative, asking you to suspend belief but without resorting to his usual bogeymen.  This is a thinking (wo)man's novel.<br /><br />I have found Mr. King's later works (e.g Bag of Bones, Duma Key) to show a maturity and sensitivity that were lacking in his earlier works, and 11/22/63 is no exception.<br /><br />The ending of this story - involving an 80-year-old Sadie and a 30-year-old Jake - will touch your heart.<br /><br />I won't give the conclusion away but rest assured your mind WILL be boggled, and if you - like me - love a book that really gives you something to ponder, you will not be disappointed.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Jeremy Renner does a good job as Bourne. His hand to hand fighting is crisp and credible; the story line good.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|Love the series.  Purchased set in November 2012.  Just had time to watch and found that the last 7 minutes of the first disc cannot be accessed.  Took to video store to have resurfaced but made no difference.  Very disappointed.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|A lot of unbelievable action, but a little over the top; otherwise, for action fans, better than most. Happy viewing
B00B935SUY|5.0|I didn't want it to end. Interesting and fun to watch... Great job of capturing an era (that I grew up in)... Long live rock!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Good animation; good story; good interaction between the bear and Wahlberg. I liked it for creativity, but it could have been written stronger, for more funny.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and the acting of Mr. Hopkins, Ms. Mirren, and the rest of the fine cast. Enjoyed the behind scenes of the making of Psycho.
0316232955|5.0|Great book, love the sarcastic humor, oh and the shout out to Racheal Maddow haha! Can't wait for the movie!
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|There must be a moral somewhere... ? I think they missed on the ending. Kept waiting for the reason I rented the movie. VERY Good acting, but not sure where it was placed.
1932100660|5.0|Heard of the China Study from the film 'Forks Over Knives' (recommended) and wanted more info. Everyone who values their health should read this book. Impressive to say the least!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this with my eight year old, and we both loved it! We laughed together. We cried together. We both couldn't wait to see &#34;what happens next&#34;. Wonder opened up great conversations on kindness, morals, strength, and determination. My daughter now wants me to find another book &#34;just as good as this one&#34;--for us to read next. I have a feeling that I am going to have a hard time finding another that is comparable!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This novel provokes great discussion as if deals with very difficult topic. Does a person have the right to decide when to end his or her life? What is the obligation of loved ones? The topic is serious and the story great!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Item took forever to get here( a little over 7 days) but it got here in one piece and as described.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I enjoy DeMille' s dry humor sprinkled throughput a story about real life unpleasantries. He did a great job creating the tension of having to do a nasty job in an alien culture. Only Corey and Kate could survive; in spite of or maybe, because of, Corey's paranoia.  This story seems current to our times, though I suspect it covers timeless issues for some.<br />  John Corey stories are action packed, right wins, and there is a perverted humor that somewhat justifies his perspective of honor.  I enjoy the unusual twists his stories take. The Panther was no exception.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I watched this movie on bus ride to NYC.  This movie has been the best suspense I've seen in a long time.  Ben Affleck was awesome as usual, but i really like John Goodman (I'm a fan.)  Argo made my 3 and half hour bus ride go by in a flash.  I definitely would recommend watching Argo.  I can see why this movie won all of the awards it did.
B0056FMNYA|5.0|The quality of this holster is good. It holds the camera well on your hip and it is a very practical solution.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I watched this movie on my way home NYC on a bus.  Skyfall made my 3 and half hour trip fly by.  I loved Adele's them song.  It was awesome and fit the movie perfectly.  Daniel Craig was his usual Bond self.  Overall, for someone that doesn't follow the James Bond movies faithfully, this movie was very entertaining.  It made me want to go back and watch the old Bond movies.  You can still see some of the classic James Bond cinematography in this new movie.  It was great.  I definitely recommend watching this movie.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|Great sound track. Funny moments glimpse into the character's mind with enjoyable quirkiness.  A good coming of age flashback story.

0143121421|5.0|The Spy Who Came In from the Cold is the book that made John Le Carré, and deservedly so: it's a small gem of espionage writing, taut but also authentic. It well deserves Publishers Weekly's judgment as \\"the best spy novel of all time\\" and Time magazine's inclusion on its list of the best 100 books ever written.<br /><br />The plot, essentially a long con, has become a classic: Alec Leamas, the burnt-out shell of a protagonist, embarks on an undercover operation to discredit a high official in the East German intelligence service. The Circus - Leamas' supervisors in a thinly-disguised MI-6 - twists the op into something Leamas can't anticipate and that thrusts him into a much more complex situation than they'd ever discussed with him.<br /><br />The tradecraft and mechanics are as realistic as the censors would allow; at the time of this book's release, David Cornwell was an MI-6 officer writing under an assumed name (Le Carré; he subsequently resigned from the service after this novel took off). The bleak portrait of a Berlin still scarred by war and newly traumatized by the Wall is atmospheric and spot-on. It's impossible to see this world in sunlight, far less in color.<br /><br />Unlike the contemporaneous Bond and Matt Helm series, SWCIFTC is set in a universe in which everything is a shade of gray, the \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" are nearly equally morally bankrupt, and \\"the game\\" has overtaken any ideals either side may ever have had. Leamas is as far from James Bond as you can imagine. Unlike Bond, this one feels real to its bones.<br /><br />I had reason to read this book again after a very, very long time. I was surprised at how short it is - just two hundred pages in a mass-market paperback - and how tight the writing is. I also realized that you have to be a certain age to fully understand Leamas and feel for his plight. I was quite young when I first read this, and sadly enough didn't connect with its grim and weary world and the broken soul at its center. I'm now Leamas' age, have had my own disappointments and heartaches (as well as my own glancing brush with the intelligence world), and I felt the man's every ache and twinge of doubt.<br /><br />If you never read any other spy book, read The Spy Who Came In from the Cold. It's everything Ludlum ever wanted to be and never was.

B0090SI4HO|3.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger promised he'd be back and now he is following his stint as governor of California  In the Last Stand, in his first starring role in nearly a decade, but it isn't all it should be as a comeback vehicle, don't get me wrong, it's good to have the big guy back on the big screen where he belongs, but the Last Stand ends up being only a modest return and a little bit of a disappointment.<br /> As a movie, the Last Stand plays as a movie at least a two decades or more out of step with current audiences. It is a modern day western that hits all the lazy western clichés. It's actually little more than a contemporary version of Rio Bravo with Arnie as John Wayne and Johnny Knoxville as Walter Brennan, it even has a town drunk who's redeemed by standing tall alongside Schwarzenegger.<br /> The movie also couldn't have come at a worst time, with gun control as a hot bed issue. The Last Stand has enough of a pro-gun stance to please any card carrying member of the NRA. Set in an Arizona border town where everyone is packing heat and is either a redneck or a hillbilly.<br /> The Last Stand has about three story threads running through it. The first is the already mentioned neo-western starring Arnold. There is also one long continuous car chase involving an escaped fugitive, which looks like a very exciting car commercial, but a somethat boring movie. Then there is the counter point sub plot with Forrest Whitaker as a dogged FBI agent hunting said fugitive and having lots of unconving discourse, this is easily the least satisfying part of the movie.<br /> Schwarzenegger plays Ray Owen, a would-be Arizona cowboy who's actually a former L.A. narcotics officer. The role was originally written for Liam Neeson, it should have been written been written for Clint Eastwood. As long as you forget the details easily, like that name, Schwarzenegger actually does a very good job. He's as tough and strong as ever, but is more venerable that a lot of other movie tough guys, no longer a one man army or inhuman machine without feelings. He is still a strong and likable film presence, it's easy to forget just how good a movie star or even a good actor that he really is.<br /> It is an enthusiastic occasionally laughable shoot 'em up, but very much a forgettable \\"B\\" movie. Not completely unsatisfying, but not the triumphant return for Arnold Schwarzenegger. If anything it serves as a fearsome warning that a lot of these aging action stars are not only long in the tooth, but out of touch with contemporary values.<br /> The Last Stand is the English language debut of Jee-Won Kim. A South Korean director who's filmography, up to this point, has been very impressive. As  the director of the eerie horror film A Tale of Two Sisters, the brutal revenge thriller I Saw the Devil and the wonderfully giddy fun \\"teriyaki style western\\" the God, the Bad and the Weird. Jee-won gave lots of hope for this film, but he seems to be stifled by American filmmaking. I sincerely hope that this great talent does not find himself bogged down by formulaic action movies in the way that the equally fine director John Woo was.<br /> At least the Last Stand has a mostly game supporting cast including the excellent Spanish actor Eduardo Noriega as the central bad guy, but it is the wonderful Peter Stormare who is the film's main antagonist for the bulk of it's one hundred and three running time speaking with a southern fried American accent via way of Sweden. Also making a brief appearance is Harry Dean Stanton as a cantankerous shotgun wielding old codger. And as we know, no movie with Harry Dean Stanton in it can be all bad.<br /> However Johnny Knoxville serves as the unnecessary \\"comic relief\\" in a humorless role, fortunately he is not as much of a presence as his second billing would indicate. Also very much a sore spot is Luis Guzman, who was once a great character actor, but now just seems to be cast as annoying often cowardly dufases, this being no exception.<br />  Relative newcomers Jamie Alexander and Rodrigo Santoro stand out as Schwarzenegger's more serious deputies. Whitaker adds charisma in an undistinguished supporting role, but he is able to spout dialogue like \\"a psychopath in a Batmobile\\" with a straight face.<br /> Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the great movie stars not just of the last thirty years, but of all-time and more than deserves a rightful film comeback, but this is not it. A half backed mostly uninteresting routine action flick. It's not Schwarzenegger's last stand, but if he doesn't choose his future projects more carefully he will continue to show his age in more ways than one. A modest failure in my opinion, but a failure none the less.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Ben Affleck's Argo is a smart political drama, an exhilarating espionage thriller and a sharp Hollywood satire, that  not only is a successes at all three, but manages to be among the very best of it's various genres.  Detailing American's first encounter with political Islam, it is also a love letter to the enchantment of the movies and the power that is yielded  the world over by people's fascination and dreams of movie magic.<br /> Right from the beginning showing the old studio logo for Warner Bros., circa 79-80, the fastidious detail to the period and the extremes that Affleck and his talented cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto went to to achieve an \\"authentic\\" look to the film are astonishing. The movie was filmed on celluloid, blown up two hundred times as to allow it a natural graininess. Prieto also manages to successfully duplicate camera movements from pictures of the particular time and era.<br /> Taking place in that moment when cinema of the 1970's, when \\"movies mattered\\" and where cherished personal statements, and the 1980's, when entering the post Star Wars era of special effects and endless sequels. Argo manages to resemble a lost film from the late Sydney Pollack, a movie from that moment in time that like the classics of the era in which it depicts, manages to successfully cross meaningful moviemaking with thoroughly entertaining amusement. It has been cheekily called the last great movie of the 1970's.<br /> The strengths in Argo are many, including the way the movie is able to  effectively blend historical fact along with Hollywood fiction, to make an intelligent, electrifying remarkably engaging and funny movie. Working from the crisp and knowledgeable screenplay of Chris Terrio, based in part on a magazine article by Joshua Bearman and on Tony Mendez's autobiographical book \\"the Master of Disguise\\" Argo chronicles a true life tale that is stranger than fiction, as the cliché goes.<br /> Mendez was a CIA \\"exfiltration\\" specialist, who  brainstorms an idea that would help free six American diplomats placed in harms way during the Iranian revolution after managing to flee the American embassy before the terrorist takeover. They have found temporary refuge at the Canadian ambassador's home. The CIA's plan  is to send in bicycles for the American's to ride three hundred miles to safety, an operative will be sent in to train them to use said bikes if necessary.<br /> Mendez has a better bad idea, using a former agent now working in Hollywood he will set up a fake sci-fi movie, called \\"Argo\\"  and smuggle the Americans out of Tehran as members of the crew claiming that they were on a location scouting trip. To pull this off he must set everything up as fractural as possible, which seems to be the whole feel of the movie, both the fictional and real Argo.<br /> The idea comes to Mendez from watching a Planet of the Apes movie, a true life case of monkey see, no? It's hard to distinguishes the facts from the artistic license because we know that the truth is so often this way. I am reminded that after the events of September 11, 2001 that the government did meet with Hollywood screenwriters to ask<br />for their input on terrorist scenarios, to possibly avoid further attacks. I don't wish to know the differences between the reality and the movie reality. I am confident that much of the third act is indeed movie formula, it feels as such, but I don't think that anyone is really going to care because it is so cleverly done and amusing in the process.<br /> Argo is one of the funniest and most droll films this year. It understands the absurdity of it's situation, but never resorts to cheap shots or descends into parody. The two major performances here are those of John Goodman as real life make-up effects artist John Chambers, Mendez's contact in Hollywood. Even better though is the great Alan Arkin, as Lester Siegel, a past his prime movie producer with  an abundance of (bad) attitude and sarcastic remarks to easily steal the show and make off like a bandit with it . His foul mouthed, cantankerous geriatric will remind audiences of his Oscar winning role from Little Miss Sunshine. Although I think he is funnier here and gets one of the year's great lines of comic dialogue, it's the one that involves the film`s title, for those who`ll be curious later.<br /> The rest of the cast is remarkably fine as well, with numerous strong performances from an abundance of familiar faces including Bryan Cranston, an unbilled Philip Baker Hall, Clea DuVall, Tate Donovan, Rory Cochran, Victor Garber, Michael Parks, Bob Gunton, Richard Kind and a delicious role for Scream Queen Adrienne Barbeau, who was a star in the era which this is set. Affleck is nothing if not a generous director when it comes to his actors.<br /> Affleck has had an amazing comeback in recent years, now excepted as a first rate filmmaker, among the finest actors turned directors with his name mentioned amongst giants such as Clint Eastwood, Warren Beatty and Robert Redford. Argo offers Affleck the chance to yet again shine as a leading man, his recent roles have been parts of ensembles like excellent the Company Men and his own terrific achievement the Town. Here Affleck is the star and the anchor to this thrilling and suspenseful true life drama. I'm sure many stars could have played the part, but Affleck is a good actor with movie star charisma and once more is allowed to shine in that capacity. Affleck has earned the right to star in his movie, where many actors direct their favorite star, being themselves,<br />this is Affleck`s first time shining the spotlight on himself.<br /> Argo is so accomplished that one never really notices that the story is little more than a routine movie thriller. Or that we already know the outcome of the events. The plot unfolds so captivatingly and Affleck's direction is so masterful that the few weaknesses of the picture are never apparent and easily ignorable.<br /> Aided in no small measure because Argo is a gripping story with a concrete strong human center. For two exhilarating hours it manages to serves up a well spun yarn, At time the tension is breathtaking, exhilarating to a point of apprehension. The history plays in such a way to mirror current events and enlighten those of us too young to recall these events as they happened. It is also a very funny and good natured movie full of deserved uplift and celebration of heroes, both real and invented.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B008JFUMT2|1.0|Oh my god and wow where the words I found myself uttering as I left the multiplex after seeing A Good Day to Die Hard. The wow came out of a disbelief that I had just seen what I had and the oh my god was a lament for witnessing a dear old friend senselessly slaughtered.<br /> The Die Hard series has long been the zeitgeist of action cinema with it's mix of sly, but knowing humor, well developed, likeable and believable characters, it's awesome visuals effects and it's well filmed action scenes, even the more outlandish sequels were always kept in check by following these simple guidelines. However, that is now all gone, A Good Day to Die Hard has none of those things, and it's not even mindless, but enthusiastic entertainment, it's just simply mind numbing.<br /> Once again starring as John McClane is Bruce Willis, this time finding himself racing all across mother Russia in pursuit of his estranged son who's a \\"fugitive\\" in the country. John, Jr. (newcomer Jai Courtney), wanted on a drug charge, I believe, is actually a CIA operative trying to get information from a gangster (Sebastian Koch) that leads to a high ranking Russian official, who himself will stop at nothing to silence his former comrade.<br /> The script barely has enough plot to get from A to Z. Littered with bad dialogue, repetitive catchphrases that don't work and endless gunfire. Never does the script by Skip Woods slow down to give us character development, in fact the McClanes may be estranged, but they honestly seem like strangers and their bonding scene is laughable, in an otherwise humorless movie.<br /> By now, Willis must now McClane inside out, but here he doesn't even seem to be playing the guy from those earlier adventures. Gone is his wisecracking smart alky everyman  reluctant hero, in his place is an angry, obnoxious superman.<br /> However, Willis is not the only one who gives a tedious performance, Australian actor Jai Courtney is a real lumbering stiff of a hero. In his defense, the role has nothing to offer any actor, good or bad. But, Courtney doesn't infuse it with any charisma.  He and Willis have zilch when it comes to on-screen chemistry.<br /> Directed by the terrible John Moore, the misguided director who once tried to turn Owen Wilson into an action hero in the ludicrous Behind Enemy Lines. He also helmed the great looking, but boring Max Payne and the dreadful remakes of the Omen and Flight of the Phoenix. What I just don't understand is why the studio, Twentieth Century Fox, would pawn off such a lucrative franchise to an obvious hackneyed director. Yes, he's a company man, but never has one of his films been a success finically or artistically. His direction is flat, lifeless and clearly ambitionless. Just look at how far the James Bond movies have come in recent years by using quality filmmakers.<br /> Employing a now all too typical unsteady camera, that just annoys, it doesn't put you into the action. A Good Day to Die Hard has one of the least interesting and poorly edited car chases in movie history right out front to get things started. It's followed by nonsensical shoot outs in a very shallow script full of unlikely plot developments. Then we have some overblown stunts, that do nothing to elevate the interest. All leading up to some very, very bad special effects at the end.<br /> I would call A Good Day to Die Hard, the worst movie in the franchise by a long shot, but it never even feels like a Die Hard movie. It's already been established that aside from his usual catchphrase they isn't anything that connects Willis' character to his previous films. But the tone is off, and aside from paying homage to Alan Rickman's death in the first film, although it could be parody it is hard to tell here, they is little linking of these films. Mary Elizabeth Weinstead reprise her role as Lucy McClane in a pointless cameo, and she too seems to be acting out another role.<br /> The funny thing is that Woods' script is said to be the first Die Hard script written as a Die Hard movie. But Woods is a fairly stale and unimaginative writer, having penned such gems as X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the big screen A-Team movie and the long forgotten John Travolta-Hugh Jackman cyber thriller Swordfish. Not an once of depth or consideration is given to these characters, not one word of clever dialogue is uttered, in fact I think there is a purpose minimum of words used.<br /> It turns out the much maligned PG-13 rating for infinitely better Live Free or Die Hard, was the least of it's problems. A Good Day to Die Hard is R-rated, but you really wouldn't know it. The violence isn't edgier and the language is hardly foul, that would require the actors using more words and the script just couldn't allow that.<br /> In the previous films, the villains have been of great interest, we can even remember the name of Hans Gruber, but these villains are just stock baddies. Actually, A Good Day to Die Hard doesn't even make it clear who is the main villain, as we keep changing our main antagonist like in a video game, when one dies another just assumes his role. I wouldn't remember any of these villains by name, except there all Russkies with names like Yuri, Ivan and Viktor,  even the names are clichés.<br /> It's not unreasonable to expect at least a minimum of good escapist entertainment from a Bruce Willis movie, and if that is all you ask of A Good Day to Die Hard,  you still will be let down. Maybe it is that Die Hard has set such a high standard for action movies, but still there is no excuse for making such a sloppy mess.<br /> In years to come, A Good Day to Die Hard will be uttered in the same breath as the dismal Jaws: the Revenge. It should be studied as what not to not do it again, this is a textbook example of how to kill a finically successful franchise in a single blow.<br /> At ninety-seven minutes, it is the shortest Die Hard movie, but feels longer than watching all four previous movies in a single uninterrupted sitting. As it turns out, today just was not a good day to die hard instead of going out with a bang, it just goes out with a thud.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|No fun, I didn't spend much time on this, I enjoyed Lep's World much more<br />I may revisit this later but not now
B0090SI42Y|1.0|When a movie is \\"presented by\\" Quentin Tarantino, written by the RZA and Eli Roth and stars Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu you have a right to at least expect it to resemble a professionally made film. The new would-be Wuxia epic the Man With the Iron Fists is like an amateur production ,a bastardized cross between a Shaw Brothers martial arts adventure and a feature length movie trailer. Full of hype and missed potential, this is no better than any random cheaply made direct-to-DVD movie without big names. In this case so much talent, equals so much waste.<br /> First time director RZA is a well known fan of classic martial arts films, his rap group the Wu Tang Clan used a great deal of wuxia imagery in their music, starting with their name. If RZA does in fact love the genre, this is a bad representation of that, treating the wuxia genre as little more than a joke, one that`s not funny either. In a post Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-era, the desire to apologize for martial arts movies would seem to no longer be a needed defense.<br /> Wuxia, the current cool in thing for westerners to call the martial arts genre, in Chinese it means heroic or chivalrias martial arts stories.  Wuxia pictures have been around nearly as long as movies themselves, but only recently have they ascended to there rightful place in Western film culture. The genre is now excepted, with critically studies that have allowed the once ghettoized genre a well deserved appreciated,<br /> These movies share much in common with the American western, easterns if you will, and like the western many of the best folk tales told in their culture have unfold on film within this noble genre. It is also worth noting that a lot of these movies are nearly as good as the classic American westerns, especially the HK Shaw Brothers titles of the 60's and 70's and directors  such as Cheng Cheh, King Hu and Li Chuai Ling are comparable to the likes of Sam Peckinpah, John Sturges or Anthony Mann, Now we add this movieto the association, one that is not only an embarrassment, but an insult, the Man With the Iron Fists takes the accomplished merits back several decades.<br /> The script is ludicrous, jumbled, disoriented and rambling. Eli Roth came on board to help RZA form and finish his screenplay, I can't imagine he did a lot of  the finished work, while not a tremendous writer. Roth's work usually is far more creditable than this.<br /> The dialogue in the Man With the Iron Fist is excruciating, spoken with corny sincerity. This no doubt is meant to be \\"homage\\" to the old English dubbed kung fu epics of the past, now does that not sound like a mistake. It just doesn't work when the lips match up with these unspeakable lines of discourse.<br /> Russell Crowe adds class and credibility, which are otherwise sorely lacking. Crowe has top billing, but plays a rather thankless supporting role, but offers an occasional distraction from the rest of the frivolities. Crowe also has never looked so out of shape, with his full beard and middle age spreading he's starting to resemble Orson Welles. Just why did Crowe do this film, it's mind-boggling to think of such a talented actor and huge movie star wasting his offerings on this.<br /> Lucy Liu is likeably enthusiastic, but the role is under developed and she's left floundering. Part of the reason for this is that the whole movie is terribly misogynistic, the woman are all whores and are either treacherous or just merrily in the way, one character is both. Liu's presence will also no doubt make viewers recall the far superior Kill Bill.<br /> The rest of the cast is a liability, \\"WWE superstar\\" Dave Bautista once again shows he has no acting skills what so ever. UFC champ Cung Le is still failing at his attempts to be a movie star. Rick Yune and Jamie Chung have to little screen time to make much impact as token Asian heroes. Pam Grier, Gordon Liu and Chen Kuan-tai show up in pointless cameos that just remind you of better movies you could be watching. As an actor RZA is better than he is a director, but not noticeably so. Playing the film's title character and narrator, like his direction, RZA speaks a lot, but says little.<br /> Is it too much to ask for the Man With the Iron Fists  to at the very least be a fun guilty pleasure, but no such luck. The movie lacks any sort of post Tarantino-style of self aware humor, or any intentional humor at all. The film is too brutally gory for it's own good , it is also unnecessarily profane, which does not keep with the genre's traditions, but seems designed to appeal to the hip-hop crowd. It is all so predicable, terribly derivative and worst of all boring. It is a long ninety-six minutes when a martial arts movie lacks even the credibility of a Kung Fu Panda flick.<br /> Cheaply made and very much looking it, I have to seriously wonder if RZA's intentions were not to make a bad movie. If so, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. This is not like Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse, which had a lot of fun making bad movies better. The Man With the Iron Fists manages to make good movies appear bad.<br />  In theory this movie should have rocked, but it does anything but. RZA proves to be a lousy writer, a half assed actor and worst no filmmaker. RZA allegedly spent some seven years trying to get this made and the original run time is said to have been four hours long, I do have to ponder if it was any more coherent, but glad I don`t have to find out.  .<br /> RZA does fill the movie with an effective audible soundtrack, from hip-hop numbers to Cantonese pop tunes, not to mention a nicely rousing score. The movie looks good, it's visually striking with clever editing and good photography, but lousy action sequences in a dull and unpleasant turkey. The tagline is that this puts the f.u. in kung fu, that's not clever, that's just being honest.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty is a controversial, button pushing account of the manhunt and eventual assassination of Osama bin Laden and just how it all came to be. One's politics will most likely play a substancal role in their enjoyment of this film, I find far too few people are able to put such things aside.<br /> However, Zero Dark Thirty  wisely neither condemns nor condoles the actions of the CIA and United States military, it takes more of a journalist's eye view to it's subject matter, it is detached from it`s material. It is also a completely engrossing and engulfing, well paced crackerjack of a thriller that doesn't strive to please or entertain per se, but manages to do both quite nicely all the same.<br /> Told as a step by step procedural of the CIA's actions and involvement in the manhunt for bin Laden. But the focus is on the single minded resolve of the woman who courageously and audaciously led the hunt. This is one film that can't be critized for not providing a strong female character. As Maya, the determined CIA agent Jessica Chastain once more gives a strong and absorbing performance, she has been nominated for an Oscar for this role, her second in as many years. For my money she deserves the award, but most likely will not get it,  playing a strong, defiant and independent woman and not reducing her to a cliché action hero, damsel in distress or even attempting to make her a likable protagonist, she simply has a job to do and don't get in her way.<br /> All of this told through Bigelow's finely honed lens, previously only a good director of mostly routine and forgettable potboilers like Point Break  and Blue Steel, but also the underappreciated Strange Days and the excellent vampire/psychos on the open road neo-western Near Dark. In 2010 she became the surprise first woman to win an Academy Award for directing, which she richly deserved for the superb the Hurt Locker. Reteaming here with her Hurt Locker collaborator screenwriter Mark Boal, they have a riveting movie chemistry for making great dramatic thrillers.<br /> Zero Dark Thirty wants to be a conversation piece, it wants to make you uncomfortable The fact that it is also so entertaining is beside the point. The torture scenes, which have been much a source of debate, are graphic and unpleasant, which seems appropriate. The camerawork is not flashy, nor is it intrusive, it wisely serves as little more than just a bystander or as a witness.<br /> The dialogue is tough sounding, but realistic to the ears. Boal writes like a reporter, everything sounds over heard. The meetings with high ranking officals give us the feeling of a fly on the wall with top security clearance.<br /> The late French film critic and auteur filmmaker of the finest order Francois Truffett was quoted as saying that the best way to critize a movie was with the making of another movie. This used to be a favorite saying of Roger Ebert on the old Siskel & Ebert at the Movies TV show. I am surprised that so few have drawn any comparisons with the critically lambasted Act of Valor. In case you don't remember that one, it's the movie released earlier in 2012 that stared real life Marines in a fictional propaganda adventure film. It looked like an Army recruitment commercial, \\"be all you can be\\", \\"it`s not a job, it`s an adventure\\", etc. Zero Dark Thirty mages to be serious, where Act of Valor was silly, one is unflinching and ugly, the other a shameful misinformative ad.<br /> Bigelow it would seem now makes the hard hitting topical films that Oliver Stone used to make, someone like say John Wayne or Ronald Reagon would have loved Act of Valor, but would have been appalled by Zero Dark Thirty's resolute neo-patriotism.<br /> Zero Dark Thirty also serves as the greatest celebration of intelligence in the movies of late. Not just of government intelligence, but of the individual's hard work and dogged determination.<br /> The best movies of 2012 have also been the most controversial, From Tarantino's Django Unchained to Ben Affleck's Argo and the under seen Cloud Atlas. 2012 was a year that brought a lot of thoughts to movie screens, a lot of discussions raised, no easy answers to be found. I can't remember a year when so many films pushed so many boundaries and ran the risk of offending and alienating so many.<br /> But it is good to see so many thoughts put out there, so many daring films made and so many willing filmmakers. Maybe we are entering a new era where the term \\"a thinking person's movie\\" wont be meet with automatic scorn and fear from the masses. Then again, I could be wrong.<br /> The first thing we see on screen is a promise that what we are about to see is based on actual first hand accounts. One of the many sources of controversy and speculation. Some critics have laid the claimed that it is fabricated , or at least to some degree. Just a few months ago Fox news pundits claimed Bigelow had been given classified information in the making of this film(?). Oh well, it's tight and taunt and one thriller worth getting worked up about. Zero Dark Thirty is one movie that wont be forgotten, it's a new classic that we have been privileged of witnessing being born.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B008C0C1Y8|2.0|With the  release of the startling excellent new film Dredd starring Karl Urban, I decided to revisit the 1995 adaptation of Judge Dredd, which is  purely coincidental being released on Blu-ray the same week . You may remember this as Sylvester Stallone's forerunner to Arnold Schwarzenegger's comic book turn in Batman & Robin, if your fortunate you don't. It would be a misnomer to say that time has been unkind to Judge Dredd as 1995 wasn't too kind to it either.<br /> Making his Demolition Man look like intellectual high art in comparison, Stallone stars as Judge \\"Joseph\\" Dredd, I place the name in quotes because no where in the Dredd mythology I have seen on line tells me that he has a first name let alone such a generic one, I would have gone with Zowie or Starbuck if I had been the writer. Anyway, in this grim, but colorful future, society has run amok with most people living inside closed off mega cities, those not so lucky live in the post-apocalyptic world outside called \\"the cursed Earth\\". The Judges are a band of elite cops, who also act as jury and executioner, there are no defenses, pardons or what not, still everyone pleads innocent.<br /> Dredd (Sly) is the most fearsome, toughest, silliest looking of all the judges, his name is spoken in such a way to tell us so. This time however he finds himself on the wrong side of the law (\\"I am the law\\"), framed for a murder and forced to go the Richard Kimble route to prove his innocence, taking along with him a petty criminal (Rob Schneider) who has the misfortune to be handcuffed or shackled or something to Dredd.<br /> The bad guy is a rogue Nazi judge (Jurgen Prochnow) who has his sights set on an even more cluttered future world with cloned judges doing the jobs of totally capable currently living officers. So he in lists the help of Ricco (Armand Assante) who also happens to be Dredd's brother and whom he judged and sent to prison. Yada yada yada.<br /> I wish I could say that the movie has never looked moredreadful, but truth is that it looks pretty darn good in this new Blu-ray edition. We can see and appreciate the hard work that went into the corny, but stylish production design. The visual effects are quite good, even by today's standards, not as much silly looking CGI as I had expected, this future world looks sort of like the world of the Fifth Element, maybe at night. It's such a vivid creation it's a shame it's in the service of such a routine action picture.<br /> Stallone is severely miscast as Dredd, he looks and sounds silly, also I have never seen him hammier than this. The performance is so broad, you have to wonder is Sly thought this was a comedy. However, an interesting review by Roger Ebert from the time of the movie's release has him disagreeing with me and writing that Stallone is \\"ideal for a role this, because he is smart enough and funny enough to pull it off.\\" I like Stallone too, I gleefully overpraised his recent the Expendables 2, but I'm not sure what Roger was thinking, Sly isn't funny and I wont touch upon the subject of his smarts.<br /> Also very bad is Schneider, in a role written for Joe Pesci, he seems badly out of place. He has terrible one liners, slows down the action, and is completely unnecessary. This movie is already too campy, we don't require additional comic relief.<br /> Yet, it is this film's strong supporting cast that stands out. Assante and Prochnow are excellent as the villains. Diane Lane is gorgeous and tough in equal measures as Dredd's partner and love interest. There are good bits from James Remar and Scott Wilson. Max Von Sydow delivers a surprisingly vivid and moving performance that doesn't belong here, but is very welcome none the less. Joan Chen, unfortunately appears just so that Lane has someone to fight with at the end.<br /> I always felt that this movie either needed to be a lot tougher or a lot more comical, the recent film tells me it's the former, not the later. Still, I have got to admit, it wasn'tas bad as I remember it being. The flying motorcycle chase recalls the final to Star Wars, and the closing theme song by the Cure is a little beauty all it's own. Despite it's R-rating, this is much more tame than many PG-13 films today, and will be best appreciated by those not old enough for the new movie and too young to recall the first released.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|The success or  failure of  Jack Reacher will depend on your ability to accept Tom Cruise as a bad ass, I have never found Cruise to be a particular believable action star, but he is a great movie star and has managed to just barely pull it off before. After the success of the excellent Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol, the best of it's series, Cruise seemed prime for a comeback,. But alas Jack Reacher is not it.<br /> Based on Lee Child's novel \\"One Shot\\", where Jack Reachner is a mid-fifties 6'5 250lb. bad ass, Cruise assumes the role in none too believable style. When he tells one character \\"that I'll drink your blood from a boat\\", the compulsion is too laugh, which I don't believe was the desired effect. This role cries out for Liam Neeson or anyone of a number of aging action film stars.<br /> In the last decade or so movie stars like, say Richard Gere have looked towards being taken seriously as dramatic actors and strengthen their acting muscle. Cruise, on the other hand, seems to have focused his attention on being accepted as an action hero.<br /> For a routine potboiler Cruise sure seems to believe this to be a vanity project, evident by the fact that I saw his name at least three times during the opening titles. He uses the role to flex his muscles, literally, but was better served by the comical send-up of Rock of Ages.<br /> Adapted and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who it's hard to believe won an Oscar years ago for his clever modern crime masterpiece the Usual Suspects, his move into the director's chair has been an awkward one. He is a thoroughly capable director see his debut film the excellent [[ASIN:B002NPY7EU The Way of the Gun [Blu-ray]]], but this one suffers from the miscasting of his lead actor.<br />  Jack Reacher begins with a sniper attack on what appears to be a bunch of innocent passer bys, coming only a few days after the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, where twenty children were sensuously killed along with six adults. I thinkthis movie might hit a little too close for some people, it certainty loses some of it's escapist appeal to such.<br /> Cruise is surrounded by a hefty supporting cast, but sadly both Rosumund Pike and Richard Jenkins are badly used. German filmmaker Werner Herzog, however, does make for an amusing villain with a soft spoken hiss in his voice, Herzog comes across as one of the film's rare highlights. Likewise, old codger Robert Duvall is a welcome sight in an all too brief role as a retired Marine gunnery sergeant who aids Reacher in the expected climax. Duvall also manages to be a more suitable action star at nearly eighty years of age, than Cruise does at fifty.<br /> The production looks good, competently shot by Caleb Deschanel, and above average editing, even in the obligatory car chase, are perhaps the only things that separates this from a typically generic DTD movie. In fact Jack Reacher may have benefited going the TV detective movie route like Tom Selleck has in his above average  Jesse Stone series of TV movies.<br /> At two hours and ten minutes, Jack Reacher runs at least thirty minutes too long. This allows for a lot of wondering and lost audience anticipation because it's pretty obvious where the movie is heading, it just takes too long to get there.<br /> I like and have been known to praise an action movie when it raise to a certain level and becomes more than just an action movie, the recent James Bond adventure Skyfall or last year's Ryan Goessling vehicle Drive are good examples of this. However, I must pan an action flick, when it becomes less than an action film, and I feel that is pretty much the case with Jack Reacher.<br /> Aside from Cruiser's miscasting, the movie never offers much intrigue, suspense, thrills or intensity. It fails as an action movie, it fails as a mystery because the plot developments are so apparent and it fails as a thriller because it never manages to thrill.<br /> It all comes to strangely ambiguous ending, after thefact, that sounds as if the movie is building to something more. I guess the filmmaker's were looking ahead to the sequel, which I doubt will happen..<br /> This wont be Tom Cruise's next big franchise, in fact each vehicle makes him seem less relevant than before. It is a shame because he is one of contemporary's great movie stars, but perhaps now is a good time to hang up the cape and look forward  to establishing himself as something the movies really need, a strong capable actor. Heading down this route the best he has to look forward to is a spot in the next Expendables movie, but maybe that's what Cruise longs for.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|What more can you say, Rihanna makes the dance/pop genre fun entertaining and makes you want to shake your tail feathers.
B005LAII80|4.0|Ever noticed that in the movies the future is never a place you want to be. Like a tidal wave or an out of control fire in a disaster flick, the future is just another form of a big bad movie monster. Mega-city One of the new movie Dredd is no exception. A bleak future for sure, where 800 million people live in an enclosed society which stretches from Boston to D.C., where crime runs rampant, there are twelve major crimes committed per minute. Inside the Peach Tree block, which is where the majority of the action takes place, there is an unemployment rate of 96%, I'm not sure if that includes the drug dealers and slum lords or not.<br /> When I first heard of the updated Judge Dredd I mockingly joked that the tagline should read \\"do you Dredd it\\", I wasn't expecting much after the terrible Sylvester Stallone failed blockbuster of the 1990's, but I couldn't have been more erroneous in my assumption. Dredd turns out to be one of the most exhilarating comic book adventures in a while, it is also a puff of welcome retro rehashed air that is pretty enthralling to take in.<br /> Taking a more scaled back, realistic and understated approach than the nineties movie did, this is like a good looking 80's action-sci-fi throwback that captures the spirit of that era batter than some other recent films. It's stark, dark and engulfing in it's slant. In many ways it is the opposite of the earlier screen incarnation.<br /> In this gritty and grimy future world the Judges are the only thing standing in the way of anarchy, they are cops, but they also act as the whole juridical system including jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the biggest bad ass of them all, sent on a routine call he and his rookie partner (Olivia Thirlby) find themselves cornered off and trapped inside the Peach Tree block, which is run by the ruthless drug manufacturer Ma-Ma (Lena Heady) and her clan. Her new drug of choice, slo-mo, allows it's uses to experience the world at one percent of it's normal speed, so it's like the reversal of crack. She means business when it comes to not allowing the Judges to escape with their suspect, a gang member (Wood Harris) who can blow the lid off of her whole organization.<br /> The plot is nicely uncomplicated, in this day and age when action films so often allow themselves to get bogged down in overtly complex scenarios. The minimalist approach isn't just limited to the storytelling, but also the visual effects, which are lightly peppered through out, stylish but never over dominating with a refreshing lack of cartoonish CGI. The production design is properly atmospheric, unlike it's blotted predecessor. The violence, while bloody and graphic, is  often limited to short sudden and thrilling outbursts.<br /> Played out as sort of a cross between \\"Dirty\\" Harry and Robocop is Dredd himself, now portrayed by Karl Urban, who is a much more ideal choice for this material than was Sly Stallone two decades ago. Urban plays the role with a deep serious growl to match his menacing scowl, a low toned voice to equal that of Clint Eastwood. I am not familiar with the comic book 2000AD, which is Dredd's source of origin, but I understand that it has it's serious devotees who were appalled by the earlier version, among the truer to it's source is the fact that Urban keeps his helmet on through out the entire picture creating a rewarding mystique about him.<br />. As Cassandra Anderson, Olivia Thirlby is the emotional center to the film, a newbie who may not be cut out for the kind of fascist justice she is required to deal out. Originating from the same slums she's targeting she has a more conflicted view than does Dredd. She is also a mutant, not with three breasts or anything, but she is psychic so she knows one's guilt or innocence, as well as their true motivations. Thirlby is very impressive here, she all but owns the movie, with dirty blonde hair and deeply expressive eyes, I'm glad  she's not kept behind a helmet the whole time, she's also more fun to look at than Urban.<br /> Also quite admirable is Lena Headey, Sarah Connor from TV's incarnation of the Terminator franchise and the movie 300, she is a force to be reckoned with as the film's main villain. A woman who's as strong as any of the men in the picture and as scary as any villain this year.<br /> The story and it's approach recall the best work of John Carpenter, as does Paul Leonard-Morgan's excellent mood setting techno score which helps set the pace the way Carpenter was known to do with music in the past. Likewise, the taunt ninety-five minute run time and keen editing by Mark Eckersley, who was responsible for the little seen gem of tension  the Disappearance of Alice Creed, keeps the proceedings crisp and thrilling.<br /> Regrettably the unnecessary 3-D effects hamper the truly exceptional roaming cinematography of Anthony Dod Mantle, an Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire. I found the 3-D to be typically murky, the movie has a pale color scheme that does not lend itself well to the extra dimension,  and about half way in I just took the glasses off as it was giving me a migraine, fortunately my headache elevated and I was able to appreciate the excellent photography as it was. I don't think that this will be a problem on the DVD and Blu-ray releases, which is where I figure most people are likely to see this, for anyone seeing it in a cinema, I would suggest going the 2-D route.<br /> All coming together under an intense script from Alex Garland, who made this into a life fulfilling passion project. Garland allegedly clashed with director Pete Travis over the finished film, coming in behind him and finishing the venture himself. I only know one other movie by Travis, the undistinguished Vantage Point, but some of his other work has been better received. No matter, the behind the scenes tensions do not come across on the screen as things could not have looked better.<br /> Narrativley this is somewhat like the criticallyembraced Indonesian movie the Raid: Redemption, from earlier this year. This hard R-rated action movie left me felling fully pumped by the time of it's conclusion. Being released the last day of Summer, I'll be damned, but this may well be the kick a** movie of the year.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I really do like all music, so having this album was a no brainer. Taylor Swift the darling of country music is making a venture more into mainstream pop and she succeeded.
B0087DFIOU|4.0|In recent years Mel Gibson has successfully self destructed and taken his career along with himself into a black hole. Which is a terrible shame as he is one of the best and most charismatic actors to ever grace the screen, but personal demons and a less than friendly public demeanor has all but destroyed his once glorious star power. Get the Gringo should have helped set things right, if not karmicly at least financially,  but a poor release strategy has kept many people from seeing the film. Now out on DVD and Blu-ray, this film from first time director Adam Grunberg is a surprising little gem lost in the summer glut.<br /><br />Gibson stars as Reginald T. Barnes, if we are to believe that is his name, an ex-sniper turned career criminal. The movie opens with he and an accomplice dressed as clowns and fleeing American law enforcement. A robbery the two were involved with goes south, so does he, escaping across the border only to land in police custody on the other side. Relieved of his booty and sent to  El Puebilto, a Mexican prison, on trumped up charges. He is forced to change his game strategy, not only to survive, but to also get a little payback.<br /><br />Once inside, he finds the Mexican prison system to be a little unusual. The prison is run by one man, Javi (Daniel Gimez Cacho), who deals in everything from prostitution to drugs inside. He discovers that whole families are living inside, non convicts are free to come and go. There he unlikely befriends a ten year-old kid (Kevin Hernandez) and his mom (Dolores Heredia), who as it turns out have a score to settle with Javi.<br /><br />Gibson triumphantly returns to the kind of role and screen persona that made him such a popular action star in the 80's and 90's. Displaying oodles of charm, sarcasm and bravado tough guy attitude. A role he knows so well, not just because he has mastered it, but because he is also one of the screenwriters along with director Grunberg and Stacy Perskie.<br /><br />Get the Gringo has a great sense of parody, you could say it takes place in an extreme prison. Filled with great looking action scenes, sharp editing (by Steven Rosenblum),  and keen photography (from Benoit Debie). Shot on a relatively low budget, Mel used to get twenty-million a movie, now he stars in movies that cost twenty-million to make. The picture never looks cheap or shoddy.<br /><br />Originally titled \\"How I Spent My Summer Vacation\\", the ironic title better describes the concept healthier than the more expletive genre title does. A loose and very funny modern crime picture that is sure to appeal to a large audience, once word gets out and the general public finds it. Of course, there may have to be some forgiveness granted to Gibson, which for some will be too tall an order.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B002ZFQD04|5.0|The disc and case was in perfect and it played without any problems and the show was even better watching it on my tv than at the actual concert!!!
B005S9ELY4|4.0|Warner Bros. is a studio with a long and flavorful association with the gangster genre that dates back almost to the advent of sound pictures with enduring classics such as the Public Enemy, Little Caesar, White Heat and my personal favorite the Petrified Forest, continuing up to the modern era with the seminal Bonnie and Clyde and more contemporary movies such as Goodfellas, Heat, L.A. Confidential and Martin Scorsese's  Best Picture Oscar winning the Departed. While Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad most likely wont be joining the immortals, it is a fun and excessively exciting throwback to days of yore when the silver screen glistened with stars who could easily be identified by single names such as Bogie, Eddie G. or Cagney.<br /> Set in the post-war Las Angels of 1949, with a handsome production design by Mather Ahmad and the best cinematography any pulp action movie could ask for, provided by Dion Beebe. Beebe, an Oscar winner for Memoirs of a Geisha, but also the DP on the nourish tinged Collateral, Equilibrium and the motion picture of Miami Vice, here his camerawork is thrillingly and engulfing, every review I have read singles out his splendid work with significant praise, even the negative reviews.<br /> Praised as well critized with equal measure for it's highly stylized, often  flamboyant style of filmmaking. The movie plays successfully as a loving homage to the gangster classics it wants to immolate. The story maybe similar in ways to Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential, but it is actually a completely different animal aiming for the more low brow visually pleasing pulp of classic Warner gangsters. As such, I feel it is very successful, as I'm sure most will as long as they go in thinking more of Dick Tracy than Don Vito Corleone, or maybe just Al Pacino as Scarface with a slightly more colorful palette. Call it cartoonish cool.<br /> The plot involving a magnificent group of seven L.A. cops trying to take down the racket of mobster Mickey Cohen. Will recall the Untouchables and my pick for the best movie of the last fifteen years, the already mentioned L.A. Confidential. It's not in their league, but if you are inclined for this sort of pulverize entertainment, you wont be disappointed. The screenplay by Will Beall is chocked full of ostentatious hard boiled tough guy dialogue, based on a book by Paul Lieberman, it is Beall's first filmed movie script, but he is the author of the as-yet unfilmed \\"Lethal Weapon 5\\" and the \\"Logan's Run\\" redsux, at least judging from his work here it gives high hopes for those possible future projects. Yes, the story is familiar, obvious and filled with clichés, but I am not entirely uncertain that is not it's aim.<br /> Director Fleischer is a great stylist if not a great moviemaker, as the director behind the excellent and cheerfully cheeky Zombieland, but also the dismal 30 Minutes or Less, Fleischer does exhibit a wonderful visual flair which he puts to good use here in this highly visual movie.<br /> It would be nearly impossible however not to discuss the exceptional cast of Gangster Squad. Beginning with Josh Brolin in full leading man command, a fully watch able talent and likeable movie star all before getting to the fact that he is a first rate actor. All the same praise can be heaped on Ryan Gosling ten fold, it's amazing watching him play tough because he doesn't look like a bad ass, but is able pull it off on the sheer strength of his performance. I would hate to see him bogged down in action roles as he is such a great actor, probably the best of his generation, but after the exquisite Drive and the forthcoming A Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives, he seems to be choosing his roles very well even in the sometimes limited action movie genre.<br /> The rest of the gagster squad is fleshed out by top notch character performers such as the veteran Robert Patrick, Michael Pena coming off a star making turn in the excellent cop drama End of Watch, Giovanni Ribisi and Anthony Mackie with Nick Nolte as the chief of police.<br /> Nolte seems to be aging like a rock, he looks like solid brick and his rhapsitty voice is only getting deeper and more gruff, as an actor he could drive fear into your heart at 71 years old with just one scowl and when he declares that this \\"isn`t a crime wave, it/`s enemy occupation\\" you believe what he has to say. Patrick himself a long dependable character star, is offered his best role since his breakthrough of Terminator 2: Judgment Day some twenty-two years earlier, as an old gunslinger who prefers a six shooter to the more contemporary tommy gun.<br /> Emma Stone is a nice surprise, sultry and with the classic good looks meet style that recall starlets of yesteryear, particularly Lauren Bacall and other classic movie femme fatales of the silver screen past.<br /> However, make no mistake this is Sean Penn's movie. Giving an electrifying performance as Mickey Cohen who happily declares that this \\"the wild ****ing west\\"\\", aas the ex-boxer turned  gangster Penn gives the movie it`s meat and it`s center. It may not be a historically accurate portrayal of the man, but it is one that wont soon be forgotten. If there is anything that elevates Gangster Squad close to greatness it is Penn's performance, a richly textured evil that reminds us every time he's onscreen why this is a gangster picture and not a cop movie.<br /> As well known for their gangster and crime films as Universal was for their monsters and MGM for their musicals, the classic Warner Bros. tradition, unlike those others still survives and waves it's flag high and proud, and while Gangster Squad probably wont win any Oscars or be highly regarded in years to come, it is a satisfactory slice of juicy pulp fiction to sustain us until their next classic rolls<br />out.<br /><br />read my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B00BESIKWM|3.0|It was good, I would say, better than OK but I thought it was not as good as the first...
B0064MT1FI|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies...easy to see why Hunter and Paquin won Oscars for their performances. Sam Neill was also good as the man who married Hunter as his mail-order bride. Harvey Keitel is also excellent as the man who truly got to know Ada(Hunter) and understood her love for her piano, an instrument that gave her a \\"voice\\" to express her feelings. Paquin is precocious as Ada's daughter...one who is protective of her mother, while rebellious against her and the man her mother married. The New Zealand location was excellent, along with the Maori cultural influences. Very raw emotions are displayed from beginning to end. Highly recommend this one..for adults only. Children would not understand what is going on with all the different relationships that develop throughout the film.<br />Five stars all the way!!
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|I started listening to Bad Religion in 1994 when Stranger than Fiction came out.  It was actually the first CD I'd ever owned. I'm by no means an expert on punk music, or even music in general, but when the lyrics of these songs started to fill my head, it inspired so many different thoughts.  I played Stranger than Fiction so many times, I memorized the words to every song.  Until now, no album since then has inspired me to do such a thing.  I've been listening to True North pretty much every day since I've purchased it, and I do not regret buying it one bit.<br /><br />That isn't to say it's entirely the same as my previous experience;  I have noticed that the band has finally started to utilize the talent  of Brooks Wackerman, as is evident in the track &#34;My Head is Full of Ghosts,&#34; when he blasts the bass drums faster than I've ever heard in a Bad Religion song.  I don't know what it is about that in particular that sends chills down my spine, but it's definitely one of my favorite tracks because of it.<br /><br />I have nothing negative to say about this album.  I've looked for things about which to be critical, but I failed.  Maybe I'm just a fanboy, but I really don't care - I enjoy the hell out of this release.
0316017930|1.0|This product is simplistic and shows the author has very limited knowledge of the music business.  The 10,000 hour rule is ridiculous.  What really galls me is the number of people who should know better if they applied one ounce of critical thinking.  They go around repeating it as though this book was based on meaningful research.  Someone with a tin ear will never get anywhere with music even if they practice for 100,000 hours.  Mozart gets there a lot faster.  Life is way more complex.  Dialing in environment, genetics, socio-eonomic status, access, nurture, relationships, methodology, etc all make the 10,000 hour rule meaningless.
B006AN78XS|5.0|First, I'm a Woody Allen fan and have seen all of his films. My favorites are Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, Annie Hall and Love and Death, Vicki Christina Barcelona ... oh, wait, I like all of them!<br />Anyway, this is definitely a favorite and I bought it. First, Paris is absolutely gorgeous in this film.. romantic, beautiful, dazzling, mysterious, a brilliant city....second, the cast, as in every Allen film is great. He picks not only the most beautiful, interesting women, but the most interesting and talented and attractive men...the ones who are new to celebrity, and those who have been around a while..Owen Wilson is always enjoyable to watch and especially so in this film in which he plays the Woody Allen character, a writer with a huge imagination about to be married to a woman who doesn't get him at all. That plays out in a fairly predictable way and that's fine.<br />What I enjoyed so much about the film is the imaginative, sort of science fiction aspect, and how Allen brings the great writers and artists of the 20s to life, including Gay Paree. (Gay in the sense of wildly fun and creative, anything goes gay)...Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Gertrude Stein, Dali, Bunel and other luminaries come to life and through the strange series of events and meetings with them the Owen Wilson character learns a lesson, and we get it, too, about people and any particular time in history. The story ends well...as always the music is sublime and if you are a Woody Allen fan, and like brilliant, charming movies, you'll enjoy the heck out of this one.

Without describing the story , the movie has many funny and hilarious moments, especially during her military career. It's one of her classics which remains very funny despite the passage of time.

0007447868|2.0|This book was largely a mess.  It felt like it was written the way Charles Dickens used to do it when he was a story writer for the Victorian-era periodical rags and was paid by the word.  Only, the plot development AFFC wasn't as tight as Dickens, which is definitely not a compliment when referring to some of Dickens's work.<br /><br />Bottom line:  you can tell when a story has been artfully crafted.  GoT was a joy to read. Book 2 less so but still tight and satisfying.  Book 3 was beginning the downward slide.  This book is no longer storyteller's art.  It's more like a draft that needs some editing and fleshing out.<br /><br />For books yet to be published I hope Mr. Martin has listened to the many critics of his works instead of the sycophants who think his every word is a pearl, and gets back to the business of crafting a rousing story with tight character development instead of indulging his whims or pandering to the almighty dollar.<br /><br />Probably can't tell from this review, but I didn't hate it.  It just wasn't satifying.  I simply can't get over the feeling that we're being strung along so he can milk his plots into more books (translating into more $$).  To paraphrase Tolkien from FOTR, it feels thin, and sort of stretched, like butter that has been scraped over too much bread.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I would like to recommend this amazing book to my favorite people, my family members. Trust me when I say that this book will probably put a spell on you, you may not want to put down this book.
B0049VZ222|5.0|TWD is the best show I have watched in a very long time. It is so much more than a &#34;zombie&#34; show. The characters and their stories are  extremely well written!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very compelling. I enjoyed it very much. I'm anxious to read book 3.  I enjoyed the dramatic story line, not just the sexual side to the book.
B00846REIS|3.0|I have read the 50 Shades trilogy and was told about Bared to You. It's almost the same story without some much detailed in-depth sexual content.
B004K98CH0|5.0|This book was visually eye catching due to it's size. It had a nice rythmic pattern, and the kids in my class loved it!
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Fun game to enjoy on your Kindle Fire HD. Fun to play. Fre was even a greater bonus for me.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I can't figure out why The Dark Knight Rises drew such negativity; my family and I all thought it was an excellent ending to this chapter in the Batman saga. Nothing may ever be as good a superhero film as The Dark Knight; if I could, I would give that film 6 stars compared to 5 for this one and the first, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />I did not see this in the theater and in fact watched this video copy on my crappy old TV (we have since gotten a better old TV, HD now, so I will be watching this again). Watching on a small screen focuses you on the story and the actors and less on the effects, and I think that served this film well. Given that this is comic book material, I can forgive most logical gaps as we are frequently called upon to do with these types of films. It is also very dark, but not out of context for this film series or the times we live in.<br /><br />I had been concerned that covering the face and masking the voice of an actor as fantastic as Tom Hardy would ruin the film, and it is a role a lesser actor could have handled, but Hardy still manages to own Bane's physicality and sheer fright factor. Christian Bale seemed to do better in this role -- he does suffering very well -- than The Dark Knight, where he seemed uncomfortable at times until the end, upstaged entirely by Heath Ledger. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a few annoying Boy Scout moments, but he's always such a joy to watch that really didn't matter.<br /><br />If you need convincing to watch this film, you might enjoy it better than the over-critical, over-anxious fanboy crowd. It's not the Avengers, for sure, but it slides in nicely for the now, sadly, completed Christopher Nolan-Batman endeavor.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The very first thing you see on the screen is a woman's breast, then you get to watch the woman walk around naked for the first 5+ minutes of the show. The film then turns into a F-bomb dropping advocate for drugs and alcohol usage. The characters have NO redeeming qualities. After the first ten minutes you hope for someone to like or even care about to show up in the film...Don't hold your breath. After twenty minutes, and the film still not getting interesting-I mean I didn't even care what happened to the guy or anyone else in the film-we walked out. This was the first film I have ever walked out of at the theatres, and that is saying a lot!!<br /><br />If you like watching cheap naked woman, using drugs, hearing the F-bomb A LOT, and characters that you don't care about with a story, that could be interesting but isn't, then by all means watch this movie.<br />But if you have any intelligence in your head and/or any amount of morals and virtue, then this is not the movie for you. ( I know it has Denzel - I mean that is why I went to see it! Sorry)
B004JN1D2I|2.0|then the author loses control of the narrative / characters, and the charm of the early books disintegrates. The part where &#34;Dragon princess&#34; buys her eunuch army and the event that follows is utterly ridiculous and implausible within the story's framework. Read the first book, maybe the second and stop.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This is a classic that everyone should read!  It is not necessarily an easy read though, but well worth it!
B0055PGUYU|2.0|This is a good example of what would be a good magazine feature being unnecessarily expanded into a book. Certainly, parts are interesting, but those parts could be summarized more succinctly and concisely .
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Richard Castle is a fine writer not too much filler just the right mix to enjoy every page. I will continue to read his offerings.
B0046ECJBY|4.0|A rather glowing view of China, and especially Mao. No doubt the Party is pleased with this book, as it's significantly better than anything its own propaganda units could produce. Despite this criticism, I definitely think it's worth reading and not without merit in some respects. Often, too many Western books demonize China and lack perspective.
B009NRO5XE|5.0|I love new release Tuesdays, and I love them even more when they give me something so rare!  I picked up this album on vinyl and it caught my ears right from the get go.  I still buy a lot of old 78's in current times, so to have a NEW record come out that is geared toward the sound of those old records (minus the excess pop's and clicks), it's pure genius to say the very least.  I've played the heck out of my vinyl copy since I bought it, so no doubt mine will have the sound of dust and pop's not too long from now, lol.<br /><br />The compositions are all beautifully orchestrated on this LP.  It's clear that Ferry spared no expense to make this album come together the way it did.  I adore the attention to detail on some cuts with how you can hear that slightly 'clipped' sound from some louder instruments since it was said to be recorded much the way they did back in the day (full band in one studio room with mics placed appropriately).  Also the label looks very &#34;78rpm-esque&#34;.<br /><br />What I would have loved is a special collectors edition with 6 or 8 of the cuts pressed to classic 78's.  This would have been an AMAZING option that I would have bought in a heartbeat.  I can just picture them in one of those classic 78 book style releases.<br /><br />Bottom line here is I cannot stress enough how amazing this album is, regardless if you are simply a fan of jazz and/or Roxy classics you will love this!!  If you are like me and stuck in a time warp of music from the very early 1900's then this is the album for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is incredable it is better than temple run. Me and my friends compete to see whk can get the highest highscore. I play it everyday and i cant stop playing. ;)
B00846REIS|5.0|WAY WAY WAY BETTER the 50 shades! I can not wait till the 3rd one comes out in May/June!<br />I will read them all over again & again!!!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I have read the books and seen all the movies and I have to say I was not prepared for for what I saw.  IT WAS GREAT.  It had one of the most disturbing villians I have seen in any movie in a long time and the actions seens were almost to big for the screen.  I have read some of the back story of James Bond, but this was a well written and acted story from Bond's childhood.  I am sorry I rented it and did not buy it for my digital library, it would have been the first one I did.  Don't hesitate to watch this, you will not be sorry if you enjoy a great story, great action and James Bond.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was OK. Maybe it was just not my kind of book. It took me forever to read it. It did not get good till the last couple chapters. Still going to see it at the movies!
0120884674|5.0|easily carried into the field, this tough manual may also be excellent bedside reading for medical students who will benefit from better knowing the framework to which the rest of us are attached
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Although I saw this movie many years ago, I still enjoyed watching it again, particularly hearing the voice of Whitney Houston.
B007NVIB5U|5.0|Wwish i could find the us version love tthis. Stewart  Brian and Nathan my favorite trio just wish there was more episodes
B008MG1E4A|2.0|After so much hype about this event, this author did a very poor job of explaining why he felt such a need to write about this.  I felt that he betrayed out country.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|The option for discreetly moving a console and monitor in andout of.... Say...work for an example. High quality, nice screen, organized. I've been using mine for two years now. Religiously. I love it.
B000IY03CS|5.0|George Michael has stated that he makes his music today for the fans he had in his hey-days (like me). He doesn't make his music for any of the newer fans, basically. I enjoyed all three discs, as it did take me way back to another time while still enjoying the present. The versions of the songs are great also. The only one song that I could think of that should've made this phenomenal collection is \\"Soul Free\\", of the Listen Without Prejudice Vol I album. And, perhaps \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\", off the same album; originally a Stevie Wonder song.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|great movie to bring back past times. younger children should watch this instead of the crap they watch nowadays. great buy!
B007V693YK|1.0|I love this online but this app is as bad as all people say It freezes doesnt work if<br />I could get a refund I would be happy but this is just terrible I bought it because some guy said it was updated its NOT stay away from this app spend the extra and get ultimate guitar tabs
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think its SUPER fun and teaches you alot about horses! I play this game like everyday and love it so far! anyone who loves horses would live this game too!
B007QUUIEA|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a very interesting and exciting book. More fitted to teenagers to young adults. I certainly enjoyed it as I am 16.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is an enjoyable pass time.  I love puzzle but since it is on the kindle instead on a table it is easier to use.
B00991TCOG|5.0|The CD is excellent.  Lindsey has so much talent.  I haven't stopped listening to her.  Hope there are more to come.  Thanks Amazon!!
B004JVXTL8|1.0|I think really scary movies are as hard to make as really good comedies. This was so predictable that it seemed difficult to watch.
1250027624|5.0|Being a total Downton Abbey found , I found this to be a most delightful companion to the series.  Long may Downton Abbey be around.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Karl Urban is really good, but the production value of this was a 4 out of 10. My teen sons loved it! But, typical dark future slums - ala Robocop, which I detested. Somehow, I have more hope for mankind.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It's ok I mean you can't log in or have subscriptions it's just not the thing for me but you might like it
B0040GR01M|5.0|Every song is a good song not jsut a crap CD with a single on it. Great price for a great cd.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so good it's child friendly and also fun for adults I suggest this game to you if you have a Facebook you can earn more coins by logging in I like it and I'm picky with games
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I watched the movie first and then got the books.  Wish i would have did it in reverse order.  If you liked the movie you have to get the books
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've always liked Nicolas Sparks' books but I'm always disappointed when the character he's written so well that I really know & like him dies.Always try the next book in hope that it wont happen.I didn't cry this time !
B004XDYJRU|4.0|What's not to like about TuneIn Radio. Keeps me connected to stations far and wide, especially international stations. The recording feature is also a nice bonus.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I had finally made level 58 then the game glitched and started me over from level 1. Definitely upset. Was ready to uninstall until the folks at the customer care center got involved and fixed me right up. Was Leary at first but they did come through. I love the game. Very addictive. And the customer service actually does their job. Thanks again for taking care of my issue in a timely manner.
0596009208|5.0|This is great book for beginners and also for intermediate level programmers to learn a brain friendly way to Java.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Seems to be a good enough game but moves too fast for someone my age with less than optiimal dexterity
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was very funny and I can't wait for the next book.<br />Diary of a Wimpy Kid books are awesome .
B000YDE4HS|4.0|I've been a fan of Timberland's shoes for a while.  This was my first pair of boots for them, though so I wasn't sure how they would feel compared to their other shoes.  After wearing them for a few months now I'm a big fan, liking the rugged look and quality of them.<br /><br />The leather when you first get them is quite stiff, but after a day or two of just walking around it breaks in very nicely.  It has a good thick, quality feel to it. The internal lining isn't very thick so these would be best for cool to moderate climates (not extreme colds). The bottom of the soul has good traction which is part of what I was looking for (I live in a area that's cool wet and slick for a good part of the year). If you need arch support in your shoes or like a very cushy soul though you'll want to add inserts to these (which I don't need, but would have liked to see in order to give the product 5 stars).
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|I expected this movie to be non-stop action without much plot.  I was pleasantly surprised that the movie had a plot to match its action.  It tugged at your heart strings in several places.  I think both men and women would find this movie enjoyable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very well developed and written. Enjoyed thoroughly. Loved how the different lines of the story came together.... And of course Holder!!!!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|inlove this series I cant wait till I get the rest of them another one we cant stop whatching .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So much fun<br />This game is a lot of fun . For any age too. The picture quality is excellent as well
B0021L9MJG|5.0|One of my all time favorites, with great actors and stories I remember from the original magazine 50 years ago. I bought this version because some mean spirited SOB borrowed mine and didnt return it!<br />The Crate is my best pick with Fathers day following close behind.<br />I was disapointed that the Blu ray vertion didnt have any out takes such as the Classic &#34;I've forgotton my lines Richard&#34;! gurgled from a dead and waterlogged Ted Danson to a terrified Leslie Nielson in something to tide you over. Steven King was pretty good as well but looked a bit like he was wearing in a Ghillie suit at the end of his skit.<br />I still use the Line &#34;What are friends for&#34;? in conversation today
B00B2064IY|4.0|Interesting for Hendix fans. Good sound and rare version of known songs, but is very interesting. Is a good CD better then other compilation of new material. In reality are studios pre versions of famous songs. The difference are the musicians. Is a period when Hendrix pay with the Experience but prepare the new change with Band of Gypsies. Excellent solos, and more important, you can hear where Jimi want to go. Essential for Hendrix fans or rock music specialist.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|So funny the talking cat. I forgot to turn it off and had it in my bag it was picking up others conversation you can imagine the looks I got. Now there is talking cat 2 with a dog.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I LOVE this movie!!!  It is a typical Hitchcock in that it starts out slowly, introducing all of the characters and giving some background into their lives and how they came to be in their current situation.  The suspense builds slowly with just enough information for you to paint the picture in your mind.  The cast of characters is AMAZING.  James Stewart, Raymond Burr, and Grace Kelly all play their respective parts with elegance and believeablilty.  Definately one to own and watch over and over.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Nothing can make me laugh so much as this show does . The characters and the writing connect every single time
B005LAIH4A|4.0|This is a fun movie based on the original show.  It really emphasizes the need to take more responsibility for our world.  I really enjoy the Grammy character.  She makes me laugh.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Definitely is a lot better than I first thought it would be. If you like Family Guy at all you will enjoy this.
B00AEFY3DQ|3.0|I enjoy this movie because of the knock off qualities.  I grew up watching Star Trek with my parents, and then The Next Generation as I entered college.  I find this movie fun and entertaining, yet just the right amount of cheesey.
B00B3EV8IU|5.0|IMHO, this is easily Robben's best work since Talk To Your Daughter. Playing is smooth and inventive. Plenty of drool-worthy riffs here, but Robben also displays a musical maturity that wasn't always present in TTYD. He really makes room for the stellar ensemble to shine. Worry not - there's plenty of space left for Robben to do his thing. Really one of the better albums I've heard the last few years.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Great cast and good acting, along with beautiful photography.  Interesting story line.  I had no idea it would end the way it did.
B008220C38|1.0|I viewed about 20 minutes of this travesty and then not only stopped watching, but destroyed the dvd.  My expectations for a credible dramatization of one of the greatest masterpieces of fiction were admittedly high, but this artsy, silly caricature was so deficient in overall approach and attitude that I was sickened.  I wasted money on the dvd, but absolutely refused to waste further time.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a great app. works lerfect at giving you a snapshot in to your account. only one thing i would change and that is being able to see the number of views per item.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Although I may be a guy, I do enjoy books by Nicholas Sparks from time to time aside from my Testosterone series like Game of Thrones recently. I must admit that this book really captivated me and got intrigued and curious for more after every chapter. My honest opinion, is that this is the best book hes ever written. I mean it actually gave me chicken skin as I read the final chapters. You have to give this a try! There's a reason why it has been gathering such high ratings and comments!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the very best books I have ever read! Honestly, anything Colleen Hoover writes is perfection. I will forever be a fan. I adore and love all her books. This book is absolutely amazing! If you have not read this book, read all the five star reviews and ignore the rest. 5++ stars
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Didn't have the impact on me as the first three books. It is not holding my attention like they did.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theater and I am thrilled to be able to watch it at home at will.  Charming as always, with adorable secondary characters and sappy romance deluxe!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have tried many keyboard apps and I got to say that this is one of the most refined keyboard app available out there. It's not exactly perfect as I can still see some bugs or wrong words sometimes. But overall this is one of your best alternative keyboard. I have recommended this app to my friends and most of them loved it better than the original keyboard.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. is back!  I was always impressed with his talent.  This role showcases his skill quite nicely!  I find both Holmes and Watson completely likable and they mesh very well as the investigative team they are.
B003L77TZI|4.0|I was very pleased with how quickly I received my order, but was a little disappointed to see that it had a crack on the casing (as it was described as new and in perfect condition)
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|I loved the book and I was not disappointed by the movie.  It followed it quite well in my opinion.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|SLOW moving and predictable but it was okay and entertaining for a while.  I like Harrison Ford, but this was NOT his best effort
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This movie is a terrific second part to a (hopefully) long-lived saga!  Moriarty was not what I had expected but he was serviceable enough.  The filming techniques did more to cement the bond between Holmes and Watson, as well as the quirky workings of Sherlock's mind.  His brother was a fabulous light touch of whimsy and Watson's bride is perfect to deal with both Watson AND Holmes in future!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|While it is a low budget series, it is still fun carrying along the old sici-fi fun of yesterday.  The plots are predictable but it still provide wonderful excapism!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I thought this was a fitting end to this particular incarnation of the Batman.  The acting was convincing and the story line was interesting.  I always enjoy some humor in my movies and the touches were well-timed and witty.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I just love this movie.  Very funny.  My entire family will sit and watch this one.  Handles the difficult issues well.
1416550534|5.0|This is well-written and the author does an excellent job of going back and forth in time from the old woman in the present to the young servant in the past. She ( Ms Morton) knows just how many clues/foreshadowings to give you to keep you on top of the plot and hungry for more story.  I loved it.
B004KPLVV8|4.0|This was primarily purchased for my husband and kids.  It brought back so many memories for my husband.  It is well done, and fun to watch
B00BBW15R8|5.0|I like this movie because it really gets the heart. Watching someone that has been very hardened by the system and is just going through life change throughout this movie was very touching.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|It never ceases to make me smile.....  or bring tears to my eyes.  What a wonderfully gifted actor Dustin Hoffman is
1607066017|5.0|I had heard a little of the buzz on this series over the past year, and being a fan of Y: The Last Man, I figured that I had to give this a shot.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect, other than what some of the other reviewers had noted, that it was somewhat like a more mature sci-fi epic - an R-rated Star Wars.<br /><br />Saga, Vol. 1 is terrific!  Indeed, there are many mature themes, violence and nudity, but they all make sense within the context of the story and I don't feel like any of it was that gratuitous.  The story revolves around star-crossed lovers from two warring worlds and species, and their attempts to escape multiple antagonists, all the while protecting their hybrid infant daughter.  Almost all the characters are given some degree of nuance and sympathy, even the antagonists, which include a &#34;robot&#34; prince (that apparently looks and procreates like human, except these robots have televisions for heads), and a couple of bounty hunters.<br /><br />I was not quite expecting such a strong fantasy aspect to this sci-fi series, but hey, if we can believe in The Force and Lightsabers in a Galaxy Far Far Away, then why not take it a step further and have sci-fi along with magical spells, swords, and ghosts (come to think of it, Star Wars has most of these too).<br /><br />I was not familiar with the artwork of Fiona Staples, but she is amazing!  The characters all look pretty unique and her designs are excellent.  Also, the expressiveness of the characters greatly expands the storytelling in a way that's certainly a strength of the comic book medium.  I am really looking forward to the next volume and may have to start collecting the individual Image issues if it doesn't come out soon!
0694524441|2.0|I know many love this book, but I did not. I found it to be tedious and annoying, trying really hard to sell an idea that I'm not buying.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is funny since it's a scenario that could actually play out - minus the wealth of the male character!  Fun read.
B004ZG5F0K|1.0|I was not able to see until this week and I was unable to see it as all the time stop this is the second time I have problem with amazon as now before I order I have to be sure I have to see the movie before the time for return expire and some time I am not able as only see the movies when I have time or if I order for some one else I have to wait until they see to return.
B0015AARJI|4.0|It's a new PS3 controller, so the buttons are a little firmer.  My one wish is that Sony could make more quality joysticks like Microsoft puts on the XBox, or even 3rd party companies put on their controllers.<br />After a week of playing, I can almost rattle them around.
0671449028|5.0|My son is 2 years old and he has loved this book since he was a baby.  I have a copy from a gift set from 2 years ago that was made in China, and I just bought this copy for part of a shower gift (March 2013) and it's Made in the USA! I love items made in the USA and I try to avoid things made in China.  It's hard to find out where books are made from Amazon sometimes, so I wanted to let everyone know.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It takes some time to get a hang of the game but once you do you are hooked onto this game...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Just amazing and download it I have it on my iPod and kindle fire to. I be on it as all day long!!!
B002ZG98UA|3.0|It shipped really fast but I didn't get it very fast.  Even though I did get it before the deadline.  Also, no tracking information available.  The case was cracked and the dvd had a scratch on it.  The dvd case wont even close.  So, not going to use this company again.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|Worth the wait. Love everything about it, powerful, thought provoking and always, always BR is intelligent.They simply get better each album.
B0058VW36U|4.0|A fun when you have just a few minutes to wait. Like in a doctors office with the sound off.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I was extremely impressed with this game. And it has a lot of features that you wouldn't expect with a free game. I also like the social aspect. To a lot of social games are aggravating because you can't move forward without friends. But in this game you can move forward with or without friends. Overall lots of fun!
B000FBJG04|5.0|A great read, couldn't put it down. This group of men endured more than we will realize. I THANK YOU FOR MY FREEDOM.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG! That's all I can say. I still have a few more pages to read but I couldn't wait to tell people to read this book. Humor, romance, pain, tenderness, love, affection, anger, etc. Every emotion you can think of is in this amazing book. Unfortunately, I believe a lot of people, too many, can identify with Sky and her life. We need more people in this world like Holder, what a great person he is. These characters are so believable I would swear I know them personally and want to know what happens next in their lives. Please read this book, you won't be disappointed.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie is action packed and has a lot of stars in it. I would highly recommend it if you like action movies. It does use a lot of profanity so not for the young...
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|I really likes this movie.  I could relate to her feelings.  She was a woman with dignity and honor and expected that from all that were aroound her or that touched her life or family.  Unfortunately the world did a radical change and she was not ready to experience it.  Her disdain for Diana was something that she couldn't even understand herself and therefore she wanted to not acknowledge it or her. To her Diana was out of sight so she was out of her mind.  In the movie she appears to be cold and callous but as it goes on you begin to see her soften.  She is in a position that she was groomed for so change is slow and painful.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|A family caught in a web of entaglement experiences life altering events. Intriguing! I liked the PG-13 rating--the movie was not overly violent.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very cool almost like working with a real horse I like the game very much it's a lot of fun
B001BR5NN0|1.0|I don't know what I ever liked about this movie. It sucks. Wish I had not rewatched it especially with my teen kids.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I like the fact you can create different books for alot of things, choosing your own cover is a plus
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I have been waiting for Netflix or Amazon to add this show.  Always heard it was great and now I can verify that.  I have only watched two episodes but I plan on watching them all.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I was given a copy by the author.<br /><br />I read Her Sweetest Downfall which is a prequel to The Forever Girl.  I liked it so much that I emailed the author.  I read A LOT.  So, it is not always easy for me to find a story that is unique and enthralling.  This author has managed to do both.<br /><br />Sophia is a practicing Wiccan who seems to have death following her.  All she wants is a normal life and with the steady buzzing of voices in her head, it doesn't seem to be happening.<br /><br />Charles is a studly sexy paranormal that makes me laugh and eases the life or death attitude that Sophia has.<br /><br />Since I had read the prequel it was awesome to be able to connect some dots.  The depth of all of the characters was amazing.  I studied Wicca when I was younger and after I read this story I contacted some friends of mine that still practice.  I had to share with them how amazing her writing is in regards to accuracy.<br /><br />I was heartbroken for Ivory but at the same time you could see the crazy once it was revealed.  Take a chance on this amazing author.  I promise you will not be disappointed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This a great app...  It's fun for all ages... I recommend it highly. Some levels are a little difficult but still fun...
B008JFUTUY|2.0|If you're just looking for an overly fawning, slow documentary this is the one for you...I enjoy his music and am happy for Rodriguez he is finally getting his due, but this movie plays it like he is the second coming ...
B007B6VOG0|3.0|The songs that the radio plays are good. Beyond the recognizable tunes, the rest is mostly decent background music. If it wasn't so cheap, I'd be upset.
B008OHV4PG|2.0|Never made it through the whole film even though we are both big Neil Young fans....BORING and not terribly entertaining
B001J9EHSC|4.0|This album is so 90s and I love it. I still know every word and it is classic Fiona. Worth it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a sweet, poingant story that engages the reader right from the first page.  The storyline is artfully crafted so that one forgets the story is being told by the dog.  The ending is highly entertaining, and even though it comes as a surprise, it really isn't.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not only is it pornography but it has no plot so you have to be a moron to read this book.  I can't believe i wasted my time
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Cute movie with somewhat of a perdictable plot.  A couple funny parts, but most of them you would have seen in trailers for the movie.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The story is simple, yet complex and interwoven. Easy to follow, yet unable to predict the next move, it is a game of chess that has all the rules of checkers. It's one of the best stories I've ever read.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I'm anxious to get my book finished. The process to format for the Kindle sounded complicated. After reading this, I'm pretty confident that I can do it. This is very easy to follow, and well written.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really liked the book.  I was interested from the start.  I watched the movie after I finished the book and I wished I hadn't.  The book was way more involved and had a lot more detail.  I would recommend it for sure.
B0051T46XM|4.0|This movie appeared out of nowhere and I'm certainly happy that it did. The plot is original and engaging, and the characters are likable and realistic. I originally watched this on Netflix Streaming and liked it so much that I HAD to have my own copy. Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Extensively supported by references if one wants to check. Having lived through the times the revelations do shatter one's illusions but one should know that the philosopher/ thinker and the politician are two separate creatures. Nixon probably comes out best,surprisingly.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The title of this review is a reference to my feelings on the movies themselves, not on this blu ray set. I think you know what I mean. The transfers are gorgeous and the supplemental information is deep and involving. If you're a fan of Indiana Jones, this is THE set to own. The packaging is solid and well designed, the art pops, and 3 out of 4 of the films are classics. This is a no-brainer, put it in your cart, I'll wait.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading &#34;Wherever You Go&#34; again!  It is wonderful to now own the Kindle version to be able to reference other works!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Gorgeous restoration and transfer. The colors pop in ways that they haven't since the 50's. Between the timeless story and the work that went into this blu ray, I can't recommend it enough. If you have children, or just crave a stroll down memory lane, you need to have this on your shelf.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I cannot say enough about this wonderful book!  This book was extremely well written and a pleasure to read!  Thank you Ms. Morton!
B007KUFDBY|5.0|This is a review of a blu ray, so I must acknowledge that Disney did a fantastic job with the audio and video transfers. This movie looks and sounds absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Now, the plot... Not so good. It's a strange futuristic take on Treasure Island. Some parts fit beautifully, while others feel shoe-horned in. As far as characters go, the real highlight is the dynamic between Jim and Long John Silver. That should come as no surprise if you're familiar with any version of Treasure Island. If you're a fan of the story and don't mind some silly adolescent humor and voice acting, give this a whirl.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is GREAT! I haven't been able stop playing since i got it! GREAT GREAT GAME! I LOVE IT!!
B0089AD8IO|3.0|Do you remember your first Doctor?<br /><br />In 2005, with not much by way of budget, the BBC unleashed the Doctor on the world after a many years absence. The series starts rough, but by the end, as the pieces fall into place, you'll realize that the ride was completely worth it.<br /><br />To answer the question above, Eccleston was my first Doctor, though not my favorite. Give this a whirl to see why (and make it the first stop to the rest of your Doctor Who collection).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. I have always wanted a person horse, and with this app, it feels like I finally have one.
0345803507|5.0|Already had this series on my Kindle. Bought them for my boyfriend who was curious. Needless to say he was hooked.
0307594165|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was for a book club.  Everyone there seem to like it, thought some parts of it was deep.
8866131121|5.0|I love this little planner-from the tiny hidden pocket in the back, to the full page for each day of the year! Fantastic! Lots of room to write!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The movie is awesome but I did not give it a 5 star because I think Amazon should be a litte more gentle with their prices. You know what I mean?
0790731509|5.0|Great movie and it arrive on time. good to do business  with. I will order other CD and DVD's when I need them.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Great movie which I just bought for my three-year old.<br /><br />At first she was not too happy about the monsters but once Boo showed up it was all good.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I always enjoy a main character as bright and compelling as Kvothe. I usually never spend more than two dollars on an e read but this one was defiantly worth it.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My three year-old loves this movie.<br /><br />She knows some of the songs like &#34;Mother knows best&#34; lol<br /><br />and stuff like that. I would recommend it if you can download to your device and keep it in a movie library.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This a great book - 5 stars. A classic book for all. I read  it in High school and college... and now again.
B0060CX8F6|3.0|So my 3 year-old thinks its ok. I bought her Tangled and she loved it. So I figured that Tiana would be similar but no.I am not sure what it is but she seems like have not appreciated this story much. Either way I bought Monster, Inc. and she seems to really like it.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Not the best Bond but worth seeing. Story line was weak. Daniel Craig didn't seem to be at his best & is starting to look tired. His role in casino royal was the best.
0800141660|5.0|Movie is great and I love the actors in it! Jane Austen is awesome and so is this movie! :)
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Great story based on an infamous gangster, favorite actors & good director. A true classic for many years to come.
B00005MP58|5.0|Movie is great and I love the actors in it! Jane Austen is awesome and so is this movie! :) Best version ever!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think you need to lower your games more!!!!!!!!!!! I like it but it was expencive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!what do you rate this game????<br /><br />  love<br />  jello
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|A really great series if you are in to turn-of-the-century English aristocratic lifestyle!  Great story lines and the actors, particularly Maggie Smith, really bring the characters to life.  Looking forward to season 4!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Best rip off yet and world craft is 2 best I like it but the full version is better it's ok I guess
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is another awesome read by Nicholas Sparks!  I have such a hard time finding a stopping point in all his books!  Just like each of Sparks  books it was the best!<br />Now I plan to rent the movie!  Hope it does the book justice!
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|Excellent product if you have a 3rd gen. iPod that has a firewire cable and have a newer MacBook Pro. Lost all my music and with this product I was able to get all my music back.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|It's transformers, so it's hard to go wrong. More of the same from this title.  Not horrible, not spectacular.  Just a fun movie to watch.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is a great case for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. It fits well, and the case is well constructed. It will protect the Kindle with no problem. I like the strap that holds the cover closed, not that it stays open. And you can also use it to hold the case open. I wasn't sure how I would like watching a show, TV or movie on a 7&#34; screen, but setting it on my lab with headphones, it wasn't bad. I was surprised it didn't seem to bother me. While my Grand kids have the TV, I can watch this with Amazon Prime, Netflix, or whatever. I guess I'm getting on about the Kindle, but the case is well worth the price, which is a good price anyway. Definitely recommend with 2 Thumbs Up.<br /><br />Also, some people talk about how to insert it in the case. As noted other places, the proper way to hold the Kindle is with the camera to the left. This is how I have it inserted in the case so the audio, volume controls and power switch are at the top. This also leaves the ports accessible when the case is closed. When you run an App that automatically loads in landscape mode, you may have to hold it upside down. It's not the Kindle, it's the way the App is written.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a very balanced documentary about food production. It does not offer you any medical knowledge but a general approach to how food production impacts our lives and health. Very nicely done, entertaining and informative. Bravo, bravo, bravo.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Good book :) i couldnt put this down. Well worth the year long wait. Im actually sad that this series ended.
B000025XKM|5.0|This album is by far one of the best ever made. I find myself just stuck in his words. And his guitar skills are not to be questioned. If your looking for some music that will be a comforting best friend look no where else.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Always enjoy bond movies but I had missed the last few, so I was curious to see it's evolution. In keeping with the 50th anniversary of bond movies, 007 as a person is aging as well in the movie, realistic and well handled as far as you can push a concept like that in this genre,.<br /><br />Well done, at times too predictable but after all, this is Bond...
B005TVYVI2|5.0|this little tool helps me to focus my swim stroke (both form and rate).  I have found my comfortable stroke rate and do drills at a faster rate, keeping is smooth and steady.  I am using drills from the Swim Smooth book that feature the TTP.  I expect to speed my stroke rate to a more efficient speed with this tool.  It is surprising that such a simple thing as setting a tempo can help me focus on form and improve my stroke.  It works, I'll take it.<br /><br />The beep is not-at- all rasping or too loud.  It is just a steady, rather quiet beep.  Swimmers who are sharing a lane with me cannot hear it.<br /><br />This is how I use it now, though I expect it's use to change over time.  I set the beeps per second that I want then slip it under my cap at the back of my head, between my goggle straps (buttons facing out).  When the time comes to turn it on or change the bps, I can find the right buttons without taking it out.  I also use it to count the number of seconds I hold my stretches.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is my first kindle so l wanted to be sensible about my purchases.  The battery pro has been a great aid in keeping an eye on my usage and charging.  Once I get an understanding of my use patterns I will probably use it less but for now it's a great tool.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Puzzles are great for any age person.<br />They are quick to complete and increase in skill level.<br />More games can be purchased if you want them.
1455883654|4.0|The concepts in this book are amazing.  The book is a little slow in some places but overall one of my all time favorites for making me see things the way they really are in the world.  EVERYONE should read this (or listen as I did) at some point in their life.  Sooner the better.
B004TI5N38|4.0|This book was a good read, and very fast paced! It's hard to put down once you start it! Baldacci  delivers yet again!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Talk about twists and turns. This season has them all. I can't wait to see what happens in the coming season!
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|'Nuff said...<br /><br />Well, I wanted to say &#34;nuff said&#34; but the program here didn't permit me. But that's all I wanted to say...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am enthrallrd by this series.  I was late coming to it, but watched all three seasons in one week.  Wonderful characters...upstairs and downstairs.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all 3 books twice and I have never done that.  I love Fifty.  I would really love to see the 3 books again but from his perspective like you have at the end.  I am begging.
B008X6N1OA|2.0|I am very disappointed that the 3D disk would not work at all.  Had to watch this movie using the Blue=Ray copy.  All my other 3D movies work on my new 3D DVD so  the disk is defective.  Think twice before you decide to order this movie in 3D.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Astounding.  It took a few episodes but then I was hooked.  Can't wait until Season 2 and then Season 3!
B00BETX5PS|1.0|I predict that this will be the last 007 movie unless most people have a vastly different view of what entertainment is supposed to be.  Practically no story line or plot, acting is medicore, very predictable.  Some parts are very boring, and the special effects scenes are overwhelming.  Most of the earlier 007 flicks have been very good.  Bring back Pierce Broson or Sean Connery and I may watch one, but not this guy.  Even the &#34;Bond Women&#34; were a bust.  If I had paid full fare at a theater to see this, I would be very dissapointed.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Using Amazon Instant Video to watch this laugh out loud series.  So much fun.  I watched the first six episodes on my recent plane trip and the time flew by!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|We bought a Blu-ray set for us and a DVD set to share with family etc who don't have blu-ray. There aren't all the extras -- it's just the movies, by and large.  Again, getting it all together in one case per set is great!
B0047WJ12K|3.0|Concept is great. But too difficult to follow.  Not a sitback and relax movie, but does not leave you on the edge of your seat.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|not bad for free. like that it doesnt take to much time to learn like some others. Why do you have to write a set number of words in a review?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am not a huge fan of all the ads that pop up, but good game especially if you are looking for something super addictive...
B00AA0TZTW|1.0|Does Janie Hendrix really need MO' MONEY at the expense of the most influential guitarist in rock history? Guess so. As a lifelong Jimi fan who bought first pressing vinyl in the 60's and the barrel bottom scrapings in the 70's this release is insulting! Does she really want me / us to believe they just &#34;found this treasure trove&#34; of forgotten / misplaced studio takes 45 years later? Gimme a break!<br /><br />I was hoping against hope that they really, REALLY had something new, different and fresh this time but alas more of the same old crap. Maybe worse. My lo-fi worn out bootlegs are still more enjoyable. I used to consider myself a lifelong, gotta hear everything Hendrix fan. No more! Not after this dung!<br /><br />If Janie Hendrix wants to make money and keep Jimi's fans happy maybe she should look through some old concert footage and seriously consider some sort of remastered, updated sound type of dvd thing. At least you'd get to see the master at work. Save your money kids. I think Jimi would have smashed his guitar over Janie AND Eddie Kramers heads if he were alive today!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Action, drama, and zombies! What more could you want in one show! The family doesn't miss a Sunday!! Each week gets better and better and the action never a stops!
0066620996|5.0|One of the best business books ever written. It provides a real and helpful framework. Totally recomendable for business and life.
B00846F1YW|3.0|... IF you only want to test it before purchasing.<br /><br />I was just starting to think it may potential. I wasn't totally convinced.<br /><br />  then..<br />The must purchase message popped up.<br /><br />My advise is to prepare to delete the free version VERY soon.<br /><br />  OR<br /><br />Just buy it.  Your choice.  .. .. .. (I didn't)
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Really like t his game but definitely wish t here were more ways to earn money. Also what is the point of visiting other parks a t this point? You can't do anything there. Great sound effects t Hough and good graphics.more please
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I loved this book best military book I have ever read, also an at book. It was very good thank you
0307276902|5.0|Loved this book. A must read for alcoholics and families of alcoholics. Author keeps the reader interested. Very hard to put this book down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Highly recommended...wish it had more happiness at end. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the books were written. Happy.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I chose this processor for my now newly built computer after extensive research on Intel's website. I admit I was going to go with a previous generation originally to save some money but found that I needed third generation for my video card to work with the motherboard I chose. I do not regret spending the extra money. In my opinion it performs just as good or perhaps slightly better than the generation one i5 I have. So for the same performance and be able to use the video card I wanted I am all for it. If you are curious of the system specs I used:<br />Intel DZ77GAL-70K motherboard<br />Intel Core i5-3570K processor<br />Antec Three Hundred Illusion Black Steel ATX Mid Tower Case<br />ATI Radeo HD7770 Saphire 100358L<br />Kingston HyperX 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 KHX1600C9D3K2/8GX<br />WD Caviar Black 1 TB Hard Drive WD1002FAEX<br />NZXT Aperture M Internal 5.25\\" Mesh w/ 2x USB 3.0<br />LG Blu-ray Drive UH12LS29<br />Antec EA-650 Platinum 650 Power Supply<br />Windows 7 SP1 64 Bit Professional OEM  (I'm not ready for Windows 8 yet)
0471463396|5.0|It is very a good book I really want, I like it very much. It is well packed and looks nice.
B008HJGPVO|2.0|Three different heads and none of them work w/o<br />banging them on the screen.And forget about<br />sliding across the screen . Very disappointed
B00136Q342|4.0|Interesting that it was recorded at Folsom. Sometimes voices come into the recording about cell block numbers, etc. Johnny's voice is pure as always.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|For business or pleasure, this app is so cool.<br />I have it set up on my smartphone, desktop and Kindle Fire HD 8.9<br />and it's great to be able to shoot a pic with your phone and have it show up on my other two devices.<br />Great for notes on jobsite.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The continuing adventures of the crew and the new group of survivors provide excellent TV.  I'm glad to be catching up.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|When I found this Live Performance at FYE, and Target, it was only a DVD format, not the format I was looking for. So I decided to get this Blu Ray from Amazon, and boy and I glad that I did. The performance, as described on it's title, celebrates the first 25 Years that this Musical had hit the stages, including Broadway. I was surprised to see how popular of a Musical this way, but more surprised when Nick Jonas, one of the Jonas Brothers, took part in this performance.<br /><br />These are the songs I like from this performance; Look Down (the prologue song), Castle on a Cloud, I Dreamed a Dream, Master of the House, and the Epilogue Version of Do You Hear The People Sing. When there was an announcement, after the show, that a Movie Version of the Les Miz Musical was being worked on, I was surprised. A few years later, I saw the Movie with my friend, Sheryll, and it was beautiful, especially with it's New Song which I will not describe the name of; don't want to cause any spoilers.<br /><br />25 Years, and still counting, it is now the year 2013, and I saw the Movie Musical Version, but that's another story. I should've learned about this Musical back when I was still young, but I guess it's never too late to do so. I checked out the 25th Anniversary of Phantom of the Opera after this, but again, that's another story.<br /><br />My vote of five stars for this marvelous performance. Bring THIS home. (No pun intended)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The storyline is fabulous, the resolution at the end of the season emotionally satisfying, and makes you want to immediately go and watch Season 3.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|game works well good graphics simmiler to the other game in the series. easy to play, well worth downloading. get it now
B00979CS50|2.0|That's just my opinion. I'm a respectful fan of much of his work- and while I'm pretty sure him burping into a mayonaise jar is better than most of what passes as &#34;music&#34; out there- Psychedelic Pill is lacking any sort of sustained spark.<br />But jeez...after 40 years of greatness the guy is allowed a clinker every once in awhile.<br />I'll ALWAYS give the great Neil another chance.<br />This one, however, isn't doing it for me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is great fun! You connect the two dots of the same color and no lines can cross. It is challenging and fun and I look forward to playing. Sometimes when I get stuck I put it down for a couple days and then the solution appears. It's great!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Why can't the networks put out shows of this quality?  Most of the time they cancel shows before they have a chance to prove themselves or they run them in bad time slots.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It is great for white noise while sleeping or meditating. There are a lot of different sounds to choose from - more than I expected. The purring cat and crowded city street were unexpected sounds. It continues to play while reading a book or when the kindle goes to sleep. That is a great feature.
B004EPYZUS|2.0|Sorry - was this supposed to be exciting?  Sure, there's action and shooting and running, yelling, fighting, flying, driving, jumping and blowing things up (the Kremlin!  Oh no!  Not the beautiful Kremlin!) but the story just didn't hold much water for me.  Cruise seems like he needs acting lessons.  Now that his pretty smile is fading, there is naught to carry him through.  Seems to me he used to be a better actor.  Not sure what happened, but this movie was boring enough that I paused it a couple of times and went to do something else.
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia is the best way that Nintendo could have celebrated this franchise's 25th anniversary because this book finally uncovers Hyrule's true story and the timeline of The Legend of Zelda, which has been kept secret by it's producers for so long.<br />Definitely, a must-have in every gamer's library.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Very good Dictionary. Speech recognition difficult with Bluetooth, but works better without it. It would be helpful if it gave you word options when you misspell a word instead of showing \\"no match.\\"
1613821670|4.0|Frankenstein seems to me to be a metaphor for the human condition; in that Victor Frankenstein represents how lonely the human condition can sometimes be, and the desire to want to be needed, or wanted within a social group.  Frankenstein's hideous condition makes him unbearable and feared by most; so he is banished into the mountains and unleashes his anger on murdering a few innocent people.<br /><br />I agree with what others have said, in regards to omitting the first four or five chapters if you want to get into the meat of the story; I did not realize as I read this book that the first five chapters were submitted by Shelley later in order for the book to fit in with the times.  It is a solid backdrop at any rate, and the prose in this story is better than most modern fiction.  The author really takes the time to detail and romanticize everything, especially in regards to the relationship between the Creator and Frankenstein.<br /><br />In the end, this book turns out to be more about the human condition than the monster's condition.  Frankenstein seeks his revenge at his Creator for leaving him cold and alone, and without a female companion.  Once Frankenstein gets his revenge by murdering his bride, the Creator treks out into the Alps, determined to seek his revenge.  You find yourself intertwined in this circular conflict.<br /><br />I had to read this for a class I am taking and am glad that I had the opportunity to read this class novel.  Recommended!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this in one day. I stayed up until 7 a.m. reading it and missed both of my law school classes. So worth it!!! Enjoyed this much more than I thought. Honestly, it is a beautiful and powerful story. It is hard to write a review without giving away major spoilers. My advice-just read it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved every episode.  The set and characters are beautiful.  I especially enjoy the way the writers slip in historical facts and information.  More please!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox is really nice for maintaining access to all of my Word documents without carrying my laptop around. I love being able to view them on my tablet, phone, and computer without having to transfer and sync files manually. I would recommend them for anyone who needs access to documents in various places
B007V65R54|5.0|Talks about a lot of important and impactful events and how wrong assumptions and bad predictions based on those assumptions caused some of these huge failures.
0071766588|5.0|This is a very good preparatory material for toefl. I did not need anything else.just follow everything the book tells you to do and you will end up with a decent score!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Must read for anyone who is, or has been in the military. This will bring you back and is definitely an enjoyable read.
B004MYFV0O|5.0|I have tried a few books to learn to draw and many start off all about perspective and complex exercises that left me frustrated.<br />Mark's  creative way of teaching the same concepts made the learning process much more pleasurable. Learning how to shade  gave me instant gratification early on and made me want to do more.  I am currently on lesson 10 and I am looking forward to completing the book.  It's been a good time so far.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|What makes it good? And not bad is, it keeps you on the edge of your seat type film. Who am I to rate? I've been disabled for 3 years now and I am a movie nut. I've seen most of them all. Netflix Amazon Vodo Direct etc, not to mention Redbox. So I may see three movies in a day. It helps to know what I like in order to be fair.Movies that come to mind are , Heat, tombstone, Galaxy quest, Transformers, butter, Bag of hammers, Bridesmaids, Hangover, Knuckles, Food inc, What stays in Vegas, Along came Polly. Love Ben stiller, Owen Wilson, Al Pacino, Jack Nichols, Huge Jackman, etc. I like scify I like Disney. I have a wide range of likes. Shrek, Babe, Mars needs Moms etc etc. If its done well and keeps my interest I will rate it a 3. Starts well and ends bad, (like end of watch) I will still give it a 3. Starts well keeps me in the show and ends well I will rate it a 4. If I don't remember it, then I cant recommend it. I waited for this movie due to the publicity it revived during the Oscars. Not worthy in my opinion.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It too a few pages to get into this book, but once I was hooked there was no putting it down. A very poignant story I highly recommend this as an enjoyable book with some Kleenex required chapters.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|to flimsy and doesn't really do a good clean cut.  It has it's uses but I was better of using my professional tile cutter to cut glass bottles.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|not very good movie. I like musicals but my time would have been better spent watching Grease again instead of this movie.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was a great book love the narrator<br />Every one needs to get this book<br />The author was a genius
B00BHMETKC|1.0|I can't believe that this movie garnered such praise. The story was so boring. Nothing happens and you don't really care about the people in the movie. They try to give you a sense of tension but it does not work. Boo, take back the Oscar.
B000HEVALC|5.0|After seeing the stage play, &#34;Million Dollar quartet&#34; I wanted to hear the original. It is vastly different than the stage play but shows the innocence of the early career of Elvis etc.
B0027MJU00|2.0|that isn't very good. i don't know i can't recommend stuff like this, it doesn't really have that extra something that i like in books.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this book was too filthy.  Should be rated X.  I didn't read the book, only the first few chapters when I found out what it was going to be like.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|i love the story and the characters. it was a very good book. the pacing was good as well. a fan.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|OMG, I first watch Downton 6 months ago just to see what it was all about, but now I am complettly hooked on the cast and the story line. I hate that this season is over already!
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I bought this case after looking at several other manufacturers that had similar cases for a larger amount of money.  I purchased an Amazon Basic product in the past and was satisfied with the quality.  I decided to buy this case.  The quality of the case is outstanding.  The zippers are heavy duty.  The straps and handle look to be built to take abuse.  The case material is sturdy.  It is well padded and just fits my Canon 40d with a telephoto lens that is 77 mm in diameter attached.
145470246X|3.0|I would not recommend this as your first book when you want to learn about building and designing around stones.  I found other books that are better for the beginner when wanting to learn to create dimensional works of art.
076790592X|3.0|good deal for the price, it came in good shape It was nice not to pay A bunch of $$ for a school book.
B008M721MS|2.0|Cant download onto Kindle Fire!!! I wish it would let any face messaging work! THis is why I bought this thing.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|A waste of my money, program wanted to sync and create an account and a few other things I have no use for.<br />Went with another free calender app and is easy to use and save appointments.<br />Wish I could cancel this order, removed from my Kendal Fire after 30 minutes for messing with it.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfer's is a fun and addicting game, that I play almost everyday even if I don't have time. There's so many different characters and every month during the tour you surf somewhere new.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it! I couldn't put it down it was just speechless & I would recommend this to everyone ages from 9-older. Great book!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008476HBM|4.0|Enjoyed this story but after reading more modern stories found the descriptions and dialogues too wordy )If one can say that) and am very pleased that I live in this century.
B004TUKNX6|5.0|Probably Rush's best, although I also think Permanent Waves is up there as well. Remaster sounds even better in my opinion.
0062014536|4.0|REQUIEM is told in alternating chapters from both Lena and Hana's point of view. What ended up surprising me the most about REQUIEM was that even though the Delirium Trilogy has been Lena's story, in this final book, it was Hana's chapter's that I couldn't get enough of. Lena's story continues in the Wilds and focuses on the Rebellion as well as reconciling her feelings for Julian and Alex. Hana's story, for me at least, was the more gripping of the two girls as it follows her, now Cured, preparing to marry the newly elected Mayor.<br /><br />Hana's story feels very much like the first Delirium book. It's sort of like what Lena's life might have been like if she had been Cured and gone along with the life that was planned out for her, despite mounting misgivings. Hana has been Cured and paired amazingly well. Except, her Cure didn't work completely. She's plagued by feelings of guilt and uneasiness. Worse her husband to be is starting to drop the smiling facade he wears on TV and hint about Hana's fate being similar to his mysterious first wife if she steps out of line. Hana begins seeking answers about the first wife and discovers horrific truths not just about her own future, but the plans to eradicate the Invalids and any who are sympathetic to their cause.<br /><br />The Delirium Trilogy has taken it's frighteningly intriguing world where love has been declared a curable disease and followed it's protagonist from a girl terrified of becoming infected by love before she's old enough to be cured-like her mother, through her struggle and ultimate embrace of feelings she'd always considered an illness, to her slow ascension within the ranks of the Rebellion even to the front lines of the final battle. Not all the characters we've come to care about survive, and fewer still emerge unscathed, but Lauren Oliver concludes her lovely and lyrically written trilogy with both promises and hope without eliminating all the uncertainty that realistically remains. I for one will anxiously look forward to seeing how this world and these characters translate to the small screen in Fox's TV adaptation starring Emma Roberts as Lena and Jeanine Mason as Hana.<br /><br />Sexual Content:<br />Kissingl anxiously look forward to seeing how this world and these characters translate to the small screen in Fox's TV adaptation starring Emma Roberts as Lena and Jeanine Mason as Hana.<br /><br />Sexual Content:<br />Kissing
B000W1YYEK|5.0|This was one of my first rock albums I've ever listened to. I was blown away from the first track to the last, back then and now.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I'm not really much of the Sci Fi or out of this world kind of moviegoer so it's okay but the rest of the family does and they would definitely give it a 2 thumbs up.  The DVD was delivered as described by seller, fast delivery.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Awesome show, quality of fm from amazons instant video is great. This is a must see, a showing of history repeating except this outcome is good.
B0050UEVU0|4.0|movie is just ok must keep typing to get enough words for review but getting really really tired too many reviews.  DVD in perfect condition as advertised..
B009JZTOG8|3.0|Season one was better.  It seems like the writers are getting desperate to find to angles and twists.  This show should have been a one hit wonder making us want more instead of wishing we hadn't bought the whole season!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks has away of making you see the characters as if you were right there in the plot. Loving, tense, and tender. A fantastic read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a good game but gets frustrating sometimes it is ok I do enjoy it I like the updates
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is such a good book, right from the start. Couldn't put it down. Wanted to keep reading, but on the other hand didn't want the book to end. Highly recommend it!!!!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Loved the book I usually hate reading. It's a book most should buy. I really enjoyed reading this book. Moving to the next one now.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game. Love earning xp and $ in competitions. Variety of things you can buy to customize your horseand improve your presentation score. Only annoying thing...doesn't always load correctly.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|This movie came to me in new like condition,I remember the first time I watched this movie I wanted one of these creatures,I wanted one for myself.I already knew that it was only a movie but it is a great one to watch and to own.There two of these movies and it is smart to buy both of them.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|a good app however sometimes does not open and does sometimes crash would reccomend to anyone with kindle and good skills
B000067FP8|4.0|I recieved this movie in new like condition.I remember when it came out and I thought it was a great movie then and now I own it.This is another one that belongs in my kouse
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Is it just me, or does he look 12 years old?  Lol!  That deep voice from that little guy is amazing!  This is a wonder CD. Bought it for my hubby, but don't think I haven't swiped it a few times from his truck!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This movie came to me in new like condition.I remember watching this movie in the shows when I was very young.It stood out in my mind then and, it did again when I watched it at home.It is a great movie and I really think all baby boomers would want to own this movie.It is a classic and I am glad to add it to my collection.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|It's not as exciting as the first 3 seasons.  Things are getting a little repetitious with the Cartel and gangs and what not.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey was so good I just couldn't stop watching it.  I was up until 1AM many evenings because I just had to watch one more show.  The set was beautiful, the actors were superb.  I just enjoyed it more than I have words to describe.  I watched it on my Kindle Fire and the small screen did not bother me one little bit.  I used ear phones and it was wonderful!
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|I liked that there were a huge variety of actors in the movie, espechially Ed Norton in comedic role.  Other than that I don't know what to say. It was pretty wacky!
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Game plays well on kindle fire. Stress free and relaxing.  No hidden object screens to strain eyes.  Simple challenges. Tools to solve problems are easily found. You can tap the screen as many times as you want with no penalties. All the hints you need are available in game. There's a map if you need it. I liked it but didn't love it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It is a period piece and leans on magic as the key to its plot. The reader needs to pay attention to the chapter titles and dates because the book goes back and forth in time. The Night Circus is paced nicely with strong descriptive scenes. Character development could be better, but since the story revolves around two primary and two secondary characters, with a cast of tertiary players it worked okay. If you like fantasy books, you'll enjoy The Night Circus.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I'm into science fiction. This book was really good. It was one of those hard to put down books. Can't wait to read more from this author.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a dark book, but it addresses WW II and Nazi invasions, so there is no getting around the dark subject matter. The writing is fantastic, as is the character development and story line. You want everything to turn out rainbows and butterflies, but you know it can't. I'm not a weeping reader, but this book drew tears. Dive in and appreciate the material, root for the main character, and be thankful you won't have to make any of the characters' choices and decisions.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I enjoyed the game very much. I loved it. Fantastic can not get enough of it. Really fun game. Look forward to playing more like it
B003JTHWPA|1.0|This book is the most depressing book I have read in a long time.  you continue to wait for something possitve to happen and more sadness and depression continues.  It was well written but if you are looking for a great read to uplift you during these economic down times to pick up this book.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I've loved everything of ND I've read, and this is no exception. A bit misleading that this book is titled The Panther, because he's really just a supporting player here. But who cares. Make sure you've read Wild Fire before cracking this one open.
B002ZBRSMK|2.0|I thought I would like this movie, since I like sci fi and David Bowie.  However, this was just too weird.  Theme revolved around alien who came to earth and then was analyzed & studied to point of destruction.  Sorry, this movie was disjointed and a hodgepodge of disconnected scenes.  The sex scenes were strange, but not stranger than the movie as a whole.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This sequel to Name of the Wind is just as riveting and enjoyable. I highly recommend it! Go for it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|In light of Chris' death, I decided to read his book.  What a powerful book!  It is one I will read several times.  He pulled the reader into each battle and made me understand something out of my realm of understanding.  He brought humor to the book, sometimes in a very sarcastic way.  The ending tore me to pieces when he talked about when we die and go before the Lord.  I am very sad for his family, losing a wonderful heroic man.  I was addicted to this book and could not put it down.  A best seller in my eyes.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Great writing.  I really enjoyed the open, honest way that Strayed told her personal story.  I was sorry when the book ended.
0765325950|4.0|This book is non-stop action.  Although I think some of the characters are not quite how Jordan would have had them, the interactions are still good.  And the final book is exactly what it should be in that it goes from one crises to the next with no slow pacing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game! It has good graphics. Wide selection of horses. Good equipment, and realistic too.  Love it!
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Thoroughly enojoyed this sequel. The universe of the &#34;Old Man's War&#34; series is a very compelling and I'm looking forward to the possibility of this series coming to the big screen.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren did an excellent job of acting in this movie.  Hopkins certainly had Hitchcock's cadence and mannerisms down pat.  There were some funny lines in this movie too .................  Overall a great movie to watch and good insight into the Hitchcock marriage and the making of Psycho.  In this marriage, it certainly rang true about the 'woman behind the man'.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Enjoyed the book thoroughly. It was well written and had interesting characters. The author has quite an imagination. Definitely put the main character through the ringer
B008I3QZKU|3.0|Maybe not thier best but certainly good enough to warrant a purchase.  If you are not familiar with the group start wtih Sam's Town
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|This book is by far.. Ok<br />I have indeed read Matched and, it was a good read, but Crossed was not her best work. It was slow paced, and lacked the enticement I felt was always was there while reading Matched.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|Agree with other five star ratings for this CD..  Not enough of this kind of out there.  Do yourself and favor and Listen up!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|It was a great gift for my boyfriend, he loved it! The mafia movies were really good & would order more of those.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Bright but lots of ad breaks to get frree game to run.  Explodes, burns bright shiny lights.  Candy colors.  Words required to get out of review so annoying.
B00503BN1M|5.0|A perfect light romance. You know they are going to end up together but watching Ashton Kutcher do his puppy-dog eyes thing is such a delight.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This fabulous trilogy was so exciting I found myself sneaking a passage in during my work day and staying up way past my bed time. What fun! I'm just sorry it's over!
1118273052|5.0|I'm on my third reading of Jack Schwager's masterpiece and I still love it. I will be buying his Hedge Fund Market Wizards next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it was a very fun game to be able to play for free very good graphics and easy to understand
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So nice to access my books from my phone!  I really hate waiting in the dr's office or to pick someone up and having nothing to do, such a waste of time.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its fun and awesome. kind of like instagram but maybe a little better. fun for all ages and is great for retouching pictures
0345803507|2.0|The binding on this book was completely loose with only the back cover staying in place. Trying to hold it while the cover sliding around was very annoying.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game.. very realistic. If you love horses you will definitely love this game<br />#horses #stables #horse game #game #realistic
B009O2XY12|5.0|This is my fav, the only problem is I run out of bubbles too soon, but I really enjoy playing it while watching tv
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've been using this for over a year and it still works great. No double clicking or anything else wrong. Here's my take on it:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Very comfortable. To me this is the most important thing and I've bought 3 mice since owning this and only 1 of them were remotely usable due to comfort. (if you are a right hander, get a right handed mouse (sloped design))<br />Soft touch feel reduces sweating.<br />The thumb buttons are the best I've used. They click perfect and you can reach them all with ease.<br />Software allows remapping all the buttons and there's a macro function (which I use).<br />The wheel has a satisfying slope to it and great feedback with a rubberized touch.<br />Fantastic customer service.<br />Weight tuning.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The laser has a very slight input delay compared to optical. (I don't notice it anymore, but I bought this after using an optical mouse for 2 years and initially thought it was a faulty mouse)<br />The wheel and DPI lights can't be turned off and also don't change color with the main symbol.<br />The right side is a gloss finish, lacking the soft touch.<br /><br />I give it an 8/10.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a gift.  He loves the Rolling Stones, but never saw them like this.  He loved it and I watched it with him and loved it too.  One of a kind show!<br />dlp
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I looked forward to reading every page to see what would happen next.  Pat was the one that I really rooted for.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I enjoy most movies with Denzel Washington in them.  As usual he really captured the part and made you feel what the character was feeling.  The story line was great.  Supporting actors, superb.  I even like the ending and wasn't sure how it was going to end.  I would highly recommend this movie.<br />dlp
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This biography of Abraham Lincoln will grab you from the first chapter, and never let you go!! It brings to life the REAL Honest Abe that  you've never (or at least seldom) met before. Ms Goodwin has definitely done her homework, and includes material and quotes I've never seen in any previous bios. She brings to life the REAL &#34;Honest Abe&#34; because she has taken the trouble to investigate the vast array of material &#34;out there&#34; that is only casually mentioned in other books. Page after page contains actual conversations of Lincoln from quotes, letters, etc., that are part of the historical record (but seldom used) that bring into focus the mind of Lincoln during each event the author is covering, and not just a condensed version or summary or &#34;pick and choose&#34; method sometimes used. Thus, I felt almost as if I were there as a participant, witnessing history in the making, especially during Lincoln's first Presidential campaign. This book is a keeper!!
6305128952|4.0|There was an upsetting scene, that hits you from almost nowhere (sort of unexpected), so I can't give it a 5 star, but all in all it was a pretty good movie.  I'm not sure why they needed a love interest between Robert Redford and Kristen Scott Thomas.  The movie could have survived quite nicely without that additional story line, maybe even better.  About 80% is worth watching, so you have to sit through the 20% that isn't so great.  It's worth it for the rest of the movie.<br />dlp
B006MW3V6U|5.0|You will get so involved in these people's lives you won't want the show to end!  I kept watching episodes until it was over!
B0041KKYDI|3.0|We had to fast forward through some of the gory stuff.  The story was good and Franco was excellent, but just too gory for us.  If you have a weak stomach I would recommend you watch this, but on the other hand if that stuff doesn't bother you, you would enjoy this movie.<br />dlp
B003M0H4OU|5.0|Heard it online and decided to buy it.  I love all the songs . It has a variety of different styles . very pleased
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|Just for Sex and the City fans.  Otherwise it wouldn't have been watched at all.  If it had to stand on it's own, it never would have made it.  I wish the writers would come up with better story lines.  Just put on a fashion show, since that is the best part of the sex and the city sagas.  Maybe then the writers could come up with something better then the plot in this one.  The girls were wonderful as usual and so was the fashion.  But if you're looking for plot, it comes up short.<br />dlp
B00003CXA2|5.0|I like the plot of this movie to show how life is full of surprises . You never know what you going to get .  A must have movie for your DVD collection.
B003Y5H574|4.0|I liked it.  It was cute with some good lines.  I'd watch it again for some light entertainment.  If you aren't looking for anything deep, just some good lines, I would recommend this romantic comedy for a chick flick.<br />dlp
B000JMKNZQ|3.0|If you are a seeker you must read Pablo's work. I love how he writes, as a reader I like how he forces you to critically think about what is currently going on in your life. Over all very well written and good book.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the game.  Love the graphics.  I wish the free game was a little longer.  I just get going really good and then the game is up and you have to buy it.
B007L6VR12|5.0|What can I say. I love this movie. The dialogue is &#34;quirky&#34; and amusing, and the story line just keeps on getting better.  Moonrise Kingdom has a fabulous cast, and each cast member is perfect for his/her role. I am a movie buff, and this was my favorite movie of 2012.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great continuation of the series. Keeps you engrossed the entire time. I had a hard time putting it down because the story never slowed.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|What a treat!  It was charming & delightful. A fairy tale for adults.  Thank you!  Thank you! Thank you!  Yes.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is an excellent start to a series. There is enough detail to get you familiar with the world and characters with enough action to keep you from getting bored. If you've watched the series, you'll love the books even more because of the wealth of information.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This film makes a habit of being over-the-top, and it's entertaining because of it. Highly recommended to everyone who loves a fun flick, but seeing Iron Man and Thor beforehand helps with the storyline.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book. Better than the second one, but as always never as good as the first.  Good read but as expected left you hanging for a follow up book, but still none yet
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read in quite some time. This book brought out a lot of emotions. I  cried, I laughed and cheered Pat on and I have learned it's more important to be kind than to be right.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game and it keeps my child entertained. Only thing is, I wish the nuts were a little easier to gain and buying the land virtually takes an ice age once you've bought up ten property squares.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|I loved this movie as a teen and haven't seen it forever. My oldest kids are now teens and we watrched it together. My son didn't like it so much, but my daughter did.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. It is very easy to use on Sunday and Wednesday at church or for any other time.
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|The characters and the director made a precious job. The music started at the right moments. It is a master piece.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|A delightful story told from the point of view of a severely autistic young boy. Full of pathos and humor, providing a possible insight into a troubled, yet sharp and perceptive mind.  May make you think at least twice about autism and its impact on others as well as the recipients of this problem.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|i love to be able to listen to radio from any place in the world. i also bought it for iOS to listen on my ipad too.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|The first half of the book was really good. Looking at a concentration camp from a psychological perspective was fascinating. There were some amazing insights that apply to meaning and suffering in our own time. The second half of the book was very technical. Even with the help of Kindle's built in dictionary I had a hard time getting through it. I'm sure this is great for someone in the field, but I had difficulty paying attention during the parts that didn't have illustrations or stories.  Even so, it was well worth slogging through it.  There's good stuff in this book...even in the technical sections.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|bought it for kids bedroom as night light. works great and it has built in timer to turn off after 30 min or so. Kids enjoy getting to bed with light on and i enjoy turn off feature to save on batteries. it comes with remote control too.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Just love Maggie Smith, the furnishings in the castle and the whole wonderful cast. A real hoot!! I would recommend it to every one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved every minute of it but wish it had captions. There were many places we could not follow due to the lack of captions.
B008C2GVUG|5.0|have not seen it on BD yet, but glad I upgraded from dvd, fast and quick ship, nice packaging as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved every minute of it but wish it had captions. There were many places we could not follow due to the lack of captions.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The whole family loved it.  It was nicely done and was able to bring everything together as a great anniversary movie.
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|I instantly fell in love with this film when I saw it in the theater in 3D. I could go on and on about how good this film is, but for this review I'll just say that the 3D experience on this home version was just as magical.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|Just another stunningly great blues man. I never get tired of these great men & their incredible talent. If you love this stuff like me, try some Johnny Jenkins.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|So many great quotes and one of my favorite comedies. Can't wait for the sequel to finally get going. The DVD itself has some decent extra content too. I got this because it's not available on blu-ray yet in the states, but the visual quality is pretty good.
B002VJ0576|3.0|A very grand idea that really needed much more money & better director & better actors. But you know it was still fun to watch & if you enjoy Holmes you will enjoy this.
B00BOL3M86|3.0|Episode was great. Unfortunately the video quality was in and out. Most of the episode was at the lowest quality and froze a number of times.
0307987698|5.0|My 22 month old niece loved this one as good as the first.  Highly recommend both books for children who especially like Sesame Street characters.
B00BOL3M86|5.0|I love this show and thank Amazon for the &#34;Instant Video&#34; feature which allows me to watch this fantastic show each week... BUT what the heck happened to the writers of Episode 12 in Season 3?? It was very disappointing and did not live up to the usual great story lines that I've been accustomed to since the beginning of this series. I won't spoil the episode for those who haven't seen it yet, other than to say, &#34;Save yourself $1.89 and skip this episode because NOTHING happened in it and it only had 3 of the main characters throughout the entire episode. I went ahead and gave it 5 stars because it's a great show, normally, and I'll just chalk it up to, &#34;everybody called in sick the day they shot this incredible boring episode.&#34;
0307010856|5.0|Bought this for my 22 month old niece.  She loves books and we had a wonderful time reading this book together.
B007U8U1V8|3.0|I love Jack White, but this fell a little flat for me. I much prefer his distorted blues riffs to this, but the album isn't bad, just not what I was expecting.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Awesome show. Where have I been that I haven't seen it before now?! I can't wait to watch the other seasons.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is a book that I have enjoyed reading for sometime..if you like a good mystery this you will enjoy Sherlock. I like anything Sherlock Holmes.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Without being overly descriptive the author managed to make this world completely tangible. I didn't want the book to end.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This got me interested in the series.  A friend said it wasn't an important part of the overall story, but I enjoyed the intro.  These books are in the same genre as The Hunger Games.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very good game that is very addicting.  Great for passing the time and it takes a while to collect all of the prizes
B000M341RI|5.0|I purchased it and then was given another copy as a gift because I had mentioned  how much I love the movie.
B0011Z31V8|5.0|If you're a Prince fan, this has all the standards and then some. I was super exicted that it had Diamonds & Pearls on it. I got it for $1.99. Can't beat it!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|It's probably one of those rare times that I find more than one or two songs on the album that I actually like. This album's loaded. If you like Rock, pick this up. It's worth it's asking price.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I want to start by extending my condolences to Chris Kyle's wife and other family.  And I want to thank them for all the service Chris has done for this country.  He was truly an American hero, and will be remembered.<br /><br />Now, on to the book.  To start, for those of you looking for \\"sniper porn,\\" I don't think this book will fulfill your desires.  Chris doesn't really get into intimate details on any of his kills.  As a matter of fact, he gives more details on injuries and deaths to American soldiers, which is tough to read.  It is, however, a very informative read on what it takes to become a navy seal, and what it was like to be in the thick of the action in Iraq.  I don't think many Americans realize how tough it was for our soldiers over there, and what they sacrificed and experienced while in Iraq.  The details on difficulties Chris's family life were also eye-opening.<br /><br />As far as the general tone of the writing, I will say that I don't share Mr. Kyle's world views, and don't think I could be so black and white about seeing people as good or evil.  And being an Urbanite from a large northern city, I don't really relate to the Texas good 'ole boy persona.  Nevertheless, I think having that frame of mind probably helped him become a very accomplished soldier.  Overall, I feel like I came away with a better understanding of what it was like to fight in the Iraq war.
B00766CLPI|3.0|Found it to be a bit boring, guess not used to her singing the type of music she did on this CD
B000SW4DJO|5.0|I love the dancing and singing and all the fun you can see the characters having in the movie. it just makes the person watching it have fun and happy feelings too.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Had it downloaded to my Tivo and watched it through my TV.  What an easy way to get movies.
B002R5LKOQ|3.0|the movie was alright. I just didnt like that whole diva attitude that whitney had to act out. also the whole sister betraying sister thing. that was some pretty cold stuff.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like to play bingo,it keeps me busy and it's entertaining and you are able to play against other people.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Its a great movie for mother and daughter to watch. it shows how a mother and daughter trying to reconnect over a awful incident that the daughter had caused because she did not want to have an arranged marriage.
0143038419|5.0|I love this book and ordered extra copies so that I could share it with my friends (both men and women).
B00846F1YW|3.0|This game is okay; not as good as G5 products which I think are the best hidden objects games. The puzzles are good, not too hard but somewhat challenging.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used this keyboard for a couple years now and it's been very reliable. While it may not have very many theme options the ability to tweak small things such as long press duration, keyboard layout, and haptic feedback almost make it worthwhile. But what really sells it is the text prediction system, after using it for a month or two it became incredibly accurate. Using the keyboard now, I can text entire sentences using just the predictions.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game is like Alchemy which is a much better game in my opinion.  In both games you combine elements to create new things; elements, animals, compounds, plants, etc.  I don't care for this game's interface.  I'm not going to bad mouth the game, I just didn't like it compared to Alchemy.
030758836X|2.0|I wanted to love this book, first and foremost. I did. Sharp Objects called my name on Black Friday; as I walked by the shelves, the title drew me in and told me to stay. I rushed home with my new book and new pajamas (I'm not much of a Black Friday shopper), made a cup of coffee, and settled into my bed. I didn't leave until I shut the final page. Gillian Flynn has/had a lot of potential. I finished Sharp Objects and purchased Dark Places with my Kindle after getting a full nights sleep. Dark Places was a little rougher, unlike Sharp Objects I wasn't so enthralled that I shut off in my bed for hours on end (Sharp Objects had me transfixed because of self mutilation, as a former self mutilator, I saw myself through the main character). Dark Places was still good, phenomenal even. In my excitement I purchased Gone Girl expecting the same kind of infatuation. Not to be found. I found the wife unrealistic. The big reveal (part 2?) wasn't exactly a surprise. The husband wasn't exactly my cup of tea, either. Flynn's previous female leads were seriously messed up. Self indulgent, full of self pity, hateful even. Amy fell short compared to these wicked women. The ending felt rushed, as well. I kept expecting a big AHA moment, one that had me reading the book again, searching for the infatuation I felt in her previous novels. Not to be found. I spoke with friends who loved Gone Girl and the only thing difference was I read her books in order, friends read Gone Girl first. Even though Gone Girl wasn't the expected, I'm still anxiously awaiting her newest novel! Maybe one day I'll reread Gone Girl and fall in love with it.
B0067R0APK|5.0|The weather stays in my notifications so all I have to do is click on it and I've got all the information I need for the day.  I have several locations which I can switch to right on the opening screen.  It gives you details about the weather which include humidity, visibility, UV Index, Sunrise, Sunset, and a wind compass with speed and gusts.  You can touch an icon to get several days' weather, a map, weather clips, and more. I think it's a great app, well worth 99 cents.  :-)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is more fun than the original Angry Birds, but probably because I am also a Star Wars fan.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|We have seen him in concert, and he gives his all to the audience.  More contemporary songs that he does add interest to the mix.<br />I like his voice, and can listen to him over and over.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great characters and story.  Hard to put down so make sure you have plenty of time to read this one!
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Having survived your enlistment.  You are chosen to lead a colony on a new world.  The whole thing is a s set-up from a corrupt organization that is quite prepared to sacrifice you and 2500 others.  Sort of like a wagon train sent off to Oregon in the 1840's.  You're abandoned by your government amongst hostile indians (aliens), but nobody knows where you are.  No television, no radio, not  a single luxury.  You manage to survive and the government that sent you there wants you wiped out so they can declare war on the indians (aliens).  A great science fiction story.  I think I would have enjoyed this story as a teen.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Love all of Colleen Hoover's books.  Hopeless is my favorite but Slammed is a close second.  Especially liked the Avett Brothers lyrics as intros for the chapters.  Some of the poetry is quote-worthy too.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|So how would you like to start all over again when you're seventy five but aged only twenty?  What a great fantasy.  The only problem is you're very unlikely to survive your ten year enlistment.  And this is working for a corrupt organization.  The hero gets very lucky (sometimes experience helps). Oh if only we could all start over knowing what we know now.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I love this game! 100 levels of match 3 fun. 3 fun modes will keep you entertained. Get to playing!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This si a wonderful DVD collection of the 2004 concert in Australia.  All the songs you know and love are performed.  Really enjoyable DVD that that makes a good addition to your collection, which you will watch over and over..
B005URRCUY|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this album and the seller! It is excellent from start to finish! Its definitely an album that you can listen to over and over again.
1939416019|5.0|Good book in the fantasy series which ends with a cliff hanger. Nice read Cant stop reading until the end of the book. Will be similar to Christhopher Paolni's Eragon series books.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This really rounds up all the details of how food works with our digestive system and its effect on our health. I am more conscious of what I eat without eliminating any foods.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Characters are rich and the plot is not typical - twists/turns, which kept me addicted to the next episode! Keep these shows coming!
B001B6NAGS|5.0|I really wanted to see this movie after family members were raving about it.  Netflix on-line streaming didn't have it (and i'm very unhappy with their streaming videos) so I checked Amazon and there it was.  The movie was great and I had zero issues with downloading it or watching it.  Recommend Amazon Instant Video highly.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a pretty good story line.  The style third has kept  my interest going.  This is the third book in the series.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like it and the kids love to play it all the time. great for keeping the lil guys occupied
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Loved everything about this set - Great audio and video transfers and excellent bonus material. The packaging is also appropriately classy and doesn't take up much shelf space, which is a plus for me.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Wonderful book about the human condition. Life, death, strategy, manipulation, lies, truth, childhood, challenge, limits, potential.  Heart wrenching at times, it speaks to the soul.
B002BWP49C|2.0|This is probably the worst of the 4 movies so far, but you have no choice, you have to watch it to get to #5
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It's unique because it lets you combine different relaxing sounds and there are so many to choose from. I love the timer feature-l used it to go to sleep last night.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|My wife is a weather nut. We have a Davis weather station, and various rain gauges in the front yard. The TV is likely to be on the Weather Channel, and she always tunes in the local news just for the weather segment. She has Intellicast Radar & Accuweather on the PC, and WeatherUnderground on her phone. I swear she bought the van simply because it had a thermometer built into the display! (I should point out that she is retired and has absolutely no where to go, but that doesn't stop her from worrying about the weather outside.)<br /><br />I got this app for our Kindle Fire. She loves it. It is packed with tons of information. The display is very nice and interactive. She has been using it for a couple weeks and is still discovering features.

B008JGSM6G|3.0|Was fun at first but then I got bored of it. Even the difficult levels didn't hold my attention. Ended up deleting it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a classic game. The screen are good, and the puzzles challenging. We like it and play it all the time. Recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Just like what you would find in arcades. Got it for my son just as a new game for him but he lost interest in about 5 minutes.
1609611543|5.0|Satisfied with the purchase and the anticipated results that were desired from the reviews of other users of this product.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|First off I didnt buy the movie I just rented it.  Got to say my expectations were low but i was pleasantly surprised,  pretty good movie
0525953728|4.0|Satisfied with the purchase and the anticipated results that were desired from the reviews of other users of this product.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it my kids really enjoy taking care of the horses ans so do I. They didn't know how much it took to take care of them. They want the unicorns so bad. So that is the goal. I would tell any one who loves horses to try this app out.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is one of those books that had so much meat!  Pearls of wisdom...especially when you are in the midst of suffering of any kind.  It will ring true to you if you have ever suffered (which we all do) for anything.
B000TCEU4Q|4.0|This is an excellent product for training cessna also you can confing for plaing an Airbus 320  and Boeing 737
0061537969|5.0|This book will surprise you!  I read it because our book club was reading it.... I thought it sounded ridiculous that it was being told from a dog's perspective, but I read it anyway.  I found myself underlining and taking notes on the pearls of wisdom that are in it.  I have recommended it to several people and bought it for a few.
B004G600A4|4.0|I would have given this item the last star, but this used item &#34;broke up&#34; in 2 places.  It was particularly annoying since the last few minutes of the film had no sound.  I shall try cleaning it.  It was described on-line as excellent; so I had that expectation.<br /><br />The movie itself is fine for any little or big girl.  Even small boys may enjoy the action of  the men.  Very colorful.
B006HUEVCU|5.0|This is an excellent story that grabs your attention on the first few pages.  You can plan on staying up very late at night to finish this book!  The main character is a billionaire that has ex-wives that he has paid off to get rid of them.  The grandchildren was given millions as they became of age.  How fast can you spend that much money?  Stay tuned to find the answer!  There are some twists and turns that makes this an unforgettable book.  One of the best surprises is that a lawyer that has been on the path to self-destruction accepts his Salvation. You have to read this book to get the rest of the answers.  Wow! Love this story!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was well done and the story was amazing. Not usually my sort of movie but I ended up really liking it.
B0043D2FB2|4.0|This particular collection of selections from the Pali Canon is one of the more accessible I've found. Clearly written, well footnoted, with insightful interpretations, it is a great reference on the fundamentals of the Buddha's teachings.
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|At first I was confused and didn't know what was going on. I stuck with it and was so glad I did. It's beautifully done and very well acted and I ended up loving it.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was an eye-opener for me, having never heard about cell research except a few snippets on the news.  I barely got through high school biology, so I had no idea what was going on in the world of research, much less how people like Ms. Lacks were exploited and lied to about tissue samples from their own bodies!  Rebecca Skloot ought to get the Nobel Peace Prize for her passion and determination to tell this story--and tell it she did, so well, I would rate this book a 10 out of 10.  I even discussed the book with my dermatologist, who is also a dermapathologist.  He had not heard about the Lacks case, but said he planned to get the book and he and his wife will both read it.  I read this book for our book club, and I am glad I did. Kudos to Skloot for a fascinating read born of a ton of research!  And may Henrietta rest in peace now that her story has been told!
B008MEM24S|1.0|Pay .99 for this to spend 1.99 for the rest if the levels? You can keep it.  Kind of sad really.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|r<br />this game is soooooo fun. there is no bad things. since this game is 3d you'd think it would be gltchy but its not. buy it!!!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Brilliant musician and poet wrapped up in a humble, intelligent man. This documentary captures all of Rodriguez in a thoughtful and exciting manner without being syrupy about it. The black and white visual imagery of Detroit in the winter contrasted with Capetown SA were gorgeous. I loved the idea that these men started what they thought was a small project to find out about a lost icon and discovered a real, living person.<br /><br />I will purchase his two albums and enjoy them for the rest of my life. What a 50 year loss for all of us who didn't know him when we were young.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I did not want it to end!<br />loved this game. just the right mix of puzzel and hidden objects.  not too hard. just right. great graphics and fun story line!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I like the color codes and ease of erasing of wrong answers.  All in all a great game with many levels.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|One of the best shows on television. The acting is absolutely superb. HBO has done a great job with this mini series and I simply can't wait for Season 3 to begin.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Had heard a few things about firefly. Then saw Nathan Fillion getting mobbed at comic con so I gave it a try. Watched the whole season and wished there was more. Looking forward to the movie.
B0061QD88S|5.0|I love this movie, it takes me back! Haha Glad I got it before it went back into the Disney vault. It even came a day before expected. Awesome.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I got this to entertain my three-year-old, who loves My Little Pony.  This game is way beyond her abilities and understanding.  My fault for not looking into it before I bought it.  It would be nice if the creators of the game would create a preschooler version.  They have a lot of younger fans who'd love that.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|great songs, great music, great vocals! if you love hendrix like me youll love this album! i cant think of a reason to pass this buy!
B0045HCJSK|5.0|It's John Wayne with many other older actors that I enjoyed after seeing where it was made at Old Tucson Movie set
B00B5HQL50|5.0|NICE ADDITION TO THE BOND MOVIES I HAVE...I HAVE OF DANIEL CRAIG'S BOND MOVIES. I AM MISSING JUST TOMMOROW NEVERS DIES WITH PIERCE BROSNON.....LOVE THE NEW MOVIE...FAST AND FURIOUS...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is completly catching!!! get ready to adore the horses in your stable and purchase all the variety of tack. Simply follow the task the stable boy gives or order gems and cash with your credit card. I am playing on my kindle and just now on level 11 having glitches due to advertisements.  Really fun check it out
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very easy first levels but, they do get more difficult as you progress.  It is a very addicting game.  Would recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for wasting time.it is also a good way to keep yourself entertained. I regimens this for someone who mists wants a simple game.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I am a huge Ken Follet fan but am having trouble remembering all the characters (too many). Im only in the begining of the book but will stick it out because he never dissapoints me.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I got these for my Hubby for our Anniversary. And all we did was laugh all evening.. Just plain good humor..
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Great movie will be purchasing it grandchildren. Animation was so life like.. my little one especially the boys will love this movie
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love this show<br />Funnier each time we see it<br />Got 1-4 and this completed it so far..<br />Goooooood Clean humor.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Wonderful characters, great pace and a damn funny read make this one of the best books I have read in a long, long time.<br /><br />I laughed so hard in places I almost cried, but all along this is a beautiful story about beautiful people who see the worlds little differently...<br /><br />Thank you Graeme for a terrific escape :)
B006YXTRHY|5.0|They really nailed the key parts of the book in this movie!!!  If you love the book, you will love this movie...
B002L3ARRU|5.0|We totalloy enjoyed the non sto humor.. where no one really cursed,  no one really got hurt,<br />and we thought  back about our times in high school.  A movie for those 10 to 90.<br /><br />and the young Charlie Sheen is a bit part..was this his first movie ?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you want to follow Spanish news, this is the app. Very convenient. And covers more newspapers than you will ever need.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is one of those psychological thrillers that sticks with you long after you finish reading!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I found this book helpful in dealing with relationships. I've used the information on my teenage daughter and it really is effective.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks & Safe Haven was awesome! A real page turner & tough to put down!!! If you saw the movie ... you will Love the book!!!!!
B000W4RFHK|4.0|Good writing.  Poetic prose. Less frenetic by far than On the Road.  I give up on the 8 more words for this review.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|Great acting and storyline.  I never would have known the story behind the conspiracy to kill President Lincoln and the effect it had on one family.
B006WPWH4E|5.0|I have always love to play this game. Grew up playing this with cards. It is so much<br />easier on my TAB! Hours go by faster when waiting is involved where ever I have<br />to be or just sitting at home watching TV.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This was my favorite book when I was in high school. I loved english class, and I loved reading just about everything. But this book meant more to me than any of the other ones. I'm sure part of it was Bronte's engaging writing style, and the other part was just the story itself. To me this is a top rung classic novel, which makes me wonder why it only has 4 stars. I'm curious why the rating is low. When it first came out it was criticized for being too course and vulgar. When I was in high school it seemed to be highly respected. Is that society has gone so far that it seems tame now? Is that why people don't seem to like it as much as they used to? I don't know. I'm just curious, and it's still one of my alltime favorite novels.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game! Fun for the whole family! I love sliding the little pudding blobs all over the table. Children will enjoy it too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent show and very dedicating once you watch a few episodes! The quality was excellent and it filled the entire big screen!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Graphics are really good, story is entertaining, overall this game was awesome loved it. Try the hardest setting in the game it will keep you entertained fir hours.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|Follet keeps writing the same book in different historical contexts.  I loved Pillars of the Earth because it was the first one of these I read and I admired how Follet introduced a real historical context into the novel.  But thius gets tired on the third read.  I could not even finish this book, nor do I have the appetite to begain the next.  There is only som many times you can read about the poor family with the beautiful daughted and the idot sn getting abused by the wealthy.  Reading ONE of thes s great.  But reading four or five is pure torture.
B005FITIGO|5.0|There are no murders or guns or explosions in this movie. Nevertheless, it is a highly suspenseful movie. In a nutshell, one of the financial analysts in a huge corporation is on the trail of a problem when he is let go. His protege, a mathematical whiz, takes it up the very same day and analyzes the algorithm being used and discovers that the company's holdings on mortgage bundles is about to go into freefall, which means the utter disintegration of the company. An all night conference brainstorms for a way out, with ethical dilemmas coming to the forefront.<br /><br />Superb performances by all.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|Follet keeps writing the same story and pawning it off in new books.  I have not read this one yet (I simply cannot keep reading the same story) so my review may be incorrect.  get ONE of these, read and enjoy.  But do not waste money on the others, which are merely a rehash of the same tired story line.
B003PN52CA|5.0|I've been iut of the loop with this group for a couple of years, but I'm glad I got this one. A lot of really lively, upbeat music that just feels good to listen to.<br />Bonus material, 2 music videos, and the making of 1<br />These are cool too
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty nice game. It's the first time I have ever &quot;rode&quot; a horse. I want a real horse some day and though this is definitely not how it goes with real horses, it's fun to pretend.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I enjoyed more the stories of the writer rather than the story itself.<br />I found Serena to plain (maybe the character was intended that way), but I enjoyed more Tom's shorts stories and the way the character presented itself.<br />The last novel I read from Mcewan was &#34;On Chesil Beach&#34; and I liked far more than this one.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Have not had any issues with the product and definately charges the iphone fast.  I do like the fact that the product is easy to install into the car, the cord is sturdy and locks into the phone tightly.<br /><br />Would recommend this to anyone with a iphone 5.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|i haven't had a chance to read a yet but heard its a great book so when i have a chance i will get to it
B005LAII94|5.0|My favorite part in this movie is when Lado visits one of his drug cohort's home and shoots him in the leg and as he is leaving, he says &#34; You Have A Nice Day&#34; in very light spoken calm voice.  Gotta Love Lado's character in this movie !
B006C1DH92|5.0|I downloaded this app when it was an Amazon free app of the day for my son.  There aren't many apps that he plays over and over but this one he does.  He loves it.
B000IZ9UEY|5.0|If you looking for an action movie, this is it .  Benicio actually injured his arm during the filming and he now only has 93 % usage on his arm.
B000056HE9|5.0|Are you kidding?  Cary Grant and Christmas movie????  It doesn't get much better than that.  This is a very good movie-much better than the remade modern version
B00009ZYBY|5.0|not a type of movie i usually watch but it was an outstanding job by Russell Crowe.  I would recommend this.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Excellent series. The streaming on Amazon prime had a few ups and downs, but otherwise it's great. I'm on to season 4.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|I LOVE THE MUSIC. THE FOO FIGHTERS SOUND IS GREAT. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS C.D. TO ANY ALTERNATIVE MUSIC LOVER.
B0007939NO|5.0|Loved everything about this experience
1439190275|3.0|IT'S OKAY. MAYBE BETTER SUITABLE FOR SOMEONE ELSE BESIDES MYSELF. DOES NOT DO MUCH FOR ONE'S SELF BUT DOES HAVE SOME GOOD POINTER'S IN IT.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|A legend that still shines. We need artists like him to not let the music die. He can sing whatever style of music he wants. A blues man, a soul man, a jazz man, rock man. Whatever he sings is a pleasure to listen. 5 STARS for this album.
B000089RVX|5.0|A+++ MUSIC. EVANESCENCE MUSIC IS SOOTHING TO THE EARS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS C.D. TO ALL OF YOU OUT THERE.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Self Righteous, so annoying. The end spoiled it for me. It was a 5 till the end. Men that is why women leave you, stupid decisions. Follow a woman's instinct when it comes to children.
0817439390|5.0|This book is amazing. Makes everything clear about photography and how using the manual program. Can't wait to read the other author's book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed the game and it was for sure worth the time to play. Great graphics and fun story line. Only down side would be it ended too soon and was fairly easy even on advanced mode
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Don't usually like &#34;live performance&#34; albums but I am enjoying this one!!  Somehow Sinatra's casual, easy going style come through on this collection!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Mike does a great job of laying out a fitness plan that makes sense. His writing is clear, succinct, and endearingly irreverent.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is an engaging game for a free one. The paid version is a bit more complex, but this one is a great version to learn how to play Majong.  For those who don't know how to play, its basically the same as solitaire.  You look for matching pairs and try to clear the board.  When no more matches are available, it will reshuffle the remaining tiles, and you work the matches until the board clears.  Then a more difficult puzzle is loaded and you do it again.  Simple enough to teach middle aged children, yet complex enough to keep adults engaged for at least a few weeks.  I spent the extra buck or two and got the upgraded version and am very pleased with that.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Recovery of the original film in a complete copy of considerably higher category.<br />I recommend to all who have seen and not seen.<br />Sincerely Ulysses
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo is a really well made and elegantly acted movie. My only critique would be that I wish it more closely matched the historical facts.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|love it ........watched with the family.......recommend to all families.make sure to have it playing on surround youll definately feel the effects.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|GOOD FACE BOOK APP IT WORKS FINE EASY TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL NO ISSUES. . . . . . .

B0066WJLU6|5.0|VERY NICE APP FOR USING THE LIGHT ON YOUR PHONE TO SEE TO DO THINGS IN THE DARK IF THERE IS NO FLASHLIGHT RIGHT THERE
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|But it has weird loading issues.  Tasks are easy enough to complete. And I haven't been hounded to spend real money yet so, that's good too. :)
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I really have nothing against this app. It was free and I thought I would try it out. There's no errors on kindle fire that I noticed. But I just couldn't seem to get past taking pictures of the horse. I haven't touched the app since the first time I've played it.<br /><br />I think I would recommend this to only those who really love playing horse games.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I re-viewed season 1 and 2 and they still held my attention until the last 2 chapters.  Maybe it should have ended at season 2.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I do like this game, but after the first day of being overly psyched by its game play, I quickly grew tired of it. I still play it, but only every once in a while, when I don't feel like reading.<br /><br />There isn't any issue with this app on my kindle fire. Although this isn't something I would openly recommend to someone, it's also not something I have anything bad to say about it. Fun, but not consecutively.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I checked out a bunch of note apps, none of them had hand writing. This one has hand writing out of the box. Very easy to use.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Denzel Washington is a wonderful actor, saddled with a script that goes from an intriguing initial setup to an AA screed.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Just got the app, so far so good. Like the graphics and the story line seams to be good. Hidden object game with good mini puzzles
B007J4T2G8|5.0|it is actually a powerful love story! couldn't put it down and read all three books within a couple of days
B00005JM02|5.0|I wanted to expand our DVD collection for my children (ages 3 1/2 and 2) and I knew that Nemo would be a good choice.  This DVD arrived and the case looks brand new.  The DVD itself plays perfectly, no issues at all.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
1400067820|4.0|I like the book but I would not qualify it as an easy read.  I would recommend it to friends who have some level of dedication to this way of thinking.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I really love period pieces, and this surprisingly has gone towards one of my top favorites with Sense & Sensibility and Price & Prejudice.  I have really come to love Emily Blunt and her acting and Rupert Grint is so amazingly good looking.  This was a true love story that made my heart melt :-).
B00081U7HC|5.0|Julia and Richard make a great couple.  Very funny and storybook like.  I would recommend to anyone wanting a good storyline.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|This isn't a typical movie that I would enjoy or even try to watch but Rob sold me on it.  And he MADE this movie!
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Loveeeee Dean & Sam.I miss Bobby & Cass wish they can bring them back.I do not miss an episode.love it
B001P5M7QE|5.0|If you can watch this movie without laughing or quoting it the entire time, your funny bone should be checked.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I bought this for my daughter and she is 12 she listens to it all the time and truly enjoys it.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|This is by far the best MJ concert to date! I love how it is all about him and not so much of the crowd. I have live at Bucharest, but it was too much audience being shown and not enough of the artist you want to see. Love the BAD concert much more.
B008KEQMDC|1.0|The movie wouldn't even play all the way through... Not please with my product would like to return it for a copy of the video that I can actually watch the whole thing.
B005OIAKB2|5.0|Although it was a step away from their usual content, I'm glad this great band is still producing music, there is still hope, I can't wait for violence to hit the shelves, till then &#34;Forget everything just for tonight We'll sing like everyone when they're alone...&#34;
B005LAIHVI|4.0|Perhaps the best way to summarize the feeling you'll receive from Jack the Giant Slayer is this: Welcome back, Bryan Singer; You are indeed forgiven for Superman Returns, sir.<br /><br />No, really, it is THAT good.<br /><br />It is good enough to make you forget that horrid moment when Superman was getting dragged hair- and face-first by some nameless goons (oh and Kumar), and he managed to let out a desperate, horrifically out-of-character scream of, “I'm still Superman!”<br /><br />For those of you who know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who are going to zip on over to YouTube or dig through your guilty pleasure collection and fast-forward that fumbled rehash of the Richard Donner and Christopher Reeves era with the subtitles on: You.<br /><br />Were.<br /><br />WARNED …<br /><br />…<br /><br /> … Did you see it?<br /><br />Awful, right? And now you can't UN-see it. You're welcome.<br /><br />BUT! Even though you can't erase the memory I've just Incepted you with, you can certainly run down to your local theater now and use the epically fun Jack the Giant Slayer to cleanse your mental palette.<br /><br />Now, I'm not sure how many people have been following the development of this film. After all, Singer certainly didn't exactly help his Hollywood credibility following up Superman Returns by throwing a Nazi uniform on Tom Cruise (though, for the record, Valkyrie was good!). Perhaps the uh Stanley Tucci fans? Ewan McGregor fans? Did they forget the Jedi-mullet?  In any case, based on the weekend receipts and projections, it's not going to be pretty, and the studio did jack squat (see what I did there) to help this picture by showcasing the films worst instances of CGI in the trailers and utilizing that beat-to-death marketing campaign of flooding a trailer with utterances of the titular character's name (looking at YOU, Parker!).<br /><br />The poor box office is simply a travesty. Let's not forget Singer gave us one of the greatest superhero movies of all time in X-Men 2 AND he wrote the story for the much-beloved X-Men: First Class (which people seem to forget when they claim every X-film before First Class was trash, but I digress). Not to mention the powerful Apt Pupil and everyone's favorite pimpin' limpin' villain in The Usual Suspect's Keyser Soze.<br /><br />After that, we OWE it to Singer, dammit, because this film is so good. And you know what MAKES this movie so good? Singer had the balls to break the conventions we would've pointed to to justify the feeble box office, and both the storytelling and action were so tight that you can almost picture Singer going, “Yeah, remember me? Remember what I can do?” Well, I pictured it, and I certainly was forced to remember what he's capable of.<br /><br />The film, like any other, has flaws, ranging from the miscasting of King Brahmwell (Ian McShane (should have been Bernard Hill)), a Padme-and-Anakin-esque conversation between Jack (Nicholas Hoult) and Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) early on, and distracting aesthetics like Jack's hoodie and Elmont (McGregor)'s Team Edward haircut. Not to mention some video-game-level CGI that goes into the giants, which we all should've been aware of going into the theater.<br /><br />However, the key to any good story is not to be free of flaws but to be alive and organic enough to essentially force the audience to get over them because the ride is just that gripping. Such was the case with Jack the Giant Slayer. It would have been so easy for Singer to regurgitate all the trappings of fantasy and adventure storytelling into a quick cash-machine without putting any thought and energy into the subtle complexities (looking at YOU this time, Wreck-It-Ralph). Instead, there is care put into virtually every aspect of this film. Upon every instance of you as the audience starting to believe you've got a bead on what's going to happen next, this movie utterly smashes your expectations and puts together something even better.<br /><br />You want specifics, you say? Well, first of all, this movie is full of characters who actually THINK. It's a sad state of our modern movie-going experience when we can watch a movie free of characters who are stupid because the plot demands they should be stupid. Sure, Jack must make that initial exchange for the Magic Beans as the classic fairytale dictates, but his curiosity was piqued early on by his father telling him stories of an ancient war with a race of giants that reside in a cloud kingdom, and Jack wasn't the only one. Isabelle receives a joint bedtime story exposition sequence and acquires a taste for adventure from her royal mother (which is perhaps all-too-familiar for the five of us who saw Hellboy II: The Golden Army). Following the death of both of these orating parents (which should've been given a scene), Jack is left in the hands of a cruel uncle and Isabelle her protective father.<br /><br />A chance encounter with Isabelle in town plants the seeds of romance for these two, and Jack gets a taste of her world, which entails constant supervision by the elite King's Guardians, headed by McGregor's Elmont and his trusty second-in-command Crawe (Eddie Marsan), who also required an additional scene to round them out. After Jack and Isabelle inevitably receive their scoldings from their guardians for being too naive, the former is left steaming and in possession of the beans, while the latter flees from both the castle and her arranged marriage to the boundlessly ambitious and ruthless Roderick (Stanley Tucci). Isabelle happens upon Jack's cottage while his uncle is out attempting to rectify Jack's misguided transaction, and following that at-times painful exchange I mentioned before, one of the beans gets wet, sprouts, and we're off to the races!<br /><br />What follows is wonderful example of what can get done in fantasy/action-adventure films when the writer and director have zero tolerance for a stale and meandering plot. Once Jack is discovered at the bottom of the beanstalk, absent princess-in-distress, a rescue party is dispatched, and both Jack and Roderick inevitably join up in the race to retrieve Isabelle before the giants realize they've got a route to wage war on humanity once again. At this point you may start to mentally prepare yourself for yet another drawn-out journey where the company is able to rescue Isabelle and in the process exhibit all that is right with Jack and all that is wrong with Roderick; add a dash of blatant set-piece action, a sniveling coward character for comic relief, and a moment when the leading woman takes her place amongst the boys by being the one to stop the war and save everyone's collective ass, and we're set, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />Not only does this story have brains, it has guts.<br /><br />Secondary characters are forced to don red shirts and walk the tight-rope.<br /><br />Roderick's personal goon (Ewen Bremner) is much scarier than he has any right to be.<br /><br />Isabelle sees Jack for who he is on his own merits and not in stark contrast to Roderick, whose motives aren't allowed to simmer for 90 minutes before a grand betrayal.<br /><br />And the giants do make it down to the ground to go Gojira on our structures and devour humans in brutal (albeit in blood- and gore-free) fashion.<br /><br />The heroes are roughly thrust into an impossible situation and forced to handle it, and it feels so good to find a storyteller who does not fall so in love with his own creations that they are unwilling to take this sink-or-swim approach. To those of you who cringed at the CGI displayed in the trailers, allow me to assuage your apprehensions by saying Singer smartly films in a manner to keep the giants and humans separate for the majority of the movie, and everything that should have been a physical prop, WAS a physical prop. There's even a scene where one of hour heroes is about to be turned into a pastry and you can watch the giant crepe bread they've been wrapped in BAKE. And the scale and pace of the action was just unapologetically both brutal and fun. The King gets hands-on and makes sacrifices to drive home the severity of the threat. Furthermore, the tactics and innovations in the climactic battle make it clear that the giants and humans have been preparing for the possibility of another war for a very long time, and the battle is sprinkled with glorious tide-swinging moments up until the final charge.<br /><br />AND, when the short-lived World War Giant II is over, we're given the cherry on top in the form of a foreboding wink that Singer has perfected.<br /><br />I freely admit that perhaps the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much was because I let it catch me off-guard. I went in with tempered expectations. And no doubt some of you will now watch the film after I've hyped it up and be disappointed. But don't come back and say it sucked. And don't even say that the film's quality exists in a vacuum unsullied by the audience's interpretation. Instead, simply join me in saying: Welcome back, Bryan Singer; You are indeed forgiven for Superman Returns, sir.a stale and meandering plot.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|I started watching this program from season 5, so was totally thrilled to see Prime offer it from the beginning. It's interesting to see all the twists and turns the characters have gone through. thank you Prime for offering it!
0071636080|5.0|This is must reading for anyone delivering presentations with any frequency. Jobs was a master for sure, but not necessarily naturally. Work, purpose, practice, diligence all play a key role. Regardless of whether you're presenting products or services, you will learn from this very readable book and your presentations will get drastically better!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a good love story. It was predictable though. Same old thing, fight for love, lose it ,end up together. I recommend this book to all those who drink to much at the bar and not having control over what happens!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|&#34;Couldn't put it down&#34; really does apply to this story. Right from the beginning the reader knows it is fantasy but one gets hooked within the first pages. Is the tiger real? Will he eat Pi as the food runs out? Will they become fast friends. The many subplots grab the reader as life on the raft move towards. . . . what? we don't know. I love the boy Pi, I feel a kinship with the tiger. I love the book. I wanted to run out and grab a kid so I could read it to him/her.<br /><br />Now, onto se the movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Am having lots of fun playing &#34;Rio&#34;.<br /> It is very colorful and I love the sounds.<br />It is just plain fun!
0425252868|5.0|This book is not your avarage WWll story. These men in the book are the men who the book is all about and who actually wrote the book in their words and who lived all the action you will read about. I'm have a large collection of WWll information and books and actual items from the war. I also study history and in those respects this book is a perfect read. If WWll is your interest don't miss this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|For sure!  I finished reDing this the day before hitting the movie theater.  Felt the book was WAY BETTER than yhe movie because it filled in allllll the pieces not in the video.  Fabulous writing, Mr. Sparks!!!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Ms. Flynn chose a terribly unsatisfying ending.  If the &#34;bad guy&#34; gets to win, at least (in realistic fiction) make it believable.  It's as if even the author got tired of the unbelievable &#34;coexistence&#34; between Nick and Amy after her return.  It sure seemed like they got tired of it.  I thought the author wrote a great mystery, for the first half of the book, and the twist she created was awesome.  But having Amy always win, no matter what awful things she did, got very tiresome.  And I'm not sure who Ms. Flynn hangs out with, but I don't believe every character (and on nearly every page) would really use the f-word that much.  That detracted immensely from her writing and her story.
1476712042|5.0|So I went and bought this book yesterday and started to read it last night and I am finished 24 hours later.  I really liked it I loved Abby (aka, pidge), Travis and his dad and brothers, he best friend America bf and Travis's roomy Shepley.  Well I loved the whole I am trying to be a good girl bit yet she find Travis and she faces the truth and learn to except it.  Once the back and forth is over (which made a fun read such as the frat parties) I love that these two have together.  I do however wish I knew how Travis's dad and brothers reacted to what happens at the end of the book I am glad America and Shep knew.  Lot's of fun to read can't wait for the second book!
B005XDHNF4|3.0|Not at all what I expected. Ver disappointed. It's just very very small. . I should have read the ad better
B003ZDNWOA|5.0|This is a great book. In fact, I've bought it twice - once in hardback and once for the Kindle (because the hardback is heavy and I wanted to be able to search the text). An invaluable read for the perfume enthusiast or collector, and beautifully written, but also surprisingly funny.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Why didn't this movie win best picture at the Oscars?  Amazing film!  Great acting all around. Wish I could give it 7 stars.
158270208X|5.0|This is just what I need with me. This is an excelent journal, It helps me to be a better and wonderful person every day, and enjoy all the beautiful things around me. Thanks Rhonda.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|It has taken a while to narrow in what i thought was the problem with Part II of Deathly Hallows. It is that Wizards with wands would never wrestle. The author knew this, and the director, who said Deathly Hallows would follow the book, did not understand that the books ending was the only way to do it, that end makes all 8 books make sense, \\"the reason Harry Potter survived\\"
B00632HWOG|5.0|i like it alot it helps keep me orginized and it is reall easy to use and easy to find all ur msg
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I just bought this cause I like Brian Sanderson but this book exceeded my expectations. It was very good, the characters interesting and insightful. I really enjoyed it

B0083P1QUM|5.0|Been reading Patricia Cornwell's work for twenty years and still look forward to her next book!  Love the love story between Kay and Wesley.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I bought 300 gems and I got nothing this was not the first time it happened to me also my data just disappeared
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A very good book. It's hard to put down. I will definitely read the rest of the Jack Reacher series.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Capturing Read! I had to know what was going to happen. All in all, super duper good book with a great author.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Great reading....Connolly spins three really good stories that confirm once again why he is the best writer in his genre. Tight story line, believable characters and fast-paced action make for good end-of-day reading. Keeping up with Bosch as he works the case is pure entertainment.<br />I admit to being a big Connolly fan so there is some bias here. I also like short stories so this book was made for me. You can put a short story down whenever you want and pick it up whenever it is convenient without losing the storyline.<br />Bedtime mystery readers - this is a must!
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game play is fairly easy while the levels still provide a challenge.  I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys hidden object games.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|De Mille is noted for being wordy, but in this story getting to the meat takes too many boring pages.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this alarm daily with no problems. very customizable. you can set how long you want your snooze to be, which is my favorite part.
B0086700CM|1.0|being an octogenarian, I found the game difficult to navigate.Maybe my hand eye coordination isnt what it used to be
B009UX2YAC|5.0|everyone knows about it and that's good because my friends let me use their stuff to play it I beg them to
B00AREIAI8|5.0|lots of fun it is the next best thing to having her own horse she plays it all the time
0060090383|5.0|I bought this book ages ago but I'm only doing a review now.  It's a good thing it's a Marian Keyes book though because I'm a huge fan!  I would highly recommend any of her books as un-put-downable!  I'm sure I laughed and cried!  Do yourself a favour and read this book!
B00A7CI82I|5.0|The Bourne Legacy is a well played extention to the Jason Bourne francise. The character is well thought out and played with finess by Jeremy Renner, Renner's character in my opinion gives Mr. Bond a run for his money.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|Really enjoyed getting caught up with the show and able to step to each new episode but  following on my cable since its 2$ an episode now,
B000JJRIP2|5.0|very good, quality service, long life rock and roll.  a a a a a a a a a a a .
B003L77G6K|5.0|great show. good season. came as described worked fine. no problems I definitely recommend this project. l l l l l
B001UTW7QU|5.0|extraordinary!ow full of twists and turns and drama, intriguing characters and extreme science... The opening season is fantastic and is definitely worth investigating!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|My girlfriend convinced me to \\"give it a try\\". The characters are complex and interesting, the plot always twisting, and the social issues facinating!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was inspired to read the &#34;Reacher&#34; series after seeing the movie with Tom Cruise.  I was not disappointed by this first book in the series.  It was an engrossing read with nice twists and turns, only slightly predictable in the &#34;love story&#34; aspect but overall a very engaging intelligent read.  Highly recommend!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I really liked the movie the acting put you in the place they were experiencing.  Amazon instant video sucks. It freezes and hangs up.  It's not on my end I can stream Netflix immediately after Amazon freeze up.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Enjoyable romantic read.  Nice character development and rather engrossing story line with an unexpected twist at the end.  Suitable for young teenagers and adults of all ages.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I have played alot of hidden object games. I had a rather low expectation that this one was any different than the other short ones I've downloaded. But I quickly found this one refreshingly different. The hint button refilled fast enough that you didn't lose interest. Plus you can play it again on expert mode, just to challenge yourself. I was thrilled with the good graphics and the various different hidden objects as well. Definitely worth the money!
B003UBTX7C|2.0|Baldacci seems to have run out of good Ideas for the Camel Club.  The members are barely used here and their strengths are sorely underused.  Alsothe story line wasway too complicated and convoluted.  It was almost like he would start a plot line and then not find a way out so he segued to another plot in a clumsy fashion.  The poorest of all the Baldacci books I have read.
0307165485|5.0|I love this book!  All of Richard Scarry's talents are shown in this book.  It not only has his typical labeled pictures but also beautifully illustrated stories for little ones.  For slightly older kids, there are fun stories like &#34;Couscous the Algerian Detective.&#34;  I had this book as a child, my kids have this book, and I have bought it for numerous babies.  It is timeless!
0143038583|5.0|He drove a tractor through a sea of rolling dark chocolate. He became a temporary vegetarian. He bought a cow. He slit the carotid artery of a few upside down chickens in a glass slaughterhouse. Over the course of several years, Michael Pollan documented his experiences, research, and opinions, addressing The Omnivore’s Dilemma, in three sections: corn, grass, and the forest.<br />  Flip to any page, and all you see are biology terms and SAT vocabulary words, separated by ‘for’s, ‘and’s, and ‘the’s. Pollan’s sophisticated language, though proves to be enhancing, requires some knowledge beyond everyday-street-talk lingo… or a dictionary. Sometimes Pollan gets a bit too wordy and, well… the pages are thin. Readers may find their eyes glazing over, but Pollan knows to create special anecdotes at the start of every section to keep readers interested.<br />  Upon first glance, all I saw was four hundred and fifty 0.003 inch-thick pages of size 10 font.  But the first twenty-one words, “Air-conditioned, odorless, illuminated by buzzing fluorescent tubes, the American supermarket doesn’t present itself as having very much to do with Nature,” formed the foremost of many sentences to make me raise my eyebrows.<br />  Pollan begins each chapter and subchapter with a particularly invoking sentences and titles/headings, and forces you to keep reading. If that doesn’t work, he’s already got another hook on you from the last sentence of the previous paragraph. And he doesn’t disappoint.<br />  Pollan starts off with a scene at the supermarket, using colorful imagery and metaphors to describe the produce, meanwhile commenting on where it has come from, where it is going – things people normally wouldn’t consider when shopping.  “We look like corn chips on legs,” he says, but “without humans to plant it every spring, corn would have risked extinction.” At this point, he has persuaded the readers that corn is, indeed, the most crucial element to the food industry.<br />  With the new appreciation for corn planted inside the reader’s mind (“married,” we are), Pollan dives straight into the cold and hard truth of agriculture.  Squeezed from the earth at an enormous rate using chemicals and unsustainable amounts of petroleum, corn is tossed around skillfully in the words of Pollan, and his multiple hits in the face with reality. It leaves the reader’s thoughts on farming slightly tipped towards the negative side… before Pollan introduces the second section.<br />  Pollan practically destroys the idea of “organic,” revealing that it is nothing more than a marketing tool used to mark up prices. He records seven days of work at a small farm – of grass.  Something that I would have thought to be unimportant to growing food, but Pollan’s beautiful – and unbiased – description of the grass farming method makes it seem almost perfect.<br />  The book is structured in a way that the first part of each section is scenes – the “pristine white potatoes” greeting customers in the supermarket, the “gorgeous stuff, black gold as deep as you can dig, as far as you can see,” on the farm, and his hike in the forest: “soft yellow globes of chamomile, birdsong stitched the thick blanket of summer air…” Then, he follows up with the explanation of the ethics of eating animals, the research on meat processing, and the reasoning behind corn’s mass production. The balance of textual scenery and hardcore reporting, research, scientists and specialists ties together the book into a highly educational yet entertaining bundle.<br />  Though dense – in more ways than one – every word of The Omnivore’s Dilemma is there for a reason. There is no chapter, subchapter, or paragraph just weaved in meaninglessly. It’s hard-to-swallow food for thought you’ve never seen before, paced to keep you chewing and chewing, whether you want to or not.<br />  The Omnivore’s Dilemma explores agrarian life through multiple perspectives, painting beautiful scenes with the same skilled hand that wrote three other New York Times bestsellers. It’s four hundred and fifty toilsome – but worth it – pages of “What? No way!” derived from the expertise and experiences of Michael Pollan.  The Omnivore’s Dilemma is chewed so thoroughly; he has hit us hard in the face with revolutionary ideas that leaves us with a completely different view of the edible world. Everyone should read this book.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The author is undoubtedly qualified to describe the experience of being a sniper; his kill statistics speak for themselves. Unfortunately, the only thing I learned in reading this book is that the Seals are heavy drinkers and strong advocates of initiation ceremonies using extreme physical razzing to prove what &#34;stuff&#34; you're made of. The marital issues were quite well described and the sections written by Chris's wife provided a rare insight into the affect his military career had on his wife. His exploits as a sniper, however, were told impersonally with very little consideration for the value of an enemy life. Perhaps this would be good reading for a &#34;video gamee&#34;...

B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter-in-law, but I had read it previously and loved it. The twists in the plot just keep you reading. It was a hard book to put down.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Better than the first book as far as action and suspense.  Terrible editing.  I highlighted glaring (I mean Stuff you learned in high school level) issues.  I don't blame the authors, I blame the industry that publishes before proof reading.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Good prose with an intriguing plot and lots of twists and turns. Baldacci does a better than average job of creating realistic characters with individual voices. The plot is a bit far-fetched, but - hey! - we're looking for entertainment, right?
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I thought this was a wonderful title.  It is a top pick for book clubs 2010<br />©2009, pg 320<br /><br />Awesome read but devastating, at least for me. I read this very quickly staying up late several nights in a row to glued to the story to put my book down. This was very personal for me as I am afraid of getting Alzheimer's. It runs in my family much like the characters in this book. I have seen the effects of what it does not just to the person with the disease but also the rest of the family. Heartbreaking. Like Alice I want to spare my family from living and paying a price for a person with dementia or other health issues. I too have a plan but can you carry it off if it comes to that?<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND<br /><br />Short summary:<br />compelling novel about a 50-year-old woman's sudden descent into early onset Alzheimer's disease. Author holds a Ph. D in neuroscience from Harvard University.<br /><br />summary from reading group choices:<br />Alice Howland, happily married with three grown children and a house on the Cape, is a celebrated Harvard professor at the height of her career when she notices a forgetfulness creeping into her life. As confusion starts to cloud her thinking and her memory begins to fail her, she receives a devastating diagnosis: early onset Alzheimer's disease. Fiercely independent, Alice struggles to maintain her lifestyle and live in the moment, even as her sense of self is being stripped away. In turns heartbreaking, inspiring and terrifying, Still Alice captures in remarkable detail what's it's like to literally lose your mind...

0446572764|4.0|An amazing and thrilling ride through a Russia that I never knew much about.  Leo is all about living the propaganda as an MGB official, but when his family comes under scrutiny, he realizes what a sham it all is.  Demoted and exiled into a small town, he stumbles upon the fact that there is a murderer on the loose.  A murderer that the state won't even acknowledge exists because of if they did, then all they taught would be wrong.  Leo teams up with an unlikely team and journeys not only to find the murderer, but into the his deep past.<br /><br />Having read the books out of order and knowing some of the facts of the ending, it still took nothing away from this story.  Hard to put aside from page one, the story flew by as clues and people were revealed.

Having 3 Coen brothers alumni (Javier Bardem,  Albert Finney and director of photography Roger Deakins on board give this Sam Mendes directed serious credentials. It almost made me forget about Craig's previous outing completely. Great references to a number of past films and a great foreshadowing of things to come, I am truly grateful that MGM was able to get it together financially and make this movie a reality. Here's to another 50 years.

B006LMMN8I|5.0|When I first heard a few clips of his songs on an NPR music review- I was instantly hooked and immediately bought the whole album when I got home. I so rarely buy the whole album for any artist, but I love EVERY single song and listen to the album constantly. Admittedly, I'm not even a huge jazz fan (funny because my husband is a jazz pianist)...well, that is to say, I like live jazz, but not easy listening in the car. BUT BUT BUT Gregory Porter is a HUGE exception! His voice is like BUTTER. I could listen to him all day long (and do). I hope he keeps making more beautiful music and I can't wait to see him live in LA sometime.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Really easy to use app to set up alarms throughout the day. If you have things you tend to forget or just want to track your time a little more efficiently this app can help. I set up multiple alarms for the day and it reminds me to get up and stretch, drink a little bit of water or whatever else I may tend to let slip. Some people may not need this but for those who can use a little reminder this will do it and is simple to use.

B004HYDM0A|5.0|The most important quality I find with Amazon's video steaming service, it produces results. Not just ho-hum but stella. Not some or most of the time- ALL the time. Real interesting movie about real time events. This is a move before its time, really.
014034294X|5.0|James and the Giant Peach is one of Roald Dahl's most famous books, probably second after Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It is the story of a little boy named James and also a giant peach. You'd never have guessed, right? Anyway, James lives with his two horrible aunts, Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge (one thin, one fat) after his parents are killed by a rhinoceros escaped from the zoo. One day a strange man gives James a bag of something magical, but he drops it, and the magic goes into the old peach tree and into various insects in the ground! Crafty Spiker realizes that they can make money out of the peach. Eventually, James gets into the center through a tunnel, and meets a whole host of giant, talking insects! There's musical Old Grasshopper, the kindly Ladybug, Spider, the rascally Centipede, the pessimistic Earthworm, a glow worm, and a silk worm. They snap the peach from its stem and end up in the sea, eventually arriving in New York after many adventures.    My favorite character was definitely the Centipede; he can be really reckless at times, and do some stupid things, but he's so roguish and so hilarious! He loves to sing strange songs about various things, and I loved reading the songs, which showcase Dahl's amazing imagination. James is a great character too; he's small, but he's smart, and probably the most important part of the crew. I love the scene when they're all panicking about what to eat, but then James reminds them that their boat is a giant peach! The part with the seagulls is ingenious too. I also loved that there was a possible reference to Wonka's chocolate factory at the beginning.    The one thing that bothers me a little bit about Roald Dahl is that there are practically no kind adults. No, I shouldn't say that. In Matilda, there's Miss Honey, and in The Witches, there's the grandmother. In James and the Giant Peach, however, there aren't any who actually play a part in the book. Usually, there aren't many at all. That's part of what adds to the entertainment, but still, there's something not quite right there. I still love Roald Dahl though.    I'm almost done rereading Dahl for a while. Have you been getting bored? I hope not. I'm going to reread Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and then I'm done for the moment. I skipped rereading Danny, Champion of the World, and Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. There are also some Roald Dahl books that (gasp!) I don't own.    All of my reviews can be read at my blog, [...]

This book gives you VERY simple concepts and puts them in to terms that you can easily utilize in whatever type of web project you are working on. Some of the examples are dated, but it's not about the website being exactly the same today as it was when published (some are even defunct now!) it's about what works and what doesn't in concept with any website that you want people to visit!

1455527475|5.0|I remember reading Greg Smith's Op-Ed piece in THE NEW YORK TIMES about his experiences at Goldman Sachs . . . this book, WHY I LEFT GOLDMAN SACHS: A WALL STREET STORY (Hachette Audio)--written and read by Smith--picks up where the newspaper account leaves off.<br /><br />It details the how the author progressed from a summer internship to become head of the company's United States equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Along the way, he describes how Goldman Sachs  went from taking  companies like Ford, Sears and Microsoft public to becoming a \\"vampire squid\\" that referred to its clients as \\"muppets\\" and paid the government a record half-billion dollars to settle SEC charges.<br /><br />Smith tried to bring about change, and he even had conversations with nine Goldman Sachs partners over a twelve-month period  . . . but when they proved fruitless, he came to believe that the only way the system would ever change was for an insider to finally speak out publicly.<br /><br />Smith's insights included advice he learned from the beginning of his career:<br /><br />* We had a rule still in effect for all interns. When you're in the elevator, don't say anything. You never know who might be in the elevator with you.<br /><br />In addition, he observed:<br /><br />* Additionally, casinos may be better regulated than some banks.<br /><br />And he expressed a belief that:<br /><br />* People should be outraged that there's no political will to fix a problem that hurts everyone, enriches a super minority that has learned to rig the game and  could threaten the world with another calamity in a few years time.<br /><br />That's scary stuff, but something that must be learned by us all to make sure that this type corporate behavior doesn't continue.

B0050PYNN0|1.0|I can only rate half of this movie because that's all I could stomach, and it took some effort to do that.  I enjoy movies that are so bad as to be funny (MST 3000), crude language when used humorously (The Big Lebowski) and even hokey adult sexual parodies (the old adult movie &#34;Flesh Gordon&#34; was hilarious), but &#34;Your Highness&#34; is beyond redemption.  It has what I can only describe as a fingernails on a chalkboard annoying quality to it that borders on physical pain.  It was without a doubt the worst half a movie I've ever seen.  Some professional reviews I've read indicate that, amazingly, the second half was worse than the first.<br /><br />However some people clearly like it.  If you are stuck in adolescence and think crude language, crude sex jokes, and toilet humor are hilarious, you may be such a person.  You won't have trouble deciding; if you aren't impressed with the movie by the time it's finished with the opening credits, stop watching.  It goes downhill rapidly from there.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|R R Martin continues to write a story that is both human and realistic. Painfully human, you will relate with a the characters, even the ones you hate. Terribly realistic, this fantasy will without a doubt remind you there is no such thing as a untouchable protagonist.

B000Z27HLS|3.0|I recieved this DVD yesterday and screamed out loud when I saw a few scenes had been cut. I expected the same version I had seen and liked on cable. Two of the cut scenes didn't matter too much, but one (the one where Mr. Allen tells what he learned about the Tilney family, its when Catherine first learns that he is a clergyman and Mrs. Allen states that she knew he was a good man becasue he knew muslin) was important to character development and plot and I missed it. But most of it's there so I'll give it three stars.

He has picked up his father's craft, and you can hardly tell which Bonham it is.)<br />If you want a GREAT live album, however, pick up &#34;How The West Was Won&#34;.  3 discs long, and worth every penny no matter what the price.  The band in their prime. This is just alright.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I highly recommend this book!!! Another great read of Nicholas Sparks! You will most certainly fall in love with all the characters!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter and I both love this game. It's easy to follow, not time demanding, and the graphics are awesome. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
0345525558|5.0|What a beautiful book, both the story itself and the actual book. The cover is a stunning design, and different parts of the story have front pages with gorgeous calligraphy - it really is beautifully designed and presented.<br /><br />The subject of the novel fascinated me, the language of flowers and each flower's individual meaning - something that I knew nothing about, although I believe that our latest member of the Royal Family - Kate Middleton is very interested in the subject.<br /><br />I was also drawn by the fact that the lead character of the story is a foster child - I've worked for charities now for many years and for four years I ran a drop in project for young people that were 'leaving care'. Aged between 17 and 21, these were kids that had been in the system for all of their lives and were making that difficult transition from being 'looked after' to living in the wide world by themselves. I'd also run a project for young parents who had been in the care system, so had many memories of these children and their unique problems.<br /><br />Victoria is 18 years old and has spent her life being moved from one foster carer to another and between different group homes before finally leaving the system as the book opens. During her time in the system she has had no consistency, except for her Social Worker Meredith - a woman who has only displayed frustration and anger towards her. The reader is made aware that Victoria did once have the chance to make a new life with a lady called Elizabeth and this back story is interwoven with Victoria's present day situation. It is clear that Victoria and Elizabeth loved each other, but that they have been estranged for the last 8 years - as the story unfolds, we learn more and more about their relationship, but it is not until the end of the novel that we find out the whole truth.<br /><br />This really is a wonderful read. It is beautifully written and it is clear that Diffenbaugh has spent a lot of time researchingthe language of flowers. Victoria is homeless when she meets Renata, the owner of Bloom, a florist shop. Victoria has always loved flowers and their meaning, something that Elizabeth taught her during their time together. Renata recognises her talents and gives her a chance in the shop. It is not long before Victoria's bouquets become famous in the neighbourhood and at last she has found something that she is good at.<br />There is a wariness about Victoria - she finds it difficult to love and to be loved. She trusts no one and is afraid that she will be hurt and that she will hurt anyone who gets close to her. One day at the flower market she meets Grant, Elizabeth's nephew. Grant knows more about Victoria's history than anyone else and although this scares her, it also draws her to him.<br />I can't go into more detail or I would spoil the book for those who have not yet read it.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers is a joy to read. I loved every page of it. Victoria is a flawed but vulnerable heroine - a girl who is desperate for affection, but also terrified of rejection. It is a story of relationships and love, especially between mothers and daughters, and the added intrigue of the meaning of flowers only adds another dimension to the novel. An excellent first novel that I would highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is challenging yet fun it lets you challenge between your Facebook friends and that is awesome I love this game
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|There's really no redeeming acting in this movie. Don't watch it for the acting. Again, don't watch it for the acting.<br /><br />If you do like some great special fx and a plot line that will translate well into a videogame, then this movie will be right up your chain-of-command. The monsters are pretty great, the gore is good. And that's about it.<br /><br />Don't pay any attention to the acting, but you already know that, don't you?
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loved this book! Had elements of Anne Rice and Stephenie Meyer vampires and witches. Starts out kinda slow but picks up and leaves you wanting to know what happens next.
1926778537|5.0|Great book.<br />If you are into concept art, this is pretty much another must have in your library. It shows a great variety of ideation sketches for pretty much every characters, and they are all fun to look at.<br />If you are one of those people who are looking for production paintings / concept paintings (nothing wrong with that) chances are this &#34;might&#34; not be perfect for you. However, all the sketches and looseness are really great to look at for those who are into design. In other words, this is not a &#34;pretty book&#34;; It shows a ton of awesome thumbnails and these are much more important than well done paintings for students.

B00BHU9DUK|1.0|Full of wonderful actors over trying to rise above theatrical crap background. Who would think this story was so boring it needed a filler, rather overwhelming, hyper stage junk. The hubris, druggy world took over. Horrible
B005KELW26|5.0|very sturdy and protective and i hope this will protect the kindall fire form too much dropping or whatever else.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This Book tells two unique stories. One of truth, passion, spirit , and the other of preserverences of the soul in such loss.  It is up to each person to understand and tell themselves what would they have done in Pi's and Richard Parker's place to survive.  Pi's mind and soul have separation of feelings and life as trying experiences and outcomes in the story events occur. Richard Parker's are those of natures instinct.<br /><br />This book should &#34; not&#34; be read by young children.  ******<br /><br />It was difficult at times to read as an enlighted adult; but, I did enjoy it spiritually , reasoning, and fortitude as told by the main character.  I'm sure the ocean beauty and dangers discribed were developed well for the movie. The book was well written.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway Surf is defenitely a knockoff of Temple Run. But, if you like temple run (like I do) , but need a bit of a change, this is okay. My problem with this game is that the graphics aren't very good and sometimes when you swipe your finger to move it doesn't work so you die.  Also, it often thinks you want to use a hoverboard when you don't, so you end up using one. These problems are very ANNOYING!!!  If you need a change of scenery but like this sort of running and avoiding obstacles game, this would be an okay choice but I suggest Angry Gran run instead. It has better graphics and is more fun.
B00867GK26|5.0|Just updating my movie collection I already had it however my daughter wanted it on Blu ray, this is one of her favorite movies!
0316228532|2.0|I seriously considered buying this book just on the strength of the author's reputation as the writer of the Harry Potter series- I'm glad that I didn't. The &#34;Potter&#34; books were very long but easily readable, this book, by the same author- is something else.<br /><br /> I first read a couple of &#34;free&#34; chapters in e-book form and then checked out a hardback copy at my local library- if I didn't know better I'd say I had books by two completely different authors.<br />While I could sit down and easily read 100 pages of any &#34;Harry&#34; book in one sitting two chapters of &#34;Casual Vacancy&#34; is real work. Both &#34;Harry&#34; and &#34;Casual&#34; are very British in character so it isn't that. I think the author must've adopted a somewhat different writing style this time around- every time I've picked this book up I just couldn't make myself care about any of the characters. It seemed like the author just wrote down whatever flowed out of her mind without working so hard to develop anything.<br />A lot of unpleasant characters, more sex and &#34;cussing&#34; than in a Tom Clancy or other adult adventure novel (and in some of those I do manage to care about somebody), &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; was not for me at all. Plenty of people have given 5 star reviews but so many more have given less- some of us much less. Not a book for the kids or a lot of other readers.<br /><br />If you haven't read it yet, get a copy at the library first- and if you're like me you'll find yourself thinking you'll wait to find a discounted, very much so, paperback copy in a flea market or garage sale. If this book is JK Rowling for &#34;adults&#34; her career is already over with.

0307476464|4.0|I love Murakami, so I am not easily swayed by other reviews, although one very lengthy review was quite interesting. And I do agree on a lot of the points in that philosophy grad student's review.<br /><br />My take is that 1Q84 is a dream within a dream within a dream and as such stays on the edge of consciousness all the next day, sometimes longer. His books, however, stay on my consciousness for YEARS! Impossible to recant to someone what they are 'about', but honestly his stories have similarities to the hallucinogenic forays I took in my teens.  Unlike 98% of the novels I have read in my 57+ years at it, I can randomly recall a scene in either Wind Up Bird or Kafka VIVIDLY at any time. To me that is one of the most exciting things about being alive!!<br /><br />The staircase off the freeway! Making love with the older woman at the library. Staying in the well for all that time after looking for his girlfriend's cat and meeting the smoking neighbor! EL Doctorow has done that for me, Jerzy Kosinski, Kate Braverman....not many.<br /><br />And gosh darn it, I LOVED what Tengo made for dinner AND the way the hideout was equipped for Aomame! But then I always loved the lists camps sent out of what campers should bring!<br /><br />Happy reading, all.

055338466X|2.0|In typical Hawking fashion, the book is well written and does a good job explaining where he is coming from in his theory and views on the universe, hence the 2 stars rating (so-so).  But I have 2 major complaints against this book though.  First is his use of the terms \\"miraculous, magical, and lucky\\".  I underlined them in excess of fifty times.  That hardly seems scientifically or mathematically correct to use these terms and claim his theory is supported by the evidence in science.  Why is this any different than a creationist waving his hands and saying his God did it?  (Much akin to his claims of spontaneous generation.  But I won't examine that since he did not really explain it at all in this book.)<br /><br />Second is his failure to reconcile why he is able to use quantum mechanics in support of his theory?  His calls gravity the \\"cosmic miracle\\" and states it's critical role in the formulation of matter after the cosmic inflation, but then says that to date the is no quantum model available for gravity.  If he uses quantum mechanics as his basis for his model, and gravity as the key player in the formulation of the universe, then there ought to be a correlation between the two.  Of course he is smart enough to make the disclaimer that a good model uses whatever components fit (where quantum or classical) to make it close.  As a modeler of systems myself in a government research facility, that does not fly by me.  A consistent physics based model is vital, otherwise I can add what I need where to make the model predict what I want it to, rather than have the answer fall out from the data I feed in.  If I don't like what the classic answer is, then I just ignore that portion and change my modeling methodology and viola... I have what I'm looking for.  Massaging a model to an answer is not very good practice.  Models are to predict no matter what the inputs, not used as pathway to your predicted answer.  (ditto that for climate models... but I really don't want to go there now for sure!)<br /><br />It is a summary of his other work as others have stated.  If you're new to him and don't want to read his more elaborate works, then by all means this is for you.  It may or may not impress you though.
B0084TWN9K|2.0|My book club selected this book on a recommendation but sadly, most of us were not enthralled with the choice.  We found it to be depressing in both story line and location (e.g. we don't want to live in Canada). I was originally optimistic about reading short stories as it would be easy to pick up and put down in short spurts of reading, but ultimately found this form lacking in character development and I always felt as if I was dropping into the story in the middle of something, not in the beginning. None of the relationships in the stories ended well - there was nothing uplifting about the characters or stories.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|The novel is very different and entertaining!  This the first novel I have read by Toole but I look forward to reading The Neon Bible.  It is a shame there couldn't be any more works from this author.
B00B1OWEVC|3.0|This is the first installment from a group of talented musicians led by the famous Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nail fame, joined by his new wife Mariqueen Maandig, his partner in film score production Atticus Ross, and NIN art director Rob Sheridan.  After releasing a couple of EPs, this is the first full length album produced by the collaboration, borrowing a few tracks from those former EPs and bringing a few new ones to the mix.  The album combines the sounds of industrial electronica and harmony with often lo-fi vocals by Maandig and the occasional accompaniment of Reznor's background vocals.<br /><br />The album is an effort by Reznor to step outside of his traditions in Nine Inch Nails.  While I'm certain he would cringe and complain about anyone comparing How To Destroy Angels to Nine Inch Nails, there is still so much sound that will tug on your ears and make you think `hey, that sounds a little like NIN.'  And the trouble is that this release never really gets away from these root to give you something completely new, and yet never really feels quite the same as NIN.<br /><br />The album starts off with a pint-sized introduction track, The Wake-up, which combines some nice melodies and dissonant sounds with a hauntingly beautiful croon of Maandig at the finish, which makes you believe the album is going to be something great.  But then the following tracks suddenly trip and fall over themselves, often highlighting Maandig's vocals as the centerpiece but not testing her vocal range and not presenting any melodies or lyrics worth remembering.  The bad tracks get worse as you start to hear the influence of Reznor coaching Maandig to `rap' in his classic NIN style, but Maandig comes off sounding like the rapping grandmother from The Wedding Singer rather than having that real emo feel Reznor used to give off in NIN fame.<br /><br />But just when you feel like you want to give up on it, you hit the heart of this album.  On The Wing is perhaps the best track in this album, as it finds a way to combine the vocals of both Maandig and Reznor into a gorgeous lo-fi harmony, accompanied by the beeps, pings, and thuds you've grown to love from NIN fame, and levitated by some hauntingly gorgeous background melodies.  This inspiring track is followed up by a couple other great tracks in Too Late, All Gone, and How long?  In the latter track, you finally hit a song where the group finds a groove with Maandig's vocals, as she sounds natural, beautiful and perfect for the accompaniment.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the final few tracks fail to come to a climax, either relying far too heavily on Maandig's vocals to stand alone, or relying on the sounds of electronica to produce instrumental tracks that feel forgettable and boring, nothing like the instrumental tracks of Nine Inch Nails fame.<br /><br />The shame of the album is that it has whisperings of greatness, and yet trips all over its own efforts.  Reznor definitely tried too hard to coach Maandig to sing his style of music in many of the parts.  It's a pity too as she has such a beautiful voice that ends up getting wasted by this over-effort.  When allowed to show off her voice, Maandig gives the listener an amazing ride of beauty and emotion, but is only fully evidenced in one or two tracks on the album.<br /><br />How to Destroy Angels seems to be trying to figure out what they want to be with this release.  While the roots of Nine Inch Nails are there, the band clearly seems to be trying to step out of these boundaries but can't seem to escape them.  The lyrics paint the picture, starting with the track Ice Age which says \\"I find it looks the same, but everything has changed,\\" then leading to Too Late, All Gone where Maandig sings \\"the more we change, everything stays the same.\\"  And these two collaborative sets of lyrics epitomize the album: a contradiction of itself, never really striking that balance of new and old.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I had not read any of this author's books until Safe Haven.  It had such good reviews from those who did not normally like Sparks' work, I decided to give it a try and was overwhelmed with disappointment.  I wasn't expecting a lot and still was let down.  Vocabulary reading level is middle school at best and the plot is mostly transparent from the very beginning, with the exception of one twist at the end.  This surprise at the end gave me a &#34; you have got to be kidding me !&#34; feeling.  I have to give Sparks credit for knowing the right &#34;formula&#34; to use to put his books on the best sellers lists.  Figuring he knows that much, next he should concentrate on how to develop characters and put the English language to better use.

B000002UZU|4.0|Not exactly what I expected but I wasn't dissapointed either. The second disk is truely inspiring. To me, they could have produced a better product by condensing the 2 records down to one with the best tunes on it. Maybe there is more money in 2 disk records? Canned Heat really played well with Hooker and H haden't lost a thing. Good investment!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Well, I chose 3 stars because TH  book is really short, Jeff should  make it a longer book, so people can enjoy the book almost forever. So Jeff Kinney.... get writing on some new books. That's Ya, thank ya very much.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|One of the best books I have read in quite some time. History buffs should never concentrate on one side or the other, they need to explore both sides of the conflict. This book was remarkable in tracing the path of two veterans who fought for their country, a must read for the serious reader. For me, in keeping an open mind about why people go to War this rates up with The Forgotten Soldier and Panzer Commander, both great chronicles of German Soldiers, emphasis on soldier and not a Nazi.

B00B1OWEVC|5.0|I had only heard the How Long? single before purchasing this download, and I was really impressed with it, so I bought the whole album. When I was in high school, I was a huge Nine Inch Nails fan, having Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral constantly playing on my radio, and I expected this album to be in the same vein, but it was really toned down compared to Reznor's (much) earlier work with NIN. Still, I really enjoyed this album. My tastes have changed a lot over the years, and the sometimes mellow songs on Welcome Oblivion mesh really well with where I'm at now in my musical taste. If you're looking for something NIN-ish, you will be severely disappointed with How To Destroy Angels' newest release, but if you are looking for the genius that Reznor still exudes, you will really like this.

B004D0YB5S|5.0|I found out about Charles Bradley through listening to the Menahan Street Band less than a week ago.  What kills me is I've listened to them for years and I'm just now learning the ways of Charles.  This music is so good I can't believe it's less than 3 years old.  It is taken from another time and implanted here for our benefit.  After just a bit of research, you'll find that Bradley was a James Brown impersonator (literally) for a very long time.  He is making his debut at 62 years old.  It is truly remarkable.  The entire LP is through and through some of the best music made in the last 30 years.  This is not an understatement.<br /><br />There simply aren't many others, if any, that make this level of soul music anymore.  From the 1st track, which is the single from this LP, to the Nirvana cover, \\"Stay Away\\", every single song resonates and grows on you after multiple listens.  There isn't a single pop song on here.  It's all soul, baby.  A lot of old school soul records were notorious for having at least one garbage / throw-away track on each album.  Charles Bradley does us the service of forgoing that tradition.<br /><br />Buy this LP.  Buy all of his 45s.  Long Live Daptone Records.  Long Live Charles Bradley.

B009FZHYKU|3.0|Andrew Lincoln's character Rick and his mental fatigue has been a terrible idea. He and the director should be made to fight zombies.  And the other British actor playing the governor is too too much.  Bad writing, bad directing, who knows. But it is not working this season.

B004XUMPFQ|4.0|If you are more than just a passing fan of Sci-Fi, you should watch every episode of this show. You will then love every episode of the show, and you will be brokenhearted when you reach the end of the single season that was Firefly. You will then realize, as I have, that this show was bound to fail on network TV.<br /><br />On paper, the premise is pretty silly. After using up all of its natural resources, the human race leaves Earth. Without warp drive, somehow humans make it to another solar system with a bunch of planets that they then terraform. The series is completely set-up as a post-civil-war, frontier narrative, complete with hookers with a heart of gold, hard on the outside/soft on the inside outlaws, gunmen (presumably) turned preachers, and even savages.  The characters talk like characters from an old black and white western. They shoot bullets. They ride on horses and in spaceships shaped like horses. There is no framework for this show to work on a scale large enough to sustain it on a huge network like Fox. I try to tell people why they should watch the show, but I end up saying \\"Screw it; just watch. You'll get into it.\\" Like Serenity herself, this show should not work. But it does, and we love it.<br /><br />There are plot elements that are great. For example, the mix of American and Chinese culture is very well done because it is so understated. I love the idea of a space epic with no warp drive, where space travel is difficult and where people are just trying to scrap out a living. Also, all of the mismatched space and western elements just work. I watched every episode, one right after the other, and continue (as many of the rest of you do) to feel a loss that there weren't more. Where's our last dance at Vic's Las Vegas Lounge?<br /><br />The glue that holds this mismatch together is the excellent ensemble cast. The interactions between the characters seem genuine, even touching at times. Even though the characters themselves are generally stock, much of their interactions and story lines challenge their stock elements, making for an interesting approach to character development. Think Jayne being confronted by his misunderstood heroism in \\"Jaynestown\\" or Inara's doppelganger, Nandi, in \\"Heart of Gold.\\" Of course, we all want to know what happens to River, and we all want to see more development of Saffron and Jubal.<br /><br />It's the connection to the characters that make me feel the loss, and it's what will instantly addict you to this show should you choose to watch it.ck, much of their interactions and story lines challenge their stock elements, making for an interesting approach to character development.

0061245097|5.0|AWESOME BOOK!!!! Start at the beginning so that you can truely understand the unique relationship between Cat and Bones and the FBI she is involved with. I promise, you will love Jeaniene Frost's Night World books! Check on the website for an actual numerical list of these books, because there are more than just the Cat and Bones books that you will need to read in order to fully understand what the heck Cat is talking about in the &#34;4th&#34; book which is actually the 6th book in the &#34;Night World series&#34;. Jeaniene Frost refers to things that happen in her other Night World books so it is just more fun to read them as they came out then just the books that are strickly Cat and Bones.

B007VDN1PA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo185YCW61GX414]]I have been a photographer for 45 years and I enjoy shooting photos at family get togethers, vacations and weddings.  In the old days almost all of my photos were with 35 MM color film or B/W film.  Now I use high resolution digital cameras.<br /><br />This excellent scanner allows you to convert your old film into high resolution JPEG photos that are 5 or 10 Mega pixels in size.  It will scan 35 mm color film, black and white film and slides.  This is all selectable in the device in the setup mode.  The unit has a color LCD display so you can see your photos and you can flip them, make mirror images and adjust the brightness to get a good copy.<br /><br />It comes with:<br />* The scanner<br />* An AC wall power supply<br />* A USB cable to power it or to connect it to your computer<br />* A cable to connect the scanner to your TV<br />* A film holder for strip film<br />* A film/slide holder for single pieces of film or slides<br />* An instruction book<br />* A film removal strip<br /><br />The unit is compatible with both Mac and PC computers and it requires no software.  When it is plugged into your computer it looks like a hard drive and you can transfer the photos to your computer for further editing or posting.  The photos are stored on a SD card and the storage and conversion is fast and easy.  Make sure that you use a 32 GIG memory SD card or smaller and that it is formatted in FAT32 format.  SD cards larger than 32 GIG use exFat and that formatting is not compatible with the scanner.<br />Make sure that you are careful not to scratch the plastic film holders and that they and the film are not dusty.  Every speck of dust will be a spot on your converted photo so extra care in cleaning will produce a better final result.  If your film holders get scratched you can purchase additional ones on Amazon here:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00A6GROIO DB-Tech Replacement Film Holders for DB-FS150 Film Slide and Negative Scanner - 3x Strip Film and 1x Single Frame holder]]<br /><br />What I like is that you can convert your film into JPEG photos without the use of a computer and it is fast and easy.  I hope the video is helpful to you in making your purchasing decision.  My wife and I love this product and we are beginning to go through boxes of film now to be to convert them all.<br /><br />I rated this product as a 5 star item.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.x Single Frame holder]]<br /><br />What I like is that you can convert your film into JPEG photos without the use of a computer and it is fast and easy.

B00A2H9LK6|2.0|&#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; is one of those films that asks way too much from its audience to be successful. The original film came out six years ago. That's a long time for regular moviegoers to remember what the first one was about without doing some sort of research.<br /><br />Basically, it asks all its viewers to invest an extra 90 minutes of their life in seeing the first movie before taking in the new one. That's a lot to expect from people who may not feel like catching up with a film released in 2006 that critics flamed and many audience members were on the fence over. In a nutshell, &#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; takes a whole lot for granted.<br /><br />Another thing filmmakers expect from viewers of &#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; is a knowledge of the video game. If you haven't played it, chances are you're going to be completely lost as far as plot or characters go. The uneducated will likely feel as if they've been thrown to the proverbial wolves.<br /><br />It feels like script and dialogue writers tried to put together a sensible explanation of what's happening in the film, but somehow everything got jumbled up in front of the camera and when actual actors had to recite their lines. The whole movie just feels like someone is telling a joke and everyone around is in on it except you.<br /><br />For a movie that is 90 percent CGI, producers sure didn't feel the need to up the budget enough to keep &#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; from letting everyone in on the very apparent secret that it was entirely shot in front of a piece of green cloth. I can't believe a mining town in the middle of nowhere covered in soot and dust could look so shiny and glistening. I will say that the interior sets were rather impressive and did emanate a sense of grime and claustrophobia.<br /><br />The only extra feature included in the DVD edition of the movie is a &#34;Behind-the-Scenes&#34; featurette entitled &#34;A Look Inside 'Silent Hill: Revelation.'&#34; That's not much for fans of this franchise to get excited about. The Blu-ray version doesn't give consumers any more incentive to spring for it because it basically contains the same bonus material.<br /><br />&#34;Silent Hill: Revelation&#34; might be attractive to gamers who are familiar with its world. However, if you walk into it blindly with no prior knowledge of its characters or the first film, you'll be lost in a sea of confusing dialogue and convoluted storytelling that rests on the laurels of its gore. If you have a limited amount of time to dedicate for movie watching, you might want to take a pass on this one.That's not much for fans of this franchise to get excited about.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've enjoyed reading the second book just as much as the first. I will be quick to start the third.
B00A7OJ0DC|3.0|I don't play video games. Although I work at a store that specializes in movies first and video games second, I get the strangest looks from people when I tell them that. My first reaction is hand gestures that define how much of the store is made up of Blu-rays and DVDs in relation to video games. I didn't get the job there because of my love for video games. That's why I can't say I was all that excited when I saw the trailers for &#34;Wreck-It Ralph.&#34;<br /><br />After 30 years of playing the bad guy in his own video game, Ralph (John C. Reilly) is ready to move on to bigger and better things. All he wants is to be accepted by the other characters of the game and be recognized as a hero instead of a villain for once. In order to prove he can be just as good as he can be bad, Ralph embarks on an adventure to other video game worlds to win an award and the respect of his associates. His journey pits him against the ruler (Alan Tudyk) of a racing game obsessed with keeping a glitching character named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from participating.<br /><br />I'm more than positive that &#34;Wreck-It Ralph&#34; pleases gamers with its homage to video games past and present. The characters are all charming and filmmakers did a wonderful job capturing the looks of different types of old and new games. The only thing I couldn't quite get over was why Ralph and Felix looked so new, but their companions from the 30-year-old game still stuttered a bit when walking and talking.<br /><br />One thing that impressed me was how animators found a way to keep the style of the different characters consistent while being from different games and decades. Each game had a unique look but still somehow fit together in the grand scheme of the film. A good example of this was the blending of the vastly different &#34;Hero's Duty&#34; and &#34;Sugar Rush&#34; worlds.<br /><br />The voice cast for &#34;Wreck-It Ralph&#34; is an interesting mix of actors. Instead of the usual Disney TV stars and A-list celebrities we're used to, filmmakers dug a little deeper here. John C. Reilly (&#34;Step Brothers&#34;) lends his voice to the title character while Jack McBrayer (&#34;30 Rock&#34;) plays his nemesis, Fix-It Felix, Jr. Sarah Silverman (&#34;Crank Yankers&#34;) takes on the role of mischievous racer Vanellope von Schweetz. Jane Lynch (&#34;Glee&#34;) voices Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun from &#34;Hero's Duty.&#34; It's quite a &#34;mature&#34; casting choice for a family film, but it works.<br /><br />Disney never skimps on its video and audio transfers. The picture is clean and crisp with vibrant colors. The 7.1 surround sound mix makes the most of all the blips, bleeps, explosions, and other sound effects video games put to use.<br /><br />The 4-Disc 3D Combo Pack contains all sorts of fun bonus material. The theatrical short &#34;Paperman&#34; starts things off. When the movie is paused, we're treated to a Disney Intermission entitled &#34;The Gamer's Guide to 'Wreck-It Ralph'&#34; hosted by Chris Hardwick. There are also deleted and alternate scenes and original video game commercials included.<br /><br />Although being a bit complex for younger viewers, &#34;Wreck-It-Ralph&#34; will win children over with its mesmerizing animation and appealing characters. Its family-friendly fun which parents who used to play &#34;Pac-Man&#34; and &#34;Super Mario Bros.&#34; can find something humorous in as well.
