0345803485|1.0|I got about half way through the first book before I decided that I just couldn't read this series. The overall story line of the novel seems to be non-existent. I particularly think that Ana is quite disappointing as a female lead. I have no problem with the concept of a woman enjoying BDSM/being the submissive partner, but Ana is another female character (just like Bella) who exists solely for the purpose of conquering the heart of the male lead, lacking any depth outside of this purpose. The writing is bland and little more than fanfiction quality (and to be honest, I've read many better fanfictions). Outside of the BDSM, this is just your run of the mill trashy novel that you might pick up at your local grocery store.
B003VDZK8K|5.0|I have been a fan of Metal for the last 30 years. Some of what I used to listen to still does it for me, and some hasn't aged all that well. On the flipside, I've really been amazed by some of the new metal acts that have come along in the last decade or so and others just leave me kinda cold. Whatever it is the A7X has that a lot of metal acts don't, I know I absolutely love it. The tight guitar lines, awesome melodic metal riffs, astounding vocals, interesting musical arrangements of this record all add up to one brilliant package in my view. Nary a week goes by that I don't spin it off from beginning to end, much to my wife's chagrin! An easy 5 star rating as far as I'm concerned.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|This movie is action packed, racist, and knowledgeable. It shows how pointless raceism is and how it shows long term effects of racism and hate crimes. This movie was required to watch for a class in college. I got an A on my report. I highly reccomend this movie.
B00122HT04|5.0|I've been a metal head for 30 years, and I can unequivocally say that A7X is the best band I've heard since Metallica's pre-Black Album days. What an amazing arrangement of brilliant songs - I absolutely love each and every one. This album gets constant play for the brilliant melodic twists on conventional metal and hard rock themes, and the vocals and guitar playing are nothing short of astounding. The easiest 5-star rating I've ever given.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I LOVE SCOTTY and any time he does a new album I will buy it.<br />I just wish they would  play him on our local country station.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|This album is probably the most inspirational and it comes close to the quality of his previous album. All of his music is excellent. If you are not experiencing it. Slow down and really listen.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written and captivating plot.  I love an author that creates characters that keep you guessing.  This story gives new meaning to the phrase-\\"can't judge a book by the cover\\".  Worth reading.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Since purchasing these headphones, I have gone through Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B's, Bose QC15's, Soul SL300's, and a host of budget headphones from Panasonic, Sennheiser, and Sony.  These headphones are by far the best.  The sound reproduction is true.  Unlike some of the other headphones I have used which were heavy at the low end, these are very good at all frequencies.  There is sound leak with these but that doesn't seem to be a huge problem.  I also like that the cord is very long so you can move around some with the headphones on and you don't have to worry about pulling on the connection with your stereo/ipod/computer or whatever.  Would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone looking for great sound at a reasonable price.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is fun and you can make it challenging by adding more suits. I don't t find the ads distracting because for my kindle fire all it does is change to an ad screen at the beginning of a new game and there has always been a skip button to push. I play it often and would recommend it to friends that like these kinds of card games!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is amazing,fun addictive I love it.its hours of endless fun.I cant put it down.I suggest everyone buy it
0425263908|1.0|One of the worst books ever.  Who would stay around to be treated this way.  No decent communication or interaction.  The only realistic part was when the guy told her she didn't have to be treated & ignored that way she was being ignored at the dinner.  Alltogether a wanna be, waste of time and poorly written book
B0063IH60K|5.0|I would recommend. this game to everyone who enjoy playing cards and it is fun and mind relaxing and so much fun. Good luck
B004EPYZQC|5.0|GREAT CONDITION! GOT IT FAST AND NO PROBLEMS! THANKS SO MUCH! I love Amazon SHOPPING! get FAST FIVE NOW! my collection is complete till 6 comes out! haha
034580404X|5.0|Excellent! Couldn't put it down. I would definitely recomment reading these books. Loved the box set, easy to store. Ideal for a present.
B007RD4KQ8|4.0|When Certain People get together, you KNOW it will Always be Good.  What Started out as a 2 song benefit raiser for the Funding of a Music School in Armenia, blossomed into a Wonderful Excuse to put together a Compilation of RARE, INTERESTING, UNRELEASED, B-SIDES & LIVE Gems.. First off, the 2 \\"NEW SONGS\\": \\"Out of my mind\\" & \\"Holy water\\".. BRILLIANT! To hear Tony Riffing with Jason Newsted on Bass, is MONSTEROUS! And then there's Nicko McBrain doing his best \\"Vinnie Appice\\" impression! Also, a couple of Lovely choices of Beautiful tracks from \\"The Past\\" that are very much Deserving of another airing into the Ether, in the Form of \\"ANNO MUNDI\\" from the Always-Overlooked 'SABBATH Period with Tony Martin on Vocals. \\"ZERO THE HERO\\" from the Born Again album. \\"Don't hold me back\\" (1 of My all time FAV Gillan songs) from \\"Toolbox\\" is Tastefully included.  A couple of UN-issued tracks with GLENN HUGHES, Glenn & Tony are ALWAYS Magic! PLUS..a few rather Interestng pieces are also hear, from some GILLAN side-projects with weird & wonderful Names, that have Many different flavours to offer. There's 1 track that would even sit comfortably along side STING's \\"Desert rose\\"!  All up, this is a FANTASIC Collage that gells nicely together, even IF most of the songs have different Productions on them. THIS Album, i'm sure will end up a \\"Collectors treasure\\". One last piece of Beauty to mention, is the SMILE that will creep across your Face, when you hear the LATE-GREAT Ronnie James Dio singing SMOKE ON THE WATER with 'PURPLE & an Orchestra.  Enjoy!!
B005LAIGSM|5.0|A great job by two fabulous actors, and<br />based on a true story....I'll probably<br />have to buy another copy because I'm<br />playing it so much.  Gives me hope that<br />ture love is still out there.
0345803485|1.0|It is rare that I don't finish a book, even a bad one. I always have faith that it will grab me eventually and be worth my time. But this was so very poorly written I didn't make it past 50 pages or so. The characters lacked depth and were completely unbelievable. They seemed like caricature of a caricature. The innocent virgin turned vixen, the gruff, young, handsome billionaire that is inexplicably drawn to her. My inner goddess was rolling her eyes until I finally just gave up in disgust.
0151003084|5.0|i was so excited to finally make this purchase. i laughed my way through the book!!! the art work is great and it is tiny enough to go in my purse!! taking it with me made easy!!!
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Ok.  So it's August 23rd right now.  We're a good chunk through the year.  This is easily my favorite album of the year so far.  The tracks are just so well-crafted...it's the kind of great music that you get when an awesome jazz musician does something more like pop.<br /><br />Other albums that I'd compare this to would be Dapp Theory's \\"Y'All Just Dont Know\\", a lot of Meshell Ndegeocello's albums, and Lifted Crew's \\"Blast Off\\" and \\"The Undeniable\\" albums.<br /><br />Love this album.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Having been a Korean war veteran, I never knew the North Korean government was and still is as terrible as described in this book. The atrocities endured by the young boy is almost unimaginable. Too bad we didn't let MacArthur bomb the N Koreans north of the Yalu when we had the chance.
B007SGM084|5.0|I found to be in heaven reading that book.  It's relaxing but certainly keeps you on your toe.  I usually fall asleep while reading but not with this book.I would encourage to read this book.
B004PEJ1H0|5.0|This man is a musical genius. Composing, arranging, vocals. True Faith is George's experimentation with a different kind of sound. There's no question about his singing ability, hence why this is a single, 1 song in auto tune and not a whole album with 12 auto tuned songs. (Like some people we know)<br />Of course I am a biased reviewer though, George Michael could sing the alphabet and I would buy it. He's only 1 of 3 performers that I buy complete albums for without previewing anything.
B008C0C1Y8|3.0|I remember going to see JUDGE DREDD at the midnight show opening night (yes, this film had a midnight opening for some strange reason). It wasn't so much that I was desperate to see this film, but more that I was really in the mood to go see something at the theaters, and this happened to be the most appealing thing at the time. Being a comic fan, I was peripherally aware of the Judge Dredd comic, but had never read it, and had no real idea what it was about other than the powers that the Judges had, since this comic had received much more attention in the UK than in The States. Later in life, I realized what all the fans were crying foul about with this film, and I understand it.<br /><br />But for some reason, I just can't find it in me to dislike this film as much as I should.<br /><br />It's a terrible, awful film. Stallone is, well, Stallone. From a physical standpoint, he's a good choice for Dredd; muscular, imposing, square-jawed. But this entire film is either a grievous misjudgment of talent, or a waste of it. Director Danny Cannon, who has been working on TV shows like NIKITA and 24, is a competent director, but this film is far too out of his league. Essentially, this film uses a similar visual style (or lack thereof) that Joel Schumacher employed in his BATMAN films: dark mile-high spires of faux-majestic cityscapes filled with fire and violence blended with some very clumsy visual effects sequences. Then there are the actors like Max Von Sydow, Diane Lane, Jurgen Prochnow, Scott Wilson and Joan Chen, all of whom should really have fired their agents after getting involved in this film. From Von Sydow as the Chief Justice to whom Dredd owes his allegiance to Prochnow as the morally corrupt pragmatist who looks to start a massive crime wave in order to mass-produce genetic clones of Judges to Lane as the lone sexy and sassy female Judge who is there merely as a horrifically inorganic love interest to Wilson as the mad redneck evangelical father to a family of redneck mutant cannibals to Chen as the sassy and sexy female baddie that exists so that Lane will have someone to beat up. Then there's the eternally-annoying Rob Schnieder, just starting to ride the high of his SNL work of the 90's as the comic relief/deus ex machina who basically, like Stallone, is playing himself.<br /><br />But when you get right down to the meat of the film, the best moments of the film belong to Armand Assante as Rico. He plays his villainy with such relish and such force and such a lack of shame that it's really hard to not respect this performance. He got the role, got some really terrible dialogue (\\"Who says politics is boring?\\"), got the basic motivation of his character and just RAN with it. His wild-eyed anarchic performance is sadly underlooked in the pantheon of Comic Book Film Villains, mostly because of the quality of the film. I also love the fact that the film tries to sell us on the idea that somehow Armand Assante, while certainly a masculine man, is somehow a physical threat to Stallone.<br /><br />To me, JUDGE DREDD is one of those examples of how NOT to make a film, but it's an example that everything bad about it somehow becomes fun. Believe me, there are some severly skippable moments in the film (particularly when it tries to get heavy, which is only more painful), but when you're at the good stuff, you know it.y of redneck mutant cannibals to Chen as the sassy and sexy female baddie that exists so that Lane will have someone to beat up.

B006CEYM3Y|5.0|I would highly recommend this game for any boardgame fans who like medium to heavy weight games.  The multiple interlocking mechanisms in this game make it a treat.  Especially the mancala-like rondel that is how players choose the action they will take each turn.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a game. it is alright. you play different games. games are cool. you should play games too. games.l
B0010T0JC4|2.0|I gave these crocs 2 stars because even though they are very comfortable, they are not as slip resistant as my sketchers work shoes. I probably won't wear these to work again, but they will be fun, casual ones for me.
1469984202|5.0|I read, a LOT, and haven't written many reviews as it takes more than just ordinary to impress me. These stories are extremely well-written, engaging, and definitely bad for getting your recommended amount of Zzzzzz's! I found myself falling asleep at work because I just couldn't put it down the night before. Definitely worth the price and there are some other stories out there that go along with Wool that are equally engaging:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007UAUPZS First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series) (Wool)]]
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|Very difficult to get interested in.  The language was a barrier.  Did not get very far into the book and put it down.  Will try to read again later on.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|yes yes yes finally big numbers and easy to use one of my fav apps the kids will love it also
B001OSIV62|5.0|Wow!  I can't believe this guy pulled this event off.  I couldn't look at the screen several times.  What a great documentry.  If you are scared of hights in ANY way, this is a must see movie !!!!  Enjoy
B004MC8CA2|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN, GREAT FOR BIBLE STUDY  THE BOOK OF WISDOM WAS EXCELLENT STUDY. I HAVE SHARED THIS SITE AND BOOK WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Good movement when I have wifi, without it, you get nothing.  Could be a little more user friendly and easier movement within the books, chapter and verses.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|i love this game it is soooooo cute there is lots of monsters to choose from and theyre all adorable five stars
B000H6SXMY|5.0|One of my favorite episodes is the one where Jerry, Elaine, and George are at a Chinese resturant and they keep trying to get a table but for some reason they can't! The hilarious shenanigans these guys get up to just keeps me coming back. And the way kramer comes sliding into the apartment-classic!!
0345803485|5.0|I could not but laugh looking at some of the negative reviews. I don't know why many negative reviews but i have a theory. Reading some i realize they are all angry reviews, screaming that it's all unbelievable and crazy and stupid. I suspect i now why -the book has it so good that some cannot come to their senses and realize it's a fantasy! It's an erotic novel, what did you expect? That is why some enjoy it so much, it takes you to a fantasy world, away from \\"plain vanilla\\". I enjoyed all the \\"fifty shades of crazy and unreal\\". If you want to read real stuff- read Popular Science.
B00785P2QC|3.0|if you like to build cities then you might like this game but it has some drawbacks that makes it okay not that good
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It's a repetitive game. What do I mean by that? You run through the stage collecting as many coins as possible, plus tokens to use for a slot machine. Then, you use these to buy new power ups, clothes, etc. Also, one hit and u die, unless you have a power up then it's two hits. The concept is similar to temple run. So, if you don't mind this type of game as I do, then download.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This very sweet app does everything it promises.  I have had much better battery life management since installing it. I use my kindle a lot, especially when traveling,  and this app really helps me keep watch on my battery.
B002OSY2T6|2.0|We bought this toy to keep the twins distracted during a trip. It has been less than entertaining. For starters, it's very bulky and heavy for little hands. I don't know how far it was supposed to move or if we are to give it a push before it moved at all, which is what we have been doing. I find it hard to like this toy or recommend it. It looks very cute but honestly, didn't do much in the way of entertaining or holding my twins' interest for longer than 2 minutes. I put it away for a few months and brought it back out to see if they would appreciate it later but that too they pushed the buttons a few times and looked in the mirror etc but turned away from it after less than a couple of minutes. It might be a different, more positive experience for someone else, but this has been ours.
0375507256|5.0|I thought about buying this but didn't, cause I wanted a kindle edition but was incensed that the kindle price was 50% higher than the paperback! Should be 50% LOWER!<br />Know what? I bought a paperback at my local \\"friends of the library\\" (used bookstore - for the amazon censors who apparently think I'm doing something illegal) for 50 cents. Not a bad book, and I would have bought it from amazon instead of \\"friends\\", but NEVER at a cost over the new paperback price.<br />Get Real!!!!!!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Nice long chord. The sound is great. The mic falls out of the collar clip a little too easily, but at lest the clip isn't cheap plastic. Overall, a fine item at a good price.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I'm busy reading everyone who's popped up on the \\"also bought\\" links for Fairytale. Obviously, Slammed will appear an a *lot* of books' \\"also bought\\" links. It's been bought many, many, many times.<br /><br />When I began to read it, my first reaction was dread. Girl (Layken) moves to a new town across the street from cute guy (Will). Within a few paragraphs they're flirting up a storm, and giving each other long passionate, post-date kisses. Please, I thought, please don't have this be a whole novel devoted to watching these two cavort like this. That is so not my thing.<br /><br />But then Layken goes to her first day at school. Guess who's slightly older than the average senior? Old enough to be mistaken for a college student. Guess who's slightly young to be a teacher? Young enough for it to not to occur to his date. Will and Layken cross paths in the hallway outside of his classroom, where she's a student. The subject? Poetry. The final assignment, perform at a poetry slam.<br /><br />Slammed is right. Great title.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love love love all three 50 Shades books. They're so good I re-read them as soon as I finished. I could run away with Christian Grey!

B0071LLHGC|5.0|This is the best ABB disc I've heard since Fillmore, great music, well recorded, I love small venues, so intimate, the Brothers never sounded better, everything was clicking, am I using enough cliche's?, just great music by one of the all time great blues-rock bands, wish I knew all these websites to gab about, trade, maybe buy music by the ABB.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|having played strategy games for a long time this turn base strategy is among my favorites! fun to play silci fi game!
B008MEM24S|1.0|I hate it where's my water was fun but this is just STUPID its a copy of where my water why waste your money on this if u ch get where my water for free
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Good strategy game. The turn based nature makes it so you don't have to constantly be playing. However, It really needs an option where the maximum idle time per game is 10 minutes or something for if having a idle time of 24 hours makes a lot of games drag on for weeks. Besides. By running 20 games and making 1 move per day you totally forget the strategy you are using. And another thing, this game consumes battery like crazy. If these 2 points can be improved it's definitely worth a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Nevertheless, definitely put this on your list to purchase, especially if you have a tablet. Well thought through strategy game and looks great.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is the best app ever if you want a fun game that will never get old this is the one and if you want a good friend ID:cmergs33
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|this film has alot of cars in action on the track. i also like the special video on how the film was made.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|definately worth it.  games are fun and addictive.  you must play the games to earn points to buy more games but fun to unlock new games.
B00407PNY2|5.0|my first car was a 67 mustang very similar to the one in this movie. the car chases in this movie is real, not computer generated. it will never be this good in my lifetime.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I bought this game over 1 year ago and it has been fantastic.  The visuals have improved as well as the interface.  if you are a fan of strategy games do not pass this up!
0451529065|5.0|Great book and in awesome condition! It was just like new as you said in the description.  Thank you so much!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham's characters are always so believable. This story, about an ambulance chasing firm, kept me engrossed to the point that I finished it in three reads!
0345803485|2.0|I must admit I read this book strictly out of curiosity. With that being said, if this is the reason you want to read this book then go for it. I personally did not enjoy the book. I could not figure out what all of the hype was about. The book is definitely steamy and contains very graphic sex scenes; which is why I suspect the book has gotten all of the attention. However, the book is poorly written in my opinion. I could not get past the fact that the words \\"murmur\\" and \\"my inner sex goddess\\" appears in every other sentence. I kept reading the book because I thought it was going to get better and at the end of the book I was a bit upset that I had wasted the entire day! I only recommend this book to a person who really is curious as to what all of the fuss is about, but I suspect that you too will be a bit disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have almost finished the 2nd of the three books.  I have been very entertained to say the least.  Will definitely read the third book soon.  Wondering if a movie will ever be made and who would play the starring roles?
034580404X|1.0|I generally never follow a \\"fad\\", whether in fashion, music, books etc...however when more then 10 of my friends told me it was great and just HAD TO READ Fifty Shades of Grey, I decided to give it a try....<br />When I am on the second chapter and I start to flip through the rest of the book and reading exerpts, I know there is a problem and am not hooked on the book.<br />I still did read the book but it was more out of curiosity to understand what 40 million people could have possibly enjoyed...<br />My points: first of all the \\"heroine\\" is as boring as a piece of lettuce and I just wanted to shake her! Secondly, Christian Grey is portrayed as a billionaire entrepeneur dabbing into charity work. He runs an empire and flies his own helipcopter, loves the thrill of a glider and of course the thrill to inflict pain in order to feel he is in control. WHERE on Earth is there a man who runs an empire AND has time to stalk a woman just to be able to posess her?? I am sorry but I know of many powerful men who DO NOT have that kind of useless time to cavort with a 22 year old University student. It makes him look pathetic and ridiculous...he neither turns me on makes me want to have him as he is just portrayed as an imbecile....now forget the sexual scenes, I just skimmed over those as they are written like a teenager...<br />Also, so many words were mispelled OR sentences that were missing a noun or what have you....don t bother with this book and just read a Sidney Sheldon or even Jackie Collins which are much more enjoyable to read in that category of books...<br />This is the first time I write a review for anything because I feel I have to warn people that this book is just a hype and not even good reading...
1469984202|5.0|The story is amazing and riveting.  The writing to me was like poetry.  Extremely well written.  I haven't read anything like it and loved it!!  I can't wait for more!!

B008BIN9EW|3.0|I mean I thought from the descriptions it was gonna be more like civilizations or whatev but at first I was disappointed. the graphics are a little lacking you know. but after a few plays and I finally got a hang of it I really have grown to like this game. now. why 3 stars.?  because I don't belive its worth 5 dollars or even 4. but it is a great game.
B00003CXBK|5.0|When I came across this video I had major nostalgia, so I knew I had to order it. It played perfectly on my TV. No scratches; no damage at all. On top of that it shipped very quickly. I'll definitely be buying from here again! :)
B007VDN1PA|4.0|The device is decent, not super quality of digital pictures, but helps salvage memories fading away from the film. Don't recommend running it for a long time - it somehow loses sharpness. Produces decent results if limited to less than 1hr session.<br />Easy to operate, a lot of fun in a process
0521664357|5.0|I like this book very much. All the contents are oriented to help your vocabulary grow and help you to be more confident. I must wait 6 weeks to receive it but finally I think it was a great purchase! I strongly recommend it!!

Thoroughly enjoyed her diversion from the usual in this book.  Was a little disappointed in the<br />ending, but the rest of the book was worth reading.  Language \\"flash\\", beware if your profanity quotient is low
B000002IR7|4.0|I LOVED hearing Green Onions on the car radio as a kid!  We had just inherited my Grandma's old '48 Studebaker, and it was just then that Green Onions was always on the radio as my dad drove around (I was in 5th grade).  It was such a cool sound, and song, and became almost part of the old car, and really was the theme of those months when it was up on the charts.  Funny, I NEVER knew the name of that song until VERY recently!  I just knew it was something by Booker T and M.G.s (and what a cool name for a group!)  So yes, get this CD to get that song, and welcome to the world of finding out what the rest of that old albumn sounded like.  Doesn't sizzle like G.O., but cetainly worth putting on when you are relaxing in the garden or on the porch, and don't want to stare at computer screens or TVs.
0060853972|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book because of Neil Gaiman, but was disappointed that this was basically a Terry Pratchett disc world book.  The usual Monty Python humor found in disc world is here.  I love the disc world series, but it can get repetitive.  I didn't see much of Gaiman's writing here, I wouldn't be surprised if he wrote very little of this book.

Also, I have a \\"claw\\" grip and my brother has the \\"full hand\\" grip. He uses my mouse and loves it also. It works for everyone! All I can say is believe me when I tell you this is an amazing mouse. I understand that picking the right mouse is hard but you won't be disappointed with the R.A.T 3! :D
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The book is magnificently written. In all honesty, I never thought of Stephen King as a literary master, but this was truly a great work. (Well, at least the first four-fifths or so.) It IS a \\"cannot put it down\\" type of book. You will be captivated and the book should definitely be on your TO READ LIST.<br /><br />However, having said that, I felt that the final outcome was quite a letdown. The writing was brilliant up to the climax of the story, but then it seemed to fall apart rather quickly. I felt that Mr. King reached the height of the story, and then not sure how to end it, just ended it.<br /><br />I read in the Afterword that his son actually wrote the ending for the book. I wonder if Mr. King did write an ending .... because I would like to read it if he did.<br /><br />In the end, and in spite of the end, I have to recommend the book.
B004QL7K8E|4.0|It's funny and I think for the most part entertaining... it's more of a non-real life documentary but if you like crazy parties and comedy then I would definitely recommend seeing it.
0812993292|5.0|I give five stars to THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY by Rachel Joyce.<br /><br />Harold Fry is a recently retired gentleman who feels as if he's failed as a father to David and husband to Maureen. David never communicates with Harold except through Maureen.<br />He gets a letter from Queenie,a woman with whom he worked twenty years in the past, telling him that she has inoperable cancer and thanking him for his kindness to her when they worked together.<br />He writes a note back to her, but instead of posting it, he bypasses the letter box, and the post office and just keeps walking. He calls the hospice hospital and tells them to give Queenie a message to keep living -- that he's walking to her.<br />And so begins the five-hundred mile journey of Harold, without his cell phone, wearing yachting shoes, and with no plans of how he'll survive.<br /><br />There's no way anyone can do justice to this book in a review. I know it's now on my FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL TIMES LIST and I'm telling everyone I know. This book will move you in all kinds of ways.

B002GYI9C4|5.0|I have a new favorite author! I literally devoured this book. As author of paranormal fantasy, [[ASIN:B0082HNVAY Celtic Shores, Book 2 in the Celtic Steel Series]], I understand the subtle nuances and symbolism that make this work such a unique, mind-bending thrill ride.  This enchanting fantasy novel will take you down philosophical paths that will keep you reeling for weeks.  Brilliant - simply brilliant.
B000002I53|5.0|The music in MY FAVORITE THINGS is almost too gorgeous for words.  Picture yourself in any emotional state which you would call desirable; this jazz would be either a perfect accompaniment or a way to get there.  Coltrane is obviously at his transcendent best here, and the subtlety of McCoy Tyner's playing fills in the spaces with chords and melodies which keep up with the solid rhythm section. A masterpiece and a delight.

1439190275|5.0|As the author of The Three Diets Solution and The Path To Mindful Eating: Overcoming Emotional Eating and Adapting The Weight Loss Mindset, I've done a great deal of research into weight loss, adiposity, psychology, and more, all in my effort to lose weight successfully and keep that weight off.  Reading this book is a return to form of a diet that has been kicked around, rejected, and insulted for years.<br /><br />Things we should all know.  Carbs have become the enemy.  Whether you are watching The Biggest Loser, reading The China Study, watching Dr. Oz, or listening to Forks over Knives, no one now denies that pasta, potatoes, bread, and other easily digestible carbs are the leading cause of obesity in America today.  The major attack on this book is not then does the diet work, but rather, is it healthy.  Can someone on a high fat diet live a normal and healthy life, is staying in a state of ketosis good for the body, or, will it make you a pretty corpse.  Now, these are major and important questions to ask, and with due dilligence once should begin to come to a better answer.<br /><br />The problem seems to be that radical vegans, people who are anti-meat, which is to say, even if this diet was to come out as being the most healthiest form, they would simply change their platform to caring for animals even more.  See, stalwart opinion is not science, and, when you do the research, as Gary Taubes does, you realize their is little science in nutrition.  It's all politics.  Which leads me back to this book.<br /><br />Dr. Atkins revolutionized the diet world with the belief that you can eat all the meat you want and still lose weight.  Medical associations tried to take away his license, a radical dietary group put a bounty on the diet's head offering doctors tens of thousands of dollars if they can show a verified case that the diet led to a death.  None of these things worked.  Atkins still lives even though the man has died.<br /><br />This new book is a testament to the science that has been done to prove his theories and beliefs accurate, and, to discover that one doesn't have to eat all the fat, and in fact that the Atkins diet can work for vegetarians, and even Vegans.  That's right, this new flexible book, lays out a plan for everyone in every scenario, for which is what science is meant to do.<br /><br />Carbohydrates are the villian to many people--especially those who are carb sensitive--and in this book, you learn steadfast rules that can help you shed the weight and feel great, no matter if you adapt the complete diet, or if you modify it for your comfort.<br /><br />As I say in both my books, Weight Loss Is Easy once you find what works for you.  And this, I do believe, can work for everyone.ment to the science that has been done to prove his theories and beliefs accurate, and, to discover that one doesn't have to eat all the fat, and in fact that the Atkins diet can work for vegetarians, and even Vegans.

B0034G4P94|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I can't believe it wasn't a bigger hit at the box office. Nick Nolte deserved his Oscar nomination. He made me cry & I'm not a sentimental movie watcher. I wanted him to win the Oscar. It was the only reason I watched the boring show back in 2010. Tom Hardy is magnetic. He's got the \\"it\\" that it takes to become a mega star. The fight scenes were realistic, men should enjoy it. For whatever reason, the movie didn't catch on and many people who'd like it just don't know it exists.

030758836X|4.0|Don't get me wrong. Right up to the second-from-last page GONE GIRL by Gillian Flynn is a five-star book, i.e., it deserves the highest rating. Every page of the book builds more and more tension. It really is the best kind of book: unputdownable.<br /><br />But the end: other reviewers have said that it comes as a surprise. True. But I didn't like it. It is as if Flynn couldn't think of an end to the story so just stopped.<br /><br />The book's chapters alternate between Nick and Amy, husband and wife. The first chapter, Nick's chapter, hints of impending doom. But we aren't sure what that doom is.<br /><br />Amy's  chapters in the book's first part are her diary; so we get flashbacks of Nick's and  Amy's  relationship and marriage. Nick's chapters remain in the present. The combination builds tension with every page.<br /><br />After the first part, both Amy's and Nick's chapters are in the present. Now Nick has a better understanding of Amy. And every page builds tension. Amy is no ordinary person.<br /><br />I haven't told you much of the story. But to do so would be doing you a disservice. Some of the suspense would be lost if I said more.<br /><br />Personally, I think the end should be rewritten. This is a five-star book that loses a star because of the last two pages.<br /><br />Thank you to readitforward.com for giving me this book.
0545128285|4.0|Nice little companion book for any follower of the Harry Potter Series.  It is mentioned in the last book of the series as the source of a clue enabling Harry, Hermione, and Ron in continuing their quest for the deathly hallows.

Interesting notes by Dumbledore are located after each story.<br /><br />Book was used but if I hadn't known better I would have thought it was brand new.

1451678193|5.0|Although I still have my Bantam paperback copy of The Martian Chronicles that I bought in 1969 for 75 cents, I thought I would give my library's copy some circulation and just check it out and read it. After looking through the Table of Contents and comparing it to my old copy, I realized that this edition was a revision of the original. The chronology was moved farther out in time. In the original, it began in 1999 and ended in 2026. This version begins in 2030 and ends in 2057. References to specific years in stories have also been changed and there has also been a replacement. The original edition had a story, \\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\" that was intended to address the implications of journeys to Mars on the oppression of African Americans, as more of them decide to simply leave their oppression and second class status and start over again on Mars. The story is very dated and, with its frequent usage of the n-word, could be seen as very offensive, even though I know Bradbury was trying to make a counterargument against racism. I believe he was wise to replace that story because, despite its best intentions, it doesn't really work and even though it's set in the year 2003, he is clearly describing the Jim Crow era.<br /><br />The replacement story is \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" a leftover Martian story that was originally included in his next collection, The Illustrated Man. This story deals with a pair of priests on Mars  and their efforts to determine if Martians have moral consciences, can commit sin and can be sent to Hell or Heaven. It is probably a bit more successful. For one thing, it actually deals with Mars and Martians. There is also a new story (1972 copyright), \\"The Wilderness,\\" which transfers the customs of the mail-order brides going out West on the Conestoga wagon to Mars.<br /><br />All of this is prefatory to a re-reading of this classic work of fantasy and myth (Bradbury persisted in denying that it was science fiction). In his new introduction (1997) Bradbury sees a parallel with Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio. I have still not read Winesburg, Ohio although I know enough about it to see that the structure is similar, interrelated stories bound by a common theme or setting and, in Bradbury's case at least, with a few recurring characters. The whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts.<br /><br />Like almost all of his stories from the 40's and 50's, the stories in this book valorize a mythical small town Midwest past i.e. the era of Bradbury's childhood and even earlier in the 20th century. Characters fly to Mars but still carry this idyllic past in their minds. The telepathic Martians even use this behavior as a weapon against the unsuspecting space travelers. Ultimately, however, the Martians are a dying race and, from the extent of their resistance against these Earthly invaders, they relinquish their planet to the humans. There are many parallels with the Native Americans and their reaction to the European invaders become colonists. Meanwhile, the state of the planet back home is dire indeed. Colonists who have only resided on Mars for a few years and have not had time to form attachments to their new world seek desperately to return to their home, no matter how close to destruction it may be.<br /><br />Like much of Bradbury's speculative fiction and science fiction in general, there are prophetic touches--wars that become progressively more destructive with advanced technological weaponry, commercialization and entrepreneurism expanded to a new setting, mechanized home appliances, culminating in a home that literally runs itself after the inhabitants have abandoned it (\\"There Will Come Soft Rains,\\" still impressive as the only completely character-less story I have read).<br />Taken individually, the stories range in quality from mediocre to outstanding. Cumulatively, they acquire a power and epic scope that have earned this book deserved praise. The anachronisms would have remained whether Bradbury had updated the time frame or left them as they were. That is always the risk a writer runs when setting a futuristic fantasy in a future that has not been set distant enough to be overrun by a very different reality e.g. time-bound works such as 1984 and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Nonetheless, as a product of its time, the post-World War II era of the late 1940's, The Martian Chronicles has earned its classic status. As I probably said in my October Country review, the stories taken at face value are often not tremendously impressive, but Bradbury's language and inventive vision bring them distinction as literary works.
0545123275|4.0|This was a fun, easy read. I loved how Stiefvater was able to take that well known werewolf legend and breath some new life into it. Her idea was fantastic and just a little heartbreaking.<br /><br />The switching off between two first person POVs was disconcerting at first. But as I read on, it was easy to adjust to. What I really liked was how each chapter opening included the narrator and the temperature. It doesn't make sense in the beginning but as you learn more about the wolves, it's an interesting addition.<br /><br />I enjoyed the fated, almost star-crossed nature of Sam and Grace's relationship. There's something refreshing about their feelings and the lack of drama in them. The problems they face isn't their feelings, but instead the very nature of being a werewolf.<br /><br />This is a great first book in a trilogy I would recommend to anyone in the mood for some romance and werewolves. Certainly not a humorous, flirty romance like \\"The Art of Seducing a Naked Werewolf\\", but just as good of a read.<br /><br />For this review and others, check out BookMunchies.com.

B003NX76BM|4.0|Frequently with her novels, Roberts presents an interesting plot to explore. The idea of a search dog/ dog trainer being stalked by a convict, who's back to finish the botched job, has potential. Added to that, we have the love interest, a new arrival in the small community, is a necessary but interesting aspect. He adds to the story because of how delightfully casual their relationship is and how it grows into something more without them really noticing. There's a sense of ease, yet discomfort that feels natural (despite the catalyst of a stalker/killer).<br /><br />Clearly a Roberts' novel, it follows her basic formula, which tends to be a drawback for many. But as a faithful reader, there is a comfort to be found there. Combined with her interesting plot ideas and ability to make these characters real for me, I feel it balances out into an enjoyable and easy read over all.<br /><br />For this review and others, check out BookMunchies.com.

1416955070|4.0|Jace is the good guy wrapped up in a deliciously bad boy exterior. His confidence and impertinence makes for a good combination when tempered by his inate goodness. It's not surprising to see how quickly Clary fell for him.<br /><br />Simon was the character I knew I'd feel sad for. Obviously in love with Clary, he's a good friend to her even if she's blind to his feelings.<br /><br />The story starts off with a running start with Clary coming across Jace, Alec and Isabelle as they were dealing with a demon. Things spiral away into madness from there. Clary's life irrevocably changed (whether it's for good or bad is up for debate).<br /><br />From the summary, I felt that Clary had plenty of potential to become a very annoying character. But Clare makes Clary a solid, teenage girl who's very easy to root for. Not perfect, Clary shows room for growth as a person that's fitting with a character of her age.<br /><br />Most definitely a book for any YA para-romance fan.<br /><br />For this review and others, check out BookMunchies.com.

1423140591|5.0|The long wait is over. Son of Neptune is out and available to any fans of the Percy Jackson/ Heroes of Olympus books.<br /><br />This time we get to see Percy Jackson in this disoriented, amnesiac state. Due to Juno's (Hera for those more accustomed to the gods' Greek counterparts) meddling, Percy has been left without memories and placed in the hands of a \\"rival\\" camp, Camp Jupiter. The Roman version of Camp Half-Blood is much more regimented and ordered than Camp Half-Blood. The differences were interesting to read. More intriguing, though, was Percy's reactions to the differences, especially when he'd been unsure as to the reason behind his discomfort/ niggling sense of displacement when among the Roman demi-gods.<br /><br />Like how Jason got Leo and Piper to aid him, Percy's friends in Camp Jupiter are Hazel and Frank. Hazel is a bit of a mystery at first. Sister to Nico di Angelo, Hazel's abilities were kept quiet in the beginning, only alluding to the fact that her power was dangerous. Then with her blackouts, the reader finds out little-by-little more about her. Though potentially dangerous, Hazel comes across as a rather soft-spoken follower. But as the book goes on, the reader gets to see her pull her weight and tackle her \\"fate\\" head-on.<br /><br />Frank is the one who changed the most throughout the course of the book. When we first met him, he came off as ditzy. He was sweet, clearly enamored with Hazel, but not as cool as Percy. However as the story progressed, it was becoming clearer that while Frank suffered from low self-esteem in his abilities, he was far from just uselessly tagging along with Hazel and Percy. Frank plays his part, and doesn't let the reader down.<br /><br />There's just so much I want to talk about, but can't for fear of spoilers. Instead, I'll just say that this is most definitely a recommended read. If you like the Percy Jacson/ Heroes of Olympus series, this book is one you wouldn't want to miss. If you haven't read any of Rick Riordan's books, then go start with \\"The Lightning Thief\\". You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />For this review and others, check out BookMunchies.com.Riordan's books, then go start with \\"The Lightning Thief\\".

0307744434|4.0|At a very young age, you are thrust into a game you know nothing about. You are tied for life to a person you've never met and trained by a man you hardly even know, even though most of the world calls him your father. The rules are a mystery, and the stage is even more so, until one day, you're given the news:<br /><br />The game has begun.<br /><br />Yet the world still remains a mystery. You know not the identity of your opponent, and you feel as clueless as the awestruck patrons wandering around the circus thinking this nocturnal wonder a dream. All you've been given is two simple rules: do not interfere with your opponent, and above all else....<br /><br />WIN.<br /><br />I was very cautious beginning this book. The concept seemed amazing and it was obviously beautifully written, but everything just looked so.... flat.<br /><br />But I decided to give this book a chance anyways, and I have to say I didn't regret it once.<br /><br />There is a beautiful and unique world crafted into this novel while the readers discover how the rules work as the characters do. Nothing ever barges in too suddenly, and the whole story seems dreamlike.<br /><br />I love how the author interlaced different time periods throughout the chapters, only to have them meet at the end. At first I thought it would just be too confusing, and it wasn't until the last few chapters that I realized what was going on. I saw how two seemingly separate story lines slowly began to overlap until they reached the same, dramatic end.<br /><br />For a very mellow book, I thought the ending was very exciting. There wasn't some huge showdown like I'm normally used to, but the whole build up with the explosion and the foreshadowing really ramped it up towards the end.<br /><br />The only real complaint that I had was that I was more interested in the game than the actual characters. I never really got into them and how they worked as human beings; they just seemed like multiple chess pieces being moved around on the board while the circus took center stage. Except for Widget and Poppet, I loved those two.<br /><br />This book was able to use a lot of very classic elements throughout, but it still seemed extremely original to me. There were scenes alluding to Shakespeare's Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet, as well as a bit of James and the Giant Peach at the end there.<br /><br />I thought it made the novel all the more interesting.

0307949486|2.0|Let me start by saying, I'm probably one of the few people who didn't immediately fall in love with this book (if at all). I'll admit though, Larsson had an interesting idea. Partly because of my aunt's recommendation and to be able to watch the movies guilt-free, I forged through and read the book.<br /><br />Set in Sweden, it was interesting to read about a foreign place. The story circles aroudn the two main charachters: Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who recent lost a major libel case, and Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but largely misunderstood girl who is considered legally incompetent in the eyes of the Swedish law. Then we throw Henry Vanger into the mix, the elderly former CEO of Vanger Enterprises. Vanger is obsessive over the cold case, and now, in his old age, wants to try one last time to put it all to rest.<br /><br />Definitely an interesting plot, and a great set of well developed, flawed characters to keep us interested. But maybe in part due to my lack of understanding for Swedish society, there were times when it felt like the story dragged. More often then not, I found myself skimming through quite a few information centered sections, and the story didn't progress as swiftly as I would have liked.<br /><br />Again, I mostly read this book for the movie. There were several topics that made me quite uncomfortable (because I have the sensibilities of a maiden aunt). There were things like adultery, rape and corruption in the system. One particular scene involved Lisbeth and the scum ball social worker (or whatever they're called in Sweden), who makes his appearance again in the next book so I wasn't allowed to forget his existence easily. I'm inclined to believe people love these books for a reason, so I tentatively recommend this book in hopes you all find something redeeming that I missed. It's a slow start, but for others (just not myself) it does pick up as you get into the book.<br /><br />For this review and others, check out BookMunchies.com.
B004LROUNG|5.0|The Litigators is a great read.  Fast paced and keeps your interest.  The characters are interesting and the story is plausible, yet does hold surprises.  I would recommend<br />this for a fun, relaxing book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle some time ago but never really used it. I had trouble sleeping last night so selected my sounds, set the timer, stuck it under my pillow. I then slept like a baby!
B004Y1QKKK|5.0|Oscar Wilde can turn a phrase and write a double entendre like few others. And he is hilarious. Like Twain, he can point out our foibles and failings, make us cast our eyes down or laugh aloud, or make us cry. A man of flesh and blood and intellect, a man whose life was success and failure, applause and scandal, he could wring every emotion from his audience, having experienced them himself. Read him and weep. And laugh.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've tried lots of feed readers, and they all fall ingo one of two categories: gorgeous interface or lots of great features. Feedly belongs in both, so I've made it my main reader on PC and Kindle Fire.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|awesome and fun. great game to have...espesially when you just need to make time fly. I love this game so much.
B000001OAA|5.0|\\"Come down to my house, stick a stone in your mouth...you can always pull out if you like it too much\\" is the 1st thing vocalist Shirley Manson calmly says in a sinful whisper in the opening track, Supervixen. Garbage's self-titled debut aka also known as \\"G\\" is full of melancholy-psychedelic hooks, electronic dark wave pop noise and Shirley's deadly whispers and empowering words. The album is heavily influenced by Siouxsie & The Banshees' goth pop themes, The Cure's dark wave pop, The Smashing Pumpkin's melancholy grunge-folk-rock, & Patti Smith's sensible poetic Punk-rock edge and morph it all into a more seductive and wicked album that's all their own. A true 90's alternative-rock album for the ages. And it all started with this little pink & black gem. There's nothing sweet and bubbly about this kind of pop, it's all in your face in the form of a raging fist! Cuts like Stupid Girl & Only Happy When It Rains are absolute Garbage classics and rocks finest. You'll find yourself singing \\"pour some misery down on me\\" in the same hurtful manner Shirley sings in 'Only Happy' . Another killer cut is the vindictive & powering \\"Vow\\". Ever been hurt and betrayed by someone? THIS IS YOUR ANTHEM! Hearing \\"I came to rip you up, I came to shut you down, I came around to tear your little world apart...And break your soul apart\\" will give you goosebumps and the creeps! Your skin will crawl and burn upon listening and you feel the pain. There's a reason these songs stuck around for so long. The same can be said for \\"A Stroke Of Luck\\" an incredibly dark trip-hop track. think of Portishead but in a more straight forward way. Not once does Garbage toy with you, they're gonna let you have it! In \\"Queer\\" the band keeps it old school and gives the track a cool 70's vibe as Shirley plays sex kitten singing \\"I know what's good for you..You can touch me if you want.. I know you're dying to\\" & seduces audiences with her bizarre weirdness and cuteness before unleashing an unpredictable wrath full of eerie guitars...what a charmer! with all it's glory, don't be fooled, there's a little piece of beauty amongst the mist simply titled, \\"Milk\\". This jewel is simple but effective. So all in all & overall 'G' is an AMAZING album, it's high in production and contains incredible & relatable lyrics and emotions along with some powerful instrumentals. G marks the spot and puts the g in Greatness!
B008VKNEJU|5.0|British newcomer Jessie Ware's debut \\"Devotion\\" is a spectacular Soul/Pop/Trip Hop/Hip hop affair, with her smooth strong vocals floating above it all. She previously lent her voice to SBTRKT's eponymous 2011 Dance/Dubstep album on the upbeat tracks \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Right Thing To Do\\".<br /><br />Produced by Dave Okunu of The Invisible (the UK's answer to TV On The Radio), \\"Devotion\\" is sublime and atmospheric, opening with the soothing title track sprinkled with twinkling keys. \\"Still Love Me\\" features semi-chanted lyrics which Ware tosses off in a cool affecting manner. Hip Hop influences show up in the groovy \\"No To Love\\" with scant lyrics, a guest rap, and Ware questioning \\"Who says no to love?\\". \\"Night Light\\" is a haunting mid-tempo track redolent of the eighties.<br /><br />Everything stands out;  the piano sprinkled power ballad \\"Wildest Moments\\" (\\"I've been looking at you too much\\"), the quivery \\"Swan Song\\", the dreamy \\"Sweet Talk\\" (with gently upbeat percussion), \\"110%\\" (her sultry vocals juxtaposed with bubbly synths, haunting synths, and snippets of Big Punisher's \\"Dream Shatterer\\"), the soulful ballad \\"Talking In Water\\", and the glitchy acoustic \\"Something Inside\\" (with cascading harmonies).<br /><br />My favourite though is \\"Running\\" with stabbing synths, fleeting horns, stomping beats, stunning guitar squalls, and Ware singing as smooth as ice until she belts the line \\"I want to know is it mutual? Am I ready to run? Am I ready to fall? I think I'm ready just to lose it all.\\" Honest and heartfelt, as is everything else on this album. Nothing out of place, and everything in its right place, this should make everyone devoted to Jessie Ware.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Outstanding, my other reading is quite boring now. Look forward to more books from him. Will be looking either for more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I Love this game! It's like totally awesome! The story is cute and the controls are easy. Great game for any Ice Age fan!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love love loved the trilogy... Third book was by far my favorite! A little less sex (still plenty) and a little more of a suspenseful story line!
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I have ready many books on fitness / health and subscribe to magazines, sometimes there is information overload and the advice can get a bit confusing. BLS cuts through the complexity and confusion and provides excellent advice in a easy to read interesting book. It is not full of complex detail but rather provides just the right amount of information for the serious fitness enthusiast, I am a triathlete and still picked up some new ideas, highly recommend you read BLS if this is your field of interest.
B0017TFLBQ|3.0|Another Amazon review for this product said they installed this on Vista 64-bit without issue, so I felt confident I could run it on my computer that runs Vista Ultimate 64-bit. While the installation itself wasn't an issue, playability is! Bottom line: HOMM 4 was unplayable on my PC.<br /><br />It loads alright, but when starting a campaign/map the lag is palpable in the world map and gradually increases until it freezes up - usually within a minute or two. If you're reading this and have a suggestion on how to make it work on Vista 64-bit, please reply to this comment for other Vista 64-bit users and myself. On a side note, I'm running an Intel 965 i7 (3.2ghz quad-core) CPU, 12gb DDR3 RAM, and a GTX 560ti graphics card. In the meantime, I have an old Windows XP machine in the closet that I may dust off so that I can play these again...<br /><br />As for the games themselves: I played the heck out of Heroes 3 and 4 back in the day and highly recommend them.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|ok i love love love love this app why? awesome graphics great way to waist ur time im addicted get this app u will not be disapointed ^___^
B006LSZECO|3.0|I bought this book as a \\"splurge\\" given the good reviews i had seen and hey it was #1 on the best sellers list!! I enjoy a good mystery with a little bit of romance thrown in and this book definitely had both.I was excited to get to the end ( i had read a review stating the ending left you feeling punched in the face) and boy was i let down. I felt like i was left hanging,i really don't care much for an ending that leaves you wondering (unless it's a series). I am sorry to say that i wasted over $12
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A must have! Easy use. Cannot be without it. Love how user friendly it is. Carry with me everywhere I go!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|this is my favorite game on my phone. Never gets old. I've played other japanese crossword games, but this one is the best I've played.
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought this book was excellent.  I have already read the 50 Shades series and this book is similiar in storyline and charaters.  Both books have f'd up characters that need to work thru their issues.  I thought the 50 Shades was excellent and I think this one by Slyvia Day is equally as good maybe even better!  I can't wait to read the next book in this series!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I remember watching this concert live on TV back on July 13, 1985.  I spent an entire afternoon watching this 4 disc set which arrived in perfect condition.  This is a piece of history that i will share with anyone that was not born yet or was too young to remember.  Duran Duran was my absolute favorite and Brian Ferry a close second!  It was nice to see Madonna, the early years when she wore regular, non-designer clothes, had red hair and spoke American English.
1594744769|3.0|Please note that this book is intended for the 13 and up audience. It is from the perspective of a teenage boy and is obviously geared toward a younger audience (despite what one may assume by looking at the cover). I enjoyed this book. I found it to be a very quick and simple read. I think the story would translate well into film and that many young adults and children would enjoy it. Many of the concepts have been done before but that does not detract from the writing nor sense of adventure one feels when reading this story.
B005FISBV2|5.0|I ordered this Bluray set and when delivered the first time, one of my sub-human savage animal neighbors stole the package. I called Amazon and, without even asking, Amazon sent me a replacement. The first time when my neighbors (who....did I mention I hope die in a fiery car crash?) it was delivered by US postal service, i.e. lazy government union workers, who probably didn't bother knocking on my door. They just threw the package near my door and hoped I got it. The replacement was delivered by UPS. They knocked on my door and personally handed me the package, i.e., professionals. Amazon had to eat the cost for a replacement and I apologize for my thieving dirt bag, waste of human skin neighbors. I hope they enjoy eternal hell.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book I loved it.... you must read the first to understand the last 2.  but the last part of the 3rd book him talking aobut when he was a boy...didn't enjoy that as much.
0679423664|5.0|The condition of the book i received was great, it looked as though it had never even been read before and had just been sitting on someones shelf. Although i thought that it would have a cover, it didn't and the book was just plain black. However that did not interfere with the content of the book- which was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and finished it so quickly because i enjoyed it that much, and im not a very fast reader.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a game u should get because it is very fun and sill to u need to get this game please thanks
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app, it allows me to do multiple bible studies based on great topics that are relevant. Plus I can quickly access any scripture at any moment, from many versions of the bible.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I just got this today as the FAotD.  This is a great value.  Even if you don't like stategy games, get UniGames today just to see what it's like.  This is a bit of a learning curve to understanding how to play UniGames. But once you get an understanding of how best to use your units, it becomes a good way to spend your free time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a nice and User friendly calculator ap.  The design is clear and pleasing to the eye.  I use for a quick answer at work a d whenI go shopping .
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|it's still glitchy on the Kindle fire. the screen sometimes only shows the bottom half of your distance I think due to the home bar. and it also is a bit jumpy and laggy. I lost profit bird because of lag :( I was mad. really good game but please fix the bugs for the fire.
B008ANFRGQ|4.0|It's been a while since Steve released his last record. The long-awaited CD is mostly satisfying as it shows Steve treading some new paths. His guitar tone is perfect and diverse as usual. His ideas seem quite fresh while performance is always top-notch. Let me give you a short overview of highs and lows. Highs come first and they include (in no particular order): Velorum, Gravity Storm (for its heavy grooving solo section), Mullach a'tSi (perfect overall mood), Weeping China Doll (nice & emotional) and Racing The World which in its overall expression resembles his I Would Love To from Steve's excellent Passion & Warfare album. Yet inevitably the lows have too be mentioned (for which I had to deduct one star). The cut I consider most lame one on the disc should be John The Revelator with all this screaming choir - just terrible, I simply hate this stuff. Whether it's been added for variety or any \\"deeper\\" sense or story behind it, I couldn't care less ! The song is quite inflated and uninspiring. Book of The Seven Seals is in the same vein to certain extent. But luckily I regard those two to be the only real lows of this project. I also have to admire the idea of incorporating a declamation in the Russian language in the first song - brilliant !!! Bottom line is that most fans will enjoy the album for the most part. For those other who are guitar aficionados, there's quite a lot to admire as well. A well-deserved recommendation.
1439156816|3.0|I finally picked this up because it's one of those \\"must-reads\\" on every author's list. I'm not a big follower of King's, although I've enjoyed and been impressed with what I have (namely, The Green Mile). What's here would no doubt appeal more deeply to avid King fans, simply because so much of it is commentary on his own life and writing journey. But it was an interesting read for someone like me as well. I probably enjoyed his memoir sections at front and back most. The actual \\"on writing\\" portion is full of good horse sense from the mouth of obvious experience. But little of it struck a new chord with me. The memoir sections, however, were a fascinating glimpse into the life and process of a prolific author. King's open, honest, and chatty style is a joy to read (although those who cringe at the occasional naughty word had best steer clear), and, in the end, what he offers is a manifesto of liberation and encouragement to writers of every stripe and skill level.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I was so happy to find this cd as it seems that lately more and more the remastered copy is the only copy available. This cd is everything it says it is and more as it is classic megadeath. A must have for any rock collection.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game was totally awesome! But one problem I had was that I couldn't get the update on my kindle. It always said that it was not found and to search again. Is this a problem with everyone?
030758836X|5.0|Originally I hopped on this book's train for the thrill of being able to say I was reading it along with everyone else. But then something weird happened - I got hooked.<br /><br />The book's plot begins innocently enough (however, the few adult situations and strong language are anything but). The writing is interesting and very appealing to me. The narrators are writers and it is peppered with their inner thoughts. It doesn't read like a 3rd person talking at you from somewhere far away.<br /><br />Once I got to the Part II, there was a switch flipped and everything I thought I knew about how the story would go took a 180 twist. From then on all I wanted to do was read to find out what was going to happen next. The only thing I was disappointed about was that it ended.<br /><br />I will absolutely read more of Gillian Flynn's work. This particular book was the first GREAT read I've had since...well, a very long time!
0307390349|4.0|well written short stories, on the depressive side. a definite must read for those who want to engage in stories of the complexities of love and family.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Once again I find myself looking like a fool sitting at the break table at work and laughing out loud as I read another Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum novel. The characters are awesome, from crazy Grandma Mazur to the loin-tingling likes of Morelli and Ranger. Keep 'em coming Janet. Can't wait for more.
B008MM9630|5.0|totally cute and adorable. wonderful little game. have it on my phone and Kindle Fire &lt;3 I absolutely love it!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Amazon asked how many stars would I give the Emperor's New Groove, the answer is 10, but they do not supply that many.  The DVD is flawless.  It is my second purchase of that movie.  I have it on video tape too.  Hilarious!  Eartha Kitt was a purrfect villain!
B008E374PO|3.0|I'm a long time Owl City fan, and this definitely isn't Adam's best.  It's great to hear his voice, as always, but this CD is not doing his artistic ability justice.  See the other reviews for more specifics, in terms of lyrics and generally simplified song structures.  Highlight songs on this CD are (strangely..) the single with Carly Rae Jepson, and the last song on the CD, \\"Take It All Away.\\"<br /><br />If you're a new Owl City listener, PLEASE listen to [[ASIN:B002ECN4NM Ocean Eyes]] before purchasing this.  It has whimsy, beauty, and energy that only a debut full-length can.<br /><br />I'll still listen to Owl City, of course.  The Midsummer Station just won't make it into the CD player very often.
B000069HZP|3.0|Michael Douglas accepts an invitation to join a mysterious exclusive \\"recreation activity\\" at the insistence of his loser brother, and is then thoroughly terrorized by the game makers. It's a mile-a-minute barrel ride over the edge of a waterfall, with the audience left in the dark right alongside the protagonist. Young director David Fincher plays up the suspense gorgeously, but isn't quite able to compensate for a few inherent flaws with the premise. First and foremost is Douglas's leading part, a thoroughly unlikeable one-percenter who's such a Scrooge it's impossible to grow too invested in his fate. In a way it's cathartic to see him tormented by such a brutal series of twists and turns, especially in the afterglow of the Wall Street bailout, but the film goes out of its way to paint him as a sort of tragic hero. The plot's reckless yanks on the steering wheel, too, aren't all they're cracked up to be. Those constant swerves provide a great series of unpredictable thrills, but ultimately ring hollow when our suspension of disbelief is nudged too far beyond the coincidental. The entire closing sequence, in particular, is just so dependent on things happening in precisely the right place, at precisely the right time, in precisely the right way, that it left me questioning the validity of everything that had come before. A nice effort, and a strong-legged concept, that falls short in too many important areas to deserve high marks.
B008742O32|5.0|I'm amazed this app has not yet been reviewed.  It should be on everyone's list of Must Have apps!  It's like having a USB connection between your computer (Mac or PC!) and your Android device without a USB cable OR any software installed on your computer.  Airdroid works through your computer's browser. Once you direct your computer's browser to web-dot-airdroid-dot-com, your Android device appears like a disk drive within your browser.  From there, you can drag-and-drop, as well as perform other functions that you can read about on the AirDroid website.<br /><br />Amazon will tell you AirDroid is not compatible with the Kindle Fire.  Someday, I'll figure out what \\"not compatible\\" means.  There is a host of applications that are supposedly \\"not compatible\\" with the Kindle Fire that work just fine for me.  (It was great to be watching live Olympic coverage by using the \\"not compatible\\" NBC Live app on my Fire.) In many cases, \\"not compatible\\" seems to mean nothing more than that Amazon, for whatever reason, chooses not to make the app available to the Fire.<br /><br />Amazon's claim of incompatibility not withstanding, I had no trouble sideloading AirDroid onto my Kindle Fire.  I'm happy to report that AirDroid works just fine for dragging-and-dropping files.  Maybe there are functions that don't work? For me, though, it's all about drag-and-drop, which works just fine.<br /><br />A short tutorial on sideloading may be in order.  Google is your friend.  My preferred method is to get Dropbox on your Kindle Fire by whatever method you find easiest. Then, I transfer other apps through Dropbox. That is, I install them onto my Smartphone, use a Backup app to backup the app I want to transfer, and transfer the apk from the backup app's storage area by making a long press on the apk file and sending it to Dropbox.<br /><br />Others report installing the apk for GetJar and then getting their \\"not compatible\\" apps from the GetJat site.  This may be easier than my approach.It's just that I've never done it myself.
031620157X|5.0|The book was bought for my 13 years old daughter and arrived on due time. She was waiting its delivery very anxiously and started reading it the moment it arrived and is just loving it! It arrived only yesterday, so I can't tell her opinion on the complete book yet, but as for the first chapters, she says it's very creative and lots of fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my whole family loves the ice age movies, love this app because everybody can help take care of the community
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Omg, I loved this book. I could not put it down. I'm a mother of two and just had my 2nd baby. I would read it on my phone when I was feeding her ever three hours! I literally could not put it down!!
B008AWBQGW|5.0|This review is based on the Special Edition, which includes 4 bonus tracks & expanded packaging. It is not a review of the \\"Special Fan Pack\\" which includes 2 other bonus songs. It can be obtained through Amazon or Best Buy. As far as the music goes, this is very guitar oriented, 100% Pure American Southern Rock of totally BRAND NEW MATERIAL, from Skynyrd.<br /><br />I don't understand how any band can be more of a \\"Southern Rock Band\\" than Skynyrd. Skynyrd is the \\"Standard\\" when it comes to \\"Southern Rock\\". They were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. I've been a fan ever since they first came out in the early 1970's. I still have concert ticket stubs from the \\"original\\" Ronnie Van Zant version of Skynyrd. I've seen all the various line-ups through the years, and I've always loved every version of Skynyrd. I've heard all the pros & cons about Skynyrd sounding like \\"Country\\", & \\"Country\\" sounding like Skynyrd, but to me, Skynyrd is as Pure of an American Southern Rock Band, as you can get. Their songs are for all hard working Americans, North, South, East or West, and also for their many fans in other countries. Their songs address \\"real life\\" issues\\". Like Artimus Pyle once said, \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd is about the Real World\\", and that tradition continues in this new release.<br /><br />The 4 Bonus Tracks on this Special Edition include:<br /><br />12.Poor Man's Dream<br />13.Do It Up Right<br />14.Sad Song<br />15.Low Down Dirty<br /><br />This is the first Skynyrd Album (other than the Original Muscle Shoals Album), that does not include the late/great Billy Powell on keyboards. However, his  replacement, Peter \\"Keys\\" Pisarczyk, formerly from various versions of George Clinton's Parliment/Funkadelic Band, does a good job of playing keyboards for Skynyrd. I've seen him perform \\"live\\" with Skynyrd. He plays a Black Piano, in respect for Billy Powell, who always played a White Piano. Although there are no extended piano solos on this new album, Peter's piano playing is somewhat featured at the beginning of \\"Ready To Fly\\", & on the bonus song \\"Do It Up Right\\". Also, another change included on this album is a brand new bass guitar player, Johnny Colt, formerly from the Black Crowes. Also, you get some recording session guitar playing from \\"John 5\\", who has performed & recorded with Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, & Others.<br /><br />To me, this album is somewhat similar to the Skynyrd Album \\"The Last Rebel\\". It does not contain the \\"political messages\\" that were included in the \\"God & Guns\\" Album. Although it is Brand New Material, it does contains some references back to earlier versions of Skynyrd. For example, in the song \\"Last of a Dyin' Breed\\", it includes references to the song \\"Travelin' Man\\" from the past. Another example is \\"Mississippi Blood\\", it is similar to the song \\"Mississippi Kid\\" from the \\"Pronounced\\" Album. The song \\"Something To Live For\\" includes the words \\"No, I'll Never Change\\", which is similar to the part of \\"Freebird\\", which includes the lyrics \\"And This Bird Will Never Change\\". Overall, this is a VERY GUITAR ORIENTED album. Skynyrd still has that POWERFUL 3 GUITAR ATTACK, this time with Gary Rossington, Rickey Medlocke, & \\"Sparky\\" Matejka.<br /><br />In the liner notes, there is a statement remembering all the previous members of Skynyrd, who have passed on. They include: Ronnie, Allen, Leon, Billy, Steve, Cassie, Jo Jo, Ean, & Hughie. I was a personal friend of Jo Jo Billingsley (an original backing singer (Honkette), in the pre-plane crash version of Skynyrd. She will be greatly missed.<br /><br />I'm going to see Lynyrd Skynyrd live in concert tonight, August 24, 2012 in Bossier City, Louisiana. I'm really looking forward to it. \\"Can't Wait\\". I hope this review has been helpful. Thanks!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. Well I saw Skynyrd last night in Bossier City, Louisiana on their \\"Last of a Dyin' Breed Tour\\". I got to stand near the front of the stage. They started the show with the song \\"Last of a Dyin' Breed\\", and they also performed the song \\"Good Teacher\\" from this album. The concert was \\"awesome\\". The newer members did an outstanding job. The new bassist Johnny Colt, did a phenomenal job on the bass, he had a beard, and wore a hat with a Rebel Flag on the front. His style was a lot like the original Skynyrd bassist, the late/great Leon Wilkeson. This was one fantastic concert, one of the best I'm seen since I last saw Skynyrd with ZZ Top ,last year on thier \\"Rebels & Bandolieros/Skynyrd Nation Tour\\" of 2011.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|If you've enjoyed games like Advance Wars, chances are you'll enjoy this too. Beautiful graphics and slick interface. Looks great on Nexus 7. Loving it so far!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I'm not a lightning speed reader, and with my style of taking my time, it's absolutely appropriate for this book.<br /><br />Take you time to enjoy the imagination, plot, and character development. Let yourself enjoy this slowly. The plot gets a little twisty in the sense that you'll have to read it again to understand what's \\"really\\" taking place. (ex: the twins)<br /><br />It's a romantic whimsical fiction that cuts the fantasy out (although magic is the main story) and replaces it with flowing daydreams instead. It's whimsical without being ridiculous or too far fetched, but it's on the border to keep the intrigue alive. It leans more on a curious mature magick then say, the now-typical young adult fantasy.<br /><br />It's enjoyable. You'll be happy you read it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So much better than the other zoo games I've played!  My son loves to play the mini-games on it also!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't understand the meaning of the title before reading the book.  The first clue was after the first few pages....wow!  What an exciting page turner.  Really draws the reader in to the personalties to find out what will happen next and how so many complexities can serve a relationship so that it may possibly grow.  (I like the people and want them to succeed in life). And how can one abide these complexities even if you have fallen madly in love!?!  I can't wait to read the second and third books to find out how these personalities can move on and become fulfilled people, and without certain restraints (shall we say)!!  Great read!!  Enjoy!
B004UID2LC|3.0|I've had this app for over a year. It worked out fine downloading what I wanted. But with all the &quot;updates&quot; throughout, it never seemed to improve. The updates were really a hit or miss. Installing them would mean it worked still our not at all. Now that it's decided to work with me again, I don't know if I'll be updating it until it decides not to work again.
B0060MYNBY|5.0|why is it taking so long to get season 4 in the USA DVD format?<br />This is a wonderful series that we have enjoyed and have trouble<br />finding it on cable.  I love the scenery and sets and characters<br />and actors.  It's really well done.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst book I've ever read. The writing is heinous and the premise is absurd. I cant even begin to understand how this book became popular. They might as well put a picture of Fabio on the cover but that would be an insult to the semi-readable bargain bin romance novels. This is the definition of drivel.

B008N1V11U|5.0|This app is really cool. You can go anywhere, and i mean ANYWHERE. Batman has some awesome gear, like batarangs, the Bat-Pod, and the Bat. His melle skills are also top-notch. It has a very long storyline. Its worth its $7. I recommend it!!!
0345803485|5.0|All everybody talks about is the sex that is in the book. They don't stop to realize that it a love story. Like two people meet and fall in love by chance. It is not real people. It is for enjoyment and I love the concept that does involve two people trying to fit in each others life. I see nothing wrong with the way it is written.  I hope she writes one from his point of view.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|When it comes to the Alien universe, the first 2 Alien movies will always be my favorites!  After that, I'd say I enjoyed Prometheus even a bit better than the 3rd & 4th Alien movies.  It was cool to finally witness how the xenomorphs inevitably came to be...and I must say that this movie was pretty intense, as it should be!<br /><br />I have never honestly read the book, so I don't pretend to know how close the movie actually comes to it in comparison, but I've never been a big reader anyway...there are books I do like and will read, but my taste in sci-fi literature is pretty limited.  However, I love sci-fi movies!<br /><br />All of the actors in this movie did a great job I felt.  I had only ever previously seen Noomi Rapace in Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows, in which I felt she did very good, so I had no doubt she'd be good in this movie.  Then there is, of course, the ever awesome Michael Fassbender...I have liked him as an actor ever since Centurion, though his best role in my opinion so far has been the younger Magneto in X-Men First Class.  There was also the always cool Idris Elba and Charlize Theron.<br /><br />What it boils down to if this...if you enjoy good sci-fi, especially if you're familiar with the Alien movies (which any sci-fi love probably is), then I highly recommend giving this movie a watch.  I for one will be adding this to my collection once it releases!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is just the game I have been looking for.this game is super addicitve I could play it all day long
B008QE9VJI|4.0|I'm a long time Tim Burton fan, and not to mention Johnny Depp fan, so I obviously jumped at seeing this movie.  I went and saw it with my wife after it's release and we both really enjoyed it.  It's, in my opinion, not one of Tim Burton or even Johnny Depp's best roles, but it's still pretty good and worthy of watching, if not purchase.<br /><br />How closely this really compares to the old Dark Shadows series or the characters contained within, I have no idea, for I have never actually seen it.  However, however close it was or was not, there is no denying that this was an enjoyable movie none the less...and it has Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's signature style, which is something I really enjoy.  Some people say that particular style is getting old, but I say poppycock...I love it!<br /><br />If you're a Tim Burton and/or Johnny Depp fan, and/or just enjoy a good comical work of fantasy/horror type stuff, I suggest giving this a watch if you have not yet seen it...it's pretty entertaining.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a fun and challenging game. Wish there was less facebook stuff. It is nice how they give you coins
B001EN71CW|5.0|I never saw this show when it was actually on TV, but from what I understand from a friend when we started watching it on Netflix, he said it was good that I was getting to see it that way because apparently Fox screwed up the order of the show when they aired it.  Supposedly they had decided after they'd signed on with the show for the 1st season that they didn't think it would be very popular and therefor were going to cancel it after the first season...and then for whatever reason, they decided to just show it in any random order.  It did, in fact, become pretty popular despite this so Fox made a big mistake in doing this...there are so many people out there who would have loved to see this show continue.  But of course, Fox is notorious for fouling things up...makes me sick.  At least Joss was able to tie it off in the movie Serenity.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not often I buy TV on DVD/Blu-Ray...normally I'll just rewatch shows on Netflix or something.  However, I did really love this show, and I had Serenity on Blu-Ray, so I finally just decided to pick this up on Blu-Ray to go with it.  Totally worth while show...it's an interesting blending of Sci-Fi and Western.  The characters are all cool in their own ways...I think my favorite is probably Ms. Kaylee Frey!  She's like my Hollywood dream girl...she's so lovable and funny.  The whole cast adds some great character to the whole show all around though.<br /><br />While it's sad that the show was cut so short, the little bit there is of it is memorable and entertaining, and worth watching more than once...which is why it was worth it to me to buy the set and the follow up movie, Serenity.  If you're a fan of sci-fi and have never seen this before, then I highly recommend checking it out friends.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Wasn't sure I would like this movie (when in theaters), but now I want to own it.  Maybe cuz I am also a retired baby boomer struggling to survive.  Acting first-rate all around, esp. Judy Dench.  Unexpected happenings, which I won't reveal.  And beautiful photography of India.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|After seeing the trailer and reading a little bit about this film, I thought it looked like a cool watch but I really wasn't sure if it would wind up being the caliber of movie I'd want to pay theater prices to see...maybe more like a rental or something.  A little hope was restored when I saw that Timur Bekmambetov was directing and that Tim Burton was producing...I am a long time fan of Tim Burton, and I very much enjoyed Timur's movies Wanted and 9.  There were other bigger movies around that time that I was wanting to see in the theater, so I decided I'd compromise anad wait & see this at a local dollar theater instead, which I finally got around to doing.<br /><br />Though I think a couple of things were over done and there were a couple of kinda cheesy parts, I must admit that this movie was actually better than I had expected it to be...a great blending of history and fantasy/horror!  The characters were, for the most part, pretty believable.  The special effects were overall pretty well done, spare maybe a couple of parts, and the concept was actually pretty neat.  I do understand that this movie was based off the book of the same name by Seth Grahamme-Smith, and it makes me hopeful that maybe they'll actually make a movie based off his other popular book Pride Prejudice and Zombies...and I'm not even a Pride and Prejudice kind of person, though I do love zombie films.<br /><br />In any case, if you've enjoyed any of Timur Bekmambetov & Tim Burton's movies in the past, I would highly suggest checking this movie out, because it was honestly pretty good...not, I would say, my absolute favorite movie of the summer, but still pretty dang entertaining.  Give it a watch!  I for one will probably be picking this one up on Blu-Ray!

B004ZN9UZO|4.0|After the creative zenith of Wish You Were Here, not from just a commercial and creative aspect, it was also the band's last true collective recording as well. By the time of Animals, Rick Wright's input is second to null, even though his keyboards are still prominent throughout the record's 3 centerpieces Dogs, Pigs(three Different Ones) and Sheep, its much more driven by Gilmour's guitar attack and Waters' lyrics than anything else. The vibe of the record is also a bit of a downer and becomes increasingly cynical and caustic throughout its duration. The two acoustic pieces Pigs on the Wing pt. 1 & 2 are simple and sweet bookends within the center frame of the structure of the album giving a continuity to the record which unifies it most convincingly. Dogs and Sheep were originally written back in '74 and presented in different lyrical form and rawer musical structure as Raving and Drooling and Gotta Be Crazy, which are found on the recently available Experience edition of Wish You Were Here; comparing to the finished tracks, its interesting to measure the rawer incomplete versions to their studio counterparts. These two songs are essentially the base of the record and offer the solid foundation and success of Animals as a whole. Pigs(Three Different Ones) echoes a bit of Wish You Were Here's Have A Cigar in melody, but implies cynicism within the big wheels of society from the coporate machine of business to various aspects of organized government, lyrically. Animals is a time marking record that begins Waters' dominance over the group's creative impetus for subsquent releases from here to The Wall to The Final Cut(which, to my mind, is Waters' first solo album); and despite the increasing lack of input from the other Floyds', Gilmour manages to make his creative impulses known moreso on this release, and its all the more better for it. In the ensuing years, it is argued that without Waters, Pink Floyd lacked a true continuity in its studio releases post The FinalCut within an overall theme lyrically, while Waters' main issues in his solo projects lacked a sense of melodic hooks and overall song structures musically. Animals is the first indication of the two main factions of Floyd colliding, with the scales tipping towards Waters domination, but despite the downbeat nature of this piece, its still a strong effort added to the canon of Floyd's prodigious catalogue. 4 solid stars

B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Crossed<br />Matched Book Two<br />By Ally Condie<br /><br />Cassia is determined to find Ky after he has been taken by the Society into the Outer Provinces where the Society intends for him to be a casualty in the ongoing war. But after Cassia arrives she finds that Ky has already escaped into the mountainous caverns. Along the way she discovers remnants of a society that has survived until now and other startling revelations. Soon her journey is not just about finding Ky but also joining the rebellion in hopes of changing the Society itself.<br /><br />In this book we find out more about Ky and his past as he relives lost memories that have resurfaced due to being in close proximity to where he has once lived, the life Ky once had is so captivating but we also learn more about Xander and Cassia creating a more diverse love triangle between the three and the reader dying to know who Cassia will chose. This entire novel may not have been as great as the first one, sequels rarely are, but the more the story progresses the more enthralling it becomes. Ally Condie did a remarkable job in expanding the story into so much more, creating two other civilizations to coincide with the Society and adding new dimensions to an already fascinating story.
B0083GR6Y6|4.0|The movie was pretty good. Great storyline and characters, lots of action. Hated the ending though. Worth watching this movie at least once.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app, its Soo cool that I can change the color, those bad reviews that say it pops up every time u plug it in are wrong, if u can change that in the settings
0307346617|3.0|I liked the idea of this book. It's a different take on the zombie genre and I was really rooting for it.  Unfortunately, being a collection of interviews with several dozen different people, this book does not create any of the basic elements of a traditional storyline - no buildup of a storyline, suspense, or denouement. It starts off slow, stays quite slow, and ends up just as it started. I would say it's perfectly suited for a graphic novel (comic book). The writing is nothing fancy - just basic. There's really nothing artistic, thrilling, horrifying or suspenseful about the storyline. Basically, if you're looking for a book to read on the train or plane, then this is just right as it doesn't require too much attention.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book! It's such an easy one to read (English is not my first language - I'm from Brazil, which means I speak Portuguese - and yet, it was pretty easy and it took me less than a week to finish reading it).

0345803485|1.0|There isn't more that I could say that hasn't already been said. At the very least this book is degrading, demoralizing, and demeaning. Not only does it epitomize female subordination, but THE WRITING SUCKS. I'm sorry to say it so simply, but it's true. I don't know how many times she writes \\"my inner goddess\\" (I think one review has that covered), but does she even know the meaning of subconscious? The point of your subconscious is that it is a consciousness undefinable. In other words, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT \\"says\\". How many times is she going to say, my subconscious is happy? Um... Your subconscious doesn't have mind of its own. This book is so incredibly stupid I could cry.
159448385X|5.0|Wow this was an amazing read, one of the most incredible books I have ever read. This story takes you on a journey you will never ever forget. How anyone could rate this book lower than a five star is beyond me. I will be reading more by this author in the future...

0439023491|2.0|This series is vastly over hyped. The first book is good (not great), but is held back by its juvenile prose, one dimensional characters and sometimes laughable melodrama. Sadly, Catching Fire is little more than an even less inspired regurgitation of the first book with a few twists. The third book is about as dry, dull, depressing and uninteresting a book as you could possibly read. I can't think of any redeeming qualities it had at all. When the most glowing endorsements of a series come from celebrities like LeBron James, that should really tip you off that there isn't much there.<br /><br />I rate The Hunger Games 3 stars, Catching Fire 2 stars and Mockingjay 1 star.

1400069289|5.0|I found this book fascinating...and slightly creepy!  I had no idea the lengths major corporations go to track information about you and use it to their advantage, such at the stories relayed about Target.  And I mean REALLY track information...they actually created a computer algorithm which could pinpoint, via purchases ( not pregnancy detection kits)  which women were pregnant and target them with coupons!  How crazy is that?  But it's happening, and more than I - and possibly you - realize.  Also discussed radio frequency ID in clothing and products to not only track what is sold in a store....but where it goes!  ugh!  This information was part of the greater information about habits - how we develop them, why we use them, how to see them for what they are and the effort required to change them.  I found it very very interesting. OH! I should tell you, (I have a habit of stopping short - haha)  it has to do with how our brains are wired and conditioned to respond.  Obviously it would be tedious if , when tying your shoes, you had to relearn that information each time.  ( or you could buy loafers at Target and have them tracked to your house and whereever you go....)  So your brain makes it easy and the next time you tie your shoes it goes faster and faster until you can tie your shoes without thinking about it.  So it's a cue, a process/action and a result.  to change habits, first you must recognize them as such and substitute the action phase....you get a cue..say after dinner cigarette - you have one - you feel relaxed.  so now, after dinner - you go for a walk - and come back relaxed...and do that over and over again until that is your new 'habit'
B007SGM084|4.0|Good story line but an unrealistic description of a woman's sexual satisfaction!  There were a lot of repetative lines and words in the book which was disappointing, but overall they were good books.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I was nervous going into this retelling of Snow White given the spilt reviews. After seeing it for myself I can say it's a worthy retelling of the legendary tale. Kristen Stewart, in my opinion, was a great Snow White. I feel like Kristen will be forever tainted as a terrible actress by viewers because of her role in the Twilight Saga which made her play a character with no emotional depth which is very unfortunate. Charlize Theron was an even better Evil Queen. But like many other people have noted, her performance is a little over dramatic at times and I couldn't help but giggle (yes, giggle) at her extremeness. Chris Hemsworth did great in his role as the Huntsman and I didn't see any resemblance to Thor in his performance. The film barely dragged in the middle.<br />On a side note, Mirror Mirror sucked donkey balls.

0385528752|4.0|This is an excellent book for anyone looking to shape some change into your organization or even your own life. A lot of people have difficulty with change and this book is an excellent resource for both learning about why we are resistant to change and how to make it easier and more successful.<br /><br />Chip & Dan Heath look at the problem of \\"Change\\" and use an excellent analogy of an elephant and its rider to describe the emotional and logical components that fuel our actions and can effect direction change in our life. Sometimes change is hard because we can't see the logical benefit of the change. Often times, however, we are battling the emotional elephant that is resistant to change for deeper reasons that we may not even be aware. When you understand that analogy, you can start looking at problems and the need to change in another way and find solutions to tackling the problem that engage \\"the rider\\" or \\"the elephant\\" or, preferably, both to make the change happen and make it stick.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the authors use colorful real-life stories to illustrate problems and how they have been overcome. They break down techniques directed at directing \\"the rider\\" and motivating \\"the elephant\\" in ways that I thought were thought-provoking, interesting, and very applicable to life and business. Change isn't just about getting other people to do what needs to be done, often it is about getting yourself to do it, too.<br /><br />Finally, they talk about changing the environment to make the change either easier to happen, or more likely to stick. This is more broad-based thinking, but still is illustrative of how we often need to \\"look outside the box\\" at the problems behind the problem that keep our best efforts from succeeding.<br /><br />I'm giving this book 4/5 stars because it's really a great read. The 5th star is taken simply because a lot of these ideas aren't new and if you've done a significant amount of reading in this genre, you've probably read much of this before. But, I give the authors full credit for putting those ideas together with a super-functional analogy that makes it memorable, and using modern references that most Americans will recognize and identify.<br /><br />If you are looking for an interesting book with to try to enter the \\"personal enrichment\\" genre, or are a developing leader in any area of business who wants to do some reading along these lines, this is an excellent place to start.read much of this before.

B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Warner Bros. did an excellent job transferring this film to Blu-ray. a bit grainy but if you adjust the contrast on the t.v. it's not nearly as noticeable as the the DVD format. the disc also comes loaded with tons of extras including a full length picture in picture making of commentary all while you watch the film. they even included the music video Passive by A Perfect Circle, which I not only love the song but am a huge fan of the band, so what more can you ask for? all in all this version of Constantine is definitely worth picking up

B000GIWRIY|4.0|I have to admit, this is not Tull's best album.  Certainly not up there with the classics like &#34;Aqualung&#34;, &#34;Thick As A Brick&#34; and &#34;Stand Up&#34;.  But there is much good here.  The album kicks off with a great title track and then for me, weakens a bit over the next several tracks.  But from &#34;Beside Myself&#34; through the closing &#34;Another Harry's Bar&#34;, this is some of the best material Ian and the gents have EVER recorded.  This release never quite received the credit it deserved.  Great lyrics and Ian's flute playing, along with Martin's guitar work, are superb, especially through the second half of the album.  I absolutely love the play between Martin's guitar and Ian's flute that closes the album on &#34;Another Harry's Bar&#34;.  This one is &#34;Another Ian's Gem&#34;.  Certainly one of their best, after the 3 aforementioned classics.
0805095535|4.0|The Guardian's respected book pages may have panned this memoir in a rather vicious review that may in time become infamous. I found that while I acknowledge many of that critic's issues with the book -- yes, it teeters on the self-indulgent; yes, it meanders -- there's plenty here to interest a reader, and some passages that are downright eloquently beautiful and elegiac.<br /><br />Auster at his best is spot on when noticing small details, such as the moment when, as a small boy, he began to step gradually outside the ambit of his mother (whose death triggers in Auster a wave of devastating anxiety attacks and leads, ultimately, to this memoir). \\"The inner dialogue had begun,\\" he writes, \\"and you had crossed into the domain of self-conscious selfhood.\\" Speaking of self-consciousness, I confess I did find the constant use of \\"you\\" in the place of \\"I\\", the first person singular, an irritant bordering on an affectation. Having lived literally doors away from where Auster did in two separate parts of Brooklyn (albeit a decade or more apart), I rejoiced in his ability to capture the spirit of the place in a few carefully-chosen words, such as \\"the blast of sharp, beautiful smells that assaulted you whenever you walked into\\" D'Amico's, a local shop. He captures in a few elegant sentences just what it's like to meet someone and know that you have found a soulmate.<br /><br />In the hands of a lesser writer, this could be very tedious indeed. It's a stream of consciousness look back at Auster's  life; at the events that led him to the \\"winter of his life\\", and if you don't happen to be interested, you'll find it boring or annoying. There's a long section where he ponders every address he's ever lived at, from a Provencal farmhouse to his current residence in Park Slope. He writes of his wife, of his mother, his ex-wife; his experiences at public school and as a struggling writer in Paris. In case you were hoping for insights into how Auster writes, his philosophy, his approach to his art, be warned: this is not a writer's memoir. (It might be more accurately described as an everyman's memoir.) And yet, a reader familiar with Auster's work will pick out ideas and themes and see how they might be woven into his stories. Moreover, there's a fabulous passage about the process of writing that resonated with me, and hints at what makes Auster the kind of writer he is: \\"In order to do what you do, you need to walk. Walking is what brings the words to you, what allows you to hear the rhythms of the words as you write them in your head. One foot forward, and then the other foot forward, the double drumbeat of your heart. Two eyes, two ears, two arms, two legs, two feet. This, and then that. That, and then this. Writing begins in the body, it is the music of the body, and even if the words have meaning, can sometimes have meaning, the music of the words is where the meanings begin. You sit at your desk in order to write down the words, but in your head you are still walking, always walking, and what you hear is the rhythm of your heart, the beating of your heart ... Writing as a lesser form of dance.\\"<br /><br />If you like Auster's writing style, you'll probably enjoy at least some parts of this. And I suspect that this will have particular resonance for readers over the age of 50, who are grappling with some of the experiences that Auster addresses: the small daily indignities and larger losses that go along with age. Perhaps it's not a book to buy, but one to seek out at the library and see if it annoys you or whether it offers enough moments of vivid descriptive writing to offset the more irksome elements. In either case, you won't be investing a tremendous amount of time or energy -- I devoured this in two evenings -- so why allow the Guardian reviewer to make your decision for you?roach to his art, be warned: this is not a writer's memoir. (It might be more accurately described as an everyman's memoir.) And yet, a reader familiar with Auster's work will pick out ideas and themes and see how they might be woven into his stories. Moreover, there's a fabulous passage about the process of writing that resonated with me, and hints at what makes Auster the kind of writer he is: \\"In order to do what you do, you need to walk. Walking is what brings the words to you, what allows you to hear the rhythms of the words as you write them in your head. One foot forward, and then the other foot forward, the double drumbeat of your heart. Two eyes, two ears, two arms, two legs, two feet. This, and then that. That, and then this. Writing begins in the body, it is the music of the body, and even if the words have meaning, can sometimes have meaning, the music of the words is where the meanings begin. You sit at your desk in order to write down the words, but in your head you are still walking, always walking, and what you hear is the rhythm of your heart, the beating of your heart ... Writing as a lesser form of dance.\\"<br /><br />If you like Auster's writing style, you'll probably enjoy at least some parts of this. And I suspect that this will have particular resonance for readers over the age of 50, who are grappling with some of the experiences that Auster addresses: the small daily indignities and larger losses that go along with age. Perhaps it's not a book to buy, but one to seek out at the library and see if it annoys you or whether it offers enough moments of vivid descriptive writing to offset the more irksome elements. In either case, you won't be investing a tremendous amount of time or energy -- I devoured this in two evenings -- so why allow the Guardian reviewer to make your decision for you?

B004JMZPJG|4.0|This case can accommodate my Canon 60d & 18-135mm, some filters on the side pockets and 2 replacement batteries. For the price I consider the case it quite useful for my needs as I also use a back pack for other accessories. Very handy but the plastic clips from the shoulder strap feels a little bit not strong enough to support case weight. I hope they will resist.
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|This film was unusual, to say the least. Since there is no audio the actors really had to \\"act\\"......and they did. Don't want to see a series of black and white silent films but this one was well done.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app was one of my favorite on the apple market and now finnaly it is on amdroid. This app is great and you really have to get it. Don't listen to the people who say their are bugs in this app. There really isn't and the game is awesome. Unfortunately you run out of missions fast but their is tons of stuff to by like other jetpacks ans gadgets.

B002T3LHG2|5.0|While iTunes tells me this is a country album, it has more in common with the kind of highly creative folky-orchestral soundtracks you'd expect given the members of The Swell Season. Ranging on the touching side--without being sappy, I might add--the album is perfect for a rainy day or as slow background music that offers brilliant orchestration and lyrics. One of the better albums I've heard in the last three years.<br /><br />Oh, and Rachelle, thanks for giving this to me. Can't hear it without thinking of you, and hope you're well wherever you are now.

Discussing it made me want to go back and read it all over again.  I did go home and google it to read about the author and see what other readers were saying about it.

0131480057|5.0|There's a reason this book receives glowing reviews, and it doesn't have much to do with what's in it. It has to do with what's not in it.<br /><br />I am so accustomed to really miserable, overly verbose tech writing by people who are clearly not good writers that finding this book blew me away. In an era of disposable and free blog writing, I forgot how good tech writing can be. We need more writing like this. I bought the paperback and the Kindle edition. First time, ever, that I bought a book twice. When they come out with a new edition, I'll buy that one, too. Another first.<br /><br />Tech book publishers, take note of why this book works:<br /><br />- There aren't equally-weighted discussions about every single option available.<br />- There's not a lot of BS filler.<br />- There's historical context which aids in memorization. Stories teach.<br />- There's a lot of \\"do this, here's why\\" aka \\"best practices\\".<br />- There aren't pages and pages of useless code that nobody cares about.<br />- There are no gimmicks (free CD/DVDs and the like) attached to the book.<br />- The writing style assumes you are busy and treats your time as valuable.<br /><br />In this book is practical wisdom and tested/tried techniques to get you started on most things you will do as an admin. The authors know you have Google, and they don't kill you wasting your time. They give you a description of the technology, the most appropriate way(s) to handle it (with syntax), how to think about it, and how it differs (if it differs) between versions of Linux/UNIX.

B0030Y11XS|4.0|Michael Moore finds the junction between money and justice, and the people who are squeezed in it, in this film. As with his other works, Moore sets out with a thesis and then goes to the entities and institutions where you'd think he'd be able to prove or disprove it. He finds his answer not in those entities, but in the people whose lives are overlooked and bruised by their policies.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book is a look at the modern presidency and former Presidents in the post-World War II era. It starts out with Truman in office and explores how Herbert Hoover chose to assist Truman with his various duties as president. From then on, the book continues to explore the various relationships between the Presidents. Some examples include how Truman and Eisenhower were once friends only to become bitter enemies, but eventually reconciled. How Ford and Carter, who opposed each other in the election in 1976, eventually became friends when they realized how much they had in common, such as a mutual dislike of Reagan.<br /><br />The personalities are not the only thing covered in this book but several important events as well. For example, how John F. Kennedy sought Eisenhower's advice during the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br /><br />I found this to be a very interesting look at the relationships between Presidents. I would recommend this to those interested in U.S. Presidents.
B0085G0DH6|5.0|If you liked \\"Nude Ants,\\" don't hesitate to get this.  The band plays beautifully, and there's such great interplay.  Easily one of the best releases of the year.
0345803485|1.0|This is a really, really awful book.  I realize there are plenty of other great reviews on here saying exactly the same thing, and I have to tell you that I read them with a sigh of relief.  What exactly is the appeal of this book?  The bad, 5th grade level writing?  The obnoxious, unlikable characters?  The creepy stalking and emotional abuse from Our Hero?  Or maybe it's those sex scenes.  Spoiler Alert:<br />He introduces her to his penis.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert over.  For any of you who share my opinion and want to see some snark, I've been recapping these books on my blog.  I'm not the only one.  There are several other bloggers out there that are really hilarious.  I've linked to a few.  I think humor is one of the few defenses against this kind of nonsense.<br /><br />In case any fans have questions, I'll go ahead and answer some of them right now.  Yes, I read the book.  No, I'm not writing this negative review out of sour grapes.  I'm writing it because it really does suck.  Yes, I can write.  No, I haven't had anything published. But all you have to be to write a review is a reader.  That's it. I came, I saw, I read, I facepalmed.  If you'd like to see my recaps, my blog is at aliceatwonderland.wordpress.com.  I can say that at least it's better reading than this book.  So are many of the reviews here.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|The game is fun but it hangs my phone every time it tries to connect to the Amazon Appstore, such as to buy in-app purchases or verifying licenses.  It makes it to frustrating to try and play.
B008M34INW|4.0|I love to watch Mel Gibson in movies. He has such a presence on the screen.<br /><br />The one thought that kept coming to mind when watching this is that it could be the later day sequel to his movie \\"Payback\\". Same kind of action, pain, killing, and throughout it all, the voice of Mel providing narration in such a mater of fact way that is humorous.<br /><br />The movie is a bit of a stretch to believe, but hey, its Hollywood so you enjoy the fantasy and go with it.<br /><br />Its very much an action movie that takes place near the border and then in a Mexican prison. This prison is run by some Mexican mob and the idea that men and women can co-exist in the same prison is really out there, but....its Hollywood.<br /><br />It isn't a chick flick....to be sure. My wife quit halfway through but I soldiered on and watched the rest of it.<br /><br />This is a guy's film. Mel might have been a looker back in the day, but gravity and fame have eroded his beauty and now he is a very rugged looking guy who is very likeable and believable in any movie.<br /><br />Yea I know he has had his troubles, but if I can watch some brain dead liberal like Sean Penn I can sure watch Mel Gibson.<br /><br />Keep on making'em Mel! You are such a great actor! Move to Shreveport and make Indy films all you want.

1442419814|4.0|I am a huge fan of dystopian novels, and \\"Uglies,\\" the first in a series of four, did not disappoint.  Sure, I wanted to reach out and slap the protagonist a few times, but I thought it was fascinating to watch her reactions over the course of the book.  I was also intrigued by some of the concepts and plot points that were introduced later in the book, and I am really looking forward to finding out how it all ties together in subsequent books.  I've already picked up \\"Pretties\\" and can't wait to read it!

B000I186FW|5.0|Movie was amazing...and a wake up call.  Depicted quite well how the media reports the official story of events rather than investigating events....among other things
B000FCKGPC|1.0|This is a prime example of lazy writing and zero editing. I don't mean grammar editing - I mean, \\"Dude, don't change the rules. And spend pages describing inane, irrelevant places and details. And introduce new characters that nobody cares about, while leaving good characters without a mention. Don't do that. Your audience might follow you down these silly sidetracks, but they won't be happy about it.\\"  This series looks like it will become another Wheel of Time - on and on and on and on  . . .

B001GCUO5M|5.0|Scorcese movies are distinguished by an almost nonstop placement of contemporary pop music as background to the action in the film. Such use of pop music is understandable. Scorcese was at Woodstock and is credited with editing the documentary film. In the past, Scorcese's use of contemporary pop music has had mixed results. Much of the time it seems that Scorcese is placing these standard pop tunes in the movies for no apparent reason. After all, what relation does \\"I ain't Superstitious\\" have to gangsters in Las Vegas? Not much. The background music should relate to the action in the movie.<br /><br />The most effective element in Shutter Island, on the other hand, is the choice of music. It matches the ethereal other-worldly atmosphere of the penal hospital to a tee. In this movie the music was chosen by Robbie Robertson of the Band. It is primarily Twentieth Century music of the John Cage type. The music is brilliantly and effectively chosen and used in the film.<br /><br />Perspective viewers are able to read the other reviews for this movie to get an idea of what to expect this brilliant movie.

I am a word for word reader and I stayed up until 4:00 on a Friday night because I couldn't put down 50 Shades of Grey and then began reading Darker straight away.

B004EPYZPS|3.0|Super 8(released June/11)gives us the one two punch of Steven Spielberg and Hollywood's flavour of the moment,J.J.Abrams.The hype would certainly lead one to believe this is an instant classic,a truly unforgettable cinematic experience,a movie you will see again and again,et al.Well,if you've been around movies along as I have,the hype becomes just that,alot of words/hot air to inflate something up,that may or may not have a pay day in the end.And the hype today is pretty much the same stuff they've been dishing out since the 20s.Does Super 8 have a long half life?Let's see.<br />The plot gives us a group of kids who love to make movies.Each character has their own raison d'etre,as Spielberg and company make each a stand out in their own right,translation:makes them like us ordinary folks.One is a wanna be movie director with a weight problem,one loves to play with matches and explosives,one likes to act but can't,one has a cop for a father and whose mother just passed away,and into this mix is thrown a young girl whose father doesn't get along with the aforesaid cop.<br />One evening finds the group out at a railroad station filming.A train approaches which will make a fine backdrop for their scene,but something startling will happen.One of them notices a pick up come onto the tracks ahead of the train and deliberately run into it.This causes the train to derail,but the train cars start flying through the air like footballs.By now they have abandoned their camera which has fallen sideways onto the platform but continues to film.In the aftermath they look around at the devastation not believing what just happened,let alone the fact they are all still alive.Suddenly the military approach-ith and the kids ski-doo.<br />The kids have all agreed not to discuss their experience,as the military has the crash scene sewn up.Slowly but surely strange things are a-happening.Dogs,people and equipment are disappearing in the town at an alarming rate,with no apparent explanation.One evening the girl of the group gets snatched up and taken away by a large creature.The boys stumble onto some notes a school professor had accrued over a long period of time,which has a direct bearing on what is happening now.The military interrupts their gathering and takes them all by bus back for interrogation.Along the way the creature attacks and tips the bus over.It kills the military men,but the kids escape.<br /><br />In the meantime the military has set a deliberate fire which threatens to engulf the entire town.They evacuate its citizens so they can go on the hunt and recapture this alien.It seems they captured it and its' spaceship years before,but the alien has wanted to go home ever since,and now that it is free this is what it intends to do.The remainders of the group drive back to town in an attempt at rescuing the girl,who has been taken down to an underground cavern.Underground,they indeed find the girl and return to the surface.They are just in time to witness the water tower turn into a giant magnet,drawing objects big and small onto it.The creature goes inside the tower,which immediately converts into an alien craft and away he/she/it goes.<br />Does this film live up to its 'classic' hype?.....not by a million light years.I found this film to be quite a boring time,frankly.The only thing classic about this film are the Spielberg touches,such as the attention to detail in the characterizations I mentioned earlier,getting the experiences of youth/young love,etc.from their perspective,feeling the ultimate empathy for the alien,one man,er boy,standing bravely up to and connecting with said alien,and finally no Spielberg picture would be complete without a resolution of the parent/child conflict at the beginning of the film,at the end,coupled with a tender reunion to enhance it all.Ahhhh.Trouble is,by the time this film wraps up I couldn't have cared less who made up with who or that the creature made it safely away,or any of the touchy feely moments Spielberg tried to engender.And speaking of the wrap up,I was actually surprised the ending,WAS the ending.I was expecting more footage of...I don't know what....anything,I guess.The film also takes its sweet time meandering its way through its somewhat cumbersome plot,introducing us all to its characters and locations which must engender within us that\\"Oh yeah,I remember that time\\",or the old chestnut\\"Hey Bob,I used to have a house and car just like that\\".Yep,that's a Spielberg moment,if ever there was one.Except,this is NOT E.T.,and I mean that in the sense that it doesn't come anywhere close to the quality of that film.And you know while we're on the subject and have Mr Spielberg's attention(he always reads my reviews!),I have just about had it with the portrayal of kids of that age who would NEVER in a million years have talked to each other,let alone their parents,in the fashion they do,without dying a million deaths.He can get the clothes right,the music down pretty good but the precociousness that most of his young characters exhibit,has just got to go,OK Steven?<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in its w/s format.There is commentary and two featurettes on the making of the film.<br />All in all a HUGE disappointment.I try not to let the hype into my reviews and/or influence me in any way.In fact I find the more I know,the more skeptical I am about what is to come.I get to a point and become a Missourian...\\"Show Me\\".The hype couldn't save this stinker.The pace and the meandering script are way off the beam and all the tricks Spielberg can muster cannot even save the day here.It's another War of the Worlds(2005).Give it a pass.2 1/2-3 stars.ents

0783114893|4.0|Another cinematographic or thematic analysis isn't necessary at this point on this site, although I find interesting the interpretation that the villain is possibly an alternate personality in the protagonist's tormented psyche. In that respect, it would be similar to Fight Club, and the next time I watch it it'll be with that in mind. I'd also rank it ahead of the remake.<br /><br />The acting is mostly solid, but Rutger Hauer's performance really stands out. As the movie wore on, the John Ryder (Hauer) character reminded me more and more of Heath Ledger's Joker. It's' a chilling, enigmatic tour de force delivery from someone whom some viewers might not be familiar with. He is defiant, mysterious, fearless, twisted and deadly. Saying any more than that could lead to spoilers.<br /><br />If you're a fan of villains, Hauer gives you one for the ages, like he did in Blade Runner. This maniac is right up there with the likes of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), Hannibal Lecter (A. Hopkins), Anton Chiguhr (Javier Baldem), and of course The Joker (Heath Ledger).
1476712042|5.0|Beautiful Disaster. I'll repeat it again for those who aren't familiar with the novel. Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire!  This book was my all-time favorite this summer. I'll start by saying it was a complete obsession for me. In fact, as far as ratings go it was a 5. Yes, that's how much I loved it.<br /><br />It's not very often, we readers find a male character that we adore or better yet cleave to. Travis Maddox is that character. He's perfectly flawed and extremely likable. No wonder all the chicks are whipping off their panties for him. All except for Abby Abernathy. She's a reformed good girl and as much as she's attracted to the elusive bad boy, she won't succumb to his charm. Putting these two together made for some spectacular reading. Abby & Travis are the quintessential disaster couple, and Beautiful Disaster is about their wild roller-coaster relationship, which began as a friendship and ends up with love.<br /><br />I adored this book, and I can't rave about it enough.  Move over Fifty Shades and make way for Beautiful Disaster.  And for those of you that don't know,  Jamie McGuire has just finalized Walking Disaster which is Beautiful Disaster told from Travis's perspective.  OH MY GOD!!!  I can't wait to read that one.  God, I hope she writes a story for each of the brothers.  Love you Jamie McGuire.  You rock!

1476712042|5.0|A great love story! I read it in one day and I feel lost without it! I hope they can make this into a movie!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|a very good game that I love I had it for two days then I finished it it will sometimes not work but its still a good game I think they should make jet back joyride two or update it.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Wunderlist is a great app for a todo/task manager. It's not overwhelmed with toolbars or bloated with features and options that would make a simple task manager seem overbearing. I've not had any problems with it on the Mac or Kindle Fire, the app sync's and works well between the two devices.<br /><br />If you are looking for a stable, and decent app for todo lists, tasks and that sort without a bunch of toolbars or options to swim through, just something simple and clean for the job, then Wunderlist is worth looking at. Not to mention it's free!
B000IDGDPA|2.0|I don't generally write movie reviews, but this one was so bad I couldn't help myself.  The characters seemed one-dimensional, and none of them were believable.  Dialogue was lacking and artificial. All the principal actors (especially Helen Hunt)--who were such great artists in other movies--really flopped in this one.  Maybe they had a hard time believing the horrible dialogue coming out of their mouths.  The only redeeming quality of this moving is its setting in the Amalfi Coast.
B004I744AS|5.0|Excellent app. Very easy to use. I recommend this because you can navigate. this app with out any effort. the first time you try.

B000H7JD4A|3.0|Ehh, seems like one big long song all joined up.  I got this in 2006 when it came out, ripping it to MP3 now and this just like Dance Of Death all sounds for the most part like one song or at least one formula that has gotten stale.  I thought Brave New World was impressive, but something needed to change up following that one to keep it fresh.  I don't think Dance did enough and neither did A Matter Of Life And Death.  Let's get back to some more manageable song lengths maybe and get those songs to at least sound way more different from each other than they have been in recent times.  Can we keep it to just one epic 7+ minute song next time?  Drop the needle almost anywhere on this platter and it takes a while to figure out what songs is playing you may be playing something off of Dance of Death... hahahahah.  3 stars.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is very much like \\"Where's my water\\".  My kids really enjoy both games, enjoy figuring out the challenges.  The games are well done...  If you already have \\"Where's my water\\" you might find \\"Where's my Perry\\" repetitive...  Or you might be delighted to have more of the same, except with Perry.  Using on Kindle Fire, works beautifully.

0671449028|1.0|I bought this book when my son was 12 months old thinking he would enjoy it as he has liked similar books by this author. Unfortunately he hates this book. I think the storyline is a bit confusing and almost too singsongy. Everytime I get the book out he tells me, \\"no, no no!\\" I wouldn't really recommend this one.

0439023483|5.0|Its a good as every one says and way better than the movie. Read the books before watching the movies.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I love this movie.  I read the books and saw it in the theater twice so I was eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD.  I pre-ordered and received my first DVD right away.  I popped the DVD in just minutes after it was delivered. Once I began watching I realized that it completely skipped scene 15.  So I returned it and received my replacement DVD the very next day.  I decided to watch this one as well just to make sure it was good.  It started off okay but only the first couple of minutes of scene 14 played then it skiped to scene 15.  After that, I did not watch any further.  Unsure if I'll try another replacement or just request a refund.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I believe I got this as Amazon's free app of the day one time. It has been a wonderful addition to my phone! I am currently using it to fill-in the answers on my take-home study guide as I read for school. It can read .doc, .docx, .rtf, and .txt files, .pdf, and perhaps spreadsheet files too. I've only used it for MS Word files and Pdf's from both the Internet and my office. Anyway, great app!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book because my daughters had downloaded to our Kindle account.  Seriously the worst work of fiction I have read since cheap romance novels in middle school.  A middle school kid struggling in writing could do a better job of writing (if they had knowledge of weird sex practices).  It was insulting it was so bad and I was rolling my eyes at all the REALLY bad cliches that are used over and over and over.  I only finished it because people kept telling me that the STORY was compelling.  Not so.  Do not WASTE YOUR TIME!!  A travesty that someone with so little talent is making money on this when there are so many gifted writers who struggle to make a living.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I thought this movie was great when I first watched it, but that was only because I was hooked on the action scenes. So, allow me to delineate what my second thoughts were when I came back and watched it a second time with a clearer head, by quoting the show Community.<br /><br />Abed: It's the movie \\"Sucker Punch\\" on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Pierce: That's the meaning of Christmas?<br /><br />Abed: No, it's a metaphor. It represents a lack of payoff.
0345803485|1.0|I don't even know how to put into words how badbadbad this book is.How did something like this get published?

B0082LUEW8|5.0|After two mediocre albums Hell Yeah has finally delivered.  This is a straight forward in you face metal album that sounds like a combination of Mudvayne and Pantera.  Gone is the southern metal influences that dominated the first two albums, instead Band of Brothers is heavy metal greatness.  The album starts out with War in Me a song that punches you in the face with classic Chad Gray screams mixed with heavy guitar.  The album continues the assault with every song until the very end never letting up.  Between you and nowhere, the only slower song on the album rocks just as hard as the rest of the album and features great vocal work from chad.  I'm a big fan of Mudvayne and was let down with the first two releases from Hell Yeah but Band of Brothers makes up for them.  The lyrics, while sometimes questionable are very catchy.  Hell Yeah has never been a band known for having deep meaningful lyrics.  Hell Yeah's music has always been about drinking and smoking weed and this album is no different.  Tracks to check out include War in Me, Bnd of Brothers, Drink, Drank, Drunk, Bigger God, and what it takes to be me.  I have drink, drank drunk Band of Brothers and i love every second of it.
B00828JCI8|5.0|It's taken me a while but I've become a fan of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\", the quirky story of four \\"geeks\\" and their wannabe actress/waitress ditzy blonde neighbor.  These are well written and well casted - and sometimes just laugh out loud funny.  Get to know Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Raj and Penny...you'll be glad you did.  Because of the erratic nature of reruns on TV, I decided to take the plunge and buy Season One and Season Two to start watching from the beginning.  Well worth the money, there are so many episodes in each collection.  I've got a feeling they will be watched over and over again.  Good fun, good value.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|How on earth is this a best seller?  The writing style is horrific, the characters weak and the abuse is sickening.  Would this relationship have happened if Christian was poor and unattractive?  Do not waste your time on this.
0760748683|5.0|What sets this work apart from many others is that the story is so well focused that one does not lose track of any of the main characters.  Really, there is no need for sequels because all the loose ends are tied up.  For that reason, Austen has given us a remarkable masterpiece.<br /><br />I will not go into the plot, you need to read it, but just know that this book is at one time a fanciful and a serious examination of the lives of women in the neoclassical era.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it! Spent the week at the beach and couldn't put the last book down. Where is #4? But how are they going to make this a movie? Steamy!
0446310492|4.0|After over 2000 other reviews there is probably little new that I can add, except to say this book is one of the great thought experiments of modern American fiction.  The entire process is set to show the barbarity of the Jim Crow system, and it succeeds.  All students in school should be made to read it.<br /><br />The writing of the novel is brought into further relief by the acting of Gregory Peck in the movie of the same title.<br /><br />The reason for the four star rating instead of five is the characters of Aunt Alexandra and Miss Maudie.  To me they blend together too much.  But the book does bring out varied levels of the human condition.  I first read the book in the eighth grade.  I now teach it to freshmen in high school.  A great piece of fiction.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Game is fun and easy in the first 30 or 40 levels. HOWEVER be warned. Game is designed to have increasingly destructive incidents that over time overtake production output of coin resources. Player in upper levels (I was about level 96 when I removed the game) is forced into a position where daily profits were eaten up by the increasing costs of disasters. At that point the player must decide whether to spend REAL MONEY to buy in-game items that produce more coin or to watch as their stockpile of coins slowly gets eaten away. Some quests can only be fulfilled by purchasing in-game items available only with in-game dollars bought with real life money. I refuse to pay real life money for virtual goods in an app. If I'm going to invest in a game, it will be a major mmorpg that I can truly play with friends as a group, not a &lt;snicker> app.  Missing my DOS version of Oregon Trail that had no strings attached.
B005HEU7LG|5.0|This episode is very deep within the context of the effects of war. First, we have the premise of a rogue captain who is still fighting this war on his own, even though a treaty had been signed between the Federation and the Cardassians. Picard and ship are sent out to track this rogue captain and stop him. There is an uneasy peace among the Cardassians and the Federation that seems to be from the fact that the war had only been recently ended. However, Picard faces several conundrums. First, should he give up transponder codes to a former enemy that will open a Federation ship to attack, in the interest of saving the lives of people who were once enemies? Next, Picard has to decide whether Captain Maxwell's suspicion of the Cardassians is enough to risk jeopardizing a peace treaty. Of course we see Picard's burden grow heavy with these decisions.<br /><br />Still, the more human element to this story comes with Captain Maxwell and Chief O'Brien. Both served together, and suffered much emotional pain as a result of the war with the Cardassians. However, O'Brien is seen making strides to heal that pain in the episode, but Maxwell's pain is seen as finally having driven him off the edge, explaining his actions of destroying a few ships. Still, Picard does what he must, and is still able to show his support for Maxwell, issuing a stern warning to the Cardassian representative that \\"We'll be watching\\".<br /><br />This episode in general has a darker tone, with much pain evident on Maxwell, O'Brien, a Cardassian, and even Picard. With themes relevant to our current state of the world, this is a must see.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Great show! Everything that Joss does is amazing! Also, you can't go wrong with Nathan Fillion... did I spell his name right? Anyway, watch it now!

B000244FDW|5.0|I have known and loved this version of P & P since I first saw it on masterpiece Theatre years ago.  I bought the VHS version and watched it countless times until I wore out the tape, which is why i bought the DVD version.<br />This is the mosy faithful video or movie adaptation of a book that I know, and the best show I have ever seen on TV.  The casting and performances are superb; just Mr. Collins alone is worth the price.  I could go on and on, but what more can I say?
B005FISBTO|3.0|I believe Dexter has about run it's course.  I am finding the season interesting but it is not as fresh anymore.  I am interested enough to watch but probably will not buy a 7th season if that comes out.

B002M2T1UO|4.0|I cannot improve on the other reviews.  This is a good series.  The removal of the star is due to the horrible packaging.  It is like playing operation getting one of the disks out of the \\"book\\".  The disks are covered by a wrapper so they will not be scratched, but I can see that not working well forever.  I wish they would have not have jammed those disks in between cardboard but I will get my extraction kit out for the removal and reinsertion of disks.  It is worth the effort.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it.  Loved it. Loved it.  The back and forth nature of the writing between the chapters keeps you interested and guessing.  I have recommended it to anyone who asks me what book I think they should download next.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a great read.  The characters were well developed.  I found myself empathizing with each of the title characters at one point or another.  And it is always interesting when the pupil becomes the teacher.  And who doesn't like a courtroom drama?
0375507256|5.0|I first read David Mitchell's 2004 novel Cloud Atlas several years ago, and absolutely loved it.  I'd been considering re-reading it for a while, and with the release of the film adaptation coming up in a couple months, now seemed like the perfect time.  If anything, I enjoyed it even more the second time through, given the unique structure of the novel and Mitchell's complex and interwoven thematic threads.<br /><br />To start with, let me address the structure of the novel. Cloud Atlas features six interconnected stories.  It's not that simple, though.  The first five of the stories are left at a cliffhanger, and after the sixth story you revisit the stories in reverse order, returning to end with the first story.  The characters in each story encounter one or more of the others through books, letters, film, or campfire tales, but don't directly interact.  It's a very compelling format, and Mitchell is able to leave you eager to find out what happened in the last story while at the same time pulling you into the next.<br /><br />Mitchell does an amazing job of writing in a variety of different styles and genres so effectively that the stories seem more likely to have come from six different authors.  As a particular fan of some of the genres he visits, I was very impressed with those and would love to see more from him just in those genres.  At the same time, the other stories were still very well done and I enjoyed them as well.<br /><br />Now, for the stories themselves.  The first is \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,\\" in which an American chronicles his voyage home through the Pacific Islands in 1850.  This story strongly reminded me of Robert Louis Stevenson, which was a very good thing, since I'm a huge Stevenson fan.  \\"Letters from Zedelghem\\" follows, and is the story of Robert Frobisher, a scamp of a composer in the 1930's, against the backdrop of interwar Europe.  The third story is \\"Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery\\" and is a pulp crime drama set in 1970's California.<br /><br />The second half of the stories are from the current day and into the future.  \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\" tells of a early 21st century senior citizen on the run who ends up trapped in a nursing home, and is pretty much contemporary fiction.  The next tale is \\"An Orison of Sonmi~451\\" and is the story of a rebellious cloned fast food worker in a near-future corporate dystopia Korea, and reminds me a great deal of excellent dystopian science fiction novels such as George Orwell's 1984 and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale.  The final tale we arrive at before heading back down the chain is \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After\\" and is, as one might see coming as a natural follow-up to a dystopian science fiction story, a post-apocalyptic science fiction story, set on Hawaii among some of the last \\"civilized\\" humans and told by Zachry around the campfire in his old age.<br /><br />My favorite sections were the Ewing, Sonmi~451, and Zachry stories.  This is largely because these are more in the style of my usual reading, being as I am a big Stevenson and science fiction fan.  But I still greatly enjoyed the other three stories and found them to be very well done.<br /><br />Mitchell weaves a variety of themes into the novel, some of which are stronger in some sections, some in others.  Freedom, slavery, liberation, reincarnation, karma, civilization, and savagery come through the tale very strongly.  He also weaves the islands of the Pacific into story in several interesting ways.  I'm glad I read the novel a second time, because in addition to the stories referencing the ones before, there are also strong connections going forward that are easy to miss your first read through, but bring things together even more tightly on another read.<br /><br />Mitchell does an amazing job of writing so well in so many different styles and in such a complex format.  That alone is intriguing, but what really makes Cloud Atlas suchan amazing novel is that he makes you care about each and every one of our protagonists.  Their struggles may be different in some ways, but they all are really a part of the same eternal conflict, and each has to navigate it in their own way. Cloud Atlas is without a doubt one of my favorite novels, and I can see myself taking that journey with Adam, Robert, Luisa, Timothy, Sonmi~451, and Zachry many more times.  I cannot recommend this novel more highly.an amazing novel is that he makes you care about each and every one of our protagonists.

This book was absolutely invaluable.  Knowing what a stoke victim FEELS was so informative that we have checked with each other before going in to visit ANY patient to make sure our attitudes and energy were excellent as anything else scares them.  I buy this book for gifts to those who have family or friends who are suffering from stroke.  The education alone is stupendous.

B005LB1MY6|5.0|For my money, this is Justice's best album. Because 'cross' was experimental in many respects, critics love that album, but while that album is good, some of it's songs are necessarily weird. Audio, Video, Disco is melodic, loud, thumping, music. There are elements of daft punk in here along with an homage to some old rock bands (I detect a bit of Yes for example). The melodies are up-lifiting. This is sunshine and summertime music. Something you need to have cranked with the top down on your convertible.<br /><br />I took this CD and 'cross' on a trek in August from Munich to Neuschwanstein (along with some other CD's). This album was an amazing soundtrack for the trip. I had to listen to it twice and then took it again as one of the CD's for a trek from Munich to Italy. Again it was my favorite of the pack. If you are a fan of melody in music, you will like this album.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I haven't read a romance novel in a very long time. I decided to give this one a try based on all the hype it received.  I don't regret it.  The book so was good... and not just because of the love scenes. I think the draw for this book is that you fall in love with the characters.  James says she's not a good writer, but she's very good a telling a story from 1st person without completely isolating the other characters. You really care about the characters. I ended up reading all three 3 books in less than a month. It would have been sooner than that if life didn't get in the way (work, friendships, and other responsibilities. LOL). I was a little sad after I ran out of books to read. She needs to hurry up and write another one. Happy Reading!!

Way inappropriate for kids, of course, and tons of the humor would be lost on anyone without a sense of recent history in the Middle East, but nothing grossly offensive or shocking. Well, except one running gag, but I don't want to spoil it. I'll just say Plan B ran out of steam pretty quick for me.
0439023521|5.0|I LOVE this book.  I have read it at least three times since getting it and every time, it's just as good and I still can't put it down.  I have recommended it to all of my friends and they love it too.  It keeps you interested and angry and happy and sad all at the same time.  If you're being hesitant about buying this book, don't be.  It is absolutely my favorite book of all time, and I can almost guarantee it will be yours too.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|my favorite part about this app is the cute bubbling battery. plus I can change the color I want my battery to be. and this is super helpful when you want to know when to take your charger out. very helpful! and I barely ever right a good review so this means something.
078617465X|5.0|Very happy with my purchase, arrived promptly, and in top condition. I am enjoying the reader, he has a good grip on the accents.  I have had this book for some time, but the size and weight of it make me hesitate to read it.  I use audio books frequently, as I am on the road a lot.

B005DOKL3E|2.0|This is not a \\"cover\\" that holds the kindle while you're reading it, though many of the other kindle cases are, and that's what I thought I was seeing in the picture.  The zipper only goes around 2 sides and does not unzip fully to be a holder from which you can hold the kindle and read.  You remove the kindle from the case and read it as a stand alone.  This defeats the purpose of a case, in my opinion; you're most likely to drop/scratch the kindle while you're reading it, not in your bag.  Not happy to receive the product and have to send it back...
B0026RHR6K|5.0|I watched the series on Netflix and wanted to have a high res version to re-watch it this summer. What a great set - with lots of extras and extended episodes. Also I love the Cylon action figure the box came with. He's on my desk now... silently watching me....
B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is my first GPS/Heart Rate Monitor so I don't have much to compare with. However, it works very well and the Garmin website is easy to use and does a great job tracking your progress.  The bezel is kind of a pain as it doesn't actually twist, but simply detects your finger pressure. This leads to all kinds of accidental selections. I use mine for both running and cycling. While it has modes for each, it doesn't easy switch modes mid-work out (i.e. triathlong training).  All in all its a good watch and I'm glad I purchased it.

1476712042|1.0|I heard a lot of good things about this book, but I must admit that I did not feel the same joy over reading it that others did.  This book followed the construct of many romances; a troubled boy with a tough exterior and a quiet girl with hidden depths who vows not be be taken in by the troubled boys charm.  It's a popular story line for a reason, and I certainly don't fault this book for having it because I have found it fun to read, just not in this context.  I enjoyed Abby's friend America and her loyalty, but Abby's supposedly shady past was set up so clumsily that when you actually find out what it is, it's extremely anti-climactic.  Throw in a completely unbelievable trip to Vegas and the whole central part of the book takes a bizarre turn that reminded me of that \\"jump the shark\\" moment that every TV show has.  Despite that, there was a certain addictive element to this book<br /><br />Despite the plot holes and inconsistent characters, I actually would have been ok with this book if not for one thing:  Travis.  Ladies, this is not the guy you want.  I was appalled at how obviously mentally unstable and abusive Travis was.  Yes, abusive.  If my best friend dated someone that acted like Travis, I would have called the police.  His behavior in this book went way beyond alpha male.  By all accounts, he should have spent most of his time at the free clinic getting penicillin shots rather than trying to strong-arm Abby into loving him.  He is violent, sexually irresponsible, short tempered and clingy.  When the guy you are dating physically assaults someone for talking to you it's not romance, it's criminal behavior.  It's psychotic behavior.  I could not get past  my horror over Travis and I am so disturbed by how many readers are going crazy over him.  Abby was a strong character who had been through a lot and it did not make sense that she would allow her boyfriend to treat her that way.<br /><br />Obviously, this was not the book for me.  I know I will be in the minority with this rating and I know that everyone has different standards for their male romantic leads, but to me, this was borderline irresponsible for a book that's being marketed to young women.  I just couldn't get past what I viewed as an abusive relationship.the minority with this rating and I know that everyone has different standards for their male romantic leads, but to me, this was borderline irresponsible for a book that's being marketed to young women.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I found myself bored to death half way through this book. Repetitive phrases had me ripping my hair out. Empty, meaningless paragraphs. This was the first time I left a book unfinished and actually wanted a refund. I searched on google instead for spoilers and after reading them, I was glad that I did not spend another minute reading into the rest of the series. I'm really, really sorry if I had offended any fans in anyway. This is simply my opinion, my own preference. This book is just not for me. I will never, ever recommend it to anyone who wants something intellectual, imaginative or useful.
0062124293|5.0|Being a man, I can not imagine how it can be like to be a woman, so when I saw this title, How to be a Woman by Caitlin Moran it tickled me.<br />I was not familiar with Moran but across the pond in her native England, she is quite a star on this rise. This book has shot up the best sellers list there but has just been released in the US.<br />She seems like a Chelsea Handler lite type of woman but from the perspective of a mother of two and noted feminist. The journey begins in her thirteenth year as she vows to change the course of her life, what happens later is a full blown adventure into self discovery.<br />No stone is left unturned as she describes discovering her sexuality with a crush on Chevy Chase, to the women issues that men can never understand.  For a young woman she has had quite an adventurous life from partying with her idol Lady Gaga to not really knowing the true nature of birth until her mid-wife had to explain where the baby actually ventured out.<br />Funny  and witty, it proves that regardless of where you are, girls just want to have fun, How To Be A Woman by Caitlin Moran captures the personal journey of one truly exceptional woman.<br />Moran spells out many life's lessons but this one is one that we should all remind each other daily, \\"Because the real problem here is that we're all dying. All of us.  Every day the cells weaken and the fibers stretch and the heart gets closer to its last beat. The real cost of living is dying, and we've spending days like millionaires; a week here, a month there, casually spunked until all you have left are the two pennies on your eyes.\\"  In the end, you will be reaffirmed that life is for the living and you only get to go thru it once, so why not LIVE!
B008AWBQGW|1.0|The disgrace that Johnny and Gary have brought to this once great band is immensiable. Rossington wrote a few good tunes, and he took part in the co-writing of a few others, but he was not the driving force behind the band. He and Ronnie's brother however are the reason this band is still together. Negating a contract which said they would end the band once three original members were no longer in it, they have now hijacked the name and turned this band into what Nickelback would sound like if they recorded in Nashville or if Big & Rich recorded in British Columbia...If you didn't get the joke, they would sound like each other. There is not a shred of originality or an ounce of care for the legacy left behind by the real Lynyrd Skynyrd. This album is chock full of cliched Nickelback lyrics and riffs. Instead of carrying on the tradition of great outlaw music that the original band wrote that influenced generations to come, they have let the airwaves of clear channel, corporate radio influence them. There is nothing outlaw about that. They have just stolen the name of a great band, because they know the music they make wouldn't sell any other way. These guys don't care about the legacy or the fans...They just care about themselves. Go listen to Artimus Pyle's album 'Artimus Venomus' and get his take of this band calling themselves Skynyrd.

B004LROMX4|5.0|Finally a show I can get in to!  This is the first show I've liked since Lost.  The special effects aren't great, and the actresses are a bit corny, but I love the plot and it leaves me on the edge of my seat. I can't stand a show that is basically the same story every week with a new antagonist..those are the worst, and unfortunatley all over tv. This show has a very complex plot and I have the feeling we won't know the full spectrum of this show until the shows finale, whenever that may be.
B006VREHRS|5.0|When Boardwalk Empire first aired, I viewed the pilot, and could not make it through the first 1/2 hour. In part, I did not find the charcter's and actor's believable in their current roles. I was too accustom to seeing them playing other roles, and could not separate the two. I'm a big Soprano's and Son's of Anarchy fan. Huge fan! I've watched and purchased all three(3) series! I can recite the dialogue in advance to the scene. A lot obsessive, I realize, but non-the-less, addicted to Boardwalk Empire. The Casting Agent is genious! The pairing of Actor's to their respective roles, are fantastic! Steve Buscemi, as Nucky Thompson, is brilliant and so versatile, he takes on and own the role completely! Kelly MacDonald, as Margarot, is adorable! The remaining cast of young and up-and-coming actor's are tremendous! It was not until the second go around, that I became completely engrossed (hooked) into this incredible series! Hats off to you, Terrence Winter, and your brilliant staff of ever-so-creative Writer's and Director's! Can't wait for Season 3 to start. Watch NOW, catch up on Season's 1 & 2, and fasten your seat belt for Season 3! You'll be sucked in! COMPLETELY!
B006M3JVD6|5.0|A great book written by an inspirational woman who not only has an amazing story, but is able to write about it so openly.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|I found no quality control problems as described by some other reviewers. So far I have watched all of the first two seasons, and every episode played just fine. I also like the enhancements in the video; in my opinion they look good and don't interfere with the plots or feeling of the originals. (of course, at the beginning of every episode you get to choose the original or enhanced version)<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the documentation is poor. The disks are only labeled 1, 2, 3, etc. To see which episodes are on them, you have to read the inside of the box (not even a separate card). There was not enough room inside the boxes for the first two seasons, so the last few disks were a mystery until I played them.<br /><br />One bonus is on the disk with \\"Trouble with Tribbles.\\" That disk also has the Deep Space Nine sequel of \\"Trials and Tribbilations\\", in Blu-Ray. Very nice.<br /><br />To the good, the episodes are in the correct order.<br /><br />There is a difference between season 1 and the other two. I do not have an expensive Blu-Ray player, and it has trouble with Java programming. The first season was great, I could hit the STOP button, and PLAY would resume where I had stopped it. Seasons 2 and 3 seem to depend on Java, and hitting the STOP button returns me to the beginning of the disk, so I then have to work my way through the FBI warnings, the previews, and then work my way back to the part of the episode I had been watching. It's a shame CBS decided to make this change to seasons 2 and 3 because the first season was 100% functional, and the addition of the Java was unnecessary.<br /><br />The actual video is great. If it wasn't for the documentation and Java issues I would be giving it a 5. Because of those issues, I am giving it a 4.<br /><br />One other comment: the episodes are 51 minutes long. That means back then there were only 9 minutes of commercials in an hour. O the good old days!
0345803485|1.0|I read all types of books. This falls into the \\"Twight\\" genre. Seems to be written by a teenage girl or for them. Seriously, the stupid inner goddess she is continually referring to is annoying and the book could do without that whole dimension completely. Not to mention that she orgasms at the drop of a hat. The male character seems to constantly be on Viagra since he can have extended, repeated sex without any downtime. This is beyond unrealistic and I was bored halfway through the book. Don't even care to look at, much less read, the other two books.
B001QXCYZY|5.0|Just arrived today--tested with iPad2 and MacBook Pro. Works perfectly with Garageband on both devices. Connects seamlessly on both. Even tried with Logic Pro on iMac, but I have other better options there. For location recording this will be perfect--very simple setup, no power needed! Sturdy unit, easily mounts on mic stand--very solid. Tried third-party software (e.g. Audio Hijack, Audacity). Prefer Garageband. Will be perfect for location concert recording. Nice sound. I have an Zoom H2 that does very well, too, but C1-U works alone with iPad (H2 needs powered hub). Success story!
0345803485|5.0|So many people are really laying into this book and the author. Look people, it's erotic romance; it's not Hemingway. It's a light and easy read, so it might even sound juvenile in the writing style at times but stop criticizing it like it was supposed to be a life-changing book. It's smut, so deal.

0062060562|4.0|Christine is an amnesiac. She had head trauma in her late 20s and now her short term memory does not convert her memories into long term, so each morning after she sleeps, she wakes up with a clean slate. Ben is Christine's husband, the man who has cared for her since her accident. Other than him, she only communicates with Dr. Nash, and she does so in secret because Ben has expressed disdain for doctors. Dr. Nash encourages her to keep a journal to help her with her memory to possibly work toward a cure.<br /><br />Before I Go To Sleep is a well-written, gripping, and creative novel that I could not put down. (I read it in a 24 hour period.) The story is told from Christine's point of view, so the reader is along for the ride, knowing only what she knows and trying to fill in her memory gaps with the clues she leaves behind. Who is Adam and where is he now? Why can't she remember Ben? Why is a night on a rooftop watching fireworks significant? It is all wrapped up nicely in a satisfying conclusion. I highly recommend this entertaining page turner.
B008KW43TE|3.0|I enjoy this album haven't listened to the entire album yet though. He has a good voice ant he's a great writer. Definitely a front runner in R&B today! He's not cliche and his songs are not songs you've heard before!!
B008D28HYS|1.0|It is starting to make sense as to why there are so many data mining apps are offered as the FAOTD. They don't need as much money from the actual app because they are making money from the data they are taking. It's kind of like how newspapers and magazines work. They make more money when more people have them, even if they have to drop the price to get more subscriptions. And like newspapers and magazines, this is not sustainable!
B006LSZECO|1.0|i am probably a very naive person to expect from two young people in love to have some civility towards each other when this feeling is gone. the gone girl is not a mystery i expected, it is a story of mutual conniving and meanness to achieve a ....revenge?! on the other partner. the convoluted plan of amy to disappear in order to make her husband look guilty of her death....the helpless husband who cheats , drinks and gets into trouble....the eventual comeback...<br /><br />i was thoroughly disappointed in the plot and will not try any of the this authors books.

0345803485|1.0|Her writing is horrible. Crap characterization and she never stays on track. Sometimes in the middle of a paragraph I'd reread it several times and didn't know what was going on. Like the horrible twilight books but nothing interesting. Author needs to learn there are other words besides \\"behind\\" for someone's butt. Read halfway through the book, at most, and gave it away. Don't waste your time, there is better written smut on the internet.
1476712042|4.0|Finished Beautiful Disaster. I was hoping I could knock this one out in one day, but sadly, I didn't have the time to dedicate to it that day so it took two. Oh well.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is an emotional rollercoaster for sure! And I loved every second of it. Some people read 50 Shades of Grey and can't tell you why they liked it. That's kind of how it was reading this book for me--like watching a train wreck but not being able to stop watching. I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The description tells you that Travis and Abby make a bet. If Travis wins Abby has to stay at his apartment with him for 30 days. If Abby wins, Travis has to abstain from sex for 30 days. Knowing that Travis is a huge playboy, a one-and-done-don't-even-bother-giving-me-your-phone-number-because-I'm-not-going-to-call-anyway, makes Abby's decision to agree to the bet easy! Travis without sex for 30 days is something Abby has to see. Travis and Abby become best friends, and no one understands why. But of course feelings begin to develop, and living together complicates matters.<br /><br />What I thought would take up the entire book only took about 40% of the book. So I began to wonder what in the world the remaining 60% of the book would cover. Obviously some ups and downs were to be expected. But man...there was so much more than I imagined. A rollercoaster is really the only way I can think of to describe it. There were highs, lows, loops, corkscrews, helixes, and when you get off the ride your clothes and hair are completely windblown and knotted up.<br /><br />Kara, Abby's roommate, hit the nail on the head when she said that Abby and Travis have a codependent relationship. And while the whole time I'm reading this book, I'm rooting for these characters to get their act together and work it out, I'm also thinking \\"this is so not healthy.\\" Talk about truly flawed characters. But I loved it. I felt like I was reading about real people. And while they made really stupid decisions sometimes, it was nice that most of their problems weren't the typical problems I've been seeing in books recently. Sure, the setup of bad boy attempts to settle down for a girl he falls for, and the whole bet being a catalyst for building and growing their relationship isn't anything new. But the rest of it was much more than I was expecting.<br /><br />This book did have an excessive amount of potty mouth and plenty of scenes I wouldn't recommend for younger readers. But I didn't feel like this book had an agenda. It wasn't trying to tell people that this is how they should behave--or these are the politically correct views to have. And to me that was refreshing. I could read and enjoy the story for what it was. Flawed characters. Bad decisions. Unhealthy relationships. A fictional story. A relationship where people screw up, but not for a lack of trying. 4 Stars for Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />I will say that I felt closure at the end of Beautiful Disaster, so to say I'm nervous about Walking Disaster which is told from Travis's perspective is an understatement. But with as much as I enjoyed this book, I'll definitely be checking it out.<br /><br />Have you read Beautiful Disaster? What did you think?

B00846REIS|5.0|I'm not the best at writing reviews but coming from someone who loved the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; trilogy, I actually preferred Bared to You even more. I found Gideon Cross to be much more likeable. He, in my opinion was much sexier and a lot less whiney. I also preferred the female lead of Eva. Its a very steamy but fast read for me. Can't wait until the next book comes out.
0307887448|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Ready Player One.\\" I had some initial trepidation in reading the novel as I feared it would only be fanboy cronyism delivered by a lackluster plot and character development. I was mistaken.<br /><br />Ernest Cline's writing is reminiscent of Doctorow and Stephenson at their best. The story is very compelling. I don't give my self much time for idle pursuits, but I found I had a hard time putting this book down. Many of the reviews site the \\"80s nostalgia\\" throughout the book - and this initially concerned me. However, Cline's use of pop-culture is much more than a stream of know-it-all 80's refs. The cultural phenomena mentioned throughout the book extend beyond the 80s - though are largely delegated to the 80s. Do you remember the passé term Gen-X? Are you Gen-X? Are you a nerd? If so, then you'll be impressed how Cline meaningfully interweaves pop (and nerd) into a plot line to provide an engaging story.<br /><br />In summary, I was superbly amazed by how well he delivered likable characters, avoided any sorts of annoying stereotypes, and crafted an engaging plot while referencing nerd and pop culture in a superbly entertaining way.<br /><br />That being said, I did have some questions about a couple of minor technical issues.<br />1.) Brief discussions of education will seem (unfortunately) perfectly innocuous to many who are not familiar with education beyond \\"I sat in a desk 20 years ago.\\" If you don't know what constructivism or constructionism is, you won't notice anything remiss. [If you do, don't worry. I'm overanalyzing 1 or 2 sentences.]<br />2.) How was a double wide on stacks that hold single-wide trailers (or busses, or shipping containers)? A double-wide is twice the width of other trailers, how could it be stacked above a single wide?<br />3.) (Free and) Open-source software is great and has significant impact and promise for our world. It was nice to see that OASIS was \\"open source.\\" However, if OASIS was open sourcewhy weren't other OASES opened? Why couldn't users craft their own gear? I appreciate that OASIS made its money not with proprietary blobs but by selling a service (as one does with FOSS) but it seems there's a little awkwardness to the open-sourcedness of OASIS sometimes.

6305428042|5.0|I'm a 21-year-old college student who will ALWAYS love this movie. When I was really young, maybe 4 or 5 (around 1995) , I remember this being on TV and watching it, loving it, and being scared by it all at the same time. For young viewers, it can be intense, but not overly traumatic. Every year it comes on on Halloween, and its' a must-watch. I finally bought it on DVD a couple years ago and I do not regret it one bit. It has been viewed many times, and it's so good that I often watch it during other parts of the year. Rainy cold, dreary nights make for a good setting to watch the movie. The story is phenomenal, a bit of Salem Witch Trial history, classic legend, classic young kid who wants to impress his crush. Without giving everything away, it's an adventure from start to finish. It's one of those types of movies where you imagine how fun/scary it would be if it would be possible to occur in real life. There's a lot off comedy, and the acting is actually pretty good! The actors/actresses portray their roles well, and flow together nicely. This is a classic that needs to be in every Halloween fan's DVD collection. It would be cool if it were to be released on Blu-Ray, however I'm not sure where the company stands on it. I loved being a 90's kid and this movies ALWAYS brings me back. GET IT NOW!<br /><br />EDIT: Hocus Pocus will be on Blu-Ray on September 4th, 2012.
B003UESJH4|4.0|I have to admit to being a sucker for these kinds of historical dramas, and for the period in which this one takes place (the eve of World War II).  For those that don't know the history, a brief synopsis is this: The old king (George V) is dies leaving his eldest son Prince David as the new king (becoming Edward VIII).  Unfortunately, all David wishes to do is hold hedonistic parties with his twice-divorced girlfriend Wallis Simpson.  When he finally decides to marry her, he must abdicate (the constitution then did not allow marriage to a divorcee), bringing Prince Abert.  Because he was the second son, \\"Bertie\\" had no expectation of becoming king - a good thing too, because he had a terrible stutter and really, the main duty of a constitutional monarch is to serve as a neutral (apolitical) figurehead around whom a nation can rally in times of joy, sorrow, or crisis.  As such, his only real duty is talking to people and speech-giving, obviously not a forte for a stutterer!<br /><br />The film starts well before this, at Prince Albert's first formal/official speech, closing the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, also being broadcast to the colonies.  At a time when the British Empire encompassed 1/4 of the world's population, this was a large audience.  Thus we have a growing crisis at home (Edward VIII's dalliances) coupled with one abroad (the rise of Germany and Hitler) at a time when the British monarchy is itself in trouble.  This is certainly ample fodder for an historical drama, and the world events and context of the film's story is always kept alive through judicious use of newsreel footage, overheard radio news broadcasts, etc.<br /><br />But, of course, this is film is not a history of the British monarchy through the depression years.  No, this is a personal journey of discovery and healing (if treating a stammer can be termed as such), which depends vitally on the principle actors and the screenplay.  Into Bertie's dry and officious world enters Lionel Logue - an unapologetic Aussie speech therapist with unofficial credentials and unorthodox methods.  The story is remarkably moving, funny, and engaging, given the subject matter.  Bertie and Lionel both have subtle yet smart senses of humour, and the interplay between them is a joy to watch.  Obviously the casting is essential here, and both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are fantastic in the roles.  One of the extras on the DVD (at least, the version I have - which might be different than the one offered on Amazon, based on the disc's description) is a recording of the actual George VI speech that is recreated at the end of the film. It's to Firth's credit that he sounds exactly like the real King in intonation, pacing, etc. (his voice may be a little deeper, but never mind).  This is the first, most obvious observation in watching the actors - they are technically great (Michael Gambon's Churchill is also remarkable - although the film portrays his and George VI's interactions as more friendly than they likely were).  Little is known of Lionel, but Geoffrey Rush, being Australian and a fantastic actor, certainly brings Lionel to life.<br /><br />For me, though, the trickiest and most successful acting in the film is by Helena Bonham Carter.  She plays the woman who became the Queen Mother, the most-loved royal over the last 50 years of her life, a Queen who will be a living memory for most people watching the film (she died in 2002), and a woman well-known to have a sharp wit, a commanding presence, and startling ability to hold her liquor (the last is irrelevant to the story, but is surely one of the traits that added to her popularity as she aged). Bonham Carter plays her part marvellously, as do the two girls playing Lilabet and Margaret (the former now known as Queen Elizabeth II).<br /><br />So, I really enjoyed this film and I'm perfectly happy that it won the Oscar for best picture.  The extras on the DVD are not extensive but are useful - an interview with Lionel's grandson Mark Logue (leeper of his grandfather's diary), the aforementioned speeches of the real George VI, and some other goodies.  So why do I give the film only 4/5?  Well, I reserve 5/5 for films I decide I simply must have because I can't bear the thought of not seeing them again.  While I have great affection for The King's Speech, and would watch it again, it doesn't quite fall into the \\"must have\\" category.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed book two the best out of the trilogy.  Book 1 peaked my interest.  Book 2 answered all the questions I had after finishing book 1.  E L James did irrate me with the excessive use of the fu-k word & holy sh-- comments.
0345803485|1.0|Not because it is too \\"raunchy\\" but because surely anyone reading it must be too embarrased to let anyone know what they are reading.  It is positively the most inane, trite, senseless and badly written book ever to make the bestsellers list.  A sad comment on the modern day society.  That bloody \\"inner goddess\\" - what penalty does the law enforce for murder of a mythical character?????  I bought all three books at once - and then binned them all halfway through the first book (could not even bring myself to pass them on to anyone).<br /><br />I only gave this one star because I could not continue without some rating.  I would prefer to give it a zero.

1400069289|5.0|I highly recommend it to people who want to change habits or are interested in how habits are formed. Because really, just about everything we do in life is a habit. From brushing your teeth, to driving, to what you drink at the office (all are unconscious habits).<br /><br />I have been very interested in how habits form and trying to find good information was hard. Until this book.<br />I loved it. Each chapter was well written and fascinating. I can't understand why anyone wouldn't like the book.<br /><br />For myself, I used it to help me figure out some things I did that weren't easy for me to change and have now changed some bad habits into better ones.<br /><br />I bought it for several people and they all seemed just as fascinated by it as I was.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I have been a hard-core LP fan since the inception of Hybrid Theory. I have listened through all the phases of their music and what an evolution it has been. At a cursory listening of a few songs from this album, I was really put-off by the music and disappointed in the album overall. However, that was the first mistake - I listened to the songs randomly and judged them based on a few seconds of listening to the tune, trying to find the Hybrid Theory/Meteora and not finding that music. I made the same mistake in judging their last album - A thousand suns - which by the way is up there on the top of my favorite album lists. Their music has really matured into a whole new experience, which for me is what LP music is all about. If you want an album with HT or Meteora sound to it, this is definitely not the album for you. HOWEVER, if you want a really really awesome, polished and immense musical journey which is what LP is all about, then I suggest try out the songs (in the right order if I might add) and then judge.<br /><br />Tracks to watch out for - Victimized -> Roads Untraveled, Tinfoil -> Powerless, Castle of Glass.<br /><br />Thats my 2 cents - judge the album after listening to all the songs.

B0085A9J18|4.0|Action movies are a go-to genre for a lot of directors because, like horror movies, they can be made on a reasonable budget with a better than average return. The problem is, like horror movies, a lot of them suck. Not the case here. This is about as good as they get.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. A squad of cops in assault gear head to a dilapidated, 15 story, apartment building, to nab a real bad dude who has a sizable cadre of henchmen at his disposal. Things start out well enough but, of course, go so far south there is even question on how many of the cops will even survive the mission.<br /><br />This is the third outing for Welsh writer/director Gareth Evans who filmed it in Indonesia. What a great idea. That alone must have helped enormously with the budget, and allowed him to turn out one exciting flick at a mere fraction of Hollywood dollars. And this is no mindless martial arts cum shoot-em-up. There are a lot of clever touches in the plotting that took me by surprise. The plotting itself is good. You have some scenes of extreme action followed by quieter scenes so things don't get overwrought, and the audience gets a chance to catch its breath.<br /><br />The shooting scenes are generally good but the martial arts scenes are outstanding. The final fight, two good guys vs. one bad guy, is unbelievable. How they choreographed, shot and edited it is a wonder to behold. The effects are also mind-boggling. Some of the up-close shots to various parts of people's bodies have to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />This is a solid effort. Some might be put off by the fact that it's an entirly Indonesian cast but I hope it doesn't deter possible viewers because they would be missing out on truly great action film. My guess is this will be re-made with an American cast. I would also guess that Gareth Evans is going to get a call from Hollywood that will sizably increase his bank account.

B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I am staggered by the amount of positive reviews for this, frankly, mediocre piece of fiction.  This book is the only one I have EVER sought a refund for.<br />I understand that the author of this book was formerly a prolific fanfic writer, and boy--it shows.  The first chapter alone is riddled with spontaneous (and poorly organized) changes in character POV, trite language, and cliches galore.  I felt like I was reading a 13-year-old's Buffy fanfic.<br />I contacted Amazon for a refund by the end of the first chapter.  I really hate bashing authors, but this is complete trash.
030745455X|5.0|I highly recommend this book if you were a fan of the first one.  It continues to develop the interesting characters from Dragon (particularly the heroine, Lisbeth) against a backdrop of new villains and vividly detailed action sequences.  The plot engages with themes of corruption, exploitation, human rights, sexuality and feminism; these themes add sophistication to the storyline and a layer of complexity to the explicit violence described throughout.  While it is clear that the book is part of a series (referencing elements from the first one and leaving questions to be answered by the third book), the storyline is still well developed on its own with an exciting climax and plot twists throughout.

1594744769|2.0|I came across this book in Target - it was on sale, and had a creepy cover. I bought it a bit excitedly and may have spent my time at the que amping myself up too much. The plot of the novel is great, it really is. It is executed so poorly though! All I can think is that this man's editor should have told him to spend more time on it. The entire book is all tell and no show. Everything is so blatantly obvious and told by a modern Holden Caulfield - whine, whine, whine. I thought it would get better when Jacob would get to the island, but it got worst! There isn't much character development, and he never truly reflects on his situation and/or himself in it. Then... It just ends. Really, just like that and it's done. By the last page, I felt short changed and not sufficiently satisfied with my Target buy.
0142419400|4.0|Wow. Romance. And drama. I have to say, I thought I'd read chick lit before, but I was wrong. Very wrong. Call me ignorant, but I thought I've read a good amount of kissing and love struggles in my lifetime, but this book had me really feeling the heartache and the tension between Anna and St. Clair.  The relationship between Anna and St. Clair was agonizing. But in a good way, if you know what I mean. I'm pretty sure I was yelling at them at one point, \\"Why can't you just see you two are meant for each other!! Gah!! the heartache is unbearable.\\" Anyway, it's probably good I listened to this book while I was home alone. I couldn't control my emotions very well, but that is unsurprising.<br /><br />This book was a quick read, and even though nothing really surprising happens, I really enjoyed it. I started reading this book on my vacation. I was at the beach for a few days, and I could not have picked a better book. It was a lot of fun, despite my desire to shake Anna's brains out so she could stop acting like a stupid teenager.  I suppose that was the glory of the book. Anna and St. Clair were undoubtedly in love, and unbelievably stupid at the same time. It's a classic tale of love and heartache, but I grew to love all of the characters despite their teenage ignorance. I mean, I was a teenager once ☺.<br /><br />On the narration, I thought Kim Mai Guest did a great job at creating new voices and personality for each of the characters. It really brought the story to life. I hated St. Clair's voice at first, but after a while I didn't even notice it. I guess it's pretty difficult to capture that American, with an English accent, who also knows and speaks fluent French, male voice. Other than that, Guest was a very animated story-teller, and I really enjoyed listening to this book.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun romance. It doesn't take long to finish, and you'll probably finish reminiscing about all of your own past or current lovers. Or maybe you'll just be dreaming about St. Clair's fabulous hair. Either way, you won't regret it.<br /><br />I give this book a four out of five fantastic foxes. Despite it's foreseeable plot and stock characters, it was quirky and uplifting. The writing was strategic as the plot moved with ease while still making me beg for more.

0345803507|5.0|I say strangely addictive because I usually read books that are written much better, and have a better storyline. I write for Siren as Autumn Brown(which is a publisher for these types of books), and my editor would have slammed this book back to EL James with so many red marks, repeatedly. I wish the book had been better written. Spelling mistakes, and grammar errors shouldn't make it past the first rewrite. I don't think EL James is too worried about it though. And apparently no one else is either.<br /><br />All of that being said...Somehow I couldn't put these books down. I read all 3 of them in 3 days, which is a record for me. These characters, Ana and Christian were addictive. I couldn't wait to see where they went next. I did have problems with Ana being so passive, and not standing up for herself better, but I just had to see what she was going to do next. I did not like the ending of the first book. Cliffhangers are just cruel! I HAD to buy the second book. There was no choice. I couldn't click on 'Buy It Now' fast enough.<br /><br />All in all, I LOVED this trilogy. And if EL James comes out with any future books, I'll buy them too. And, if 50 Shades gets made into a movie, I'll be in line to buy tickets.

My only disappointment is that there isn't a sequel because I'd love to hear more about Guernsey and characters I've grown to look forward to spending time with. It took a couple letters for me to get used to the writing style but once I did it was so worth it. I loved Juliet's humor and laughed out loud at the letter dated 6th june, 1946 (page 174).

0812993292|2.0|I was hoping it would be an uplifting story about second chances as one ages, and ideally would have a bit of humor or whimsy, but no.  Harold was about as gloomy a protagonist as I've read of, bitter wife, sad sack neighbors, no friends to speak of, and the mystery of why he was taking this 500 mile on foot to see a woman he hadn't know well forty years previously was not compelling and indeed unlikely.  Good for his soul, but not for mine.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I read this book because I had seen that it was rated as one of the best sellers right now. Also, I had seen that other friends had read it as well. I was very disappointed in the book though. The story itself was very interesting and kept me reading but the ending made me not want to recommend it. It is hard to read a book and then come to the end and feel as if the entire book was not worth reading. The author did a terrible job of creating an ending that tied up the book and I have a hard time believing many others would disagree. I was very disappointed in this book and would not recommend it.

B007QZ0LR4|5.0|I have to agree with Santa Fe Listener that these performances are nothing like those of the Alban Berg Quartett or the Busch Quartet. Thank goodness. Those are great readings in their own right and deserve the praise they have received from critics and fans, but this is 2012. Interpretations are meant to change over time, and I think it is to the enduring credit of the Artemis Quartett, who studied extensively with members of the ABQ, that they sound very little like their mentors while still offering fresh and insightful readings that frankly put their predecessors to shame when it comes to ensemble.<br /><br />Anyone who has surveyed Santa Fe Listener's reviews know he is less fond of newer interpretations when it comes to romantic staples. No Gardiner, no Hagen quartet, nothing too crisp or clean, not a fan of less vibrato. That's fine, to each his own. I say this not to openly disagree or to criticize, but to at least offer a filter for those who may be turned off by his three star review. I'm actually surprised he gave them that many stars. If I were a hardcore fan of the Busch quartet I probably wouldn't care for the Artemis Quartett either because their style and interpretation are totally different. For some, this may not sound like Schubert. Maybe they will find it has \\"lack of depth,\\" or that it is \\"subdued and restrained.\\" I feel none of those things. For my taste I am completely engaged and invigorated by their approach that sounds anything but subdued, while still avoiding the pitfalls of most quartets that drag us downward into the excesses of 20th century romanticism.<br /><br />If you have heard the Artemis Quartett in recent years then you'll know what to expect. For fans it is self-recommending. If you don't like the Artemis Quartett, then don't buy this set. If you aren't sure, save yourself some trouble and listen to it for free on Spotify. For my money the Artemis Quartett has consistently provided an ideal balance of modern interpretation and ensemble, both live and in the studio, and since their roster change halfway through their Beethoven cycle they have only improved. Heartily recommended.ensemble, both live and in the studio, and since their roster change halfway through their Beethoven cycle they have only improved. Heartily recommended.

0547569653|5.0|As a reader, I am always looking for a good book that is hard to put down, and Scott's book did not disappoint.  I was a bit hesitant to read it because I knew that it would have some vegan undertones, or so I thought, but it didn't come off a preachy to me.  I felt like he talked about it, but that he didn't try to push it on others.  His stories about running and training were inspiring and have encouraged me to quit making so many excuses and really dedicate myself to training and being healthy.  The book is well written and doesn't have the self-glamourization that other ultra books have.  This is by far one of my favorite books of the year.  I highly recommend reading it whether you are a runner or not.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|whatever you do, don't ever spend money on gems.  All of teamlava's games have gem traps that will cause you to spend all your gems at once without knowing you're doing it.  When you complain they say they don't refund for an exchange as if you meant to spend the gems.  Check out their website and you'll see numerous complaints from players who were dupped into buying gems for something only to have everyone of them dissapear because of the dishonest way these games are set up.  Amazon should not allow these apps because they give Amazon a bad name that they would allow crooks put their apps on the Kindle Fire.  JUST STAY AWAY FROM ALL TEAMLAVA GAMES!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I feel bamboozled by the good and even the middling reviews of this book. I have read many, many books and have never felt as compelled to write a review as after I read this book.  If I could give this zero stars, I would. I made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing the entire series at the same time.  What a waste of my time and my money. I forced myself to finish the first book, but deleted the next two without even looking at them. How many more times could I read about Ana rolling her eyes, biting her lip or blushing.  Or what other god-like qualities could Christian Grey have on top of his billionaire, helicopter flying, piano playing status (etc, etc). Did two 15 year old girls write this nonsense?  I'm sorry, but there is really great erotica out there with believable characters, decent plots and steamy sex.

B008EL4YX6|5.0|One-button puzzle that is easy to learn but challenging fast! I love the levels included plus all of the &quot;community&quot; levels which make for a nearly Infinite number of puzzles! At time of writing there were just shy of 8k puzzles from the community. Great game with a great concept and really good interface.

B002VECMAE|5.0|I saw this movie in a theater and loved it! We had to order it. It was so good. The movie arrived quickly and in great condition!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I really liked \\"Twenties Girl\\" by Sophie Kinsella. I loved the charcters and the story line. I would definetly reccomend this book to all women that like this type of book. It is written specifically, I think, for women...very very good!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I quickly fell in love with the The Hunger Games series. I downloaded it right to my kindle and it's very hard to put on of these books down! It was a really good
0307277453|5.0|I finally finished the book, and I feel so humbled as a human being, and humbled to read such a breakthrough in science literature because of how well this book is written. Shubin makes things easy to understand and makes extraordinary points about how humans can be related to nearly any creature, and how humans are the way we are today. To keep things simple, if you are looking to refresh your biology knowledge or just to read about something interesting, pick up this great read and discover for yourself why this book is so wonderful.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD kicked my butt. It is a great start to my day. Jillian Michaels is very motivating. The DVD arrived quickly and in great condition
B008D28HYS|1.0|Not giving my account info to what otherwise looks like a decent game. Zero stars if possible to anything that asks for this kind of access that shouldn't need it.<br />It's a stupid game and should need little to no permissions to run.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful love story about two people changing for each other for the LOVE of each other.  Growing together.........<br /><br />OK, it put some spice into our lives at home too. :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was better than the first one.  All of the books are pretty repetitive with their verbiage, but most people should be able to get past that and pay attention to the other parts.  This book got more into the stories of their lives than the first, and to me was more interesting.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|Like many of Nick Cage's recent movies, this one has a smirkiness about it that runs all through it. Maybe it's the flat-affect voice-overs that play all through the film. But this seems more like a comedy than a thriller, even though it's about private gun-runners and is loosely based in reality. Many of the scenes are almost slapstick, even when people are getting blown away by his products. If you think this is straight, then the joke's on you.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It is amazing you get to edit the most beautiful pictures and yours to I mean its fantastic! I love it!
B007IQX1G4|5.0|Dark comedy is definatly the best way to discribe 'Young Adult'. The only comedy in the movie is that fact that it seems so realistic and true. I think anyone who went to a typical highschool can relate to knowing someone like Mavis. Super popular, dreams of living in the big city, making it big, etc. This really depicts a realistic situation for someone who has failed at reaching there dream. I really love this film, it's one that sticks with you long after it's ended.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|For a sequel ( or 'franchise' ) movie this comes off very well indeed.  Production values and audio & video quality are first rate.  A home theater demo disc. (I'm speaking of the Blu-ray)<br /><br />Story line is good, believable, in an MI sort of way.  Characters pretty much fit who they should be.  Stunts /special effects rate with the best ever.  What really helps this movie be what it is, is the 'keep it light' bits of ( mostly subtle )humor that run through it.<br /><br />If you want 'Lion In The Winter', this ain't it.  If you want a rollicking Action/ Adventure movie, you got it.  You will be entertained.
B005LAII12|5.0|Easily my new favorite movie. The whole theater was rolling! It's great adult humor! Instant Classic! I can not wait for the release date! I will be making sure I get it!
B008B7OQHM|5.0|This is a great CD, they took some of the best songs off each of their cds and put it onto one. This is worth every penny!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Wow, If I could rate this CD with 50 stars I would! Brittneys voice is just amazing and addictive! Alabama Shakes will go far and I'm glad I discovered them at the beginning! Buy this CD, you won't be sorry. A WINNER!!!
630469878X|1.0|I am very unhappy with the copy of Thelma and Louise that I received....approximately 90% of the way through the movie the picture froze, then the picture became a mass of geometric blocks...pushed the advance button...movie moved slightly but same problem..flickered with blocks and finally froze completely
B008IJTFYW|5.0|As an activity director in the nursing home, this is the best app so far that I have downloaded! It is so calming and relaxing, you can make your own melodies to suit the moment and it has a timer! It sounds so wonderful on surround sound too! Perfect for the SPA CART! Thanks-  One happy Activity Director
0345803485|1.0|I was not able to finish the book; I actually threw it away. I found the book to be distubing, offensive and disgusting. I felt ashamed of reading it. I thought the story was not very believable, and the more I read, the more I disliked the characters. Would not recommend it.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I bought this CD for my sister (who originally wanted it in vinyl version but oops) and was very surprised. By the cover and by who this was, I assumed this was going to be rather loud for my tastes - I'm more of a Jack Johnson than a Jack White fan.<br /><br />However, with her blasting this over the speakers I couldn't help but notice I began to enjoy the music.<br /><br />In a word this man is pure talent. I imagine if he set his mind to something he would do it no matter what. He's a musical genious and had my sister not told me who he was I would never have guessed his 90's music. Definitely a favorite.
B008FOB124|5.0|For me, this album came out of nowhere.  I mean, 16 years since their last work?  How could they possibly create something now as cohesive and powerful as their past works without lame emulation, while retaining their unique sound?<br />Somehow, they have.  This album is an amazing feat.  There is not one weak song here, and each track flows perfectly into the next.  Just when you think that the next song cannot possibly be better than the one you are currently listening to, you are proven wrong.  I cannot even pick a favorite song; they are all stellar.  Unforgettable melodies, hypnotic flow.<br />There is a cohesive, deep feel to Anastasis.  Songs unfurl slowly, seductively.  The instrumentation captivates.  Brendan and Lisa sing flawlessly, and it's impossible to detect any decline that the years have wrought.  In fact, if anything, they have improved with time and experience.<br /><br />I consider this their strongest album.  It is sublime perfection.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I was looking for something to read after The Name of the Wind and stumbled on this gem via Rothfuss' blog.  It was awesome. I would have given the boo k five stars but he beginning was tedious and slow.  Compound that with other slow areas and it dropped the enjoyment factor by quite a little bit.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the world building.  It was a fantastic read and I look forward to the next installment.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hard to add to what's already been said about this great story.  The first Wool was like one of the best episodes of the Twilight Zone, a window into another world that left you wanting to see more. The rest of the Wool Omnibus is like climbing through that window and into that other world.  Once you are in, the narrative doesn't let up, and it doesn't let you down.  It tells a compelling escapist story while exploring some of the larger questions of the human condition.  It transports you and makes you think without getting preachy.  This is exactly what I want my science fiction to do.<br /><br />Some have criticized the second book as bogging down the story, and I'll admit pacing at the start is a bit disjointed.  I believe the author wrote the first Wool as a stand alone short story, and as a result of expanding it after had to use the second book for exposition and world-building.  It isn't uncommon in fantasy and science fiction for writers to have to do this (Clarke, Tolkien, Saberhagen are a few examples that come to mind), and I think the author does a nice job wrapping this exposition up into a bittersweet story that contains information about life in this world that will be essential for books 3-5.<br /><br />For those who don't like world-building, rest assured that once the second book has done it's work, the narrative in books 3-5, where you begin to unravel the mysteries of the silo, more than makes up for it.  Think of the second book as lining up dominoes.  Once they start falling, they are hard to stop, and I found the book after this point hard to put down. For anyone who loves a great story, and required reading for any fans of the sci-fi genre.
B008D28HYS|5.0|love this game...you won't be sorry to download...I only have four puzzles left in the original version...soooo happy to see the color version as FAOTD. I love this game but wasn't willing to shell out $5!!!
B008BIN9EW|2.0|This is a fun game, however I can't get past level six on campaign mode because it always crashes my phone. I am on a Samsung Epic 4G Touch.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|The thing works great. No probe with fudgeing up the ram or anything like that. A cant live without it item for sure.
B0083GPDBO|1.0|The characters aren't very interesting and the home video angle on the movie gets old pretty fast. I couldn't even make it through the first half hour. A bit like a slower version of the Blair Witch project.
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|seriously, do not buy it, the screen is a bad poor resolution, I will say to the Lego Company to stick making bricks and stay away from making digital cameras, this camera is the very worse there is in digital cameras, I even noticed that a $7 disposable camera works better!!! do yourself a favor buy another product, and to top-off the camera its too expensive for the quality that's. Bad, poor, obsolete technology, this camera reminded me of my first digital camera I once bought in Wall mart back in 2000, very poor quality.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|at first I thought all these reviews were too good to be true... like so many people couldn't be so happy with this game. but I got it and love it!! the graphics are great and there's no lag (which is important especially in this game) and its super addicting and the controls are amazingly simple.<br />I love this game and would totally recommend it!! ESPECIALLY because its free! I would have gladly payed for this game.<br />I have had absolutely no problems with it and I love it. :)
B004ZI0NLO|4.0|Wilbur Smith is a favourite writer, however I selected this book with an element of trepidation as the theme of the book was very different from any other of his I had read. I was not disappointed. It may not be historically totally factural but it is well constructed and hard to put down.
B005LMEB8E|5.0|I am already a huge Demi Lovato fan, so I already knew that this album would be more on the pop side. Demi has a great voice for rock, but she really surprised me with her eclectic voice and being able to sing pop just as good. I am looking forward to her next album, whatever style it may be, and will be enjoying \\"Unbroken\\" while waiting for it.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|someone over there is getting cocky because you must think we are stupid if we are going to pay for an app that erases your progress every time you update it. uninstall and never again
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|One of my favorite free apps.  Once you get established by starting games with your friends, it is great entertainment.  You don't need to be an artist -- you just need to be able to get the idea across to the other player.  You can also learn techniques by watching your opponent draw a picture for you.  Every morning and every evening I can't wait to see if there is a drawing waiting for me to guess.<br /><br />The only drawbacks that I have found -- (1) it would be great to have more words available in the free version without having to pay for the upgrade; and (2) it would be great if there was a version available for \\"Nook\\" users.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing and I can't wait to see the movie. Having it on my phone made it so efficient to read whenever I wanted to.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|OF COURSE, IT WAS A WONDERFUL MOVIE.  PARIS LOOKED BEAUTIFUL SO NOW I AM READY TO GO BACK...AND IT ALL ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN PERFECT CONDITION.  THANKS
0345803507|1.0|I caved in to all the hype on these three books (thank god it was only the paperbacks!)and literally bitched to my whole family the entire way through!!! How on earth could such retarted, never in a million years, would or could EVER happen, make the best seller list???!!! I guess you either love the books or hate them. Since I paid for them I forced myself to read them, prompltly giving them away to someone who loved them!! My vote is SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!
B006TLFIAQ|3.0|Jason Statham, Robert De Niro and Clive Owen in an Action Thriller conjures up certain expectations in everyone's mind and the movie comes pretty close to delivering just that.  Great acting of a storyline that is pretty much action interspersed with monotone strategic dialogue which I found lacking.  I think it would have been more of a box office hit if they had added some younger hunks as well as female eye candy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is actually a series of 5 books that tell one damn-good story. I can't imagine reading only one and having to wait for the rest, so I'm glad they come bundled like this. I highly recommend this to anyone. If I were Hollywood I would suggest this be made into a TV series. The wide range of characters and relationships, thought-provoking mythology, and just the right dose of science fiction found in this book has the potential to attract the same cult following that \\"Lost\\" did.
B005LAIHAE|4.0|I accidentally took a nap during one of the action scenes although I was entertained and wanting to watch through the end; the acting was simply too unconvincing and the plot too far-fetched to feel true and believable enough to me to truly draw me in and hook me. Still Henry Cavill is quite pleasurable to watch run around and perform stunts; his half-sister, Ver&oacute;nica Echegui wasn't hard to look at either. Although I enjoyed that it was filmed in Spain, it was just another remake of the regular Hollywood Action Thriller that has been done/overdone to death.
B001974DG0|5.0|I loved this book. My only complaint would be that the main story-line was sooo engrossing that I got a little upset when the author had to cut to a different character's perspective. These alternate stories were necessary and entertaining in their own right, but I really felt at home with the lives of the main characters. You'll hug your dog a little longer after reading this book.
B0000CAQ26|5.0|Quero meu CD, que vocês atrasaram,porfavor quero se possível meu CD dia 06 de setembro, não quero mais atrasos, eu amo esse CD e faz tempo que eu pedi.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|While wildly popular, this book could have been a LOT less explicit. I got the point mid book - The images are very graphic and while I am sure it is an accurate depiction of this type of personality, I wouldn't have missed a few chapters.  Keep reading, the story gets better!

B008IJT0CE|4.0|Great app for relaxing and lots of fun mixing melodies and sounds. Super easy to use and works wonders for restlessness.
0805092447|5.0|This book is my son's FAVORITE. From the minute I bought it on a whim and read it to him, he was in love. He loves the rhythm of the book and gets excited when I ask the question of what each animal sees. The last page (small board book) is a summary of all the animals. Within weeks, he was identifying which animal was which!<br /><br />Some people are complaining about the monkey being replaced by the teacher. While I never saw the monkey, and the teacher does seem like a bit of an odd choice, she (and the children) are my son's favorites. I think he really loves studying human faces and he is fascinated with her. Plus, she has glasses which was nice to compare to my own glasses.<br /><br />I've also seem some reviews criticizing the change to not include a preview window of the next animal. Honestly, it's not even an issue for me? When you ask what they see, it prompts you to turn the page and seems to build the excitement. He will let out a squeal as I turn the page and identify the animal. Usually, as I'm saying \\"I see a red bird...\\" I start to turn the page, not after the sentence is finished. Plus, I give each animal a unique voice which he also loves.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best purchases I've made. I plan on getting many of the other Eric Carle books as well. We have [[ASIN:039925045X The Very Hungry Caterpillar: Giant hardcover edition]] and[[ASIN:0399242694 Mister Seahorse]] books but in my son's opinion, those don't even compare to Brown Bear.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|this game is ok.  I refuse to spend really cash to get more stats or acorns.<br />the only thing I do like is completing a goal.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I want to start by saying after reading some poor reviews on this book and then reading great reviews. I decided to gamble and purchased the book. I absolutely loved this book. I think the only people that can relate to it are those who have actually experienced that true love, which in my opinion only happens once in a life time. :-)
B000MAOLVW|4.0|Kids take note all the scenes here are real. No CGI no animation. Amazing camera work when you consider that size cameras they were working with. The whole movie was shot on film. Great stuff. Over all a great race movie and a great example of true film making.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|I started reading this book and was hooked.  The character of Ignatius J. Reilly is like so many people I (have had the misfortune to?) know, and really speaks to readers...  I did find myself becoming more irritable--but I think that's just because I was so inspired.  A fantastic book, I highly recommend.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The Ice Age Village game is redundant but fun. It always helps pass time when I am bored and playing on the Kindle.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Picked this up as FAotD. Very nice, though font size is too small to be clearly legible on my phone (Galaxy S3).<br /><br />I wouldn't have paid $5 for it - there are better games out there for less - but at $2 I would have snapped it up without a second thought.

B007KZY1YY|5.0|I'm not really into these sorts of books but a friend of mine gave me Fifty Shades of Grey and said that I should read it so I did. I have to say, the books are brilliant! Quite badly written but I think that's better, it seems more personal! I hv now read the last book and have loved definitely worth reading!!!!
B007P06DO0|5.0|Paul Simon is my absolute favorite musician, and Graceland is probably my favorite album of all time. (Rotates between a few other Paul Simon and Simon/Garfunkle Albums) The packaging is beautifully put together set and will look fantastic on your bookcase or displaying somewhere in your home. I have mine on the piano. The reproduction of the lyrics notepad is very cool. Getting to see the lyrics in Paul's handwriting and get a look at the creative process he went through is a real treat. Between that and the documentary that came with the set, I felt I got an intimate look and better understanding of how one of the greatest albums ever came to fruition. The other booklet with all the history is beautifully designed as well. The whole thing is a gem visually.  The documentary that comes with the set is just fantastic. The rave reviews are all very deserved. People have complained that there isn't a lot of music in the documentary? Well, that's not what it was supposed to be about! It found it fascinating to learn all about the politics involved in making this and to hear Paul talk about the process of creating it. I think the negative press he received at the time was ridiculous, and many people now acknowledge that the album was a driving force in ending apartheid because it sparked interest in the country.  I also love how people like Hugh Masakela and Miriam Makeba totally supported him. I love how it told the story of finding musicians, how it changed their lives, how it changed Paul's, and how it changed many people's and the world's view on South Africa. I could write all day about how great this documentary is.  Couple of other things: The sound quality of the CD seems a little less vibrant than I remember. The bonus CD of the live concert is cool I guess but nothing special. The demo tracks are interesting, but I was a little disappointed. Thought they would have interesting takes, but it's clear that the best versions of these songs are the ones on the finished studio album, and on the Concert in the Park album.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game stays true to the characters. scrats mini game is fun too. very cute. create more cash animals please.

1476712042|3.0|The title of the book Beautiful Disaster was extremely fitting for me....parts were beautiful and parts were a disaster. There were things about this book I liked, things I didn't like and things I wondered why they were even in the book.<br /><br />Now I don't want to be hunted down and shot over some of my assessments of this book, but I loved that Travis called her Pidgeon. I am a fan of nicknames, and this one worked for me. I thought that Travis was cocky and goodlooking, a bad boy and just adored by all girls...he was a perfect H in a book. I felt some of Travis' issues with girls was his lack of a maternal influence in his life and for that reason I was drawn to him and wanted to just mother him and help guide him to be a better man. He was extremely obsessive and the way he treated Abby was on the aggressive side - which leads me to our lovely Abs. I really liked how Abby started out with her tough, hard to get ways but she shortly changed. Her going back and forth with Parker and Travis really bothered me. I felt like she played with both them and they were both enamored with her. I blame a lot of Travis' actions on a direct correlation to Abby's actions, seriously she gave up her most prized possesion to him - then left. He thought love she thought goodbye. It was heartbreaking for me to see him deal with those emotions.<br /><br />I really liked the the dynamics between the 4 best friends. They had funny banter and their relationships were very realistic to me. I also, loved Travis' family of men and I thought Abby hung in there with them like a champ.<br /><br />The thing that didn't fit into this book for me was the part about Vegas. I felt this made the book very unauthentic and just didn't seem to make sense. This whole portion of the book just made me want to skip over it and get back to seeing what happened with Trav and Pidg.<br /><br />In closing, the ending was a bit forced for me, but I did like that the author gave them a wrap up for me that I was ultimately rooting and Mrs. Maddox was a nice addition.was ultimately rooting and Mrs. Maddox was a nice addition.
1936719118|3.0|This is not a tactical business book, but more a personal and very honest account of how an entrepreneur discovered his own values and what makes him happy. You will not agree with everything in there, but it'll make you smile, make you cringe, and in the end you'll know yourself better.
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|I wanted to love this show.  I was genuinely intrigued by the idea of a sequel to Phantom of the Opera, but that's what the show should have remained: an idea, and nothing more, because the show itself is a disaster.  Sure, the music is alright, the acting is decent, but it's utterly impossible to overlook the plot holes in this production.  There's just too many parts that simply don't add up.  Raoul as a drunk?  The paternity of Christine's child?  The questionable mental health of Meg Giry?  I realize that over time, people change... but the drastic, melodramatic changes we see in the characters from Phantom in Love Never Dies are just too much to believe.<br /><br />I'm giving LND two stars simply because the costuming and set design are quite well done, so if you'd like to watch a show that knows how to dress its characters and place them in attractive sets, then this is the show to watch.  Beyond that, there's not much else going for this show.<br /><br />My advice:  rather than spending your cash on Love Never Dies, purchase the 25th anniversary Phantom of the Opera celebration filmed at the Royal Albert Hall, starring Ramin Karimloo, Hadley Fraser, and Sierra Boggess.  You'll get beautiful costumes, gorgeous set design, incredible talents, AND a show without glaring plot/characterization issues.  Now THAT is a show worth your time and money.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Love this game! Got a Kindle Fire for my birthday, and have been playing this as much as I've been reading. Love the paper-like artwork and the battle system!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I've watched this DVD numerous times since I purchased it and I'm astounded each and every time at the grandness of this production.  The costuming, the stage design, the sets, lighting, sound design... it is all absolutely top-notch.  Above all, however, I'm continually amazed at the acting talents, particularly those of Ramin Karimloo, Sierra Boggess, and Hadley Fraser.  Karimloo's Phantom characterization is pure genius, as he recreated a character who I used to believe was nothing more than an controlling psychopath who didn't deserve the love he so desperately sought.  And while the controlling psychopath part of the Phantom is still intact, for the first time ever, I truly found myself rooting for Karimloo's Phantom, if only because he gave the character a level of humanity that I think has been sorely lacking in the other productions that I've seen on film or live on Broadway.  There are moments where Karimloo's Phantom shows his vulnerability in new and refreshing ways that made me appreciate the show all the more, thanks to his brilliant performance.  I fully understand why so many Phantom phans (ha!) regard Karimloo as one of the best; I'm just sad that it took me so long to appreciate it.<br /><br />Overall, this production should be considered the standard for how to properly celebrate a historical show like POTO.  The final 20 or so minutes with Sarah Brightman and the four incredible Phantom actors (I'm partial to Colm Wilkinson myself) is a fitting tribute to the history of the show.
1250004217|4.0|There is no shortage of Holocaust literature, both fiction and non-fiction. Being Jewish, I've been aware of the Holocaust my entire life, but everything I've learned has been from the books I've read or the people I've met or the movies I've seen. In high school, in AP History, there was one short paragraph in the entire book. In college, I didn't learn anything about it in any of the history classes I took (and I took quite a few). So, as with most of my learning, I learned by reading. It seems as if for every new book published, one or two of them has something to do with the Holocaust.<br /><br />That being said, I was hesitant to read Sarah's Key. When it was picked for book club, I started reading, but it didn't hook me. It actually took about 50 pages or so to suck me into the story, but once I was in, that was it. I didn't want to stop reading. The story follows Sarah Starzynski through the deportation of the French Jews during World War II, first to the French camps and then, later, to the German camps. Sarah is one of the few to escape (not a spoiler, it happens pretty early on in the story). The book also follows Julia Jarmond, in present day Paris, researching the 1942 roundup of the French Jews. What Julia discovers about Sarah's life is shocking (also not a spoiler, but I can't say much more without it becoming a spoiler).<br /><br />I found myself fascinated by Sarah's story and constantly found myself wanting to know more. The book switches back and forth between Sarah and Julia, and I was disappointed when Sarah's part ended. I wish Ms. Rosnay had continued through her life with the family that saved her, her marriage and family life, but all of that was told from Julia's perspective. Prior to reading Sarah's Key, I didn't know anything about the French perspective of World War II. It was not the Germans that ordered the roundup in '42, but the French. I'd actually like to read some non-fiction about what happened in France.<br /><br />Sarah's Key was recently made into a movie, with Kristin Scott Thomas in the role of Julia. There were, obviously, some pretty stark differences in the translation of book to movie. This is to be expected, but things that were important in the book were completely left out of or glossed over in the film version. I did enjoy the movie - it was interesting to see such a major historical event come to life. The scenes in the camps were devastating, but I liked seeing more of Sarah as an adult, despite the abrupt ending to her life.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in history and/or Holocaust education. It's an important read, if only for the different perspective it provides.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun, but some of the games are kinda weak, and there are so meny ads that it gets annoying very fast.
0307592731|3.0|I expected more.  Gutsy story but I kept waiting for something inspirational or captivating. Author did well to explain the difficulty of the effort.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so diverse and fun to play you cant put it down! free!!! great app to play for fun
0763655465|5.0|I was first attracted to the wonderful illustrations, and then the story grabbed me.  We all mean to be good, but then temptation--especially in the form of cake--comes along!  I was so taken with it that I actually hauled it home from Ireland, where I ran across it, to the U.S.  I wound up using this book for Children's Time at church, and the kids loved it!
B007XH6BPG|5.0|Incredible  well done, what can you expect from these two masters?<br />Just the best of the best, with grwat harmonies as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game!! The card back decoration is also cool. Totally awesome app.  Everyone should have this app. Get it!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the book. Sylvia is an excellent writer. This was a first read for me by this author. Since then, I have gone on and read other of her books and enjoyed them very much. I had read the 50 shades collection first. The book Bared to you was very much like hers.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a great book. Four stars are not given to mediocre stories. The characters are well rounded. Whatever bad reviews are out there have to do with people thinking the plot is similar to that of \\"The Hunger Games\\". I wouldn't know since I have just started to read the second one in the series. What I do know is that it's nice, easy writing, well paced, and inventive enough. The only problem I saw is that it is limited. I yearn for larger-than-life sci-fi, like Asimov and Adams (contradictions and all) wrote.<br /><br />I would most definitely recommend this book. The premise is very catching and it took me a relatively short period of time to complete the series. Very entertaining and good-natured, I think.
B005FISBTO|1.0|I feel bad for anyone shelling out to buy this drivel. Compared to earlier seasons of Dexter, it isn't worth the money. The writers are phoning it in and don't give a damn about the finished product. Showtime doesn't seem to care either, long as people are tuning in. The voice-overs are ridiculous. Dexter is no more the witty killer, he is a lame one who only tells you what you are already seeing. And on top of that he's gone completely retarded.<br /><br />And apparently Dexter is supposed to be the first one at a crime scene, before cops or anyone else: they actually WAIT for him to show up before entering a crime scene! When this NEVER happened before in the show--NEVER! And why do they do it this time? Because the writers need him to destroy evidence that could lead back to him.<br /><br />On top of that, the writers pull an incest plot out of their ass based on one throwaway line from the pilot. SO they are going to ruin a main reveal by putting two characters in bed with each other. Terrific! We've waited 6 years for this character to find out about Dexter and it's going to be shadowed by her sexy feelings for him. Give me a break!<br /><br />Pathetic writing. And people pay Showtime to watch this shit. Absurd. I swear, a group of random people on the internet could write a better season than these so-called professional writers behind this show.<br /><br />I loved this show, the first two seasons are some of the best TV you'll ever see. The following seasons 3 and 4 are not great but still good, and season 5 is mediocre, but this season 6, it's terrible. Never was I bored with this show or shaking my head and scream at the TV the way I did with this season. There's much better entertainment to spend money on, go pick up Breaking Bad.
B008BM9L72|5.0|what a great book!  icouldn't put it down once i started it, really got the imaginiation working in overdrive!!!! The things i learned???? oohlala!!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I enjoy George R. R. Martin's writing, but this is getting old.  I agree with the reviewers who complained about the total lack of plot movement.  This book just makes me think of a schtick from Mel Brooks' movie \\"Spaceballs\\" in which he makes fun of sequels talking about \\"Spaceballs 2:  The Quest for More Money.\\"  I will probably buy the next book, in the hope that the writing I enjoy can be paired with some plot movement in what I see as a useful direction, but that will be the last one if he doesn't do more with the next 1,000 pages.
B008D28HYS|1.0|Excessive permissions ruin a wonderful game. Pay attention to the updates, not just this game but for all apps. When I originally installed Cross Me it didn't include the list of accounts permission. It was added in an update. So disappointed.
0385342063|5.0|This book was really entertaining if you could let go of reality for a while.  Note of caution: there are lots of footnotes, so reading it on the Kindle was a little difficult.  Be prepared for a lot of texting, too.  This was light-hearted, fun chick lit at its best, with a cute plot and likable main characters who had chemistry. I loved that the momentum picked up towards the end, and one of the reasons why it's my favorite book of the summer is that the ending was satisfying, not some rushed, anticlimactic resolution of events.  This was also one of Sophie Kinsella's best; overall, I thought it was a lot better than Remember Me and Can You Keep a Secret. This would probably make a great movie.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|omg this game is cute and fun. the monsters are cute and you even get to play with them. love this game. :D
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game and I play it so much I loose track of time. It really relaxes my mind.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love puzzle games. I got the original crossme on a previous faotd. Both color and the original are fun, and you'll spend a lot of time on them. Whenever someone sees me playing, they try to play also.<br /><br />I'm not sure if there is a free version with ads, but I'm sure a bunch of people would download it also. As it is, I highly recommend these games, even if you have to pay for it. Whether 4.99 is worth it or not depends on the individual.<br /><br />Regarding permissions: most games require permissions. Would I prefer no permissions? Sure, but unless they're excessive, it's not that big of a deal. In this case, the permissions are not excessive in my opinion<br /><br />If you like puzzles, and puzzle games, get it!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game privides the player with a grid and outside the grid are numbers. The number corrispond to how many squares are filled in on that row. From there you just need to find out which square get filled in and what the picture is when you are finished. I have completted many levels without any issue with the operation or saving my progress.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is one of the best games on my kindle fire!!! Its great 4 all ages!My girls luv it an so do I!!! Another must have games!!! Iv been playing it for about 3 wks an it hasn't gotton old! And it is very easy 2 make money for ur upgrades! LUV IT!!!!!
B000244FDW|5.0|This version is simply the best of them.  Elizabeth Garve is superb.  This is the one that I enjoy rewatching every couple of years.  I think Austen would have been very happy with this production.
B004LWZW6U|3.0|For exploitation fans, horror nuts and 3-D enthusiasts, you couldn't find a more fitting film to unofficially end the summer season with than PIRANHA 3DD, the gleefully bad, junky sequel to Alexandre Aja's 2010 hit which - despite its token theatrical release last May - seems to have been shot with the small-screen in mind to begin with.<br /><br />This time out, the prehistoric piranhas have moved along to another group of underground lakes in Arizona, just in time for the relaunch of a water theme park run by college grad Danielle Panabaker and her resident, obnoxious stepfather David Koechner. Having tapped into the water supply where the piranhas are swimming about, \\"The Big Wet Water Park\\" is about to be the site of yet another bloody massacre once the piranhas arrive - about the same time as David Hasselhoff, playing himself as he hits \\"rock bottom\\" as the attraction's big guest star.<br /><br />Aja's original \\"Piranha\\" was an over the top, almost cheerful exercise in horror mayhem, and it's surprising - given the film's success - that the Weinsteins decided to go the cheap route with producing a follow up. Veterans of Dimension's home video sequels including director John Gulager and producer Joel Soisson were brought in to make \\"Piranha 3DD\\" on a clearly reduced budget, with notably diminished make-up effects (gorehounds will surely be disappointed by the reduction of severed heads and limbs here) and a B-list, younger cast (Christopher Lloyd does show up, briefly reprising his role from the original; so does Ving Rhames, who wisely opted to go uncredited under the circumstances).<br /><br />Make no mistake, \\"Piranha 3DD\\" isn't anything close to resembling a good movie, but once you realize this is essentially a trashy direct-to-video sequel - and acknowledge the diminished set of expectations that comes with the territory - the film still provides a modest amount of entertainment. This is especially true when it comes to Hasselhoff's involvement, which yields several big laughs (no more so than when the aging star, in lifeguard gear, runs to aid an obnoxious young boy to the strains of the \\"Baywatch\\" theme). The 3-D isn't anything spectacular - and the thrills never come close to matching the epic carnage of its predecessor - but the movie still provides a fast assortment of corpses, T&A and the occasional cameo from a genre character actor (in addition to Lloyd, Rhames, and \\"The Hoff,\\" Gary Busey is offed in a weak opening sequence). It also wraps things up at around the 70-minute mark and adds some 10 minutes of amusing bloopers that roll over the end credits. It's not good, but it's certainly fun if you can get into the right mindset.<br /><br />Anchor Bay's Blu-Ray combo pack (3D, 2D and DVD) of \\"Piranha 3DD\\" includes a generally good 1080p MVC encoded 3-D transfer. There's ghosting in the image during the Busey sequence, but from that point forward, the natively-shot 3-D looks fine - the issue is that the 3-D isn't particularly well utilized by Gulager, so few effects stand out. The DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack is sound, and extras (on the 2D Blu-Ray) include commentary by Gulager, a couple of deleted scenes, a few featurettes with Hasselhoff, Koechner and Busey, and a worthless four-minute Michael Ratner \\"comedy\\" short, \\"A Lesson with John McEnroe.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a wonderful read! Inspiring words for men and women, old and young, alike. A great story about the perseverance and friendships of a believable young heroine, with a subtle overlay of socio-political commentary. Warning - you will get sucked in and have to finish the trilogy!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The books in this trilogy are not well written. The characters are not even close to being believable...oh wait...this is a work of fiction, they're not supposed to be! At any rate, Ana is an annoying character, similar to the Bella character in the Twilight books; a really pathetic creature, just pathetic. I don't even know what else to write about these books. They are a fast read, I read book one and two in two days. They were enjoyable because I think most women wish they had a billionaire boyfriend that would buy them a new Audi and new clothes and cook for them, buy them a mansion, etc. That's the best part of the fantasy! LOL. I will read the last book in the series just because I'm curious about how it will all end. If you can read these books for free, you're better off. They're not worth the $9.99 a piece on the Kindle to buy. And please, please, please...to the powers that be...do NOT make these into a movie... it would be a flop of epic proportion.
0143119680|5.0|I have never been so enthralled about a book as this one. I couldn't put it down. Once you get past the first couple of chapters, it's nonstop reading. I took every moment I could snatch to read as much as I could. You get a deeper look into the making and workings of a witch and also vampires and daemons. The characters are wonderful, rich in personality. The relationship between the witch and vampire is actually beautiful! Her writing flows and easy to read. The imagery--fantastic! I ordered the sequel and look forward to many hours with Diana and Matthew.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I bought this knife 2 weeks ago, I have carried it to work, I used it at work. Im a meatcutter. Its not a great meat cutter, but it does Break Cow femer bones with 2 HARD Wacks, my friend was shocked, becuase we have a 4 pound cleaver and it takes atleast 3or4 good wacks. This knife is Very COncealable and if you take the belt strap off you can make 2 loops ti fit your belt and make it a IWB carry. I cant talk enough about how good this knife is. I love it, I do think that Camillus used a better steel and better heatreat but this is a great knife none the less.... 5 stars. Would i bet my life on it? Hell Yes.... Phil Out.
B008D28HYS|3.0|Originally, I gave CrossMe Color a much lower score, but Dynamix has answered ALL my questions and put my fears to rest. Below is my new review (taking their answers into consideration):<br /><br />CrossMe Color is a GREAT game. It has more Nonograms than anything else I have seen for the Android OS, however the price seems to reflect this achievement.<br /><br />The object of this game is simple; you have to properly color (or not) the grid (playing field) and form an image. This is done by paying attention to the numbers given on the side of your playing field. Sounds easy enough, right? It's not. This is one of the most difficult brain teasers on the market (and most fun). Think of it as Sudoku on steroids (some of the later puzzles actually make my brain hurt).<br /><br />The UI is excellent, and while there are no actual graphics to speak of (other than the background), the game does a good job of presenting itself. You can zoom in (required on the larger puzzles) and pan the grid however you wish. The sound, while (almost) non-existent suits this style of gameplay. I would like some music to play in the background while solving puzzles (not just during the level select), but I understand why it was not included (it could distract some people).<br /><br />My only complaint is the inclusion of Scoreloop (optional data mining and score keeping), some minor spelling errors (hint is spelled as rint, fill is spelled as filled, etc.), and the incessant begging to purchase the original CrossMe game.<br /><br />The following message surfaces every few games: \\"Do you like CrossMe Color? Try more traditional CrossMe with original crosswords.\\" You are presented with the following three options: Try, Later, and No.<br />Try = The Amazon store page (to purchase of the original CrossMe for $4.95)<br />Later = ??? I have no idea what it does as I always select \\"No\\"<br />No = Keep asking me to buy CrossMe every few times I play.<br />I chose No and the app asked me to purchaseCrossMe again after I loaded the game a few more times. Why even bother putting \\"Later\\" into the game as an option if \\"No\\" does the same thing?<br /><br />All problems aside, this game will provide you with HOURS upon hours of entertainment. While I don't think it's quite worth the $4.95 that Dynamix wants for it, it is certainly worth your download as the FAOTD (just DON'T enable Scoreloop).<br /><br />If they ever remove Scoreloop entirely, I will bump the score up to four stars.<br />When they fix the spelling errors, get rid of the begging to purchase the original CrossMe, and lower the price, I will also add another star to this review.<br /><br />I really think Dynamix is onto something here. The game is a great time waster (if you like puzzles), and very few things stand in the way of making this app almost perfect. However, I still don't think it's worth the $4.95 asking price. Bump it down to $1.99 and fix the problems I mentioned, and this game will be pure gold.<br /><br />I want to give a special thank you to Dynamix for answering my questions and explaining their permissions. Good job on the game!<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL REVIEW IS BELOW (rating this game a one out of five):<br /><br />Title: A great game that may have been created for the sole purpose of gathering your data.<br />It would take too long for me to explain how this game is played. Suffice it to say, it contains a plethora of Nonograms (logic puzzles) to solve and once you understand how to do this, the time simply melts away.<br /><br />The big issue here is that when you solve a puzzle, you are allowed to \\"Tell Friends\\" about it. Clicking this little wonder allows you to \\"share\\" your victory through pretty much any means possible. Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, Google+, text message, or about ten other sources. You do of course have to be logged into most of these things to take advantage of this feature. Combined with Scoreloop, I don't even want to think what could happen.<br /><br />This brings us to the INSANE network permissions for a single player game. These are here solely for the purpose of data mining and \\"score-keeping\\" (thanks Scoreloop!). Here are some nice quotes for you all directly from their Facebook page:<br />\\"Drive discovery and increase sales\\" and \\"Sophisticated social data mining\\".<br />You should also read their EULA, which explains that you give them rights to share your data with their \\"partners\\", which are many because Scoreloop is owned by RIM.<br /><br />But the fun doesn't end here folks, CrossMe Color keeps bothering you to buy the original CrossMe (another $4.95 app).<br />Every so often a window pops up stating this: \\"Do you like CrossMe Color? Try more traditional CrossMe with original crosswords.\\" You are presented with the following three options: Try, Later, and No.<br />Try = The Amazon store page (to purchase of the original CrossMe for $4.95)<br />Later = ???<br />No = Keep asking me to buy CrossMe every few times I play.<br />I chose No and the app asked me again after I loaded the game a few more times. Why even bother putting \\"Later\\" into the game as an option if \\"No\\" does the same thing?<br /><br />It really is too bad, because I enjoyed my time spent with the puzzles included here. The UI is user friendly, and the sounds are alright. If you don't plan on enabling Scoreloop or using the \\"Tell Friends\\" feature (and will play this without an internet connection), you can go ahead and download CrossMe Color while its still free. I wouldn't, because I'm afraid of what the ridiculous permissions combined with Scoreloop can accomplish.<br /><br />When it does go back to being a paid game, I would stay away. There are plenty of free Nonograms available on the web, and they won't steal your data.<br /><br />If they ever remove the on-line \\"features\\" this game has, I would most likely give this game a perfect score.<br /><br />EDIT: I am currently speaking with the developer in the comments section of this review. Feel free to chime in. If everything is explained, I will most likely be bumping up my score of CrossMe Color.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I don't think the book as sexy as every makes it out to be but so far the plot is good
B006WAIV6M|5.0|The initial chapters are more interesting that the latter and the whole book revolves around one single concept called the \\"habit loop\\" - 1) Cue 2) Routine 3) Reward. Nevertheless, its a good read and also a good start for those who wants to get rid of bad habits or to cultivate new ones. After all, no book will give you step by step magical instructions to improve life overnight...its worth reading and I feel the contents would seem more valid and relevant depending on how serious are you to bring about positive and lasting changes in your life....
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is an easy to use, quick loading, app. It gives me exactly what I need regarding weather,  without a lot of slow loading technical info.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day and love it! I don't think i would've paid $5 for it, but its still a good game...
B008D28HYS|1.0|Seriously? Unless you can explain why your program feels it necessary to rape my phone for *personal* information, you shouldn't do it. If there is a legitimate need (haha) for you to access this to run your program then I challenge you to explain in clear terms why. Otherwise it's just another data mining creep.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and it is different from any other game I've played on my android.<br /><br />They keep updating this and adding more levels.  Awesome!
B0006GAOBI|4.0|Let me first say that I LOVE Donnie Darko.  It's a beautiful, heartfelt movie about a troubled young man who sees a giant (scary) bunny.  This movie caused hours of debate between my friends and I when we first watched it.  The fact that it does leave questions is only a part of why I can watch it again and again.  Let's get to why I gave it only four stars.  The director's cut is flawed.  Richard Kelly added pieces from the Donnie Darko book and other images that break up the movie so it doesn't flow as well.  Also, I like the movie starting with Killing Moon by Echo and the Bunnymen as opposed to Never Tear Us Apart by INXS (which is a great song and it works, but it just throws me off cause I had watched it several times before I saw the director's cut.)  Personally I loved the feeling of things being unexplained, which Kelly tried to fix in the director's cut.  There are some great additions though. One of my favorite additions was a scene where Donnie reads a story he wrote in his English class.  So in conclusion, I recommend the movie whole-heartly, but watch the original version before the director's cut.
030758836X|2.0|The book is well written, characters developed wonderfully, great twists. On the flip side, first third is slow slow going. I found myself skipping passages and serious contemplated not reading anymore, but then it got good. I really started enjoying the book and couldn't wait until the end. Then the end....you have to be kidding. After all that, this is it? Disappointed, unfulfilled. The ending would have been ok of there had been a better lead up just something.
B003MWHVLY|4.0|Born to Be Free is much different than her last album. It has a much more produced studio sound. Not overproduced but studio nonetheless.<br />I would certainly recommend purchasing this if you like to hear some sold female pipes!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|This is the cutest little game. The monsters are adorable ...to bad they have to fight...but that's even cute! Do yourself a favor. and try this one out!
B003UMW66Q|5.0|HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR is easily the most consistently satisfying American movie musical since \\"YES, GIORGIO.\\"  If only we could leave the gang back another semester for HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 4: RETURN OF THE DUNTZ CAPS...
B008JH5FZ6|5.0|This is a very cool and interresting movie. Lots of action. It doesn't feel like a movie that's been done many times before to death.
0062073478|5.0|This is the grandaddy of all murder mysteries.  This is the story that created an entire genre of \\"a group of people locked in an isolated location and one by one, they all start to die?  Who is the killer and who will make it out alive?\\"<br /><br />It's an ingenious premise that's been copied and ripped of in other novels, movies and board games in the nearly 80 years since it's been written.  Imitation is the best form of flatter and none do is as well as Christie.  Movies like Clue, Murder By Death, The Last of Sheila and many others have paid homage to this fantastic book.<br /><br />Christie paints vivid characters, each with a dark secret.  The story is a fantastic metaphor for anyone who has a secret and the price that's eventually paid for it.  We've all been there.  We've all thought, \\"I wonder if anyone else knows about this and what if they do?\\"  Christie weaves a terrific dark tale of the prices that are exacted for dark secrets.<br /><br />Just when you think you know who the killer is, that person fall prey to the killer and you find yourself starting all over again in your deductions.  It's a mystery that's nearly impossible to figure out but that won't detract for the fun you'll have has you turn pages faster and faster as the suspense amps up as you near the finale.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|My husband and I watched this series on BBC television and loved it.  I may have to replace my copies of the series, however, since my 22 year old is captivated by the production and is monopolizing my videos!
B008BIN9EW|2.0|this game looked promising ..but it doesn't make any sense..it was confusing..too many things to work on at once and the tutorial was hard
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Got this game a day ago when it was the app of the day and have not put it down since. The game play is great (I view it as a cross between Starcraft and Civilization but my friend says it is more like Advanced Wars) and the performance is very smooth. If you're a fan of strategy games I would highly recommend this app. If I had known about this game earlier I would have definitely bought it in a heartbeat. The fact that it has online and local multiplayer, campaign, and solo modes makes this game perfect for all situations.<br /><br />TL/DR buy this game you won't regret it if you like strategy games
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was the type of book that you could not put down. You wanted to continue to read to see what happens next.
0307477479|5.0|I was instantly enraptured, though not all the stories resonated, and I hated Allison's diagrams and Rob's story.  Still extremely good, quite marvelous actually.
B00000IMTH|5.0|This is my favorite of the Dio-era Rainbow.  Each studio album was better than the one before it.  This one being the third and final one with Dio, I believe.  No wonder Tony Iommi wanted Dio in his band after this masterpiece.
0440244870|1.0|The writing was so awful, and the story is not strong.  Rare occasion where the film was leaps and bounds better than the movie.  One of the few books that I might have discarded.
B006QLH7O4|1.0|1 star just because they didn't include a real digital copy, but a useless UV version and their customer service won't offer a code for a real digital copy version.
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams is the greatest composer of music in the last 60 years.  The Harry Potter series is some of his most wonderful work.  Think what the Potter movies would have been without the Williams' themes.  So sad that he was gone from the series after the 3rd movie.  What a great loss to everyone.
B005OTGS4E|3.0|I rented this movie thinking it would be worth a watch, and i was pleasantly surprised as to how good it was. By no means is it anywhere close to WW2 classics like The Longest Day or Saving Private Ryan, but it is a good movie that is definitely worth watching. Sean Bean does a great job as the lead and is rounded out by a cast of nobodies, but considering this was a low budget film, i would say it overachieved and became a solid film.<br /><br />If you don't want to buy this film, then just rent it and give it a look, its worth at least that.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this between my Fire and my phone. I write lists and notes that I need to take with me on the Fire. Then I have them on my phone. I can put important docs from laptop to Fire. I use it a lot.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Finally! A FAOTD that isn't for 3 year olds or full of pay-in-app junk. This is a good game. I just hope we don't have to wait for months for the next decent FAOTD...
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I decided to buy this to sharpen my SOG Flash II pocket knives. I was able to put a decent edge on my blades after a few strokes on the carbide portion first then used the ceramic to finish the edge. Worth the price!
B007SGM084|5.0|There are no words to describe the amazingness of this trilogy. I love that Amazon allows me to purchase the trilogy for my iPad quickly and cheaper than the hard copies!! SOO convenient!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|There are so many paranoid people that love to review Amazon FAOTD games.  Everyone is so quick to jump to the conclusion that if it asks for permission X that it must be mining your data.  The reason for the discover known accounts permission is so that it can synchronize your progress to the cloud.  It uses your email address in order to uniquely identify you.  This is actually a nice feature if you play the game on multiple devices.  Also, it is nice in case you switch devices, you can pick up where you left off.  In addition, the network access is for sharing stuff on facebook.  This, I find unnecessary.  Just a means of hopefully promoting their game via social networking.  Just don't click the share on facebook.  Or, don't click on synchronize.<br /><br />Now for the game.  Pretty much the same as the classic version with different colors.  This gives it a different twist. It can be more difficult at times because it's hard to remember that different colors can be placed right next to each other.  Not a whole lot different.  If you love the classic version and need more puzzles, this is a nice addition.
B0081X40HW|3.0|Her vocals have a lot of character and the piano sounds great in the songs where it's featured. I like that she has a throw back 60's soul sound.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|I didn't already have it on CD, so i'm glad I bought it. Would have liked to see the two-disc version that was rumored, but this is a nice supplement to the old vinyl.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|I absolutely love this album, but not for the same reasons I like Adam's previous work.  These are much more formulaic, with quite a bit of influence from something like One Republic, and the lyrics aren't nearly as quirky and intelligent.  Also, his signature synth sound from Galaxies is practically gone, showing up for a few bars in Good Time and nowhere else.<br /><br />Not impressed with Good Time either as his collaboration with Jepsen pulled him toward the uninspired repetitive teen-pop she's famous for.  Also, he somehow got talked into adding \\"woah\\" to just about every song...must have picked up a new producer this year.<br /><br />Well, now that I got that all out of my system, I still give it 4 stars as a dance/rock album that I've already added to my workout playlist (all except for Silhouette).  Silhouette is fantastically beautiful, Shooting Star is upbeat and positive as are Dreams And Disasters and Gold.  I was disappointed Take It All Away was a downer as I've always been a huge fan of the whimsical positivity in most of Adam Young's lyrics, but it's still a catchy song.<br /><br />Note to Adam: please don't let success force you into spitting out formulaic music \\"guaranteed to sell\\" by the record producers!  You've got a unique style that comes along rarely and I'd love to see more stuff in the vein of Brielle, Galaxies, Tidal Wave, and Vanilla Twilight with their complex beats and synth work and creative lyrics.  Also, where the heck is \\"In Christ Alone\\"?? The copy from your blog is good, but I sense you could do more with it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|i love that  rovio keeps comeing out with new apps. and new app updates. I LOVE ANGRY BIRDS YAAYYY! and i was so excited for angery birds space i got it the first day it came out.

B000L3CHC0|5.0|I was looking for a new watch, nothing too fancy or bold. PRC 200's classy style really fits my taste, and Tissot's quality definitely excels at this price range compared to similar brands.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very well designed and built.<br />The crystal bezel is absolutely stunning.<br />The yellow hand (which is not the second hand!) and other counter hands are beautiful.<br />Band is very sturdy, and it looks like scratch proof as well.<br />The brown is designed so that it can be screwed (by hand) in to ensure better water seal.<br />The lume is not only on the hands, but also on the indicator for each hour. (Which is one of the common missing feature from knock offs. I'm not saying I can vouch for this to be authentic, but the full lume and build quality on the watch as well as the box itself did convince me.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />The watch base is a little smaller than appeared on the photo, but doesn't really concern me that much.<br />The big yellow hand is actually the 60s counter, not the second hand. The second hand is the lower central small hand, which is really disappointing, because it's such a waste that beautiful yellow hand does not get used as much.<br />Another thing to notice, anything from a non-authorized retailed for Tissot won't come with warranty. No exception here.<br />I also noticed that it's easy to get fingerprints on the band and the crystal, but I don't think any other watchmaker can avoid that.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with the value of this watch. Considering the price, it's even better. I'd recommend this watch to my friends and family.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app works very well in the kindle fire. the app makes repining a breeze. It would be perfect if it loaded faster.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like all the links to further insight on this version of the Bible.  Also, I enjoy the audio.
0143034901|3.0|Ordinarily I don't criticize books with over 800 comments.  But there are issues that deserve attention.<br />The Good:  The novel is well written.  The plot is interesting yet somewhat confusing.  Errors aside, the premise is well considered and fresh.  Zafon's writing is crisp and accomplished.  He clearly understands his objective, has a good ear for dialog and is engaging, witty and often funny.  I enjoyed his allusions and illusions.  His Gothic horror is well constructed, economical, driven and fascinating.<br />The Bad and the Ugly:  Criticism of its length and quality of the translation are justified; the work could well profit from tighter editing and fewer spelling errors.  I was maddened by many modern idioms in a novel from the past mid-century.  There are too many characters that hardly contribute to the story line.  The Hollywood style, Goldilocks ending feels contrived.  There are many physical and medical errors and inconsistencies.<br />However the greatest deficit of this novel, and the main reason it fails, is the cheap use of too many voices.  It takes great skill to present literature a reader understands from a single point of view.  Perhaps I am being is too critical and others can stomach this schizophrenia but the author depreciated his work by taking the easiest route to get from point A to B.  One cannot have it both ways; either the author speaks from a uniform and clear viewpoint or the work become a conglomeration of mismatched, uneven contributions.  Consider any truly great work (choose your favorite author) and ask whether that piece suffered or benefited from a chorus or a solo.  \\"Call me Ishmael\\" set the standard.  Zafon failed the test.<br />Summary:  I liked the work.  It is interesting and worth the read.  I enjoyed many pages and wondered what I would do under those circumstances.  Zafon is a fresh voice with solid power and skill.  Yet the book could have been much better.
B007RD4KQ8|5.0|I must admit I was skeptical about all this. Im a huge fan of both Gillan and Iommi. I have been dissapointed over the years with quite a few of their projects and Products. They definatly sifted through allot of rubbish and picked out allot of quality tunes that might have been passed over through the years. As the previous reviews state, allot of different colers and styles here yet it flows well. A great listen all the way through. I have always loved Born Again, Zero The Hero finally gets the mix it always deserved. One of the most poorly mixed Albums in Metal History should get the full Makeover with todays Technology. Having said that, dive into this collection. It is so worth it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so awesome nothing is better then the makers others.by the way if you like my reviews on other games (if you don't now what I'm talking a bout then look on review on where's my Perry)if you.do like my reivews then if you wont me to reivew  a game then add ojm to the end of title and I will reivew it love my fans(I don't have fans yet but I will
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the games...much easier to navigate with a stylus though...if u have one....use it..it. does help..too many ads ;but again..with the stylus its easier to avoid hitting the ad button on bottom of screen.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I bought the G13 earlier this year. I was debating between a MMO mouse that had alot of macro buttons, something like the Naga or the M90, or a game pad. After talking to some friends who use gamepads, they recommended this one over the Razer gamepad. I have to say I love this thing. I couldn't imagine playing without it anymore. Using a Mouse and keyboard since the early UO days, I thought I would have a harder time switching over to the gamepad, particularly the thumb stick. But I actually took to it alot faster then I had originally thought I would and within a week I felt very comfortable with it. A few months later even more so.<br /><br /> This gamepad is very comfortable. I have medium sized hands, and I don't have a problem reaching all of the keys. The response time is great, the keys are comfortable to click, not too soft or too hard. The thumbstick retains it's spring centering very well and has lost very little or no rigidness at all, staying tight and not having any play after several months of continuous use.<br /><br />The display is great, I typically use it for ventrilo to show who is talking etc, but I often also use it for it's integrated screens for games that have them. Guild Wars 2 has already implemented software for this gamepad, showing things like Stats, % of map explored, how many treasures/secrets in that zone you have discovered. Things like that. It is really neat. The colors on the backlighting are bright and easy to read on all the keys.<br /><br />If you are willing to spend the little time it takes to make a profile for each game you play, you will be happy with this product. It does have auto profiles for alot of games, but we buy these things to modify them to our liking right? Not so we can have a bunch of preset profiles for games. The macro software is easy to use and efficient. If you are on the wall about this product, either not sure about this or the Razer, or if you were like me and considering using a gamepad for the first time I recommend this product. It is cheaper then a new keyboard and about the same as a mid-high end mouse. I think you would be pleasantly surprised.
B007SGM084|1.0|After reading all three books,I concluded that I was royally ripped off by the author and her slick promotion gurus and Amazon! I learned a valuble lesson - read the customer reviews and put no faith in the Amazon star rating. The author has poor writing skills, and is overrated. I cannot believe this series made the NY best seller list and continues to mislead readers. I now wish I had donated my money to a charity instead of to the authors bank account! The characters sucked! The juvenile behaviours, the repititious phrases, the attempts at erotica became annoying. The customer reviews were better written and far more interesting.
B003ZMF26W|3.0|I was in the market for a new mouse. I wanted something that had a couple additional macro keys, but I didn't want something like the M90 or the Naga. I stumbled on this mouse pretty much on accident and even though it had limited reviews, they were favorable, and I have been happy with other Cooler Master products in the past, even if they were not things like mice or keyboards, so I thought I would take the gamble and give it a try.<br /><br /> I am very pleased with this mouse. As the majority of the other reviews mention, it is very comfortable. I have medium sized hands and the curvature and ergonomics of this mouse are pleasing. The quick fire keys are easy to access with minimal effort. The thumb keys are as equally easy to access with minimal effort and are not hit on accident. The mouse is of moderate weight. Not too light but not too heavy. It feels and looks well-made and the large footpads on the base make the mouse very smooth on most surfaces.<br /><br /> The mouse looks great. I think it is a pretty sexy mouse, with the various lighting schemes you can do with it. One thing I was slightly disappointed with, is that you can't modify each light and it's glowing effect individually. There are 4 preset lighting schemes in the software for the mouse, and you can assign them to each of the 4 macro profiles accordingly. You can use the same effect on every profile if you want, but you can't mix and match the effects as you please. For example you can't use the flash on click of the front lights and the breathing emblem on the palm at the same time. Because none of the preformulated lighting schemes have that combo. Other then that though the mouse looks great. The mix of flat black and gloss on the mouse compliment each other nicely and add a bit of texture friction to the areas you want it.<br /><br />The software isn't the best, but it works. Once you figure it out, it will get the job done. There isn't as many macroable buttons though as the mouse advertises. The mouse does indeed have 11 buttons. But I would say that it really only has 5 macroable buttons. That being 2 thumb keys, middle mouse, and the 2 quick-fire buttons that are on the sides of the left and right mouse buttons. I say this because in most cases you aren't going to remap your left and right click, and even though there are 3 buttons on the thumb, only 2 of them can be remapped. The third button, the one furthest back, cannot be remapped. It can only be used to open the macro software. Below the middle mouse you have 2 more buttons which by default are used to adjust DPI and sensitivity on the fly, and they also can not be remapped. They can only be used to adjust DPI and sensitivity. Below those buttons is the profile selection button. This button also cannot be remapped. It can only be used to change the current profile the mouse uses. So like I said, yes there is 11 buttons but only 5 are really remappable, useable buttons.<br /><br /> If you are willing to work with sub-par software, and less mappable buttons, this mouse is a good buy. I have no regrets about ordering this product. It is unique in that not many people have or have even seen a mouse by Cooler Master, and this one is impressive to look at and looks great with my Black/Red/Amber themed rig. The price is fair for what you are getting, if you considering this product I would suggest trying it out. You can find better products for slightly more money, but I think most will be happy with this product.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Love it love it love it love it!!!!<br /><br />Just tested this with Skype...wish there were many more people that I had to call!

B007L6VR6M|5.0|As I sat through this work of art in my local theatre, I couldn't help but keep a smile on my face from the beginning credits to the end. It's been many years since Mr. Anderson delighted us with his presence with Bottle Rocket and has never cease to amaze with every following film, Rushmore being my favorite of all time. But Moonrise Kingdom is a sort of an ode to this beautiful man and the great films he has given us. He can simply bring a script to life and make you believe its an story book tale. Moonrise Kingdom gave me a beautiful feeling in witch I haven't had since watching Rushmore years ago. This movie is a thing of beauty and makes you urn for young love. I have never recommend a movie so much, to anyone with a heart or sense of humor. Best Wes film since royal tennenbaums.
0783225547|4.0|The small town of Dante's Peak in Oregon is threatened by a volcanic eruption, which soon turns the entire area into something closer to Dante's Inferno. Nobody really saves the day, but most of the main heroes at least get away - barely.<br /><br />That's the basic plot of \\"Dante's Peak\\", starring Pierce Brosnan, Linda Hamilton and Charles Hallahan. Note the bizarre similarity between Linda Hamilton and her \\"daughter\\" in the movie!<br /><br />I'm somewhat ambivalent to \\"Dante's Peak\\". On the one hand, it's not bad as Friday night entertainment goes. On the other hand, we have seen most of this before, haven't we? All the usual stereotypes are there. Isn't it amazing how long you can survive close to a volcanic eruption? Not to mention that dog. And no, Hamilton is *not* convincing as mayor of a small mining town in fly-over country. You can take it from me, I'm a feminist!<br /><br />Still, I give the film four stars out of five. I actually saw it on a movie theatre back in 1997, under very strange circumstances which I won't recount here. So for old times sake...OK, four stars it is.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is a decent RTS with around 21 single player levels right now. The multiplayer is good.  Only real downside is the short single player game and the obvious face that this is a blatant Starcraft ripoff.<br /><br />Would only give 3 or 4 stars but the one star tools are out in force.  Can't play or install or figure it out?  All 21 levels are a giant tutorial.  Or maybe go read the 'HOW TO PLAY' doc off the menu.  Idiot 1 star people.
B003UBTX72|2.0|If you are a musician, this book is for you. If you are a fan, it is okay. Reading about the drug busts and putting things in chronological order of them is okay. I just found this book hard to get through, and not a page turner.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This was not a book I took a liking to. Housewife entertainment at its best I think. Would not recommend it.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I respect but do not understand those who gave this movie less than five stars. Everything about it was perfect! I've seen a lot of superhero movies and only Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy comes close to this.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I saw the book and how trending it was on Good Afternoon America and thought I would read the first few chapters on Amazon. I honestly could NOT get through the first paragraph without finding awkward sounding sentences and phrases. Honestly, when I was in middle school I had friends who wrote better than that! The sentence flow was simply awful and the half of a paragraph I read just had choppy sentences. Seriously. how did this lady pass elementary school? These basics is what a little kid works on until high school!<br /><br />I simply do not understand how people can even get passed the first paragraph.
B006XOBFJC|5.0|Even if you have some of the top Rings, i.e. Solti, Furtwangler, Krauss, etc., this Ring is a refreshing surprise. The cast is excellent, as is the conducting, and the quality of sound is superb: clean, clear, and dynamic, with no \\"live\\" extraneous noises. This is the best bargain available for Wagner's Ring, and is an excellent complement to any music library. There are 14 discs, and though the set has no libretto, it's available online for free to peruse while you listen. I am VERY glad I bought this set!

B008AWBQGW|2.0|I am a huge Lynyrd Skynyrd fan, of the old band and the current band. Nothing will touch the Ronnie Van Zant era. I have been listening to this cd for about a week now and it is rated as my least favorite Skynyrd album. It has a few ok tracks but over all it stinks. I played the record for my 17 year old daughter who is a Skynyrd fan and the first comment from her was it's weird and I agree. The vocal effects are done to much and the lyrical content is just weird. I don't know if it is to much John 5 influence or the alternative influence from the producer, it is just a weird record.It is hard for me to write this review because I love the guy's but this record is depressing to me personally.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great.. It tells you anything you need or want to know, from battery health to the amount of stand by hours the charge can withstand.  This app is definitely a must have.

B004X60QE2|5.0|Now that the series has ended, I wanted to go back an relieve the series. This is great and has all the episodes, and deleted scenes. You have the option of \\"playing all\\" or choose the individual episodes. It is worth getting if you love the show.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|One of the most stupidest movies EVER!!!Does not deserve a star even. Waste of time watching it. Bad script, bad performance and complete challenge of audience's intelligence.
B0036T31YY|1.0|If you are the type of person that wants to feel good about yourself by making up some kind of meaning to this useless movie so that you feel smart, then you might like it.  If you are the type of person who enjoys a movie because the writers actually wrote something worthwhile, look elsewhere.

B008JIFJ4W|4.0|Gossamer does not have the immediate pull of Manners, but the high energy indie-rockers show that this record has great replayability.  Upon first listen you may be thinking \\"Where's the 'Sleepyhead' or 'Little Secrets'\\" but you will find yourself remembering the powerful choruses in this record in no time (You may be finding yourself saying \\"Sylviaaaa\\").  Gossamer has the feel of Chunk of Change but you can sense the lyrics on this record are more serious and to a point than of its predecessors.  This is an album that can be enjoyed on its own by the casual fan or a passion pit follower, seeing a band prove its staying power and tackling the often talked about \\"sophomore effort.\\"  As of now, in the top 5 albums released this year.  4/4.5 out of 5.
B005HSL626|5.0|Stop complaining about ads if you don't like the ads and buy the one for $0.99 and you just uninstall it over some stupid ads? I know some PG-13 ads but if you hate the ads then stop playing it.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|What a great series! I had never seen it before, and after watching all 7 seasons am sorry it's over. Warm, funny characters and good writing made this a must-see for me.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|If you are a fan of the original TV series, you will be disappointed with MI 1,2, and 3.  They were a great deal less of \\"Mission Impossible\\" and a great deal more of \\"James Bond.\\"  However, with MI: Ghost Protocol, the original feel of MI is back.  If this is the pattern of the next they could reboot the franchise using this as film one (just toss away the other three or re-name them).
0307730697|5.0|Fearless, is a book that I highly recommend to all ages, male and female. I started Fearless and it was hard to put down. I read it in 3 day. Parents and teachers should make it a must read for all children and students. Brave men and women serve and protect us all in the name of our country and God.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Nothing to really say that already hasn't been said.  This is a really good album, with surprisingly dark and heavy tones at times, but really a variety of creative rock tunes that could have been released 20 years ago by Rush in their (alleged) \\"prime\\".  Really good musicianship, song writing, and lyrics throughout.  Thoroughly impressed!

0345803485|1.0|I got suckered into reading this book after it being highly recommended by my hairstylist. I had avoided this book clearly because of the hype, so saying I had high expectations for this book is an understatement. After the first 3 chapters, I knew I was in trouble.  E.L. James really needs to rethink her choice of profession, because her writing is so atrocious I was screaming at Ana through the whole book. Let's start with a synopsis of the main characters shall we:<br /><br />We have Anastasia Steele, or Ana as she prefers to be called.  Ana is shy, reserved, virginal, and scared of life. Ana has the misfortune of having to interview Christian Gray. Mr. Gray is incredibly hot, with intense Grey eyes and very \\"controlled\\". Get used to the word control, in all it's contexts because that is a word that is strewn about this book like dirty clothes on the floor.  Ana, while interviewing Mr. Grey, thinks to herself what a control freak he is, and he wholeheartedly agrees with her.  Mr. Gray is smitten with young, shy, weak as a doormat and scared of life Ana.  He stalks her, has her phone tracked, and after a friend drunkenly tries to kiss her, he comes to her rescue.  At this point Ana has seen the contracts and the NDA (what kind of freak is this guy) and is still *gasp* (another word you need to get used to) into Mr. Gray.  He finds out that while he suspects she's inexperienced, she is a virgin to boot. So, he deflowers Ana and here proceeds to the most boring and unrealistic sex scenes I've ever read.  Seriously, who writes this stuff. Ana has the uncanny ability to orgasm at not only the command from Mr. Gray to \\"come for me\\", but at any word from him. I've heard of responsive women, but even this is a stretch.  Once she's no longer a virgin, she comes off as having some serious hang-ups about sex. She likes it, but is somehow concerned that she is not enough for our domineering and controlling Mr. Gray.  She is so weak and pathetic I want to slap her silly.<br /><br />We have Christian Gray, who after being exposed to the BDSM lifestyle by Mrs. Lincoln (Mrs. Robinson as Ana calls her), is a complete and total control freak. Anyone who gets themselves involved with him soon discovers this. Christian refers to himself as a Dom, but we see this with a rarity.  He wants Ana to be his sub, but we discover that she can't hang with that, so he takes the \\"vanilla\\" sex.  Speaking of the sex, this is nothing near erotica. This is about as erotic as the Penthouse Forums.  Anyway, Christian wants complete and total control of Ana. He wants to know her every move, tell her when she can and cannot leave, where she can and cannot go. When Ana tries to set him straight, he gets angry with her.  His anger ranges from mad to furious and is often scary to watch. He does not get how Mrs. Lincoln is a molester, and much to Ana's horror, maintains a friendship with her. While he gets jealous if she hangs out with her friend Jose', she is not allowed to have the same courtesy with wanting Christian to stay away from her.  He is abusive, and Ana walks on eggshells with him so as not to make him really angry. This is hard to do because she never knows what is going to set him off.  Personally, I loathed this character so much that I wanted to stomp on his nuts on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Ana finally gets smart and leaves him when he beats her with a belt. She realizes that he enjoyed hurting her, and that was to much for her.  However, she will go back to him in the next book.<br /><br />Again, seriously, who writes this drivel?  I cannot fathom how anyone would find this book to be a love story.  This is more a story about abuse and how much a person can handle.
0345803485|1.0|When another reviewer wrote, \\"Either you love it or hate it,\\" that was a statement that required clarification. You either love it or hate it based upon two things: If you've never read anything BDSM-related before, you might find it entertaining. However, if you've ever read any great work of literature, you may want to find the nearest fireplace. The sex scenes - which we're all really here for - aren't particularly tantalizing or intriguing if you're at all familiar with Jackie Collins. The real crime here is the manner in which the book is written, stylistically speaking, that is beyond the pale. Though we may be reading '50 Shades...' for the sex, it is very difficult not to laugh or even want to cry at the author's amateur writing skills. The word count for the word 'murmur' alone is astronomical (5 times on one page even!). Furthermore, besides Anastasia's character, there isn't a single remotely interesting, much less believable, character. Christian Grey's character, for example, is so unbelievable that no suspension of disbelief is possible. It is also clear that the author did no research whatsoever beyond the sex. Perfectly clear Seattle skylines in May? LOL! There is no plot either unless you consider this meditation on Ana's and Christian's relationship a plot. I'm further blown away by the fact that this is a trilogy. How, one can only wonder. Then again, most of us do take leave to the restroom more than once a day.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is my first experience with Jillian Michaels' workouts and it was tough! There are 3 levels to work up to and I never got past the first one. It's 20 minutes per workout and if it was 22 I think I would pass out. That said, this is a great DVD. She really knows her stuff and talks you through every step of the way explaining what you're doing, what muscles you're working, and shows modifications for an easier or more challenging workout. I recommend this for anyone looking to get an intense workout by themselves at home.

1476712042|5.0|I feel like I have read every amazing book on the planet this year. But this one.. this one tops the list.<br /><br />I was terrified going into Beautiful Disaster. I don't know why I got so worked up over it, but I did. I was scared because Beautiful Disaster seems to be a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" kind of book.. and I so badly wanted to love it. All my worries ended on the very first page. I was totally hooked. I was in love.<br /><br />I barely even know how to describe my reading experience. The physical experience was every bit as valuable as the story. I spent one entire day reading this book in extremely awkward positions (including laying on the floor with my feet up in the air on a chair..weird, I know), I took this book with me to the bathroom because I couldn't possibly part with it, and I quoted every other line to my amazingly tolerant boyfriend. I laughed, I giggled insanely, and most importantly, I cried like a little girl. I think my eyes were in tears the entire last quarter of the book. I went from sad, to desperate, to happy, to insanely happy, and back to sad when the book ended and I had no more amazingness to read.<br /><br />Jamie McGuire is a freakin' genius. I'm usually very picky about my bad boys, but Jamie set up Beautiful Disaster perfectly so that I would fall head over heels for Travis. Normally in stories like this there's the bad boy who acts like a jerk and then there's the nice guy, and I always fall for the nice guy. Not this time! Travis had a great mix of bad boy jerk and sweet, sensitive, affectionate man. That way, when compared to Parker, Parker just looked like the boring, \\"safe\\" option, and Travis looked like the passionate, head over heels, to die for option.<br /><br />I think a lot of people don't like this book because they look at Travis and they see a troubled guy who's too arrogant and objectifies women. That's why I was scared going into this book, because I normally hate that kind of thing. But when I looked at Travis, I saw so much more than that. In the first scene he has a skimpy girl on his lap, but as soon as she insults his friend, he's like \\"Get out. Now.\\" I knew right then and there that I would like Travis. He may have flaws but he is loyal. He's not a jerk all the way through. He loves his friends, he sticks up for them, and he'll go the lengths of the world for them. His relationship with Abby isn't perfect, but my god, it is passionate. I honestly think the title for this book is so perfect, because their relationship was absolutely beautiful.. but it was also a disaster. It was a little dysfunctional, and a little crazy, and there were definitely highs and lows. But that's what made this book an absolute delight of a roller coaster. When things were going badly, I was desperately clinging onto every page, waiting for things to get better again. I rarely get that invested in books, but I literally felt like my life would end if Travis and Abby couldn't make their relationship work.<br /><br />It's important to realize that Beautiful Disaster isn't about a perfect relationship or the perfect boyfriend. It's about working through troubles and differences to hopefully get a better outcome.<br /><br />Even the side characters in Beautiful Disaster were amazing and so full of life! America.. how I LOVED LOVED LOOOVED America! She is like the best friend I never had and always wanted. She's so fiercely loyal and always siding with Abby and always supporting her no matter what. I love how they always run to each others' sides when things get tough.<br /><br />My only `problems' with the book are two small things:<br /><br />The blurb isn't exactly accurate. It says, \\"The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn't drink or swear..\\" Abby isn't as much of a \\"good girl\\" as the blurb implies. It clearly says, \\"She doesn't drink or swear,\\" but Abby actually does drink and she has a fake ID. So if Abby is a \\"good girl\\" who has a fake ID and goes to clubs and drinks, what the heck am I? I don't drink, I never had a fake ID, and I don't go clubbing. I must be the virgin mary! I know that there is a big back story behind this, but I felt like there was never a point in the book where Abby was a good girl. Yes she was trying to start over with a new slate, but she was never ever innocent and never turned down a drink.<br /><br />The other thing isn't really a problem with the book, it's just something that kept making me laugh. Travis always calls Abby \\"Pigeon\\" or \\"Pidge,\\" and I could never keep a straight face. Lady and the Tramp, anyone? The Tramps calls Lady \\"Pidge\\" ALL THE TIME! I just couldn't help but think of those cartoon characters every time Travis said it! I immediately messaged my boyfriend and instructed him NOT to call me Pigeon.<br /><br />I feel like I've barely scratched the surface with this review. This book really shook me to my very core. Do you ever feel silly when you yell at characters in a movie for making a mistake? Because obviously they can't \\"hear\\" you and nothing you say will change the movie. But when I was reading this book I was yelling at the characters and wishing like crazy that things would work out.. despite the fact that obviously my yelling and wishing wouldn't do any good. But that's how much I fell in love with this book and that's how much it affected me. I know my boyfriend will vouch for all the times I pasted him quotes from the book over Skype, and my mom laughed at me for shrieking in delight over the exciting parts and for screaming, \\"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!\\"<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind.. this is the best book I have read this year. Period. This is one of my all time favourite books. I'm so incredibly thrilled that I discovered this book and I have you to thank! I feel sorry for whichever book I read next, because there's just no way it will top this one.eck am I? I don't drink, I never had a fake ID, and I don't go clubbing. I must be the virgin mary!

B008ODZEQ0|4.0|I won't be overly prosaic, or analytical. I'm not one to call this the best documentary ever with witty remarks, or deep commentary. Simply put, I was surprised how entertaining, yet beautiful this documentary really was. It truly offered a peek into the opus of one man, his passion and dedication to his art, and how that singular focus took over his life, family and meaning in life. Remarkable in the calmness of the camerawork--as meditative as Jiro's approach to his craft and just as remarkable beautiful. Never has ten stools looked so lovely.<br /><br />My withholding of one star was only in the overly positive tone. Not that drama should be manufactured, but to further go into the more difficult times of his life would have offered a satisfying counterpoint to the constant chatter of Michelin stars.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the first book I have purchased on my kindle and I had no problems. It downloaded easy and I haven't had any problems reading any of the 3 book series. I love the books too!
0345803485|5.0|I loved the 50 Shades Trilogy.  It's H O T!!!  EL James has a wonderful, fluid writing style that kept me hooked until the final word.  Can't wait for the movie.<br />Laters Baby!
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|King has evolved from the days of 'The Shining' and 'The Stand'.  Less shock horror, but just as much weirdness with a touch of reality thrown in.  You can almost believe this story and I was drawn into it very quickly, and wanted to just keep reading.  Not his best book by his previous writings, but still a darned good read.
B008BIN9EW|2.0|I have played Starcraft, Civilization and several other resource building rts games. In every single game there is some kind of tutorial to guide you the first few levels. The only tutorial is pure text with no illustrations or links to show what they are talking about. Sorry, but call me lazy. I don't want to spend the time figuring out the rules from text. Like I said, I'm lazy, but I think the programmers are no better for not providing a step by step in game guide.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Works perfectly on my HTC One s.  Everything about this game is polished. It's the same thing over and over, but, they really did a great job keeping it interesting and fun. Kudos to half brick, you've done it again!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This program has very clear and simple sounds that mix really well. It's fun to use and save your own sounds!
1573300403|2.0|I am huge fan of Michael Jackson and ordered this set. The songs listed on this DVD are the best songs. But there are no Subtitles and the DVD quality is also not so good as I thought. This is like watching on basic TV channel but at least they have Closed Captions to see what the lyrics are. I wanted to return this DVD but I did not see any other DVD set of Michael Jackson that has subtitles.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Awesum totally awesum awesum totally awesum<br />Go out and buy dis CD its da best one gaga ever put out
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Entertaining and challenging. At times hitting the right boxes is frustrating on my evo and I have to zoom in and out to get more accuracy. It works really well on my kindle fire though. I'm addicted.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Aewsome movie - go Navy and goodbye aliens!  A real tribute to veterans as well.  Must see movie.  Great special effects and human stories of conflict and getting the girl.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love the original version of this game. Just the right amount of challenge and fun to keep me working to figure out the puzzles. I'm so excited that the color version is the FAOTD.
B005PK55BE|5.0|My husband & I can't seem to get enough of this series.  Our fear, every time we really like a series - it gets cancelled...Each episode creates a  dramatic  challenge but moves speedily.  We're hooked!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I'm no kid, but this game is some serious fun!  I'm so glad I decided to download this app.  It's challenging enough to stay interesting, but easy enough to be playable.  I'd like more like this!  Great job, Halfbrick!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|So far the book has been very entertaining.  I'm currently on book 2.  I wish I could go back on my Kindle sometimes to reference maps or look back at characters.  It would be nice if the books were separated on my Kindle as well.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I like the graphics and the level up system. it is a good strategy game. it was also a good deal with the free app of the day.
B004WJRF6C|5.0|I almost didn't buy this disc. I was quite satisfied with the sound on the original disc I bought years ago. But reviews here and from cyber friends made me think twice about it. I bought it.<br /><br />And am I glad I did! The sound quality on this disc far exceeded my expectations immediately. Yes, even \\"The Lovely Linda\\" sounds considerably better. Throughout, the bass is deep and punchy, the guitars lively, and the presence on the vocals is so much nicer. You hear evey instrument in every song distinctly.  No mushing of the sound of combimed instruments.<br /><br />The ample booklet has all of the photos featured with the original album, plus many more. The bonus trax are a mixed bag. \\"Suicide\\" is a full length demo of the snippet featured at the end of \\"Hot As Sun\\". A lot of \\"do-do do-do, do\\" where the lyrics were never finished. But it's still interesting. There's two live versions of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", one from ONE HAND CLAPPING, and the other live at Glascow, from 1979. Both are excellent. Also from the Glascow concert is \\"Every Night\\" and \\"Hot As Sun\\". The latter may seem like an odd choice, but they rock it up pretty good. It features a good guitar solo not featured in the original. \\"Don't Cry, Baby\\" is the instrumental backing track for \\"Oo You\\", without all the over dubs. This possibly before the song became \\"Oo You.\\" \\"Women Kind\\" is a piano demo of a song in defense of women: \\"Women kind. They have a terrible time.\\" But it doesn't get too far, and he ends it making farting noises. Overall, a good bunch of bonus tracks.<br /><br />My one and only complaint is that all of this could have fit onto one disc. But that doesn't stop me from giving it a 5-Star rating.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the fact that I get to pick &amp; choose which sounds I want,  then I decide how loud each sound is. This is a great app &amp; it worked wonders for me. It has made falling asleep so much easier, I recommend it for anyone who has trouble falling asleep.
B002Z58GQS|2.0|Yes, this is a good deal for the money, but this device doesn't last long. I purchased this in January, and just this week the entire drive became corrupted, erasing my files. Buyer beware, I guess.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|works awesomely on kindle fire! so great! I'm so glad they came out with it! does not boot you out while playing. overall, awesome game!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love THE BIBLE  and I think everyone should and if it doesn't work download it again even if it costs money it is worth it because it is called THE BOOK for a reason people. and THE BIBLE more important than anything eltse you can get!!!!!!!!!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I thought that this was an honest and good book. It gives good guidance. Some of the things he mentioned are things that we may know about or things that we may be good at, and other things may be things that we have forgotten or may have never known. I read this book, and I found it useful. He even gives links to his website and twitter, I think. I will read this book again. This is a manual to be utilized and kept and not a book that you should read and throw away.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was a great book I loved every page of it. Cant wait for the movie and I am looking forward to a sequel!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I honestly can't remember a book that gave me as much sheer pleasure as \\"Ready Player One.\\"  (And I have read a lot of genre books.)  RP1 gives you a protagonist with a distinctive voice who exists in a world lovingly recreating most of my best memories from the eighties.  I have no idea how someone who was not a child of the eighties would experience this book, but for me the narrative arc was consistently intriguing, the characters utterly believable and the eighties based environment just plain fun.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read the next book--see you at the Drafthouse!
B0085A9J18|4.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" (An Action/Martial Arts DVD review)...LOVED IT!!    Become a fan of The Lowedown on Facebook:[...]  What's it about?  In the Jakarta slums, a derelict apartment building has become a no-go area - even the police are unwilling to enter. It has become a safe-house for the most dangerous killers and gangsters. A SWAT team infiltrate the building, under the cover of darkness, to remove its owner - a notorious drug lord named Tama.    What did I think?  This was one of the best pure action movies I have seen in a long time.  The fight scenes were so impressive (armed and unarmed), that it has you gripped from start to finish.  If you take \\"Ong Bak\\" and \\"The Expendables\\" then put them in a blender...you get \\"The Raid: Redemption\\".  Stick this one in your player ASAP.
0887307280|5.0|I am a business major concentrating in Entrepreneurship and Business Development.  I plan to go into consulting to help small businesses grow.  This book really hits home for current business owners as well as people wanting to start their own companies.  It is very well written, and the progression is captivating and inspiring.  I highly recommend this read, which was also recommended to me by multiple successful business owners that came to speak at our university for business week.
B008D28HYS|1.0|I refuse to download this version as well.  enough with the data mining ok developers!  call me crazy but I had the original version of this game and once I uninstalled it my phone stopped acting glitch
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app.  I use it on a Motorola DROID2 and DROID4 and on two Nexus 7 tablets.  It performs flawlessly on all four devices.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|looks good and works as it is supposed too. this feature is plenty annoying so I dropped a star from the review.
B006OFN0SE|3.0|I had looked forward to viewing this movie for months but was terrible disappointed in it. Thought Leo was great as J Edgar, but that is all. Overrated!  Happy with Amazon. Really think they are a great company & have never had a problem with them.
0345803485|1.0|I had more fun and laughs reading the reviews than the book.  Don't buy this book; the writing is appalling.

B00005N6KG|5.0|These is the most comfortable headphones I've used, and I've bought and used some very nice ones. I wear glasses and regular headphones become painful after 30-60 minutes. Ear plugs trap moisture in the ear canal and that's uncomfortable after a few hours. While it may seem nothing will make me happy, these headphones do. I've used them for several weeks now, and I'm still happy.<br /><br />Edited March 2015:<br />I bought these March 2015 and love them as much as the MDR-W08L:<br />SONXTRONIC Xdr-8000 Vertical in Ear Ultralight Sport Running Headband Headphones<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QHOCTG6/<br />$25 is fair, quality seems good, them wear the same.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|The second season arrived in great shape and I enjoyed watching it very much.  I ended up completing the entire second season in about 5 days.  I looked forward to coming home from work and watching a couple of episodes each evening.  This is the best way to watch TV.  I love this show.
B008JAG2AA|3.0|This movie was so-so, not as funny as the previous movies. It seems that the makers of this film tried too hard.
0521675804|5.0|Very good book for students who are either learning English (ESL) or for anyone wanting to review essential elements of grammar,  The book is intuitively organized to readily facilitate assimilation of English fundamentals for speaking or writing.  The book's illustrations add interest to the reader.<br /><br />I sent this book to my girlfriend in Thailand so that she may improve her English writing skills.  She really appreciates it and this book has stimulated her interest to improve her English.
B0084RSYEK|4.0|It was a good movie. Eddie Murphy is always funny. Plus, there was a great message that I could take and apply to my own life.

B004XIZN5M|5.0|First - and this is just my $.02 - for those who are questioning if the author was in jail, or if the representation of jail is accurate . . . IMHO the jail thing is a tool to present a set of info and make it informative and motivational.  Same as all the military inspired fitness books.  Just a framing point.<br /><br />This is a great back to basics fitness book.  All you need is a pull up bar and about 6' x 2'.  I really like that of the 'badass' fitness books out (military, fighting, jail) it focuses on a realistic progression for those at any level, which is rare.  It probably errors on the conservative side for progression and frequency of workouts, but that is okay.  I personally think it tends to be more on the MED (minimum effective dose) which is probably a good thing.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|After reading the book in this trilogy, I felt the movie failed to follow some areas of the book in more detail which distract from the movie. It is an excellent movie and plan on seeing the second movie out next year.
B000000W6X|5.0|This is perhaps the most mesmerizing and hypnotic recording ever made, but it is in dire need of a proper remaster to do it justice. The sound quality on this CD (which has been out for more than 15 years) sounds thin, because the technology was not available at the time to create the full, rich sound that is now standard.<br /><br />If anyone is reading this who knows someone who knows someone who can get someone to get the job done, please, pass this message along: a REMASTERED version of this disc is URGENTLY NEEDED!!!

030758836X|2.0|Of about ten or eleven of us gathering to discuss Gone Girl last evening, only one person could actually say that he \\"liked\\" the book and would read another by the same author.  The rest of us tended to have similar reactions:  we didn't think the F word needed to dominate all of the dialogue; there were no characters to actually like or identify with; some of the situations were too incredible; it was a bit too weird to be actually enjoyable reading; why read something where almost all of the characters are in some way dysfunctional or psychotic or neurotic.  We couldn't think of much redeeming about the book but did give the author credit for thinking up such a complicated, carefully crafted plot.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I bought it and it will not download and I'm pretty sure its taking my money and this is the third time ive tried
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the basic calculator that should have come on the Fire. No bells and whistles, perfect for everyday use.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I found the books an interesting read. They were very raunchy, but I have read Mills and Boon and Silouette stories that are as raunchy. If your life is a bit dull or same old same old, you will find these books a great way to distract you from your mundane life but if it is an interesting life you live these books will probably spice up your sex life.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved the 50 shades books! You get drawn in and just have to find out more about Christian. I am so tired of people saying it was written poorly. You don't pick up this book to expect to read a novel written by Ernest Hemingway for crying out loud. And I loved that the author included all the swear words that Ana was thinking, it makes her more real. And it isn't any dirtier than other racy romance novels ... Being spanked and tied up is nothing new ...
034580404X|4.0|Don't listen to anyone else...just read it. There are mixed opinions and feelings about this book, but until you sit down and read it yourself you just won't know for sure. Be prepared ladies!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great. I have it on my phone and Fire. You really have to study the puzzle and think as you progress.

B002TVQ4HG|4.0|Only Hitchcock could have done it better. This has all the twists and turns of a great thriller. It is for people who like to think during their movies, for this is one thought provoking film. There are enough synopses here, but I want to correct a few impressions. It is not a slasher film, but there is blood. More importantly it is about one woman's fight within to do the right thing. The ending is a shock and yet I feel I should have seen it coming. The time went by so quickly and my attention was so completely hooked that when the movie ended I had to take a few minutes to come back to my own life. If you like mindbending thrillers you will love this. If you want slash and gash with no plot watch Freddie again.<br />I am buying it so I can watch it whenever I want to.<br /><br />I have never given a movie a 5, but this deserves a 4.5.
B005R4255C|5.0|I love it!<br />It brought me back to the amazing show by Circ de soleil.<br />Now, I'm waiting for the DVD!

B002MFULQO|4.0|Watched this movie with my girlfriend, who watched it for class.  I was never a \\"conspiracy\\" guy, and I'm not necessarily now (but some things are pretty fishy).<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie, however.  Great cast, very good acting and a very good story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this Kindle Fire.  Even set up wi-fi in my house so I could use it.  Great item for reading books and surfing the net, and perfect size.
0345529057|5.0|The box set contains the first four books of the Song of Ice and Fire Series. The books themselves are so enthralling that i read them all within a month. The characters are so real and subtle. The Game of Thrones HBO series does a wonderful job of bringing these books to life. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B008602KQI|3.0|First of all, Hollywood really needs to rethink endings of films, they seem to {nowadays} like to leave the endings to your imagination, which some people like, I don't, I prefer it left fully concluded, like the series \\"Alien\\", sequels were made, but every movie had a solid ending. Anyway, the movie was decent enough, I could pick it apart, but no need, I'm not a critic, it's worth a watch, just not a blockbuster in my opinion.

Having seen his work constantly rejected, Kennedy Toole fell victim to paranoia and depression, and he committed suicide in 1969. \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" was published in 1980, thanks largely to his mother's persistance - and it went on to win the 1981 Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />The book's central character - I can't honestly call him a hero - is Ignatius J. Reilly. Although well educated, and certainly creative, he barely has a redeeming quality to his name. Ignatius is a self-absorbed, lazy, obnoxious slob, bordering on the pungent, a royal pain in the ass who melodramatically refuses to see the world as it actually is. His diet is nearly as bad as his dress sense, yet his appetite knows no bounds. (For some reason, he never stops to wonder why he has such trouble with his pyloric valve). Ignatius despises modern society; he's a regular at the local cinema, carefully selecting only those films that will cause him the most offense. (He'll loudly proclaim his disgust from one end of the film to the other...and then stay for a repeat viewing, so he can be offended a second time). He lives with his long-suffering mother in New Orleans and has never been further than Baton Rouge. (That trip was naturally a disaster and, if he manages to corner an unsuspecting ear, he'll bore his victim to tears by telling the story time and again). The book's opening sees Ignatius nearly arrested by Angelo Mancuso - a local cop who's constantly on the lookout for a suspicious character. Poor Mancuso couldn't have known what lay ahead - but, having tossed the stone, the ripples start spreading.<br /><br />Thanks to Ignatius, the book probably won't appeal to everyone. However, despite Ignatius being the most cringeworthy character I've encountered in years, I just couldn't abandon the book - there was a morbid curiosity about what sort of a hornet's nest he'd stir up next. Certainly recommended.
0307341550|4.0|I started it late one night, and only stopped because it was 5 a.m., and I had to be somewhere at 9! The author's ability at describing anything, everything, is almost uncanny for a rookie novelist. I could perfectly see every character, smell every scent, feel every emotion she described.The story revolves around a serial killer, but it is the most forgettable part when you reach the end.Brilliant.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but a double whammy of recent outspoken independence regarding the film really clinched it for me. First of all, I love that the DVD isn't the special features-laden 5 disc set everyone obviously hoped it would be. Buy a DVD for the movie. How many making-of featurettes could you possibly need, anyway?! Secondly, the recent snub with the Oscars has just gone to show me that a movie like this doesn't need approval from anyone to still be amazing.

I eagerly await any new publications from this author and in reading his latest novel I was not left disappointed.<br />The book moves at a fast pace and one doesn't like to put it aside as it is both gripping in its intensity.<br />It is good to see that Mr. Baldacci continuously creates new characters. In Innocent he has created Robbie, an assassain who comes across a young teenager. Without giving the plot away they very quickly become embroiled in an intense fast moving story which leaves one hanging on every page.<br />Well written and I recommend to all.

B003Y5H5FG|3.0|Fright Night (2011) is a remake of the [[ASIN:0767817664 1985 classic]] starring Roddy McDowall, Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse. It's the story of a young man with a vampire living next door who recruits a fictitious vampire slayer to rid himself and his friends of the problem.<br /><br />As remakes go, this one if pretty fair, maintaining interest throughout the film for the most part. A-list actor Colin Farrell somehow agreed to play the lead (the vampire) in this B movie and does well with his part. Taking liberal cues from Christian Bale's performance in [[ASIN:B002PA8Q1S American Psycho]], Farrell tries to be horrific, campy and psychological in his role with lots of shifting eye stunts and half-actions. He's fairly believable (as believable as one can be playing a vampire) and generally carries his part well. While probably not as effective as Sarandon from the 1985 version, Farrell nonetheless carries the film.<br /><br />The rest of the cast -- Anton Yelcher as Charlie Brewster, the neighbor; Toni Collette as his mom, Jane; and David Tennant who recreates McDowall's role as the vampire slayer -- are not nearly as good. Yelcher emotes a lot of the time, Collette seems disaffected as mom, and Tennant is way over the top playing a Las Vegas entertainer/vmapire expert. None of the three are particularly gripping in comparison to the 1985 film. Charlie lacks the naivete Ragsdale brought to the part and no actor will ever portray the Vincent character with the self-doubt, charm and camp the late McDowall brought. Also, Chris Sarandon, so effective as the 1985 vampire, plays a small, inconsequential role.<br /><br />With what is typical for horror films in the new century -- too much gore, somewhat disbelievable computer-generated graphics, and action substituting for performance -- there's little question the 2011 version is inferior to the 1985 film. Still, there aren't many vampire movies released these days, even in our copycat epoch, so any new vampire movie is worth seeing for fans of the horror genre. While this movie won't sway the general moviegoer to rent or own it, any horror acolyte should give it a look.new vampire movie is worth seeing for fans of the horror genre.

1423113454|5.0|I've always been fascinated with ancient Egypt, their gods and goddesses, and the mythology surrounding their culture. While I'm not offering any spoilers, I hope you'll sit back and join me in enjoying a fun and entertaining tale.<br /><br />The Red Pyramid starts off with a brother and sister separated by a continent and worlds being brought together by their father when he attempts to correct a mistake he made that cost them their mother. His plans fail and he releases Set and his siblings into the world. As Kane and Sadie struggle to understand what they witnessed, they're forced into a world where the gods are blamed for the fall of Egypt and the remaining magicians are instructed to kill them on sight.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed a good story and The Red Pyramid delivered on that and much more. Despite it being targeted for YA, the book touches on a number of topics that will strike a chord with adults as well as young adults.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|That's Norweigan for wow, what an idea! Clearly inspired by [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]] and its many copycats and knock-offs of moving camera, reality genre, Troll Hunter is a playful and sometimes exciting reality-based film about some Norweigan students making a film that happen to cross paths with a funky guy that happens to be a troll hunter for the Norweigan government.<br /><br />After about 20 wasted minutes -- about the same amount of time it took the students looking for the Blair witch to set the scene for their film -- the three film entrepreneurs find the troll hunter and start following him around. Using hand-held cameras, dark scenery and a narrow frame that created most of the excitement from the moving camera in Blair Witch, these students put on a pretty good show.<br /><br />The Norweigan filmmakers had a large sense of humor, too. Otto Jesperson, playing Hans the troll hunter, steals most of the scenes with his deadpan approach. He is best in scenes where he makes battle with trolls -- once being thrown to the earth by a 15-footer and another time bringing down a 200 foot giant with what appears to be a ginormous camera. Always undaunted, he approaches his adversaries as if half-alive and half-bored. It's a wonderfully campy performance I probably didn't fully digest having to read subtitles all night.<br /><br />The other cast members are some forgettable young adults, one of whom is Muslim. This is important since trolls apparently thirst for the blood of Christians. This works out pretty poorly for one unfortunate member of the cast.<br /><br />A big feather in the cap of these filmmakers for a near complete lack of gore, blood or otherwise disgusting assets, assuming you can live with some goo and what may be for some viewers a pretty smelly substance. I was completely sold for all 103 minutes of this movie with its lack of movie blood and guts, even though there is some troll effluent in one scene.<br /><br />If you've ever wondered what a troll may look like, you'll probably be surprised once you see Troll Hunter. Aside from the obvious borrowings of the modern limited script-movable hand-held camera technique, this movie is probably unlike anything you've seen before. At least the object of horror will be unlike any other. They're actually more laughable than horrifying but they fit both roles well. Kudos for very good animations in good lighting, too.<br /><br />If you have any further questions, my final comment: Gi denne interessante, morsomme og litt klisj&eacute;fylte film en titt for å finne ut selv.<br /><br />That's Norweigan for give this interesting, funny and campy film a look to find out for yourself.ndered what a troll may look like, you'll probably be surprised once you see Troll Hunter.

B007SSEBCU|4.0|She never ceases to amaze me, the depth, the quality of her work. This woman is definitely one of the best, if not the best actor in Hollywood. I liked the film. I also liked the vantage point (from an elderly Thatcher), but I do wish that they would have gotten into a little more of the meat and potatoes of her career. I know that she was maligned, but it was not hard to dislike her, because there was no real reason to like her. There were no real contributions to her society highlighted. We all knew that she was a great Prime Minister because of her long tenure, so it would have been nice to see just why. As it was, the movie made her seem arrogant, insubstantial, mean and with no real depth. It was a beautiful movie, but I do wish that we could have learned a little more about Thatcher and her career instead of feeling, in the end, that she was the old, prudish harpy that the good old boys club warned everyone about.

0345803485|1.0|A few friends and I decided to play a drinking game with 50 Shades of Grey: we took a shot every time Ana 'flushes' or 'blushes'. One of my friends passed out by chapter three.<br /><br />This book is so far beyond terrible I don't understand the hype at all. Flat, obnoxious characters and thin plot aside, the writing itself is awful. It's so repetitive I think it would work better as a parody, with all the flushing and lip-biting and 'oh my's'. (Side note: reading 'oh my' in George Takei's voice makes it *so much better*.) The sheer amount of basic grammatical and punctuational fails alone make me wonder if anyone edited it at all, to say nothing of the total lack of geographical research. As a native of Washington State, it made me cringe -- Pike Market? Really, James? Google. It exists. Use it.<br /><br />As for the characters, Ana has managed to be even more unlikeable than Bella Swan. For all she's supposed to be witty and intelligent, she comes across as neither -- in fact, in some areas her naivete makes her seem uncomfortably close to mentally subnormal. We're told she's 'independent' and 'doesn't do anything she doesn't want to do', yet as soon as she meets Christian, her every thought revolves around him. And don't even get me started on the subconscious/inner goddess crap. I wanted to start hitting her between the eyes with a hammer by chapter two.<br /><br />A lot of people have wondered what Christian could have seen in her, since she's so very insipid, and my theory is that he recognized her as a perfect doormat. He's a smug, snide, totally unlikeable jerk. Hint, Ana: when a guy you've just met takes your drunken self back to his hotel room, strips you half-naked, and sleeps in the same bed with you, RUN AWAY. Seriously, who does that? To say nothing of his (illegal) means of hunting her down to begin with. We're supposed to like this guy WHY? Because we're repeatedly told he's hot? No. Just...no.<br /><br />As for the sex, I've read better fan fiction. A LOT better. This garbage isn't even worth checking out from the library.. A LOT better. This garbage isn't even worth checking out from the library.

1451637500|4.0|The previous ten or so volumes in this series have advanced about one year each in the life of Miles Lord Vorkosigan, from the age of twenty to thirty-two. This time, though, the author jumps ahead seven years after the events of _Diplomatic Immunity_; Miles and Ekaterin now have four kids and Miles has been an Imperial Auditor for a decade, with more than a dozen cases under his belt. (Since Bujold has occasionally departed from strict internal chronology in the past, one hopes she intends to go back at some point and fill in the gap with a few more novels.)<br /><br />This case takes Miles back into the world of cryogenics, of which he has traumatically first-hand experience. The Kibou-daini, the culture of which appears to be largely Old-Earth Japanese in origin, has developed a fixation on cheating death. Freezing the recently deceased or the medically compromised has become routine; many older people even choose to be frozen while they're still healthy. The goal is to be thawed out again at some point in the future when specific terminal diseases have been cured, or when a general rejuvenation treatment has become available. Competition used to be fierce among the world's hundreds of \\"cryocorps,\\" but the industry has consolidated and the half-dozen surviving companies are much more interested in freezing new clients than in thawing the old ones, since they hold the voting proxies of those in the cryochambers. Now one of the largest of the corporations is about to establish a branch in the Barrayaran Empire and Miles has been sent to look into things and make sure all is on the up and up. (He already has reason to suspect it isn't, of course.)<br /><br />Another change from the usual pattern is that much of the story is told from the P.O.V. of eleven-year-old Jin Sato, a runaway and semi-orphan with an intense interest in any form of animal life. At the moment, he's getting by on the roof of an abandoned cryogenic facility, where his menagerie of small animals can be kept corralled. Jin rescues Miles from a kidnapping gone wrong and Miles takes the opportunity to investigate the local society and political situation from the bottom up -- which, naturally, reveals a number of problems and crimes he would not otherwise have known about. Miles being Miles, he undertakes not only to see that the might are brought low, he also rescues Jin's mother, brings his clone-brother, Mark, into the action, and engages in covert ops himself for the first time in years. Miles always knows how to enjoy himself while getting things done.<br /><br />This isn't one of the best in the Vorkosigan series, but it's not bad. Seems a little lightweight and rushed, though, as if Bujold simply had a contract to fulfill with her publisher. But it's still an enjoyable read. However, the narrative ends with a major change in Miles's life, so that subsequent episodes will have to be somewhat different from what went before. I'll be various curious to see how she -- and Miles -- handle things in his new life.an be kept corralled.

B00005JCAA|5.0|I just came back from reading the reviews of people who hated this film. What I learned---again is that there are at least 2 kinds of audience-people. I have seen Ivan The Terrible about seven times a year for the past forty or so years. I see the same opera over and over and over again, playing its recordings before and sometimes after I get home. I reread books, sometimes starting at the beginning directly after finishing.<br />That aside, this film is  made as if the ancient myths of Greece, Rome, Egypt, and so forth, were to have made a comeback and allowed \\"mortals\\" to relate to IMMORTAL ENTITIES. the IMMORTAL ENTITY in this is DEATH. So all the technical questions of why DEATH behaves as he does, have no meaning, since in myth, one must suspend an expectation of reasonable reality. Actually one must do this in accepting a religious belief system.<br />This is a very lush and luscious movie. All the surfaces, the sets, the paintings on the wall, the walls themselves, the vases filled with flowers, the artifacts of life itself are simply spectacular. I have watched it many times and now I look forward to seeing the uncut version with EVEN MORE! After seeing this film, many other films seem flat and without depth and content. All the actors are well chosen. If they were unknowns and not highly awarded and famous, or famous and \\"hot\\", this  makes no difference. But if you already know that three hours is too long, and if you require \\"action\\" and lively stuff with a plot like a well honed detective story, this might not do it for you. I feel in time this will take its place in the gallery of immortal films.

B008Z9YLV2|1.0|This review is for the movie independent of the books, as I haven't read them.  Many of my friends have recommended the books to me, but when you read a book and then watch the movie, it is often disappointing, so therefore, I decided to watch the movie first so as to not be biased.  I was seriously disappointed after all of the hype.  I did not enjoy this movie at all.  I understand that it is a dystopia, so it isn't supposed to have a happy ending, but I didn't feel that it was very well done.  I thought the premise was kind of sick.  You have a group of kids and young adults who are randomly selected to go to slaughter, and everyone acts like they are so lucky.  Then people watch as the kids brutally murder each other, and a bunch of other people sit in a control room playing god and screwing with them for fun. I also didn't really connect with the characters.  I didn't feel like the movie did a good job about making the audience care about them.  The whole relationship between Katniss and Peeta was just awkward, and you are left wondering what happened to the guy back home, who is watching as she develops feeling for this other guy.  I have been told that in the book she is only pretending to fall for him, but the movie doesn't give that feeling.  I also found myself feeling uneasy that the target audience is tweens and young adults, and I'm forced to wonder about people who let their kids watch something so violent, where kids killing kids for sport is portrayed in such a matter of fact kind of way.  I am told that in the books, it gives the feeling that it is wrong, but that didn't translate well to screen.  Over all, I found myself wishing for the movie to be over.  It was not entertaining for me at all.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Sometimes it can be hard to be a writer that flounders around at the lower end of the literary spectrum such as myself.  I like to think I create fairly decent thrillers, chillers and tales of mystery and suspense (such as my latest, a hard-boiled detective novel called \\"Deklan Falls: One Against Many\\").  I have dreams, like many, of writing nothing but books and novels and not spending days behind a desk in an office.  I always feel like I am close to that big breakthrough.  Then, of course, along comes someone like Blake Crouch and I have to wonder just what the hell I am doing.<br /><br />I read Blake's novel RUN just about a year or so ago.  I downloaded it to my Kindle.  I was hooked immediately.  I was literally on the edge of my seat for the entire novel and since I finished reading it, I have recommended it to so many people that I am quite sure most Kindle fans must think Blake is paying me to do so (he isn't).  It is, quite simply, one of the finest thrillers I have read in years.<br /><br />So, it was with great anticipation that I awaited the release of his new novel PINES.  It came out this week and was downloaded to my Kindle Tuesday morning.  I just finished it.<br /><br />Dammit...he's done it again.  Blake Crouch, I mean.<br /><br />This is a novel that doesn't just hit the ground running, it slams into the ground, making it shake violently, and then pummels the hell out of it from the very first page.  It sprints along at a break-neck pace that leaves the reader breathless, always feeling just a little bit behind the story, looking to catch up with each turn of the page or flick of the page button on the Kindle.  And when the story finishes, you, dear reader, will be breathless, exhausted, panting as if you had just run a marathon, but wishing there was more.<br /><br />The novel seems to start off as a standard mystery.  Secret Service Agent Ethan Burke awakens near a river just outside of the small town of Wayward Pines - a tiny hamlet surrounded by towering cliffs and mountains on all sides.  Burke has memories of being in a terrible accident where a Mack truck T-boned his vehicle.  He had been sent to Wayward Pines to investigate the disappearance of two other agents.  His memory is faulty.  He can barely remember his own name and his head hurts.<br /><br />He ends up in the hospital, but something is wrong there.  As he begins to try and start his investigation into the missing agents, the seemingly idyllic town turns openly hostile towards him.  Paranoia sets in for Burke, then outright fear, and the reader goes right along with him.<br /><br />Crouch explored some of these themes in RUN - where the entire world seems to turn against other members of society.  Creepy things begin to happen.  Burke is hopelessly outnumbered, but what is going on in this strange town?  Why do people seem to remember the dates all wrong?  Why can't he make an outgoing phone call?  Why does everything about Wayward Pines seem wrong and are the electrified fences that also encircle the town meant to keep people in, or keep something out?<br /><br />Each page reveals a new twist.  It is nearly impossible to out-guess this brilliantly crafted story - so just go along with it.  It is truly a roller coaster ride with so many twists and turns that you might end up with mental whiplash.<br /><br />Crouch crafts characters that are fully formed, all-too real in your imagination.  So, with each twist and turn your own heart races for them.  You find yourself fully vested in their welfare, which makes the pulse-pounding action and suspense even more nail-biting and intense.  This is a book that not only will keep you on the edge of your seat, but up very late into the night.<br /><br />Crouch is a major talent.  I cannot wait to see what he comes up with next.  He is also a major force in indie publishing, having decided to release RUN last year via Amazon's Kindle platform when other publishers turned it down.  As such, I admire himfor his writing skills and for his willingness to take chances and strike out on his own.<br /><br />PINES will grip you from the first paragraph and will not release you until the end.  That is the most you can ever hope for in a thriller.  It is, without a doubt, one of the best books of the year and one of the best thrillers in years.<br /><br />I just wish Crouch wasn't setting the bar so high.  Those of us jumping for the bottom rung of the ladder have a lot to live up to.<br /><br />Dammit.for his writing skills and for his willingness to take chances and strike out on his own.<br /><br />PINES will grip you from the first paragraph and will not release you until the end.

I guess I Won't Get Fooled Again Who style.<br /><br />And one final note: Ezrin mentions in the liner notes to consider this a face lift.  Well, sometimes these things go wrong and the original product would have been better if it stayed au naturale...just ask Kenny Rogers, Priscilla Presley and Bruce Jenner.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't like this book from the first few pages....but I continued to read to the end..and at the end I was sure I hated this book.<br />Seems by the reviews, I am in the minority...but that's ok.  I feel I wasted my time and money on this book, it was silly and boring.<br />Simply put:  Not my kind of book.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|So boring. Repetitive. You essentially play the same levels over and over from different angles. Game offers little to no challenge.
B0081YBD8A|5.0|I purchased the DVD box set recently to add to my TV/Movie DVD collection. The price for the Series 1 & 2 box set is a bargain. After watching Lip Service through Hulu Plus (Netflix streams it too) I have been recommending it to all my friends, gay and straight. I think it is a well written, produced and performed show.  The characters feel very familiar, like regular folks with common problems/issues such as family, friendship, career, love, trust, betrayal and grief. The series is beautifully filmed with high production values. The romantic love/sex scenes are authentic, daring and tastefully shot. The storyline in both Series One and Series Two ring true and should be viewed in proper order for story continuity and character development. Some people are calling Lip Service the UK L Word but I disagree. Lip Service stands apart with its own unique features. I think it is more edgy and grass roots compared to the slickness and glamour of the Los Angeles L Word. Glasgow, Scotland looks much more fun and hip.  I do hope more people catch this show. It is refreshing, sexy and funny with sad bits as well.<br />Since the DVD's are region 2 format. You will need a multi-region DVD player or if you have a Mac computer, set iDVD to region 2 format viewing. Hope this helps.
014241722X|4.0|I was put off by all of the bad reviews, but finally decided to pick this up as a light summer read. And it was a lot of fun. It has the same tone and basic plot structure of Grisham's other legal fiction (and those are both compliments; he is a good storyteller). I'm not a kid myself, so I can't comment on how well it hits its intended audience of early teen readers, but I sure found it to be a lot of fun. Theo Boone is a likable character who gets embroiled in legal dramas small and large, all before and after school. And like Grisham's other works, it humanizes its characters and raises important issues for reflection even as it entertains (in this book we meet an illegal immigrant who is scared of the police and the legal system). I will certainly encourage my kids to read this one when they get to the right age. Don't be scared off by the nay-sayers.
0345479092|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I've helped other people raise their babies for 5 years and now it's finally my turn to call the shots! I knew basically what works and doesn't work but didn't have a good way to summarize and share it all with my husband. So this book has been great. We may do some things differently but the spirit of this book fits us!<br /><br />Add the fact that we're a military family. My husband is going to be gone for anywhere from 3 days to 9 months at a time. He is so happy to be a daddy and really wants to be involved in raising our child from day 1. We need a reasonably predictable routine when it comes to baby care - not a rigid schedule or a whatever-works-today - because I want my husband to be able to join back in when he returns. I feel like the approach Tracy suggests really is the best for our needs. Because while your baby has needs, you as an individual/parents/family also have needs that require a long view rather than the short view.
B008XM3NZQ|5.0|One of the most influential movies of all time is finally on Blu-Ray and the results are staggering. This specific digibook of Jaws was released originally by Best Buy and quickly sold out nation-wide, making this version a must own for any Jaws enthusiast. The timeless film has been restored from the original prints for perfect picture and sound under the supervision of director Steven Spielberg. Presented in 1080pi HD and a brand new 7.1 audio, the film has never looked or sounded as good as this. Comes with a great selection of extras including The Making of Jaws, and the highly anticipated The Shark Is Still Working. 5-Star treatment to a 5-Star Classic! Highly recommended!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app puts my kids to sleep in five minutes flat.......we have fun picking different combinations of sounds every night. Extremely relaxing........we love it:)  The rain sounds are very lifelike!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|My son loves this game.  You play a match 3 game (like bejewled) to earn money in order to purchase fish and items for your fishtank.<br />You are able to create different profiles so each of my sons will be able to have their on tank.  BIG PLUS in my opinion for doing that.<br />This app was free but it would be worth paying $1 for it.  My son REALLY likes it.
B007SGM084|5.0|great purchase. brought the fifty shades of gray trilogy and it was great. when I purchased it, it downloaded directly to my kindle.  I will surely buy more ebooks from amazon.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I downloaded the original when it was available as the FAoTD and was pleasantly surprised to see a dev that had the guts to host another faotd. There are no permissions for it to access my contacts, sd card, sms or any data other than information I voluntarily give them if I chose to sign up for ScoreLoop. I can only wish that more devs would include the ability to import your game progress from one device to the other as easily as this app allows.
B00008DDSC|5.0|great movie, its one of my top 5 favs. i have a strange taste in movies. its sexy and exciting to watch. makes me wants to eat peas lol.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Horriible horrific and stingy this was a waste of my time and a waste of youtubes videos!!!!!!! NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This is a great movie with an excellent cast. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zoeey Deschanel were perfect. This is not a love story. Its a story about love (an actual quote from the movie). This movie has its hilarious moments and those moments you can really relate to. What I like about it most is how bitingly realistic it is.
B0083EM24C|3.0|I loved Passion Pit's first album, Manners. LOVED it. It only took one listen for me to love every song. After a while, though, I forced myself to pull away from it to check out this album which has been receiving rave reviews from nearly everywhere. It's just disappointing, that's all.<br /><br />This album isn't BAD. It just pales in comparison to Manners..in my opinion, anyway. Not nearly as many hooks, better production but sometimes it's overkill, sound that makes room for fresher hooks that don't ever arrive. I don't know. It's not the mood of the album that's putting me off, it's the songs. People are bloody RAVING for this CD and I just don't see what all the fuss is about. It's not that great. There are some highlights, though: \\"Mirrored Sea\\" blew me away, \\"Carried Away\\" is undeniably catchy, \\"Constant Conversations\\" does live up to the hype, and \\"I'll be Alright\\" is a good listen if you can handle all the bleeps and such. The little \\"Two Veils to Hide My Face\\" song is also worth checking out!
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Highly recommend this book to all ages. It's thrilling and the story gets better with each book. Would read it more than once.
B005J4TLQG|3.0|I bought this movie solely on the hype it had gotten on various movie websites. My hopes were pretty high, but ultimately I was a bit disappointed with the film. Let me start with the positives.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The direction and cinemtography are spot on, this is a very well made film.<br />-The creature design is great, it utilizes the CGI pretty well.<br />-The action sequences are entertaining and well shot.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The main characters are thugs, I hated them right off the bat. Though they do become a bit more likable as the film chugs along, but not by much.<br /><br />Like I said, it hits more than it misses. This movie would be great if the kids were more likeable, (Comparisons to this gang being like the Goonies is laughable.) but as it is I want to slap all of them and tell them to quit acting the fool.<br /><br />The pacing and direction; however, more than make up for this, and ultimately there is fun to be had while watching this movie. I'd say give it a rental before buying.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Great set of movies. Includes the awkward CG additions which stick out like a sore thumb, but a fantastic set nonetheless.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is by far the best book I have ever read,it is so good it will keep you from anything else that is not important you will not even want to eat lol highly recommend it.
B0053O89WY|3.0|I'm still a fan but the show is going downhill. Penny has become intolerably obnoxious. Amy is nauseating and unrealistic with her \\"crush\\" on Penny. Leonard was much better with Priya than with Penny. I wish they would find him a suitable partner. He does not belong with insufferable air head Penny. All that said there are still some very funny episodes. I'm still watching but hoping the sixth season will be better than the fifth.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|wish you could tilt it but hi be fish you his could do I'm saw hug bug Jim juggle wish
B0086700CM|1.0|crashed my moms phone. I am affraid it will crash my kindle fire. DON' GET IT you will regret it.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I watched this in theaters, before I had read the books, and really enjoyed it.  The acting is all done extremely well and it is a very interesting story line.  The costumes and makeup were done excellently!  It definitely made me want to watch the sequel.  However, I didn't like how blurry the fighting scenes were - though I understand it allowed younger people to go watch it.<br /><br />I read the book the following summer (actually, all three books) and then watched the movie again when it came out on video.  I have to say, this was an excellent adaptation from the book!  The only really big difference I saw was that in the book, Peeta looses his leg and gets a robotic one or something.  It really wasn't that big of a deal since it wasn't mentioned much later in the series.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this movie to people.  I liked it better than the books in some parts.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Another one of my favorite bands. I love the cd and would recommend it to anyone! Also, I am so proud of the drummer. He is from a very small town where I lived when I was little.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|The movie arrived in the mail surprisingly fast, my only problem is I keep watching it everyday at 6:am (just kidding)<br />The movie was brand new as advertised and would definitely buy again from the same vendor.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|My husband bought this for me since I love all the movies. I cant pick one song off of it that is my favorite because they are all good. I would definately recommend it.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The negative reviews here are totally off the mark.  First, there's not a huge difference in quality between this book and the earlier books.  It's the same author, writing about the same characters, in the same settings.  People seem to be putting the first three books on a pedestal and throwing this one on the dung heap, and it doesn't make sense to me.  Take this book for what it is, and this series for what it is: entertainment.  Don't expect to find the answer to the meaning of the life, the universe, and everything.  The stylistic differences between book three and book four are little and less and these negative reviews here on Amazon are a mummer's farce.  Okay, look, if you hate those types of phrases then don't read the series at all.  These phrases are used often, and they can be grating, but they're fully present and accounted for in the earlier books.  These phrases and the other archaisms increase the dark-ages atmosphere.<br /><br />Is the action less in book 4 than in books 2 or 3?  Book 4 is more filled with quests than battles, but they're interesting quests that result in significant character development.  Far from agreeing that \\"nothing happens,\\" in my opinion momentous developments occur.  Look, where's Cersei at the end of this one?  Where's Jamie?  Where's Caitlyn, Sansa, Arya, etc.?  Big stuff is going on here.  If you enjoy this series, don't miss this book.  Unrealistic expectations for Nirvana won't be met, but it's a good book that's both engrossing and entertaining.  Thumb's up.<br /><br />Incidentally, the answer is 42.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|At the request of several of my friends, and after finding out the book is being made into a movie with that short little Scientologist guy with amazing hair playing the role of a 6'6\\" blonde monster, I decided to break my reading fast and bought Killing Floor.<br /><br />\\"You'll *love* it,\\" they said. \\"It's *so freaking AWESOME. Jack Reacher *rules*.\\"<br /><br />No, he doesn't. Not by a long shot.<br /><br />This book is awful. The writing style is somehow less sophisticated than Dan Brown's, and the lapses in plot logic are so preposterous you'll need to wear a tinfoil hat to make it halfway.<br /><br />My friends are idiots and I am going to see if they can be placed in the city zoo. The tinfoil hat is off, and if I had a physical copy of this turkey I'd rip off the cover, tape the pages end-to-end, and put them on a toilet roll dispenser.<br /><br />BUT WAIT! You love this book you say? Well, then:<br /><br />- you must. Love really. Short and fragmented.  Sentences.<br />- you think that after. Being jailed. The cops want your crime solving. Skills.<br />- you aren't bothered. By having an. Identical twin. Which is not. In any way. A total MacGuffin.<br /><br />Go ahead, enjoy it and keep on readin' because apparently this has been serialized like some kind of infection that just won't clear up. Crack open that Miller High Life, put your dogs up a spell, and let ol' Jack Reacher do your thinkin' for ya!<br /><br />And if you want to gush about it, go find my friends in the primate exhibit.

0374203032|2.0|At most, this is a timid and vapid discourse on morality in the 21st century.  At best, it is a collection of anecdotes about the distasteful intrusion of Madison Avenue into everyday life.  Anyone who has been awake for the last 30+ years was neither informed nor energized to action by the author's recounting of the horrors of greed.  Mr. Sandel, if this is the best you can do, then you are part of the problem, not part of the solution.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I enjoy playing this game on my Kindle Fire. It is a great spin on Where's My Water. Thanks! :))
B0018AO8TA|4.0|While this album may not represent what most people think of when they think of the Grateful Dead, the album just rocks! One of the things I love most about this album is the way you can still hear the flaws. Missed notes, buzzing strings, imperfect vocals and all, this album is still a testament to not only one of the greatest American bands in their infancy but also a window to early days of record a rock record. There is something so pure and real about the sound of this album that modern digital perfection just can't match.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|I read the first book because of the hype everyone was giving this book.  After I read the first book, I had realized at the end that there was nothing exciting about it.  There was no plot, no action, all it was-was three books worth of fisting, butt plugging, sadistic sex, and a girl madly in love with this guy, but that is it.  I tried giving it an opportunity and read the second and third in hopes that it will get better, but to no avail.  After I finished the third book, it was no different then the first and second, just sex, sex and more sex, nothing else.  Don't waste your time and money on this book if you are looking for action, adventure, even romance.  Its simply porn in a book and that is it.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This little book is helpful in many ways on formatting, and makes it clear that using the space bar and tabs does not make for a well formatted non-fiction manuscript.<br /><br />What isn't made clear is how to format for fiction. And this may be part of the problem with fiction writers who format their stories as though they have written a non-fiction book or an online article - which is why this review is formatted the way it is: it's not a story.<br /><br />Fiction ebooks do not have space between every paragraph, and the DO have an indent at the beginning of each paragraph, unless it's the first line of a chapter, or the first line of a new section: in which case there is also a space after the last line of the last paragraph, exactly the same as in a traditionally published paperback book.<br /><br />Correct fiction formatting lets readers know when a change in time or setting has taken place, and makes reading as pleasurable as when reading a traditional book. But when there's a space between every paragraph, all the way through, it can be confusing as well as annoying to read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard all the hype about these books and I was sooooo not interested. Reluctantly I found myself at the bookstore purchasing 50 Shades. After about 50 pages I was sucked into it. I really enjoyed it. It won't be winning any Pulitzer's anytime soon but its definitely entertaining. I enjoyed books 2 and 3 better but I'm a huge fan nonetheless. If you're expecting to read a Pride and Prejudice like classic....stay clear,  this isn't one but if you're for something to read while the kids are asleep with a glass of wine then its perfect for you. James isn't the best writer due to her repetition and un -unique character development but she is an entertaining one. Christian is one of my new favorite literary characters. I feel like I'm in their world as I read. I reccomend all 3.

B007SO31BQ|5.0|formula 1 fan or not, this movie will pull at your heart. it follows Ayrton Senna through his formula 1 racing career til his death in 1994. my cousin and friend whom have never heard or seen formula 1 loved it. it gives you such an insight into senna that shows this man's true racing spirit and talent. it also shows the political side of formula 1 that unfortunately still goes on til this day in the sport. this is a very very good documentary.. the ONLY issue i have is it makes Prost look almost like villain type of character when anyone who watched the season during that time knows that he was also a fantastic driver and was simply like everyone else. again. formula 1 fan or not, this is a great movie..

B008GOAFBQ|3.0|It is cool to see this CD get some kind of treatment after all these years. Granted, there is not a heck of a lot to hold your hopes on. The remix is not bad, but it does take away a lot of the mysticism and allure from the original. The Original version was kind of dark and had a muddy sound that was really different for its time. When I was a kid i would stare at the cover all day and just listen in awe to the darker vibe of Kiss. Very, very different from the straight, clean sounding 'Dressed to Kill' which was their prior studio effort. These songs were longer, more adventurous and the album as a whole had a great flow to it. A lot of that (in fact most of that) can be attributed to Bob Ezrin and his more artistic approach to producing. The layers he created, the effects, the orchestration and slower songs all made this album the perfect showcase to go with the bands image and show. What an album for its time. A true classic.<br /><br />Then there is this. It isnt over the top different, but just enough to make it slide more to the 'rock' style of Kiss. Some of that darkness is lost a little but it really doesn't do it much harm either. I still would prefer the Original version easily over this. BUT be forewarned that myself and most others writing negative stuff grew up on this album. We worshiped it. Knew all the words to all the songs, had posters on our walls and this album was the reason for that. We probably have all heard this 1000+ times. So a bias is definitely there. Why change a masterpiece that holds so many memories? Well, really, after 35 years why not.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment is that it didnt go a little further with content. As with many others, we have probably all bought this album 15 times since 76 on 4 different formats, so adding some unique and unheard tracks or takes would have been nice. They know all the diehards will buy it anyway but we hate just completing our collections. We want, and deserve a bit more than this after so many years. It fact, this just feels like they are sticking their toes in the water. Surely a double CD, Limited, w/DVD would have been more of a celebration of this classic, than this single CD w/o even a bonus track. A previous song with a different solo hardly gets the heart beating for diehards. There is plenty of space on the CD that could have been used and made us feel a little better about the whole thing. Face it, not many new fans are coming to the table at this point and most will buy the original. For us, who spend another 10 bucks on a CD we have heard 1000 times, its light. Plus, that hiccup before 'Sweet Pain', as others stated, is inexcusable. Major oversight.<br /><br />I do, however, believe that the booklet and notes by Ezrin are nice, and I do believe blowing the dust of this classic doesn't hurt as a teaser for the new CD coming out in the fall. Ezrin deserves another paycheck from this CD as he made it great to begin with. He did not ruin this by any means and in fact, some of the tracks do have an element of added energy from the boost in technology. I just still have to stay true to the original.<br /><br />Hey, at least its not another best of. It has its qualities and isn't a terrible reissue. It just is not essential and not a proper homage to such a classic release.o many years. It fact, this just feels like they are sticking their toes in the water.

B00701L5XS|5.0|I used to pass time when I worked offshore by tying knots. I worked from photo copies and other people. This app has most of the knots I learned and the 3d format makes it easier to see &quot;behind&quot; complicated knots. I highly recommend it.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Overall, this story is about a terrible, obsessive relationship. I hope no young woman reads this and thinks this is love. And why does every heroine have to be so virtuous? It's As if a non-virgin isn't worthy of a good man. Let's not even get into the fact that she throws her virginity away to try to rid herself of him. By the way, Travis needs some major therapy. His jealousy and rage was sickening and not romantic at all!<br />Why did the author pick such awful, random names? I can see 1 character with a unique one but almost every one did. It reminded me of the stories I wrote in grade school where everyone had a \\"cool\\" name. Give me a break.<br />So all that aside (and my ability to seperate fact from fiction and not live my life influenced by these things), I couldn't put the book down. But It was like watching a train wreck. I didnt think Travis was sexy, Abby was boring, America was fickle and a terrible friend, Parker was a tool, Finch was a token gay friend. The author should change the title to Entertaining Disaster because that's exactly what this book is. I pray no young women read this book and are influenced by it.<br /><br />Ps. Married at 19???? Come on!!!! This author is lazy! Lame!
B007H7XJD4|5.0|Sort of a combination of 300 and Clash of the Titans. As others have said, Micky ROurk steals the show with his character.  This movie has some of the best fight scenes ever put together (live action and CGI mixed).  Great music.  A totally fun experience. Loved it.
B007R41E8O|3.0|The game itself isn't bad...once I downloaded the initial game it took a day and a half to download whatever it needed to be able to work on my Kindle Fire. Frustrating!! Once I was able to play it was good except for the ending...that sucked! Sure I solved it, but there wasn't much buy way of explination.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|That's what this movie is about and that's what you can expect. Except for the middle part of the movie where they actually go into telling a story. (This is the part where my husband lost interest). This is a really enjoyable movie, you get action, suspense, and a pretty good story. Check realism at the door of course.
B000ID37SQ|1.0|I tried to watch this movie.  Even overlooked the ever present and over used \\"F\\"  word.  What I could not overlook was the terrible acting and accent of Al Pacino.  Turned it off after about 45 minutes.  Sorry.  Just do not see how this could ever rate 5 stars.

I see death, if not every day, then five out of the seven days of a week.  It is never commonplace, or run-of-the-mill.  Everyone I see who struggles with the end of life is precious and unique.  And why not?  They are our fellow humans, part of the multi-colored weave of the cloth of our species.<br />Not too long ago, I attended a conference that had the dubious honor of being addressed by the smug and self-satisfied chaplain of the Senate of the United States.  (His topic, perversely enough, was on the value of pain.  No one but a theist devoted to a death-obsessed religion could even consider such a perverse topic; but there it was, complete with the usual proof-texts that impoverished money-changers roll out to comfort the disaffected, and esnure the collection plate stays comfortably cushioned.)  Now, it being a matter of historical record that the so-called Father of the United States Constitution, James Madison, thought it was a violation of the very first article of the Bill of Rights for chaplains to be employed by the US military, let alone the US Senate, I found the prospect of listening to one so employed, for a salary sure to be far above that of most of his audience and with such manifestly poor results, rather paradoxical.  Nonetheless, if for nothing but the continuing education credits, I stayed put.  And soon enough heard that canard which most atheists, including myself, find not only so goddamned offensive, but an unwitting witness to the poverty of religious belief itself:<br />THERE ARE NO ATHEISTS IN FOXHOLES.<br />This statement gives the game away: that is, every religion of which I am aware (I exclude Buddhism on the grounds that it is, properly, more philosophy than religion) relies, in the final analysis, on the fear and terror: the threat of hell, eternal torture or loss, as its ultimate ace-in-the-hole.  The ignorant fool (and I have heard more than one person trot forth this overworn, inaccurate and ill-fated witticism) who threw out this slander upon the unwashed ranks of the heathen betrayed more than he knew, or, I dare say, cared to consider.<br />It is not for nothing that Hitch recalls, when he sees the crucifix upon the wall of his hospital room, how in the days of the Inquisition the torturers would hold up the cross before the eyes of the condemned victim, smoldering at the stake, in the hope that they would at the very last recant and die, if not whole, at least as ashes of one destined for eternal life at the throne of the god in whose name humans were put to the rack, the flame, the trial by water and worse.<br />In truth, there are plenty of atheists in foxholes; but I have yet to know of one at, say, a cross burning of the Ku Klux Klan. Or trying to foist their very idiosyncratic brand of sexual morality upon an entire nation. We tend to mind our own lives, and wish only that the less secure would mind their own damned business and leave the rest of us alone. Death, while sad and even tragic, is not an excuse for us to surrender our humanity, our truth, and our reason.<br />And this, really, is the point of Hitch's final (and it is truly saddening to speculate that that is indeed the proper word) book.<br />When, in 2010, the nation's and perhaps the world's foremost atheist (only the great Richard Dawkins could then vie for the honor) was diagnosed with what was in all likelihood a terminal case of cancer, people who cared about such things took notice.  The righteous wondered whether the near prospect of the Big Sleep would bring Hitch around, perhaps to join in total surrender that which he had already allied himself with in the foreign policy of the American neoconservative junto, in the name of fighting whatever wars were to be found in the Near East for  Freedom, Democracy, and against the Axis of Evil.  Or, at the very least, Hitch would come to Jesus, admit he was a miserable sinner, and follow the Roman Road to Redemption, Salvation, and, finally... Bliss.  At the minimum, Hitch would embrace the cynical logic of Pascal and, betting that he had nothing to lose but possibly everything to gain by bowing to worship the god who bade Abraham to murder his son as a sign of -- what was it -- faith? would at the end become the most treasured of religion's adherants: the sinner who has, if not seen the light, at least been so frightened of the fiery glow that he would traduce his very intelligence and, finally, recant.<br />But those of us who had followed Hitch's career for a while, and for whom he was our foremost guiding light in defense of Reason, the life of the mind, and the more-than-occasional bottle of scotch, knew better.  Our hero (he would eschew that term, saying that he had none, and that if he did, George Orwell would be the closest he could come to naming one; I have no such quibbles) would prove that his life was not a charade, but rather the articulate expression of a lover of the very things we held -- hold -- most dear.  This was a man who, upon becoming a US citizen, thus aligning his fate with those of us born to this proud estate and attacked on 9/11 by people who hated everything for which we stand, swore his oath of allegiance to our land at the Jefferson Memorial, clutching in his left hand a copy of Jefferson's Virginia Declaration of Religious Freedom.<br />So this small volume is, and promises to be, a memoir of the journey of that great and good man towards nothingness.  It is a companion to hold and to which we who have concluded that Nothing lies beyond the final veil can recur again and again, for companionship, sustainance and, yes, comfort.<br />For in the final analysis, what truly matters -- what is our final legacy --is that we go forth into that good night as women and men of integrity, true to what we have been, hopeful that our lives on this small planet have made a difference, however small and, in the life of our galaxy, however temporary; and content in the knowledge that our lives, however truncated thay may be, must not be measured in the drama of our exit so much as in the brilliance of our noonday sun.  This little book demonstrates that truth for our dear and beloved Hitch so very , very well.
B0070NSPCU|1.0|I can see that most reviews on this book are very passionate. Having read only half of it before giving up I should be humble towards those who enjoyed reading the novel.  In fact, I can't even claim to write a review in its proper sense.<br /><br />But my aim is not to provoke the books many fans, but to give a little heads up that not everybody share their enthusiasm.<br />There are certainly some qualities to the book. It's a page turner, that is to say it does not unnecessarily  dwell on descriptions and inner monologue, the plot and the character are intelligently build up - at least in the beginning, and wow, what a beginning!<br /><br />But, unfortunately, as the main character, the renowned Vaelin Al Sorna, starts to obtain those hard earned fighter skills, as his inner motivations and demons - if you like - are established and the hard boiled action starts to roll, the story flattens, in my opinion.<br /><br />It to feels too much like the one sided and exaggerated praise you find in a heroic poem of the 12th century and too little like a modern novel in the fantasy genre.<br />Because I already have read The Song of Roland, I moved on. There are so many good novels in the genre - and I so no reason to continue.<br /><br />So of course, if the story someway catches up in the second half - I wouldn't know.  But I had already lost interest in the character and it would be too late for me anyway.
B005LAJ212|4.0|There is no dramatic substance to this series, but it is lively and entertaining.  Emily VanCamp is quite lovely, and Madeleine Stowe looks amazing in her mid-fifties.  I look forward to Season 2.  But why is this show not available on Bluray?  The settings are visually impressive and the girls are hot(and I suppose the guys are too, to many ladies).  I would pay for a Bluray set if one were released, to see all of these good-looking people and mansions and sailing ships in full glory.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|My lifeproof case didn't come in until late. It came a week after the expected date. I got it and then I tested it underwater and it was broken. It was supposed to be brand new. But it looked used. I asked for my money back or a new case but amazon told me the account was suspended due to poor reviews and that I might get my money back after a long investigation. It completely sucks. I wasted $54 on a broken used case.

0345345061|5.0|Tolkien's passion for the deep roots of the English language led him to weave a skein of story-telling that enthrall us. The book begins with his translation of an ancient fragment of an epic poem, \\"The Battle of Malden,\\" about a real 10th battle between the English, led by Beorhtnoth of Essex, and Viking invaders. \\"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelms' Son\\" is followed by an essay on the nature of heroism. The words bang up against one another in painfully exquisite poetry: \\"Aye, a bump on the bone is bad for dreams, and it's cold waking\\" (Tolkien 1966:19), is due to Tolkien's fine craft as philologist and myth-maker. Another sample (1966:19):<br /><br />\\"Thus ages pass, and men after men . . .<br />So the world passes;<br />day follows day, and the dust gathers,<br />his tomb crumbles, as time gnaws it,<br />and his kith and kindred out of ken dwindle.<br />So men flicker in the mirk and goes out.<br />The world withers and the wind rises;<br />the candles are quenched. Cold falls the night.\\"<br /><br />The love of story-telling, what Tolkien calls the \\"Cauldron of Story,\\" is a gift. As a child, I soaked-up vivid renderings of unabridged Brother's Grimm, every juicy ounce of gruesomeness savored. \\"Without the stew and the bones - which children are now too often spared in mollified versions of Grimm - that vision [of distance and a great abyss of time] would have been lost. I do not think I was harmed by the horror in the fairytale setting, out of whatever dark beliefs and practices of the past it may have come. Such stories . . . open a door on Other Time, and if we pass through, though only for a moment, we stand outside our own time, outside Time itself, maybe\\" (56).<br /><br />\\"I feel strongly the fascination of the desire to unravel the intricately knotted and ramified history of the branches on the Tree of Tales . . . It is now beyond all skill but that of the elves to unravel it\\" (Tolkien 1966:46-47). For a delicious immersion into the world of imagination, made visual, see the art of Arthur Rackham. To explore the \\"Perilous Realm\\" of the story, this small book is a pleasure; I highly recommend Tolkien's lyrical, academic essay \\"On Fairy Stories,\\" in the section \\"Tree and Leaf.\\" Even the introduction to this section delights. Following the essay, his classic fable \\"Leaf by Niggle\\" is interrelated \\"by the symbols of Tree and Leaf,\\" both touch on Tolkien's creative concept of sub-creation (Tolkien 1966:31). Tolkien was a creator who believed in, as he put it, the \\"True Myth.\\" I highly recommend the superb study, written Humphrey Carpenter [[ASIN:0618057021 J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]], and [[ASIN:0618056998 The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]], edited by Carpenter. I also suggest T. A. Shippey's excellent books: [[ASIN:0618257594 J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century]] and [[ASIN:B0083W74X8 The Road to Middle-Earth: How J.R.R. Tolkien Created a New Mythology]], among his extensive works on Tolkien.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"On Fairy Stories,\\" explores his love of the genre, myth and folklore, sub-creation, imagination, art, and fantasy. He describes how Art is \\"the operative link between Imagination and the final result, Sub-creation\\" (68). For him, the imaginative world of the \\"fantastic,\\" the art of creating believable images not of the primary world, \\"is virtue, not a vice. Fantasy (in this sense) is,  I think, not a lower but a higher form of Art, indeed the most nearly pure form, and so (when achieved) the most potent (69). He declares that, \\"Fantasy, of course, starts out with an advantage: arresting strangeness. But that advantage has been turned against it, and has contributed to its disrepute. Many people dislike . . . any meddling with the Primary World, or such small glimpses of it as are familiar to them [pretentious rationalists, confined to their narrow view]. They, therefore, stupidly and even maliciously confound Fantasy with Dreaming, in which there is no Art; and with mental disorders, in which there is not even control: with delusion and hallucination\\" (69).<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien referred to himself as a Large Hobbit, he also had deep Catholic faith; his mother's life was shortened by the cruel privations after her family rejected her conversion. She was inspired by Cardinal John Henry Newman; after she died, young Tolkien and his brother found refuge at Newman's Birmingham Oratory. Early on, Tolkien found richness in mythologies and the world of faerie, and in his faith. The following words of encouragement to artists, writers, musicians, and architects are written as if the author had read Tolkien's treatises on the creative impulse. \\"Art must make perceptible . . . the world of the spirit, of the invisible . . . Art has a unique capacity to take one or other facet of the message and translate it into colors, shapes and sounds which nourish the intuition of those who look and listen. It does so without emptying the message itself of its transcendent value and aura of mystery.\\" Also, \\"Every genuine artistic intuition goes beyond what the senses perceive and, reaching beneath reality's surface, strives to interpret its hidden mystery. The intuition itself springs from the depths of the human soul, where the desire to give meaning to one's own life is joined by the fleeting vision of beauty and of the mysterious unity of things . . . what they manage to express in their . . . creating is no more than a glimmer of the splendor which flared for a moment before the eyes of their spirit.\\" And, \\"the intimate reality of things is always `beyond' the powers of human perception.\\" From the \\"Letter to Artists\\" (JPII:1999), whose essence explores Tolkien's description of sub-creation.<br /><br />Those with artistic ability, and a love of writing and reading, may especially appreciate Tolkien's modest protagonist in \\"Leaf by Niggle.\\" The story was born of a piece, when Tolkien woke one morning with it already complete in his mind. In the introduction to the book's section \\"Tree and Leaf,\\" he describes how the story was inspired by the beauty of a \\"great-limbed poplar tree that I could see even lying in bed. It was suddenly lopped and mutilated by its owner, I do not know why. It is cut down now, a barbarous punishment for any crimes it may have been accused of, such as being large and alive. I do not think it had any friends, or any mourners, except for myself and a pair of owls\\" (31-32).<br /><br />As to the story: in another realm, Niggle's old neighbor, Parish, is guided by a man towards some distant mountains. Along the way, Parish is astonished to see a gorgeous, somewhat familiar looking tree flourishing in divine light . . .<br /><br />\\"Did you think all this, Niggle? I never knew you were so clever. Why didn't you tell me?\\"<br />\\"He tried to tell you long ago,\\" said the man; \\"but you would not look. He only got canvas and paint in those days, and you wanted to mend your roof with them [Niggle's paintings]. This is what you and your wife used to call Niggle's Nonsense, or That Daubing.\\"<br />\\"But it did not look like this then, not real,\\" said Parish.<br />\\"No, it was only a glimpse then,\\" said the man; \\"but you might have caught the glimpse, if you had ever thought it worth while to try.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, what is left of Niggle's portrait of his tree crumbles, \\"but one beautiful leaf remained intact. Atkins had it framed. Later he left it to the town museum, and for a long while 'Leaf: by Niggle' hung there in a recess, and was noticed by a few eyes. But eventually the Museum was burnt down, and the leaf, and Niggle, were entirely forgotten in his old country\\" (119-120). But, in his new country, Niggle's beautiful landscape proves refreshing and restorative for many soul.<br /><br />You also won't want to miss the section with \\"Verses from the Red Book,\\" with the original, delightful illustrations by Pauline Baynes, and alliterative treats such as \\"The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late.\\" The little dog laughed . ..tion \\"Tree and Leaf,\\" he describes how the story was inspired by the beauty of a \\"great-limbed poplar tree that I could see even lying in bed.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I really loved this book. Definitely one of the best I've read this year, probably one of my favorites ever.  There were some grammar and minor continuity issues, but nothing that really bothered me.  But now the hard part comes, waiting for the next book.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The book starts off all over the place but draws you in regardless. I have found my self recommending the book to several other people, which I never do.  The author paints a world that is captivating and magical, and makes you wish you could wander the circus.  It is definitely a must read!
B001DU8T6S|3.0|As a big fan of Queen for many many years, I certainly awaited the release of this studio album with much impatience. Queen's last studio album Made in Heaven really blew me away. Made in Heaven is their one of the best in my list, so I expected nice surprises with Cosmos. With Paul Rogers joined in as a lead vocalist, it is hard not to think that he is trying to take over Freddie Mercury's spot. Paul is a guest vocalist, I know, but still, listening to a Queen album with some new voice is strange. I can't help not to compare it to Queen's albums with Freddie's vocals. Maybe not a fair comparison, but then again I can't help it.<br /><br />Cosmos Rocks is a fair album. It sounds more like a Brian May solo album, though. C-lebrity is not a dissapointing track, but the rest may fall between good and fair. It's not a bad album, I just expected it to be more.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|All I can say is read this book if you want to be drawn into a book and its characters. Abby and Travis's friendship/relationship and the road they travel together the ups and downs just a wonderful written book! Loved it!
B008D28HYS|4.0|I went ahead and downloaded, despite the hoopla over all the permissions required.  It's a great game, especially if you are a Sudoku fan.  I had never played this particular &quot;version&quot; before, but figured it out easily after the first couple of puzzles.<br /><br />It does seem to be a bit buggy; that could just be my phone, though. I probably will eventually become bored with the game, but that is no reflection on the game itself, as I tend to be more into word games.  Overall, a fun game that, at least for now, has me addicted!!

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|The best way to describe this movie is by saying, imagine watching \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" for the first time. it was that GREAT a film that transcended any expectation you had going in.

160059672X|5.0|Gorgeous photos of amazingly creative pieces, along with very clear instructions. The instructions cover both the specific projects and designing on your own, along with helpful tips like how to avoid your beaded piece becoming too small for your bracelet backing. The actual-size layouts provided for the collars look like they'll be very helpful. Can't wait till my supplies get here so I can try this out!<br /><br />My only real question is, where on earth did she find a needle that fits through size *15* seed beads?!<br /><br />I suggest anyone ordering this book also order (or get locally) the needed supplies to try out the technique as soon as the book arrives! The absolute minimum to start: Lacy's Stiff Stuff, at least one large cabochon or decorative button, E6000 glue, beading needles, nylon beading thread, and cylinder-type seed beads in size 11 and possibly 6 (aka E), 8, or 15 (several colors, or multiple finishes in one color, that complement your cabochon). You may also want other smallish beads or sequins. Once you've got a piece done you'll also need backing material, findings (ear wires, necklace catches, bracelet or ring blanks, pin backs, etc), and white glue (I recommend Sobo), but those can wait.
B008MBXFEM|1.0|Let me explain my star rating. It has nothing to do with the soundtrack which is great. Hans Zimmer is great.<br /><br />So I'm looking at the two choices here between the standard and the deluxe MP3. Seems there was three or four tracks that were exclusive to itunes (boo!), but they are now included here in the deluxe version. As of this writing, the deluxe version is 12.99 and the standard one is 7.99. A difference of five dollars. There are are three new tracks on the deluxe version, so if I bought the standard and just bought those three separately, i would be spending two less dollars. This is almost outright theft. Whoever set this price, (Amazon, the record label) is stealing from anyone who bought the deluxe album here. Now you can argue that hey it's only two dollars, but you know what? That's my two dollars, and when I first saw the difference in pricing my initial gut reaction was, \\"I'm just going to go steal it, because eff them.\\" It's this type of business practice that is killing the record labels, and is what drives people to steal.FYI I did not steal it, but instead chose the standard version.

0062071017|5.0|After reading this book, I think about strategy very differently than I did before and at a much deeper and more integrated level. How I wish I could have had this book when I was serving as chair of a board of directors several years ago. So often people (including me) talk about strategy when they don't really know how to think about it. What IS strategy, anyway? This book answers that question in an updated, thoughtful and important way. Cynthia Montgomery, the author, shares insights gained from 20 years of teaching accomplished executives and entrepreneurs who attended her executive education classes at the Harvard Business School. One important point she makes is that strategy is at the heart of a leader's role and is a never-ending task that answers the question \\"THIS is why our customers and clients will prefer a world with us rather than without us.\\" The book is a very good read and uses many powerful real world examples to illustrate her points.

B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|I am a big Nick Cage fan.  And where better to enjoy him as an actor than in a film which he plays an eccentric character with otherworldly abilities?  To be more specific, Cage is cast in the role of a Vegas stage magician with a peculiar power: a gift that allows him to see a couple minutes into the future.  Sadly, or fortunately, depending on your point of view, Cage's character is not able to limit his options to enhancing his magic act.  By stepping in as a good Samaritan, however, his abilities are brought to the attention of federal authorities, who naturally seek to use them to enhance national security--a good example of the old adage \\"no good deed goes unpunished.\\"  Julianne Moore plays the determined federal agent seeking to enlist him in her cause--whether he likes it or not!  At the same time, the life of Cage's magician is further complicated by the realization that a pretty girl he spots at a diner (played appealingly by Jessica Biel) seems to serve as a focus for his powers that may enable him to see much father into the future!
B008D28HYS|4.0|I got the original CrossMe as a free app of the day a while ago, and eventually I ended up buying this one. Yeah, I paid for it, oh well, at least my wife can get this for free since she missed the other one. I use this on my Acer Tablet, I wouldn't even want to think what it would be like on a smartphone, though HELL comes to mind quickly. Even on a 10\\" tablet, it can be hard to really take in.<br /><br />My only grief with both apps is that sometimes I have to try loading it a few times to make it work, sometimes it takes a round off app killer and quick reboot to get it to work, but other than that, its something fun to do while bored with my tablet, and it is a lot harder than the monocromatic version. New puzzles seem to appear every so often, which is also helpful.

B006ZZANDI|4.0|These boys definitely have talent.  Good vocals, good harmonies, good songs and lyrics.  This is the kind of good-hearted popular music you don't find anymore these days, and when you do it's all record comp any garbage and very repetitive.  Sure, these guys probably didn't write their own songs or play their instruments and the lyrcs have no personal value to them... but it's good music and that is rare these days.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I have always thought that it's my Kindle that's the source of occasional glitches when I play games.  now that I have played this game, which had absolutely no glitches, I know for sure that it's not my Kindle, it's that other games are not done right!  Compliments to the coders at NER Brothers!  Great job!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy using this app.  I also like that while I am doing something else on the kindle-I get a reminder to check in and read the Bible.  The plans to read the entire Bible are so well thought out and very doable.  I can not think of anything negative to write with an app that encourages one to be closer to God and understand his word better.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. I have a good idea for another version of this game. Marvel version. The jetpacks would be different iron man suits (Evil version - Hammer drones) . Lil stomper would be HULK ( Evil verion - RED HULK) . Mr Cuddles would be Spiderman ( Evil version - Black Spiderman ) . Bad as hog would be Captain America on a motor cycle, he would throw his shield at the A.I.M agents around the facility ( Bad version - Red skull, who would shoot the S.H.I.E.L.D agents around the helicarrier. Profit bird would be Wasp ( Bad version - The vulture) . I would like to say more but you get the Idea. Please post at the end of your comment.  ..!&quot; CODE avengersQ&quot;!..
B0033PQUXA|4.0|It is my favorite foreign film. I am excited that I now can watch this movie whenever I want to.
0451527712|5.0|I recently read Frankenstein and enjoyed it. She anticipated some of the themes in 20th century science fiction novels -- the danger of technology released from any ethical concerns and the unintended consequences of scientific experiments.
B008D28HYS|5.0|After receiving CrossMe for free, and completing all but one puzzle (after many hours of play time), I decided to purchase CrossMe Color.  It's even better than the regular version.  My favorite app, by far.  Developer promises that they don't data-mine, but even if they did, it would be worth it!  Love the game - keep them coming, please...
0783225881|5.0|I made the mistake of trying to understand this movie in the literal sense first time out. I thought it was new age \\"feel good\\" garbage.<br /><br />Then my sons were born, and I began to reflect on the passage of time, my childhood, playing little league baseball. I watched the movie a second time and WHAM! Everything snapped into place: the theme of redemption and unrealized dreams (Moonlight Graham, Costner's relationship with his father, Shoeless Joe Jackson's second chance, Terence Mann's cynicism) suddenly coalesced.<br /><br />At the heart of this lyrical and unique film is a recognition that life is an exquisitely beautiful tapestry of events, memory, relationships and dreams. Profound in it's simplicity and understatement. I have tried to explain to my wife and friends my emotional response to this film, but when I attempt to repeat Costner's line: \\"Hey... Dad... wanna have a catch?\\" my voice cracks and my eyes well up.<br /><br />I have never seen a film with this kind of magic. If heaven is anything like Ray's cornfield in Iowa, sign me up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Honestly, this book has done 2 things for me. Re-kindled my love for sci-fi literature and opened my eyes to the kindle market.<br /><br />This book had me reading with earnest again... mainly because it was both VERY well written but also a gripping and imaginative story.<br /><br />Loved it.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I loved this book it was amazing and very well written.... Recommend it!!! I stayed up reading it wanting to know how it would end ( i was hooked...) and the characters stayed in my heart...
0307887448|5.0|I read this book cover to cover in one sitting- I literally couldn't put it down. The story is interesting, the book is well paced, and the characterizations are excellent. The whole thing is held together by a wonderful set of anecdotes, inside jokes, and 80's pop culture references that will make most folks who lived through the era smile with nostalgia. Great read!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Top drawer stuff coming from the hearts and minds of 'YouVersion.' Have no fear, this will vault right into your choice for an great app.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Excellent, the app was easy to download and I can now read my Kindle purchases on my Samsung S Phone. And you don't need to buy a Kindle!
B008FOB124|5.0|...appreciate the maturity of this band and this work and enjoy the hell out of some of the best music to come across my ears in a very long time.

B007OTZ654|5.0|There is a curious phenomenon happening in the world of Bowie CD remasters, which we can hope portends an attitude change in the music industry as a whole regarding the remastering of classic albums. This phenomenon is, simply put, going back to basics. More specifically, it appears as though EMI is actually starting to recognize that the sound of the original Bowie albums, at the time they were made, doesn't require improving upon. Rather, the best a remastering can do is present the original sound in the most faithful manner possible, from the best possible sources. This 40th Anniversary remastering of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars does just that.<br /><br />Ironically, the original RCA Bowie CDs from the 1980s, which were lambasted at the time as subpar, actually did a pretty good job of staying faithful to the sound of the original LPs. Although they are rumored to have been from latter-generation sources, rather than the original master tapes, they have nevertheless held up very well in light of the reissues that followed: the anemic and overly bright Ryko reissues of the late `80s, and the bloated, heavily compressed Virgin/EMI remasters of the late `90s, which remain the standard versions available today. However, it was the 30th Anniversary edition of Ziggy Stardust that represented the nadir of all Bowie remasters: it sounded worse than even the '90s EMI remaster; worse yet, it actually removed portions of the music and reversed the stereo channels. It was an absolute travesty that never should have seen record store shelves, and it seemed to confirm the belief among audiophiles and music enthusiasts that the more the record companies tried to justify double and triple dips, the worse<br /><br />This newest release of Ziggy Stardust continues the trend, and may be the best sounding Bowie CD reissue yet. Remastered by Ray Staff, who engineered the original album back in 1971, this version comes full circle, sounding remarkablysimilar to both the original RCA LP and CD, but with a bit more sonic pop and presence, as well as clarity resulting from a superior transfer of the original master tape. This is miles better than either the 1999 EMI remaster or the ghastly 30th Anniversary edition (stereo channels are as they should be, and the segues are restored); it bests the Ryko version, as well. There is a certain irony that it took four CD reissues just to come back to the sound RCA got right in the first place, but with this remastering, we finally have the definitive Ziggy on CD. Here's hoping EMI makes this permanently available, and never seeks to improve upon it with a subsequent release. They really cannot do better
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|The down load and buy was very smooth.I evan had to re down load it after a phone screwd up and it wasnt a problem either.Keep up the good service Amazon ur one of the best.
B002QGSW8I|1.0|Since 92, I have read close to 1000 books. This, by far, has been one of the worst books I have ever read. I can't understand how or why this book was so bad. Probably because the language is so dry, you don't even care what's happening. In this book, James Rollins attempts to have a \\"Dan Brown type book.\\" But he falls WAY short! P.S. I read the book cover to cover and STILL don't know what the Doomsday Key is! lol
B00425S1H8|3.0|well i got this for a LED sign at work so i could plug it to my own personal computer but my computer just went out so i have yet to get to use it but im sure it works fine... the packaging was great as well so no issues so far except with my own computer =(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. Great story and some sensual material for late at night. And no I'm not some old lady. I'm a college student. And fifty shades is my getaway.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|I LOVE KISS Destroyer--Resurrected!!! Got it on Vinyl and it sounds AMAZING! Blows away the original mix. The guitars sound better--Peter's drums are awesome on this! There's also little things brought out on this mix never clearly heard before...Sweet Pain--now with the Ace solo--Don't know what the fuss was about back in the day and wasn't used on the original LP--I think it was a \\"power trip\\" used by Ezrin, Gene & Paul (go figure! even way back when!) Beth--WOW! Shout it out Loud--awesome! Sounds 10 times better! One of the best KISS rehash releases yet!<br /><br />I do wish that another KISS/Ezrin album would get a 2nd chance--I wish KISS ,under the direction of Ezrin, would re-record Music From The Elder live with an orchestra.....

B000JML7EC|5.0|I purchased this for my 11 year old son and he enjoyed reading it. It definitely kept his interest and he looked forward to reading time.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Love it!  I fell in love with the characters in this book and immediately.  I had to get \\"Point of Retreat\\" to find out what happened next.  Highly recommend both books!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the devotionals! So convenient to read anywhere, anytime. I love that you are able to switch between different versions. Love the highlighting and bookmarking options.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am very happy with this Kindle Fire case.  It is so light to carry and it protects my Kindle very well. I recommend it to whoever is looking to buy a great dependable case.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|The first time I saw this DVD, I was totally blown away by how amazingly professional Dream Theater is as a Live group.  The performance leaves absolutely nothing to be desired.<br />The production quality is outstanding--a big improvement over the Scenes From New York DVD.  The bonus features are awesome, and the Tour Documentary is really cool.  The one thing I noticed about rig rundowns is that they didn't demonstrate any sounds and Petrucci never got very specific about the pedals he was using or even amp settings, so if you're a musician, you might find the demonstration lacking somewhat.<br /><br />Other than that, this DVD sounds great and looks great.  They play a bunch of songs off Train of Thought as well as many others making for about a 170-minute run time. If you like Dream Theater, you will love this DVD!
044654759X|1.0|I really did want to like this book and was excited to read it. This is the first book I (tried to) read by Sparks and it will be the last. I was unable to finish the book. I do regret what I did read (about 5/6 of it).<br /><br />I am not into \\"adult only content\\" (you know what I mean) and so I figured since Sparks says he is a Christian, his writing would be light-hearted and \\"appropriate\\". I was wrong (I guess that is my error). I was very disturbed by the GRAPHIC sexual descriptions in this book. That was the first and largest issue I had with this book. Parents beware; I am 17 and had never read a book with such content. I can't believe this is meant for teens/young adults! Of course everyone has their own opinion on such topics, but this is mine.<br /><br />Furthermore, this was not a light-hearted/calming story. I did not feel happy or uplifted as I have with other romantic type books. It also seemed like a \\"cheap\\" story, shallow and filled with fillers such as vulgar descriptions and unnecessary suspense to keep the story moving. It did not flow nicely, not what I would call \\"quality writing\\".<br /><br /> I RARELY don't' finish what I start, but this book I had to drop. I could not finish it and am glad I didn't. Sorry if you love this book, this is just my opinion. I hope maybe some parents will be helped by this review.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|OMG! I love the fact that you can create your own VIDEO playlist. You can listen to videos over and over and over again! There is a variety of music from KORN to Una. Thrilled I can use and the cost is free. Cant get much better than that! I would definitely recommend this app to all Kindle Fire Users.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|When a boy in the 50's there were only 3 stations in N.Y.  There was a show called 'The Movie of the Week' and they would play the same movie 4 or 5 times a day, every day, for the week.  If it were King Kong, I watched it every single time that I was not in school or didn't have to be somewhere.  King Kong caught everyone's imagination and I have seen it 100's of times, never being bored.<br /><br />So how is the quality of this BluRay transfer.  Remember that this movie was released in 1933 so the technology was no where near what it is today.  My mother told me that her father took her to see the opening premier at Radio City Music Hall.  It's an old film.  However, with the discovery of an uncensored archive of the movie in the UK, the transfer quality to Blu Ray is about the best you can expect it to be.  There are some scenes early in the movie and a few with much daylight in them that do have plenty of grain but, at least for this movie, the grain brings you back to those old times and you never really notice it.  The jungle and stop motion scenes are beautiful to watch without artifacting and aliasing and without the film damage of dust and tears that we normally would come to expect.  The blacks are deep and unmolested.  In fact, in some areas they look a touch crushed.  Never the less, this is the best quality version of King Kong I have ever seen.  All censored scenes have been restored to the film as well.<br /><br />The audio is mono but the score fills the room and is clear and easy to understand so no complaints here that we do not have a 5.1 channel mix.  Heck, back in 33 the word stereo had not been invented yet.<br /><br />This brings me to my only complaint about the DVD itself.  I found that switching to sections of the menu was quite difficult.  When I first put it in the player the movie started with the subtitles running.  I went back to the menu but could not direct the highlighter to 'none' and had to  pop the disc out and put it back in again to go to the default.  This occurred a few times.  Same thing with the special extras, I found it very difficult to actually use the remote arrows to go to a specific extra.  I found that the easiest thing to do was just hit enter, and the extras played in order.<br /><br />The documentaries of the film makers and their inspirations were very interesting and informative and Peter Jackson's recreation( and how he went about it) of the lost spider sequence was just brilliant and, for me, well received.  He did the original film proud.<br /><br />For anyone even remotely considering the purchase of this Blu Ray DVD, go ahead, as a King Kong fan, you will be glad you did.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksin to go to the default.

B000059ZLH|5.0|I listened to the studio recording of Scenes From a Memory maybe 30 times before I even heard about this dvd.  When I finally saw it just this year (2012), it was like going back in time 13 years earlier to when I first heard these songs.  The video quality is not as pro-looking as the Live at Budokan DVD, but the sound is all there in spades, and the visual effects are pretty cool.  I really like the commentary by the whole band, and the documentary is enlightening.  The one thing that I thought was REALLY cool was having \\"A Change of Seasons\\" on the DVD as well.  That could have been a whole other DVD!<br /><br />Anyway, if you listen to Scenes From a Memory from time to time, you owe it to yourself to actually see the band playing these songs, not to mention all the other cool stuff on this DVD!
0061692042|4.0|In Richard Ford's Canada, he writes with a style that is almost a modern day version of Mark Twain with a good salting of Harper Lee.  One can't help but admire his ability to cast out enough hooks upon nearly every page to capture the interest of almost any reader.  The first hook is not very subtle in the opening sentence of the book, \\"First I'll tell you of the robbery our parents committed.  Then about the murders later.\\"<br /> The readers are then dragged (not unwillingly) across numerous State lines before being swept into the arms of the gentle giant to our north, Canada.  For good and for bad Canada is the neighbor that grants hope when the land to the south fails to provide a safety net.<br /> Our coming of age protagonist Dell Parsons, takes on the persona of a twentieth century Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn as life's challenges are thrust upon him and we do root for him through his dealings with very believable adversaries.  Through him we learn of a shadowy world so skillfully displayed it creates an avid interest with more than a mere ponderable fascination.<br /> Ford's research is solid and his simple prose and blunt metaphors are powerfully hypnotic, enough to leave one with some doubt.  Doubt that this is indeed just a story of fiction... or is it just that good?

B008D28HYS|1.0|Yesterday and today, it's the same thing: The app regularly costs $5, so the reviews are good. Well, I liked the first version of this game, so I'll probably like this one too.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Since I cannot possibly outdo the existing commentaries on the songs of this album, I will simply say that the whole album is amazing and tells an interesting story. Can't wait for the novel to come out in September.<br />I saw Rush play during the \\"Timemachine\\" tour two years ago and they played both \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B.\\" Can't wait to see them again this tour!
0345803485|4.0|This was an interesting read and definitely not a book I would have chosen for myself due to the S&M that it was portrayed to have been full of. However, I was hooked and read the series in under 2 weeks. Very Saucy!!

1451627297|5.0|I am a huge Stephen King fan, reading my first Stephen King novel (The Shining) at the age of 13.  As a fan, I really feel like his last three books have been the best of his career.  I could not put this book down.  I am not a big history buff, nor did I know much about the JFK assassination, aside from what we learn in school.  That being said, I was fascinated with the premise of this book and loved every word.  Bravo!

B000001EUR|5.0|The best, next to blackout, scorpion's cd. Music is great, cover is good. Nothing left to say :) Booklet containing lyrics, some extra photos - however not much, the booklet is pretty slim
1612183956|3.0|I found this book hard to review without commenting on enough of the plotline as to create a list of spoilers which I am going to avoid. I will just say that I picked this up as a Vine option, believing it to be in the mystery/thriller genre only to have it develop into something else (rather abruptly.)  Not all loose ends (antagonistic/agressive demeanor of the townsfolk, sadistic medical staff members, etc.) were fully tied up at the end from my perspective.  I'd read many good reviews for other books by this author, but don't think he's exactly my cup of tea.  Too many books, too little time to revisit this author's imagination in the future.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Excellent read. Author provides significant depth while also keeping the reader on edge his seat.  If you like historical fiction, you will love this series.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really like this app. It's fun and addicting, it's really cool. If you don't like the ads, JUST DON'T CLICK THEM! It's really not that hard! I think it's a bit limited, though, even for the free version. Maybe you could add a trial or something for the other modes? Overall, it's a great app. c:
0307341577|1.0|This books was slow, probably because it jumped back and forth between several people, as well as several different time periods. Libby present day. Ben 1982. Libby 1982. Libby present day. Patty 1982. Ben present day. etc.<br />The characters were unlikable, all of them. I just didn't care.<br />The one good thing I can say is that I did not know what was going to happen,or who was at fault. However, getting the answer to the mystery was not worth what I had to endure to get it.
B000001EUN|5.0|Good, old scorpions - cool tracks as \\"the zoo\\", \\"make it real\\" and others. I'm sure you won't find any bad song on this album :) Booklet containing lyrics plus some photos, a bit slim however. +1 point for my favourite scorpion's cover :)
B008D28HYS|4.0|i've just downloaded this game and played it for a few minutes after reading the more detailed instructions on wikipedia. i do think it's fun and addicting. the thing i don't like is that you never get to see the finished picture, because as soon as you finish it a menu pops up, blocking it.<br /><br />i'm on a kindle fire so i have no phone number for the app to abscond with, but i suppose i should be wary of the other permissions. and yet i'm not. i guess i feel like my data has already been stolen a hundred times over anyway, so what's a hundred and one? of course, now that i said that, something dastardly is bound to happen this time. maybe they'll clone me and give my clone all the ten dollars that's in my bank account. i just hope the clone doesn't take out a home loan in my name &amp; stick me with the mortgage, because that would really suck.
0880796863|3.0|I love the Rider Waite system. I think the muted colors in this deck are sophisticated and beautiful. I own probably 100 decks of different varieties. None are produced on such cheesy paper. These cards are extremely flimsy and printed on very poor card stock. I was so disappointed. They start to warp and bend while shuffling. This beautiful rendition deserves better.

B007KUFDBY|4.0|Treasure Planet is one of Disney's most obscure and unpopular movies. When it arrived in theaters on Nov. 2002, the film was a box office bomb failing to recoup even half its production cost. It received some recognition and it was even nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature but after this, it was condemned to oblivion.<br /><br />That's a shame actually since Treasure Planet is a great movie. It's not up there with the Disney classics or can be called a masterpiece but has enough power to be given a chance and this BD is the perfect opportunity to revisit or check this underrated treasure for the first time.<br /><br />Treasure Planet adapts the Robert Louis Stevenson's classic \\"Treasure Island\\" and converts the high sea adventure into an epic space adventure. The story follows Jim Hawkins, a 15 year old who lives with his mother and can't stay out of trouble. His father abandoned him when he was younger and this has affected Jim throughout his short life. His mother can't seem to understand him and Jim doesn't know where his place is. One day, an opportunity is given to Jim to finally prove himself and go in a quest that will change his life: the search of the mysterious Treasure Planet where an incalculable treasure is buried. Action, drama and adventure ensures in this epic journey.<br /><br />Treasure Planet does a lot things right. It's fast paced, its animation is breathtaking, the score is magnificent and the central characters are well developed. The filmmakers capture teen angst in a perfect and poignant way. The relationship between Jim and Silver is handled very well and is a much more complicated relationship than your typical animated film. All this makes the story engaging and interesting for everyone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are other things that Treasure Planet do not handle very well and the main problem are the supporting characters. They are not very well developed and the movie suffers as a result. The ship crew are random alien creatures which add nothing to the picture, it's like the animators just wanted to be crazy but the final result is not engaging. The relationship between Captain Amelia and Doctor Doppler feels forced but the greatest flaw is the robot B.E.N. The character almost ruined the movie. Is over the top and obnoxious in every single scene he's in. I know he was meant for laughs but his antics are unfunny throughout the film. All these characters take weight from the central emotional core of the film and should have been handled better, especially the robot.<br /><br />Anyhow, flaws and all, Treasure Planet is still a high spirited adventure with a great message and impeccable technical presentation. It does not deserve the reputation it has and hopefully more people will re-discover it and give it a better place in the Disney canon.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Treasure Planet debuts on BD in a near perfect presentation. Some minor banding appears in some scenes but nothing to be concern about. The picture is crystal clear, colors pop off the screen and detail and delineation is just breathtaking. This is one of Disney's best BD presentations.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is a bombastic experience with good directionality and crystal clear dialogue. A wonderful experience all around.<br /><br />Bonus Features<br />While no new bonus material was produced for this BD, most of the DVD material has been carried over and while is not as extensive as it could, most of the material is engaging and informative.<br /><br />You have an audio commentary with the filmmakers and several featurettes concerning the making of the film and the different stages of production (animation, design, music, story, etc), publicity material and more.<br /><br />A DVD copy is also included.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />Treasure Planet is an epic adventure that makes for an enjoyable experience. It's not perfect and has some glaring flaws but the final product is far better than itsreputation would suggest. It's not Disney's best but it isn't its worst either and deserves to be seen at least once. This BD makes things easier with an impeccable technical presentation and worthy bonus material.

B008Z9YLV2|2.0|...and you've got a classic B movie here. Think \\"Running Man\\" meets \\"Twilight\\". A terrible screenplay and huge plot holes. Just one example: \\"Half of you will die from cold, thirst and hunger!\\". Really? (not one actually faced real cold, thirst or hunger). This movie is not dramatic enough to move you and not campy enough to make you smile. Two stars for effort....barely.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|The movie Courageous is an awesome and life changing Christian movie.  It will change your life as it did me.  Every family should see it and put Jesus in the center of their lives.
0807014273|5.0|I read this book shortly after it was written and many times since.  Because I believe the ideas it contains are so critical to the human condition, I have given a copy to all my children and to each grandchild when they became young adults.  Since I was a teenager when the dreadful truth about the camps was revealed, the horror of the paths some people can take to abuse others was mind boggling.  Frankl's message of hope was essential.  After 80 years of life, it seems his words are, unfortunately, as necessary as ever.
B008602KQI|5.0|When i watched this movie i wanted to cry. It was very touching and they didn't leave too much out of the movie. The movie was as good as the book and i cant wait to see how the 2nd movie will be.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have been wondering for a long time how so many people could be at so far extremes in their reviews of the same book.  It has to be some form of deception.  Shame on you Amazon.  I'll never ever trust your reviews again.  And no, i do not believe that you are not a party to it.  Pathetic!  And why do not the negative reviews even call this evil book what it really is....  That would be pedophilia.  So sad.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I got the book and the CD when they came out and it went far beyond my expectations. This soundtrack is a perfect marriage to the book and Nikki is one of the most thought provoking individuals on this planet. His story is real, raw, unscripted, brutally hideous, and beautiful. This album is timeless and truly some of the best music of the 2000's. Any music fan who appreciates unadulterated truth will love The Heroin Diaries.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Fact, fiction, history, horror, pseudo-martial arts and mythology are impressively rolled into one in this unique film. I had my doubts about seeing this motion picture, but I was pleasantly surprised and actually quite impressed by this film's visual style. It truly has a nightmarish quality about and that is the one lingering after effect of this strange film. Many parts of this film come off rather camp and history is reduced to a very minimalist artistic form of art, yet these very aspects of the film add to its strange and unsettling effect on the viewer. At times the film reassembles a very low budget television mini-series while at others it looks like a widescreen extravaganza. I saw the film in both the standard flat-screen presentation and the very impressive and technically astounding 3-D version. The film has a strange curiously voyeuristic quality about it. The almost bleached out colors, slow motion shots and digital editing, baroque costume designs and haunting set decorations and designs bolster these. The overall premise of the film is quite ludicrous, but it always takes itself quite seriously. And that is what makes this movie work as a very entertaining and haunting piece of filmmaking.
B004T5R2HQ|4.0|I downloaded this app thinking it would just be a glorified way to take pictures of documents. Which didn't really work in the past, but I was in need of a scanner at that particular moment, so I downloaded it. I was genuinely pleasantly surprised! The app works like a charm! It wasn't like just taking a photo of a document at all. It has the ability to send it directly from your phone to any email address, facebook, twitter, and several other multimedia venues. The only problem that I have with it is that the version I have will only allow me to scan 10 items before it tells me I must purchase the upgraded version to have unlimited scanning ability. But for free, I can live with the limit of 10. I would recommend this app to anyone who needs a portable scanner.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack Joyride is one of the best free games available. The concept is very simple and easy to pick up, but missions, achievements and a load of gadgets and customizations keep things fresh and entertaining.<br /><br />My only trouble is frequent crashes on the Kindle Fire. Once the stability is improved this will be an easy 5-stars.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time. I love the bravery that Katniss has. When you think of the story it has it is horrible. 24 kids go in this arena and kill each other. So it can be quite sad (spoiler alert) like when rue dies. i saw this in the theater and got it at midnight. the bluray looks so good with it. havnt seen on tablet yet but will update when i do. i would diffidently get this movie it is one of the best of all time cant wait for second.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Overrated book.  Why on the best-seller list for weeks? Straight sex scenes were detailed and arousing, but going through the poorly-written prose to get there was annoying. The first-person narrative, with Ana's thoughts in italics, was kind of cheesey (\\"Wow\\", \\"Holy shit\\").  I'll take some time off to read better quality books, then give the second book a try, since I've heard that it's better than book one.

0345803485|2.0|I was expecting something crazy but it was sooo soft core. I don't understand why this book was soo taboo. The story has potential and I understand that it's the authors first book... But come on! The characters had no personality except for Grey. Half time you forget he's twenty something, because he sounds like an old man and he calls guys he's age boy or kid.<br /><br />I hate how the main character was written. She has no self esteem, always talks about her \\"inner goddess\\", and somehow any man that comes in contact with her is obsess with her. Over all the story had no real plot and it could have been told within a hundred pages. Most of the book is all \\"should I's or shouldn't I\\", it's erking. I was expecting something like Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty but it's no way near close. Since I did read the whole book I'll read the second to see where story goes.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|For my purposes I don't know of a better App than TuneIn Radio Pro (TRP).<br /><br />It's Everywhere I Go:<br />I first used TuneIn Radio Pro on my Archos A5A. I've used it on Archos 7\\" & 10\\" gen 8 tablets. I use it on my Kindle Fire, my iPad 3, and on my Windows and Mac PCs via their web site. It's one of the first Apps I'll install on my GN10.1 when it comes in today.<br /><br />Presets > Favorites:<br />It's everywhere I go because of its Presets which are now called Favorites. Once installed and logged in (first time only) then all your existing Favorites are available. Add a new Favorite and it's now available anywhere you're accessing Tunein Radio as well.<br /><br />Recording:<br />I haven't done much, but when a friend had a late night local music radio show I was able to record it for playback the next day. Fabulous!!<br /><br />Clock Radio/Sleep Timer:<br />I first used this on the iPad 3 version. Nice features for those of us who sometimes want to fall asleep and wake up to our favorite radio stations.<br /><br />Instead of OTA:<br />I like a couple of local stations which I can easily get from my car radio but not my home radios: Hills get in the way. Along comes TRP and now I can listen to my local favorites at home.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />With the fast pace of techno developments no programs, or Apps, have (and keep) all the features I might dream up in my desires. Still, TRP provides me lots of happy times for very little cost.<br /><br />I highly recommend TRP. Mahalo nui loa to the TRP devs!<br /><br />Aloha.. Al
0765348276|4.0|Old Man's War is my first exposure to the works of John Scalzi, a writer whom I've heard many wonderful things about (usually things like \\"you're a writer; how can you not know Scalzi?\\"). My interest in OMW stems from the fact that it's patterned after Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers, a personal favorite of mine; I figured, since Heinlein's inspired me so much (both my writing and my life), I might give Scalzi a shot. Quite honestly, he lives up to the reputation my friends gave him, albeit with some glaring flaws.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts: 1,2, and 3 (see what I did there?); simple, right? Well, the entire first part is extremely boring. I'd purchased this book in late May, and when it arrived, I only made it to page 50 before dropping it. I recently took it up again because I hate leaving things halfway. Having finished the first part, I remember asking myself whether finishing it would be worth it; I'm a person who believes that if a book/movie/TV/game wants to justify its existence, then it has to hook you with the first few chapters (minutes, levels, etc). Scalzi misses this mark by a lot; I understand that he's trying to build a universe here, but I honestly feel that too little happens over the first part to justify its length. Perhaps I would've taken a better liking to it if it had happened over a shorter page-span; some of these, like how the main character, John Perry, prepared himself for enlistment, could've been placed in the book's middle and have had an equal, if better result. And this is the only story detail I dare touch, out of fear of spoiling the rest for you.<br /><br />Having said that though, part two really picks up the ante. The character is thrown into boot camp, with a DI that reminds me of Major Zim from the Starship Troopers film. I found this particular character to be enjoyable, albeit somewhat underused (though given the story, it's understandable). That being said, I hope he shows up again in the rest of the series. Still, the rest of the book suffers from rather one-dimensional characters. I didn't really feel any sort of attachment to many of them, and I was actually glad when one of them died. Then again, this is the story of one man; Perry seems much more memorable than the average science fiction space marine, so I guess I can let that slide.<br /><br />The book has a mildly disappointing ending though, but I guess it makes sense within context; in my opinion, it felt rushed, skipping you from the epic final battle to the end credits before you realize that the book is done. But again, it makes sense in context; some of the other flaws within the book make sense, so I guess I might just be nitpicking. In fact, despite all this, I still recommend it; Perry's story is compelling enough to actually merit the slow introduction, and the ending, albeit abrupt, actually befits the story pretty well; in fact, I would call most of my criticisms `nitpicks' rather than legitimate concerns. After finishing page one, I read the entire book in one day, and I felt pretty satisfied with my feet. I'm even interested in reading the rest of the series, at least after I get rid of my book backlog.<br /><br />So, to sum up the positives in a quick checklist:<br />-Good story<br />-Humorous dialogue<br />-Interesting backstory, technology, and universe<br /><br />And of course, the negatives:<br />-Horrible pacing<br />-Lack of memorable characters<br /><br />As mentioned, I feel my criticisms are actually nitpicks, so from an objective standpoint, the novel is actually quite superb. As a result, I give it four out of five; read without fear.the series. Still, the rest of the book suffers from rather one-dimensional characters.

B001CDWFPC|3.0|This is an excellent Bible, but not for Kindle.  It is too hard to navigate to the concordance.  My friend has one of these bibles and I really enjoy it.  Now I wish I would have purchased the book, rather then the electronic version.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Seeing as I was thoroughly unimpressed with the books due to its static characters, poorly developed universe, and bad writing, I don't really know why I expected more out of the movie. But, that's not its only pitfall, the movie's first downturn is the fact that the film makers don't feel as though they have to actually put in the work for a quality film because they are fully aware this series will create a cash cow of a franchise no matter what they throw up on the screen, so long as its as line by line to the book as it can get. Just because it's an accurate representation, doesn't been its a quality representation. Taking Lord of the Rings for example, they took their creative freedoms to translate a phenomenal literary masterpiece onto the big screen, which meant they had to change a few things from the books, which is perfectly acceptable, because the film makers are doing the source material justice.<br />But, as I said in the beginning, I was not impressed with the books, therefor, I shouldn't expect a whole lot more from the films.

For any one disillusioned with some of latest over compressed garbage...IE...latest Rush album amongst others...this shines on a good system.<br /><br />\\"It doesn't sound like noise Mr. Vai!\\"<br /><br />Thank you!
030758836X|5.0|This may be the scariest book I've read in years.  Told in alternating chapters from husband's and wife's points of views, it is a story of a marriage gone bad ... and from bad to worse, then even worser.  Neither character is all that likeable, both are entirely believable, the plot twists are not in the least bit contrived, and you get sucked in deeper with every twist. And the twists get twistier and twistier.  This is a sneaky piece of work, perfectly-written and worth every minute spent with it.

B004LROMWU|5.0|This is a great show. I consider it on the same level as shows like The Walking Dead. If you like end-of-the-world drama with lots of twists and turns and great relationship/character development, you will enjoy Falling Skies. Just finished watching Season 2 on TV as well--even better than the first. Can't wait for it to come out on DVD.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|Okay, so it is obvious that the book is a prequel to the Maze Runner Trilogy but.. I was a bit taken back at how little of the book actually discusses the history of Thomas/Teresa.  It was interesting to hear how horrible everything was after the Solar Flares and the new characters were interesting.. but..<br /><br />(Spoiler alert)<br /><br />Here is my main gripe with the book.  First, I was never very keen on the whole Zombie / madness aspect of \\"the Scorch Trials\\", so that might tell you why I didn't like this book as much.  I really couldn't help but laugh at how the virus was distributed.. shooting Darts?  And.. then.. the reality of having too many people with not enough resources was fine but it really seemed kind of silly that they would decide to kill everyone off humanely with a brain destroying virus?<br /><br />Again, please don't read any further if you don't want to spoil the book but I got through about 95% of the book and just threw my arms up in the air when it became clear they weren't going to discuss Thomas or any of the other main characters from the main book.  Yes, I know they would have just been little kids but they never explained the relationship with Theresa and Thomas (how did they learn to do telepathy?).  I would have been okay with 50% of the book explaining where the virus came from but seriously.. why not spend a little time talking about the families who gave their kids to the cause of finding a cure for the disease?<br /><br />Sorry, I was almost expecting there would be a trilogy of books for the prequel because it just didn't go far enough for me.  And, to be honest, if I had not read another review on Amazon explaining that DeeDee was actually Teresa I would never have caught that twist.  Throw me a bone.. I kept thinking that little girl was Teresa but it never clearly stated that anywhere (perhaps in book 3?)<br /><br />I do feel bad giving it such a bad rating because it was quite entertaining (if you didn't read the first3 books).  It just seemed a bit too horrific at times and disturbing with all the Zombie business.  It seemed like the book was preparing to be an action movie.. after the 10th fight scene.<br /><br />Regardless, I really enjoyed all the first 3 books, so I had to read it.. just to see.  It didn't quite go where I wanted it to go.. but I guess that is the author's decision.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book would have to be the most ridiculous awful book I have ever read. I only kept going because I couldn't believe that this garbage was a best seller. In the end I just skim read the pages which didn't matter because NOTHING happened apart from the cringe worthy sex descriptions. I definitely won't be buying or reading the other two books. Am looking forward to getting a decent book to read. Sad for the world really, that this type of garbage is a best seller. It beggars belief that with all the fabulous books out there that this inane drivel tops the best seller list.

B008D28HYS|5.0|I downloaded the black and white version as a FAOTD and liked it so much I paid for the color version two months ago. After DAILY use, I am STILL not finished with all the levels and they add more levels on a fairly regular basis. All those crying foul for data mining, you have to OPT IN to the ScoreLoop. I have no interest in spamming my friends with my finished puzzles, so I have never activated the ScoreLoop option. 99% of the time, I play this game with the wi-fi off on my Kindle Fire with no issues. It's a great and challenging puzzle game.<br /><br />UPDATE: Wanted to add that the developers are great with keeping new content flowing. I only recently finished all of the current puzzles and noticed a new update on my Fire today. This makes 4 months of constant use, including several road trips, without running out of puzzles. You truly get your money's worth out of this app.

But, Oh My, the teenagers I'm in contact with have all read the book - some liked it, some not.  Holy Crap, what is the literary world coming to??

B0084IG7KC|3.0|I was not impressed by the Hunger Games, and it's certainly not one of the year's best films. The story attempts to cross several genres and doesn't accomplish any with much success. It has elements of action/adventure, drama, and science fiction. The concept of The Hunger Games as a futuristic reality-based television show makes the plot somewhat akin to The Running Man or perhaps even the Truman Show. Each of these films achieves more with their focused approach (i.e. The Running Man with its action scifi ambitions, and The Truman Show as it elicits a stronger emotional bond with the protagonist).<br /><br />It's not simply that The Hunger Games suffers an identity crisis. The journey is predictable and shallow, creating ambivalence regarding the outcome of our \\"heroes.\\" The action sequences do little to peak interest, and at best, simply progress the story to the end credits. I have not read any of the books, but I presume they provide more context about the futuristic society depicted in the Hunger Games. If so, more of these elements should have been intertwined with the screen play. As it is, the movie is forgettable. I placed the blu ray back into its case where it will likely stay, perhaps unaccompanied by any sequels that may follow.<br /><br />By the way, I have noticed that any reviews that give this movie a mediocre or poor review is typically judged \\"not helpful\\" by voters. Are these reviews truly not helpful or just conflict with your opinion? I sense it's the latter... just like politics, if another person's opinion doesn't agree with yours, then it must not be worth hearing.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a very fun and rewarding game especially when you play with someone like you that can't draw very well. You don't have to be an artist to enjoy this game. The only con is that you can't play on a computer.

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|First of all, the game itself is great. Plays exactly like the iOS version, and actually seems to have a few extra features in the shop comparatively (namely equippable 'Gadgets', unless those have been added recently to the iOS version as well).<br /><br />The only difference in playing the game is that the framerate and graphics are not quite as stellar. The graphics are still very well done 2D animation, it just doesn't look quite as polished as on the iPad, though obviously that device sets a high bar for comparison.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Android version of this game does suffer from some serious technical issues. First of all, the game is huge - 30 to 35 megabytes installed (not uncommon for high-end games these days), thankfully only about 500K of data space after an hour or so of play, but egregiously about 15MB of cache space even after the game is fully quit out of. This issue means that my phone, which I keep just out of \\"low-space\\" state (which makes it not download new mail), actually goes into \\"extremely low-space state\\", which makes it not even receive text messages. Hopefully the game will be fixed to at least clear its cache on close, but for now it means I can't play this game at all for worry of missing important messages while I'm in-game or before I've had a chance to clear the cache MANUALLY. Thankfully, Android makes it relatively easy to access this information, so it is at least temporarily fixable, but the issue does reappear any time the game is played again.<br /><br />Overall, I am very excited to finally see this game on Android. The game retains its supreme charm and just-one-more-run addictiveness, technical flaws merely detract a little from the experience.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Waited patiently for this app and it is finally here!  Very easy to use and pin.  I may never \\"read\\" on my Kindle Fire again! :-)
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The Presidents Club is a well written and dynamic book about the people that 350million Americans place in the highest office of the land, the freest country on the planet, and the relationship of those very select few and their relationship to each other before, during , and after leaving office. It is a club with protocols that might well be emulated by Americans. Outstanding read. Well researched, with info and stories not previously read about. Thanks ...Martin
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I was thinking to myself I think its going to be boring ......but it really fun!!! I recamend it to any age :)
B0086700CM|4.0|this app is very fun but it is extremely hard to play on the amazon kindle fire I like it a lot
076115678X|4.0|I have two curly girls and both have very different types.  This book was helpful because it covers a wide range of different curls and gives information on care for all types. She is not as specific as I would have liked and I didn't know which products would work well or not.  Perhaps because she has her own line of products she didn't want to mention anything specific. It was helpful regarding cutting of curly hair.
0345803485|5.0|I am on my second book now and am loving it! I only bought one to start with as there were so many mixed reviews. But before I finished the first one I ordered the next two. I could not put it down. I agree that there are a lot of repetitive words and perhaps settings, but thats what happens in life. We live in the same place, we date the same man, we like the same food and wear the same clothes! What is so shocking about that? There were a lot of moment of \\"firsts\\" that reminded me of my previous experiences, which was really nice... This is a very easy and uncomplicated read which you cannot put down. I love it and can't wait for the movie to come out...
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I'm a fan of picsart myself, which is a free photo editor, but this does have some features that work better, they compliment each other really. I like having both depending on what kind of edits I want
0684833395|1.0|Take war, mix in the Marx Brothers, and place them in Alice's Wonderland, and you have Catch-22...only the book isn't nearly as interesting as I just made it sound.  It is simply one of the most tedious, poorly-written books I've ever read.  It makes its point well within the first 100 pages, then spends the next 300 plus pages beating you over the head making the same point.  War is hell, the military bureaucracy is tedious and illogical, war profiteering (capitalism?)is evil, there is no God, there are bigots in the world (and half of them are in Yossarian's chain of command), blah blah blah.  The characters are shallow, cold, and completely unlikeable - perhaps none more so than our poor, put-upon Capt. Yossarian, although I don't think that was the author's intent.  I appreciate the literary device of absurdity as much as anyone, but its overuse in this novel struck me as...well, absurd.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Ignore the other reviews. This is masterfully written, with scalpel sharp characterization, and one of the few books where the instant I finished, I knew I'd read again. And again. Once you realize what's really happening, you want to go back and parse every sentence from both characters. Yes, the characters are unlikable. They're hilariously screwed up, dysfunctional brilliant idiots. I don't watch movies or read books to be lulled by pablum. I want my brain engaged. This was great fun.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The main reason I purchased a Kindle Fire was because of Angry Birds, and I haven't been disappointed in any of the games.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app cause I can download songs that are not for sale! plus it is a lot quicker than searching it on the Internet!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I'm 16 n still love the kid games. this is one of my new favorites once u get the hang of it and understand it. it fun!
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Was so excited that the kit came in time for me to use on a trip to the Minnesota Zoo.<br /><br />Got into the car after a day of picture-taking, plugged it into my iPad2, plugged in the SD reader and my card ... nothing.<br /><br />Wiggled and unplugged and replugged and the only sign my iPad was even reading it was once when a brief message popped up announcing that \\"this accessory wasn't compatible with my device.\\" The rest of the time, the iPad didn't even read/acknowledge it was plugged in.<br /><br />I hope (?!) this is just a case of one defective product and not that it doesn't work at all ... as it is, returning something is always a big hassle and childishly, I am really disappointed.
B005LAIHHC|1.0|Why someone like him , ascending in tv and borat , make 2 trash movies ? A soft gay porn movie and now a trash like this. He burn out yourself with this, \\"why\\" , this is the question.
B007VYQ9G2|3.0|I saw this movie on opening night when it was released in theaters. There were definitely some good points, but there were also an equal number of bad points -<br /><br />Good Points -<br /><br />(1) Nature footage extraordinary! Seeing the natural world in all its glory and splendor was awe inspiring.<br />(2) The story itself, and witnessing the remarkably rare event between Oscar and Freddy was simply awesome (- not giving away any spoilers). Jane Goodall commented after the fact that this event is exceptionally rare in nature, and to capture it on film, I felt truly privileged to watch it happen.<br />(3) Generally a good nature documentary which captures and educates the viewers on the natural chimpanzee behaviors.<br /><br />Bad Points -<br /><br />(1) I said \\"generally\\" good nature documentary because there were some inaccuracies. The chimpanzees greatest threat by far is people. In the movie, it was reported as something else.<br />(2) The over the top narration by Tim Allen was horrible. I was expecting narration like African Cats with Samuel Jackson, and even a similar script....not quite the case here.<br />(3) Labeling one group of chimpanzees as good and the other as bad just is not accurate. Ok I get it, Disney is trying to tell a story aimed at little kids, but cmon! There is nothing evil or inherently bad about about nature.<br /><br />In summary, I am still going to buy this blueray, however, I am disappointed to say that it is not as good as other nature documentaries, but still worth the money.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This is a must have for Blues and Stones fans. I had this on VHS and this is MUCH better.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I love this app.  I find that certain elements really challenge my thinking and help me realize what I need to work on.  Especially remembering numbers, I always thought I was good but not so.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app is very addicting. When you start you can't stop. I am nine and I enjoy it very much. I recommend this app to 8 and up. There is no ads, no commercials just me and my free blow up action game. Hope this helps.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I wanted to complete the trilogy hoping that the story line would improve.  It was painful to read.  I would not recommend this book.
B007DIQC90|4.0|To be honest right now this is one of my favorite bands to listen to. The CD hasn't left my car. I like the lyrics and the sound of the vocals and the instrumentals. Overall it is an amazing CD. However I must admit it all does sound, for the most part, the same. That doesn't mean that it gets old fast or if you heard one you have heard it all, it simply means there isn't any real change in sound. It just makes me think there is no viable future for their music if they keep it like this. They reuse lots of things throughout their songs for example the use of saying \\"HEY!\\" in between verses and such. I see how this sounds like I wouldn't like the album but I really do, I think they have a great sound. In my opinion it just needs a bit more variety then just messing with the tempo of songs.<br /><br />Overall I would suggest that you buy it or at least give it a listen to. Little Talks isn't the best song by far so give it a whirl. You won't regret it.
B007EPESOS|4.0|Hitchens was unreliable on principle; but his gift for prose polemic never forsook him - nor his scathing contempt for humbug. This book has those qualities at their best.
030758836X|4.0|This is a fun, insane, unexpected commentary on modern marriage. It is a fast interesting read but has so many layers to discuss and ponder. A great book club choice and a good one for couples to read together. Especially those married in the 4-10 year range.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Just an amazing book! Well written and a great story, the sequel is great too! Very happy with this purchase and will buy again from same author.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I'm so glad this got FAOTD I love the original and was wondering if they were going to get this one.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Been useing this stuff for a long time, pretty cheap and works very well at lowering cpu temp. No need to look elseware.
B0086900TI|5.0|Adrian Brody deserves another Academy Award for his performance in Detachment! Yes, this film is hard to watch in parts (I do wish they had left out the brief animal cruelty scene and the smoking!), with so many of the students being good examples for better birth control, but I still believe that it has a redeeming message for the real heroes of the USA: TEACHERS, who help our kids to become better people (well, most of them!)
