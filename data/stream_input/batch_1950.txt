B00AIQP9DE|5.0|the game is good thus far.  i am wanting to be inside this game! it just keeps me wanting more.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Sensational TV series.  Excellent intelligent dialogue. Brilliant script. Gorgeous cast and incredible wardrobe picks.  Everybody did excellent job to make this show so successful. Emily Thorn rocks!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Must read!!!  It sucks you in from the first sentence and makes you not want to put it down!! Also it makes y o u want to read all the older classics that are referenced in this book
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What fun! I find it next to impossible to put this little game down.  Wonderful for rainy days and sleepless nights!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Free version is good, not good enough to pay $5 for the full version.<br />It is worth the free play though.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|My Son loves it . Him and I spend hours putting these things together . It reminds of the days when I was a kid playing with Legos .
B00886XQO0|4.0|I checked the price and reviews of these gaming headphones for weeks before I decided to take the plunge and buy them. I bought them for $250 on Amazon. In this review I will rate the product and not the price associated with it. I have owned them now for just over a month and have used them for an average of 2 to 3 hours a day. Some days more. Some days less. I have owned Turtle Beach DX12 (TB X12 w/ DSS surround sound processing) and briefly owned the Turtle Beach XP400 headset for two months. I have had great experiences with all of these products. <br /><br />Now for the review. I love these headphones. The fact that they are completely wireless is so much more convenient than I could have imagined. I loved my DX12 headset... but the wires always seemed to get in the way. always. Thats when I started looking for a new headset. Keep in mind, even the chat is wireless because the headset comes with a BT dongle that plugs into the 2.5mm on the xbox controller. Then you sync it and you're good to go! <br /><br />A lot of people claim that this headset feels cheap. To me they don't feel cheap at all. Headphones are supposed to be light so they don't weigh on your head. If anything they are a little heavier than I'd like. The materials on these are premium materials. Leather and memory foam are not &#34;cheap&#34;.<br /><br />The headphones sound great. If you're going to listen to music with them you should get an equalizer to really make them sound the best. Like with any headphones. When I play video games (black ops 2, battlefield 3, etc) at a loud volume I prefer to have the treble increased but not the base. I feel the base can't handle being boosted at a loud game volume. And I feel it will only wear on the speakers. The base still sounds great on this setting though! It's crisp and deep and you can still feel the rumble. <br /><br />Some people claim that they are not loud enough for in game play. While this is something you can fix in the software by turtle beach to adjust the equalizer and presets, I wouldn't bother. They go plenty loud. And that's coming from someone who listens to music very loudly and may suffer with some serious ear issues in the future. <br /><br />The wireless connection is flawless! You will not hear any static or feedback at all. However, while on Xbox live my friends have complained several times that they cannot hear me very well and that I sound a little muffled. They can still hear me though. It's not terrible. Just not as strong as a direct connection. <br /><br />The features on these are great! I use them on my computer all the time by using the auxiliary plug you can buy separately. The battery life is long but doesn't give you much warning before they die. It will tell you &#34;battery low&#34; every few seconds until you plug them in and it can get very annoying very quick. Just keep them charged and its not a problem. <br /><br />There are many presets to choose from. I have only been interested in a few of them however. And still need to try the others. But having the options is nice and it allows you to pick up on footsteps and other helpful enemy cues which is really nice. <br /><br />Now for the comfort which I think is one of the most important things when considering new headphones. They are ... Okay with comfort. It could just be me, but the tops of my ears begin to hurt after a couple hours of wearing them. I have adjusted the headband tighter and that helped pull them higher off the tops of my ears making them much more comfortable. They don't give me too many problems anymore. But everyonce in a while I can feel some discomfort after several hours. Again I say, it could just be me. All the turtle beach headsets never gave me any comfort issues at all. These are the first. <br /><br />I actually considered returning these and getting the xp400 but I decided to keep working with them. And overall I'm glad I did. The Bluetooth feature is great and something the xp400sdon't offer at the same extent as the Tangos. The stand it comes with is also really good looking. And the ear cups do a lot more for noise canceling than the xp400s. The xp400 are still an excellent headset and much cheaper than the Tangos. <br /><br />Overall, I would rate these headphones a four star rating. I love them. But there are those small things that need improving before deserving a five star perfect rating.don't offer at the same extent as the Tangos. The stand it comes with is also really good looking.

B00A757EFW|3.0|I love pac-man and this brings back a lot of memorys but playing it on a seven inch tablet is kind of hard. maybe once i get used to it, it will get better.
B0093F3PVY|5.0|Noel Gallagher is the greatest song writer ever....he deserves my money and yours. You know he does and his music is amazing!
B009T3AE1Y|4.0|This movie wasn't at all what i expected.  Was worth the 9.96 i payed.  It takes a while to get use to the storyline. Not sure I understand  it still..
B005KELW26|4.0|I got a Kindle Fire for Christmas and was anxious to get a case for it to protect it.<br />The purple is darker in person that it is in the picture, but still very nice. I'm not crazy about the magnetic flap closure - it gets in the way of the screen when it's opened.<br />It also took almost 3 weeks to arrive from when I ordered it, which is unusual for Amazon in my experience.
B003DZX3SA|1.0|I'm not very happy with this purchase.  It doesn't work half the time and I am to lazy to try and return it.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I didn't even realize until after I started watching it that the mastermind behind Nightwatch had his hands all over this movie. Given the style and effects, you could tell.<br /><br />I loved all of the little nods to historical events, my favorite of which would give away part of the plot, so I won't say more than that.<br /><br />The action, choreography, and effects were all a ton of fun to watch.<br /><br />And I couldn't figure out why Abraham's wife looked so familiar. Uh, Ramona Flowers, anyone? Even though they're completely different characters, you still get a bunch of the quirkiness that I loved about Ramona in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.<br /><br />If nothing else, definitely destined to be a cult classic.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|This movie has lots of violence.  Definitely worth a watch as long as you are an adult and know the difference between fact and fiction.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|Well worth the rental fee.  Loved the CGI.  Don't have to worry about naked sex scenes in front of the kids.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Robert Pattinson is to die for in this movie. Didn't expect it to end the way it did.  Worth the money.
B000HKWCOA|3.0|When Star Trek Enterprise first aired, I never could get into the series. Eventually I saw all the episodes at least once. There are probably a number of contributing reasons that Enterprise seemed only average to me but I think the major reason is Scott Bakula playing Captain Archer. I like Scott Bakula but he seems to come up short as a Star Fleet Captain; to me this was by not being able to project enough of a command presence in the vast majority of the series. In a way, it was kind of difficult to take him seriously most of the time. In season four with the two part mirror universe episodes (In a Mirror Darkly), I actually liked his role as Captain.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There are  no words...you just need to read it. A  raunchy as this novel gets, it's beautifully told and seductively.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|It's pretty simple to enjoy! One of those games to break the monotony of the day but your too warn out to put in too much effort. It takes a lot of coins a peanut to complete things!!! If it's a free game...or even if it was not free. I'm not spending money to play something like this. Games are suppose to be fun. Spending my money in order to play....is not fun!!!!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Could not stop reading this, loved Enzo immediately. I have oftened wondered about my own Labs how they respond and their expressions when I talk to them. This read is great, funny, sad, the author must have been a dog, weeks later and I'm still thinking about it, I'm probably going to read it over and I rarely do that.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Like Angry Birds.  I shared it with my grandkids and they loved it. They are better at it then me.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Honestly, it is a good Resident Evil movie. There are some odd plot points but those are explained away very well. it is action all the way. It will never win any awards but it was lots of fun, what do you expect from a Resident Evil movie?
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I like the game. It's different from what I usually play.  Sometimes I get angry trying to get the pigs.
B002ZG999U|4.0|This a gift and I haven't seen, but I do like the actors and the storyline.hope to see it soon.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I like this game very much.  It's fast and a little challenging. Jewels Star is the kind of games I like.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Disney/Pixar has presented this well on DVD. Both Widescreen and Pan & Scan versions are available on the first disc. The second disc has games, outtakes, an award winning animated short, and a fun  Easter Egg.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|I actually bought this movie for my husband for Christmas, its one of his favorites. He was so surprised when he opened it on Christmas morning and absolutely loved it. I wanted to get him the blue ray one but you guys didn't have any instock brand new just used and I wanted a brand new one. But he is still very happy that he has it and can watch it anytime he wants. It was a great purchase. Thank You!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My cousin had it but he never played it so I wanna try it let see how it turns out peace games lover$$$:c
B009CPJHY4|5.0|It was a nice movie to follow with each character.  It was nice to watch a different story line from the traditional ones that are out there
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great family Flick, even baby friendly with vivid colors and great animation.  Excellent Script that does Dr. Seuss justice after the cat in the hat debacle.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book takes you through so many emotions! Loved it. I love the courage of the characters and the strength of their love for one another. My wish is for my daughter's to be loved by someone as much as Holder loves Sky!
B0053O89KG|5.0|If you love Castle - there's no reason not to buy it. The seasons only get better, and the fourth is definitely one of my favorites. Buy it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is the second book in The Kingkiller Chronicle and, just like the first, it's one of those books you can't tear yourself away from. Time truly flies by when reading it.
B002RXVOX0|5.0|This was the first truely romantic Dracula movie made. It gets the story across without drowning you in a sea of blood. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who is into vampire movies. However it is more of a chick flick.
B009GGWX5E|2.0|I bought this on vinyl in 1982. I was excited to hear it as I had seen this tour when it passed through Washington D.C. before I had heard Bolin play on Billy Cobham's Spectrum. It was the only live document of Purple with Bolin at the time. What a disappointment. I don't think this was much more than a final shot to capitalize on the Deep Purple brand. Seems to have been edited and mixed haphazardly. Bolin's playing is below par, especially on the Purple classics. If Purple had not had such a huge back catalog, this band could have survived on the new material. While an extremely talented guitarist, Bolin was not a good replacement for Blackmore. Anyway, the Tommy Bolin archives released the entire concert remixed some years ago re-titled \\"This Time Around.\\" It sounds and flows better, but is still nothing to write home about. The King Biscuit set is the definitive live set from this line up.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This is the usual campy fare produced by Depp. If was a decent movie but could have been much better. I can't help but get the feeling that the best parts of the movie were left on the cutting room floor. I would reccommend this movie to any one who just wanted some light entertainment but was not highly concerned with content. If you are a true dark shadows fan don't bother. The only comparison to the series are the names used.
0880793589|5.0|It's fun to get whacked with this pack of tips about creativity!  Thanks, Roger, for making it easy to learn.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It works great on my phone but can't get it to work on my Kindle or Nook. But I am stilling trying.
1401322786|5.0|I read this book on a friend's Nook - presumably to try out the Nook.  In one sitting, I inhaled the entire book!  Then I had to purchase my own copy, of course.  I'll read it again and again. Thanks, Mitch!  I was mesmerized by the story AND by the brain of the author who created the characters and story line.  Loved it!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I really enjoy the stations on Tunein radio. It offers music stations outside of the US. I like to switch my listening between different states. I can stay current on events like news & concerts in other cities. I like to listen to stations in Dallas, Chicago, Houston and Kansas Ciy.
140131046X|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  The way Mitch &#34;weaves&#34; the two stories together is beautiful.  I felt as if I knew the two men and was somehow living their lives with them.  Thanks, Mitch!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It was okay......There are other books on this subject that I have enjoyed a lot more.  I'm sure he was writing this for his scientist  friends and doctors who are not believers of heaven.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After seeing the movie the Hunger Games, I had the desire to read all three books in the series. If you liked the movie, or liked the &#34;hunger Games&#34; book, then you will certainly like any of the other Suzanne Collins books. This isn't a novel like &#34;War and Peace&#34;, but expect a fun, fast read of this book as you get wrapped up in the characters. Fun for all ages.
B00979CS50|5.0|Can't go wrong with Neil Young, add Crazy Horse makes it even better. Awesome new songs. Neil puts all he's got into his music.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|No problems at all. I love the cd, I listen to it almost every day. No problems with costumer service
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is more fun than we expected.  It is nice when you need something to do to fill a few minutes while relaxing.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it was the first ebook I read on the new kindle. It was a good read
B008C20TDG|5.0|While trying to switch to a paleo lifestyle, this is the book I keep going back to for my many questions.  The science is there and is written in an easily understandable way.  The recipes in the back are quick and easy but also varied enough to help someone through the first 30 days when it is tricky to determine &#34;what&#34; to eat.
B003JBHQP4|5.0|J'ai perdu mon câble pour télécharger les photos de mon appareil sur mon ordinateur. Cette solution est vraiment la plus simple, la plus économique, et la plus pratique que j'aie trouvée... Très satisfaite !
B00785P2QC|4.0|once u start u cant stop. this game is addicting. I downloaded it today and fang seem tl stop.<br />this is crazy
B005LAII62|5.0|Love this movie so much. Well worth the purchase. It's brilliant and creative! I'm just as big a Tim Burton fan as the next person, but if you're going to choose between this and Frankenweenie - choose this. It deserves the recognition.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|It's refreshing to see a movie about a marriage that has withstood the test of time, but with the reality that often comes with such a long relationship. My husband and I have been married for 36 years and tend to take each other for granted.  Watching &#34;Hope Springs&#34; provided a nudge to find ways to put the romantic spark back in our marriage.<br />Great acting, and it passed my &#34;test&#34; of a good drama: I laughed and had tears at various points while watching this movie!
0062200909|5.0|ABSOLUTELY buy this instead of the movie guide that's floating out there - this book is gorgeous, with a ton of photographs and sketches and just absolutely beautiful work featured inside it, with a lot of interesting details and commentary from those who worked on the film.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|....<br /><br />Most addicting game I've played in a long time spend hours playing this fun game<br />not just for kids even adults love to play this fun game
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack is absolutely amazing. So heartwrenching and beautiful and raw! I only wish that it was the FULL soundtrack, and not just the highlights. But I purchased it when it was featured for $5 as an MP3 download, so I guess I can't complain. Just would have loved to have the full album!
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I chose this ebook because I teach Chinese students and other international students. This book is very readable and gave me an insight in Chinese parents behavior
B007IXWL2C|4.0|good-finally brought everything to a finish.  I had read the first two books and needed to read this to bring everything together.
B000YADE04|4.0|I love both Brendan Fraser and Elishia Silverstone.  This is a very light hearted comedy with a moral story that reminds us some of the old fashion up bringing that seems to be somewhat forgotten in today's fast paced world.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Terrific book, kept my attention the entire time.  I would recommend this to everyone-had suspense, romance and couldn't put it down.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Love the songs, the story was ok.  I would recommend to people who grew up in the 80's and 90's, it's cheery, but really, the story could've been better.
0765325950|1.0|Like others, I'm rating this hard cover only release one star due to its delayed e-book.  This is the only way I can think of to encourage publishers to avoid this type of anti-reader decision.
1401216676|5.0|Purchased for a Christmas present and I could not have been more pleased. Cover and book are in gorgeous condition.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Really short wish it was longer but the book was good even though it kind of takes things from the previous books.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|I watched all 5 discs in this set. All the episodes were great. The stories are well written and suspenseful. The actors were all great, especially John Noble as Dr. Walter Bishop.<br />Blu-Ray DVD picture and stereo audio were much better that TV broadcast. The quality is excellent.<br />It is too bad the series will end soon in it's 5th season. This is my favorite TV series of all time.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Love this show.  Don't know why I didn't get into it before.  Glad Amazon is here to help us catch up!!!!
B0090EIILU|1.0|Im sorry, but this movie was good until he came to america. then it sucked, badly. Terrible. Borat is still his best piece.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked the book and really liked the ending. I highly recommend this book! Can't wait to see the movie!!
B009JBZH54|4.0|I waited a long time before i decided to get the Nolan Batman trilogy on Blu Ray. It was only a matter of time before this was to come out in a set. Solid 3 movies; Begins is a classic, while TDK is a great sequel and TDKR is also a solid way to close the story arch. I kinda wish they wouldve packaged it the way The Star Wars Saga on Blu Ray or Deadwood on Blu Ray is packaged, like a book with slots to store the Blu Rays compared to the plastic clips that look cheap. I also own a Back to The Future Blu Ray set that has this same cheap plastic clipping, and I already broke a couple of the clips on that! So be careful.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is one our most favorite Christmas Albums.  A good mix of traditional songs as well as some of her own.
B0076DELIG|4.0|As usual Harry Bosch finds himself in trouble with the &#34;Brass&#34; in a case that goes back several years.  The anti-hero always comes through.  Well written, great plot and wonderful read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. Easy and fun to use and relax while playing. I like it better than using real deck of cards.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game offers lots of quick and challenging games. great games like snake and air hockey. it offers a challenge for everyone
B000W93CHC|4.0|If you loved \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", you must read this sequel. Ken Follet brings history alive with a rich vibrancy.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Beautifully shot and enchanting, especially if you are an Austen fan. I highly recommend this movie if you like chick flicks, and/or classic movies.  This film has a modern feel because it is shot with beautiful color, yet it is set to the original time of the book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series has been great so far. So excited for the next book. It is a beautifully written romance story. If You liked fifty shades of gray, you will enjoy this too. The couple in this story have a steamy relationship and they both carry a lot of baggage to complicate it.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|My 7 yo son placed this item on his Amazon wishlist for Christmas. He seems to like storing his Legos inside and then taking them out to play on the mat. The four corners zip and unzip easily.
0786838655|5.0|great book - great prices!!! The students love this book.  Very well written for young people. They love reading aloud.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|this game was so awesome until i gat error message &quot;too many controls in layout manager&quot; and now i cant play!!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I couldn't agree more. As a nurse I am seeing first hand the devastating effects of how our diet can negatively affect our health. I tell everyone this is a must read. Well researched.
B000GWE44U|5.0|This movie is a classic and I am ashamed I hadn't seen it before. Jack Nicolson keep you at the edge of your seat until the end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game for all ages. only draw back is that when you run out of coins you need to purchase them.
0765325950|1.0|I'm am extremely unsatisfied by Kindle and TOR.  Why not release a kindle book?  Charge regular price for it.  Who cares!  I just want to read it now and not go to a book store.  That's why I bought my kindle.  I hope someone buys your book in hardback and pirates it ASAP because this is ridiculous!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|5 ++<br /><br />This might be the best book I have ever read in the fantasy realm.  It's hard to say, I feel bad displacing Tolkein and George RR Martin... But damn.<br /><br />Character is engrossing, story changes constantly in ways you cannot predict, the end is fabulous, I read the last couple chapters like 10 times to figure it all out.<br /><br />I love it.  I love his twist on magic, I love the characters, I love that the entire first book is just setting up the world and the main charcter, I cannot wait for the next books.  You don't know it until the end for all the action that occurs but this whole first book is basically just character development.<br /><br />Incredible.  Well written.  Perfect.<br /><br />If you read fantasy you have to read this book.

B009CCBCU4|4.0|The Hilander (The Rise of the Aztecs, Book 1) was very entertaining but a little farfetched. Had nothing to do with the real story of the Aztecs.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Reading A Christmas Carol via a Kindle app. on my Windows phone was convenient, and easy.  Couldn't have asked for anything better!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very unique, but makes sure that you have enough hints to get the point if you're having problems.  Has a lot of creativity has you progress through the game, but still holds true to the basic gooey concepts that make this game an original classic.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I really was enjoying this game and decided to pay for it. Then I get to the barn where u have to connect the car and every time I hit the hook it closes and I can't go any further. I want my money back!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Everyone should read this, whether they are an introvert or not because you undoubtedly know someone who is an introvert.  This will open your eyes if you read it all the way through.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|WAS FREE AND A GOOD SOLID PRODUCT TO HAVE. I HAVE USED IT SELDOM BUT IT SEEMS TO WORK FINE WITHOUT PROBLEMS.(GET THE PUN)
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|This movie is lots of fun, the whole family enjoyed it! My son watches it about 3 times a week.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I'TS GOOD FOR BEING FREE. IT HAS THE OPTION OF READING TO  YOU  AND PRINTED WORD FOR YOU TO READ. IT DOES HAVE SEARCH. IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO NAVIGATE TO WHERE YOU WANT IT TO GO TO.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Once again the devs at Rovio Entertainment have produced a fun Angry Birds game. The Star Wars theme adds an extra fun dimension to the game and the new characters and abilities that are given to the birds makes the generic Angry Birds game even more fun. If you liked the others you like this, and if you like Star Wars you'll love this too.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I LOVE MY FACEBOOK AND THIS MAKES IT EASY TO KEEP CURRENT WITH WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY KINDLE FIRE.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|While it's not as good as the first season it's still an enjoyable period drama set in the gorgeous Downton Abbey. If you enjoyed the first season by all means watch this one to see the story continue. The plot gets a bit more contrived at times and you may need some extra suspension of disbelief but if you just want to relax and enjoy the show then that's exactly what you'll do.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|My wife (who has never seen this movie), loved her Chrismas gift!  I have seen this movie a zillion times! I grew up w/ the Rat pack! Thanks for making my wife's Christmas!<br /><br /> A++ Transaction! would highly recommend!<br /><br /> John G.<br /> (Chicopee, MA)
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Men in Black 3 is a step up over MiB 2 and is a fun ride. It's well worth a watch and an escape for a few hours but don't expect cinematic genus, just good fun alien action - which if you know anything about the MiB series that's all you should be expecting.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|My wife & daughter have gotten me hooked on the Twilight saga!<br /><br /> A+ Transaction! would highly recommend!<br /><br /> a pleasure to do business with.<br /><br /> John G.<br /> (Chicopee, MA)
B003VANOFY|4.0|I just got mine a few weeks ago. Just now the ear pads are starting to break in making them more comfortable for prolonged use. At first I could only wear them for about 45 minutes then had to take them off to give my head a break.<br /><br />The microphone has great quality and the speakers are truly 7.1, but not sure if it is something with the game or the speakers, but sometimes the sound comes through as if it is a corridor. Either way I'm happy with the purchase.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very interesting game.  But can be a bit confusing at times. You do waste a lot of time making unproductive guesses.
B007EECSFA|5.0|One of Kate's best!  I don't know how I didn't see it coming, but I didn't!  Again, I was guessing almost to the very end.  Her stories always take me to another time, another place.  This is the stuff fairy tales are made of!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Fun game to play kids love it my wife likes to play lots of animal's to see.recommended for adults also .
1419701533|5.0|My 8 year old grandson was delighted to receive this set as a gift. He has read and re reads this series many times.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this series so much. We missed the original airing so we were able to get caught up before season 3 started.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|yet another stellar Pendergast book by Preston and Child, readers of the series will not be disappointed. that said this is definitely not a stand alone book.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|A wonderful album for Kelly Clarkson fans which reflects some of her finest accomplishments to date. It is a good album for individuals who want the great songs all in one album.  I personally enjoyed every song on the album and felt it was worth adding to my collection. I wished the album title wouldn't have included Chapter One but I get the concept they were implying of more awesome music to come from her in the future.
B00829GFZ0|5.0|One of my son's favorite bands.  He has been wanting this CD for so long.  He hasn't stopped playing it.  Even I love it.<br />Thanks.!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The ads are a bit aggravating but it is free after all. Fun, easy to use and a great time killer in airports.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Item received in great shape and quickly.Item received in great shape and quickly.  This description needs 13 more words so I am filling them in.  How stupid.
B002XZNHG4|1.0|We had trouble loading the movie. I actually couldn't finish watching it because the movie wouldnt load half way through it.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Raunchy, immature, and offensive. The comedic trifecta. I nearly pooped my pants from laughing. Highly recommended for those who are no easily offended and appreciate the kind of humor Seth McFarlane offers.
B000MV9026|5.0|My 2 year old Godson loved this movie! Any little kid would...I coupled it in a package with some penguin bath toys so his feet were happy all day and night. Great movie, great gift. My 5 year old female cousin loves it as well. Shoot, I loved it! Great for all ages haha
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Grabbed me by the heart from the beginning! I would recommend this book to anyone who is an animal lover! Being a fan of racing is a bonus too! Absolutely wonderful!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Bought this for my brother who needed a controller to go with his new PS3. He hasn't said a thing. For him, no complaints = all good. 2 thumbs up.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This album is spectacular! I love almost every track, and even the ones I'm not ecstatic for are still very good.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Bought this CD as a gift for my mom for CHirstmas. It was requested so she loved it upon opening. I love Adele as well and will be burning a copy of my mom's lovely gift in the near future. * gasp* did I say burn? I mean buy ;) Enjoy!<br /><br />Her sound puts you at a soulful ease. She hits the notes so easy and makes you feel like you can to in the shower. Yea, nope..not happening lol.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Loved this movie. It is a different take on an old idea. The animation, the humor, the moral... the characters... all well thought out, and very well executed. Loved!
B000IKNZMM|5.0|Hadn't seen it in years and am big George C. Scott fan.<br />A true epic - and enjoyable time and after.
B000IF47QA|5.0|I purchased this book to introduce two middle school girls to this classic child's literature.  I told them they would read it, initially, as fiction.  Then, in college, they would read it as literature.  Then, as adults they would read it for its spiritual truths.  The entire Chronicles of Narnia can be read from these perspectives, with differing emphasis in each book.
B0006J28BO|5.0|If you love Miyazaki films, this one is a must! It isn't my favorite, but that's through no fault of its own. (Just that Miyazaki is a genius.) It is cute and lovable, and perfect for kids and adults of all ages. I really loved it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome read!  I will definitely recommend!  I found myself tearing up for the characters.  I want another book about Holder!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|WOW WOW WOW !!!  ALWAYS SOOO GOOOD.  WAITING EAGERLY FOR ANYTHING FROM NELSON.<br />I WISH HE COULD HAVE TWO OR MORE BOOKS OUT A YEAR.  I'M IN LOVE WITH JOHN CORY AND PETER BRENNER!!!!
B00845PT18|3.0|Not as good as the first one!! It is worth a watch if you are sitting home doing nothing on a rainy day
B0083P1QUM|3.0|PATRICIA CORNWELL HAS GOTTEN LAZY.  IN THE PAST, I COULDN'T BEAR TO PUT HER BOOKS DOWN, BUT NOW, WHAT A YAWN
B008J34466|3.0|Enjoy Pink very much so this review was tough for me.  I was a little disappointed with the songs on this album.  I really only like 3 or 4 of the songs on the album.  Guess I was expecting another &#34;Funhouse&#34;, but got a harder rock &#34;Can't Take Me Home&#34;
B001NLKZUA|3.0|I picked up these books initially because I needed something to read on vacation and I had seen the movie preview and thought it might be something I would ,feel guilty about, but enjoy.<br />Overall I did enjoy them. Clare is an imaginative author even if the framework is a the same as all the other popular girly fantasy books out there. With City of Ashes Clare's writing improved and her characters gained a bit of depth. Overall these are good stories but I would not recommend them to someone who is not already a fan of the genera, and I wish I had stopped after the third book.<br />Go read: Divergent, Hunger Games, The Night Circus or anything by Robin McKinley or Anne McCaffery (if you lean in the scifi /geek fantasy direction a bit like I do)  first and come back to these when you run out ; )<br />Then again if you are reading this...you might be like me and once you start a story you read it through to the end. In which case, go for it!! BUT if you can (and I couldn't...even though I read the reviews) Stop at the third book at least for a bit..the story after that sort of backtracks and the writing falls apart again. I HIGHLY recommend reading &#34;The Night Circus&#34; instead!
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|If you are an 80's hairband fan, you'll Love this movie.  Lots of GREAT music and laughs.  All stereotypical characters were well played by the actors and a few surprises
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This was a very enjoyable and, yes, peculiar book. I saw another reviewer talk about it not being great reading on the Kindle, and I concur. Tough to see the photos and impossible to read the letters. Other than that, though, it was great!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I just knew that this book was going to end in a wedding and Christian saying he loved her too. Ahhh such a hopeless romantic!
6304806434|4.0|Nicholas Cage's accent is bad, but then he always sounds weird for a boy from Long Beach, CA. But when you add Cage's talent for action movies to the acting ability of John Malkovich as an intelligent, discerning yet scary as hell convict,and then throw in Steve Buscemi as an insightful serial killer and John Cusack as the gorgeous good guy, and then add an ending with awesome action scenes on the Vegas strip...well, it rarely gets more fun than that!
030788743X|5.0|All that needs to be said has been said already about this book; it is geek ecstasy in words. I just wanted to add to the star count, as it is well deserved.<br /><br />Great story, great dialogue, great trivia, just overall fantastic.<br /><br />Couldn't put it down once I picked it up, and I'm not much of a reader at all.<br /><br />If you're anything of a nerd (and really even if you aren't), this is a wonderful, sweet, epic tale. $10 for the paperback is a steal. This would make a great flick if it ever gets optioned ^^
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Although there is action right from the start the best part really centers around the farm. Video quality is only fair when you are accustomed to watching action movies in blu ray
0956031609|5.0|This was so much more than I anticipated and I LOVED IT, it's so subtly and realistic. I look forward to more from this author.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|Came exactly as described. It was smaller than I expected. Incredible detail and is pretty realistic. My Nephew loved it.
B007RTAR64|5.0|This was as a Christmas gift for a grand daughter. She loved it. It looks very nice and seems to be well made. She was happy with it, so we were happy with it.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Alanis' second album is what I consider to still be her masterpiece.  I love everything about this album, from the artwork, to the lyrics, and the music itself.  Every song sounds different and is worthy of repeated listens.  Put the album on, open up the booklet and read along.  She has a lot of great wisdom to share on this gem of a record.  Favorites are \\"Thank you\\"  \\"Heart of the House\\"  \\"That I would be Good\\" and \\"Front Row\\", but really everything is just excellent.  She plays around with what we would consider typical song structure as well, to what I believe great success.  I really don't consider myself an Alanis fan, but this album is simply amazing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is addictive. The only downside is that I wish I could change the layout colors, background, and cards. Other than that it's free so there's not much else to complain about.  I enjoy it.
B00008ENTJ|5.0|and while it's not my favorite album by them (I'm totally biased) I still really like it. This is where you'll hear all of their hits. The cover is amazing in such a big state. Obviously, listen to the band before you buy it. It's not everybody's thing. but it's mine. Very happy to add this to my collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am hooked on this game, I even play solitaire when I am watching TV. I have it on my computer, but I rather do in on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I rented this movie not really knowing what to expect, but I was completely blown away.  Tom Hardy is phenomenal.  Just as Heath Ledger terrified and astounded us with the Joker, Hardy's character development for Bane was complex and horrific.  This film took me on a roller coaster full of thrills and chills. I can't wait to watch it again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved this book. I have read many John Grisham's books. This has so many twist and turns. The ending was great.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|GREAT love it so cool. You should try it if you have not all ready. The creators are awesome. They are awesome at creating!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wonderful read. Great addition to my kindle. Havent been able to stop reading this book! I would highly recommend! Never really been a big fan of his books but this blows me away!
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd is a joyous ode to 80's action movies, and a fantastic adaptation of the early 2000 AD comic strips. Karl Urban is a fantastic Judge Dredd, but Olivia Thirlby steals the show as Anderson.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I loved it, cried laugh feel related. I'm a Donnie girl and now I like him even more. Such a nice human being. Like he say till we are 60+
0765325950|1.0|It's crazy to not have this book out on kindle. Charge me the same price or more for the kindle version and I would purchase it. It's a sad day.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I liked this game, it was fun to play just a little gore though. Probably not good for younger children
B0032FPVKE|5.0|This bag fits my new Nikon Coolpix P100  I have a place to the camera, the charger, batteries cables etc'. I love the way it has a place to hiold the camera on the belt and shoulder as well!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game works great on the kindle fire. It loads quickly and doesn't stutter while playing as it did on my ipod.ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie was beautiful and a phenomenom that deserves to be watched again and again. The cast all deserve to win awards for their exceptional work and everyone else that worked on this movie deserve just as much credit as well. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, and Anne Hathaway are given credit for being the stars of this film, but if I had to choose what I loved most about it, I have to say that Eddie Redmayne, who stars as Marius, a revolution leader, was the one that stole the show from the rest of the cast. Not only can he act incredibly well, but his voice was an amazing surprise as it was phenomonal and emotional. Buy this movie in order to see what I mean and you will be hooked just like I was. I have seen the movie several times now in the theater and I cannot get enough. I cannot wait for the dvd to arrive!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|SubwaySurfers is a fun, challenging game. I was introduced to it by one of my friends and can't put it down! I think it's a great solution to temple run, perhaps even better! I also love that it gives you the ability to log into Facebook to battle against other friends playing. Overall, this is a fun, challenging game and it's definitely worth the download.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Works great , it is great to go to this game everyday as it is not boring but very entertaining.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I much as I thought I could predict what would happen, never in a million years would I of guessed all that did happen
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My son wanted a calculator so bad and the handhelds well they just weren't working for him that well. This one is so clear and the size of the numbers are perfect for him thank you
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is amazing and if you liked any of the other books in the series you're going to love this one.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|This is a fun game to waste time with.  It has very good graphics, a nice interface and challenging levels.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good the hunger games was a fun book to read,I think they could of went into more detail during the games
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This version of Angry Birds is the best yet!  It has the same interface with some new twists on what the Birds can do, and it has very good theme alignment with the movie.  A lot of fun!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I love books that have time-travel situations.  This book is not a dsappointment.  I am 33% through the book and can't put it down,
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|great idea for a movie. good blend of sci-fi/mystery and the perfect cast. though joseph gordon levitt looking like bruce willis was a little freaky to me.
B008M34INW|5.0|I purchased this movie because it starred Mel Gibson (please separate the actor from his personal life).  While it started slow, with a stock chase scene, the pace increased rapidly.  Mel again shows what a consumate actor he is and he holds your attention completely throughout this interesting twist on a flawed character.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  I suggest putting aside preconceived notions and getting this terrific movie for a heartstopping adventure south of the border.
1603425381|5.0|This book is great. There are a variety of ways to make corners.<br />The best part of this book is that there are graphs. That is what I use to make borders.
B00A0L7PE8|1.0|on  the  for real, for  real it seems like Prince musically got kidnapped musically after the late 80's and lost what once made him a force back in the day. this song is boring and bland. vocally he sounds tired and lyrically while that was never one of his strengths,this is song's lyrical content is about as deep as a Jerry Springer final  thought.  this song is a 3rd tier reject of stuff he did it seemed in his sleep back in the 80's. the remix to this is better but then again it ain't saying much. good thing i saw this cat in his prime and peak back in the 80's or he might be seen and heard as one of the 10 most overrated acts ever. because to me from the studio side of things, its been about 25 years since he made anything that even sorta moved me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is the best book in the hunger games. It's more like a surprise every page you turn the best book I have ever read
B000W91RUG|5.0|Everything worked great. Seamless process as always. This part though is rather annoying. Makes me not want to rate products. If my review is five words then that is all I want to say.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I love Mark Walberg!! Glad to him play this role. I really enjoyed the movie. It kept me laughing and also had a good story I even wanted to cry towards the end. I wont ruin it in chase u haven't seen Ted. The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars because of by promotion of Ted and him being a Teddy bear my 4 year old wanted to watch. Of coarse he didn't but I wish they would have made it known how graphic it is and language. Otherwise great funny movie. Watch but not with kids under 16-18 yr old. :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was written beautifully. It was refreshing being able to connect to Charlie on such a deep level. It puts life into perspective.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My review is an all around great book with great detail I could really picture everything that was happening I didn't want the book to ever end . I loved the part where they announced they both win because they where about to eat the berries. I would recommend this book to everybody who loves to read can,t wait for the next book.
B000FC130E|5.0|This is the story of a simple ordinary man who because of an act of kindness,for doing the right thing.,has his life turned down side up.  He becomes a hero because a hero is what is needed.  In each situation he is placed he does the honorable thing.  The characters, from angel to senile earl, are the stuff of fantasy, but the setting, modern day London and then some, is .just a step away from reality.  An unforgetable morality tale.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am not sure what book I liked most in this series.  I hated to see this story end.  I will have to find a'm other series to start reading
0811874192|5.0|Such a cool book.  The popups are detailed and beautiful.  This would be a perfect Mother's day gift!!!  Highly recommend this product.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game to play to pass the time I give it 5 stars I play this game over n over time really fly buy when u play this game it got a lot of games
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Great movie! Joseph Gordon-Levitt is making a name for himself haven't watched a movie with him in it that I wasn't engrossed in. Highly recommend this movie
B000I3W1XS|4.0|I recently decided to watch the ST movies while on vacation.  The first two were free with my Prime membership, but to my surprise I had to pay for this one!  So, I love the movie - but did not like that it was the only one that I had to pay for.
B009CPES4I|5.0|I love movies that focus on aging and life after retirement.  This movie could have gone longer with more interesting character development, but for the time involved it was a great watch.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love Taylor Swift, i love her new album. i love her modern new twist to it. my opinion definately girly, not so much country. i dont care, still love it!
0385344228|5.0|If you don't want a page turner that you can't get out of don't read this book. Every part of this book is compelling to read and has great depth. The ending will make you gasp. It was impossible to see it coming. One of the best mystery books I've ever read.
B009ME47H2|1.0|This app really stinks. There is no way to adjust the record volume and you can barely hear the playback. I deleted it.
B004EPZ084|5.0|This movie had me laughing so hard and I loved Jennifer Aniston's character, she was nuts...hilarious!!<br />Great cast too..awesome!! A++
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|The people that made this movie spent ALOT of time and energy in getting the look and feel of the &#34;old&#34; Disney animation style to mesh with the 3D computer graphics technology of today.  The characters were perfect.  Story has great balance.  All-around a super movie.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|At first I didn't know if I would like it when I started the game, but I kept going on. It is lots of puzzle fun. You pretty much have to connect them together and even better if you get them on the stars. Its not to difficult but lots of entertainment.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My mother in law purchased me this DVD for Christmas because my husband had told her how much I was clogging up the queue! An inside joke between me and my husband because I add so much musicals to our Netflix queue and it annoys him when he's trying to watch his Breaking Bad episodes. Anyway, My first initial thought was this movie is going to be about singing baseball players! I was pleasantly surprised that I had the plot all wrong! I recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 13.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Despite having shipping issues with Amazon, this is a quality product.  I mean it's a kindle case so there really isn't much to review.  When you have it propped it is sturdy.  Haven't had it on a car trip or anything, but just sitting around it's good.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The plot of this book was good, not great, but definitely entertaining. I didn't care about the characters too much in this novel and the main character, Katniss, was really annoying in a lot of the book. It was a very fast paced read after the first few chapters.
B0052OZJQO|5.0|I saw the movie in the theatre and loved it. What a soul! Pina Bausch was the most brilliant coreographer.
B000GCFO0S|1.0|I got this movie because my bf wanted to go see the new one that just came out. After we watched this one we decided not to go see the new one. LOL
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and I can play anywhere that I can take my tablet fun for the whole family
B003274QH6|5.0|What a show!  Twists and turns in the plot-characters that have no redeming qualities but you get &#34;addicted&#34; to them, wondering what will happen next.  Great, great series.  You can't go wrong watching this.
1449410243|1.0|Don't even waste your money on this book. The author has no talent at all.  I would be surprised if he even has a cat!  The drawings are pathetic and the jokes are just plain lame, about at the eight year old level. If filth is what you are looking for, then this is the book for you.  Otherwise, pass it buy or you will be filled with regret.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Didn't know what to expect when we first started watching this show.  Each episode has a twist that we couldn't have expected, and we couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  Great writing, great directing and great acting.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|No one has brought a super hero to life like Chris Nolan! Dark Knight trilogy = five stars = best trilogy ever!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another good solid Grisham read. Not his best, but a good one. Interesting character and plot. Will read just about anything Grisham writes.
0061733199|5.0|Its a well rounded book, and definitely a must have.  If you're considering this for prepping, or simply camping and adding more information to your library then don't wait one more second and get it.  It will be worth it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Who doesn't love this show.  Anyone??? Anyone??? I didn't think so.  The next season is starting and this is a great way to catch up.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love this book because it's really funny.<br /> I think the author did a really good job on this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very easy to use, especially for maps, and accurate to my isolated area when I compare temp and wind conditions.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|First time reading a Baldacci book and loved it.  I will be looking for more titles to read from him.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|If you have any mental health background, this is a must-read. If you don't, then you have to be receptive and open to the depths of a demon infested mind of a child and that of the Mother who bore him.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|It sounds like you are at the concert - clapping at the end of songs.  Does not bother me at all.  I have no complaints with any of the performances.  The music is beautiful.  This comes with two discs.  You will love it!
0756666937|5.0|I gave my grandson this book for Christmas (he is really into Legos) after eating the Christmas meal he was found reading and exploring all the good things in the book.  He really enjoyed it.  He is 8 years old.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Cannot get enough of this series. Looking forward to the series return. Love every episode. My teenage son & I watch them together - great bonding session
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very good explanation of the neurological systems and processes when trying to explain what areas of the brain were or weren't functioning when he was having his NDE.
B0053O89IS|4.0|Another great season from those we have come to love on screen. Maybe lacking a little something (perhaps the sexual tension) now that they are officially a couple.
B005LAII80|5.0|For any fan of Judge Dredd, this is the film we've been waiting for. Finally, this flick is honestly perfect from the amazing portrayal Urban gives as Dredd, amd equal performances by Olivia Thirlby as Anderson, and Lena Heady, a villain that John Wagner would be proud of. The acting is complemented by an original story by Alex Garland and a breathtaking score by Paul Leonard Morgan that puts you in Mega-City one sonically. While the cinematography captures the grittiness of the future world.  I hope this film does so well on bluray/dvd sales. John Wagner loves this film, I love this film. And so will you.
B003L77G6A|5.0|A firm family favorite. Great to watch during non ratings season when there is absolute rubbish screened on free to air tv. Cannot get enough of this series.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Transformers is an awesome Trilogy, we love all the movies, nice addition to our collection, action packed and enjoyable for the whole family (a few beeps every now and then).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the third book. Wow, I haven't been able to put this one down. What's in store in the next one?
0937381888|4.0|Bought this for my husband, I should have bought a kit or supplies to make this a complete gift, but it's a start. Lots of info on what to do and how to do it, haven't brewed anything yet.
B007OWRBJK|1.0|This is one of the few books in my lifetime that I almost did not finish.  Boring like the comebacks he has attempted.
B00846REIS|1.0|I refrained from reading this book after the first few chapters when I realized it was glamorizing the gay lifestyle.  I am NOT interested in reading this kind of literature.  It saddens me to think the gay lifestyle is accepted as normal in our sinking society.  It's one thing to read a romance between a man and a woman, quite another to expose oneself to<br />something God abhores.
B007THA4FI|3.0|If she tried to have this trite little piece of fiction before her Harry Potter fame, I am sure it would have been rejected.  I expected something more and was left wanting.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Proof of Heaven<br /><br />The author didn't tell much more than what was in the description of the book.  He needed to go into more detail.
B001BC5HXG|4.0|I'm re-reading the classics of my youth.  This did not disappoint the second time around, in fact it got lovelier like love.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Saw the series, own the series, bought the book, started buying all the books on the subject.  I am a WWII history buff & military history & tactics major while in the military.  CAN'T get enough.  Great research and portrayals!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|iT TOOK ME ONE ENTIRE SUNDAY TO READ THIS BOOK AND A HALF BOX OF TISSUES!!  I WILL DEFINETLY READ MORE OF HER BOOKS
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Amazing read. I'm more in love with Gideon now than I was before and can't wait for the next book to come out.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This book was a really funny, exciting, enjoyable read.  I might have enjoyed it even more if I was more aware of Irish folklore, but you don't need to be in order to enjoy this book.  One of the scenes made me roll my eyes, but I'm probably more aware of the downside of pet overpopulation than most.  Even so, I was able to take it in the humour it was intended.  I'll be reading the next in this series for sure.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Played this on the Dreamcast. Nostalgia set in and it was enjoyable. Highly recommend downloading this game. nice job yo.
0765325950|5.0|great book loved it, dont pay attension to those fools who give one star because of no ebook. You should know that they do that to prevent people from torrenting ebooks on release day and hurting those who spent thier lifetimes writing brilliant books for us to read. 'punishing publishers' by giving 1 star is childish and is an insult o the legacy of the wheel of time. once again great conclusion to a truly epic series.
B009OXS8RQ|5.0|This is brilliant record I present to my dear friend.<br />Recommend it to all! This is amazing music for all time.
B008XCPO2Q|4.0|This movie actually sucked.......but who gives a crap about the story line or the technical crap when you have this group of men mostly naked!!! I sure don't!!
B004LM72ZY|5.0|I actually bought this toy to use as a cake topper for my son's 3rd birthday cake, not expecting much more than that. To my pleasant surprise, it has become one of his favorite toys! It's the ideal size for toddlers, about 8 inches tall and very lightweight. He loves to do a countdown, play pretend, and have adventures to space with the rocket and the included astronaut. It's a wonderful, simple toy that encourages lots of imagination.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It used the songs excellently. The singing was very good. A lot of fun and very entertaining. Loved being able to sing along to the sound track.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Have used BB on my laptop for about a year now have it on my Kindle Fire.  Great way to pass time.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I have watched both the foreign version and this one. Both are excellent adaptations. I loved the books and appreciate the screen writers following the book's story. Good strong acting also.
1594487154|2.0|I was disappointed with this book despite the positive reviews.  As an entrepreneur, I found it to be boring, shallow and very light on sales insights and psychology.  Chapter 7 on Pitches was way off the mark and would lead sales/business people in the wrong direction with quite a bit of misguided information.<br /><br />I bought this book because it had such a high review rating, and I was surprised to find that it not deliver for me on content .  I would never leave a negative comment unless I felt like others should be aware.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|My husband & I truly enjoyed this movie. Josh Brolin was an excellent young Tommy Lee Jones. Lots of fun and action and comedy. Good sequel/prequel.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Come on its Will Ferrell as an elf, what really needs to be said.....a future holiday classic!!! My kids love it.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|While I liked the book I thought there were three separate stories going on. I'm hoping it is a prequel to a new series......
B004749LO6|5.0|If you are a fan of beyonce, you will love this DVD. It's kind of set up like a story in song. I love it. She's an amazing singer and dancer.
B008PQ8XZK|3.0|I am not able to write a review for I have not finished the book  yet. I can say that it is a nice story full of flashbacks which makes you feel at a loss some times. This is a good option for a summer reading.<br />I enjoyed the way it is writen also.
B007FZ7QZA|4.0|I like the CD but I am not in love with it. I like about 50% of the songs, but forever a fan.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I got the book for my husband because he has liked other Dan Brown books.  He says &#34;A very interesting view of the secretive NSA.  Excitement on every page.  A wonderful ending!&#34;
B000O179A4|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. The singing is what grabs me to it. I highly recommend this movie.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This App allows my daughters to use their own imagination to make beautiful pictures, scenes and even stories.  Where most Apps they follow along or play a game this App helps them use their own creative abilities to express themselves.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME. I have my bedroom decorated in Titanic I HIGHLY recommend the seller and the product. I LOVE IT!
B004ASVS0E|5.0|I love her clear and timeless voice.  Several of the tracks bring tears to my eyes, they are so beautiful.  Annie Lennox at her best!  A new Christmas favorite!!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It's no Zoo Tycoon but it is still a good way to kill some time when you're sittin` other John.
B004R6JG7G|4.0|no problem with the package or the dvd when received. I gave as a gift and the person is enjoying it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Powerful food for thought. Do we each create our own silo. I look forward to reading more by this author and will refer him to my reader friends.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Kept me playing but game was too short. Worth $2.99 to continue playing to end. Games fun but notenough hidden object scenes if that is what you like to play.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun and some game a even hard so that's good. My kids love it and I love it!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|great continuation of the genre. Renner is a good choice to continue this tradition. I would like to see more.
140053271X|4.0|It is as good or better than a Kindle, but it does not have all the functionality for the PDF books.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Its not only entertaining but also teaches kids about decision making and hand eye coordination. I even enjoyed playing it.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|Love Stone Sour and haven't found too much that I don't enjoy. This is probably not their best but still a great album.
1451695195|3.0|I liked this book because Im very interested in the afterlife and paranormal. However, I found this book hard to read in the beginning because the author goes into great scientific detail about his illness. The man is intelligent, but the scientific terms and details lost me a bit. Although I can understand why he explained everything the way he did.<br /> I really liked that it was written by a Doctor. Someone who is more fact, and proof based in his thinking. I think this is important because if someone like him can experience this and change his views on life/death and the afterlife then that is remarkable! This was a life altering event for Eben Alexander.<br /> I wanted to read more about the experience and more details about the other side. I was hoping to hear more about the afterlife, God, past relatives, information he could have been given to help us here on Earth. I know that may be to much to ask for.. But I guess that would be my own personal 'want' if I had a NDE (which I hope I do not).<br /> Overall it was a good book as this was his experience about his journey to the other side, and what he witnessed and felt. Im happy he was allowed to come back to share this with us because many of us do want to know what is on the other side. Thank you!
B007HJHO2O|5.0|I recently looked at this album thru Amazon's recommendations.  Very interesting album, but it's awesome!  The highlight of the album is definitely the 6-part &#34;King of Number 33&#34; masterpiece.  Memo is also a great track, as is Me and My Downfall and Marty and the Magic Moose.  Maybe September leaves a little to be desired, but it's still not a bad tune.<br /><br />Keep it up DeeExpus, and I'll be looking forward to future albums from you!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This was a good film. If you like action/adventure and twists and turns, you'll like this flick. I know a lot of people have given it poor ratings, I suppose this is based on the new lead. I didn't really miss Damon. His in the film (you see a photograph of him) he just doesn't act.
0060254920|5.0|High Quality book.  Nice Printing, nice binding. No complaints!  And it is a classic &#34;children's book&#34;.  Everyone should add this book to their child's library
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is funny and sad and tragic and, dare I say it? Hopeful. Hopeful for those left behind.  Seriously well written.  Loved all the characters - they were so real.  As a parent, this got to me on many levels. Just read it...you will be glad you did.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This was my first effort at downloading a free book on my iPad .  It worked well, the book format was great.
034580404X|5.0|Can't say enough about this Triology of books.  i am not a book reader at all and have found I have read these books 2 times around both in less than 2 weeks.  I bought these for my sister-in-law as she had never read them but she really wanted to.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Good value for a decent camera backpack except for:<br />1. No rain cover<br />2. Not well padded all round<br />3. bag size can be bigger, currently only suit for ladies' back as this is like a kids bag on a guy
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Pretty funny.  Worth seeing, but not the funniest movie ever. And now, ten more words are required...  Three, two, one.
0765325950|5.0|How about we review the book rather than the publishers stance on the ebook. You're making it appear to people that the book itself is bad. If you're that stressed about the ebook, write a letter to the publisher, don't give a good book bad reviews.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Rich in depth, emotion and character development. A beautiful story of love, loss, family and friendship. Will read again and again.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Can never seem to put one of these books down. Mitch is probably the best character I've ever read. The twists never stop and every page makes you want to find out more. Waiting for the surprise return of his wife who never really died but was given a new identity. Any possibilities, Vince? :-)
B00447L4JG|5.0|I purchased the collectors edition for my son years ago! But it mysteriously disappeared from our house sadly. My niece who is 3 saw this movie one day on t.v and really enjoyed it she is a big fan of Halloween so I decided to buy it for her. She just loves it sings and dances and tells us all about Jack and Sally. It's a great movie I still enjoy watching it.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|it was fine until they started in with the new plot to scam the guy in the bar with a documentary - there was not enough connection made between that plot and the overall plot of the book until the very end and so it was hard to keep reading about the movie stuff with no idea of how it had anything to do with the big plot.  So that made it an unsatisfying read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Other than the not so great writing style (which I think has improved since the first book, however) and some cheesy repeated lines, the overall story filled that smutty fic hole inside of the fangirl in me.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This is a great read. side-splitting funny; lots of great lines to quote. Makes you feel like there is hope for this world.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Had some eh moments, but overall Ted was a funny flick with some really good lines that had me laughing hard.
B003L77G06|5.0|Funniest show on tv! If you're not watching it, you need to be! And you can buy past seasons and get caught up like I did.
030758836X|1.0|To put all of your talent and power into the first half of your book and exhibit such poor control of your book's end can be viewed as running out of steam or, even worse, premature ejaculation. The ending of this book is one of the most deflating examples of writing I have ever seen.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I though I would replace my  aging (but still excellent performing) E5, with this new version. I like the new &#34;equalizer&#34; settings on the E6, the lighter weight, and the indicator lights. The power slide/toggle switch eliminates the accidental shutdown that sometimes occurred when fat-fingering volume or equalizer controls on the E5. I would have given this unit 5 stars, but I am not yet a fan of the overall styling and the removable plastic clip. Absolutely amazing sound quality is what the E6 is all about, and it is constantly attached to one of my iPods my Sony MDR-V700DJ or Sennheiser HD-555.
B0087FMUCQ|2.0|While I find this game interesting for a short time, it lacks much of a game-play feel.  It would be more properly named Extreme Driving Range.  I don't see myself playing it again, and will likely delete it soon.
034580404X|5.0|The 2nd book is by far the best, but the others are good as well.  This package deal was the least expensive anywhere, and it arrived quickly.
0099519852|3.0|Interesting 'data' - actually examples. Some will find valuable.  To sum the theory up  &#34;Practice makes perfect&#34;  My grip is that<br />the supplied information does not actually prove the thesis.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow! this is the first of Jillian Micheals videos I have owned. I have ordered several more and I am awaiting their arrival now. This kicked my butt way more than a trip to the gym & i sure felt it the next day!
0399226907|5.0|We bought the hardback with the paper cover but quickly found little fingers should have the board book. We used the larger hardback for his first birthday as a guest signature book to leave a little note for Alex. He loves the board book and it is better because the holes are easier to feel and poke little fingers through. And mommy doesn't have to worry about pages or the cover getting torn! :)
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I purchased this CD for my 12 y/o son as a Christmas gift and he was so excited.  I even got it on video and he was thrilled and plays it constantly.
B003RV43X4|4.0|Overall this movie had a very classic plot line but the special effects quality and creative creatures made it better. Some decent acting from the main character and some supporting also helped. I liked the movie and may recommend it to my friends and family I think would be in to this sort of thing.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to this show! It is awesome! It's been hard to find a good tv series lately and we have watched an entire season in 4 days... because we were a bit behind.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Although Mirror, Mirror with Julia Roberts was better I still liked this movie and Charlize Theron carried it with her performance and outfits. Twilight star almost ruined it for me.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Cute application, I know nothing about music and could play an easy song quickly.  App was downloaded by children at a Christmas party and they really had a good time with it.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I think I liked this better than the other Snow White movie that came out recently. Julia did a great job (as usual) and it was interesting seeing her in a villain role. I would recommend this to my friends and family.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS HEART WRENCHING AND HEARTWARMING ALL AT THE SAME TIME. YOU COULD FEEL THE LOVE AND THE PAIN. THE CHARACTERS BECOME REAL AND YOU WAN  THE BOOK TO JUST GO ON..........
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. You can find all kinds of things on this site. Somethings you wouldnt even think of. Thanks for this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this book 3 times now and can't seem to get enough! Suzanne Collins, well done! Everyone loves this series and I can't find a reason not to love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Yes, I lived it... You can't just like or love this story, you have to live it. It's slightly terrifying reading a book and knowing that any second the bottom is going to give out into something heartbreaking. Even without all the buzz surrounding this book, you could just feel that something ugly was lurking. But this is a beautifully written story about survival and hope and love and it deserves to be lived. Another amazing book from Colleen Hoover!
B00684J49U|5.0|Waited seemingly forever to get this - not Amazon's fault, but mine. GLAD I did - this show continues to amaze and fascinate me. Terrific characters, enough changes to keep things interesting, and very, very well written! Make a perfect series for me.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It is rare to find a book that makes you smile,then laugh out loud, while your heart aches and you are teary eyed all at the same time.  Serious topic told with humor, generosity and grace, that has a ring of truth to it.  It was hard to put down, and I read it in practically one sitting.  Read it, you won't be disappointed.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Season One if not better... keep in mind these are the short British &#34;seasons&#34;, not the 28-episode models we have in the U.S. The acting is excellent (and I'm a true Basil Rathbone fan, so that's saying something!) and both Holmes and Watson are credible, creative and BRIGHT. I like this new interpretation of Holmes - no complaints at all! And since it's British - well, that just adds that little something special and more positive to it all!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I've reached over 358,000 points and think that is pretty great since I'm in my late 60's.  It is the only game I play outside of several versions of solitaire :)
B009Z8FUB2|3.0|Not at all what I expected for this film's soundtrack, but it's OK. There is a lack of originality overall, and some of the tracks are so short, you may feel a little cheated (as I did).
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been using this version of Spider for quite a while so it was a necessity when I just got my Kindle Fire.  My Galaxy III phone loves it too. :)
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I read these out of order (Gate House before it), so I was very pleased to get this one for my Kindle. DeMille rarely lets the reader down and that is true of this book - he develops his characters well, and this filled in gaps I had after &#34;Gate House&#34;. I like the way he works his plot and tension for nearly all they are worth, too! Very well done!
B0002O7XW2|5.0|so good and soooooo scary! we enjoyed it. my sons and i all watched this video together and were sitting on the edge of our swats. so stessed. and fun.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|And I've got all the seasons - this tops off the collection. This continues to be well-written, wonderfully acted, and generally one of the few shows that has lasted. I think it is one of the better series out there, and the 9th season was no exception. Now -- on to #10!!!
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|This movie was well worth the money. It had comedy. It had action. It just had everything I look for in a movie
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Since my new Kindle HD did not have a light to let me know that the battery was charged...I downloaded this app and its works great.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Best price!  All three films are there, and the person who received this gift was very happy for he had seen only the first film.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I disagree with some of the earlier negative reviews.  Maybe I'm not the fantasy purist that some readers are, but I thought book four was similar to the first three.  The characters are interesting and the plot moves at about the same pace.  I admit that when the author goes on and on about the clothing and food, I skim the information.  I almost didn't read book four because of the negative reviews, but I'm glad I did.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Our family watches this movie every year, but we only have it in vhs. So had to get it on a cd.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|As usual Baldacci captured my attention from the first paragraph. His characters are interesting and believeable, if somewhat super-heroish. At least I care about them and can't stop reading till I find out what happens to them. Keep them coming David, I'll keep reading.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Kik works really awesome!!!!!!!!!!! Now I can talk to my friends whenever I want. Sweet! But one little tiny thing, if u have a kindle fire, when u r changing your name, it keeps saying kik has stopped. Other than that I would say 5 stars
1451627289|5.0|I'm not finished with the book yet--I've been taking my time, savoring the story. The time travel aspect is a means of getting to an amazing story. The characters are believable, with the strengths and weaknesses we all have. And the history of the 1960s are brought to life via the fictional characters. It's simply a good book, one of my favorite reads in many years.<br /><br />Don't expect a horror novel because its not, although you'll feel scared, even terrified during certain scenes. It's just a darn good story that makes you think, \\"What if Kennedy wasn't assassinated?\\" \\"What if things had happened another way?\\" and \\"What if I had the power to go back and do some things over? What would I change, and what impact would that have on others?\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good story with a twist.
B009CG955Y|5.0|I really enjoyed it. The quality is great. I was never bored at a point in the movie like some movies I've seen and it really got me excited. It's a cute and funny movie too and the trees looked really fluffy. Watch it if you're into all those animated movies and such :D!
B004SBULWE|1.0|Did not work on my tablet I got. Would not work at all. Even tried re instaling it twice! Don't waist your time!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I remember the first day I bought Cut The Rope. Then when I got this it's like I relived the entire experience haha. I can't wait for more levels to come out. Just like Cut The Rope, it starts off very simple then progresses as it introduced new types and abilities of the pudding monster. I love how the game looks as well, the pudding monsters are adorable, in my opinion.<br />If you love/d Cut The Rope, I absolutely recommend this game as well :D!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not bad but don't waist your time if you are using it on a 7&#34; or smaller tablet device. Workst better on bigger tablets
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|this app is Great because it's simple and basic but has all necessary functions that an alarm clock needs. The dimmer function is a swipe motion so you have complete control. you can also choose what sound you want to wake up to with the option of downloading more sounds/songs. the weather is displayed but doesn't take over the screen.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read nearly all of Tom Clancy's fiction works, and Threat Vector ranks with the best of them. The continual high level of excitement, great action scenes and numerous twists in the plot put it on a par with \\"The Hunt For Red October.\\" The air to air combat scenes are particularly well done and realistic. The book's only drawback, and it is a small one, is that the reader must really stretch his imagination to accept the plausibility of a few of the final action scenes. However, the momentum of the plot carries it past this section with no real problem.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could read this book over and over again. I now knew what all the hype was about this book and the rest capture you from the beginning to the end and I can't wait to start the last book of the series and to see the movies but I know for sure that the books will be better then the movies
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Kind of sad but reminds you life doesn't always have happy endings, but it's what you learn from the past and overcome the bad.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book for kids and teens. Lots of suspense and always wanting to read more of the book. Really good
B00APUQT7I|2.0|The movie was good but the stream locked up half way through the movie. This has happened to me two out of the last 3 movies I have rented from amazon. It's not my system since I stream Netflix all the time and it has never locked up.
B0002MB7QW|4.0|Though this film was made in 2004 and too few people realized the implications of Writer/Director Roland Emmerich's sci-fi fantasy as being in many ways a call to attention of the ignoring of the global climate due to our interference with the natural aspects of this planet, watching it again in 2013, with the backlashes of the hideous hurricanes and ice storms and the tsunamis and the drought and the hottest year on record being 2012, hopefully will provide a bit more serious look at the concept THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW offers. Yes, it is exaggerated for impact and the visual effects tend to take over the personal stories that lie so closely under the surface, but watch it and think.  This is where we likely are headed - or something very like it.<br /><br />Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a Paleoclimatologist stationed in the Antarctica where he finds that a sheet of ice the size of Rhode Island has sheared off. `Our climate is fragile. At the rate we're polluting the environment and burning fossil fuels, the ice caps will soon disappear.' Concurrently the planet is witnessing severe weather changes - and Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York with friend Laura (Emmy Rossum) and others when enduring an endless rainstorm they witness a massive tidal wave in addition to freezing cold temperatures that could possibly kill them.  In the background is Sam's physician mother (Sela Ward) who brings a sense of personal agony to the realization that the world is heading for a next Ice Age. From there the story is a matter of Jack's swearing to save his son trapped in the Library in New York and warning the President (Perry Blake) to take his head out of the sand and realize that the extermination of the human race is possible if evacuations South are not begun. How it ends is predictable and makes the film too shallow, but the message is strong and one we must all heed.<br /><br />The special effects are extraordinarily fine and the cast delivers the sub-stories with skill. Yes, it can be viewed as corny and overblown and a bit on the sanguine side, but the point of the film is well worth our serious attention. Just reflect on the events of the past year and the few years before that and try to deny that we are indeed harming our environment and future.  Grady Harp, January 13ill.

0765325950|1.0|Since I don't buy books to fill a library, I'm disappointed not to have this on the Kindle as a release. Why hold back (money?) and not support those who prefer to have their library in a convenient place? Authors and publishers need to rethink this.

B005PK553C|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this because it was a quirky twist on typical ghost schlock stories.  We wouldn't suggest it for young teens because of sexually explicit language.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I bought my first computer in 1981, and have worked since then building and servicing PC's and networks.  In all that time, I never heard of Anker, but the previous review sold me on trying them out.<br /><br />I particularly bought it to provide, in a Windows 8 machine, a second network feed for a Hyper-V virtual 'client' machine.  Normally, with only one physical Ethernet connection, doing so would disable the Ethernet connection on the 'host' machine.<br />However, with this little device, I can hook up, via a spare USB 3 port, another physical Ethernet RJ-45 network connection, which can then be sacrificed on the 'host' machine to provide network service to the 'client' machine.  Thus, both the 'host' and the 'client' both can have Ethernet, even Internet, network connections.
B004L49K20|5.0|This was purchased as a birthday gift. It is a great deal! It was an excellent price and came on time and in perfect condition. I highly recommend this product and seller.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Some of the scientific jargon was a bit too much for me. It was a good book. I guess it gets credence because a scientist wrote it?  I'm not good with non fiction. It was decent reading. However if you already believe in life after death this is just validation for science
B002BI6SMI|3.0|Liam Neeson is entertaining, but the story is very much a typical formula. Worth watching if you are in the mood to see the good guy win at the end and do not want to put a lot of thought into a movie.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This was my first (and last) Scarpetta novel. The storyline was okay, but Kay Scarpetta's constant, disjointed internal conversations were just too irritating for me.

B008220C56|4.0|Tolstoy's novel is a multi-faceted work of tragedy and comparisons between lust and love, but more than that, it is about how forgiveness and faith transform lives. In many ways, this adaptation is a visual masterpiece and brilliant artistic achievement. It gambles mightily in its metaphors by limiting most of the indoor scenes into an old theater, thus reminding us that all men (and women) are simply \\"players on a stage.\\" When I first heard of this approach I thought it would be a disaster and severely limit the scope; instead, it is an intriguing twist that constantly surprises and engages its audience. The costuming is scrumptious and the acting is phenomenal, particularly from its leading lady. Unexpectedly, aspects of it are also fraught with humor, which brings much-needed levity into the seriousness of the subject matter. The score is sometimes demure and at other times perfectly suits the mood.<br /><br />Where its faults lie are in its utter absence of the religious themes of the book. Though we do get to see the forgiveness of Karenin (and indeed, his are some of the best scenes) and how her own self-doubt and hatred eat away at Anna, the roles of Levin and Kitty are so reduced that it leaves us wondering why they are involved in the first place. The book's purpose is to show us wild, passionate, sexual desire in an extra-marital love affair, that turns itself inside out and descends into jealousy and contempt, contrasting it with a pure and innocent love that begins with an act of total forgiveness. But... that isn't in this version, and as a result, Levin's transformation is also absent. What we are left with is an incomplete story that does hit some of the highlights of the moral messages of the book but not the most important ones.<br /><br />Much of the adaptation is masterful but I did miss some of the more impacting moments in the story -- like the contrast between the birth of Anna's child and Kitty's. However empty as it may be, it does invoke in a viewer a sense of deep compassion toward this broken, sinful woman in desperate need of loving kindness.

B00AMS38YU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. Though some would no doubt say it is predictable. It still a movie to pass a few hours.
B005BX3NAA|4.0|Being the Greatest Hits it is full of good songs all in one place. Some of the songs I had on tape and did not have the cd for them like the ones from T2. Over all not sure what else should have been on it.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Great book...easy to read on the go. Glad I took the chance and downloaded it.  Recommend everyone takes the time to read it!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|the acting was done well, but the story line was a little dry. the video feed was good. i would not watch it again.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've always been interested in Kennedy, and also a huge nerd. This put the two together in a perfect combo, and I couldn't be happier with the result

B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Since the mid 1980s I've probably reread Getting to Yes a dozen times, just to keep my negotiating tools in good working order.  It is the best self help, management skills book that I've ever read.  The principals and techniques in Getting To Yes can be used in almost any situation where two or more people are presented with a problem that requires solid communications and a final outcome that the parties believe \\"is the best decision/best deal that we could have reached\\"...and the process was fair.  This book really came to mind after witnessing the negotiating ineptness of the White House and the Congress during the recent \\"Fiscal Cliff\\" fiasco,  in which all parties were focusing on their own political positions rather than clearly defining and tackling the real issues at hand. In fact, this book should be required reading by all folks on Capitol Hill.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|so classy. so much drama. so interesting the class disparity. I never want this show to end. Its amazingg gggg
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I had problems with an older version, but the latest seems to have fixed that. My favorite KB once again!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love this calendar it is really is good for a quick glance and not a lot of flare.  It lets me see what is going on for the whole month at a glance.  This calendar really works for me and I have tried a few of them.  so far this one is my favorite
B005LAIIKI|5.0|As an avid fan of Quentin Tarantino, there's a level of quality that I expect from each film that he makes. I expect to connect with his characters, but not necessarily like any of them. I expect to see a film that satisfies the film geek in me. More than anything, I expect to see a film that entertains throughout the prerequisite bloated running time.<br /><br />\\"Django Unchained\\" is nearly three hours long. But it never feels that long, it entertains and surprises every step along the way. When I first checked my watch, we were already two hours into the film. All of Tarantino's films are usually about this long. Tarantino has been having fun with fictionalizing historical periods lately. This started with 2009's \\"Inglourious Basterds\\", which was easily one of the best films of that year. My eighty-something year old grandmother, who lived through the time that the film depicted - World War II - said that if events actually happened as they did in that film, that we would be living in a better world today. I think that's a pretty high compliment, especially since my grandmother is not Tarantino's target audience. He was able to design a great story - not an idealistic view of that time period, but still a pretty fascinating one.<br /><br />\\"Django\\" is about slavery...a taboo subject in any film, a strangely popular one, recently, as the same time period is explored in \\"Lincoln\\". It's about Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is bought and then freed by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz, one-upping himself from the fantastic performance he gave in \\"Basterds\\"), a dentist turned bounty hunter. White supremacist slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) bought and enslaved his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), and Django and Schultz are out to correct the grave injustice done to both of them, and this doesn't mean just capturing and killing Candie, but many others who are responsible for the trauma experienced by Broomhilda.<br /><br />Christoph Waltz has got to beone of the finest living actors in Hollywood. He's incredibly charismatic, but he cares about his character, first and foremost. As the prime antagonist in \\"Basterds\\", he was positively horrifying. In this film, he's the hero, but at the same time, he's anything but that. He brings humor and depth to a character that wouldn't have worked this well otherwise. Jamie Foxx does a good job as well, but I don't necessarily see him winning anything this Oscar season.<br /><br />I'm half-tempted to call \\"Django\\" Quentin Tarantino's superhero movie. Django is by no means that, he's an oppressed figure with no real \\"super powers\\", however he's a kick-ass guy who the audience roots for from the very beginning. He even has his own theme song! We don't know how he appears to be more literate than other slaves, and he is somehow always able to outsmart those around him.<br /><br />\\"Django\\" shows Tarantino having slightly more respect for genre than he ever has. It's a western revenge epic, first and foremost. It's also kind of a comedy, with some of the most clever dialogue I've heard in a film in 2012. It's also a romance, displaying the forbidden love between Django and his wife. But it's first and foremost a western, and Tarantino sticks to that.<br /><br />This film isn't perfect, however. One thing I expect from Tarantino is well-developed strong female characters. We don't have that in \\"Django\\". I was hoping that Kerry Washington, who is also badass protagonist Olivia Pope in ABC's \\"Scandal\\", would be smart and strong-willed enough to get herself out of the problems which are out of her hands. I was hoping for Tarantino to give her some snappy dialogue, to show that her character is, like Django, superior to all of the other slaves around her. She isn't. She just kind of stands there and whimpers. She's helpless, and I wasn't expecting that from Tarantino, who has written some of the best female protagonists in film.<br /><br />Other than this, \\"Django Unchained\\" is a masterful film. It takes alot for a nearly three hour long film to be engaging the entire way through, and it is. It's wickedly funny, and at the same time, extremely dramatic. With its graphic violence and filthy mouth, it isn't for the faint of heart. All of the actors here, especially DiCaprio, seem to be having tons of fun here, and it shows. Tarantino loves to fictionalize history, and if such films are as good as \\"Django Unchained\\", I think he should keep doing it. It's a vision of history that only Tarantino can bring us.<br /><br />Grade: A-
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this on my Kindle alot to make less complicated recipes on Pinterest if I don't feel like taking out my laptop.  The IPhone is too small and this is perfectly in between!
B0041KKYDI|5.0|Excellent director and acting.  The soundtrack is also very well done.  The movie builds tension throughout and even though I already knew how it ended, I was on the edge of my seat.<br />Some slightly grisly scenes are a little tough to watch, but the story is not focused on the gore, but rather the change in Aron Ralston as he ponders his past and future.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|if youre a chick you may like it<br />otherwise pretty boring and  not recommended.<br />can i get my 3 bucks back?
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love all of his books.  This one was a really good read.  I didn't put it down until I finished it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The BOOK was fast paced and filled with a plethora of lovable and interesting characters.  I would recommend it for young people and for those who are still young at heart.
0345803485|3.0|I don't agree with some of the previous reviews that you either love it or hate it. I thought this book was mediocre. It's not very well written and the story line isn't all that interesting either yet something about it made me want to read more. Christian Grey made me want to read more. I didn't care about the sex or the luxurious life style he led I wanted to know about his past, just like the main character Ana did. I would recommend reading this book if you have nothing else to do or are just curious to see what all the hype is about the book. Definitely gives you something to talk about.
B004VRK436|4.0|My boys ages 8-14 love this movie, great family film. Filled with action, adventure, suspense, what more can boys ask for!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was such a good book. It kept me hanging on till the last letter. I would read this book again. I felt like I was in the arena with katniss the whole time. BEST BOOK EVER!!!
B004SGWYVA|5.0|If you like zombies, anime, action, comedy our any combination of the four then this collection is for you. Great visuals and sounds and transitions smooth from episode to episode
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Bourdain is such a genuinely compelling writer, his prose as richly composed as his food. Will now be gifting a copy to the cook in my life.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Starts with the President that began to shape the 21st century.  I consider myself a history buff, yet found all kinds of new critically important information that dramatically shaped the world we currently live in.  I have gained a new respect for some of our presidents and a further disdain for one of them.  If you pass on this book you will miss significant knowledge of the actions that are the world we live in.
160094048X|5.0|This cookbook has really improved my life! The idea of vegan baking seemed overwhelming at first. But this book saved me! It is filled with easy and delicious recipes that will please everyone. Several of my non-vegan friends love all of the cookies I have made for them. I highly recommend all of Isa's cookbooks. She makes vegan cooking easy, fun, and very delicious.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It does what it's supposed. The settings are nice too being able to dim the lights is pretty neat. If you need an alarm get it!
B0069P0DU2|5.0|Item arrived as described by seller and in a timely manner. Plus this thing makes Darth Vader shaped ice cubes, how freaking awesome is that. Great for anyone who is a fan of Star Wars and cold beverages!
B008476HBM|4.0|One of my favorite books. The realization of the truth set them free to love. Oh Mr. Darcy, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Darcy!
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Went to see the concert when they aired it in theaters and it was a great experience. This nice little 2 pack CD is a great way to keep living that experience on a day to day basis from the comfort of my car or home. Only thing that could make it better was if I had been able to see it live.
159514188X|5.0|I picked this book up and wasn't able to put it down. It has an amazing plot, storyline, characters, and an awesome setting. This book leaves you wanting more.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The whole family loved it! Recommend it for all ages.  We watched with a 7 year old to a 75 year old.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Open this book and enter the medieval world of young Thorngrin,the youngest of four brothers living in a small village of commoners. However, as you will soon discover, there is nothing common about him. I felt as though I was sharing his desires, his setbacks, his joy, his sorrow, his love gained and love lost as I journeyed with him on his quest through this magical world. I became a Morgan Rice fan after reading Arena One and Two. I now count her among my favorite authors and look forward to the release of the next books in both of these series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app.  The way the functions work together is just brilliant.  The web clipper is my favorite component.
B000LJAEFG|5.0|Natalie Woods last movie. Good flick. Ahead of it's time back then in the 80's. She and Chris Walken and Robert Wagner were on the boat celebrating the wrap of this movie, when Ms. Wood &#34;drowned.&#34; Sad.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|I first came across this watching Showtime's &#34;The Untold History of the United States&#34; episode &#34;Bush and Clinton: Squandered Peace-New World Order&#34; and since I've lived through all that and much more, I don't trust politics, politicians or the Whitehouse. I've dug into the dirt behind some of the &#34;official&#34; propaganda and so far they have hit the nail on the head everytime. But since Stone got JFK so wrong on crucual points, to be honest I was hesitant to buy the companion book, I will verify what I can but...knowing the lies, dishonesty and lack of integrity that exists in politics and in Washington, DC in particular, this all &#34;feels&#34; correct. I reread the Watergate tape transcripts again and it shows just how, for the lack of a better word, corrupt the ethics, morals and scrupples Washington, DC are. I loved the &#34;dated&#34; respones many politicians have said about this mini-series...calling it communism and such. That just tells me it's the truth when something gets such a caustic reception like that. That's ok, I made a list of their names and am looking into their backgrounds too. :-)
B0035HKWM6|5.0|This movie was one of my all-time favorites as a kid and nothing could stop me from finally getting it on DVD. Jim Carrey plays a great character, mostly crazy as usual, but the film has a interesting plot and romantic tie, making this one of Carrey's memorable performances.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I waited a while for this movie to come out. I found  it to ba a quality movie and really enjoyed the younger K.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|This was an after Christmas selection and is such a great addition to my collection. Service was extremely speedy! Thanks!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have watched supernatural since it started and have enjoyed every season.  When it started the 8th season cable vision didn't run channel 11 so I missed supernatural and vampire diaries.  I was happy that amazon had the shows I missed, but 1.99 is a lot of money for one show.  Not only that the shows I missed were repeated in December 2012.  I didn't notice until after I paid  $6.00 for the 3 episodes that they were repeated in dec. which I taped.  I will be more careful next time.  Amazon should charge $1.00 per episode.  It would be  cheaper to wait and buy the whole series then just episodes.  Well anyway I enjoy Supernatural  and I rate the series 5 stars.
6305754969|1.0|When I received the movie I was stupid and did not double check what was inside so when my husband opened it for christmas and we went to watch it the move that was actually inside was different. Instead of being El Dorado with John Wayne...it was actually the cartoon movie &#34;road to El Dorado&#34;
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again Vince Flynn has produced a masterful quick hitting book.  Cover to cover enjoyable.  Waiting impatiently for his next book.
B004GYY714|4.0|I love all the varieties to fit any listening mood. My son loves the Beatles stations. I love the classic rock  and oldies. No hard rock but moderate to soft 70's and 80's. I use it on my K.F. H.D. and my Cricket Android. Works excellent on both. Like i said only complaint is buffering issue.
B0053O89IS|5.0|This season isn't their best but I am enjoying the family dynamic between Bones & Booth.  The ending is interesting as well.  Can't wait to buy season 8.
0143117009|5.0|incredible read, some of the ideas are complex and I had to read them over a few times before I could fully appreciate them, but all on par with GG&S
B002DQLGHU|1.0|It wasnt the movies fault it was the kindle.  Download error!?! Very frustrating since we were counting on it for a road trip
B002UM5BXW|3.0|I know that this chef is rough around the edges. This book is no different. There is some questionable material that you should expect from this personality. The writing is very matter-of-fact and not scholarly. The book is more for someone who would prefer to pass some time reading.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I don't like games that require you to purchase items in order to play. If I had understood that I would not have downloaded Wonder Zoo. The little bit that I did get to play seemed all right. The graphics are nice.
B0012GMW7A|4.0|Title says it all.  Glad to have this in my collection - though it is 2nd tier compared to later works.
144235545X|5.0|As usual - Vince Flynn is awesome.  Ten discs of excellence.  Made the road trip fly by.  I wanted to keep driving just so I could keep listening.
B0085W09ME|5.0|I feel happy interacting  with this app. I think is good to know the right place to analyse differentes options for my vacations.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I don't like to promote stuff in my time where I do not get paid but my kids really enjoyed this movie.  The graphics were superb and the teaching that old laws need to change was necessary.  Also endorsed was the idea that family is important.  Untypical of Disney and Hollywood.<br />We need more like this.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|It is a good app for me. I can listen and learn updates topics for the best  speakers and executive people.<br />I love it.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|The Blu Ray was not working but the DVD did.  A good movie though not outstanding or superb.  Many of the characters were duplicated and not enough work was done to conceal this eg. I noticed one of the bird smugglers in many different roles - surely they don't all look alike.<br /><br />The songs and dance was great as was the colors.  Should have had a little more on the Rio Carnival.
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|I'd seen the Home Alone movies many times, but after a recent New York trip (at Thanksgiving), it was fun to watch this film and see the sites again that we'd just visited.  Great movie with a great lesson at the end.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I read a lot.  And enjoy almost everything I read so maybe I'm a bad \\"critic\\", but this was the best book i've read in a long time.  For the first time in a long time, I woke up Sunday morning and couldn't wait to start reading again.  I literally couldn't put it down.  I loved the sensuality between Holder and Sky.  It was such a sweet and sexy love story!<br />I agree with a few of the complaints of previous reviews, mainly that Six and Breckin were such big characters and made the book fun, but then they were completely absent curing the climax and ending of the story.  I understand why, but felt like something big was missing.  I also felt like the chacter development of Karen was lacking a little along with their relationship.  Sky spoke a lot about her mother and their relationship but I do wish we were able to witness a little mors of their relationship.<br />other than those 2 points, this book was fantastic.  I laughed and cried and really enjoyed the deeper meaning behind the story.  The love story was perfect and the small revelations along the was were pleasantly surprising and unexpected!<br />I'm afraid to read anymore of her books because I feel like there's no way another could match up!<br />Absolutely loved it! ...only reason it's not 5-star is the minimal lack of depth, but that really didn't hinder the enjoyment of the book for me whatsoever!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|A great app, this one makes picture-taking with a Kindle a breeze!  I didn't know when I bought the Kindle that it didn't contain photo software, so I was very relieved to find that I had the option of downloading this, at no cost.
B0091REZMW|4.0|decided I would give it a try after watching a friend obsess over it day in and day out. The more I play the more I like it
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|This movie is intense and gripping making you share the fear of these three kids who get in over their head with a drug cartel. The bond between these three helps them to deal with insurmountable odds but is it enough to save their lives? You decide, and you will decide!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I think every lesbian has had a straight crush and can relate to this movie. I couldn't stop watching it.  You can't help getting sucked in and rooting for these two women, they are destined to be together.  There is something sweet about their love that gets me every time.
159420411X|5.0|I had known about this book for a few months already when a family member gave me this book around the holidays. I instantly put on that 'Thanks but this book will probably not be read' face on and put the book on my desk. Fast forward a few weeks and I completely regret that original thought. I was expecting this book would be only for people who are ecstatic about predictive sciences and statistics but this book has a little bit of everything for everybody and is an interesting read as a whole.<br />Recommend 5/5 stars
B0086700CM|5.0|This game keeps you on your toes which is good for me and my coordination. Fun to play and the grand kids love it. Would recommend.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie was worth watching once. There were no typical BW moments. The ending became obvious a little to early in the movie.
B0051XJ9YE|5.0|It is really good quality. I didn't expected it to be so good. my child loves it and plays whole day only with this toys
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Works on my HTC Rezound and Asus Infinity tablet. The game is easy enough for my kids to play and have fun but challenging for me to try and get all 3 stars.
B0051XI9FO|5.0|It is really good quality. I didn't expected it to be so good. my child loves it and plays whole day only with this toys
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I like the simple interface and multiple ways to solve the levels. My goal is to solve each of the levels multiple ways to get each of the achievement trophies.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Awesome book, couldn't ask for more. In my case I saw Sean Penn's movie first and then read the book and wow, both are totally recommended. The book is simply genius, the way in which all the information was tracked down should receive reverences.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Love the cover, love my kindle!!<br />It is everything and more than I expected!<br />Hope it lasts a long time!
B008M721MS|1.0|I tried to download Skype on my Kindle Fire (not an HD) and it said it couldn't download on it.  I am very disappointed.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom presents an interesting persective on life. A must read for anyone feeling too pressed for time to &#34;smell the flowers.&#34;
B0055S348W|2.0|It works, but having to have other software installed on a computer on the network is cumbersome. Google Cloud Print is much faster and more stable. (And cheaper)
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I had heard this was super funny and it was not good and was really not funny at all.  I was disappointed.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|Well worth reading. Glad I got it! I think you would like it if interested in sports and a heartwarming story of finding a sister (born without legs) Moceanu never knew she had.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|We had seen this movie in the theater.  I knew it was good and our daughter wants to watch it again.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I did not like this movie because I felt it went way overboard on the cursing. Way way overboard past where it was funny. I guess I was expecting more from what I saw on the advertisements. The last fifteen to twenty minutes started to get better and I enjoyed the end of the movie. Would not recomend this to anyone. Almost total Disappointment.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Homeland Season 1 starts slow, but each episode becomes more interesting. Worth the investment of time. I'm hooked and ready for season 2!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It had plenty of humor, making me laugh aloud several times. Particularly from the skilled comedic timing of \\"Fat Amy\\" played by Rebel Wilson, who I adore. The singing was well done, and though the storyline is a bit cheesy and predictable, it was a fun ride nonetheless.
B006ZCWTZG|5.0|Double vinyl-sounds great. Bonus CD is perfect for the car but there is nothing like listening to the Boss on record.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|This series is genius.  Every character is so well developed and I find myself feeling empathy, shock, anger, and affection for Walt and his family and all of his new &#34;acquaintances&#34;.  I'm so happy I bought the series and I find myself watching two or three episodes in one sitting when I have the time.  This is a superb series so unlike anything else.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. Have gotten so many ideas for decorating my house and tried so many of the recipes. It is fun to make boards and to see what other people like and follow. I like it better than Facebook..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!  I didn't buy into the hype at first but so glad I finally did!  Onto book #2!!!!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|My grandkids play the games on my Kindle. They like angry birds and have fun playing. It is a cute game.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not Grisham's best work.  Difficult to get into, not a plausable storyline.  Seemed rushed and just written for the money.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|We very rarely play this version. They do not like it as much as the other versions of the game.
B008602KQI|5.0|Lived up to all the hype and other reviews.  Setup the story nicely and good action.  Hope we never come to this int he future!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was not dissapointed at the final book.  All three books kept me entertained and I hated to put the book down.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|So refreshing to be reaffirmed that love is a choice and that we can overcome our own pride to speak love to our spouse as!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I love that it has so many levels! This game is so fun, I can't stop playing it!
B0009UC810|5.0|If you love the original SNL cast you must see this movie. John and Dan were my favorites. They always made my night.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Too much repetitious information on Yemen politics and terrain.  Does not have the interesting plot characteristics of previous DeMille books.  A disappointment.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We love this series! A lot of action and suspense:-) The fight for survival is so very intense it almost makes you feel a part of it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really really liked CH's other books, but I LOVED this one!  Not what I expected, but that's probably why I loved it so much. This book is predictable, yet not. I am still trying to reconcile fiction vs non in this story. I'm a fan CH!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read, it is romantic but thrilling at the same time and will keep you on your toes!. Would recommend to anyone!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I always enjoy this game no matter which one I choose. This game is fun and challenging to every age.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Actually, I have not read this book yet, so I have no opinion.  I have heard good things about it.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I didn't get to see this in it's Blu-ray quality goodness, but I was able to see a 'haji copy.'  I'm deployed right now, and I've got my preordered copy of Halo 4 Limited Edition sitting in my mail box stateside.  I'm drowning in my own antsy excitement waiting to play the darn game.  (Yeah, yeah, 'I should be doing my job,' but I've got enough time to take a breather every now and then.)  The movie is good and it does a great job of surprising the viewer because of this.  I thought it would be another low-budget live action video game commercial, but it turned out to be quite immersive.  You can tell that they didn't have enough money to make it super believable.  For instance, the CGI for the...<br /><br />---Minor Spoiler---<br /><br />...various Covenant species could have been better, but it was still pretty darn well done.  They did an amazing job at getting my heart racing by making them huge, powerful aliens that I'd never really experienced before.  I think the Chief's armor could have been better as well as the skinny, untrained look of all the cadets, which may have been on purpose; these are just preferences.<br /><br />This basically told a small story leading up to the awakening of the Master Chief at the beginning of Halo 4, which I have not played, so it was a fantastic teaser.  A Staff Sergeant who's never played a Halo game or read any of the books watched it before I did and he loved it.  I have a copy of the Halo 4 Xbox Magazine with the Halo timeline in it here, and he sat down and read that magazine for an hour straight; he's like 35, so there's some proof that even if you're not a Halo fan, you could enjoy this.<br /><br />Maaaaan, I wish they would just make one really good two to three hour Halo film.  I mean REALLY good.  If they disappoint me at all with a movie, it would suck.  That may be the reason they haven't made one, yet - fear of failure.  Anyways, buy this!
B000W93CHC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, it really is a page turner, I couldn't put it down. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because i think it is a little drawn out. However, I would definitely recommend this book for all lovers of historical fiction.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Well written, well cast and directed.  Scaaaaarrrryyyy.  Season one is equally impressive.  My wife and I get a little sad the closer we get to the end of each season.  We hate it when we run out of episodes.
B009GENZKS|4.0|I have enjoyed these animated resident evil movies more and more. COnsidering this is the second one. Amazon provided great quality in streaming it.
B0094K1K42|4.0|I don't generally enjoy movies that leave you feeling down at the end (like this one does).  Although this movie does just that, it was still a good movie.  Charlize Theron does a great job of portraying the main character in this movie.  Just don't expect a happy ending where everything is tied up neatly and everyone is happy.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was a very well written novel, and I recommend it for 5th grade and up. Some of the vocab was a little difficult. Otherwise, this is a great book for children, and I bet some adults would enjoy it also. Enjoy!!!

B008D28HYS|4.0|I've loved Paint-by-number puzzels for years.  The graphics and game play are well done.<br /><br />Just a few minor things that stop me giving it 5 stars:<br /><br />First, even minor interruptions such as phone calls and notifications (both out of my control) cause CrossMe to restart, forgetting what you were looking at, your undo list, etc.<br /><br />Next, on large boards, the buttons to show the numbers aren't always there, don't always work, and sometimes tapping them end up changing the board.<br /><br />Finally, not all of the puzzles have unique answers.  CrossMe seems to accept any valid solution, but at times this has left me wondering if I've missed something else.

0812984412|2.0|Very much like the work of Tarantino, this novel displays a very large talent who has not yet found anything significant to say, and relies on \\"meta\\" devices and big ideas to impress the audience.  It's hard to believe that this has been received as a serious and rather difficult novel, when it is nothing more than a few reasonably competent stories and a pretentious structure.  \\"Black Swan Green,\\" a rich  and surprising semi-autobiographical book about adolescence, is not perfect, but it establishes much better ground to consider Mitchell a serious writer, and not just a flashy entertainer.<br /><br />I suppose one could produce a work which achieves what is said of this book--the linking of disparate narratives, in different genres, taking place in different eras, which somehow reflect on one another and build to a grand and overarching statement.  But Mitchell doesn't come close to doing this.  The main theme of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is noir writ large: exploitation, violence, conspiracy.  (This kind of paranoia has supported many major works of fiction, though whether it has enhanced them is another matter. )  Mitchell takes a long view of this grim idea: the development of \\"civilization\\" is a story of rapacity and evil and will lead to disaster.  He develops this theme through six stories set in different eras that are \\"linked\\" through a few stylistic tics and narrative contrivances, and then shoehorned into a pointlessly pretentious ABCDEFEDCBA structure.  The stories are neither as different as he implies (all but one are essentially good-guy/bad guy thrillers) nor as deep as he needs them to be.  The book is not difficult to read (except for the excruciating middle section), but the reader's memory is taxed by the long interlude between parts one and two of each of the first five stories.<br /><br />Three of the stories are close to very good, though they would have benefited from rethinking and revision.  The letters from a rebellious young composer in the 1920s are beautifully written, and the novel brings music to life in an imaginative and unexpected way--Mitchell does for music what Joyce Cary does for painting in \\"The Horse's Mouth.\\"  This section of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" seems closest to the author's real talents. But it evolves into an unconvincing account of unrequited love, and its tragic ending is inexplicable.  Also, its plot and themes are so different from the other five stories that it is hard to tell why it is in this novel. The pulp eco-thriller set in the 1970s is a rather good example of its type, with reasonably well developed characters and well-executed double and triple crosses.  It's the least pretentious and most successful of the six pieces.  Mitchell could probably do this for a living, if he wanted to.  The sci-fi narration about a dystopian future has an interesting premise, developed with clever detail and a lot of narrative drive; while it eventually wore out its welcome, I enjoyed most of it and was surprised by its surprise ending.<br /><br />There is less to be said for the other three stories.  The writing in the nineteenth-century South Sea narrative is decent pastiche, but the underlying plot and characters are unbelievable, and it makes its thematic points with a sledgehammer.  The Amis imitation about a contemporary publisher trapped in a nursing home is a trivial jape, not very amusing, and its plot is absurd.  There is some inventiveness to the central story, set in the far future, when advanced civilization has collapsed, and the survivors in Hawaii have reverted to tribalism, with memories of the past enshrined in myth.  They receive a visitor from a more advanced society, echoing the first story in the South Seas, and again raising the specter of colonialism. Unfortunately the narrator is given a cloying sub-Faulknerian faux-naive voice that set my teeth on edge.  I felt that I was in Dogpatch, not on the Big Island.  A struggle to get through.<br /><br />I suppose I ought to comment on thevarious ways in which these stories are linked through detail and motif and even plot to imply that the story of man is one big horrible story, but most of them are  rather silly and mechanical.  (There's a lot of talk about recurrence, and each story includes a character with a comet birthmark on the shoulder. Oy. )  Four stories do echo one another thematically--the eco-thriller and the three stories set in the past and the future--but if anything that trivializes them, giving you the feeling that Mitchell has found various ways to say the same thing.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" has a secondary theme unrelated to its big idea--the perennial power of narrative in shaping our identity.  Each of the stories except the last one is read in some way by a character in the next story in sequence.  The two stories set in the future comment a lot on history and tradition.  And there is a bit of explicit discussion about the art of narrative.<br /><br />Mitchell is clearly a gifted storyteller, with a wide range of tools and an acute eye and ear.  All of his tales move swiftly (they have to--they're quite short).  Still, this novel vividly illustrates the downside of \\"story-telling\\" as a model for fiction:  the piling on of coincidences and reversals, the assembly of various strands into a tidy ending, the failure to develop character because the plot takes priority, the use of gratuitous detail to enhance the \\"significance\\" of the story.  Despite his skill with language, his encyclopedic knowledge and curiosity, his wit, his elan, Mitchell's work here tends to peter out, as plot contrivances take over.  I started flipping pages to get to the end of each section. The same was true when I read his most recent novel, a tale of traders in Japan, which opens with a bang, sets the scene very well, and disintegrates into a distasteful and implausible suspense story.<br /><br />Mitchell seems uneasily poised between the skills and aspirations of literary fiction and the methods of pulp and genre fiction.  It will be interesting to see how he develops.  When he's at his best, he can do anything.  But on balance I was bored and disappointed by \\"Cloud Atlas.\\"

Helen Mirren, who transforms herself into Prospera - Miranda's mom instead of her normally misogynistic dad - is an intriguing twist on Shakespeare's classic that works well.  The entire production maintains the integrity of the Bard's language and plot sequencing. Bravo - or should that be Brava!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn hit it out of the park with The Last Man!!  This was Mitch Rapp on steroids.  Mr Flynn did a masterful job bring in many of the past characters, Kennedy, Hurley, and Nash.

Extreame Measures and now The Last Man are my favorite in his Mitch Rapp series.  I highly recommend The Last Man.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I've been using a Fiio E5 at work for about a year, and had generally been pleased with it. I had a need to buy a second for home, and thought I'd poke around the other Fiio amps, maybe looking for the next step up.<br /><br />I found it.<br /><br />If I was \\"pleased\\" with the E5, then I'm bouncing around the room with glee with the E6! (note, I listen mostly to Goa/Psy-Trance, YMMV with other genres of music)<br /><br />The amp sounds deeper, flatter, punchier and, it gets LOUDER (without the hiss side effects that the E5 is prone to).<br /><br />The multi-EQ is a nice step up from the bass-boost on the E5. There are two EQ curves and a third setting with attenuates the input by 3db, thus allowing for hotter signals at the input.<br /><br />- EQ1 gives a 5db boost from 20-80hz, then a \\"slow sine\\" down to where you'll find a -3db drop out around 3.5Khz.<br />- EQ2 gives a 2db boost starting at 20hz, +3 at 50hz, then again a \\"slow sine\\" down to where you'll find a -2db drop out around 3.5Khz.<br />- EQ3 is the 3db attenuation setting<br /><br />I love this little guy - the E5 is being sent home, the E6 is now my primary amp at work and travel.

159420411X|5.0|Hard to say anything bad about this book. If you want to understand more about why and how predictions fail and how to think about that, I have never read a better book.    While there is a lot of detail and math that can be boring and dry, Silver's book seems remarkably well written given the nature of the topic and the sheer length of the case he makes.    Suffice to say \\"predictions are hard, especially when about the future\\" but that doesn't stop most of the world most of the time from doing just that with ridiculous confidence that is usually way wrong.    Poker, Politics, Economics, Climate Change and a lot in between. Great read and great information for the healthy skeptic.    A pretty good summary of the book is here:    [...]
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Wes Anderson has a beautiful fingerprint. His films are always creative, quirky, and touching. Moonrise Kingdom is another example of the wonderful films he makes.
B004B4V19K|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed by this set. The characters I found hard to follow from film to film, and they are too often busy with marginal maneuvering around Australian chicks than fighting the Japanese. OK that is part of the story of the Pacific war, but I feel too much time has been devoted here to peripheral aspects of the campaign.<br /><br />The rhetoric is a bit excessive, to the points where it detracts from the overall credibility of the work.<br /><br />Special effects are also OK, could have been better with available technology for sure.<br /><br />In the end one is left wondering: is this a fictional account, in which case it is too convoluted and lack focus? Or is it a historical rendering of the war, in which case there is too much that is left out?<br /><br />Overall still worth watching but don't expect too much in terms of either a good story (like for Band of brothers) or a good documentary.<br /><br />The extra DVD on Peleliu is mostly a few interviews with veterans. OK but a series like this should have devoted much more to this pivotal battle, second only to Iwo Jima and Okinawa for the Pacific war.

B00A6I87UQ|2.0|Although I am not having the same problem as many others seem to have with it not loading on the Kindle reader, this works great for my on my iPad 2 w/Kindle app. Also for the comments regarding no night mode for Kindle app, I use rubylith on my iPad which works quite well.<br /><br />What I find disappointing is the quality of the eBook. I have the printed version. This is a great reference to have whilst observing.<br /><br />The eBook version appears to be nothing more than a poorly scanned copy of the original spiral-bound book. Zooming in on any of the charts shows this pretty quickly. Detail is lost when attempting to zoom in practically making it useless. What would have made this an awesome eBook is to have all the charts as vector graphic images thus zoom and scale would be superior.<br /><br />Also, there are NO links at all in the reference. Constellation, stars and other DSO entries should have links to the chart pages. Would make navigating this eBook a great feature but alas, that is not to be the case here. There is SO much potential to this being a great and proper eBook.<br /><br />While I highly recommend the printed version of this book I cannot in good conscience recommend this eBook. Stick with the printed version, you'll be much happier.<br /><br />Jim West<br />President, Colorado Springs Astronomical Society

0316232955|4.0|What I Liked: 1) I loved the style in which it was written. Because it is a journal, we are hearing it read aloud from Carson's journal after everything happened. So not only are we hearing what went on during the day, but Carson gets to add his own commentary, and think about what went on and what he did or could have done differently. It's a rare thing to find in books, at least among the books I read, and I really enjoyed that voice. 2) The humor. I found myself laughing out loud at many parts of this story, and going back and repeating some of the funnier parts to other people. For a story that has a rather dramatic twist, the humor breaks up the monotony and hardships that Carson is experiencing throughout his senior year of high school. This alone is reason enough to read Struck by Lightening. 3) Malerie. Carson's...best friend. I say that hesitantly because Carson really acts as if he has no friends, yet Malerie is by his side pretty much every step of the way. Knowing that Rebel Wilson plays this role in the movie makes it even better. It was really easy to picture her doing and saying some of the things that Malerie says in the book. 4) This is the first and probably only time I'll ever say this: The Unreliable Narrator. How much stock can you put in a journal? Do you think he doesn't add his own embellishments in his journal? Or remember things the way he wanted to remember them? But it made the story seem all the more real, just knowing that we were only getting a skewed version of the story. I'll likely never say that again, but it worked in this instance.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like: Okay, who actually curses that much? Especially in a journal? I know that people use curse words, but isn't the whole point kind of to make a point? Like, you feel so strongly about something that regular words just won't do? I personally would prefer no cursing in books, but that's probably never going to happen. But why did he have to use it as often as he did in his journal? For a kid who was as smart as he was, I think it was unnecessary, and untrue to who his character was. Hey Carson, you want to be a writer? You need a stronger vocabulary.<br /><br /> Overall Thoughts: Struck by Lightning is one of those books that everyone should read once. There was a great message (no, not the one about blackmailing your peers), but about making the best out of life no matter what its thrown at you. The comedic relief was awesome, and the ending was heartbreaking. If you are bothered by curse words, you should be prepared for a lot, but if that isn't something that is an issue, then don't worry. Chris Colfer's first foray into young adult fiction is a success, and I can't wait to see it on the big screen!urnal?

Not really sure what to say about the overall experience as the review should be a little further into the gameplay. I give it a five  because of the refreshing spin on the typical game app. It's nice to experience something that uses a creativity and imagination to keep me interested. Hopefully as the game progresses the puzzles will get more difficult.

I really felt like I was living Charlie's life instead of just reading about it. I wish it wasn't so fragmented, however, because I found that it made it more difficult to read. This is the kind of book that needs to be read at least twice to fully appreciate it's depth and meaning.

B005LAIIKI|4.0|.<br /><br />Django Unchained is supposedly a very loose reworking Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti western Django. I believe it has a closer affiliation to the exploitation cult film Mandingo (1975) about a slave taught to fight other slaves – this movie for its time was somewhat an outrageous product, a film that Mr Tarantino has praised, while by and large the critics' have rejected the film with extreme disapproval.<br /><br />The lead actor is played by Foxx, who plays the Django, a slave who is in a chain gang, across their path comes one Dr King Schultz, a German who is well-groomed and rather unconventional in his ways, he claims to be a travelling dentist; Schultz carriage is a small wagon with a huge model of a molar tooth on the top. Our Shultz, after some initial reluctance from the slavers, buys Django and promises him his freedom in return for a favour: he needs Django to help him track three white fugitives that have a bounty on their heads.<br /><br />As the narrative progress, we find that Django proves himself a good assistant and a talented shot. Through some back story, we find that Django was married and his wife speaks the German language and she was named Br&uuml;nnhilde, unfortunately, her current owners mishear her name and call her &#34;Broomhilda&#34;. Due to her predilection for running away, she is branded on the face and forced to work as a &#34;comfort&#34; girl. As mutual respect sets in between the eccentric German and Django, it is agreed that that will rescue his wife Br&uuml;nnhilde.<br /><br />Through the story, we meet inept KKK posse the characters are somewhat reminiscent of the KKK in Blazing Saddles. We then meet with Candie (played rather eloquently by DiCaprio) the owner of Candyland Plantation his evil is only matched by his apparent need to sound and look charming. Django needs all his guile to pretend to be that of the most hated of things, a &#34;Mandingo&#34;, a fighter-promoter his double dealing is only matched to Stephen's domestic bondage to his master and his family, aptly played Samuel Jackson.<br /><br />There are moments of pure brilliant direction mastery of the rather over the top violence and I feel the overuse of the N-word, was not needed. At two hours and 45 Django is a long film - undoubtedly, this film better than Tarantino’s WW2 film Inglourious Basterds. The relationship between Schultz and Django is well managed and their friendship really looks convincing and their resulting comedic episodes are well done. Well, worth a four-star rating – with flaws.<br /><br />.​mestic bondage to his master and his family, aptly played Samuel Jackson.<br /><br />There are moments of pure brilliant direction mastery of the rather over the top violence and I feel the overuse of the N-word, was not needed.

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|This soundtrack is incredible; I have found myself either nearly brought to tears or laughing and/or singing loudly along with every song. I've heard many other versions of Les Mis before, and I really like how the actors interpreted their roles in this version and some of the liberties they took with the songs and notes. It's a fresh take, and so beautiful!<br /><br />However, be aware that is is only &#34;HIGHLIGHTS from the Motion Picture Soundtrack.&#34; If you liked Little People, A Little Fall of Rain, Cosette's part of In My Life, and some other songs from the show, you'll have to find them elsewhere. I was a little disappointed to discover they were omitted from the soundtrack--especially more popular classics such as &#34;A Little Fall of Rain,&#34; which was absolutely heartbreaking!<br /><br />I understand that Les Mis is an opera--that is, nearly every single word is sung--and so it would be somewhat cumbersome to attempt and include EVERY SONG from the show/movie onto one soundtrack. However, it would've been nice to get a few more songs!<br /><br />That said, the songs that WERE included were still of stellar quality :)
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|They don't make movies quite like this anymore, for the most part.  In fact, the intriguing style of camera work used in this film perhaps has never been repeated where it worked quite so well.<br />I loved everything about this movie:  the character development, the interesting and unique plot of the film, the camera work, the lighting, the lessons leared, the ending, and I could go on.<br />The only thing I don't know is why it took me so long to view the film.  I had been hearing about it all my life - my uncle speaks about it frequently.  I vividly remember my aunts and uncle sitting down to view it together on VHS when I was about 10, and having a discussion afterward.  The movie was assigned for me to watch as part of a college class.  But I found it so good that I bought the Blu-ray online immediately after the class was over and can't wait to watch it again with my husband.<br />I read a lot of the other reviews before writing my opinion.  It's frustrating when the reviewers are openly admitting they think the movie is good, but are rating the movie a 1 star simply because they disagree with it being associated with being the best movie of all time.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Victor Hugo is a writer I have admired for his compassion and human rights advocacy ever since I was in my 20s. I read the entire novel in German and English several times but I always come back to it. Now that the musical has been turned into a movie, it's time to read it on a modern reading device - the Kindle. Should be interesting once again.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|I didn't think I would like this as much as I did having seen the old classic so many times but after watching it I was pleasantly surprised and would watch it again.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I enjoy books which have an interesting plot, fascinating characters with well-written, sparkling prose. This one has it all. Thank you Courtney Milan!
B003VS0CXS|5.0|If you've forgotten how heartwarming this movie is, watch it again, with your own children or grandchildren.  It is the perfect movie for your youngsters to enjoy with lots of laughs and toe-tapping songs.  Plus you will enjoy watching it yourself again and watching them watching it.  Flying cars are the best!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan is a great writer and I enjoy reading his books. I thoroughly enjoyed the first Percy Jackson series and find &#34;The Heroes of Olympus&#34; series even better. This story kept up with those before it. You find humor, action, clean banter, and as always a cliff hanger at the end. Can't wait for October 2013 and the next book.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|It was okay, but I felt it was &#34;over-billed&#34; in the ads; it didn't really &#34;do it&#34; for me--just okay.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|While I purchased all three of JG's recent books, this is the first one in years that grabbed me (a writer and translator) enough to want to keep going. Reading it on the new Kindle has also been a very pleasant experience. This is written in a riveting style reminiscet of The Firm and will hopefully provide material for a new movie. I'm glad JG found his passion again.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|We own the Bourne trilogy and this one didn't disappoint. Our entire family enjoyed it and will watch over and over again.
B009C7JS14|5.0|The weather is always there instantly on my Kindle Fire HD.  When you want to know more, it's also there.  Great app.
B004N6369Y|4.0|great story but too simple, not enough action or drama. The beginning was boring but the end got a little more interesting.  Not up to  her writing standards
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I can finally stop crying...what a story! Romance, adventure, inventive... characters that matter and make a difference. Made me proud of what I have and those I love. Makes you rethink everything.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|The subject is crucial to maintaining a strong relationship in a marriage. I recommend the movie to anyone, but especially any who are experiencing a growing-apart in their marriage.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|You can't say too much about a band that has been around as long as I've been alive. The oldest stuff is obviously their best and this is one great collection to rock out to.
034580404X|3.0|These books were a good read but didn't really hold my attention. The scenes depicted seemed more and more of the same.
B005USZML4|5.0|This is a very cute story; an easy read.  It is a little different from many/most of John Grisham's books.
0316228532|2.0|After the wonderful Potter series this was a letdown to me. It moved so slowly and I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. I picked  it up and read a little and put it down again until I finally finished it. So mundane and I had looked forward to a new series from Rowling.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|like everyone says its fast! overclocked nicely to 4.0 on stock voltage. I have no need to go faster and want it to run a little cooler anyways. no complaints.<br /><br />Just buy it already and quite reading all the 5 star reviews.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Not recommended for under the age of 15.  Is a great show I even liked to watch it with my teenage daughters.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I actually really like this app. It makes taking pictures on the Kindle quite easy. As the camera faces the user, the Kindle camera is a little tricky to use, but this app has proven very helpful. I haven't had any problems with it and do not understand why some reviewers gave it such a low rating. Of course, I shoot professional quality photographs on SLR cameras and consider this more of a fun tool and would never use it as my main photography tool.
B006O3MU96|1.0|Prepare to be frustrated by impossible situations. i guess you're expected to just keep doing it over and over to finally find one outcome hat doesn't burn you.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I downloaded the latest drivers from [...] instead of using the mini CD that comes with the adapter.  With the latest drivers the ethernet adapter immediately worked flawlessly.  Initial transfer speed measurements show around 110M/sec.<br /><br />I will update the review once I have a few weeks of experience to judge the stability of the adapter.<br /><br />First Update after one week and tens of gigabytes of transferred data: I had some issues with the Adapter connecting as USB 2.0 when plugged into a hub before the hub was plugged into the laptop.  After connecting the adapter to a different port of the USB 3.0 hub (switching it from the \\"second\\" to the \\"first\\" logical hub) the problems disappeared and since then the adapter runs stable.<br /><br />Once or twice I had the problem that the adapter basically disconnected (all LEDs dark, no further network traffic going through, but still listed on the USB bus) after plugging in and out several devices at the hub, but I am not sure if that issue is from the hub or the adapter. In any case, a simple disconnect/reconnect fixed it.<br /><br />Second update after five weeks: Overall the adapter is still performing well.  There is the occasional situation where it is not properly recognized or where the network connection stops working, but a plug/unplug cycle always fixes that.<br />The adapter seems to have one major drawback:  I can't get it to properly work in IPv6 mode.  Neither local nor global (manual or automatic) IPv6 addresses work.  Other USB adapters and the WiFi card work properly, so this is not an issue with my Macbook.  I hope that future drivers will fix this problem.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|The cast for this television series is fantastic!  The series is extremely fast-paced and goes from one peril to the next with each episode.  I did not see this series when it was on television but I now own all eight seasons and love each episode!  Homeland and Person of Interest are in the same genre and are also very exciting series.  If you like thrillers, political intrigue and action shows you can't beat &#34;24&#34;---I can feel my blood pressure increase just watching it even when I know they will not kill off the main character in the series each week.  My reviews for each of the seasons of this series is identical to this one--enjoy!
B003E2UQMS|4.0|I wanted to read this book prior to watching the movie. Great decision. Great book. I finished it in a day.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it and can't wait to read the next one!  I felt as though it was well written and kept my interest.
B00A0A6F7C|2.0|Susan Boyle has an amazing instrument: Her voice. This record makes her sound shrill and overproduced. Not for me. She should stick to the more basic production evident on her initial recording of that Les Miz song she did so well.
B005EJNAO0|3.0|OK, but seen too many with too little real plot like this one and would like something with a new plot
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I was expecting a little more out of this movie.  The ending was predictable but overall worth the watch for sure.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD!  I have the complete season 1.  Season 2 will be available on DVD August 27, 2013.  The series of \\"Homeland\\", \\"Person of Interest\\" and \\"24\\" are addicting!  Each of these series is action-packed, with surprises in each episode, great acting and directing and contains enough true events to make you paranoid about who the good guys and who are the bad guys in today's real world--quality productions that will keep you glued to the television screen wanting to know what will happen next.  Claire Danes played in the hit fantasy movie \\"Stardust\\" and it was the first time I had seen her--she is very believable in the parts she plays.  I recommend this series highly for people who enjoy thrillers and action shows.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I chose this rating because it was an excellent movie, and because it loses nothing on the small screen. I have seen this on the big screen and thoroughly enjoyed it, and on DVD it was just as delightful.
1119962846|3.0|This provided a decent introduction to R but didn't really provide enough specifics about regression analysis, which is what I was primarily looking to use R for.  Also I found clarity and specifics about some of the command formats a bit lacking.  Like so many guides, this book is probably fine if you already have some experience with R, but is less valuable for the fresh young starter.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|This is not supported on the kindle fire hd. We can however buy the paid versions. Thanks for the tease amazon.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|no words to describe this movie. love the extended version you see clips not in the original cut. i love the movie i have to watch it a number of times. makes you wish it was real
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Overall it was a well written and acted movie.  Charlize Theron was the best thing from the movie her portrayal of the queen was spot on.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked this book, but did not find it to be great writing. The plot moves along and is suspenseful enough. The characters are reasonably well written, but the reader is not drawn to sympathize with the characters. I can't be more specific, but something is lacking in the character development.<br />I do like the way Flynn took her time revealing the true nature of the \\"heroine\\" in the story. I did not see the first one coming, although that does explain the girlish nature of the diary entries, which had me wondering whether I wanted to keep reading.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Such a fun game me and my mother all the time and have a lot of fun with it we play it again and again and again and again and again and again all day 24-7.
B00076RT24|5.0|The kids love and watch these movies all the time.  They were in great condition too.  Glad we decided to purchase.
B004QX07G4|3.0|The book wasn't what I expected but I ended up liking it. I love Ellen's show so I decided to read. Ellen had me laughing throughout the book.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|not as exciting as the preview seemed to low budget but thats my opinion rent it first to see if you like it or not
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book. I really enjoyed reading it and I cannot wait for the movie to come out so that I can see the story in person :)
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Love it! The movie was watched over and over simply to listen to the music. I love this soundtrack and I would purchase it agaion!
B009CGYO0K|2.0|In some areas the book was funny, but the language was foul.  It got so bad I had to skip over vast parts and really didn't get much out of it.  Was a waste of money in my opinion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|While I don't generally read books like this, I was suprised by the depth and vivid descriptions that were in this book.  I felt like I was right there in District 12 among the others hurting for Katniss and Peeta.  The love story that follows along is amazing too.  To think that the world could one day be like this is horrible.  I don't even want to think of the horrors I would endure as a mother if one of my children were put in this position.  I can't wait to read the others in this series.  On a side note, the movie was not that great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the BEST Bible apps that I have ever gotten and it was FREE.  I can choose reading plans and the app keeps up with where I am in the daily reading and will sent an email if I get behind; can look up scripture; so, so very many different versions, i.e. King James Version, NIV Version, etc.  You can bookmark a passage, join in a conversation with others that are reading the bible through this app.  I cannot find enough words to describe how great this is.  Love, Love, Love it!!!
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|Simple, easy to learn, progressively difficult puzzle game.  Attempting to get full stars on each stage can add additional goals for the obsessive compulsive.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The relationship these two begin is so powerful and complex. Really feels like you are a part of it. Highly encourage reading but make sure you have the time!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love how u can play with your friends and its funny because some times you don't know what to draw for the word so its just like a random picture I love it
B000URWYTS|4.0|Enjoyed reading Loving Frank.  The story of  Frank Lloyd Wright's genius, career, weaknesses, strengths,  and loves held my attention.  Knowing the novel was based on real events made the story hard to put down.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Nice game very additive, got up to level 23 and enjoyed playing.  Recommend if you enjoy all the other jewel games.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little sharpener is really light and compact, I have 1 in my B.O.B and 1 in my get home bag, highly recommend this, and for a few bucks, not too bad. Love the serration sharpener too!
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Nice addictive checkers game that you can pick up for a few minutes at a time.  No obvious issues, if you play too much the computer becomes predictable.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Pretty stupid story line - some amusing performances.  The a cappella group productions were actually quite good.  No laugh out loud moments.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The eighth season did not disappoint. I cannot wait for next week to view the rest of the episodes in this season!!!
B008469DGY|5.0|Quit reading reviews. U wont regret getting this one. Its addictive from the very begining.  I would like to see some more levels, but its still a 5 star app.
1451629184|5.0|Read it in day.  A life stole is a perfect discription. not to revileing but enough to let you know how much one person can suffer and endure. with a good attitude. and Still be sane.  Makes one want to be more up lifting and watchful.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Captures the essences of early Stones and the Chicago Blues Scene as it was happening in that time frame. Well worht it!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good story line but it seemed like it went too fast and didn't go into much detail about anything. Overall I'd say it was a decent read.
0765325950|4.0|Finally, finally the series is over.  Let me just start out by saying I am a fan of Brandon Sanderson's other works.  I think he does a great job telling a story, and moving the pace along.  I think of him as more of a trilogy writer as opposed to the more expansive epics that Jordan and Martin have popularized ($$$$).<br /><br />That being said, he took on an impossible task of wrangling the plot threads that have been tangling and dangling for over 20 years and produced a satisfying conclusion.  He didn't (and couldn't) resolve all the threads in this book, but the big finish is there, and I find it satisfying. Opinions will vary, but I think those who remember the misery of those middle books clearly will be glad to get to AN ending.<br /><br />I'm curious to see if he will return to WoT in the future to cover some of the fallout/omissions, but I can say THANK YOU from all the folks who started this series in the early '90s and didn't think we'd ever see Tarmon Gai'don.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Not a chick flick...actually quite funny and had some great music.  Not only did my wife and I watch it twice on back to back days but downloaded the album.
B004T4LUPW|3.0|I put that information up front for those also looking for a calendar that will sync with the calendar on your phone. This does, and more, and well. There are settings enough to keep you busy all night, and I would have preferred something simpler, but was desperate to get my Google calendar on my Fire. I heartily object to the hefty price tag....it&acute;s still just a calendar app, so I would probably not buy other apps from this developer. With all sales final, just bad business on Amazon's part, I could just have easily gotten stuck with a useless app......again. It has though, worked perfectly.  Not giving 5 stars because of price and too many settings to plow through.
1419705849|5.0|A gift to a grand child they dont make them fast enough for the kids... they love them and it is hard to find all of them
0765325950|1.0|This is my first \\"review\\" on Amazon.  I logged in to express out extremely disappointed I am at the lack of an ebook for my favorite series.  I have purchased all 13 previous books at full price.  Ebooks are the world you live in TOR.  I don't care how good or bad this book is I am downvoting an old dated product in the hope that I will see change.
B00A25NLOU|4.0|A fun read wedding modern technology and new culture with the old. Will be watching for more from Robin Sloan.
0375507256|4.0|I am beginning to tire of shape-shifting chapters ala The History of Love where you must reread for clues and the novel is more a jigsaw puzzle than literature.<br />However, the book is brilliant once you adapt to the author's mechanisms.
0439882826|5.0|This book is for my grandson.  He will just love it being a star wars fan.  And the work is , as usual for Matthew Reinhart, exceptional.  Loved it! What a great gift.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Usually in the theatre I'm the first one asleep...in this movie I was into it from the first scene until the last. Jamie Foxx has really stepped up his acting game. Christopher Waltz is Oscar worthy as usual, and Samuel L. Jackson is the best \\"Uncle Tom\\" this side of the cotton field...but for Leo Dicaprio...this was totally out of the box for him and I think he's finally going to grab some kind of award, be it Golden Globe or Oscar. He went above and beyond. I could care less about the controversy and snuffs from various haters. This is just plain great Hollywood entertainment as only Quentin Tarantino brings it!!! Even the soundtrack is unchained...a little bit of everything from the old speghetti western themes to John Legend. You won't be disappointed!!! ENJOY.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I am a big fan os Game of Thrones, so had to have the DVD's, it is such an amazing serial cannot wait till I have the rest.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I could not wait to purchase the live DVD from Sade's 2011 tour. I was fortunate to catch it live twice during her tour in Atlanta and Greensboro and it truly was a magical experience.<br /><br />Since Sade tours on average every decade I make it a point to purcahse her tour DVD's so that I can relive the experience anytime I want. Whether you are a die hard Sade fan like me or you never heard of them this DVD will make you a fan for life. Her concert performances over the years have been something of a revelation. Sade is the best band in the business in my opinion. Her classics and new music provide a sultry, sensuous ride for the true music enthusiast. What I loved most about this DVD was the behind the scenes footage from her extensive tour. It made me really appreicate SADE and their love and dedication to their very loyal fans. This is a beautifully put together showcase and gift from SADE. It is a must have for all music lovers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game works beautifully on Kindle fire and the graphics are very good. The game controls works well. The game is similar to [[ASIN:B0086700CM Temple Run]] & [[ASIN:B008J1ZVRY Temple Run: Brave]] with some twists making it fun to play. The game-play involves running away from grumpy Inspector and his dog and overcome the obstacles on the way jumping tracks, trains etc; and having fun. Typical teenager style and correctly represented by the characters. You can enable various other characters by scoring points and collect various hidden objects to enable certain characters. This game does not have any need for tilt controls like Temple Run but just mere swipes up down and left right is all that it takes to navigate. Double tapping enables additional Hoverboard skating options.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: While I could play this free game without actually purchasing anything extra please be aware that this app *DOES* have the potential for you to purchase additional content using money tied to your Amazon account. Amazon does protect you from getting those accidental in-app purchases. You can configure 'parental controls' for all in-app purchases for your account and devices, which will require your Amazon account password or a 4-digit PIN (You can even lock Wi-Fi using this Parental controls before handing it over to your child) This can be done by going to the Settings menu from within the Amazon Appstore.<br /><br />The game is otherwise free and provides hours of challenging fun. Good game five stars!
B004XXIHS2|3.0|I really enjoyed the first part of this book, but then it started to get too cliché for me. I guess I can see how it was a great book for its time, but next to today's crime and suspense novels it was just OK.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Modern family just plain makes us laugh in this household.  It's just charming, and laugh out loud good.<br />The series progresses and not one of the season is bad, all great tv.  Highly recommended!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I put off getting this because it was &#34;old school&#34;  Then when I did get it, it became addictive to me.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|Love the series, just hope it never stops. Cannot stop reading once you start, you become one with the story.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I own this same version on DVD and the captions or English subtitles only show up if the TV has the option.  This Blu-ray version gives the option on the menu of the disc itself.  Of course, you can leave them off if you prefer.  However, my household really needed English subtitles because one member is hard of hearing.  My hearing is near perfect but I like a \\"back up\\" in case I misunderstand the British English accents and 19th century England's words and phrasing.  Also, there is a slightly crisper and more vibrant color quality to this Blu-ray version.  Unfortunately, there are no extras such as the making of or interviews.<br /><br />As for the content, this is close to a perfect version of Jane Austen's story.  True, some of the actors are older looking or even less attractive than their characters are described, but that is nit-picking.  At least, this 1995 mini-series does not add or take away in portraying her novel.  Other reviewers have written detailed contrasts so I'll leave it to them.  Another accurate to the original story version is the 1980 Pride and Prejudice starring Elizabeth Garvie.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I have enjoyed this game and plan on playing it for a long time coming.  You should try it today
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had minecraft for xbox360 and it is really fun so I got pockect edition and it is really fun to.
0316019984|5.0|If you are a pop up book collector, as I am, you will love this book! Superhero's from everyone's youth.  Great work.!
B005PTQPU0|2.0|After having had this album for a while, I realize that I was very hasty in my judgment (I gave a positive review after maybe one listen). I don't like it at all, it is very boring and repetitious. I agree with the reviews here that say it is like watching snow melt - VERY boring. I did enjoy Aerial - one that seems to be under fire as well - because at least it varied its approach throughout. This one sounds like one long song that never ends. I don't much like that her first track, the first single too, features her son and not her. And the title track is just reciting by that Fry guy. She doesn't come out with any real experiments, it's all piano and when she gets bogged down in too much piano, I can do nothing but yawn. Aerial barely escaped being that monotonous, but she does have some instrumentation on it. This one is, as I said, almost purely piano which I'm not that huge a fan of (though at one time I also played it). If you are like me and a diehard fan - I have every single recording and video she ever released) - I can only say you have been well and truly warned if after this much time since its release you still don't have it. Otherwise I guess it's pointless to go on any further. I also find it quite a serious downer of a depressing listen. Who knows what the next time will bring? I didn't like the \\"Director's Cut\\" either, it's full of her just hacking away at her own old ideas. I often think that if she was inclined to do this, it should have been LIVE and not in the studio. One can't see 50 going on tour! NO thanks...
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie came to my house in the expected number of days in good condition.I love the Hunger Games. 5 star rating
0545425115|4.0|Like many of my friends at my university, I was very hesitant about reading The Hunger Games because if there's anything I've learned about Young Adult books is that they are lame and poorly written. During my winter break however, I was pretty exhausted after reading nothing but history dissertations and Ulysses by James Joyce that I decided I wanted to read something just for fun, regardless of how scholarly it was. I was at my sisters house and noticed my little nephew had a copy of The Hunger Games on his bookshelf and after looking at it for some time, I decided to give it a try. I started reading the book at around 11:00 PM and finished it the very next day. I didn't even sleep! I was very surprised at the amount of violence and details that are in this book, especially since it is published by Scholastic. Suzanne Collins did what most young adult writers fail to do (*cough Stephanie Meyer cough*)by writing a book that not only is well written but entertaining as well. Is this book in the top ten I've ever read? No, but I felt like it was a nice escape from all the other literature out there. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone out there looking for a fun story to kill some time.
B009VB97EY|3.0|It was okay for what it was,  I definetly was entertained if nothing else while watching and the guys weren't bad to watch!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Good app. I love it! It's so entertaining. Especially when I'm super duper bored. I really like pizza. And food.
B004132HZS|5.0|Great season. BBC sure knows how to do it right!  My favourite all time Sleuth.  &#34;Sherlock&#34; is just perfection for the role!,as is his sidekick.  Great tv.!
B0061TQBRK|5.0|Lacuna Coil does it again, it's fabulous and quite dark too. I can't go into individual songs, they are all great!
B000S1L7IU|5.0|Somehow I had missed this book when it came out so it made it even more enjoyable since I have read, now, all of his words....whether only by him or with co-authors. Had the privilege of meeting Clive.....a delightful person with a beautiful wife of many years.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love this movie and replay it often, never ceasing to be entertained each time.  Everyone I gifted this to also loves it and one comment was \\"it's an iconic movie that should be in everyone's DVD library\\".
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have become addicted to this game.  I do However wish that it was a little easier to get power without paying for it
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I had seen this movie before, but wanted it for my Kindle.  Very happy with my purchase, I love it!
B001XRLWPQ|3.0|This series, although quite highly rated, did just not do it for me.  I found the chemistry lacking between these two.  My husband felt the same.  Not for us , anyways, when there are so many good shows out there.
B000002A46|5.0|This is an excellent Christmas music CD. I lost mine and reordered it through Amazon. Very happy! She has an awesome voice and does an excellent job on Christmas music.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|New technology gives this retold story added action and Colin does his usual fine job. The female villain is well played.
B0049J5EWW|5.0|My biggest problem with watching &#34;Toy Story&#34; is that it makes me think of the impossibly better &#34;Toy Story 3.&#34; As a result, I think about how I felt during &#34;Toy Story 3.&#34; And I remember that &#34;Toy Story 3&#34; is unabashed in its attempt to turn each viewer into a sentimental blob of saline.<br /><br />Thus?<br /><br />I shift you not: I cried at 2:45 on this movie.<br /><br />Yes. Not even three full minutes into the movie, and I poured my soul out. My girlfriend gave me tissues, while my roommate came out of her room to make sure everything was okay.<br /><br />Obviously, I have a lot of issues with growing up and the concepts of maturity. &#34;Toy Story 3&#34; is the ostensible conclusion to Andy's coming of age. And to a large extent, his transformation occurs nearly simultaneous with mine.<br /><br />Yes. I'm 26, and Andy is turning 18 and going to college. But as a coddled manchild for the good part of my early-20s, I laid in a sort of developmental hibernation that stunted my ability to progress beyond that very same threshold that Andy walked through and drove away from when he left his toys on Bonnie's lawn.<br /><br />Jesus. I am at work now, and I don't know if I can keep it together. The immensity of my adulthood weighs down on me, pulling me to reality when all I can think about are cartoon clouds perfectly patterned across the walls of my room, a chest of toys waiting for me in the corner to ignite my imagination and take me away from the horrors of mediocrity.<br /><br />Mother!
B008476HBM|5.0|Awesome book!!!! Loved it and the movie!!!! Will be reading more of Jane Austen, don't know why I haven't read these before!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|great writing and characters in authentic setting during WW1 and a wonderful stroke of genius seeing how it affects everyone from the soldier, the maid, the butler, the chaffeur, the doctor and nurses - all the way up to nobility.  I'm especially enjoying how the nobility comes to be more human and responsible and how they all make it through.
B001FB4W16|3.0|The books are so much better than the t.v. show, although in all fairness, there are some gorgeous male vamps in the show! (re Eric the vamp!)<br />If you've read the series, you may not really enjoy the show as much because they really don't follow the book, and seem to make up things as they go along. In reading the books, I'd envisioned different people in my head for the roles (unlike say &#34;game of thrones&#34; where the tv show and the book (in my head) completely matched the characters.<br /> I'd say, if you haven't read the books, go for it.  It was a wildly popular show!  If you want a better show to  buy, (just in my humble opinion)  you can't go wrong with Game of Thrones!
8862933177|5.0|Awesome gift for the Movie Lover.  A journal...the perfect gift for a talented screenwriter, or for the movie buff who enjoys remembering each film he/she watches.  Received item -- exactly as described.  Super fast shipping.  Loved the product.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|John Carter is terrific. Female lead is worth the admission. Special effects and story line add to the results. Definitely enjoy this story of his Mars adventure.....
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It makes you feel all the emotions the characters are feeling. However at the end I was left with a lot of questions, hopefully the second book will give me some answers. Definitely worth the read
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I don't remember my high school history book giving much info on WWI.<br />Reading of the diplomacy and feeling of the common man about this war gave me<br />insight to many of the feelings of many people.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My wife loves this CD.  It came on time the day before Christmas.  Love the PRIME membership...it saved my life.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed Season one immensely.  Not so much the rest of the seasons.  We did purchase season 2, but went through it quite unenthusiastically.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Received the movie set super fast.  The item was exactly as depicted in description.  My son loved this Christmas gift!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I have the regular version, the re-release version and now the the Blu ray.  I am one happy person.  DVD's are just what a person needs if they are sick or recuperating from surgery.  The color is clear, rich and relaxing.  I couldn't be more satisied.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This is a great movie. I enjoyed it. The only flaw I didn't like is the curse words that just wasn't necessary. And the part with wolvie cursing (really). But other than that it was good. I like the part when Erik told Raven to be herself that was good. She morphs into Rebecca Stamos and than into her real self pretty cool. the whole movie was great.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|One of the best books read in a while! I was worried before I started that maybe having 6 stories within stories might be a taxing structure to follow, but it just makes it all the more interesting. I like how each story has a very different style of writing, so it really is like getting six books for the price of one, but at the same time the six stories are linked together beautifully! A great read!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The first two, while not great, were substantially better than this one. This book just lacked anything to distinguish itself.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the best books I have read in years. I couldn't put it down, and immediately downloaded book 2 upon completion.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Perfect to carry any docs you may need to carry with you..Compatable with word, excell,etc.It is also user friendly. I have not had any problems with this app as of yet.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I never take my Kindle out but the cover protects my kindle from the paws of my 3 cats.  Those stinkies will walk on everything if I don't shoo them away.  Hey, maybe the cover can enlarged to hold a netbook.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My iPhone app has new books (who knows where those came from) and i wanna know why my highlights dont want to save... i believe it also ha  to do with the update... please fix
B0095R76EW|3.0|For a chick-flick, it was a pretty good movie. You know, standard formula for the romantic comedy. Things are good, then things are bad, everybody learns stuff, then things end good. The middle part on this one - where they fell apart and forgot what it was all about- dragged on a bit.  They could have trimmed out 20 minutes of the middle.<br /><br />Our picture quality from the Amazon rental was terrible.  We don't get this problem when we stream from Netflix or CinemaNow.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Wow!  I have had friends recommending Homeland to me for about a year now and I kept dismissing it as another crime drama type of show.  I could not have been more wrong!  I started watching the first episode with my wife and a few days later we had watched the entire first season.  This show has been more entertaining and has kept me more immersed than any other series I have watched in years.<br /><br />This is definitely not another crime drama.  There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing right until the very end and the actors do such a great job with their characters that you will be on the edge of your seat just waiting to see what happens to them.  Owning the DVDs has been great because there were definitely times when I had to go back and re-watch a scene or even a whole episode out of sheer disbelief over what I just saw.  My only complaint is that season two wasn't immediately available for me to buy at the same time.<br /><br />I rank this show with the likes of Rescue Me, The Wire, and The Sopranos<br /><br />If you enjoy good drama or just good television this is a show worth watching.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Another great story though dragged on in parts with the action scenes. He's starting to sound a lot like 007, maybe a bit much for Pendergast?
B009JBWOU0|5.0|All great movies. It is cheaper to by the set of three rather than to buy them all individually. This set comes with a booklet that has pictures from all three movies that are really good.
1881273156|1.0|This is an excellent book everyone should read it.  It will help any relationship, and even gives tips on how to define you love language.  This is a must read for the younger generation as well as the &#34;mature&#34; generation.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|so I played the game for the longest time and I had a whole bunch of houses. The houses take time to give u money but the time on it was like 100 hours till! Well it was a little glitchy anyway! So I waited 100 hours but when I came back they all said 100 hours. Uhhhhhg! so I just deleted it. end of story.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Looper  the movie sucked  the action sucked  Bruce willis sucked  what you want me to write a book on how bab this movie  looper sucked
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a great tool if you travel about some. And it ok if you need to know what is going on around your home or office. It lets you know if there is a possibility of interferance and what kind of siginal strength you are receiving. The none tech. type users will find it very helpful. The tech.type will find the Spestrum Analyzer very useful and that you have about all you need to set up a Wi-Fi site as far as radio frequency is concerned.<br /><br />Flay
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game.... need more free coins... not enough free coins.... thanks . wish that their was more free coins
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Omg, this book has left me soooooo sleep deprived! Once I started I couldn't put it down! Amazing twists and turns but wow what an unbelievable story! I hope there is a second edition to this some how! I still think there is sooo much more to these two and how there lives turn out!<br />I just wish there was an epilogue!! So many books don't have 1 and it devastates me !<br />Can't wait to see what u come up with next Colleen! Absolutely fantastic! :-)
B000002GJH|5.0|this cd still kick's ass for me today 'cuz good music is timeless.i'm a fan of all the track's except ''hunger strike'' cuz it got way to much airplay.my local radio station play's 2 cut'soff the cd nowaday's and i can't gripe about.if you are a chris cornell fan this belong's in your collection.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|My husband and I saw this together, he is in no-way a fan of musicals; however, he said he'd go with me.  We both were blown away by this movie.  Loved the music, live and from the actors.  If the music would have been dubbed with professional opera singers, it would have taken away from the raw, realism of the story.  We both give it five stars.  Downloaded the sound tract, ordered the cd and am on the waiting list for the dvd movie.  Academy Award Winner for us.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am always pleasantly surprised that the Grisham books are still as good as ever.  This one is no diffferent.  I was hooked right away and could not put it down.  Excellent!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So much better than I expected!!! Loved it! Would definitely recommend this book to other readers and was great read
B003N0XDT4|5.0|Product was as described-my fianc&eacute; loved opening this Christmas morning! He's a huge audiophile, so this was perfect! Thank you!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I happen to like Grisham's style so it is no surprise i liked this one too.  He weaves a good tale and keeps it pretty simple so that it is easy to follow along.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Was unimpressed.  Perhaps I saw too much potential in a movie with great accents and a girl with a bow.  Was just another whiny rebelious kid discovers she has to be responsible sometimes.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Good book. Wanted an easy yet thoughtful read, this book did that and yet gave me a mind opening experience. Well done!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book had less of the hotness that was included in the other two books. It still made me wish there was another book to read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could hardly put this book down. Beautifully written, romantic, must read! I will be checking out Colleen's other books.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Setting up my aquaponic garden has been a challenge but this book has helped tremendously. I find myself constantly referencing it.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|George Michael has a great formula for entertaining.  This guy can shake, rattle and roll.  The amazing part of his performance is he is really a one man show in appearance.  Got to give plenty of credit to the  people behind the scene who makes it happen.  Get the DVD and enjoy!  Good stuff
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it. Random deals hard to win buts that's as it s/b. The ads are annoying but easy to work around.
014241543X|5.0|The book was shipped on time, the  shipper sent it really fast, the book was like brand new, I am very satisfied with the shipper and plan on getting more if I get the chance
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game (app) should be paid. I would buy it even if it was $10.best very best app in the app store!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've taken some time to process this book before writing down my thoughts, and my mind is still reeling. At first, the story seems predictable, with a very creepy male heroine, but then it gets deeper. Difficult issues are broached and things aren't quite what they seem.<br /><br />I actually liked all of the characters at first (well, Holder takes some time to get used to lol), and they grew on me even more as the story progressed! I especially loved the friendship between Sky and Six. The way they talked to each other and the things they texted each other seriously made me laugh.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Slammed and Point of Retreat, but I was a little hesitant to start Hopeless. I shouldn't have worried. Colleen Hoover amazed me again with her genuine characters and very creative plot.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved bared to you and couldn't wait for the 2nd in the series... This def didn't disappoint. Another powerful insight into Eva and Gideons lives.. Can't believe I have to wait until may 2013 for book 3..
B009329ZF2|3.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son. He had asked for this movie. After watching it he said it was not a very good movie.
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|Though I knew exactly what was going to occur, from having read the famed graphic novel at least once per year since I was 10, Jay Oliva and the team at WB/DC managed to keep me compelled at every turn. This is a stellar adaptation of Frank Miller's unequivocal masterpiece and the probably the single greatest Batman story ever told. An absolute must see.
0142420891|5.0|The book came on time, it was in new condition, very satisfied, now just waiting to finish the book I am reading so I can start reading very satisfied with customer
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I was very surprised by this sweet story. The kids loved it- as did I. Great story, excellent animation, funny.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I am not much of a game player but I downloaded this when it was free to give it a try.  I am now addicted.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Absolutely addictive.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon as enthralling.. Really feel their pleasure and pain.. Can't wait for next novel . Well done Sylvia Day.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|This is a fantastic faux-mexi-sploitation movie. It is so over-the-top, exploiting so many 1980's action tropes, guns, explosions, boobs, boob-stand-ins, Lindsay Lohan playing a burnout, it has it all. Have very cheesy expectations and you'll do fine.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Joker rules. Well paced movie for all ages. And hd obviously adds a lot of value to the scenes. Overall a very good movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The plot was intricate and fascinating. I enjoyed every word of this book.I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good read.
B009186JYI|5.0|This is old footage of the guys way before Jagger knew how to rock out on stage. He was still developing his act and dance steps. It was fascinating to see their reaction to crowds of fans. It was as if they were seeing a tsunami wave coming at them.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|It's the only option available but it works great.  My only complaint is that it drains the battery out of my H3B that already suffers from quick battery drain.
B001DUGOWY|1.0|This price is OUTRAGEOUS for a Kindle book!!!  It should be much less for one I can't even share with others!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I really love this book. I've read the whole series and love all the books. This is probably one of the best books ever written. Everyone should read it!!
B003F3PMYI|4.0|watch Shawn Achor's TED talk to get a preview of what the book is about.  I bought the book because the TED talk was so compelling.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I love Andrew Lincoln in this first season.  This is a gift for my son and we both love this collection and all of its parts. This was the only gift he really was excited about.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Loved the movie.  Loved the soundtrack.  The music is very upbeat.  Good CD to dance to or even workout with.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I bought this cd because I like &#34;Somebody that I used to know'....and I found that all the songs on this cd are enjoyable!  I would recommend purchasing thru Amazon for both the easy of the transaction and good price!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It needs A LOT more time like really 15 minuets?!?! I like buuut it just needs a ton of more time!!!!! ARE YOU WITH ME PEOPLE!?!?!?!
B009CCBCU4|5.0|I just finished reading Zoe Saadia's The Highlander (The Rise of The Aztecs Series, book 1). It is such a wonderful blend of history and fiction. I was totally absorbed in her two young characters Kuini and Coyotl, and the friendship they forged, in spite of the fact that they were supposed to be enemies. For me, there was a strong message for today, that transcends the historical background of her story. Her introduction of the young female Iztac-Ayotl, makes this as compelling a love between two young people as any in contemporary society. I look forward to reading all the books in this series, to see where their adventures lead. Kudos to Ms Saadia for bringing a strong message of hope in our own time and weaving it with almost poetic precision via these entertaining characters. Kudos Ms Saadia for your provoking dance through Mesoamerica.
1608871088|5.0|The artists at Dreamworks know their stuff. The movie is gorgeous and so is this book! If you are a fan, this is one piece of merchandise worth buying. This book is LARGE and full of tons of concept work. Worth the money!
B0011Z0ZZS|5.0|Ohhhhhhhhhh....Michael so beautiful! Listen on my tablet while reading on the beach...Perfect. Love it and it has 13 songs. A great buy.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Hands down, one of the funniest movies I have ever seen... just don't play next to your kids, Ted is definitely not your stereotypical Teddy bear..,
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Well, you are just the individuals that can appreciate this &#34;company humor&#34; movie that takes more than once to catch all of the inuendo and funny lines that this movie offers.  This is more than just a funny dig at corporate America it is about every person who has been disenchated with their job and just loves to laugh!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has opened a new side and I would recommend it to men and women in a relationship to read. It is intense and downright on the sexual side and drive your mine into a wonderful place.  Read it an  experience it for yourself
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Got it as a gift for the hubby per his request.  He really enjoyed it and watched it a few times already.  Arrived in good condition and there is nothing wrong with the recording.
B003UESJFG|5.0|...because one thing that is never really mentioned about this movie is the huge middle finger it gives to \\"Nice Guys\\". It's no wonder that kids don't often respond well to this movie when the biggest problems in it are more \\"real\\" and adult than one would expect. This movie was packaged as a silly kids movie targeted to little boys but instead attracts tons of adult women. This is one of the few \\"kids\\" movies that portrays the female character as someone who can hold her own (she's not at all afraid of the villain Megamind, is bored and unimpressed by the hero Metro Man, is anything but a damsel in distress, and often contributing to the plot rather than being in the background... like most female characters are). The romance in this movie is never advertised and I feel that it's extremely important to mention, and advertise... Megamind likes her! But Megamind is also evil, unsocialized, and self-centered. Do the math. But Megamind isn't the \\"Nice Guy\\" I mentioned before. You'll see. But I feel it's important to bring this up, since we live in a society where kids are taught that \\"boys will be boys\\" to girls... which I shouldn't get into any further within a review of a kids movie for obvious reasons. So this movie wins for not only a respectable and contributing female character, but also the subtle example of how \\"Nice Guy\\" behavior can go way too far. Kids most likely won't understand this movie too well until they're older, but that doesn't mean they won't enjoy it. If you are a parent, make sure you talk with them afterwards about this movie. I'm serious. Ask them why the villain shouldn't behave as he does with Roxanne, explain to them that people are not possessions, or prizes, and that women deserve the same respect as men. Explain to them that Megamind's villainy is a cartoon, and should never be repeated in reality. Explain to them Megamind's main theme of making up for your mistakes, as well as never giving up. This is a Dreamworks movie with a lot of hidden potential for discussion-- maybe watch it once before watching it with your kid, because it could be a good learning tool! But all of this serious talk aside, don't worry-- this movie is hilarious, touching, and you'll fall in love with Megamind within the first ten minutes. I promise. This movie is worth a look! And no, this movie is nothing like Despicable Me. I wish people would stop comparing the two.dden potential for discussion-- maybe watch it once before watching it with your kid, because it could be a good learning tool!

0345803493|5.0|This was a great series to read. Kept me interested the whole time, couldnt put it down. Very addicting and wanting more.
B004EKCNMA|2.0|Nice picture quality but really sloooooow plot development, even for anyone who has read the book or seen at least 20-30 versions of the same film.
B000093FLA|5.0|Make certain to have the words expressed on the bottom of the screen as Brad has a very convincing accent and it is almost impossible to understand his gypsy Irish words.  This is a funny, mature, entertaining movie.  Love the all-star cast and the unusual twists that the story takes!!  Good addition to our library!!
B002ZG994U|2.0|Lots of action but not up to the standards of the television show which had some class. Sorry, cant recommend it.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Not only is this the only set so far to include the Captain America minifigure, but it comes with two of the alien soldiers, one on a flyer and the other to man the weapon emplacement, which makes it a great army builder to give your Avengers minifigures some enemies to run through.  Pick it up!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app!  Many of our church members use this instead of carrying their bible.  it's a lot faster to look up certain verses, and you can also choose which version you want at whatever time.  Would definitely be worth the download ;)

0765325950|3.0|I've been a fan of WoT since I first started reading it in 1991.  I've probably read or listened to the first book 10 times at least.  I'm actually an owner of \\"A Memory of Light\\" (audible version) and have so far only listened to about an hour.  But I'm posting this review now to combat all the negative reviews just because it's not coming out on Kindle right away.<br /><br />If you're mad about the delay in the Kindle version, go get yourself a trial Audible account and use your first credit on this book.  You won't be disappointed.  Kate Reading and Michael Kramer are the voices of WoT and do a wonderful job bringing it to life.  Also the Audible version will help you with your New Year's resolution of going to the gym more often!<br /><br />Once the Kindle version comes out you'll get a discount on that version because you already own the Audible version.  I'm one who will buy it and read it again after listening, but as I pointed out at the beginning of my review, I've read book 1 at least 10 times so that just me.  I'm sure some of you don't like to read books over and over again.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson has stated that he really pushed to get the Kindle version out at the same time, but Harriet McDougal (Robert's Widow) has asked that it wait.  See, Robert was a little old school and drug his feet on releasing the e-versions.  I remember he released the prologue for book 8 I think it was, on eReader.com years ago, but wouldn't release the full book because he was afraid of pirating.  He even said his e-version contract would burst into flames every night at midnight! So that is why Amazon doesn't have it on Kindle yet, at the copyright owner's wishes.  Nothing we can do about it and if Brandon can't change Harriet's mind, Amazon or a bunch of angry reviews aren't going to either.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm going to get back to my book.  Thank you, Robert Jordan, RIP!  Thank you, Harriet, for entrusting your husband's legacy to Brandon!<br /><br />Update:  After listening to the book, I'm not sure I'll buy the Kindle version.  I'd give the final book 3 stars.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Don't buy this expecting it to be realistic. If  you've made it 5 movies into this series then you know by now to expect ridiculous cars, stunts, and plot. If you want a couple hours of mindless entertainment then this is the move for you.
0345803507|5.0|This was a great series to read. Kept me interested the whole time, couldnt put it down. Very addicting and wanting more.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have watched The Wizard of Oz for over 20 years and have enjoyed it every time.  Have also  brought it on VHS  and<br />DVD  every chance I got.  This was the first time I actually red the book itself.<br /><br />It was truly enjoyable, uplifting and interesting.  I was more fascinated by the original story than the movie.  Don't get me wrong because I still love and enjoy the picture.<br /><br />The story and details were so different and fulfilling I did not  want to put it down.  I will be recommending this to my nieces is twelve and others who have never read the book but saw the movie.  It was so very different and as colorfully.  Enjoy!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|An amazing president.  Understood people and how to motive them.  Patient, kind, considerate.  Learned much about went on behind the scenes of government during the Civil War.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Charlize Theron deserves praise for making a believable evil queen, but she could not save this film from the poor story line and pacing. It's mildly entertaining, but wait until it goes on sale for $1.99 rental.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I enjoy all Pixar movies...good story and humor that appeals to both children and adults, so it's good a family movie night.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This has has so much love and passion in it that you can't put it down until you finish!! Very addicting book!

B008G12ERC|4.0|Muse waste no time on album #6 in going right for the pomp. \\"Supremacy\\" kicks off \\"The 2nd Law\\" like some expectation of a James Bond movie theme, incorporating a movie-like theme and building into a cinematic overthrow of anything else that may follow. But that's Muse. If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing. Which is a main part of the band's charm.<br /><br />Queenly pompous and football stadium huge, Muse are one of the few bands that currently play it on a large scale. Take the exaggerated funk of \\"Panic Station,\\" a dead ringer for Queen's \\"Fun It,\\" or the upward crescendo of their contribution to the 2012 Olympics, the monumental \\"Survival\\" (which is self important enough to have its own prelude). Spiraling up to a mammoth cascade of vocal overlays and epic anthem guitars, it was a fitting song to play over Olympian triumphs.<br /><br />New to the band is the stepping out of bass player Chris Wolstenholme, who tries his hand at singing and songwriting in place of main man Matthew Bellamy. On \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Liquid State,\\" which provide a break to Muse's usual sledgehammer approach. \\"Liquid State\\" is the more driven of the pair, which then leads into the band's set of prog numbers, \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\" and \\"The 2nd Law: Isolated System.\\" Not since Alan Parsons has a band attempted to go this grand; who else would try a duo of songs based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics? (The entropy of an isolated system never decreases, because isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium--the state of maximum entropy - thanks Wikipedia.)<br /><br />lading with stings, horns and choral effects, it's the sound of ambition pole vaulting into classic rock territory. Parsons would be proud of his prodigies in this case, although I bet a lot of fans will be confused. Me, I usually like when one of my favorite bands tries to get their rocks off doing something against the grain. Be it the electronics of \\"Madness\\" or the theater of \\"The Second Law,\\" Muse delivers on their promise to not be run-of-the-mill.Law,\\" Muse delivers on their promise to not be run-of-the-mill.

B00APUQRPC|3.0|As always Clint Eastwood was great, Justin Timberlake and Amy Adams were very good -movie was just okay, could have/should have RedBoxed for the money.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great action, and physical stunts!<br />Lots of new High Tech tools used by the actor's in the movie.<br /><br />The opening scene of Moscow Russia really sets high expectations for excepetional movie experience.<br /><br />I think it is the Best Mission imposible movie so far!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The Walking dead is the most fantastic and intense zombie show of all times!  Movie quality production and FX in a TV series is amazing.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
B008NA2JMQ|4.0|The book provided an interesting story and a unique view into the life of the rich and famous. However sometimes it seems that his writing and dialogue is self indulgent and the equivalent of self masturbation as he tries to persuade his audience about how intelligent and talented he is.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading the series about 10 years ago when I was in middle school. The world of WOT has always been an incredible source of entertainment, and it's with a mix of emotions that I see the final book come out.<br /><br />The big issue is the lack of an ereader version. I would, like many other fans, willingly pay a premium (equal to or greater than the normal price hurdle that is a hardcover book). I've read that the ereader delayed release decision was Harriet and Tor's joint choice, but that doesn't make sense to me. I understand that TOR is a publishing company, and as a company they try to make money by using the tried and true hardcover-->paperback release method to capture the people with that willingness to pay.<br /><br />BUT it seems like TOR is being a bit myopic in the service it's providing. It looks like TOR still considers itself a provider of scifi books, and not of scifi entertainment. Anyone interested in that general idea should look at Levitt's \\"Marketing Myopia.\\" This could have been a wonderful chance for TOR to begin repositioning itself and see that there is still massive profit to be had without forcing people to purchase large, heavy, environmentally unfriendly books.<br /><br />TL:DR<br />5 stars to counterbalance all the 1 stars since this is going to be an incredible book.<br />EVERYONE CLICK THE \\"WANT THIS BOOK FOR KINDLE?\\" BUTTON ON THE AMOL AMAZON PAGE. While less effective than 1 star ratings for getting TOR's attention, it also doesn't hurt Sanderson or Harriet as much as all the 1 star ratings.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|bought for a gift. grandson loves the movie. He keeps asking to play it over and over.  I would recommend it.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I really enjoyed this read. Although it spans a hundred years it is easy<br />to follow and takes you on a journey with more than a few twist and turns
B0091REZMW|4.0|it's a great game just wish diamonds were more plentiful.  it takes the basic hidden object game and breathes new life into it via the story.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Fast read. Interesting storyline. Well written. These books are much cheaper on Kindle than in stores so if you're interested definitely get them online!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Doesn't add much size, protect well and holds up nicely. I used this case for a full year and only say a little wear on the elastic band, but not much. I have bought two of these and recommend them to my friends with Kindle and they all loved it also.
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|&#34;Why did they make this movie?&#34; I asked myself at the end of it. Like cowboys and indians it's been made over and over and yes once again, too. &#34;Why did I watch it?&#34; was my next question. Well-worn survivalist fare. Watchable owing to the FX; attractive by it's action-genre status. I selected it on the strength of Liam Neeson billing. I watched it on the romance and spectacle of survival against the odds, yadda, yadda, yawwwwn...
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Excellent kept u guessing to the end.<br />The twists and turns surprised me every time. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good suspense novel.
B00AE2I4WK|1.0|I only got through the first 20 minutes and turned it off. There were way too many theatrics and totally unbelievable
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this series even though it sometimes goes a little too far, but James Cromwell and Jessica Lang are wonderful in it!  You love to be disgusted to them.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show. It is told in such an interesting way. I love the storyline and I love the way things are portrayed. Definitely worth watching.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just enjoy spider solitare. This app moves quickly. Good game to have.  I find I take a few moments and play to relax.
B004OC07N0|3.0|This book provides solid direction for individuals new to their roles no matter what the capacity.  The book, however, is fairly boring to read.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Such a cute movie! My son knows it word for word. Who doesn't love Dr. Seuss. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Clancy the top story teller. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love the length of this cable and it fits my cell phone, which is why I purchased it. Very happy with this purchase.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I tuned into this book so much that I read this book in 2 days 1 2 3 4 5
B00992CF6W|5.0|My two boys are seriously addicted to this game!  They both love playing it and argue over my kindle on who's turn it is to play!  I love the fact that this is building and constructing and not just going around with a gun and shooting things!
B004GJYROG|5.0|My son has this on VHS. yes, a VHS! LOL.<br />so we had to upgrade to DVD for a Christmas present.
B004LROUNG|4.0|As my first Grisham book I enjoyed it very much. I will be reading more of his books. Maybe Racketeer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very engaging story. I really enjoyed it. Can not wait for the next one. I haven't seen the movies yet.
B001G8XON0|3.0|I bought this for a friend who loves Moulin Rouge and wanted it on Blu-ray. She was thrilled and the extras were pretty awesome.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Blew through Beautiful Creatures in less than two days, and I was beyond anxious to read the sequel! Just as wonderful as the first book, and I love all the twists! The ending was AMAZING! I was thrilled! A must read for sure!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Yep, watch it every Christmas season, and usually a time or two during the year. This is a must own!
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|i found this one lacking in the story department.. yes it has action but if the have some many clones than who is real it seems to get lost on me anyways..
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I thought it was like transformers well it wasn't if you like war movies from space then this is the movie for you.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is one of my favorite holiday movies.  I purchased it for my nephew's children.  I think they will enjoy watching it over the year also.
B00005JMCW|4.0|We loved watching this with our 6 year old girls...we love playing this game as a family on Friday nights.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was OK.  Typical romance novel and vanilla world view of BDSM.  I wouldn't call it a BDSM book.  Not really realistic.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The Solitaire app on my iPhone is great! Easy to use and the &#34;hint&#34; tab is helpful in occasionally keeping a game going. Have fun!
0765325950|1.0|I like reading books on my kindle, charge me what you need to but give me the option. I will go to the library at least the wont get my money.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|The box can hold a lot of Barbies & accessories. It is great to take to Grandma's - because it's a container & &#34;playhouse&#34; all in one.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I have played the game for a while, but have not gotten into it as much as other games I have downloaded..
B007BVT5N4|1.0|I love Justin bieber. This book was amazing. I have never been to a concert because my parents say it is to expensive if I could ever talk to Justin bieber I would not freak out. I would tell him he rocks and I love him<br />Love Brooke fry
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read all of Lee Child's books and I love the character, Jack Reacher, in the stories.  I also enjoy the descriptions of the small towns that  would normally be nondescript, but he brings them to life.
B0097L29KM|5.0|Just as described, thanks
B0090X4GLW|4.0|I would've rather heard the film versions of most of the songs.  The arrangements on the CD aren't as great.  I had no problems with the disk at all.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This Backpack is just the perfect size for my equipment. Currently it is loaded with a Nikon D-90 with the 18-105mm lens attached, a Tamron 70-300mm, a Nikkor 50mm f1.8, an SB-700 speedlight, battery loader, lens filters, SD cards and still some space left for an additional lens if needed. It's strong, well padded and not bulky. The inner side can be configured as needed.
B0053O89U6|5.0|In 2011-2012, I watched four TV shows on a weekly and dedicated basis: HIMYM, The Office, Big Bang Theory, and Modern Family. I find Modern Family to be the funniest. Give this show a chance!
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie the Hunger Games  had good graphics, however I feel that the book was better.  Look forward to the next in series
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a hard time falling into a deep relaxed sleep sometimes.  when this happens I just listen yo the rein and thunder combination and next thing you know its time to wake up!  I love it.  also love it that if I am stressing or my hubby is,  we just listen to one of the sounds or music and NO MORE STRESS!!
0765325950|1.0|When I was told when the final book that I have been hungering for long years after was finally coming out I'm not ashamed to say I did a little dance. A story line I have been following since I was a skinny teen in highschool would finally reach it's grand finale. I have rebought every book in the series on my kindle due to the travles of my job, I do not have the luxury or keeping a bookthe size of a cinderblock in my bag. Thank you Tor for spitting on my hopes. I would have happily have forked over 20 dollars, I'd have paid the full 35 for the ebook, but I guess true understanding of how their customers think is a problem Tor has yet to deal with. Robert Jordan, we miss you, we know you'd beat them with your stick for this garbage.
B00000E4OJ|4.0|The playing is excellent. The ninth symphony is very very good, the others are good to very good. The Abbado collection is better for symphonies 1 to 6, this one is better for symphony 9 and the overtures. There are many many recordings of the 8th symphony, and some are better than Kertesz or Abbado
B009EEFTMC|2.0|Great concept. A little too pedestrian for my taste. Wish there were more modes to create more challenges. A lock mode would be fun. Lock the cube from turning & then solve. Don't like the competitive mode. Would like to see a variation featuring including difficulty whether it be speed of duplicity or size of duplicity. Has great potential, just not quite there yet for my tastes
0380715430|5.0|I LOVE this book! I picked it up last time I was in London to read on the plane back home, but I started browsing through it and it didn't even last to the airport. Mr. Bryson really outdoes himself in this installment of travel/history/humor, and it's a delight to read again and again.
B000V7J82S|5.0|put this record on side A, listen, flip to side B, flip and repeat.  the best single album collection of marley songs.
B001LF347E|5.0|The movie came in in very good condition. I had no problems watching any of the DVD's; none of them were scratched or anything, and the case was also in good condition, too. And the package arrived on time
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Must have for daily reading...The Bible is the most important book in my house,family enjoys having it for Church and daily reading.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|This AmazonBasics case is nicely designed and very well made for the price.  Although I don't presently own a camera, I plan on picking up the Fujifilm FinePix S2950 very soon.  A friend of mine has one and I have used it and it takes wonderful clear pictures.  The s2950 is a little on the larger side as digital cameras go, but fits inside this case perfectly.  Two permanently attached straps across the top of the main compartment keep the camera secure, and its easy to extract the camera from the case as well.  This case has all the pockets and extra compartments that most cases do, but AmazonBasics gets the job done at a much fairer price, and with excellent workmanship.  It's neither overly big, nor too small in my opinion.  And it's seems well hard enough to protect a camera if dropped. I also have to agree with the other reviewer here that mentioned the extra wide and quality strap that comes with it.  Most straps that come with cameras and cases get the job done well enough, but neither are they usually anything special, or worth an extra mention.  This one is for sure, and compliments this case nicely.  All in all I believe one would be hard pressed to find a better quality case for the size and price of this one.  Really nice, and very much recommended... : )
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Dark Arcana was a good game. I enjoyed the different challenges. I don't like the way these games are advertised for free,  but really aren't. There's not many games and app's free from Amazon,  unlike there are for ipad or anderoid os.
1451695195|5.0|awesome book helped out my family a whole lot  &#34; Proof Of heaven&#34;  worth keeping in your library and giving as a gift.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I got this as a reminder of one of my many favorable childhood memories. I was not dissapointed. Thumbs up
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I found this lovely little app, downloaded it on my kindle, and discovered that I was so addicted, I needed to finish each level, as I anticipated what the next level would behold.<br /><br />I would recommend this app to anyone.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|My wife is a kid at heart when it comes to Christmas so I ordered this movie for her.  It is now one of her new favorites.  It is a great modern take on how Santa delivers to all the children in the world in a single night.  We will be breaking out this blu-ray every year.
1465001107|5.0|Loved this and so did my daughter. 5 Stars is what he gave and more!<br />Awesome memories of Micheal. Miss him and his talent very much. Loved to see him in action.....none like him!!!!<br />Would recommend it to everyone who loves Micheal!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband. I like it so much that I listen to it all the time.
B001USHRCK|5.0|Besides Castle being my favorite LEGO theme, it's not a licensed set, and it has a variety of great new colors and unique pieces.  A great addition to my LEGO collection.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm a fan of the series and I'd have to say that the negative complaints are from bigger geeks than I. I decided to getit to rewatch and enjoy classics not to nit pic. I was inlove with the picture & sound quality.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great character development.  Very believable storyline.  Extremely  well written, with many twists and turns.<br /><br />As someone who works with teenagers on a daily basis, this book made me laugh and tugged at my heart in many ways.  Teachers, administrators, students this is a must read as it is a reminder that some of your students/classmates face the same issues presented in this novel.<br /><br />On a lighter note, the authors depiction of what high school life is like, is spot on....the dialogue is all too real and will make you laugh while various scenes will make you gasp and sigh.<br /><br /> You won't want a &#34;chapter break&#34; while reading Hopeless.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|As a woman who never played anything but grade-school softball, and only watched televised games with the men in my family, I basically knew little about the professional game. I couldn't quit watching this movie, I've seen it probably 5 times by now. Why? Was it because I love to sneak into the world of men and watch them negotiate and argue their way through? Yes, the negotiation scenes captivated me. Their arguments kept me on the edge of my seat. But, above all, the love for the game was finally real for me, in seeing the dogged determination it takes, along with intuitive gifts, to \\"make it\\" in \\"the show\\". Casting Brad Pitt as General Manager, as well as father of a young, gifted daughter was also a work of genius. The interactions as a parent were awe-inspiring. In the end, it is the protagonist's ethical view about what's wrong with the way the world of \\"Moneyball\\" works, that most impressed me. Pay attention to that, as it touches everything that's gone wrong in our culture. It's even more important than watching an underdog team reach the top, or a man who finally realizes the full value of what he has already achieved in his life.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I knew from the previews that this was going to be the stupidest movie I've ever wasted my time watching. I watched it to humor my husband and because we were told it was very funny. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, even though I positively despise ANY movie that stars Mark Wahlberg. Needless to say, unless your 12 or smoke a lot of pot, or just have somewhat off kilter humor, you probably won't really find it that amusing...
B0033AGPEE|5.0|I just wanted to say thank you Jimi!  I really, REALLY enjoyed this album.  If you have a decent turntable go for the NEW VINYL record instead of the CD.  You Wont regret it. Anyway,  I feel ya Jimi!  Absolutely brilliant!<br /><br />~ Hugh Bast
B0058N2SRC|1.0|None of the disk will play on my Magnavox dvd player. It came up &#34;region error&#34; every time. I researched it, and i found that some disk will not play out of their country &#34;region&#34;. Especially if they are made in the UK. The back of these dvd's say UK. So, very disapointed, the seller should have realized I was addressed in the United States!  I am in the process of returning them.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Must admit, when I first heard this band  I had a reaction similiar to that of when I first laid my virgin ears on the Beatles. COULD NOT WAIT till this album came out. Love every second of it, and already need to buy it again.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|While I must admit, I really didn't want to see it go, but, how they ended it was amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. Chair was beautiful <3 :') And the last episode made me just so happy and , ugh, I just love this show to death. I don't want to see it go.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Finished this book in less than 24 hrs. I have read recent books such as, The girl with the dragon tattoo series, Hunger Games, 50 shades of Grey, Bared to you and Gone Girl, loving them all yet Hopeless bar far blew me away. It had such a surprising twist to the story that makes you feel such emotion for both Holder and Sky. I was so sad when I finished this book, that I may seriously re read it. I hope Colleen makes a series out of this story. Such a great read!
0765325950|1.0|I've waited long enough, I can wait a little longer.  I came to the series late, bought all the books over the last couple of years and have generally enjoyed the story (though it was getting a little tedious.)  I was looking forward to finishing it off and if I'm going to have to wait just to buy it on my Kindle, I think I'll just pick it up in 6 months at Half-Price-books and keep the proceeds from the publisher and Amazon.  Also, I think I'll just avoid Tor going forward as well.  This is no way to treat your paying customers.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great end to a great story. It is Batman so you can never go wrong. One thing I didn't like is that there is no special features besides a Bruce Wayne documentary that is about 10 minutes. But its an awesome movie.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Anyone can play this game. I really enjoy it...fun and easy to learn but challenging enough to keep you interested. Consider buying the full version....the free version has a TON of ads.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is possibly one of the greatest DVDs I have ever purchased. Amazing movie and numerous bonus features. I would recommend this product to anyone without the slightest hesitation. Just make sure you buy it from a trusted seller. My initial attempt at purchasing this item resulted in myself recieving a counterfeit copy. It looked fairly convincing, but I read the small print on the inner part of the disc and it read &#34;Dinsey&#34; instead of Disney. Either way, I tried again and got the real deal, although it was a Canadian copy.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Does exactly what It says it will. Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. (4-8 hours). Battery life is great. 6-8 hours. Can still use them while recharging. Sound quality is great.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to a friend.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I love this movie when I watched it at my Pastors house with his family and mine, so I just had to buy it and a couple others my kids love them as well. They can't wait to watch it as a family again.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Very lightweight case but will still be a little hefty from the Kindle itself.<br /><br />The stand-up feature is very nice, it will take some adjusting to make sure the flap stays in the groove securely (or it will flop over- also make sure to have it on a solid flat surface or this will not work), but if you want a lightweight case you will just have to deal with it. If I was going to be super concerned with that I would have bought a more heavy duty case that would click in better but that would defeat the purpose.<br /><br />All in all very satisfied, I do wish that it had a strap, but again that would affect the weight issue. Perfect for around the house usage.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|If you like Pulse, you`'ll love Flipboard. Like Pulse it combines all your favorite periodicals into one place with some nice features. You can save articles to the \\"Pocket\\" to read later. This app can use a lot of data. Be sure and whitelist on your clean-up utility. This app is one of my favorite \\"reads\\".
1608871045|5.0|Exactly what the Batman lover asked for.<br />apparently there is a word minimum for reviewing purchases that I was previously unaware of.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|Lilo and Stitch is a wonderful movie. It has humor, and feels. Both DVDs in this &#34;Big Wave Edition&#34; are filled with special features. Good stuff. I recommend to all!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|love it! I cant wait to see what they come up with next! get it play it love it spread it like a plague!!
B005VPRETE|5.0|I didn't know they made girl legos but I love these.  I bought this for my grand daughter but I am thinking of getting me the set myself.
0399245030|5.0|we are huge oliver jeffers fans. and this is another story my son just loves to read. its a great story of friendship and caring.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|You would think that Adobe as big as they are could come up with a better app than this. Nice resolution but it will not save your recent views very long.
032147404X|4.0|This book is ideal for a someone who just wants to know how to accomplish a particular act without having to read a whole chapter to find out. Short and to the point. Perfect for what I am looking for.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I enjoed this story and world enough that I have the original paperbook and now kindle versions. I recommend this book and the series!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it works great!  Never have any trouble on my Kindle.  Highly recommended.  Great, fast, fun, app. Download it now.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I find it a wonderful  tool to be able to change locations so I can see the weather where the person I'm talking to is. It is interesting to see the weather around the country.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game. you get to upgrade your stuff like your character and just power ups. I prefer this game for a lot a people who are gameres!
B004UID2LC|4.0|You must have this app. I`m surprised it's free. After wasting time getting signed in on iMesh today I decided to give it a look. I am thinking about selling my PC. My Kindle gets it done. This app has a powerful search engine. Sample the video. If it's a still, better the sound quality. Long press and select MP3 and it starts your download. You hear a notification when it's done. Beautiful!! Enjoy your Kindle.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My wife said this movie was great so I purchase it for Christmas and we love it! Five star rated!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The title says enough. I heard all the so called \\"hype\\" so why not read it? I'll tell u.... Its too much like twilight but add painfully horrible to read sex scenes and there you go. Hopefully the next book I read has more originality.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|A fascinating glimpse into the life of a damaged, lovable and believable man. The romance between the two characters is fun and diverting.  I am glad to note the improvements in editing with only one error remaining in book three where Anastasia notes that she wipes her hand over the back of her mouth.  I loved the books.  I will keep them in my favorite file.
B005LAII1C|3.0|Sometimes when you see previews the movie looks great. However, you get and watch the movie, the previews, or trailer<br />are the best parts of the movie. That's my opinion on this flick.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I tried and tried to like this book. I got to chapter 2 and was still bored. I would not recommend it.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Althought this movie had 2 of my favorite actors, it was an utter disappointment.  It didn't really &#34;go anywhere&#34; in the plot development.
1439107955|5.0|This isn't you 8th grade reader but I find it totally fantastic. A little at a time, is how I go thru this. Pretty much a mind blower
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|As an adult reader l found this to be a pleasant change of pace. Interesting, entertaining, never slow.<br />No horror, no gore, no tears. Just a pleasant & fun story of fantasy.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I had originally heard a few of the singles and finally decided to buy the entire album and i was not disappointed.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Saw the previews of this on TV and thought that we would check it out. It's better than the previews, and a good addition<br />to our collection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed reading. I Found this novel to be even better than the first. Can't wait to read fifty shades freed
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|One  GREAT book perfect for kids whatever it is this book is a pretty darn good book I would recommend it for kids
B005HSL626|5.0|love it I've even unlocked all the blades and backgrounds all in 3 days. awesome so cool best game .
0545265355|5.0|I had an avid reader to loved this boxed set.<br />This is good read for upper elementary (really middle school).<br /><br />E.Tredway<br />Michigan
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My son loved the movies for Christmas!  The price was wonderful.  If I had not found the movies for the price here at Amazon, I wouldn't have purchased the. I checked at WalMart and the price was triple.
B009LY72LQ|5.0|lots of little parts, but can do several different doll ideas. My daughter loves this set. I bought her another.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I had always wanted this app ever since I saw my friend play it on her iphone! I was so excited that they had brought it to amazon products! This is an amazing app!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Considering how many features this has and the price as well as the weights its your best bang for the buck. Still not a high end gaming mouse like the razars and mad cats. But it does have a macro record and playback which is awesome for many games and it has infinite key combos for one button, like you can have one button do ctrl + shift + alt +f + g and be like some sort of combo move for a gamer, i absolutely love this mouse and ive had a few razars and logitecs. Has dual sensors for accuracy and 8000 dpi more than a lot of expensive mice. Has pulsating anchor which can have millions of color combinations. I highly recommend this mouse. with all the weights in it isnt the heaviest but enough for me im used to having batteries in my mice so its a nice feel. The left and right buttons are ultra sensitive so if you have heavy fingers or like to claw the mouse be careful.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|yeah sure its got good graphics and all but it only lets you play one time and thats only for 15 minutes
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Hd video quality was great  that's why I'm giving it 5 stars. However I didn't like the movie as such. Not for young kids below 10 years old.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I play it every day. I got to buy elf tricky for 95000 coins. I know that's a lot of coins.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Not quite as good as the previous Lincoln Lawyer novel, but still a fun read, does grab you at times
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I rarely, if ever, write a review but felt I had to share my experience here.  This is a great toy!  My 4 kids, my husband and myself all enjoy it tremendously.  A neighborhood friend came over and always asks to play video games but when he started to play Perplexus Epic, he stopped asking for video games!  I am awaiting the Perplexus original that I ordered and also ordered the Perplexus Rookie for my youngest daughter. It is well worth the money!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book, collection of stories, or however you choose to put them together is freaking amazing. More, more, more, and more. Can I send you a Redbull in hopes of you writing more,and faster! With this, my first book of Hugh's, he has gained a lifetime fan. I will read everything he throws at me.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|if u like angry birds and starwars u will luv this game every character but one has a diferent costume and power
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I didn't read this book as a lad but I'm glad I finally have. I can't wait to read it with my son
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book left me speechless. Once i finished it i just sat for a minute to try and wonder what really that book meant. Now all i want to do is see the movie which probably isnt as good as the book, they never are, and i think i would recommend this to anyone. Its a great read.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have seen this movie twice aready.  It is a great story of faith, courage, and sacrificial love.  Although the purose of the hunger games is brutal and evil, the violence is carefully presented; it is not unnecessarily gorey and is an integral part of the story line. The endng is well done and leaves one &#34;hungry&#34; to watch a sequel.  The herorine is inspiring.  I would definatey rate this 5 stars, but would rate it &#34;R&#34; and recommend it for adults and more mature teens only, due to the violent content.
B008QTV3X0|3.0|The show is excellent.  Downloading HD (which costs more per episode) wasn't worth the extra money.  Some episodes were fine, but when they froze up, there was little you could do.  It was extremely frustrating.
B009JZOOKO|4.0|I read the book about a year ago and wondered how the author's style would translate to film.  Thankfully, I don't feel they really attempted to do so other than the exception of O's narration, and it really was not a part of the book...just a nice touch.  Overall, very satisfied with the film and particularly certain surprises!
1781161097|5.0|This is a wonderul book for your collection if you are a fan. My dad loved it and I can't wait to check it out.
B009GX6TMA|5.0|For me Nick and Schmidt are two of the best sitcom characters to come along in a long long time.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was awesome I love it  it reads  awesome it was aol cop awesome u could read it 2<br />A
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Who would have thought I would not be able to put down a novel about North Korea?  The last 100 pages will leave you breathless, and the first 100 pages will leave you wanting to re-read the book as soon as you finish.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh this app is amazing on kindle fire! its way better than temple run because it is cooler and more fun!! great for like all ages I would say. Get it....it's free!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a story of finding love when you are not looking for it and love at first sight. This was a great read, I can't believe it was a freebie. Wish there was a follow up book about their marriage with kids.
B00AKKGX4W|3.0|What I really liked about this book is that I got to the wedding day, and wow! There was more. The h and H have made up, and they marry, but rather than just the HEA, we keep going towards a really HEA after the biggest test of all for both of them. I had serious reservations about the H using the h's secret to rescue someone else, particularly as he knew how badly such public revelations by someone else close to her in the past had scarred her (sorry, am trying to explain myself without revealing the story!). Having said that, I also have to say that the question of would he or wouldn't he, and how would the h react, certainly kept me reading.<br /><br />Another minor irritation was this grown man's frequent regression to childhood, but I think the real problem was that the middle part of the story was probably a bit too drawn out. There was too much introspection, a lot of it a repetition of things the h or H had already ruminated on, and this did tend to bog the story down for me rather than drive it forward.<br /><br />That said, I must also say I had no trouble finishing the book - that is to say, I didn't get the the point of wanting to put it down but was happy to keep reading to the end. Give it a go.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is both fun and addictive.  The dragons and decorations are colorful and interesting--more are added as you advance through the levels of the game.  If you are penniless, you'll have to resist the consistent urge to \\"buy\\" with hard cash.  Stay patient and you can have great fun with this game and zero cash expenditures.  Purchases from Amazon are very easy if you just can't resist--a bit too easy if your child is using your device!  I also play Dragon Story and I find Dragonvale to be missing the social aspect but very strong on the breeding and decorations portions of the game.  I've found that the two games complement one another--one much more social and the other much more involved with breeding and decorations.  The first part of the game is a slow slog where you battle with your own impatience until game-generated coins balance the game coin expenditures.  If you're fortunate enough with your breeding program to have game-generated coins flowing steadily, you'll start to have great fun!
B0007P0LPC|4.0|Enjoyed the ballet and love Fonteyn and Nureyev as I saw them perform live many years ago and is a reminder of  teir talent
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm not going to try to review the movies here. I loved them and was looking for a collection of the full trilogy. This collection provides the three movies and a very comprehensive set of special features for about the price I'd expect to pay for just one of the movies. My biggest gripe about Blu-ray is that it _can_ do a lot with special features, but most movies don't unless you really dish out for the expensive collectors editions. This buy was an amazing deal and I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed this trilogy of movies.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great item...I love  it.... Great transaction.  Don't know what more I can put.  5 Star transaction too. Thank you again.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|you knew how it would turn out. Just took a long time to get there. Of course he was rich and she is beautiful.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|So heart warming and touching. This is my first Colleen Hoover book and it definitely will not be my last!
B0081KZ20E|5.0|Love books like this that depict trade craft and clever plots.  I would def recommend this to any fans of spy thrillers.
0307730697|5.0|I developed a man-crush for Adam as I read through this book.  He seems like a great combination of strong convictions and heroism, yet tenderhearted for those in need.  This is a great inside look one of the people that are willing to do what very few are.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I saw the movie, liked it, so I thought I'd start at the beginning and see if the books were as good.  I liked the 1st person approach to the story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great item...I love  it.... Great transaction.  Don't know what more I can put.  5 Star transaction too. Thank you again.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Not as nail biting as some of Lee Childs books about Reacher. Still it was enjoyable. A fast, good read on a rainy day.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|An amazingly detailed book on a war that quite possibly happen. The stories of survival are mind blowing. It really shows how much of animals we are as humans.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Seriously, you could easily beat someone to death with this thing, no need to stab or cut with it.  It's very beefy.  It showed up very sharp, as well.  The grip is very grippy, which is good.  Overall, I'm quite impressed with this knife, especially give the price point.<br /><br />My only real issue with it is that hard to sharpen recurve blade shape.  Make it more of a spear or clip point and it's a five star knife.
0525953728|5.0|I blew through this book in 3 days, as I couldn't put it down.  If you are the least-bit interested in this subject matter, I would suggest reading it, as it helps dispel some of the misinformation out there about the mission.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing story.  Love conquers all!  I have read all<br />three in the triology.  Very original love story.  Re read two times.

B00APUYWYA|3.0|Funny but not that funny. Great cast but the movie just didn't live up to what I have hoped for.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|since i have a lot off friends that read this book i gave it a try but found it a real dumb book and did not finish it, soft porn for women in a bad way.
6304806418|4.0|I bought it for a friend who really wanted it. He stopped looking when he say the same video for $40.00.  I didn't tell him how little I paid for it so I got more brownie points than I should have.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Being a &quot;Babyboomer&quot; I consider being spoiled a privledge and this game did it. I ran it straight through without stopping, lucky vacationing me. It was highly entertaining in it`s side games and visual effects. The guide was there when I got befuddeld so it was relaxing and kinda made me feel smart! Thanks you heads for the cheap thrills. Adios, hasta la vista, requerdos a todos.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put it down.  Raced through it and re read it.  Hope there is a book four.  Can't wait.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Great item...I love  it.... Great transaction.  Don't know what more I can put.  5 Star transaction too. Thank you again.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is Addictive ! The pop-up ads are a little aggravating but I can live with them. I would definitely recommend this game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|great story just as i hoped for from a great writer, as good as all his other books just loved it
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The author does not know the area she sets the story in.  I didn't care about the characters. Lot's of details are inaccurate.  And it isn't even good erotica.  Snooze....
B008AK8FHM|5.0|a must read! A story of determination and how wonderful the human body actually is. I could not put this book down.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Functional, and compatible for iPhone 4s. Good to use to hold the phone for a quite while. Generally, it is good for this price.
B00942S4OY|5.0|My daugher absolutely loves One Direction.  She really wanted this CD for Christmas.  She sings all the songs with joy.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I couldn't put this down once I started it....and the club meeting is months off.  Really enjoyed this, though a bit depressing, for this past holiday season.
B004OR1XGK|4.0|By far the most easy to read software construction book I have read. Gives you enough depth and width to teach you something new regardless of previous programming experience. I recommend this to other front-end developers.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This game gives you many different scenarios to keep you inyerested and challenged. It can be frustrating all the while addicitively pleasant.
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|I'm not quite sure the film answers the implied question the title suggests, but it certainly does a great job of delivering an interesting take on growing up. Charlie (Logan Lerman) is a high school freshman re-entering the system after a mysterious past. Mild mannered and avoiding confrontation, he has no friends but for a sympathetic English teacher (Paul Rudd). Finally he meets friendly seniors, a gay kid named Patrick (excellent Ezra Miller) and his step-sister Sam (Emma Watson, negating any question of could she succeed after \\"Harry Potter\\").<br /><br />Both are shunned by the cool kids but provide their own entertainment and have an extended circle of \\"hippie-type\\" friends. Their music and literature is different and Charlie, an aspiring writer, soaks it all in. He falls hard for Sam, but like Charlie, she has a past and a reputation that still haunts her. Patrick has a boyfriend on the football team that will cause the expected problems when it is discovered.<br /><br />Director/writer Stephen Chbosky hits all the right notes as the trio and classmates grind their way through the school year. Along the way, discoveries are made, feelings are hurt and love is found. And of course, secrets come out. None of this is necessarily new of course. I suspect anyone with a high school memory will find something familiar. Perhaps that is why the movie resonates so strongly. That and nicely paced direction and superlative performances.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer from Summit Entertainment has an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 vs. the original 1.85:1.  The resolution is the usual 1080p.  It looks fine if a bit uneven.  I was expecting the movie to be a bit sharper given the 35mm original film.  In particular some of the shots in low light seem affected.  Overall, it isn't terribly distracting.  The lossless audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The film is dialog driven so we can forgive the limited use of the surrounds.  Overall the sound is very stable and without issue.  Extras include a couple commentary tracks.  One with the director/writer.  Another with the director and cast members.  There are some deleted scenes, some interviews and more..  Extras include a couple commentary tracks.

1589795474|5.0|Bought with the intent to learn more about budgeting and learning a hell of a lot more.<br />This books sets the guidelines for being successful in life no matter what profession you have.<br />Before people complain about the economy and how we should taxing rich they read this book and understand that the most affluent and wealthiest are going to be your middle class American pie family that looks like everyone else. They are simply work smart AND HARD.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Really like the plotting and the characters have more depth and interest than the typical bad or good guys in so many shows.  I love the way the show wrestles with moral ambiguities
1609611543|5.0|Bought this and the new cookbook. Some repetition in the cookbook.  Fascinating subject.  Shared with my cardiologist.  If I was only getting one, recommend the cookbook, because, I think , it covers the same, as the original, and then more!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|Badly written, appalling storyline, even the sex becomes boring because there's so much of it.  I only read it because I read the first one and felt like I had to find out what happens next.  Wish I hadn't bothered.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My daughter and I love this game, it is fun and very addicting :-) she loves collecting the prizes and is collecting some.
0385738773|5.0|This series is wonderful, I am saving it for my son for when he can read it. It's addicting and well written.
B00356CO1E|4.0|I'm a regular gym class attendee, but I recently had to stop going to my regular class due to school and work. I just finished Level 1, and I really got a good workout! Even though it's only a half hour (the classes I attend are an hour), I feel like I can do this more frequently than my gym routine on my own time. I'm looking forward to the next level!<br />I also am now curious about her Yoga DVDs.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am an adult and usually find YA books very limited in the depth of their characters. This book is a big exception.  I have already recommended it to many more of my adult friends.  The dialogue in this book is wonderful, things characters say to one another are not at all predictable, they are unexpected and original and ring absolutely true.  Loved this book!! I can't wait to read more by John Green
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love Nicholas Sparks! Every one of his books l have read have pulled at my emotions. Happy, sad, exciting, heartwarming, funny, terrified (not that it's a horror or anything, but I got scared for the characters) are all things you can expect when you read this book. All the books of his that I have read have been that way. The only reason I gave this book a four out of five is because I wish he had finished the story. I mean, you assume what the ending is and as for the big picture know what happens, but I want the intimate details. I want to know how exactly things happen. Other than that I completely loved this book! I didn't realize when I was reading the last word of the book because I felt like there was more I wanted to know of the story. I couldn't put this book down. It is basically all I did today,and I really enjoyed it!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a pretty good book . I liked it.  Liked the whole story. I would recommend it to my friends.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best of the first three for sure. Never lets you down and always keeps you on your toes. Winter is coming!
0385742886|5.0|This whole series is good, I am keeping it for my son for when he is old enough to read it. Well written and addicting.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|I was hoping someone would make the Kinect better in small rooms and Nyko did just that. The zoom does what it says it will do, however there are some draw backs when using it.<br />There is some interference with the kinect motion capture so you have to make sure you adjust and set up your kinect again even though the manual says you don't have to do anything but snap it on.  Its not perfect.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|First time reading a book on an ereader and LOVED IT!! Definitely helpful to have on my vacation and the drive back home!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|For once I actually liked the third book almost more than the first. This book does so many good things. Of course it's not perfect, but I really envy the character development of Christian and Ana. It's the strongest aspect of the book and something done that right can really make the novel lesson as a whole.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Very good game doesn't lag just wish that it gave more energy great graphics overall very responsive to the touchscreen clear hud only complaint is the energy once again
1455519006|5.0|The book arrived in great condition. Then, upon opening, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I looked forward to my reading time each day.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a movie for everyone to see. There are 845 reviews about this movie because this theatrical event impels the viewers to share the experience with anyone. The movie is very well written, scored and produced. It had me in anticipation, laughing and crying. It is a top movie and although I am sure many reviews reveal the plot I can only say that this is a movie that you do not want to know the story. Just purchase it watch it and share it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a great read, had several great twists. I have not read King in awhile and this was well worth the read!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kids love it and it's great to pass the time while waiting, and their giggles when it's my turn is priceless!
B000002UZ1|5.0|This was bought as a gift for a dear friend (we went to high school together) and I wanted to give her something that would bring back great memories.  This is a wonderful collection!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Hard to put down excellent story on someone that was abused learns how to love and trust again. The suspense keeps you reading.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I really love the Vibe case for my Kindle. Whether I'm using it on my lap or sitting at the table, desk or bar I can situate my Kindle to view exactly the way I want it. It makes me feel more secure carrying it places with me. I don't worry about scratches or damages to my kindle. It is a nice feature that just closing the cover shuts the kindle down. I would most definitely reccomend this product for your Kindle fire HD. Forgot to mention how securely it fastens into the cover.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Well done, most helpful and encouraging.  If you are considering the self publishing route - start here!<br />You have nothing to loose!
1451695195|5.0|My mother-in-law was so happy to get this book and I can not wait to get to read it too!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Don't waste your time or money this has to be one of the worst books ever written in the world!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Best.book.ever. seriously. So emotional. A definite must read for teens and adults alike, if you don't love this book. I don't understand why
B005PK1G76|5.0|This has been a great addition to our strollers. It's easy to take on and off, and depending on the type of stroller you have, you might be able to keep it on when you fold it up. As other reviewers say, the organizer does get a little deformed if you aren't super careful with it, but that doesn't effect the purpose it serves. It's easy to bend the wire back to where it belongs if it gets a little crooked.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Love this movie.  just watched it again on the weekend. Cast and music are the best.  Will never tire of watching it.  Saw it on Broadway, which is always wonderful, but enjoy the movie just as much!
B002ZFQD0E|4.0|I love a few of the songs on this CD.  A few of the others are a bit &#34;odd&#34; but I still love her voice.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a romantic comedy and a action book because it was really long it took me time to get into it.but I don't worry about it once I read the full story. It was a great book because it was really serious yet funny! I loved it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Totally exciting! It's one of my top ten favorite books of all times. I can't wait to read the next book
B00AAQ7JNA|5.0|Let's be honest... in the creation of this Blu Ray, corners were certainly cut in the audio quality put onto the disc.  Was this a mistake or on purpose?  I do not know... however... this is a technical issue.  Step away from that.  Is it listenable audio even if not all it could have been? YES.  May you have to crank your system to get it loud?  YES.  Could it use more bottom end?  YES.  Does the mix do the songs and musicianship full justice?  No. But, does it still sound good?  YES.  It is funny... most people are buying MP3s which dumb down the audio quality... and then are going to worry about the sound quality here?  To most people, the sound issues on this Blu Ray are not going to make the product unenjoyable.<br /><br />This product is about the concert and the documentation of the Loud Tour.  I am so thankful it exists in a flawed version rather than not at all.  Why?  Because it was THE BEST concert I EVER saw.  I am over 40 and have been attending concerts for decades and have seen the best of the best and average 10 arena concerts a year live and countless at smaller venues along with countless ones viewed on TV or DVD/Blu Ray.  Rihanna's Loud Tour had EVERYTHING you could possibly want in an arena show.  Great stage that was neither simplistic nor overly complicated... it just looked great and complimented the show and artist.  The large movable circle screens, outlined stage lighting, synched video footage, and all the rest was great.  Then you add in the occasional props for certain songs.  You add in backup dancers used appropriately in and between songs.  You ensure the music is played by top notch musicians including a world class guitarist in Nuno Bettencourt (Extreme).  Add in spot on backing vocals to keep the sound thick and accurate to the recorded versions.  Now, add in the fact that all these awesome musicians end up creating versions of the songs that surpass the studio version in quality (unfortunately slightly harder to tell with the poor audio mix, I will admit).  Add in elevating stage areas and treadmills, etc... have the stage configuration change regularly... change the outfits regularly... and add some great use of smoke, lighting and even a little pyro and even confetti.  It basically had everything you would want in a concert... and all this is before even mentioning Rihanna.  She rocks... her moves are great, she is fun to watch, and she never gets enough credit for her singing.  Unlike the lip synchers out there, she does her moves and her singing and she doesn't hide where she weaves in and out of the backup singers.  Rihanna has a very unique voice and a perfect blend of control and swagger and looseness in her performances.  She is as made to be on stage as Michael Jackson was.  And she commands the same stop and watch attention.  To top all of that off... Rihanna has a crazy amount of hits and Loud was probably the last tour that will feature a mix of hits and a few other great songs that were not big singles but kick butt live.  By now, Rihanna can fill an entire show with just her hit singles... and the only negative will eventually be (probably starting with this next tour) that she will have to leave many great songs unplayed.  Not a bad problem to have.  Anyway... why focus on the negatives of this release compared to the positives??  It was imperative that this tour be documented and available for historical purposes. If you judge this release by the show itself... you will LOVE it... and if someday they release a better audio blu ray... I bet you will buy that too because this show is THAT GOOD!<br /><br />It is sad that the concert itself is not earning the 5 stars it easily deserves purely due to the technical issues many are pointing out.  As a concert, honestly, even trying here, I still couldn't possibly say enough to convey how great the Loud Tour was.  I saw it live... 4th row center in Chicago, it was beyond amazing... and being able to re-live it with this Blu Ray really makes it my favorite Blu Ray in my collection... problems and all.y makes it my favorite Blu Ray in my collection... problems and all.
B003U6Z7IG|5.0|A true classic. Had the hardcover when I was a kid.  Was my mother's, sister's and my favorite.  Brings back wonderful memories of my sister, mother and me reading it over and over.  A cozy treat, especially on a cold winter's nite.  Very heartwarming.  Will always love this book!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love the John Corey books, although DeMille took wisecracking to the extreme this time. Good suspense and does seem based on real-life events. If you have enjoyed the John Corey books before, you should like this.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very good read, there are well developed characters, and a never slow story line.<br /><br />My only issue was the ending, I personally found it annoying.<br /><br />A very good book.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|App does exactly what the description states. As easy to use and approachable an interface as you want it to be; technically inclined users will find myriad submenus and customization options throughout, though it performs well with basic settings.very satisfied

1451620829|5.0|I bought this book for my brother as a Christmas gift, he in return had purchased it for me also.
B009E3EY38|3.0|The music is of course phenomenal but they could have done a better job with the sound. I am not sure why they would have not chosen to get the best in business to record this event but apparently they did not. As for the video, that is actually not from the concert but from a rehearsal and the quality is really poor.
B005LAII12|5.0|Saw this movie in the theatre, it's hilarious!  I'm a big fan of Seth MacFarlane! It's irreverant, politically incorrect & offensive...just what you'd expect from MacFarlane!  If you are not a fan of MacFarlane & his hit TV shows, it might not be for you.  Don't expect a cute movie about a talking teddy bear!  If you don't know what you are getting into, you'll be shocked & possibly offended.  I suggest you watch his TV shows: Family Guy, American Dad, & The Cleveland Show, first, and if you are OK with those, you'll dig the movie.  I bought this along with the 8 inch talking TED bear, & tied them together as a gift.  (I think the talking TED bear was overpriced & overrated)
B003YL4LYI|4.0|unlike many of my friends, who told me this book was awful and they only skimmed it (really?  what's the point?) I enjoyed this and the previous installment of the series.  There are a lot of characters in the story overall and I appreciate that Martin tries to give them all time.  I also appreciate that the super-gory is left out for the most part.  I don't need to read battle scene after battle scene, but I enjoy the backstory and motivations of the characters.  I can't wait for the next one to be finished so I can find out what happens.
B005Q1W0ZQ|3.0|I loved season 1, but season 2 had so much soap opera melodrama, it was almost laughable . From the officer impregnating the house maid to Matthew' s &#34;Miraculous&#34; cure so he was no longer crippled, to Lavinia' s &#34;convenient death from the Spanish flu, I thought I was watching a Mexican reflexively . excessively cornet!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|CHALLENGING AND FUN. PLAY WITH A FRIEND OR ALONE WITH THE COMPUTER. IT IS A FUN GAME EITHER WAY. AWESOME
B000050HTO|5.0|I never listened closely enough to Dylan's lyrics when he originally recorded many of the classic works included in this collection.  Shame on me.  What I missed was A LOT.  This is a fine collection that reawakened my appreciation of both his music and his insight and wry sense of humor.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Star Wars angry birds is the most fun game I have ever played on the fire hd look great plays great and is lots of fun I have a friend who has a Ipad but the game look so much better on my fire that he plays mine it lloks 3D
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Because yes, this series really is that good. Ms. Gabaldon, please write faster!  Can't wait for the next installment!  Lord John series is good, too.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|My son loves this, he says that when he battles this bey blade against his friend's bey blades, he always wins. LOL
B005HSL626|4.0|this is awesom, really enjoy playing this game, it's a workout for your hands. real good if you have arthritis. and it's free..
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I am so glad I bought this cover.....makes my kindle fire look an feel like a real book.  It is beautiful.
B00962341U|5.0|Leona Lewis vuelve con mas fuerza que nunca, Sin duda  uno de los mejores discos del 2012, no escucharlo seria un error.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Noise quality is great, I hooked it up to my Bose iPod dock in my kitchen so I can hear my Frank Sinatra tunes during Saturday breakfast.  It's keeping me happy!  So happy I bought a second one for my boyfriend's office!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is not my normal puzzle game style, but I tried it and I love it. Its cute and fun and I would recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book. Some of it is far fetched and seems unrealistic what ones reaction would be when put in that certain situation but eh.
B0053TMP24|4.0|The two fail account goes further than the poor who said he believed that the movie was not the rich
B0000YEEGM|5.0|We like movies like AS GOOD AS IT GETS where one of the main characters is different like with O.C.D (think Bill Murray in WHAT ABOUT BOB) or autistic like in ADAM or Sigorney Weaver in SNOWCAKE, or both main characters in MOZART AND THE WHALE (one with autism and the other bipilor). Another good one is BENNY AND JOON again with both main characters in a romantic movie being different and yet loveable. A great one is LAST WORD about a social misfit who writes poetic suicide notes for other people for money. These movies all seem like comedies but take on a more serious tone if you know someone with one of more of these symptoms.
1400049628|4.0|I must admit to being one of those zombie heads who just cant' get enough zombie material, be it from movies, games, books, comics/graphic novels, what have you (there are even 2 great zombie themed metal bands I know of called Deceased and Necrophagia). But even for us zombie freaks there has been entirely too much zombie stuff all over the place lately. Thus it was that I've been avoiding reading this book, because of the amazing amounts of zombie stuff to come out in the last 10-15 years most of it is garbage. Not so here! This book is entirely different and very well written. Its funny and yes, I dare say it, informative (if something about a zombie apocolypse can indeed be informative). I was riveted from page one. I like how creative people can be. In a day and age when you think everything has been done you find something that takes you by surprise. I know I'm really late to this book, so many have already read it. I'm going to have to get a copy of World War Z next. Max Brooks is awesome, his fiollow up to this is \\"must reading\\" for me.
B005RDF2NA|5.0|Shrek is Shrek. Well made, fabulous characters and who can't enjoy and adore the ending. Truly a delightful way to past some time.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Brings me back to when I was a kid and would go to the arcade to play this game. The only drawback is getting use to the control mechanism. It is very sensitive. Otherwise this is much like the original Pac Man game.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Decided to start reading the series after I saw the new Jack Reacher movie with Tom Cruise. Even though Tom Cruise does not fit the character as described in the book (Tom is older and much shorter with dark as opposed to sandy hair) I couldn't help picturing him in my mind as I read the book. This however did not hinder my enjoyment. This was the first in the series and it didn't dissapoint. The lead character is a bit over the top, and some of the situations are pretty implausable but overall it was a fun read. I plan to continue with the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the best book, what a wonderful love story with such a difficult topic that the main character deals with. Don't hesitate to buy this book.. LOVED IT.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Made me wish I had a passport. It was funny, sad, and inspiring.  All the actors do a superb job.
B001NLJ33K|3.0|I love MIami Vice the old one tho...this was a very weak movie they didn't even fully explore the beauty of Miami ;/
B002JWD6AS|4.0|This was an easy read with a cute story. It had a predictable ending but was still enjoyable and satisfying.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've fought my wife about this book since day one. I finally read it. Wow. Talk about holding your breath and hoping against hope that Katniss can overcome. The anger and frustration with the Capitol for the callous way they enjoy the games. Everything about this story pinged some part of my mind or heart. Great read. Now if you'll excuse me; I have book two to dive headfirst in to.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Best show ever......Awesome cast and writers.  WELL DONE is every way<br /><br />My FAVORITE - Harvey (Gabriel Macht) of course!  Thursday's on USA Network
1409136612|5.0|Told in a completely honest and humorous tone....about dealing with family life and how people are sadly often taken for granted.  But it is never to late to fight  the good fight and stop putting up with the &#34;&#34;albatrosses&#34;&#34; around one's neck.  If this quick read doesn't inspire one to reevaluate their circumstances, maybe nothing will.
B0095R64AO|5.0|I wasn't sure about this one but it was a very cute and funny movie. My husband liked it and he is a good critic and he doesn't like cheesy movies.
0765325950|1.0|Yes, I hate to give a bad review to a good book here, but the only way to get the attention of the publisher is by hoping to affect their sales. If this were available as an ebook, I would buy it for the $20. Sending a letter to the publisher will just get ignored.<br />I have read all the books in this series and love it. However I can not carry a hardback around with me during the day, and with young children, my evening reading is limited. I have to read in ebook format. By not releasing an ebook for three months, TOR is going to force me to download the book from the first scanned copy I can find. I am against piracy, and think artists, authors and such should be paid for the fruits of their labors. But, I have waited patiently for this book and all the others, and will read it at my first opportunity. Maybe I just mail Mr. Sanderson a $10 check once I find the book for free. Tor, you can kiss my b**t.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have the original Kindle Fire and have been using the Facebook app for over a year now with no problems. Last night I found that the app now takes me to the &quot;MOBILE-WEB&quot; version of Facebook. After downloading this app, it seems even more out-dated than the previous one! Ugh... ridiculous. I'm assuming the app was updated for the new Kindle but what about the rest of your loyal customers, AMAZON!?! THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND SOON.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Just started playing.  Had to buy some peanuts to make playing easier although I could have just struggled without.  Got it for my son and he loves it so I guess it's a good one.
B007G92QGO|4.0|I enjoyed this book but oh that father did really frustrate me and the fact that a law man got off scot free
B006O6EOII|5.0|It was a gift for a teenage girl who loves Monster High. She loves it and I was happy with the service!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|\\"A Feast for Crows\\" I think suffers from wanting to develop underlying characters, making the reader change their minds of certain characters and setting up the storyline for book 5. Without trying to do any spoilers I found one character for me went from being a bad guy to being a good guy (up to a certain extent) and another character going from a good guy to becoming a bad guy. Then there is another character that is shown to be a blithering idiot, for he or she thinks he/she are being clever and sneaky when in all reality the character is as transparent as glass. If you been reading the book series then you can probably make out who I am writing about, but like I said I don't want to give out any spoilers that is why I didn't use any names. There a couple of characters that to me don't serve any purpose other than shoring up the storyline, but I could be wrong for I still haven't read book 5. I do say this book isn't as bad as some people are saying that is, but I do like books about Knights, Dragons, Magic and adventures. I do think this book probably won't adapt to well for mini-series unless they merge this with book five, if they don't then some of the people who play those characters are going to have a nice season to relax.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|My daughter loved it!  It arrived on time and perfectly packaged before Christmas.  I would recommend this to others thanks!
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I'm still confused about the rave reviews for this movie. I thought it was very strange, to say the least.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I LOVE Slyvia's other books! (I just wanted to get that out there.) But this book was just a huge \\"no\\"; there was no originality to this book. She only made the characters from 'Fifty Shades of Gray' more \\"f\\"ed-up. The lead woman is needy, whiny, and has way too much baggage to even entertain an idea of a relationship. But wait! The main guy has way more baggage and the two together equals sex scenes that kind of make you cringe and go \\"really?? Do you want to have sex after revealing that\\"; and way too many over dramatic scenes where she storms out and he shows his possessive crazy side. Sooooooo not hot. In conclusion don't buy it, just go and read the original stories over.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love using facebook on my iphone and my kindle works just fine! It makes life easier you don't have to sign in every time on the website
0765325950|1.0|I feel conned.  Amazon pushes the Kindle down my throat every time I visit the website and I finally break down and buy one.  Now, one of the biggest books in fantasy comes out and guess what?  No Kindle version until April.  I'm giving this book one star until such time as I can buy it on Kindle.  This kind of crap only promotes pirating IMO.
B0006ICF9A|5.0|awesome  5.1 surround sound mix. I have listened to the cd hundreds of times ,however the dvd a  version is like hearing the album for the first time again, only in 5.1. !! Highly recommended!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a very creative game everyone should play this game (: !! yay oh and I like it because you can build anything you imagine
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Totally addicted to this game. Find myself up all night playing it. Takes a while to complete certain challenges but I guess that makes the game longer. The only problem I have with it is the lack of acorns. Kungfu scrat always stop on the same three choices and its mostly money or if you get lucky 1-5 acorns which is really frustrating seeing how most items are 30-300 acorns. Add more ways of getting acorns and you have a perfect game. Oh and I have a kindle fire hd and NEVER had a problem closing the game but it seems to always glitch when choosing prize for kungfu scrat and when I try to  visit other villages.<br />UPDATE!!!!!! GAME KEEPS GLITCHING ON ME TRIED TO PLAY AND WOULD HAVE TO RE DOWNLOAD AND I'VE RESTARTED MY VILLAGE LIKE 3XS LOST ALL THE ACORNS AND COINS I PURCHASED INCLUDING ALL OF MY ANIMALS, AND SOME TOOK LONG TO COMPLETE,AND ALL OF MY LAND AND FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN THERES PRETTY MUCH NO WAY TO GET IT BACK SO I REALLY FEEL LIKE IVE BEEN SCAMMED. AS SOON AS I SPEND MONEY AND GET MY VILLAGE TO A DECENT SIZE IT STARTS MESSING UP AND I GET A MESSAGE TO REDOWNLOAD AND HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH. REALLY SUCKS. VERY DISAPPOINTED
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I'll be short, sweet, and to the point.<br />If you liked One Direction's album 'Up All Night' like I did, then you should buy this album. I also recommend the Target album for the extra songs -- worth it.<br />There is no question. This music is ear crack. I need it.<br />Plus also, One Direction have grown up. A lot. Not as innocent as 'Up All Night!' It's all new and fresh and wonderful. Honestly, they couldn't have done better for their sophomore album. Dare I say it? It's better than their first.<br />Take Me Home is brilliant, and I couldn't love it more. Keep it coming, boys! Can't get enough. =)
B005XLN97M|5.0|My children loved this toy, It's awesome! I recommend it, It's very pretty and fun too.. Enjoy it... Barbie Rules!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best just keeps on getting better. If you havent started watching this cultural phenomenon, you had better start soon.
193355021X|5.0|This is a terrific book that I highly recommend.<br />Do yourself a favor and give it a read.  You won't be sorry.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|Really has some hard ones, but is fun to get it right.  Makes you do some problem solving.<br />Haven't done the harder ones yet.
014050639X|5.0|I bought this as a nostalgia gift for my sister. We used to rent it from the library constantly when we were little. We would sit reading this book aloud to each other over and over and over again. And I didn't even like reading before this. Now I'm an author!<br />Anecdotes aside, 'Each Peach Pear Plum' is a heart-warming children's book with clever rhymes and adorable pictures. I'm proud to own it, and I will always pull this out for a baby-sitting job.<br />Shipping was great. It came two days early.<br />Give it a chance and see for yourself!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great solitaire<br /> game for any level of play or player. Have spent many hours playing this wonderfully game
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game has very many different levels, and I'm still enjoying<br />many days later, one of the best games I have found so far
B00846REIS|4.0|Much better then Shades of Gray series. I can't wait to read all of  Sylvia Day's books.<br />I really enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was Amazing. I literally Couldn't put it down. Didn't want it to end and can't wait to read the next book
B007SUW24W|5.0|I bought this for my sister for Christmas, and we both listen to it all the time. I might have to buy my own because I keep stealing it from her.<br />Ed Sheeran has a lovely, real voice and his lyrics are the same.<br />I am a proud Sheerio.<br />Try it out!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|IT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED. THE MOVIE KEEPS WITH THE SNOW WHITE STORY IN PART. I COULD NOT STOP WATCHING IT. GREAT MOVIE.
B005LAII12|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY AS HECK. I WASNT TO SURE ABOUT IT. BUT AFTER WATCHING IT AND WATCHING AGAIN THERE IS SOME VERY FUNNY STUFF IN IT
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I'm a big fan of Zeppelin. Saw them when I was 17. Ninth row center at Blackhawk Stadium in Chicago. The best concert I ever saw, and I've seen many. The sound and lighting are so good on the DVD. It was so good that we all watched it twice in a row.
B001NHNG64|5.0|First Lee child book.  Much enjoyed.  Will read more by this author although this is not typically my type of book.
0547884591|5.0|Timothy Ferriss is a Bodhisattva of lifestyle and learning. This book is sometimes provocative, highly informative, and thoroughly entertaining; a compendium of culinary craft and coffee-table book par excellence; a companion for espresso-injected forays into meta-learning madness. Tim's joyful, food-fuelled adventure through the art of learning is a celebration of life and human potential. We are fortunate he has been so willing to take us along for the ride. Long live Tim.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|They really impressed.  Not a low budget but for a studio that isn't in the &#34;big leagues&#34;, they definitely impressed.  If you are a Halo fan - get this movie.
030758836X|3.0|It was a book that held my interest all the way through until the end.  Very anti-climactic.  I was hoping there would be a twist or a dramatic ending, but there wasn't.  I'd give it 3 stars.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book! I liked that the characters didn't show from nowhere and were forgotten. The history really had a continuos flow while keeping me entertained and glued to the novel. Really reccomend. Can't wait for the sequel.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Great for a family night with kids on the couch. My children love the ice age series and this one is just as good as any.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am so taken by the as book! Loved it. I was . Worried because of the  ages of the characters (I have teenagers myself) but the love scenes were written so beautifully
0062511408|5.0|The Alchemist was originally written in Portuguese.  Upon translating the book to Spanish, the book reads a lot smoother I think because Spanish is more like Portuguese than English.  Not to mention we are so sheltered as Americans, that certain comments in the Spanish version have been omitted in the English version...<br />Either way, The Alchemist/El Alquimista is the single most enlightening book I have ever read.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Got this for a friend and ended up using it myself! Oops. We both enjoyed it very much, it was quite good.
B003BA4CAU|5.0|Beautifully acted and directed.  Great scenery.  A good New York movie.  The soundtrack for P.S. is a mix of Irish and current songs.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I travel from building to building for meetings and although it doesn't carry the cache for a dapper business look, but it carries the load comfortably.<br /><br />It holds my HP 17&#34; Envy and all my other stuff stuff.  There are plenty of pockets for organizing.  The padding is well positioned and it's comfortable.  The tiny zippered pockets on the side are too small to put much of anything in.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I think this book is a great opportunities and for me life saving book because well one it tells you words and it is very precise about the words they use like juicy adverbs big verbs and in fact it even tell you what a verb and adverb are so with my own opinion I think this is a wonderful book if you want flow a meaning of a word so have fun and make sure to download this best selling word telling awesome adventure word book bye!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|As I had expected the whole game was quite solid like the original and just really fun. I think the whole cut the rope games are the best apps in this app store. Its nice cause it's actually possible to get all the stars since in some other games it isn't even fun to get them.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Excellent for planning the day and evening. Haven't spent much time since retirement keeps me from having to venture out on bad days.  A very helpful tool.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun story and I would love to read more from this author in the future.
0525478817|5.0|Perhaps, these days, the most important quality I assign to a book, especially a novel, is the emotional effect it has on me. Also important are the quality of the dialogue, particularly when it's a significant part of the book, the originality of the story, the sense I get of the realness, the humanness, of the characters. Considering all of that, John Green's novel, The Fault in Our Stars, is extraordinary.<br />I've seen some assignment of the book to the 'young adult' category of book types. I disagree with that designation, though the book could be read, understood and appreciated by teenagers. (A look at the ages, or references, of many reviewers at amazon.com demonstrates the story's appeal to that reading group.)<br />A story most focused on two teenagers with cancer, they and other characters speak mature universal insights and realities about life, living with cancer, mortality shortened, the emotional stumbling and navigation of all intimately involved characters--parents, other adults, friends, other teens, this book contains so much and gives so much to and for its readers. (As a nurse I have some knowledge and understanding of the severe illness and dying processes.)<br />I read this book in pieces; I couldn't have read it in a couple or three sittings. It's emotional forces--teens with deadly cancer, its humor--gallows and otherwise--the gut-wrenching pain, the development of love between two people knowing of their potential short futures--wouldn't allow me to read this special and amazingly well-written and compassionate story.<br />For me, The Fault of Our Stars lived up to and surpassed its billing, its hype, if you will. For the complete, compelling and surpassing quality of the story, I score it five stars.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|There product came very quickly and has no problems with it. The person who received the gift loved it! The movie is hilarious and is good for all ages.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|this was such a great show. One of my favorite plays. I think the best part is the end when they bring the original case plus the others over the last 25 years together. A must see.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked this up in the hospital hoping to get a good science fiction read.  I was not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />Book 1 had me hooked from the get go.  I couldn't imagine this apocalyptic world these people were living in.  As the series progressed the intricacies and twists grew more profound and haunting.<br /><br />Would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would recommend this for every 5th grader it's super hilarious  and good . The part I really liked was when Greg screamed when he saw the pimple on Abbeys face.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|One of the connectors didn't work for me but the one with the memory card did. Fast transfer of photos from my camera to my iPad. Love it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game it is fun and it kills time when you have nothing else to do and my son loves to watch me play it
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Just as it was in the first expendables; a lot of action. I liked this sequel better, because  swartzeneggar's in it longer than two minutes and the slight appearance of chuck norris was great too.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This story is very inspirational.  It is a book I will read again and again and I will experience another totally different meaning each time.
B007SGM084|4.0|The ladies in my family insisted I get this trilogy.  If you are prudish don't consider this one.  The story line is intertwined with a lot of playing but it does hold one's attention.
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob William Landay<br /><br />While I was reading this book, I hated the times I had to put it down. I thought about it when I couldn't read it and couldn't wait to get back to it.<br /><br />The local district attorney, Andy Barber, is happy with his life until his son Jacob is accused of murder of a fellow classmate. There is a lot going on in this novel and for me, it was such a thought provoking read. This well written novel with intriguing characters and narration by the father, Andy, is extremely addicting.<br />While reading, I was compelled to think about the nature vs. nurture argument; are people born with a predisposition to violence? And as a parent what is your responsibility with your child's actions? Not only did I think about this scenario while I wasn't reading it, I was still thinking about it after I finished - so much so that I couldn't pick up another book to read for a while.<br /><br />It's funny how sometimes I inadvertently read like-themed books back to back, but it incites such interesting Q&A - perfect for discussing in a group setting.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I was debating on which processor to get (This one, or the i7 3770k) and because of the lack of money, I got this instead. I have to say, this processor performs like MAGIC. It was easy to install,and it can run Borderlands 2 and Skyrim both on Ultra settings with my other parts. I can honestly say that this processor was a very good deal, and I would highly recommend this over the very expensive i7 Ivy.<br /><br />CONS: The stock fan + cooler is okay without overclocking, but if you are someone who wants to OC and get as much as possible, I recommend buying a new cooler/ fan.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Daughter asked for this film collection for Christmas and absolutely loved it.  She spent 2 days straight watching Harry Potter.
0061537969|2.0|The only reason I read past the stuffed-animal sexual-assault scene, is that this is the selection for the local book club. I had a hard time taking the book seriously at all after that.  I'd already noticed undertones of animosity towards women, and gotten a pervy vibe too.  And the toy molestation and assault turned out to be just the beginning.  This story has a random assortment of pontificating as well.  I presume the author would like to get his opinion on those topics out in the world, but a novel seems a strange place for them; it affects the flow.  Blogs or articles seem a better medium for those peculiar bits, in my opinion.  The pervy vibe was reconfirmed at the lengthy and repeated description of a 15 year old's breasts (lots of breast description in this book, animals included).  The 15 year old turns out to be a baddie though, so maybe that makes her objectification deserved. Oh, wait, it's okay because it was a DOG whose opinion we were reading.  You can say anything when it's just the thought of a dog.  Really weird book.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Quality watch.  I also have a Electronic Tag and the precision is no better than the Seiko.  For the price I paid during Amazon's Christmas sale, it was a real bargain.  I should have purchased the other colors too.  I expect this watch to last a life time because I still have 2 other Seiko's that are doing just fine.<br />Amazon did their usual best by delivering the watch quickly and undamaged.  I have not had any issues from Amazon ever.<br /><br />Update 8/13/2013:  Watch is still working fine.  Excellent accuracy.  the crystal is perfectly un-scratched.  Because I wear this watch even when I'm doing messy things.  I've had to remove the band to wash it.  I just throw it in with my laundry and it comes out looking like new.  I'm definitely buying another one if I can only decide what color I like, they all look great.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|After getting my boyfriend hooked on Harry Potter, he decided he needed this set on Blu-Ray of course!  He loves them and the quality is great!
B006LSZECO|5.0|At first I thought this book was a simple love story. Boy was I wrong! I recommend this book and even got it as a gift for a friend. It's a great discussion book. Everyone seems to have their own opinion on what happened.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I first heard mention of this book when reading one of Nora Ephron's books. This was one of her favorites. It quickly became one of mine too.
034553154X|5.0|Stunning calendar! The artwork both compliments and enhances the experience of either the HBO series OR the novels themselves-recommended for any fan:)

B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great Mitch Rapp book from Flynn - sorry, but they are far too short, but if longer, I'd be sitting around reading when I should be doing something else.
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|This was a stupid waste of time and money.  I'm a fan of both Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downey Jr., but this was one hot mess of a movie.  I wish I could find something nice to say about it, but I just can't.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Reading the original whisked me away to the times and place of this story's origin.  I will make this a tradition!
B004QX07G4|5.0|A light hearted read that will put a smile on your face and in your heart. Keeps you laughing and smiling
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. I laughed and I cried. I will be looking at her other books. This should so be a movie.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|The way the book is written is interesting, teasing and intense. Can't wait to read the other ones which are already on my kindle. :P
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|&#34;Red&#34; is the greatest movie we have seen in a long time. We have probably watched it 5 times already..<br />Stars, plot & comedic touches are absolutely superb..
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It natuarally flowed from the first book and I read all 3 in about a week. This one was suspenceful
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another fine book by Grisham! I couldn't put it down. Don't start reading this book if you must do something else. You will fail at the other task...
B0000VCZK2|4.0|If Alien Resurrection had never been made I would give it 5 stars.  However, that abomination of a film ends the series. Dont watch it, it will make you cry for the humanity.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is one of the few books I'm going to read again. I really liked similar books (ie: 50 shades and the crossfire series) , but this book exceeded my expectations. Both characters were well developed.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|I bought this for my husband.  We both enjoy the program and I am working on completing the collection to catch the ones we missed.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I bought this for my wife to use since cell phone usage is being curtailed.  And, I bought it with some apprehension since we drive vehicles that are not known for their quiet ride.  Some of the reviews I read were not encouraging.  I've been delighted.  Easy to set up.  Loud enough to hear.  Best of all, when I call into it, as the caller, I don't hear all the background noise, just the person talking - it does a remarkable job of filtering out the noise.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno hit it out the park with this one! Every track is pure gold, i listen to this album constantly on repeat.Kudos to you Mr. Mars
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This book has it all. Brandon Sanderson's ability to build and create imaginative worlds that are not only plausible and believable, but enthralling and breathtaking as well is astounding. He sweeps you up in into a story that is complex, yet fast paced with well fleshed out characters that each have their own distinct voice. Masterful writing of epic fantasy. I finished it in one sitting, I just couldn't put it down! Truly a must read.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|I have really enjoyed this program and want to catch episodes that I missed.I bought it for my husband and we watch it together.
B000068CNX|5.0|Love this season and buying it used was not a mistake, because I got it almost new for an amazing price.  Don't hesitate to buy used, it can save you money and is basically the same thing you will buy new.
B00786XVOG|5.0|the only way it could have been better is to have been their . just a great cocert to watch
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|i loved the soundtrack, i love the movie and i love the music. so now i get to be reminded of the movie often and can listen to the music i love all the time!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the entire trilogy and couldn't wait to read the next one.  However, this one was not quite as steamy as the other two.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I listen to several radio stations outside of my market, and I use TuneIn radio. I love sports talk radio in Dallas and use this app to keep up on the news/hot sports opinions on my favorite Metroplex teams. Record up to an hour of audio to listen to later. Pretty sweet app that I use every day and have never had a complaint.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I thought the ending was rather lacking; however, I did enjoy the book and I'm glad they ended up happy despite the initial shock and disappointment of the first pregnancy.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|&#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; is a quick read and gives a neurosurgeon's description and explanation of his near death experience. His extensive medical credentials and expertise allows Eben Alexander’s to refute the attempts of atheistic scientists to minimize his experience as being educed by drug, coma, base level brain function, or some other dismissive explanation.
B0031R5K68|3.0|I didn't like it as much as his other books.  Felt there was a lot of gratuitous violence which didn't add to the story enough in fact probably made it less enjoyable
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Great watch.  Enjoyed the concept from beginning to end.  Looks like they made an opening to let Robin take an active role.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|If you liked Firefly you may like this. Nathan Fillion has several Firefly incerts you may catch a refrence of here and there. Some Overly Obvious
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly does a brilliant job of humanizing yet keeping the single minded impassioned drive characterization of detective Bosch authentic within a gripping believable mystery. How does he think these stories UP?! Great read!
B005VT42BS|4.0|Simple little product that only gives basic host info, but for the ability to do this on a tablet is pretty neat!
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great movie also reminds me of the untity of countries when the real 9-11 happened in 2001,I will buy it as one the all time greats.
B000002J03|5.0|It is said that you stay with the music you grow up with (to the extent that I have).  I had this as an LP, and the sound quality is much better than I remembered.  A great trip down memory lane.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Great gift For kids my daughter loved it! It kept her busy for hours . The storage box help keep the Legos off the floor .
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like the game. The only problem I am having is saving my progress. If it wasn't for that it would be 5 stars
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this in the midst of pondering the pros and cons of children having it skip much of what we have grown to think of as the extended adolescence necessary in much of privileged US popular culture.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|The movie (director's cut especially) looks great and sounds great. I purchased this for a friend for christmas, mainly cause he's young and needs to learn about the classics. The presentation is nice, small hardcovr book with every version of the movie you can think of with a really nice amount of extras. The artwork in the book is great as well. I have another version of this, and may get this copy in order to get the book itself, great for collecting or for  a conversation piece. I have been getting more blu ray book versions and this one looks great (packaging) and is a must have for any die hard sci fi fans. For literary buffs, although it's based on the Philip K. Dick novel, &#34;do androids dream of electronic sheep&#34; there is a huge huge deviation from the book. So do not prejudge and simply appreciate it for what it is, the movie story line though is compelling There is a lot more depth added as well and so much additional scenes as it's only based on a short story not a full novel. So purists beware. the next part is a spoiler in case u haven't seen it yet. One point of contention betwe4en Harrison Ford and Ridley scott was the &#34;unicorn dream&#34; and how it was suppposed to make us think he is a replicant. Ford says it's better for him to be human, while Ridley seemed to like the ambiguity that it implies. I for one never found the unicorn dream to mean anything. It just seems like  something any man might dream about in a future where animals are priceless commodities. There is the telling of how he wanted an animal for himself but couldn't afford it. so the dream to me didn't imply too much. Maybe cause I am thinking of it in more of a literary sense and not so much as a standalone movie. But other than that this is a definite classic and should be watched and enjoyed by any sci fi fan or harrison ford fan.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Was going to buy the 3rd movie in the store, but for $3 LESS I got all 3 movies on BluRay! Awesome!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone. It is easy to see on the kindle fire and addictive. Not a real challenge but fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once I started the Hunger Games trilogy I couldn't stop reading! Word by word the gripping story keeps you riveted to the pages wanting more. Can't wait to read the conclusion.
