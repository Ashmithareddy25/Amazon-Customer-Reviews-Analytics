B0041T4ML4|4.0|First - you can read this review with confidence - there's no plot spoilers or even a summary of the plot here.    The Windup Girl is a good book - and definitely keep me engrossed from start to finish.  It's an engrossing tale, but not without a few flaws.  As with his book \\"Ship Breaker\\" Paolo Bacigalupi has crafted an extremely deep distopian future that he's set his book in.  Which I found both good and bad.  The good is that it's a truly deep and immersive world that the story is set in.  The bad side is that the story jumps right in with an assumption that you already are familiar with the state of the world you find yourself in when you start the story, and the problem is that there's very little explanation in the beginning of what was going on.  That's fine if this was a second or even a third book in a series - but it's not.  Again as both a positive and a negative there were several events referred to - but were never elaborated.  There were several times when this happened that I wanted to scream \\"TELL ME MORE!\\"  As I reached the last 70 pages of the book it began to feel that Mr. Bacigalupi had intended to tell a much longer and more involved story, but for some reason other changed his mind part way through.  I'm not even sure I'd call the title character one of the main characters of the book.  I'm still not sure if a few of the characters and their plot lines were originally supposed to have played a greater role in the story or if they were just created to be either a distraction or filler.  The other issue I had with the book was the generous usage of Thai words and phrases when there was an English equivalent.  I get that the story was set in Thailand - but if the book is published in English then when an equivalent English word or phrase exists then it should be used instead of a Thai one.  Those negatives aside - it is a very good story and I strongly recommend it.  It is one of those rare books that will leave you disappointed once you get to the end - not because it's a bad story - but because you want more
0670022411|2.0|A Discovery of Witches is an intriguing story that for the first 200 pages is a well-written, suspenseful, page-turner with a very interesting premise. In the second 200 pages the story slowed and I kept waiting for it pick up again, but it didn't. The last 200 pages were tedious, cumbersome, and full of sentimental exposition and extraneous scenes that added no value; culminating, not in a climax and an actual ending, but a set-up for the next book.  Shame on You Deborah Harkness, and shame on your editors at Viking. Is book number two going to be another 600 pages with no pay-off for the reader? There are plenty of trilogies where the story wraps up in a satisfying way that leaves the reader waiting anxiously for the sequel. Consider the success of the Harry Potter series where each book is a complete story with a beginning, middle, a climax and an end. You have one chance to earn a loyal reader, and a 600-page book with NO ENDING is not the way to do it.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|Coldplay is the type of band people love to hate. Despite often simplistic and sappy lyrics that likely cause Bob Dylan to lose his lunch, Coldplay has become one of the most popular bands in the world today, headlining festivals and selling out arenas wherever they go. Although their sound has evolved substantially since their 2000 debut record, \\"Parachutes,\\" Coldplay has managed to maintain the adoration of their fans with each of their four studio albums preceding \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" while catching the attention of new listeners from almost every generation along the way.<br /><br />With their 2008 album \\"Viva La Vida\\" coming in at number eight on my list of the 200 greatest records of the 2000s, \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" was easily one of my most anticipated new albums of the year. After the first single, \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall,\\" was released in May, that anticipation only grew.<br /><br />Coldplay seemed to be picking up where \\"Viva La Vida\\" left off, offering listeners a diverse instrumentation driven forward by an incessant kick drum. That's not to say \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\" has quite the same rhythmic intensity of \\"Lost,\\" one of the biggest singles to come off of \\"Viva La Vida,\\" but the band clearly took note of their past success.<br /><br />On Sept. 12, Coldplay released their second single off of \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" titled \\"Paradise.\\" \\"Paradise\\" has already earned significant radio play, but any listener who has yet to hear this track is in for a pleasant surprise. \\"Paradise\\" is one of the best songs Coldplay has ever released. Opening with synthesizer and strings, \\"Paradise\\" starts off feeling like a quiet ballad that will eventually become another love song led by Chris Martin's piano and falsetto. However, a deep, powerful electric bass quickly cuts through the mix and opens the flood gates to a sea of strings, drums, and piano. The instrumentation fluctuates somewhat from verse to verse which takes the attention away from the relatively repetitive lyrics, but as a whole the track is fun, memorable, and will be a staple of every concert Coldplay performs for the rest of their careers.<br /><br />With two powerful singles already on the radio waves, \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" has a lot of expectation to live up to. \\"Viva La Vida\\" was the first Coldplay album to truly grasp the concept of a complete album, offering a brilliant balance from track to track without a single song that could be considered \\"filler,\\" but to keep that up for another album is a true challenge for a band typically known for their singles.<br /><br />\\"Mylo Xyloto\\" opens with a 43-second instrumental title track led by a xylophone which sets the cheerful tone of the album. This instrumental flows right into \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" which feels a bit more electronic than any of Coldplay's albums of the past; reminiscent of the changes between Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service. Produced, once again, by Brian Eno, the electronic and acoustic textures blend together effortlessly.<br /><br />The result is as colorful as the album cover and a welcome change from the often somber mood of Coldplay's earlier efforts.<br /><br />\\"Paradise\\" and \\"Charlie Brown\\" keep the energy high bombarding the ears with three incredibly enjoyable tracks in a row. However, \\"Us Against the World\\" drops the tempo down for an acoustic ballad; providing listeners with some welcome variation while still managing to maintain the feeling of happiness and hope.<br /><br />\\"M.M.I.X.\\" is the second of three instrumental transitions on \\"Mylo Xyloto;\\" bridging the differences between \\"Us Against the World\\" and \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.\\" These transitions, first used on \\"Viva La Vida,\\" allow Coldplay to build anticipation for some of the most grandiose moments on the album while keeping them radio friendly. Coldplay knows how to formulate a hit and \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is full of them. As the drums bring \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\" to a close, it's clear Coldplay set out to make the most crowd pleasing album they could.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" has its weak points and they all fall after \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.\\" \\"U.F.O.,\\" another mellowed out song, finds Chris Martin reflecting on his life with a beautiful balance of acoustic guitar and strings in the background. Although this sounds like a winning formula for Coldplay, the end result seems to drag on and the track is ultimately forgettable. The following track, \\"Princess of China\\" features a guest appearance by Rihanna which almost guarantees its status as a single down the road, but it will prove to be an extreme low point on Coldplay's inevitable greatest hits album someday. \\"Princess of China\\" is not a bad song; it's just not Coldplay with Rihanna taking the lead.<br /><br />\\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is a logical next step for Coldplay following \\"Viva La Vida.\\" Packed with hits, it comes out of the gate running, utilizing the sounds that worked best in 2008. However, it does eventually lose steam. \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" has more single strength than any record they have ever released, but its lack of consistency in the second half prevents it from dethroning \\"Viva La Vida\\" as their greatest achievement. This is another must own record for any fan so buy it with confidence.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Snow Patrol, Travis<br />Track Suggestion: \\"Paradise\\"they all fall after \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.\\" \\"U.F.O.,\\" another mellowed out song, finds Chris Martin reflecting on his life with a beautiful balance of acoustic guitar and strings in the background.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|A very high quality bag for your DSLR, lenses and accessories. I use a Crumpler Five Million Dollar Home bag for my day to day shooting - A DSLR body and a couple of lenses and accessories. But there are many times when I want to carry much more than that - 3 or 4 lenses, a battery grip, a reflector, a speedlight, cords, extra memory cards - and carry all this gear safely and comfortably.  This bag is compact, with great ergonomics but cavernous in capacity. I had no problem fitting my Nikon D300S, battery grip and 35, 50, 70-300 lenses and a SB-700 speedlight. The pockets easily hold a folded reflector, ND filters, memory cards, lens caps, straps, etc. The Velcro dividers allowed easy customization of the main compartment for snug and safe storage of each piece of equipment.    The padded shoulder and waist straps give a very comfortable and secure carry with 15-20 pounds of gear.   This bag lacks some higher end features like a rain cover or more flexible outside storage of a tripod or attach point for other bags and pouches. But considering the price and utility of this bag, that's an acceptable compromise.  Highly recommended!

B005K8QIS0|4.0|\\"Case Histories\\" is based on the novels of Kate Atkinson featuring Scottish private detective Jackson Brodie (Jason Isaacs), former soldier, formerly of the Edinburgh police force. Jackson Brodie is a brooding fellow, haunted by the death of his sister Eve when they were children, divorced, but close to his 8-year-old daughter Marlee (Millie Innes). Marlee is the bright light in this series in contrast to the cloudy Scottish skies and neurotic characters. She's bright and forthright, played by one of the most appealing child actors I've seen. Jackson is served and harassed by his critical, blunt-talking secretary Deborah (Zawe Ashton). He often turns to his former partner on the police force, DC Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbington), for help with his cases. She begrudgingly complies, as she genuinely respects Jackson but has a limited tolerance for his emotional baggage.<br /><br />This series is entertaining, and it's nice for American audiences to see a detective show based in Scotland rather than England. Each episode is two hours long and contains multiple mysteries, though the author tends to strain credibility by often having the disparate mysteries turn out to be somehow intertwined. My one criticism in the character writing is that Jackson Brodie is so neurotic that he's goofy. He is always tying himself up in knots about the distant past or some emotional upheaval. Good grief. The flashbacks to the death of Jackson's sister are repetitive and annoying. Really, people get past these things. It's no surprise that the less neurotic characters -daughter Marlee, DC Munroe, secretary Deborah- beg to be seen more. Jackson does have a biting, sardonic sense of humor when he dares show it, though.<br /><br />The three films are based on the novels \\"Case Histories\\", \\"One Good Turn\\", and \\"When Will There Be Good News?\\", in that order. They are simply called episodes 1, 2, and 3, however. The weakest and least plausible is episode 2. These are the films:<br /><br />Episode 1 introduces us to ex-police officer, now private investigator Jackson Brodie, who became a crime fighter on account of the death of his sister when he was a boy. While searching for the cat of his crotchety client Binky Rain (Sylvia Simms), he stumbles across the mystery of a little girl who disappeared from the house next door 30 years ago. The girl's sisters, Julia (Natasha Little) and Amelia Land (Fenella Woolgar) have found their sister's stuffed animal when going through their deceased father's things. They think Brodie is the man to find out what happened. A distraught Mr. Theo Wyre (Phil Davis) barges into Brodie's office to beg him to look into the murder of his daughter Laura (Rose Leslie), as he doesn't have confidence in the police investigation. And a manipulative Shirley Manning (Shauna MacDonald) wants him to find her niece who was put into foster care years ago.<br /><br />Episode 2 finds Brodie out for a jog, when he discovers the body of a young woman floating in the water. Looking for clues to her identity, he traces her to a maid service where the staff are afraid to speak to him. In the meantime, he has witnessed a man viciously beaten in an apparent mugging. A bystander, mystery writer Martin Canning (Adam Godley), saves the day by tossing his laptop at the assailant. But he fears retaliation and insists on hiring Brodie to protect him. Gloria Hatter's (Marion Bailey) husband has just had a heart attack while in the company of his dominatrix Tatiana (Orla O'Rourke). As he lay unconscious in a hospital bed, Marion discovers that their company Hatter Homes is under investigation, and an employee, Terence Smith (Brian McCardie) might be up to no good. Coincidentally, the three storylines turn out to be one.<br /><br />Episode 3 begins while Brodie is working on an adultery case. Gary Moore (Neil McInven), a nervous and possessive husband, has hired the detective to follow his wife Michelle (Morven Christie). Walking home from the job, Brodie tries to pull an elderly woman out of a car that is in the path of a speeding train, but he is struck himself. Revived by a young woman named Reggie Teague (Gwyneth Keyworh), Brodie limps out of the hospital to find that Moore won't stop pestering his secretary for news of the case, his wallet and phone have been stolen and replaced with Andrew Jones' ID, and Reggie thinks Brodie owes her a favor: Dr. Joanna Hunter (Neve McIntosh), for whom Reggie worked as a nanny, has gone missing with her baby. Husband Neil (Tom Goodman-Hill) claims that she is visiting relatives, but Reggie knows that she has none.the path of a speeding train, but he is struck himself.

B005N7CA3A|4.0|First I want to say I'm a big fan of Darren and from day one. I loved all his albums with Savage Garden and all his solo albums as well but it doesn't mean that I'm neither deaf nor blind.  This album is good alright but he has done so much better in the past that I'm left a little disappointed, I must admit.   For starters, the first single Talk Talk Talk must be the weakest first single ever of his carreer. Every time he released a new album in the past, the first single had always been a milestone wether it was with Savage Garden and even after that as a solo artist (he produced wonderful and unforgettable 1st singles : remember I knew I loved you, Insatiable, Pop!ular) and though Talk Talk Talk might be nice, when you compare it to those previous singles, it's just average.   Then the design of the cover is a little bit over the top : it reminds me bad memories of Michael Jackson's Dangerous. Why always try to complicate things and not make them simple. Especially when there are wonderful pictures of him inside the booklet where he's wearing just a plain white T-shirt on and where he's lovely.  Not everything is that bad though, like always with Darren Hayes there are wonderful tracks here too like Nearly Love, Black Out The Sun, Hurt, God Walking Into The Room, Cruel Cruel World etc but the first 2 tracks of the album are pretty weak.  Thank God for the bonus tracks on the 2nd CD because some of them are really worth the extra bucks you have to pay for them : Perfect and Nothing should have been on the original track listing of the first CD because they are so much better than Don't Give Up, Bloodstained Heart or Roses.  Stupid Mistake is without a doubt the best song here, this should have been the first single : a superb song with a great chorus backed with powerful and inventive drums like in the good old days !  So my advice is this one : buy this album of course (even if it's not his best, it's so much better than anything you could hear these days) but ifyou don't have his previous albums, start with those because his first album Spin is a lot of fun and contains great tunes, his 3rd album This Delicate Thing We've Made contains songs like Who Would Have Thought or Step Into The Light with great music that will bring shivers down your spine and of course his 2nd album : the hauntingly beautiful and dark The tension and the spark is definitely his best album ever. I'm afraid that now that he's happily married I seriously doubt he will ever make a better album than this one. It's strange to say this but I prefered him as a singer when he was alone, miserable and desperate.  This brand new album contains good pop music and the lyrics are like always with him, deep and meaningful but to be blown away by some music that will take my breath away, I'll guess I'll just have to wait another 3 or 4 years for his 5th solo album .
0385535139|2.0|I listened to the Audible.com version, thus my comments relate to both the plot (such that it was) and the reader.<br /><br />Please let me rant: Until the big courtroom scene, I do not believe the words of this book were written by JG. I believe it was either a student's effort at mimicry or a formulaic software program where names and scenes were tossed and spit out as a story. The story was weak and no anticipation was built into it. When David first happens into Finley & Figg, there was so much complaint about his former boss, I expected the boss to be found dead and David accused. That would have been a much better story. This mess was like a big soup pot wherein alcoholism, sexism, ageism, fat-ism, and stupid-ism were all put together to create a reason to have a trial. The trial, as expected, was an exercise in futility, but it served the purpose of trotting out beautiful, intelligent women for big corporate (read: bad guys) to ogle and demean.<br /><br />The saving grace, in the last 40 minutes of 11 hours was another fiasco. While it is all very sweet to hope for the kind of CEO we learn of at the end, it is unlikely and the results were too swift and also unlikely -- the corporation \\"caved\\" under so little pressure.<br /><br />As for the reader: He often sounded like Christopher Walken. It was the wrong voice for this book. Not one of Grisham's previous recorded books ever sounded like this. I do not know if an author gets to prep the reader or even review the reading but this guy mispronounced words -- specifically Chicago words. He pronounced LaSalle Street as Lasall, and the town of Des Plaines as deplanes. While that's not a huge deal, it contributed to my dislike for the book. The fact that it was in Chicago was a little disconcerting, since I love the Mississippi novels so much, but as I live here, it's fun to listen for landmarks and references. Those that were accurately named (not renamed as fictional) were obviously gleaned from some reference book and had not the ring of any authenticity. That may all be the fault of the reader's lack of preparation, but it mattered in the listening.<br /><br />Strange and inexplicable: There is a dog in the office who gets fed, but never taken OUT? There was no scene that I can recall that mentioned AC (Ambulance Chaser) getting out to do his business. A small thing, I know, but goes to making me think JG didn't touch this text.<br /><br />When David is at the BIG TRIAL, he has reams of information about a variety of other products manufactured by the defendant. We heard nothing about David's research. Where did it come from? When did he do this? While he was walking his infant on the hourly shifts he shared with his wife? Come on!<br /><br />The tying up of loose ends was fast and stupid. Finley and Figg were losers to massive degrees, but their savior, David comes in with a safety for all. When he walked in, he had money saved from his old job and he spread it around freely. Why? He didn't believe in those two yokels, not in the firm, not in the big case. We knew he was spontaneous and crazy when we met him, but this behavior is not sensible from within the context of the book. At the end, the savior comes through again, and the two hapless idiots get to skate on in their stupid lives. David is so \\"good\\" that his one dubious move, which could have caused him some bad press and bad luck, also evaporated.<br /><br />The bar scenes at Abner's were the only times the book felt \\"real.\\" They were so good that I thought I was reading a Lescroat/Dismas Hardy book.<br /><br />Overall, I am shocked by the poor quality of the story, the writing and the reader. I am glad it was offered at below regular price, so I didn't use an Audible credit for it. Still, at $17, it was expensive.<br /><br />If JG really wrote this, I must extrapolate the following:<br />1. He is subliminally poking fun at: poor people, fat people, drunks and \\"hot\\" women.<br /><br />2. He may overtly poke big corporate greediness and unscrupulous manufacturers, but his real targets seem to be the poor and uneducated. It took David (corrosion-resistant) Zinc to swoop down on the law firm, the poor immigrants, and the big bad capitalists, and David was not even well versed on the law and its machinations.<br /><br />3. I do not have the text to refer to but at one point toward the end the author refers to a drive for one of the lawyers as a small Asian woman of dubious ethnicity. While the word \\"dubious\\" is appropriately used, it has a negative connotation, as if the uncertainty of her ethnicity is dubious -- not that the specific ethnicity was dubious. Call it nitpicking, but there are several of these plays on words that make question author's true feelings about some people. He maligned the clients of Finley & Figg for taking the bait on Krayoxx making them seem stupid, obese-lazy and oh, stupid. They got their come-uppance in the Krayoxx trial. But the Burmese clients, with their gentle and self-effacing ways, well, they do better. They had the benevolent CEO.<br /><br />4. It was a silly book. It had elements of Carl Hiaasen and elements of top-rate Grisham. It had some Jonathan Kellerman (but not enough) and it had some Dismas Hardy. David's capacity for saving the firm and its deserving clients had a dose of Jack Reacher (of the intellectual variety); that is, his efforts were superhuman, a tad ridiculous and somewhat unsupported by reality.<br /><br />So, why did I take so much time writing this? Shrug.. I expected more and got less. I am complaining. I am complaining about what I perceive is a laziness a carelessness by well-loved authors. Maybe they are contracted to put out work on a timetable. This one felt like an obligation rather than an enjoyable undertaking by one of my favorite authors. I regret that I have to wait for the next one to come out. I will wait for the reviews to hit before I invest money or anticipation in acquiring it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.ducated.

So many characters and interweaving plot lines, you can never properly absorb them the first time around. The writing was enchanting and I found myself looking forward to listening to this book on my way to work.

1451648537|5.0|This is the first major book on Jobs and it won't be the last. What it does is lay the groundwork for future books and likely a movie or two. Reading this gives one an insight into the basic mind and personality of a brilliant and bizarre person. It is a big book!  Some critics complain that it doesn't get into one aspect of his life or another, certain decisions, etc. That's ok. Other books will focus on smaller segments of his personal and corporate life. We will be better prepared for them after reading this one.   Jobs, whether he had a narcistic disorder as author Isaacson suggests, or was psychopathic as many CEOs are, was able to position himself and Apple as icons of our time. Reading about how that happened in very interesting and makes for a compelling book.   Don't be afraid that it is too technical. I think most people who may not fully understand a product or its technology will still be able to get the idea of its importance in the scheme of the story.  Institutions built around a compelling and strong person are often called a cult of personality. These institutions usually fail soon after the personality dies. Jobs, though, set up Apple to carry on. He not only left a chain of command, but set up a school to instruct employees on the Apple culture. This was to keep Apple turning out products that he felt were important for reasons more than profit alone and if well done, would be profitable anyway.  The true genius of Jobs actually then can only be assessed in the future and this man will be part of us for a very long time indeed.   I gave this five stars because while the book could have been different to satisfy a more narrow audience,  it is successful in showing who this man was and that is not an easy task.
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Lessee....how many versions of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" do I own? I got it on vinyl, and I now have *5* different CD versions of it too! The original, *unremastered* CD version from the dark ages of the compact disc (back when they released them in those annoying cardboard longboxes), then there's the 20th Anniversary edition that came in that cool little slipbox, the regular 20th Anniversary edition with the computerized album cover, the 30th anniversary edition with the multi-colored cover, and now, I've just forked over some more bucks for this, the 2CD \\"Experience\\" edition of \\"Dark Side\\"! I think it's safe to say that I am now officially \\"Dark Sided\\" out, because \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" ain't ever gonna get better than this fabulous \\"Experience\\" version! (And no, I'm not going for the \\"Immersion\\" box set---too darn expensive for my budget).<br /><br />First, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" itself---we all know how brilliant the album is, so there's no need for me to review it. The sound quality, as expected, is superb. Dunno how much better it is than the 30th anniversary edition, but, listening to it on my IPod Classic, be rest assured that the album sounds fantastic, as it should. And look....the *original album cover* has been restored! No computerized or multi-colored variation! THIS is the definitive, gorgeous black \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" album cover as Storm Thorgeson originally designed it. And I'm GLAD. :-)<br /><br />And finally, there's Disc 2....the long sought-after, live-in-concert performance of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" in it's entirety, performed by Pink Floyd---with Roger Waters included!---in 1974 at the Empire Pool in Wembley, at the peak of Pink Floyd's popularity. This is a *magnificent* performance of \\"Dark Side\\". Listening to the band really work this classic album live, stretch it out, color it....it's just amazing to hear (the highlight for me is \\"Any Colour You Like\\"---the Floyd jam on it for 8 glorious minutes, and it is mindblowing! But the whole performance of the album is brilliant). That this priceless gem of a Pink Floyd concert sat in the back of Pink Floyd's vaults, neglected and collecting dust for *37 years* is astonishing. Maybe they just plain forgot about it. But thank God the Floyd *finally* pulled this baby out of the closet for us, the fans, to enjoy at long last. Better late than never. Thank you, Pink Floyd!<br /><br />So yes, my fellow Floyd fans, by all means, reach into your wallets and buy yourselves the ultimate version of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". With fabulous sound, the original album cover restored (nice CD booklet too!), and a fabulous, classic live concert performance of \\"Dark Side\\" from 1974 tossed into the mix, it doesn't get any better than this.ormance of the album is brilliant).

B00127RAJY|5.0|GREAT starter video to the rest of her DVD's.  I reccomend starting with this one and then moving on to the others.  The others are non-stop 40 minutes and a little tough for beginners.  However, I do 2 levels of this which gives you a short break in between levels as it loads the second workout.  HIGHLY RECCORMEND!
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Everyone gets so caught up comparing numbers on a chart instead of actually using the systems.  I built my system using a 8120 and am very happy with it.  It performs as well as my buddies Intel rig that cost him twice the price.  He can point to a graph and show me his system wins, I point to my wallet and say I am the winner.  I hope we never go back to the days when Intel is the only choice.  Intel is a better company because of AMD and we (the consumer) are much better off.  I hope AMD builds better processors in the future but even if they do I don't have the buck$ to drop an a $1000 chip.  The 8120 is well worth the performance you get for the dollars and I for one will continue to support AMD whenever possible.

1439192812|2.0|The Magic of Reality: How We Know What is Really True is a book by prolific science writer and atheist author Richard Dawkins - here in collaboration with illustrator Dave McKean. Almost 300 pages long it ponders 12 questions which, we are to understand, believers of myth have fought over ages past, but that we, by the means of science today, can come to know what is 'really true' in regards to reality (in Dawkins' view, because its the best possible answer). It is presented as a book for 'all ages' by the publisher, i.e. also for children, and this is not surprising considering that it is something that Dawkins previously has expressed that he has very much wanted to do. I therefore had the 'for children' as well as Dawkins' idea of mediating (popularizing) science in mind as well, as I was reading the book.  As mentioned there are 12 questions. Dawkins begins with perhaps the most daring one \\"What is reality?\\". However it is the only chapter in the book that include in the headline two questions; a follow up question \\"what is magic?\\", and for a good reason, as the reader will quickly understand. The chapter and so the question(s) are introductory and an attempt to set up, in a clever way, the overarching duality which unfortunately plagues the rest of the book, i.e. between myth and science. In this first chapter Dawkins begins with the \\"reality\\" perspective before he has a go on the \\"myth\\" perspective. In the rest of the chapters throughout the book this is reversed.   A slight exception to this is question #9 Are We Alone?, where Dawkins finds himself having to argue against science-FICTION or conspiracy theory, which is different than myth or tales that have a background in religion or folktale, because science-fiction usually begins from the perspective of science.   It also happens to be the least interesting chapter - and perhaps for this reason - that when Dawkins and McKean are the most interesting, is when religious mythology is presented in all its \\"colorful and interesting\\" (p.32) shape and sizes. For example, the most interesting chapter was #6 What is the Sun?.   Here very interesting tales and colorful illustrations power Dawkins' storytelling in the myth-part of the chapter - but in such a degree - that it stands in contrast to the \\"reality-part\\" which follows it. In other words, I was less intrigued by \\"that reality\\", which is the one that Dawkins favors. Dawkins gives credit to the imagination of myth in Magic of Reality, but not without having to reversely criticizing it when he is to characterize that type of imagination, which he believes reality can conjure up for us; it is so much more \\"magical\\" than that of myth. Though as you are looking over the illustrations of the myth-parts of each of the chapters, and then the reality-parts, you are left questioning that, as the most thought-provoking, strictly beautiful and narratively interesting ones of McKean's belong in the myth-parts of the chapters. The reality-parts of the book are filled with illustrations which are typically of a didactic nature. McKean in other words is more constrained here by what Dawkins is trying to say, i.e. when Dawkins guides the reader through a thought-experiment for example. But there are also funny ones, like the caricature of Dawkins and others. But all of this is not on par with the illustrations that power religious mythology. Thus, it struck me that imagination - without consideration of allegiance - is the better choice all in all and even more so for young children.    A final question is whether Dawkins succeed in answering the questions he poses, whether he explains this sufficiently - in other words the mediation of science. First I will turn to the questions he has selected however of which I have mentioned a few. They are interesting questions, but some could be left out, such as the earthquake question and the 'what is a miracle'. I say these last two questions, because they didn't strike me as a question my children would ask, and second the miracle question seemed superfluous and could be taken on in the first question, if they wanted. Furthermore, giving place to Hume, as Dawkins does in this final question, is problematic. Not that Hume doesn't give a sufficient answer, but that Dawkins introduces a philosopher into what is supposed to be about natural science. Perhaps he finds it fitting to end it with a philosopher, but why not also introduce one in other chapters, for example in chapter 2: Who was the first person? I'll be willing to bet that Peter Singer would have a great deal to offer Dawkins. In that chapter Dawkins ponders who was the first person, which inevitably leads him to the question \\"what a person is\\". In Dawkins' mind 'person' is understood in terms of biology always. Thus when he is to build up his case, and we must remember the duality that is set up in the book here again, he first talks about myth (Judeo-Christian) and the first man, and so the first person - and in order to - shoot this idea down, he in the reality-part begins to talk about species, which consequently means we can't really talk about a first person. In other words in order for this dualism, where myth of religion or folktale is the antagonist and science the protagonist, in order for that to work, Dawkins read myth in terms of biology always. That makes myth and science depend upon each other even though Dawkins' intention is otherwise.   To conclude.. Dawkins repeats, for his book for all ages, a children's book, a protagonist/antagonist worldview over and over again, that in this book sets up a not very helpful hierarchy of the imagination. His collaborator, the illustrator McKean, (unintentionally) work against him and this hierarchy by providing the reader with the most colorful and interesting illustrations for that part of the book which concerns the mythic, narrative, storytelling and history. Those of McKean's that have to do with natural science are helpful, but somewhat dreary. Children would find the mythology bits more exciting, I suspect, and that is not what Dawkins had in mind. Second, the dualism which Dawkins continually has in mind throughout the book, eventually boggles the process of the popularization of science as well. Religious mythology has been and can be read in multiple ways. Dawkins has chosen one way out of many, which in this book happens to hinder his message, because the interpretation that Dawkins has chosen, is one where science depends on mythology to explain away why its version of reality is much better. It could have managed so well on its own.
B001V7YJMG|4.0|This movie held my attention and drew me in.  Lead actors are 13 but it's not a kid's movie.  Dialogue is subtle.  Effects are minimal but executed perfectly.  And there's actually an interesting story.

B005QYKE2Y|1.0|In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Awesome movie, great price and here ON release date!!  Who could ask for more!! Thanks for wonderful customer service as always.
1451648537|4.0|I enjoyed the book. I thought I knew a lot about Steve but I clearly didn't.<br /><br />I thought the book was a bit too jumpy in terms of the chronological order. Finally, I felt the book really rushed through the final years including the iPod/App Store/iPhone/iPad/iCloud. I wanted more but it seemed that the book was maybe rushed out after Steve's death.<br /><br />Finally - the final words from Steve are incredible. Needless to say, I appreciate all my Apple products so much more today.

B004YCKJSS|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. The story line is fairly simple but well written which is why it's so easy to relate to. The characters are all people we know doing things we've all done. The cast is outstanding. You will recognize most of the actors although they're all pretty young. Natalie Portman is particularly interesting to watch as her talents are easy to appreciate in this film. I've seen this movie a dozen times and I always enjoy the characters.
0553801473|4.0|Say what you will about Jordan, the guy got his books out almost every year--every 2 years towards the end. I never want to rush an artist in his work, but considering that GRRM spent more than six years on this book (since it was half written at the time that Feast was published), I just didn't get the sense that there was truly six years worth of craftsmanship in this book. He wrote the first three books in the same time it took him to write this one and, without a doubt, the first three books were of superior quality.<br /><br />Without giving away any details, Dance didn't have a satisfying ending. With the exception of the Jon Snow ending, Martin didn't even give us meaningful cliff hangers. It's as if he got up to the 1040 page limit and said \\"that's enough for this book, I have got to save some material so I can say I am 100 pages into Winds of Winter.\\" Sadly, based on some of his interviews and his blog, it seems as if that's exactly what he did. That said, I did enjoy the book and love the series as a whole. I am invested in these characters and look forward to the next installment. Hopefully, I won't have to wait six years for the next book to arrive.
B005IGVYUG|5.0|I am a Waits fan from the beginning. I have all of his work and listen to it often. Bad as Me is right up there with his best.<br />If you like his Lord Buckley/Satchmo/Durante/Carnival Barker/Drunken Cowboy voice, like I do you will love this. Still, with all of the influences he is uniquely T. Waits.<br />Great concise songs full of humor light & dark, pathos and even joy. Ha.<br />The band is incredible. Keith Richards on guitar for God's sake! Love it,<br /><br />  I may be wrong (it's out of focus) but the scene opposite the lyrics to \\"Kiss Me\\" looks<br />just like a house fire in the distance at about three in the morning. Pulled up on many of those.  The mood of this song and the sound go with that scene. My favorite song on the album.<br />  I'm still a romantic, what the hell.  The deluxe edition with the booklet is really done well. Total artistic package. The more I listen to it the better it sounds. Love the sound effects on Hell Broke Luce. He covers a lot of territory of the human condition in a short album.<br /><br />So, \\"Come on up to the House\\". One of the greatest artists of aawwwllll time!
B003K1EYM6|2.0|Apple have limited the port power to 20w instead of 100w.  It means that almost any device u connect will not work and will error with no sufficient power.  So, no external USB mic, No CF card readers, No large USB memory sticks.
B0058FW26C|5.0|Battle LA reminds me of the video Game Frontlines. almost immediately it grabs you by the neck and Doesn't let go till the roll the credits!  Stunning Visual Effects Only serve to add to the suspense. Being a \\"Gamer\\" and a retired videographer the Visual effects were what drew to the Movie in the first place. It seems that there has been an invasion of Earth and the Aliens want the planet. But without the Human inhabitants. It is up to a group of young Marines to stop them and save Earth
0062073486|5.0|the book was in great condition and arrived in a reasonable manner. i was expecting a book that was used or slightly used because in the product info it said it was used, but when it arrived it seemed brand new.:D
030788743X|5.0|First, this book is a serious page turner...I stayed up till 3:30AM the first night I began reading it. I am 49 years old and very very rarely stay up so late to read a book...last time was probably one of the \\"Game of Thrones\\" novels...  Ready Player One is innovative, completely unique in its approach...and probably INVENTS several marketable online products...watch for APPLE or or a big gaming company to make some of this a reality. The characters are interesting, the storyline is compelling, and the writing is superbly done.   A great book and I recommend it. Buy it, read it, and you will be happy you did...
B003UESJHO|4.0|I love this movie and I was glad to get it for a decent deal on Amazon, this is one you must see a couple of times.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|We just got through watching the entire series. Ready to go for another round! Since Scott Bakula is a singer and musician and I wish they were able to incorporate this in the series. Too bad it had to end so soon. I feel that this was the best all around Star Trek crew.  Usually I have a favorite in each Star Trek series, but I think I liked all the regular crew in this series. Though it was only 4 seasons it was a fun series to watch. The last episode was not the greatest because it killed Commander Tucker off, and kind of weak but overall I really liked the series better than the others by far.

B001WCN23W|5.0|Just getting into the stones myself after being fed up with most of the new music out there. After checking out the Beatles and Pink Floyd the next logical place to look was the Rolling Stones. While it is hard to say which album is better from the magical period('68-'72) I think my \\"favorite\\" is sticky fingers. An all-time great album in too many ways to even name! My personal favorite songs are Sway, Dead Flowers, and Moonlight Mile. This album is the opposite of an album like Dark Side of the Moon which is why I think I love it so much. Buy this album now.   Also yes the remastering isn't very good but it was the only copy they had at the store.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love Kindle and the Android app. The Android version has only one drawback: I can't get my magazines on my phone version. I get all my purchased books and my local newspaper, just not my magazine. (In my case, the New Yorker.)  Kindle has Whispersync, a free cellular phone-signal radio that delivers your book purchases and syncs your books to the furthest page read on all your devices--- your Kindle device &amp; your phone, computer, netbook, and tablet devices.  I can't imagine NOT having my Kindle (I originally was a gotta-have-paper Luddite) and the Android app makes it convenient to read wherever I am, even if I left my Kindle at home.  Enjoy it; it's free, but requires your having a Kindle subscription.
B000000W5B|4.0|With a band like the rolling stones pretty much everything has already been said by the fans that were there in that special time and place. Being a new fan I went immediately to the \\"big 4\\" albums. I am still unable to say which of the four is better although I would say Let it Bleed might have taken the top spot if Honky Tonk Woman and Sweet Virginia were included.     On to this album. While Goats Head Soup isn't classic like the four albums it followed, it is still great to hear for the first time like I did last week. Can you hear the music is easily one of my favorite stones songs. I would have to give this album 4 stars if the big four are 5 though. Enjoy it!
B003UESJJC|5.0|Pick this title up. Excellent image, incredible sound, original theatrical aspect ratio, and some of the most interesting special features I've seen in a collectors set in a very long time.
0240815807|5.0|First of all, let me say how impressed I am with the amount of information in this book.   Not only that, I agree with other reviewers- chapters are concise and easy to follow. Over all, I am thrilled that I bought this book, as I think it will get very worn as I dive into the world of home studio recording.  Clearly, I am a \\"Newb\\", so I have a lot to learn.  For the benefit of the other newbs out there considering this book (buy it), this info might prove helpful...  On page \\"ix\\" of the introduction, the author lays out a few key paragraphs: \\"What you will learn from this book\\", What you won't learn from this book\\", and \\"what you need to know already\\".  In a nutshell:  What you will learn: \\"How to achieve release quality mixes on a budget within a typical small studio environment\\"... I believe it. He even provides links that demonstrate before and after demonstrations. Nice.  What you won't learn: The author describes this book as \\"platform neutral\\", so you can use it no matter whether you have Logic, Cubase, Protools, or whatever. Again, nice.  What you need to know already: Sigh. Here is where I personally ran into trouble, because what I really need is a basic primer in the physics of sound... Hertz? Decibels? Sine Waves? Amplitude? Whaaaaaaaa? Studio set-up and session work flow? Hmmm?  Hahaha- Actually, I would love more than a basic primer... I would really love to be able to get my head around these concepts, as I feel this is going to be really important the more involved I get. (Um, yeah. Clearly.)  That said, this book is well written, and to my eyes, seemingly comprehensive, so I could hardly give the book a lower rating based on my lack of knowledge. I only wish I had known a better to primer to start with before, and in addition to,  reading this book, as I am certain that this book would have been my immediate purchase afterwards.  It is also important to mention that the author thoughtfully included some links for  what he calls a \\"whistle stop\\" review. Very helpful, and I am definitely going online and trying to find as much info as I can.  So, I guess what I am saying is that if you are like me, and you are missing these concepts, buy this book, and... another book that covers all these concepts.  Which brings me to my question, as follows:  Does anyone have any recommendations for us Baby Nerds, just out of curiosity?  Again, wholehearted thumbs up on the book! Even though some of it is still over my head, I find it an  accessible and interesting read. Thanks, Mike Senior! I'm a fan!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Hello all  I recently purchased the Captain America:The First Avenger DVD and let me say it did not disappoint. First off i am not going to tell you the story if you want to know that go to wiki or marvel, but to put it plainly the story behind this movie is very good, and has many, many references to the comics both to Captain America, as well as other heroes. Bucky, and the howling commandos are all here and his main foes The Red skull and Arnum Zola are very well acted and brought to life on screen. While i did not like the way Captain America, and Red skull fight ended at the end. I think it was appropriate to set the stage for his return. Tommy Lee Jones does an incredible job as Colonel Philips, and Peggy Carter is brought to life very well by Hayley Atwell. Hugo Weaving's Portrayal of Red Skull is spectacular, but the one who steals the screen is Chris Evans, many including me were concerned he could not go from the playboy of Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movies, to the hero we know in Captain America, i now can say i was wrong and he did incredible. The features on the DVD are kinda slim but i have heard there are more on the Blu-ray edition. The one most will want to see is the Avengers Assemble section which details how the avengers get together and most of the links that brought them together from the previous movies, other than that there is commentary by Joe Johnson, as well as outfitting the hero which discuss how the suit and shield and the costumes were made.   also on the disc are trailers for the sega game, Avengers:Earth Mightiest Heroes tv show, Transformers:DOFM, and Super 8. All and all a great movie and one for anyone but as a Captain America fan for many years, I myself loved it and it really set the stage for the Avengers(just look at the After credits scene) now on to the Avengers  ******* AVENGERS ASSEMBLE FOR MAY 2012***************
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Gods of the Arena is the kick ass begining of the man, the legend, Spartacus. It does a great job at introducing some of the key characters in Blood and Sand.  Definately looking forward to this years series coming in January. Just hope that the new Spartacus, can do the same for the series as Andy did.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Pretty good office suite. It works better for some things, makes others worse. I have been using QuickOffice since I got my phone because it came with my phone. I thought I would try this out since it was the FAOTD.  My main interest was for excel. I have a pretty wicked spreadsheet that I have frozen cells and comments, etc in and it does not display correctly in Quickoffice. I was pretty happy when I found out that just about everything displays correctly. It does have some limits, however. Every time I open the spreadsheet it says there are too many cells and that auto calc is turned off. Also, the frozen cells actually make reading and using the spreadsheet worse on a smart phone because the screen is small. But other than that it has worked great so far for spreadsheets.  Again, I only care about the spreadsheets and have not used it for anything else yet, so look to another review for word, ppt, and pdf info.
B004RE29WW|3.0|The Alien3 blu-ray by itself is almost as bare bones as it gets, although you get two versions of the film (including the expanded workprint, this time with consistently high picture quality, compared to the DVD quadrilogy version), an isolated score (!), and commentary. With two very different versions of the film, you get just a hint of what the behind-the-scenes story must've been like. The story of the making of \\"Alien3\\" is a cautionary classic of many writers and about four directors, detailed in magazines, books like \\"Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made,\\" and the DVD quadrilogy and (more completely) in the BluRay Anthology set extras, but not on this single disc Blu-Ray.<br /><br />But this review is about the film itself, the most sorely under-rated of the main four. Yes, it's dark, with grimy yellows and browns, but it's a very influential look. Yes, everybody dies, but it's all handled very existentially (or at least nihilistically, and, to a point, realistically). And it all basically becomes yet another step in a long, strange journey taken by Ripley and the alien, together again. Yes, most of the characters here are male criminals --some of them major scum-- but you get a whole lot more character and punchy dialogue here than in both of the other sequels combined. Even the \\"F\\" bomb becomes a kind of weird poetry here, not just lazily tossed about like in too many other movies. Eliot Goldenthal's wonderful, sweeping score is almost as good as Goldsmith's score(s) for the first movie. The fx are sometimes obvious CGI, but it doesn't linger, like in the 4th movie; it still serves the character of the alien and his/its role in the story. Alien3 is a logical, and very dramatic, progression to the story. Depressing but beautiful to hear and watch.<br /><br />Deserving of a second watch and re-appraisal by Alien and SF fans.<br />Behind-the-scenes aficionados remember: you'll want the anthology set to get a full story on the making of \\"A3.\\"
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I have to say that this app takes some getting used to. It is probably not for everyone, but it is great for me. I got this just because it was the FAOTD, downloaded it and installed it, looked at it with utter confusion and closed it and went to class.<br />Two days later I was sitting in another teacher's office and we figured out how to use this app.<br />Now I use this app every day. I teach astronomy and the students have observations to do for the moon, etc. I can pull out my phone, start this app and tell them times for sunrise and sunset, moon rise and moon set, moon phases, etc for the next ten days all from one screen. When we covered earthquakes I pulled out this app and told them every major earthquake in the last 12 hours.  I love this app. I am sure I will use it for my physical science classes next semester, too.<br />Once again this app is not for everyone, but if you are teaching an introductory science class that deals with weather, earth science, astronomy, etc., or if you have interest in those things for hobbies, this app is definitely a great one stop resource app for you to have.
B00001OH7P|5.0|You have Rock, you have Pop, you have Psychedelia and then there's Ziggy Stardust. This is a perfect CD. All the notable genres and styles known at that time have been so seemlessly blended, that this doesn't really qualify under the basic term \\"Glam Rock\\". If David Bowie did not record this album, the world of music would have lost something great. That's the whole truth and this is the opinion of a man who does not, at least at this time, consider himself to be a fan of Bowie's music. I can say I thoroughly respect him now. This stands as an essential album and I suppose it has for 40 years and counting...
B003NS1JHY|3.0|\\"Having a black man as a US secret service agent shortly after the civil war wouldn't happen. I don't care how progressive the country was after the war. Not only would most southerners not accept him, but a lot of northerners wouldn't either. When he was in the mansion at the party those people wouldn't have thought twice about killing a black man on the spot, agent or no agent. It would have made more money with all white actors as the agents. The producers thought this movie would make them a lot of profit because of Will Smith's name. It only made 52 million profit. I'm not prejudice. Just facing the facts of the country at this time in history.
B0045DO8LK|5.0|Wish I had a dollar for every time I played this CD.  This is my favorite, the one I played the most.  I was going through a really tough college program in 1998, this music really helped.  They played my home town that year, I loved it.  The music on this album will grow on you, it really is a masterpiece.  Jam on!
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This is such a great movie, suitable for adults and children alike!  If you have not seen it, you must!!
B005LLXB9K|5.0|I really liked this movie.  It took me back to my early 20's and the wilder years for me.  I remember the grunge scene coming of age.  The hair bands suddenly looked really stupid.  The movie recaps a solid 20 year run for a great band.  I have not played the soundtrack yet, all good things in time.  I liked how they gave a soild history to the band, no sugar coated turds here, just the real deal.  Vedder's comments at the Grammys surprised me.  They should have not even gone if it meant nothing to them.  Besides that, it was a great look back a super talented band.

0142419400|5.0|Anna Oliphant expected to spend her senior year in Atlanta with her friends. Her mom and her little brother are in Atlanta. Her car is in Atlanta. Her job and the coworker she's been crushing on for months are in Atlanta.<br /><br />But thanks to her father's delusions of grandeur Anna is no longer in Atlanta.<br /><br />Instead her wannabe-sophisticated-noveau-riche dad has exiled Anna to boarding school. In Paris.<br /><br />And yes, it's the City of Lights and of course that's exciting. Except for being in a completely foreign city, not speaking French, and having no friends.<br /><br />Anna still can't speak French but soon she finds some friends and Paris starts to reveal its secrets--including the funny, charming, gorgeous Etienne St. Clair. Etienne is the perfect friend as Anna adjusts to Paris life. He's probably the perfect guy period. Except for having a serious girlfriend and being completely off limits.<br /><br />As Paris begins to feel more like home, Anna and Etienne have a lot of near-misses and close calls that brings their friendship to the verge of being something more. Even while Etienne is very much still taken. But anything seems possible in the City of Lights. Maybe Anna and Etienne really are meant to be, maybe Anna will even learn some French in Anna and the French Kiss (2010) by Stephanie Perkins.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is Perkins' first novel.*<br /><br />First things first, it has to be said: This book has a silly title. Go ahead, get the giggles out of the way.<br /><br />Despite its deceptively saccharine title, Anna and the French Kiss is a book of quality. Anna is a first rate narrator with her own unique slant on Paris and boarding school. She is likable, funny and ultimately just plain old authentic. While not every has a father who is a quasi-Nicholas-Sparks writer to send them to a Parisian boarding school, everyone will find something essentially real and true about Anna and her numerous adventures (and, yes, misadventures) in Paris.<br /><br />Etienne is a fine foil for Anna throughout the novel with his charm and humor. Though some of the other peripheral characters are less developed, the tension and chemistry between Anna and Etienne more than makes up for it. In addition to being a love story, Perkins packs in a variety of other themes and topics including the interesting idea that the place (or person) someone calls home can change over time.<br /><br />At 372 pages (hardcover) the only real problem with this book is that the last quarter of the novel drags with nail-bitingly frustrating suspense as readers wait for Anna and Etienne to finally realize they are meant to be together. (They both have perfect hair so obviously they are meant to be together.**)<br /><br />With beautiful descriptions of Parisian sights and landscapes, crackling romantic tension, and tons of humor, Anna and the French Read offers a refreshing combination of depth and effervescence all in one delightful story.<br /><br />*Perkins recently published her second novel, Lola and the Boy Next Door, which is a companion to this book. A final companion book, Isla and the Happily Ever After is due out in 2012--I'm really, really excited about that one for reasons that cannot be revealed in this review because they are spoilers.<br /><br />**I say that with complete seriousness. It was one of my favorite motifs in the book. No joke.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: North of Beautiful by Justina Chen, So Much Closer by Susane Colasanti, Prom and Prejudice by Elizabeth Eulberg, King of the Screwups by K. L.

1597801585|5.0|Great book at the intersection of nationalism, corporatism, global warming, and genetic engineering.  First off, I love the location:  Thailand.  Who sets a sci-fi book in Thailand?  Then there are the genetic-engineering bits:  engineered concubines, engineered seeds, engineered apocalyptic diseases and their aftermaths, engineered cats, mastodons again walk the earth.  Then there are the global warming bits:  Bangkok in danger.  Then there are the post-oil energy economy:  mastodons, clockwork-driven machines.  Finally, there's Thailand looking out for itself against the invader.  There are so many ideas in the book, the mind reels upon contemplation.  The book is so well-written, the ideas fit together into a seamless, believable story.  A great read.  Highly recommended.
0792156684|3.0|I was very pleased with how quick the shipping was for this product. The only thing I don't like is this DVD will not play on my Blu-ray player. It works great on a DVD player however. Overall I am happy with my purchase, just slightly disapointed I will have to buy a Blu-ray version.

B005W0ARFQ|4.0|Philip Kerr's eighth Bernie Gunther thriller is set in Prague in 1941.  Heydrich, now in charge over there, summons Bernie to give him security advice.  On arrival Bernie is confronted with a `locked room' murder and the suspects are all rather senior officers.  Bernie has brought his new girlfriend with him but soon realises that Prague is a dangerous place for them both and all is not what it seems.....<br /><br />Any Bernie Gunther book is a joy and this is no exception.  Although the subject matter is far from joyous, a Nazi dictatorship and a turning point for their oppression of the Jews.  But it is this bleak background that makes these books so interesting, how the ordinary Germans had to cope with Nazi Germany, the fear and mistrust and a select few who could do what they liked.  Rich in atmosphere and historical detail, Kerr places his weary and lippy detective close to key events.  This one has more zippy one liners then I remember from previous books and one or two things were a little obvious, but this is remains an excellent thriller.<br /><br />Philip Kerr has been one of my favourite writing discoveries over the past few years.  He does play around with the Gunther timeline (the books are not particularly linear) so you do not need to read them in order.  But read them you should.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I've heard so many people rave about DEXTER that I decided to watch SEASON ONE. I can say that I am already hooked and can't wait to get the next few seasons.<br />Dexter Morgan is a serial killer who happens to work for the Miami Police Dept. as a blood splatter expert. Dexter hides his dark side and just comes off as a bit creepy but still likeable. His sister also happens to work in the homicide division.<br /><br />Here is where the quirky fun of this show begins. In flashbacks, we see that Dexter's father knows his adopted son has the urge to kill and nothing will rid him of that desire. Rather than change Dexter's nature, his father teaches him to be \\"normal\\" in society and to channel his murderous urges for the betterment of mankind. Dexter only kills murderers and avoids any harm to the \\"innocent.\\" Dexter becomes a one man judge and jury as he gathers proof of guilt.<br /><br />Michael C. Hall is absolutely fantastic as DEXTER. His facial expressions tell more of Dexter's inner mind and its workings than any words could. Dexter wants to fit in and be \\"normal\\" but all emotions evade him. He just trudges along every day. Dexter even has a girlfriend who seems to be his perfect match. She is also broken after an abusive marriage. Their relationship avoids the physical and is more about companionship.<br /><br />As the episodes continue, Dexter evolves into more and more of a likeable character despite his criminal urges. He begins playing a cat and mouse game with the elusive ICE TRUCK MURDERER who seems to know everything about Dexter. The two seem like one except that Dexter has some control over his urges.<br /><br />DEXTER is well written and a total different take on the usual police/crime series. The good guy is really a bad guy is still a good guy. The writers have done a remarkable job in keeping this twist in the usual story alive. The Ice Truck killer story is present in every episode and is part of Dexter's journey into his past and how his urge to kill was created.<br /><br />Totally creepy yet fascinating. I can't wait to watch Season Two.ting. I can't wait to watch Season Two.
B00402FGD0|4.0|This item is a companion piece to \\"The Beatles 1962-1966\\" but it is much better value than the former release (Running times: Red Album about an hour; Blue Album about 99 minutes). Everything here can be heard elsewhere so it is not an essential purchase, just another one for the collectors. But the sound is incredible and the remastering team has done a fine job with the more complex recordings on this set. The tri-fold digipack is most attractive. The glossy booklet features an excellent introduction and has some lovely photos as well as all the lyrics to all the songs. It is good to hear \\"A Day In The Life\\" with its \\"clean\\" start. (I think the first time the song was released like this was on the \\"Imagine John Lennon Music From The Motion Picture\\" release in 1988, but the sound is startlingly better on the current release.)  I haven't opened the T-shirt but the complete package is quite delightful.
B005LJITS0|3.0|You need to take this movie as it is a comic book.  Having a Green Lantern flying a spaceship when he really does not need it was inconsistent, seemed out of place at the beginning of the movie.  I found the parts that try to build the story between him and Ferris daughter not needed.  If you into super hero movies it's not bad.
B00402FGCG|4.0|When this album was first released as a double album on vinyl in 1973 it was a real gem - and an essential purchase for Collectors. It wasn't a \\"Greatest Hits\\" type of record, but a collection of The Beatles' finest songs. It contains all the A-Sides of singles up until 1966 and a selection of songs from various albums during the same period. What made it essential was the inclusion of some rare versions of some of the songs. \\"I Feel Fine\\" for instance began with some mysterious whispering and \\"From Me To You\\" omitted the harmonica in its introduction. The version of \\"Paperback Writer\\" was a different mix from previous releases. These, and other intriguing odds and ends made it of great interest to collectors. At the time of its initial release no one seemed to notice that the whole four sides of the set played for just over 60 minutes. (Its companion \\"The Beatles 1967-1970\\" played for a much more generous 99 minutes.) When it came out on CD, it was released as a double CD, a controversial move indeed and many thought that for the first time The Beatles were ripping off their fans. To make matters worse, the CD release contained the usual versions rather than the rarities on the vinyl.  To the present release: I was hoping that the 2009 remastered release would replicate the versions from the vinyl original release, but no such luck. However the sound quality is nothing short of sensational. The remastering team has done such a great job and every song sounds so clear and fresh. It is simply gorgeous listening through headphones. The packaging is wonderful! The tri-fold digipack is very attractive and the two CDs are easily removed. A glossy booklet contains a fantastic essay with a number of beautiful photos throughout and has the lyrics to all the songs.  I cannot give it 5 Stars though, as this release contains nothing new for fans - everything on the 2CD set is available elsewhere. For collectors though, it is a lovely, if expensive, addition to The Beatles Collection.  I've yet to open the T-shirt packaging so I cannot comment on it, but the whole box is beautifully presented.

B0015AARJI|5.0|This is the exact same controller that comes with the PS3. It works great. Amazon seemed to be the cheapest around at the time, and probably still is.<br /><br />I did notice I have to be careful when using the control to navigate on Netflix or Vudu when watching a movie. The L2 and R2 buttons are sensitive and can accidentally get pressed when setting the controller down. In Vudu this fast forwards or rewinds chapters.<br /><br />The controller fits well in my hands. After getting accustomed to it and whatever game I am playing, controlling seems quite fluid.<br /><br />I love the wireless aspect. The PS3 will let you know when the battery low and it is time to switch to a charged controller.
B003Y5H574|2.0|I was told by everyone I know who has seen Crazy Stupid Love that it was really, really good. My husband and I went to see it on a date night, thinking this would be one of the few romantic comedy type movies that we could tolerate, and we were so wrong. There were chunks of the movie that could have been part of a movie I loved, but they were overshadowed by the boring, cheesy, skeevy, superficial parts.<br /><br />Steve Carrel's relationship with Julianne Moore was interesting, they had some great scenes together, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's chemistry was great. However, the rest of the movie (with a few exceptions) was terrible. It felt like three movies spliced into one. It seemed disjointed and way too long. I have never wondered more about the skill-level and decisions of a movie's editor. Several scenes seemed unnecessary to the story and/or were so long that they sucked the life out of scenes that could have been okay. There were also many scenes where I was aware of the actors acting out the scene instead of believing them as characters.<br /><br />The storyline with the kids was contrived and boring and includes a scene at the end that was truly disturbing, although it was presented as something endearing, which makes it even more disturbing. There were scenes that were so bad that I felt uncomfortable even sitting in the theater watching it. The \\"makeover\\" part with Gosling and Carell was way too long and gross. I wanted to walk out, but I felt like I had already invested so much time that I might as well stick it out. It was worth it, the movie did get better. The best scenes are between the \\"makeover\\" part and the very end. I wish that section were its own movie with Emma Stone as the main character. She was a hundred times more interesting than nearly all of the other characters.<br /><br />This movie just made me feel depressed and/or like I had missed something. I don't understand how this two-dimensional, rambly movie is receiving so much acclaim. I guess I was expecting something with more depth, like [[ASIN:B0035G7WP2 He's Just Not That Into You : Widescreen Edition]]. It's still a romantic comedy, but its intelligence transcends the genre. It digs into deeper issues and makes you think, and has characters who are relatable. I think Crazy Stupid Love wanted to do this. I think it was supposed to examine the different facets and complications of our relationships with each other, but in the end it just felt soulless and brainless. Yes there were some really good scenes that I loved (yes, loved), but the bad parts were so bad that I can't help but think of the good parts as anything beside aberrations.something with more depth, like [[ASIN:B0035G7WP2 He's Just Not That Into You : Widescreen Edition]].

0439023521|5.0|After hearing from so many people that I would love The Hunger Games, I was really expecting to be disappointed. As evident from my rating, I was not - Suzanne Collins seems to take from the best parts of the dystopian novels we grew up with (1984, Brave New World, The Giver), the history of gladiator games, the story of Romeo and Juliet, and this country's current obsession with reality TV, and blended them into a gripping and horrifying tale of power, survival, and the many kinds of relationships that develop throughout it all.  I found I could relate to the main character's emotions and motives, and was ecstatic to find Katniss a complete person with thoughts and goals wholly unrelated to finding a man, a rarity for female characters. And though I could see a few things coming, most of the twists caught me completely off-guard and I found my hands shaking as I turned each page.  I read this entire book while waiting for a delayed flight back home, and the story induced gasps and shudders in the bustling terminal, as well as giggles and tears in the crowded airplane, next to a girl who must have thought I was insane. It is by far one of the best books I have read in years, and I can't wait to get my hands on the next one.

B00004W4UB|2.0|Mary Reilly, 1996 film  The story begins with a woman washing the floor; it is dark before morning. A man talks to her. Next the woman is in the kitchen, then making a bed. An eel is butchered for cooking. This is the house of the physician Dr. Jekyll. He was out late to study, and made a discovery. Mary Reilly can read, unusual for a maid servant. We hear about the life of servants. [Why a white suit on Jekyll?] A new assistant, Mr. Edward Hyde, is hired; he is a remarkable young man. Mary Reilly tells about her childhood. The father's drinking turned him into another man. Dr. Jekyll gives her a letter to deliver personally to Mrs. Farraday, who runs a house for sports. Mary has a nightmare about her childhood. There is a dark and spooky atmosphere. [More padding to this movie.] Mary hears screams from a woman at night. \\"Enough excitement for one evening?\\" The butler cautions Mary about her behavior. [This movie moves slowly.]  Mary is sent to Mrs. Farraday, who complains about Edward Hyde (a body in a room). Dr. Jekyll will look into this matter. Mary looks into a book. She meets Edward Hyde. [Note the resemblance?] A hatless Mr. Hyde walks on the streets of London to a butcher shop. A young servant notices the resemblance of Mr. Hyde? A relation to the older man? Dr. Jekyll knows Mary did not break a tea cup. Mary's mother died, she arranges a burial. On the way back she meets Mr. Hyde on the street. Back home the servants are questioned by the police. Did she meet Mr. Danvers? Mary said she didn't meet Mr. Hyde. One morning she is surprised to find Mr. Hyde in the house! Hyde explains the result of Dr. Jekyll's experiments. Dr. Jekyll has a new request for his servant. Later, Mary gets a nasty surprise from Mr. Hyde. There is a fantastic scene in the laboratory, Hyde changes into Dr. Jekyll! Is this the end of Jekyll or Hyde?  There were other movies based on Robert Louis Stevenson's original story in the 1930s and 1940s. There were more dramatic and entertaining than this slow moving drama. Stevenson's story seems to be a parable about the dangers of alcohol, and drink that can turn a good man into a bad man. But alcohol is not the only substance to affect reason and emotion in a human. One reason to watch this adaption from Valerie Martin's book is the recreation of a Victorian household.
B005VGWT2K|3.0|The first 10 minutes of LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD is stunning in its use of the archival visuals, showing the audience how The Beatles came about through a confluence of things including the harsh reality of post-World War II England, the rise of American rock and roll, and the chance meetings of four cocky but talented young lads who wanted to make it big. Once this very impressive intro passes by, LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD dives into conventional bio storytelling that centers largely on George -- and that's where the problems begin. It's not George's fault that he's a bit dull. As he says himself somewhere toward the end of the film from what is probably a 1980s or 1990s interview, he's not a showbiz kind of guy. Far from it, he's a spiritualist living in a mansion who was, by all accounts of those who knew him, a good and kind friend and a great dad. Lovely man, for sure, a bit dire at times, but still a man who really did try to live a decent and meaningful life and strived to help others when he could. He also loved the ukulele. And long, meandering Indian tunes. And he loved planting trees. You see where I am going here? A meaningful and decent life is admirable, but it's also pretty dull as story material for a documentary. At least, in the hands of the esteemed Martin Scorsese, that seems to be the case.
B002KH4KSY|1.0|I'm watching this movie right now, and it is so bad I have to write a commentary.<br /><br />I liked the original version.<br /><br />This one is atrocious.<br /><br />It is the mid 70's and an interracial couple is driving through Nebraska.  Unlikely, yes, and even more unlikely is that the woman is the black one.<br /><br />The woman is loud, mean, and constantly complaining.  Constantly.  The man seems cool headed and has recently returned from a tour in 'Nam.  I hope the woman gets killed but I doubt it.  She really needs to die.  I'm surprised the husband hasn't done it already.  Seriously, she's taking jabs at him about Vietnam, calling him a rapist and child killer and stuff.  Not cool.  Why hasn't he smacked the face off her?  She is begging for it.  C'mon.  Domestic violence laws weren't as crippling back then.<br /><br />The first 35 minutes of this movie was them fighting in the car.  It was just as annoying as watching a couple fight in real life.<br /><br />Oh my god I just saw the man just do a Steven Segal move where he broke a kid's arm bones out.  Oh he just killed a kid.  I guess his frantic wife was right haha.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the point of this movie is, or what the \\"moral\\" is supposed to be.  Religion is bad?  I'll go with that... as long as we include KING's religion.<br /><br />The new Issac is weak.  I can barely understand him.  He mumbles and is too quiet.  And why does Malaci always have blood all over him?  Shouldn't he wash his hands?  I would.  I hate sticky hands!<br /><br />Why can't they just re-do movies with better film and effects?  It always seems like the acting is WORSE.  And the directors always want to change the story to \\"make it their own\\".  Get a life.<br /><br />The man is having Vietnam flashbacks in the corn field now.  He just killed 2 kids.  More flashbacks.  Lots of blonde kids here.  Naturally they are evil.  Nothing more evil than blonde people and Nazis.  Remember WW2?  This movie is really bad.  He just stabbed a 5 year old blonde kid in the juggler.<br /><br />Dinner time at the kid's camp.  Fat girl just slapped someone's hand who was trying to take her plate of corn.  Funny.  Oh now here's the \\"Time of Fertilization\\" aka the underage sex scene.

Glad my daughter wasn't watching this movie with me.  Instead of Fertilization Time, maybe a funeral would be more appropriate?  I mean, 5 or so kids died today.<br /><br />Are these kids Amish?  Only Amish kids dress like that, from what I've seen.  And I grew up in Iowa.<br /><br />Wow they really did kill the wife.  Good.  I expect the guy will die too now.  So now I don't really care about anyone in this movie.  Oh the guy just died.  The end.<br /><br />Oh not the end.  They have an after credits scene.  It isn't worth watching.

B00005JLEU|5.0|If you are trying to decide if you should get this movie or not, go ahead and go for it.  I have seen it, loved it and was not sure if my 6 year old would like it or even understand it since it is not your typical Disney style movie.  I went ahead and got it for her birthday and she loves it.  She won't stop watching it.  Beautiful in presentation this is a movie that kids will love and parents can enjoy with their kids (not in the Shrek kind of way).  I highly recommend it!
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad is a compelling story which shows that you need to have financial literacy in order to survive in this world,especially since it is not taught in school. Also, the book talks about how you need to be aggressive, especially in our rough economy. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who want to learn about personal finance.

1400079276|5.0|Personally, I think this is Murakami's finest work. The plot is complex but never over-written as it goes back and forth between the events of the two main characters. Occasionally I was left wondering by his style of not always explaining what he wants the reader to think but for me, this is part of the huge appeal of his books. If you like this, I also highly recommend his most famous work, \\"[[ASIN:0375704027 Norwegian Wood]]\\". The recent movie of the same name is also worth watching as I felt it stayed true to the book.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|Mylo Xyloto doesn't really have a bad song on it, but if you're looking for another album like \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" or \\"Viva La Vida,\\" you're not going to find it with Mylo Xyloto.<br /><br />Some of the best songs were pre-released: \\"Paradise,\\" \\"ETIAW,\\" and \\"Major Minus.\\" Hands-down the best song on the album is \\"Charlie Brown,\\" but if you think the studio version is great, go to YouTube and search for \\"Coldplay Charlie Brown Jimmy Kimmel\\" from August 3, 2011, and listen to THAT version. Compare the two. There is no comparison -- the studio version is awful. All the live versions are better than the studio version, but that particular live version has the best sound and tempo. A properly produced \\"Charlie Brown\\" on the album would be in the running for the best song of the decade, but as it is I skip over it. Played live, it's absolutely one of Coldplay's best songs ever.<br /><br />Mylo Xyloto is basically a pop music album. Standouts are \\"Hurts Like Heaven,\\" \\"Princess of China,\\" and \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart,\\" but each has a little too much pop and overproduction, and is missing the usual Coldplay magic.<br /><br />I question the synchrony of the songs. There are three instrumentals, the longest lasting 49 seconds, whose only purpose is to lead the listener into the next song, because without the instrumental interlude the flow would have been interrupted. At just under 44 minutes, this is the shortest Coldplay album yet. This is not the Coldplay we know and love.<br /><br />We should expect evolution from our favorite bands -- no one wants the same sound on every album, but I don't believe Coldplay is a pop music band. Mylo Xyloto is a good album and worthy of 4 stars, but it could have been a great album.

The Book (\\"I Shall Wear Midnight) is 0ne 3 \\"Tiffany Aching\\" series.  It will appeal to boys, girls,and adults who enjoy fantasy stories.  I think Mr. Pratchett is the new Mark Twain (but without the acidity of Mark Twain.  I say this because Mark Twain has been my favorite for more than 50 years-and still is my favorite author.  I just can't think of any other author that I would compare him to in these times.  Be careful, because his books are like potato chips, you read one and you're hooked.

0553805371|3.0|I found this considering the difficultly of the subject a much easier book to follow than many other such books. It is also very nicely presented.   His arguments, however, I find unconvincing. We are a long way from understanding many of the issues he discusses. There are heaps of results from experimental studies that we do not have a clue yet. Furthermore, despite what they argue in this book, M-theory (and string theory) is yet to be confirmed, at present we have some wonderful equations but no proof. The extra dimensions are yet to be shown to exist.   In addition, I was concerned by some of the comments such as \\"philosophy is dead\\". Philosophy is also a way of thinking. I am sure as we proceed to explore science, we will find it extremely useful, particularly when we deal with subjects, which there is a lot we do not know.

0439023521|4.0|Some indeterminate time in the near future, North America is shattered by a series of natural and man-made catastrophes, and a bloody civil war.  From the wreckage emerges a totalitarian central government, the Capitol, surrounded by twelve Districts that supply it with goods and raw materials. The Capitol has a monopoly on all advanced technology and military force. Citizens of the Districts live mostly at a subsistence level on whatever scraps remain from their exports to the Capitol, and the merest breath of dissent is crushed without mercy. Another District, the 13th, has already been obliterated for attempting rebellion, and the Capitol employs an assortment of means to reinforce its message that revolt is both futile and fatal.<br /><br />The most demoralizing of all is the Hunger Games. Every year, each District must select two children, one boy and one girl, to participate in a battle to the death that is broadcast across the Capitol's empire. For the bored residents of the Capitol, the event is high entertainment. For the Districts, it's a devastating reminder that no aspect of their life is exempt from Capitol control.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen lives in District 12, a region in what used to be the Appalachians, devoted to coal mining. Her father died in a mine explosion, and her mother suffers from debilitating depression, so 16-year-old Katniss must support her family by poaching game in the forest and trading the meat for the necessities of life. When the annual \\"reaping\\" lottery is held for the Hunger Games, Katniss' 12-year-old sister Prim is chosen. It's a death sentence. Prim isn't capable of surviving combat of any sort, and impoverished District 12 has produced only two victors in the entire history of the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Katniss steps forward to take Prim's place.<br /><br />She's swept into a bizarre ritual of celebrity glamor and gladitorial combat. Katniss is a skilled hunter and a dead shot with bow and arrow, but her opponents are formidable, and she must play to the audience to win sponsorships that can provide a winning edge in the coming fight. She hasn't a clue how to do that. Even worse, her mentor is District 12's only surviving victor, who's known more for his prowess with a wine bottle than his combat skills. Her fellow competitor from District 12 seems friendly enough, and she owes him a favor from long ago. Might his offer of alliance spring from something deeper than shared community, or is he luring her into a trap?<br /><br />Does it even matter? When the Hunger Games begin, the only rule is to survive, and there can be only one victor.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Thanks to my daughter and her high school's English Department, I stumbled onto Suzanne Collins' little dystopian tale, The Hunger Games, and lost the better part of a day to it. I'm not paranoid about my daughter's reading material, assigned or otherwise, but when she begins spending all her spare time locked in her room with a book--one she's due to finish eight weeks from now--I become mildly curious. So, I thumbed through the first few pages...and didn't stop until I'd finished the entire book.<br /><br />It's an absorbing read. The premise isn't all that unusual--stories about societal collapse resulting in brutal totalitarian regimes are a staple of science fiction, and teens fighting teens to the death has been done before, painted in darker brushstrokes by Koushun Takami in Battle Royale. Our contemporary obsession with reality game shows is an obvious influence, and I also noticed echoes of the Greek legend of Theseus and the annual tribute of young Greek men and maidens sent to Crete for sacrifice to the Minotaur, a parallel I was gratified to discover the author acknowledges.<br /><br />Collins keeps the action moving, and the first-person, present-tense narrative makes Katniss' progression personal and compelling-from backwoods Annie Oakley, to fish-out-of-water in the reality-show world of the Games, to desperate warrior. A nice mix of flashbacks and dialogue with other characters fills in her backstory and that of the strange world she inhabits, one that must seem even more dangerous and frightening to young readers who have never experienced oppression, war, or want. The fighting scenes are riveting, as is the depiction of Katniss stalking her opponents through the forest as she is, in turn, stalked by them. Collins throws in a couple of genuine surprises along the way, including a particularly chilling revelation near the climax that I expect sets the stage for the rest of this series. Despite the violence of the Games and its brutalizing intent, I was glad that Katniss, though forced to fight for her life, and indelibly marked by this experience, never surrendered her humanity or her ability to feel compassion, even for her enemies.<br /><br />Some may object to the story's lack of explicit references to ethical/moral principles or spirituality of any sort, but I would counter that it depicts a society which has lost that compass, both in the Capitol (which has succumbed to depravity) and in the Districts (which are consumed by desperation and the task of day-to-day survival). Katniss and her friends, however, provide evidence that the spark of truth and love, and the aspiration to live a noble life despite a world that seems to demand only self-interest, still endure. Katniss gradually comes to understand the true evil of the Capitol regime and begins to see she must somehow stand against it, not simply endure it as a fact of life.<br /><br />I did have a few minor gripes. The supporting cast, with a couple of exceptions, seemed less than three-dimensional, and this impression wasn't helped when several of the most interesting characters met their doom just as we were getting to know them. Katniss' mother is a phantom and her father a fleeting memory. The ultimate villain, the Capitol government, remains shadowy and vaguely malevolent the entire story. We see what it does, but not why, and especially not who is pulling the strings. Katniss' community in District 12 has substance and meaning, but the Capitol and its citizens are an Other of anonymous faces, living in wealth and luxury, blurred into an amorphous, despised entity. I can rationalize this from the story's point-of-view, though-this is how Katniss sees her world.<br /><br />The ending fell a little flat, leaving Katniss to wrestle with a dilemma that seemed trivial by comparison with the battle she'd just survived. Of course, the story isn't really over. It continues in two more volumes, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay.<br /><br />For older teens and up, mostly due to the violent nature of the Games, but even those depictions are more restrained than I expected. No explicit sexuality or profanity.kstory and that of the strange world she inhabits, one that must seem even more dangerous and frightening to young readers who have never experienced oppression, war, or want.

B00169N0BK|1.0|This product has been out for a number of years and several issues apparently have been fixed, e.g. you can have multiple activations, the driver on CD is the same version as the one found at x-rite's website, and the customer phone support was friendly. What has not been fixed unfortunately is the software creating unusable profiles.<br /><br />According to the support technician you are supposed to set your monitor to factory defaults and then just run the ColorMunki software. Unfortunately my monitor is very warm in its default setting and the profile created by ColorMunki resulted in having strong purple shadows. So I started over with a more neutral color temperature, had ColorMunki take an ambient measurement and set a manual target luminance. That results in a profile with excessive contrast and crushed blacks. After a couple more attempts I finally ended up with a profile that was almost as good as the one I had manually created using a combination of HCFR, ColorEyes, and a Spyder2.<br /><br />Moving on to printer profiling I wanted to calibrate a Dell color laser printer. The ColorMunki created a profile which softproofed way lighter than the actual print. There's an option to refine the ColorMunki printer profile for a specific image. Sometimes that option works, other times it just aborts with a generic error message. Either way, the refined profile did not change anything. The generic profile that's provided by the printer manufacturer was a much better match than the custom one created for this printer-paper combination by ColorMunki.<br /><br />After 3 days of fiddling with the settings I gave up and returned the item. Overall it's a great product idea but unfortunately it does not work.
076790592X|2.0|This book was highly recommended to me so I bought it ... looking for some answers to a personal struggle.  I will say that I am fairly disappointed. As some other reviewers indicated, the book could easily have been reduced to about 80 pages and had the same effect for me. I kept hoping that things would improve as I got closer to the end. Unfortunatley that never happened.  Seems like a nice tribute to a loveable old professor but the book was not well written. Many details that would have added to the depth of the book were left out ... and other musings were repeated over and over.  I'm not sure why all the rave about this book. Plenty of others out there that truly make this book look almost silly. Glad it really didn't take me long to finish it, otherwise I'd have been annoyed.

1401307957|5.0|First time I read \\"Everyday matters\\", thought \\"i know it, but I want to learn something useful to start journaling myself everyday\\". It may not sound as a great goal in life, but actually it was my thinking that time. Once I began to read it... I felt a bit ashamed, I am complete, at least in the outside, but life sometimes turns up everything, and you must change or get stuck in pain, hate, self pity, you name it. It requires a strong will to live beyond that ominous adversities, and get the right meaning of all these matters. I should say to Danny Gregory: \\"I am very proud of you,as a fellow human being\\", and to all future readers, well, you will find a reminder of how fragile our comfortable existence is, and how much effort it takes to overcome a personal loss, but overall you'll find a beautiful and true tale of reencounter with yourself and your significant others, in love and courage to find new ways to live a good, exciting and meaningful life. Trough the healing power of love, drawing is a tool of great use to find those ways. After all, an artists search around to see beyond conventions and find new paths to understand the world and themselves. Journaling, drawing, living an illustrated life, that is in few words what \\"Everyday matters\\" is to me. Thanks again Mr. Gregory!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars is an institution of cinema, it's not just a movie (or movies) but is also a cultural<br />phenomenon, a revolutionary franchise, a highlight in Hollywood's history and more. With an<br />excellent entertaining story, endearing characters (at least in the first three), spectacular and<br />revolutionary special effects, epic action sequences and the best score ever, this saga is truly<br />unique and amazing.<br /><br />While the first three films are all classics and modern masterpieces, the prequel trilogy is<br />somewhat of a mixed bag that does not achieve the heights of its predecessors but they are not as<br />bad as many have claimed and they are still enjoyable in its own right.<br /><br />This BD set is one of the most, if not the most anticipated release in the HD format. When it was<br />first announced, many sentiments circulated around the net: joy, anger, anxiousness, etc. Star<br />Wars is such powerful that we, the people have strong reactions towards it. Of course, with a new<br />release, there is also new controversy. First the bad news: the films presented here are new<br />\\"Special Editions\\" that are \\"closer to the vision George Lucas have for his films\\". I really don't<br />mind when directors go back to their previous work and do some changes as long as they give as<br />the option to choose the new version or the original release that everyone likes. George Lucas has<br />never give us such option and that's what bothers me the most. I wouldn't mind the special<br />editions if the original were also included (completely restored of course) and we were given the<br />option to choose. With Star Wars that has never been the case but, as mad as I may be, I have<br />learned to live with the pain and live with the changes that can be very subtle or very obnoxious and<br />stupid.<br /><br />I should warn you that if you absolutely don't tolerate the changes then don't buy this set. If you,<br />like me, have learned to tolerate them or don't care about them then this set is very<br />recommended.<br /><br />I will review each film, their picture and sound quality and some of the changes that have been<br />made.<br /><br />Prequel Trilogy (1999-2005)<br /><br />Ep. I: The Phantom Menace (1999)<br />After Ep VI was released in 1983, the world has lived happily without a new Star Wars film for 16<br />years. But when George Lucas announced that he was going to release a new Star Wars film that<br />was going to be the first of a new trilogy, the world jumped with joy. Ep. I was one of the most<br />anticipated movies ever and the excitement was visible everywhere. When it was finally released,<br />Ep I was not proclaimed as an instant classic like the previous film and many people felt<br />disappointed with what they saw on the screen. To be fair, the first three films were sacred goods<br />and Ep I had to reach impossibly high standards. But, that it's no excuse to deliver a film that was<br />a mixed bag from beginning to end. The picture has a lot of problems, the main one been the actors. I<br />don't know what George saw in Jake Lloyd but he is not a good Anakin Skywalker. He is one of the<br />main detractions of the film, which is bad because he is the main character and if you don't like<br />him, then the whole movie is hard to follow. The other big detraction and this may be the biggest<br />one is the inclusion of the creature Jar Jar Binks. Many people have complained about the Ewoks<br />on Ep VI but the whole group of them are not as annoying as this creature. Jar Jar is such a bad<br />character that comes close to ruining the whole film. Natalie Portman is an amazing actress but here<br />she seems a little out of focus and uncomfortable. The best characters and performances are from<br />Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor as the two jedi knights that save the day. Other problem is that<br />some sequences are too long like the pod race which begins very good but then drags a lot and<br />ultimately becomes boring. The plot is too political and lacks the excitement that the previous films<br />had and overall, you never feel connected to the characters. On the positive side, the visuals are<br />amazing with spectacular special effects, the action sequences are exciting, the lightsaber fights are<br />fun much more dynamic and of course John Williams score is always of great help to all the films.<br /><br />TPM  has a lot of issues but ultimately is still watchable and sometimes, it is genuinely fun.<br />Recommended.<br /><br />Movie: 3 stars.<br /><br />Ep II: Attack of the Clones (2002)<br />After the lukewarm response to Ep. I, Ep. II was supposed to be a return to form for the franchise<br />and while is definitely an improvement over the previous film, it still has some troubles, mainly<br />one which can be summed up in two words: Hayden Christensen. How can you enjoy a movie when you<br />absolutely hate the main character? That's the main problem I have with this film, I can't stand<br />Anakin Skywalker. While the action sequences are better, the battles are bigger and more<br />interesting and is great to see Yoda in action, Anakin is a real pain in the a**. Again, Ewan<br />McGregor is the best character in the movie and you root for him instead of Hayden. But, not<br />everything is Hayden's fault. A lot of blame goes to Lucas who wrote the character as a stupid,<br />stubborn, whiner. Natalie Portman is good but when she is with Hayden, their lack of chemistry is<br />very palpable. The love scenes are very ridiculous and you just can't help but laugh sometimes.<br />What this movie does right, aside from the battles and special effects is that gives us more stellar<br />performances from supporting characters like Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker,<br />Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson and of course there is no more Jar Jar. It's also great to see<br />the jedi order in its splendor, fighting as a strong group. And of course Williams score is as always<br />excellent.<br /><br />Ultimately, AOTC is fun to watch despite its problems and is better than Ep I. Recommended.<br /><br />Movie: 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Ep. III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)<br />Now this is a return to form for the franchise. Ep III, which is easily the best of the prequel trilogy, provides a satisfying conclusion to the saga and I can easily say that is a great film. The story is much darker and the action sequences are great. The battles between Anakin and Obi-<br />Wan and between Yoda and The Emperor are simply amazing. Surprisingly, Anakin is not as<br />annoying as it was on the previous film and he fares better here. For a movie that you know what<br />will happen, Ep. III is a fun ride and almost equal to Ep. VI. Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Movie: 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Original Trilogy (1977-1983)<br />Star Wars (also called-Ep. IV: A New Hope  1977)<br />Countless of things have been said about the original SW so I won't delve to much in it. Suffice to<br />say is that while no movie is perfect, this one comes pretty darn close. It's a classic with<br />unforgettable characters, a great story and special effects that are still spectacular to watch until<br />this day. A masterpiece.<br /><br />Movie: 5 stars<br /><br />Ep. V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)<br />My favorite SW film and one of the best movies ever made, TESB is as perfect as the first film and<br />even better. Darker, with great performances, a wonderful twist and an unforgettable villain, this<br />movie is perfection 100%. Very Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Movie: 5 stars<br /><br />Ep. VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)<br />While this is the weakest film of the OT, is still a great film that gives a great conclusion to a great<br />trilogy. The main problem it seems to be the Ewoks but I don't find them that annoying (again<br />watch Ep I and we'll talk about who is really annoying). Ep VI is lighter than V but is also full of<br />thrills like the triple final battle, one in Endor, the other in outer space and the most important one<br />inside the Death Star. Ep. VI provides a perfect completion for a perfect trilogy. Very Highly<br />Recommended.<br /><br />Movie: 4.75 stars<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Ep I is the worst looking movie in the whole set. Much blame goes to DNR that makes the picture<br />look weird. Faces are sometimes soft, night scenes are sometimes crushed but overall is not a<br />bad transfer. In fact, it has never looked better but it could have looked better if a better effort<br />was given.<br /><br />PQ: 3.5<br /><br />Attack of the clones look much better but still has some problems again with softness and some<br />colors are not well reproduced. But, overall is a godd transfer and I'm sure it will satisfy everyone.<br /><br />PQ: 4<br /><br />Revenge of the Sith is completely demo quality. Is as perfect as anything you will see. A<br />spectacular transfer.<br /><br />PQ: 5<br /><br />The original trilogy looks uniformly excellent. I was surprise that they did not eliminate all the<br />grain in the film like in Ep. I and there is a layer of it throughout the three films. Skin tones are<br />warm, colors are well reproduced and detail and contrast are spectacular. You will marvel at how<br />good the movies look. Some DNR is apparent in some scenes but overall the three movies have<br />stellar transfers. I'm very happy with the results.<br /><br />PQ: 4.5<br /><br />Sound is spectacular in all six films. The 6.1 DTD-HD MA in the whole saga is dynamic, strong,<br />clear and completely amazing. There is no sign of damage or hiss. This is a stellar mix for all the<br />films.<br /><br />AQ: 5<br /><br />Changes:<br />This edition has some new changes in the films:<br />The best one and the only one that feels appropriate is the replacement of puppet Yoda for a CGI<br />one in Ep. I. Is far more pleasing than in the original release.<br /><br />The other changes unfortunately are again done in the OT. Fortunately two of them are not very<br />annoying. The first one is is Ep. IV where Obi-Wan's screams in the desert was changed and<br />enhanced. The other is Ep. VI and now the Ewoks blink. Both changes are hardly noticeable.<br />Unfortunately, the most annoying change, also happens in Ep. VI and now Darth Vader screams<br />\\"Nooo!\\" before throwing the Emperor down the Death Star. This change is very stupid because the<br />original scene was perfect but you know what they say \\"this comes close to George's vision...\\"<br />As for the previous changes, they are still there but now Han and Greedo shoot at the same time.<br />At least now, this is closer to the vision we had of the scene. But for me, the most awful change<br />was the replacement of Sebastian Shaw for Hayden Christensen at the end of Ep. VI and<br />unfortunately he is still there ruining the end of the movie. Thanks a lot George.<br /><br />Bonus Features<br />This set comes with so many bonus material that you will have to see it for days. Everything is<br />great and interesting.<br /><br />First, on discs I to VI, you have two audio commentaries, one from the previous DVD releases and<br />a new one that is a compilation of archival interviews.<br /><br />On disc VII you have the archives for Ep. I-III where you will find interviews, model collections and<br />concept galleries for each film. Most important, you have 22 deleted scenes, 6 for Ep. I, 5 for Ep.<br />II and 11 for Ep. III. This is the highlight of the disc and they should not be missed.<br /><br />On Disc VIII you have the Archives for Ep. IV-VI again with interviews, sculptures, models,<br />concept galleries and 23 amazing deleted scenes, 8 for Ep. IV, 10 for Ep. V and 5 for Ep. VI. They<br />are a must-see for everyone.<br /><br />On Disc 9 you have a variety of documentaries including three making of documentaries for the OT<br />films, a documentary about the changes done in 1997 forthe films re-release, a homage to troop<br />501, a documentary about the SW creatures and a very fun one with all the parodies of SW.<br /><br />The bonus material is excellent and is clear that Lucasfilm put a very strong package.

The only downside are, as always, the changes done to the films and the<br />exclusion of the DVD bonus material. Maybe some day we will see a definitive Star Wars set with<br />the inclusion of the originals but until then, this set comes very highly recommended!!!rall is not a  bad transfer. In fact, it has never looked better but it could have looked better if a better effort  was given.    PQ: 3.5    Attack of the clones look much better but still has some problems again with softness and some  colors are not well reproduced. But, overall is a godd transfer and I'm sure it will satisfy everyone.    PQ: 4    Revenge of the Sith is completely demo quality. Is as perfect as anything you will see. A  spectacular transfer.    PQ: 5    The original trilogy looks uniformly excellent. I was surprise that they did not eliminate all the  grain in the film like in Ep. I and there is a layer of it throughout the three films. Skin tones are  warm, colors are well reproduced and detail and contrast are spectacular. You will marvel at how  good the movies look. Some DNR is apparent in some scenes but overall the three movies have  stellar transfers. I'm very happy with the results.    PQ: 4.5    Sound is spectacular in all six films. The 6.1 DTD-HD MA in the whole saga is dynamic, strong,  clear and completely amazing. There is no sign of damage or hiss. This is a stellar mix for all the  films.    AQ: 5    Changes:  This edition has some new changes in the films:  The best one and the only one that feels appropriate is the replacement of puppet Yoda for a CGI  one in Ep. I. Is far more pleasing than in the original release.    The other changes unfortunately are again done in the OT. Fortunately two of them are not very  annoying. The first one is is Ep. IV where Obi-Wan's screams in the desert was changed and  enhanced. The other is Ep. VI and now the Ewoks blink. Both changes are hardly noticeable.  Unfortunately, the most annoying change, also happens in Ep. VI and now Darth Vader screams  \\"Nooo!\\" before throwing the Emperor down the Death Star. This change is very stupid because the  original scene was perfect but you know what they say \\"this comes close to George's vision...\\"  As for the previous changes, they are still there but now Han and Greedo shoot at the same time.  At least now, this is closer to the vision we had of the scene. But for me, the most awful change  was the replacement of Sebastian Shaw for Hayden Christensen at the end of Ep. VI and  unfortunately he is still there ruining the end of the movie. Thanks a lot George.    Bonus Features  This set comes with so many bonus material that you will have to see it for days. Everything is  great and interesting.    First, on discs I to VI, you have two audio commentaries, one from the previous DVD releases and  a new one that is a compilation of archival interviews.    On disc VII you have the archives for Ep. I-III where you will find interviews, model collections and  concept galleries for each film. Most important, you have 22 deleted scenes, 6 for Ep. I, 5 for Ep.  II and 11 for Ep. III. This is the highlight of the disc and they should not be missed.    On Disc VIII you have the Archives for Ep. IV-VI again with interviews, sculptures, models,  concept galleries and 23 amazing deleted scenes, 8 for Ep. IV, 10 for Ep. V and 5 for Ep. VI. They  are a must-see for everyone.    On Disc 9 you have a variety of documentaries including three making of documentaries for the OT  films, a documentary about the changes done in 1997 for the films re-release, a homage to troop  501, a documentary about the SW creatures and a very fun one with all the parodies of SW.    The bonus material is excellent and is clear that Lucasfilm put a very strong package. The only  downside is that none of the DVDs bonus material has been ported over, including the excellent  'Empire of Dreams' documentary. Still, this new material, particularly the deleted scenes, is  amazing and will be a great treat to everyone.    Closing Thoughts  The Star Wars saga is one of the most legendary pieces of filmmaking ever made. While not all the  films are perfect, overall the 6 films provide top-notch entertainment and deserve to be seen. This  set is almost perfect with spectacular picture quality (most of the time), superb audio and plenty of  excellent bonus material. The only downside are, as always, the changes done to the films and the  exclusion of the DVD bonus material. Maybe some day we will see a definitive Star Wars set with  the inclusion of the originals but until then, this set comes very highly recommended!!!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I absolutely love the writing and the character development.  I love the plot twists and how the books can surprise even readers like myself who have read a LOT of books and see a lot of the same plots over and over again.  So why only 4 stars?  Simple.  This series is like the Turtledove series (another fantastic author) in that they are engaging as all heck but fail to come to any sort of resolution or end.  I like my book series to have some sort of end where the heroes win out or even lose.  The fourth book seemed to just meander along.  As the pages left to read dwindled the realization that few of the plots would be \\"solved\\" grew.  I think this is what it would feel like listening to your grandfather tell a marvelous story only to fall asleep 80% through it and never finishing it!
0439023491|3.0|The book was in ok condition.  There were a few abnormalities, but overall it was in ok condition.  Loved the book!!!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Clocked easy to 4.2 Ghz with room to spare. Never reached over 48c during Prime95.  Although marketed as 3.3 Ghz at stock speed with the Turbo boost it spends most of its time when set to full power upwards of 3.6 to 3.9 Ghz. This is manageable though the Catalyst Control center. I don't know why some of the reviews say it is not faster then the Phenom X6 series. My guess is they did not update their mother board or memory. My MB = MSI 990FXA-GD65  Memory= G-skill 1866 DDR3 With MSI HD 6870 Graphics. I Just updated the MB and Processor on this and i get 15 FPS increase on FFXIV. 10 FPS increase in Witcher 2. Basicly all my games have increased FPS. I was Running a 1100 Phenom 2 X6. To conclude the FX series Processors have huge Overclocking overhead, instruction sets for future programing, and paired with a AM3+ high end MB it is a beast within itself. I recommend to all. Hope this helped any one making that decision to buy or not.
1423140591|5.0|This book was fantastic.  If you are a fan of the Percy Jackson series, you should definitely read this book as well.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|The best horror film ever made!  It is the most sophisticated and nuanced.  It will set your brain cells on fire as well as give you the heebeejeebee's.  The cinematography and script for those who love film is enough to make this a classic.  Its brilliant and a monument to film making.  There is no kitsch to this, its straight film making, straight story telling. The irony in the story has to do with the split between psychology and science as opposed to faith and religion.  This film doesn't try and bridge the gap, it only highlights how those gaps are are feature of contention.  The acting is brilliant.  The mood is brilliant.  It is by far one of the best, if not the best, horror films ever made.
1932100660|5.0|Delivered on time & in perfect condition. The book is an eye opener. Moderation is the key. Control your protien intake (less Animal protien & more Vegetable) and eat fruits & veggies with some starch. It all seems so very simple. Will it work?
0385344325|3.0|Not the best of the Reacher novels. Less gripping than some, and too much egregious killing. On the other hand, for Reacher fans, it's irresistable. When there's another Reacher book, you just have to read it. Not Childs's greatest Reacher book, but still good.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Michael Buble never ceases to amaze! This cd is no exception. I was excited and slightly nervous that this would sound like every other Christmas CD out there, but this one has some classics that he has remade, which was a fun twist. Overall a great CD that I will enjoy for years to come.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|May Contain spoilers... read at your own risk  I did not like the majority of this book. I liked the begining then it went downhill after that. It made me wonder why he had stopped the series after this book. It contained a lot of shadowy characters and didn't mention much of Teresa. He seemed to cram a lot of things in the book without much detail. Think before buying this book.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|I received my regular DVD copy from the Ten Club in the mail and watched it in a car ride the same day, it goes by too fast and leaves you wanting more. You can't go wrong with this movie!
0802473156|5.0|I go to the Bible for everything, but this book HELPED out a lot when it came to my relationship that on some jagged rocks. It allows you to understand, learn, and discover things you have overlooked in regards to yourself and your significant other. I recommend this to teenagers, young adults, and adults alike. Whether you are courting, or are married- even single, this is a must read.<br /><br />It brings you bible verses and examples that break down what God is trying to tell you while you are learning more about you and your significant other's perception on how they receive and give love.<br /><br />MUST HAVE FOR A CHRISTIAN THAT IS COURTING OR MARRIED!!!
1451648537|3.0|To me, the most interesting part was towards the end.  A lot of the other material has been covered time and time again.  For being the \\"official biography,\\" I kept wishing there was more input from Steve, himself.   I also walked away thinking Steve was pretty much a shallow, workaholic, egotistical, controlling, creative genius.  If that's really true, then the author sure nailed it.
B001STDRZC|3.0|This movie was actually better then I was expecting, which was a treat.  A bit too off the wall for me, but had a good, pull together ending.
B00284G2IA|5.0|Really a must have for anyone who loves music and theater. Nightwish is full of great characters who make the most of this ending performance, and they have fantastic musical talent. Tarja is sublime (and her replacement is also, though very different...the constant is the great music) and the blu-ray disc quality is really top notch. As is par for these complicated musical groups, some of the orchestra and background vocals are pre-recorded (Evanesance does the same thing)but it works in the concert very well. I look forward to concert offerings with vocals by Annett. Tarja continues with two great discs of her own so it's a win for all of us!
1846142733|4.0|Ferguson has again produced a thought-provoking and stimulating analysis of global historical development.  His \\"killer aps\\" analogy is an appropriate analogy given our current emphasis and obsession with computerized applications.  It's wonderful to see an academic historian effectively integrate political, historical, and economic analysis into a substantive yet readable narrative.  It's also gratifying to see an academic defend western exceptionalism against the multicultural and cultural relativist mush sadly characteristic of much scholarly political and historical writing.  Ferguson could put more emphasis on the need for a revitalization of Calvinist Protestantism as the \\"killer ap\\" essential to promoting moral, economic, and political progress in subsequent decades as we confront the continuing challenges of Islamist obscurantism and Chinese assertiveness.  I enthusiastically recommend Civilization to anyone interested in global history, economics, and politics.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|Great app, helped me in a bind and worked better than I expected. Great app, svd quick than your normal sheet by sheet scanner!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I saw this movie 3 times on a flight to and from Ireland back to the States. What a charming and delightful movie! I told my wife about it and of course she wanted to see it too. I have been waiting for a release date for this movie because I am certain that we will either purchase it or rent it. Watching this movie on an airplane ride just did not satisfy the kind of feeling that I wanted because I had to watch it on a small screen and listen to the dialogue with tinny sounding earbuds. I want the big screen and clarity of a blu-ray disc and let's not forget the soundtrack! I bet it will sound really good on good speakers.   Overall, Woody Allen has done it again and infused his magic on this gem of a movie. Like fine wine, Woody Allen is getting better with age.
0439023521|5.0|I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this book on a long car ride and was riveted. The premise of the story is somewhat disturbing, but the author eases the reader into it to an extent that it becomes plausible. I empathized with Katniss and Peeta greatly, and enjoyed the cleverness of the arena that was created. The story moves along at a brisk pace and will held my rapt attention.  In the end, it makes me want to read the next book... like, right now.
B000PMG16U|3.0|I don't know who missed the boat over there at the &#34;ranch&#34; but they forgot to add bass to the surround sound format!<br /><br />I wanted to test my subwoofer by unplugging all the other speakers in my surround sound system so I can hear only the low frequency sounds and to me surprise there was very little bass from Episode 1. Even on all of the action sequences I was let down. Shocked would be the word I would use! Episode II was even worse. I was so confused I went back and checked my settings but nothing was wrong on my end. Episode III had no bass at all. I even put my sub at 80% max power. Still - nothing. I tested 2 other movies and bamm - I got the BOOOOOOM!!!<br /><br />This is frakking Star Wars man how the hell did they get this so wrong? Im going to buy the standard def dvd's again. I never had a problem with those...
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This book is the eleventh installment of Lee Child's mystery/suspense series featuring Jack Reacher, an ex-Army MP, who is now a drifter carrying only a passport, an ATM card and a folding toothbrush. The story opens with Reacher's  ATM receipt showing a balance that is exactly $1030 more than it should have been. He calls his bank and is told that there is no mistake and that a deposit was made by personal check from a Chicago bank. This tells him what he needs to know. The $1030 amount is code for a ten-thirty radio message, which translates to an urgent call for assistance, that could only have come from Frances Neagley, a sergeant in his former MP team, who lives in Chicago.  Since Neagley had no way of knowing how to contact Reacher, she was clever enough to send him a message through a deposit to his account.<br /><br />Reacher tracks down Neagley and finds out that she called for help because one of the members of their MP team has been murdered. The others are missing and it looks like the whole team is being targeted. Reacher and Neagley must locate the rest of the team (if they're still alive) and find out who's after them and why.<br /><br />Child keeps the plot moving with multiple clues and plenty of action. Unfortunately, the main problem with this series is that no matter how many times Reacher gets shot at, there's never any doubt that he will survive since you know that he'll be back in the next  book. Other than that, if you're a fan of Jack Reacher, you'll find that this is one of the best.
B004OWPWEO|5.0|This is probably my favorite Springsteen concert.  I had it on vinyl back in 77 and I have a CD made off of the vinyl.    All of the other reviews are correct.  I want to add six things, for anyone who is not familiar with it:  1) Incident is done with solo piano and is spellbinding.  At the end, there is a siren that comes in.  For many years, people believed it was part of the performance because it is so well timed relative to the narrative in the lyrics.  Recently a story emerged that it was just a  coincidence that a police car came by the Main Point at that time. I don't know what the truth is, but listen for it.  2) In Jungleland, the guitar and sax solos are traded (Clarence does the first, fast solo and Bruce does what later became Clarence's signature on guitar).  There are no howls at the end, just a soft violin fade.   3  In She's The One, one stanza of lyrics is what later turns into Backstreets.  4) Wings for Wheels is Thunder Road of course, but the words Thunder Road do not appear in it.  It's these glimpses into the creative process of making the BTR album as much as the covers, that makes this disc so amazing. I wish it could have been cleaned up and released in the BTR anniversary set.  5) E Street Shuffle is done is the slow 15 minute version that was also done at the Bottom Line and several other 75 concerts.  6  Back in the USA is also fantastic, although the sound is compromised.
0307749495|5.0|We love Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels. The Affair did not disappoint us. We listened to it on our recent drive back East. It was great!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|There are very few albums out there where every song is good but this is one of them. This woman has one of the best female voices out there. Even better than her voice though is her music. Her songs pack a lot of power. This is a great addition to any collection.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I have all 600 Stars, can't wait for more levels! Looks and works flawlessly on my sensation 4g. A must have!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|You will obviously love the DVDs. And if you haven't watched it before you should definitely buy this. It's an amazing show. I recently became obsessed with Supernatural:)
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great movie!! I grew up reading the comic books and must say it is very cool to see all heroes of my youth coming to life on the big screen. Marvel has done a wonderful job with the animation and making things move along with the way the stories were told. great job! I would recommend this and all the other Marvel and DC movies!
0470932139|5.0|A great example of a real life relationship between one and the camera. Easy to understand and great photographs to explain the text. This book is great to sharpen up o your photography skills. Well done x
0525422943|5.0|Before getting to Where She Went, I reread If I Stay. After staying up till the wee hours of the morning reading Where She Went, I took a little break. Just thought about it, trying to figure out what to say because that's what Gayle Forman's books do to me. Her stories and characters have a way of lingering in my mind. I went about my day and in the late afternoon I decided to reread majority of Where She Went. Yeah, it was that good. I think I enjoyed it as much, if not more, than If I Stay.  I won't lie, I had some slight edge of anxiety and worry before actually picking this book up and even while I got into it. In a way similar to If I Stay, there was an air of uncertainty--the choice Mia would make to stay or not. As for WSW: whether or not Adam and Mia could reconnect on their one night together. I just kind of wondered if they'd be able to get over the baggage weighing them down. I truly wanted them to heal and move on. Hopefully together, but I'd understand (maybe, sort of, okay not really) if they were way past that point.  This book was angsty and I loved it. Adam let himself go; he was a self-destructive mess, basically a mopey shell of his 18-year-old self. His hurt, his frustration clearly bleeding on the pages. Mia seemed almost the same, at least to me, but with a little more maturity. Both, however, have walls built up and in self-preservation, neither are REALLY talking about the elephant in the room. They have a lot of unfinished business and secrets that need to be revealed and discussed. They'd never get any closure otherwise. I was blown away with how Forman dealt with letting all the words spill out of them. First with the bridge, then the bench, the studio room, and finally on the patio outside. I even teared up and cried during a few of those scenes. The writing is so beautiful and raw, it just took my breath away.  There were other great things about this book as well. I like the flashbacks into Adam's past, both before the car accident andafter. The back drop of New York was wonderful. It makes me wish, even more so, that I lived there so I could explore and find my own urban Easter eggs. And maybe not everyone enjoyed this, but I liked the lyrics from Shooting Star's big Collateral Damage album--the album written by Adam after Mia left him in the dust.  By the end, I got a lovely story and closure about Adam and Mia I'm very content with.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen<br /><br />Recently I went on a drive home to California and back.  It's about 7 1/2 hours each way (because I actually go the speed limit!!!) and I wanted to try something new while driving.  So, I decided to try an audio recording.<br /><br />I found one from my local library of Pride and Prejudice.  :  Why not go with a classic book for the drive home?<br /><br />So, I listened to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is the story of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane.  Both are of marriageable age but do not come from the wealthiest of families.  However, they live in a time when marriage to someone with wealth is of utmost importance.<br /><br />Since they have no brothers, when their father dies his estate will go to another male relative, as they are unable to inherit.<br /><br />One summer a new family comes to live nearby, and Mrs. Bennet, their mother insists that Mr. Bennet make an acquaintance with Mr. Bingley, the new bachelor who is very wealthy.  At a ball one evening he is immediately taken with Jane Bennet who is admittedly beautiful, of a sweet nature, but perhaps below the standard of wealth into which he is expected to marry.<br /><br />But the problem really is his friend, Mr. Darcy.  A haughtier more proud man has never existed, and though that same night at the ball many women did not have partners as men were few, Mr. Darcy makes it clear that he thinks pretty negatively of Elizabeth Bennet.  He is cold, unfriendly, and seemingly unkind . . .<br /><br />Mrs. Bennet is determined to see her daughters married and encourages Jane and Mr. Bingley, but is desperate to make a match for Elizabeth, including pushing her to accept the proposal of marriage from her most insipid cousin.<br /><br />We follow the story of the Bennet family as others do everything they can to keep Jane and Mr. Bingley apart, and Elizabeth is forced into close proximity with the awful Mr. Darcy repeatedly.<br /><br />Will Jane and Elizabeth ever find true love that others will accept?  Or will their less wealthy state be their destruction?<br /><br />Read Pride and Prejudice to find out!<br /><br />This is a total and complete classic.  There are over 2 million copies sold worldwide, hundreds of editions, and quite a few different audio recordings, not to mention TV and movie versions of this story.<br /><br />If you haven't actually read Pride and Prejudice you simply must!  It's a beautiful, wonderful story full of lively characters with personality oozing from them.  Mrs. Bennet is incredibly silly, a trait which seems to have rubbed off thoroughly on several of her daughters.  But Jane and Elizabeth took far more after their father with much more sense.  It's the story of how pride and prejudice can keep you from truly seeing another's character, and how opinions can change when someone is given a true chance.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone!<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars!br /><br />Will Jane and Elizabeth ever find true love that others will accept?

192076920X|5.0|I read this book after I'd gone to India with TellusArt. It's an incredibly spiritual book, which you wouldn't know by the cover text. I would have picked it up sooner had I known. I love the awareness, the insight, as he makes one choice after another, that indeed it is a choice, and it comes with consequences. The tale is riveting, a well told tale, that keeps you reading the whole way through. It's an incredibly thick book but well worth the time it takes to plow through it.  I don't know if everything is true, but who cares, the story fascinates in many many ways. I found answers to many things we'd wondered about during our trip. Mumbai and India is an experience that seeps deep into your soul.
0321701763|5.0|Great instructional book that you can use at your leisure and always go back to it as a reference.  Very easy to follow with step by step instructions.  Hands on!
B005XOPEOU|5.0|So, I wrote a review for this album yesterday & promptly pulled it once I started reading other reviews noting issues with the mix and \\"loudness\\" of the album.  I went back and gave it a listen again via both iPod and Amazon Cloud Player through a decent set of speakers.  The album definitely ranges from full-tilt aural assault mode to very quiet passages and can be a bit jarring if unprepared...and I don't really care!  The content is just too good, and as long as you ease your way into the second cut to feel out the maximum volume, I don't think you'll do any hearing damage.  There are strong U2 influences on several tracks, and I hear M83 in there too...just really good stuff.  If you are a fan of Coldplay's last few albums, I think you'll be selling yourself short by passing this one up because of \\"volume\\" complaints.  As usual, an excellent use of tension & release throughout.  Plenty of Coldplay \\"goosebump\\" moments. :)

B004W2UBYW|1.0|I regret to say that had Steve Jobs and his 'chosen' biographer, Walter Isaacson, followed the lofty advice and naked wisdom dispensed by Steve to Stanford students in the now famous 2005 commencement address, this authorized biography would not be such a colossal disappointment.<br />Isaacson's \\"Steve Jobs\\" is thin on examination, integration, and the connective juice that should unite its numerous disconnected parts and obvious gaps into a credible and fascinating whole.  Instead, we have the Peggy Lee of bios in a 600-plus page tome: Is That All There Is?  Here, we get much regurgitation of hackneyed stories decorated with a stingy smattering of mostly stock photos, some out of focus and grainy as if they had been culled from a newspaper archive before the digital era, or were taken out there in the firmament.  Talk about yet another contradiction and irony in the unfinished Steve Jobs story.<br />How such a larger than life high-tech drama prince could be churned into this snoozer of a bio is suspect and troubling.  Perhaps the best of Steve Jobs biographies is yet to be -- after the will has been read and the high drama vaporized -- when perspective returns.  Meanwhile, this enigmatic, major figure in Silicon Valley has been buried in breathtakingly moribund data in search of a pulse.<br />How many biographies require a key of characters, like a play?  If a bio is engrossing, no key is necessary.  This Steve Jobs needs a key to motor.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|The movie works well. We are happy with this fact.   And contrary to some of the posted reviews we did get the actual 2 disc SPECIAL EDITION.  HOW EVER The photo showed the packaging in English only.  So we ordered it.  We did not know that the packaging would be heavily SPANISH.  There was some english as well.  We were hoping we had not gotten a subtitled version.  As the pictures did not show this fact.  And we had not noticed this in the store released versions.  We were also worried we had gotten a spanish version.  We have never used AMAZON.COM before.  We tried to contact them for reassurance this is english and spanish wrapped in.  There is no contact us phone numbers to talk to anyone on our receipt order form.  There is no contact us for that matter on the site.  I clicked contact and it kept redirecting to another page.  We tried AMAZON because my daughter had gotten a birthday giftcard.  And i am not really pleased with the lack of customer service.  Luckily we have a set of spanish TWI-HARD fans next door.  So we opened it and prayed for the best.  If nothing else we could pass it on to them.  But thank heavens it is english with no subtitling.  But it does have spanish options.  So if you don't mind a copy with spanish stuff all over it.  This is a good one.  But if you don't want all of the spanish stuff.  Buy somewhere else.  As for me i think i will be going back to EBAY.  Because i have paypal guarantees and customer service to talk to if something goes wrong.  I am sooo lucky this turned out ok.
B0055SWM08|5.0|game is way addictive, at the rate I am going I will be done in a few days. definitely need more levels. this is one of the most high quality games I've ever seen. absolutely remarkable. love everything about it, gives you this feeling mmmmmm this game is totally awesome!

B005UKJX4E|5.0|This review is intended for those who are looking at the controversy and wondering whether they will hate the film.  Have you ever listened to a symphony from beginning to end?  Have you ever watched a ballet, contemplated a work of sculpture, memorized a poem or appreciated a painting intellectually and emotionally?  Have you ever enjoyed reading a book?  If you can honestly answer no to all these questions, then The Tree of Life may be a difficult work for you to enjoy.  Watch the trailer.  It's an honest representation of what the film's about and how it tells its story.  The pacing in the movie is much slower, but those are the key elements.  It is highly imagistic.  Many of the episodes are like memories, the memories of the narrator, Jack O'Brien.  The impressions stay with you for many days after viewing, almost as if you were recalling your own memories.  Director Terrence Malick weaves many allusions into this film, both musical and cinematic, but you don't need to grasp them all to enjoy the film.  The one reference that you absolutely should understand is the story of Job from the Bible.  The epigraph at the beginning of the movie quotes from God's reply to Job's lamentation.  The infamous creation sequence that depicts the beginning of the universe, the rise of life on earth, and its evolution, can be understood as a cinematic representation of God's answer to Job.  That's why it's included in the film.  Another key to interpretation also comes from the beginning of the film.  There are two ways in life from which we must choose, we are told, the way of nature and the way of grace.  The film concerns the dramatic conflict between these two forces, nature and grace.  The symbolism is not simplistic.  Both the father, who represents nature, and the mother, who represents grace, are conflicted.  There is also an oedipal conflict which is strongly implied throughout the film but never stated.  All of the dramatic conflict is subtly portrayed, often without the use of words.  After you watch it, you will probably have some questions that have not been explicitly answered by the film.  It is an intellectually demanding film in that regard, but you don't need a degree in philosophy or film studies in order to enjoy it.  If you can put a little thought into it you will be rewarded.
B003L77GRO|5.0|The intensity of the previous season, and the desire to \\"know what happens next\\" motivated me to buy the 5th season of Dexter. I never expected to like this show, but every season it just seems to get better somehow, and it started out good. Season 5 is quite certainly no exception; I have absolutely no regrets about buying this, and will most likely get the next season when it's available as well.
B005HS00V4|3.0|Peter Gabriel's music with no drums, guitars, bass, this is what this Blu-Ray is. It's new arrangements of songs with orchestra and a couple of females vocalists. So those news versions are classical oriented and are definitively more relaxed than the original songs. There is also about four songs taken from others composers. Those songs didn't grab my attention as very interesting songs, as some late Gabriel's songs, like \\"In Your Eyes\\" and \\"Don't Give Up\\". My favorite songs are from my favorite cd, and it's \\"The Rhythm Of The Heat\\" and \\"San Jacinto\\".  The music is more of a background sound to let the beautiful voice of Peter shines. The picture quality is excellent as the DTS-HD sound. I don't know if i can recommend this for all Peter Gabriel's fans. Maybe they will be disappointed with the quiet atmosphere and sound, missing the rock environement. For me, i didn't feel enough brilliant moments to enjoy the performance from start to finish.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen but this book is filled with the same jokes she has on her television show and I have found only a few things that actually made me laugh.  I truly hope she just sticks with her show and doesn't write another book. There's only so many ways to make something funny and I'm sorry to say she has missed the mark.
1932735410|5.0|I recently passed the PMP exam using only RMC materials (Rita's prep book, exam simulator and flashcards) and although the exam was difficult and stressful, I can say with 100% certainty that the RMC materials prepared me to pass. Every PMP at my company used RMC materials--some as far back as 10 years ago--and I don't know anyone at my firm who ever failed the exam. RMC has been doing this a long time, and their products are absolutely worth the premium price.  I found the book to be easy to follow and easy to break down into areas where I needed to concentrate the majority of my study.  There is very little memorization involved.  The book made all of the concepts understandable, and helped me figure out my gaps (where I needed to focus most of my study time).  Overall, it was well written, suited my study plans and helped relieve most of my anxiety about taking the test.  In addition to the book, exam simulator and flashcards, I also ended up using the abridged audio CD version  of the book (6th edition-- 7th wasn't available yet) as I got closer to my exam date. Although the audio version doesn't contain nearly the same amount of content as the paperback, it was a good review tool for me during my commute.    Highly recommend!

0440244412|5.0|As other reviewers have wisely stated, it's difficult to review Shadowfever without spoilers - LOTS of spoilers - because this volume answers nearly all of the questions that accumulate throughout the reading of the previous books in the series. Won't even try. Will instead offer this to prospective readers:<br /><br />If you haven't read the first four books (Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever), do so. One right after the other. Consuming the whole series at once is a staggering experience. This is perhaps the most captivating UF series I've ever read. And re-read. And read again. Ironic, because KMM was hesitant to take a chance on writing the Fever saga. Urban Fantasy. Not really her thing. Oh, yes it is. She takes Mac from the book one smallness of bikinis, perfect tans and tunes-by-the-pool to the book five enormity of endless black wings studded with planets, stars and infinity with such skill, cleverness, sensuality, heart and, yes, humor-in-the-most-unexpected-places that I'm still catching my breath. Her characters, ALL of them, are 3-D and onion-layered with intriguing ambiguities. Even the most noble have dank secrets and the most vile have backstories that make them understandable, if not likeable. All of KMM's creations - human, fae and the jaw-dropping `other' creatures - are rich and authentic to the point of walking, crawling and flying off the pages. And then there are the surprises. Sometimes this author slithers up from behind with her twists, and sometimes she just drops them on the reader's unsuspecting brow like and anvil...ala Darroc's Chapter 13 encounter with K'Vruck. `Nuff said.<br /><br />If Shadowfever was the end of the series, a long period of mourning would be in order. The Black Wing Blues, if you will. Thankfully, KMM's website indicates that, not only are two Dani-based mysteries in the works, but they will be followed by two more Mac/Jericho based books.<br /><br />So that just leaves the questions:<br /><br />How long must we wait for KMM's next offerings?<br /><br />How ever will they cast the inimitable Barrons for the Dreamworks movies based on this series? This unnamed miracle actor will not only have to look the part, but have the skill to convince us he is actually `an animal dressed up in the skin of a man', and be unchanging enough to look the same for the span of, hopefully, several movies. Same goes for the rest of his \\"Eight\\", who literally howl for their own books. Possibly an Anthology of Eight...?<br /><br />And, finally, will the production company actually spring for a Maybach sedan, a lamborghini Countach Wolf, a Porche 911 Turbo, a Viper...? (grins)
B000BVMAJ2|4.0|Bought this to entertain my granddaughter for a very long travel day.  Worked like a charm for a 2yr. old. Great construction , bright colors, and easy to manipulate the pieces for small hands.

B000TCEU4Q|5.0|After purchasing the Saitek yoke, I wanted to be able to fly twins and multi-engine aircraft in FSX with the same realism.  I purchased the extra Pro Throttle Quadrant to add to my system.  Great addition.  Now I have so many options and configurations for the sim.  I don't use the Saitek software with my machine, so the only downside I have is when I change from single prop to multi prop or jets, I have to go into settings and change the controls.  Not a big deal for me, but might be an inconvenience for some.

I tried everything to resurrect it and unfortunately these cables just have a short shelf life. It's not acceptable for a comparatively pricy device. Hopefully, Amazon refunds me. Trying the Belkin now that you can find at the Apple store. Hopefully it lasts longer.

0385535139|4.0|This book presents again some memorable Grisham-style characters like Figg and David Zinc.  About the plot: ne day Figg finds out about a potentially huge lawsuit against a pharmaceutical manufacturer, and he starts signing up other clients.  And again, Grisham's poor lawyers are against a formidable armada of corporate attorneys.  I would recommend this book to the readers who loved to read Grisham's books like Rainman, Client, and the Pelican Files.This book reminds me of those books.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Very pleased with this movie. It came very quickly and the packaging was nice, not damaged at all I would definately buy from this selle again! Thanks for the movie and the well priced deal!
0385535139|4.0|Some of Grisham's recent books (for example, \\"The King of Torts\\") have developed their stories within the context of mass tort litigation.  This phenomenon is most familiar in the guise of massive settlements against pharmaceutical or medical device companies where hundreds or even thousands of individuals claim injuries resulting from a defective medical or pharmaceutical product.  The cases are consolidated or tried in groups by coalitions of plaintiff's lawyers. Settlements may involve hundreds of millions of dollars, and the leading counsel in this field enjoy private jets, large mansions, and lots of bucks.  This novel has Grisham approaching the issue from the opposite perspective from \\"The King of Torts,\\" which focused upon one of the giant products liability litigators and demonstrated how this brand of counsel operates, build coalitions with other plaintiffs' lawyers, and engineers massive settlements, as he moved from one product to another, and one new jet to another. By contrast here, the focus is a small ambulance chaser firm in Chicago, consisting of two long-time feuding partners, augmented by a young Harvard law graduate who has fled from the unhappy role of being an associate in a giant Chicago law firm. These guys who practice \\"street law\\" are about as different from the tort giants and corporate law firms as can be.  We see as the story develops how this small firm gets involved in a giant drug class action, how it goes about recruiting clients (including advertising), how it draws support (including helpful \\"experts\\") from the big boys running the overall case for the thousands of plaintiffs, and how such a case is prepared for trial. We also see how such a case, with potential settlement value of a $2 million a case, can suddenly fall apart, leaving the small firm participants in an extremely vulnerable position, especially if they must try an actual case against the first-class legal teams representing the defendant companies. We also see how asmaller case of lead poisoning can be successfully handled, so that an innocent victim is properly and quickly compensated.  We hear much criticism about \\"personal injury lawyers\\" and how they drive up medical costs and bring unjustified cases to force juicy settlements and fat fees. Grisham's two books on this theme actually educate the reader a good deal about this type of legal practice, how it allows \\"the little guy\\" to fight corportate giants, while not shying away from focusing on the abuses of the present system. Aside from this, while this is not the most gripping of Grisham's books, it is a pretty engrossing (if a bit contrived) tale that lovers of good legal thrillers should enjoy enormously.
0937381888|5.0|Book is full of great information.  This book was recommended to me by a fellow homebrewer that has been doing it for many years and boy was she spot on with this book.  Don't pass this up!
0375703764|5.0|Its wonderfully creative, and deliciously eerie. Its a difficult book to get through, but if you can do it, it is 100% worth it.
0312330537|5.0|Amazing book and this guy's life story is just simply incredible.  I cant emphasize enough how great this book is.
076115678X|5.0|Yes, she's overly cheesy (and throws puns around like Hollywood stars throw dollars) and yes, you can get all the same information for free on naturallycurly.com.  BUT.  For me personally, naturallycurly.com is *overwhelming* in its wealth of information. And the puns/cheese kept things interesting during the scientific bits.  A curly-headed friend of mine loaned me this book and it was exactly what I needed to fall in love with my curls. I've hated my curls since high school because I was picked on unmercilessly (no, REALLY). The curl confessions spoke to me because I *was* traumatized regarding my hair. (I know, how stupid right?? It's HAIR. But it's part of my identity and I took kids' cruel words to heart at a very young age.)  Anyway, all that to say, this book may not be for everyone. But it is a GOOD book filled with helpful information, organized in a very readable and concise way. She pitches her products but she ALSO pitches plenty of DIY solutions. I find it difficult to believe she wrote this book just to pitch a product. Her passion for curls is so *obvious* to me.   But you can read the book and decide for yourself. ;)

0446573019|5.0|U.S. Army's Criminal Investigative Division Warrant Officer John Puller, Jr. visits his brother Robert, a nuclear scientist convicted of treason at the US Disciplinary Barracks, but his sibling refuses to answer whether he did it or not.  Their father the famous Army hero would like to believe his oldest son did not betray his country.<br /><br />At Quantico, Puller's Special Agent in Charge Don White assigns the Warrant Officer to investigate the murder of Defense Intelligence Agency Colonel Matthew Reynolds in Drake, West Virginia.  The officer worked at the Pentagon, but what disturbs Puller is the DIA should be making the inquiry into the murder of the colonel, his wife and two teenage children in their rural home.  He makes contact with Sergeant Samantha Cole, the civilian homicide detective investigating the mass murders, but she considers him an unwanted outsider and acts accordingly towards cooperative Puller.<br /><br />This is a superb police procedural filled with a twist that takes a local rural homicide investigation spinning it into international waters as only David Baldacci can do and make it feel real.  Puller is terrific as the agent holding the story line together.  Readers will relish this fast-paced thriller as Zero Day has come to West Virginia and other nearby states.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B004EPZ07U|1.0|As with some of the other reviewers, I am extremely upset with the new Ultraviolet Digital Copy.  It is not a Digital Copy at all, but a way to stream the video over the internet.  After some effort, I was able to get the streaming video to work, but the quality of the video stunk.  It was not on par with a standard DVD.  I have already cancelled my accounts on Flixster so that the Digital Copy is no longer any value to me.  My biggest disappointment was that I cannot watch the movie on an iPad unless I am connected to wifi - including on a plane and when I go camping.  In my opinion, this is a blatant misrepresentation and I am personally hoping that someone starts a class-action lawsuit against Warner Brothers.  This will be the last DVD I purchase with Ultraviolet Digital Copy...
1439102732|4.0|\\"Sing You Home\\" was a good read. Addressed a situation I would never want to be in - who should get the child? The father or the mother in a lesbian relationship. I didn't like the speed with which the two women married - seemed unrealistic to me. The possibility of the problem which occurred, was plausible. Enjoyed reading the book.
0062101897|5.0|Wow, this is a huge book. It weighs in in the 5-6 pound range--but anyone who loved the films will very likely love the book. In another era, it'd've been called simply \\"The Making of Harry Potter.\\" The text is a fairly solid, quite readably written account of the process of turning JK Rowling's multiple volumes into multiple films. Costumers and serious film fans will love the many beautiful large-format photographs and sketches of characters, props, sets and costumes that fill this book from start to finish. The biggest simgle drawback?  It's a tossup between the $75 list price (expect it to fall off after the holidays, especially in the chains, or buy it here at Amazon) or the sheer size of the physical volume--you *really* need to lay this book flat to comfortably read/view it. Enjoy!
B001ANYDAO|3.0|I won't go into a detailed recap of this book, since I'm sure several others have already done so, much better than I could have. Instead, I'll focus on  Mr. Gladwell's main hypothesis, and where I feel he falls short.   The premise of Outliers seems to be as follows: there are no outliers. Well, at least in the sense that we have previously conceived of. Instead of seeing successful people as products of ingenuity and self-determination, Gladwell depicts them as a set of circumstances. He redefines popular stories of personal success as populations primed for success. The best example is the Canadian hockey team roster. Those born at the beginning of the year will be big for their artificially assigned age group. Thus, they will be recognized and promoted to better leagues, practice regimens, competition, etc.   Okay, that's interesting. Using sociological data to demonstrate a phenomenon we are already familiar with: success is part perspiration, and part luck. But what is so frustrating is that Gladwell misses opportunities to find true outliers. Why on earth doesn't he find the hockey player that WAS born late in the year and made his way to the All Star team?  Ultimately, Gladwell seems to succumb to inferential logic. Person X is successful. Person X lived in the following circumstances. Therefore, the following circumstances are the causes success. This leads to some interesting leaps of logic; I think this is the first book to suggest that Jews are in fact lucky. But it makes the first part of the book very difficult to get through.  Fortunately, the book starts to shine once Mr. Gladwell's sociological methodology is applied in broader strokes. I found his discussion on language and math fascinating, although after going through the first part of the book, I am reluctant to take anything said at face value.  There are so many individual fallacies glossed over in this book, it would be hard to list them all. For example, Gladwell casually states that being born in a demographic \\"trough\\" (in between population booms, like the Baby Boom) is beneficial, since there's less competition growing up. This flies in the face of current economic data, which shows that countries perform BETTER when they are in the midst of a population BOOM since there is a greater ratio of working adults to dependents (i.e. babies, retired people) ratio. Also, wouldn't we perform better if we had more classmates to push ourselves? That was the statement he made in his hockey parable.  There are several other little quibbles, like when he casually asserts that a Jewish banker coincidentally lived in a time when New York public schools happened to be better, neglecting to mention that Bronx Science is one of the most competitive schools to get into, even though it happens to be public. These wouldn't be a concern, except for the cavalier style in which Gladwell glosses over any assertion he makes, giving little room for debate.  Ultimately, if you're looking for an easy read that gives a quick rebuttal to the libertarian/Republican creed of \\"I pulled myself up by the boot straps\\" get your highlighter out and buy this book. If you're a firm believer in the independent spirit and self-determination, this might be a slog. I think its best to take the middle ground when it comes to this read: you want to enjoy well written prose that poses interesting questions with a hint or two, but inevitably forces you to find your own answers.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|This DVD does not come with a real Digital Copy of the movie.  It provides access to a Cloud version of the movie which requires you to be connected to a Wi-Fi network.  In other words, it is not compatible with Macs, iTunes nor an iPad / iPhone when you are in the car, bus, plane, etc.  For more information, I recommend you view some of the comments from the Green Lantern DVD release [...].  In my opinion, Ultraviolet Digital Copy is blatantly misleading and I refuse to purchase any more DVDs that don't come with a standard Digital Copy version.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Edited to reflect changes:<br /><br />This is one of those books I can go back and read every year.  Dune is great, but it's still not available as an ebook, and I don't know why.  I went with the audible copy instead, and its great.<br /><br />Original:<br />I had this book.  I've read it twice.  When I moved I left it so that the next person would be able to read it and enjoy it, knowing that I would probably get a digital version the next time I wanted to read it.  $14.99 for a 40 year old book that can be picked up in innumerable used book stores?  That much for a book that is 40 years old?  There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version.  Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass.  I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet.  Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake.  Set a reasonable price for this book, and I'd happily purchase it.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|Kelly's vocals are superb as always whether she's the Idol pop princess, the artistic scorned rocker or the Nashville country diva. The songs themselves are good but seem more like follow up songs to a monster hit, as if song A is a hit, then release song B, like most songs are the B style. I find the CD to be missing a song or two of great intensity like she usually has on her CDs. I'd say Let Me Down is the closest to it and after more thought, Honestly as well, perhaps not as intense by instrumentation but by her vocals. My favorites  to be added to my personal play list) are Dark Side, Honestly, Einstein, Hello (which I predict will be a DWTS song for a samba), Let Me Down. Others that I like but aren't cuckoo for cocoa puffs over are Mr. Know It All, What Doesn't Kill You, You Love Me and Don't Be a Girl About It especially because of it's silly but infectious woooo-oooos. Standing in Front of You is just too slow for me. Sadly, I don't care for the Jason Aldean duet mostly because Aldean's vocals seem to drown out Kelly's. And I don't like country music so any country flavored song always starts out in a deficit mode for me. Concerning that song, when it's just Kelly singing, it's great. I also find an odd background vocal on #17, The Sun Will Rise and after looking it up on the CD sleeve, it's Kara Dioguardi. Whoops. I would say not to guest vocal with a better singer. At least I wouldn't. All in all, the five star reviews are right just as the three star reviews are right. It kind of depends which Kelly is your favorite, the pop princess, the scorned rocker or the country diva.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I pre-ordered the new Fast Five DVD from Amazon a few weeks before it was to be released. I received the DVD in the mail on the exact date of release, it was great. The movie is awesome, I have already watched it so many times. I was very pleased with Amazon and how quick and easy it was to pre-order this DVD. It was also cheaper to pre-order from Amazon, then to pre-order it from Walmart or Target. I am very pleased with this transaction!
0141439793|5.0|I bought the Penguin Classics version of Northanger Abbey because their books are so well done.  They published a version with the original language, and add many notes to explain references to help a reader understand the context of a word or phrase.  The book itself is better than I had expected.  Many people dismiss it, possibly because it is not Pride and Prejudice, but I thoroughly enjoyed the novel.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I finally finished this series today... Now very rarely do I read and entire series from start to finish without stopping... For fear of burnout I read something else in between... But with Hunger Games I had no problem going straight through... I devoured every book in the series and though some may not have been I found myself completly satisfied with the ending... Happy, excited to see both Katnis and Peta return to a life that represented normal... Out of the spotlight, out of the way of harm, a nice beautiful ending to a series that held me on the grips from the begining to the end... this is sure to be one I will surely enjoy diving into again...
B005ELZKWS|4.0|For anyone who has grown up listening to all the different guys in Chickenfoot at one time or another (for those who don't know that's Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani, Michael Anthony, and Chad Smith) it's very difficult to NOT like what they put out since you basically know what you're getting. But this album is one of the best of the year so far IMO. \\"Big Foot\\" is a great first single from it. And songs like \\"Alright Alright\\" and \\"Three and a Half Letters\\" are just killer tracks as well that should be released IMO. Check out Chickenfoot if you haven't already folks, this is great stuff here and shouldn't be missed by anyone who is into classic hard rock!!

B005F3XV62|1.0|I love Kevin James.  I think that he is hilarious.  I knew walking in that `Zookeeper' had the poor reviews that usually indicate a real stinker, especially in this genre, but I always consider Kevin James a presence that can and usually does make even a terrible film worth watching at least once.<br /><br />Yeah, not so much for this one.<br /><br />Honestly, `Zookeeper' may be the worst film I've seen in a very long time.  There is very little funny here, in fact possibly nothing at all.  I think the ONLY time I even cracked a smile was during the wedding scene, and half of that was out of sheer awkwardness (but it was semi-humorous at that).  Overall, this film is a gigantic mess; a mix of wasted talent and uninspired regurgitation of potty humor that never hits where it intends.<br /><br />The story is that of an oaph of a man; Griffin.  He is a large bodied, simple living zookeeper that is undeniably sweet natured and so, somehow, a girl as hot and self-centered as Leslie Bibb is interested in dating him, only to reveal that his profession is too much for her to handle and so she turns his marriage proposal down.  Years later he's still dwelling in misery over it all.  He complains about his loneliness to his animal friends at the zoo and so when they see an opportunity to get Griffin and his long lost romance back together, they take action.  Soon they have Griffin roaring and walking with his package extended and peeing in potted plants and basically making a total fool of himself and yet, magically, it starts to work.  But, in changing himself he begins to regret his decisions and, well, you'll guess from the pretty early on who he's going to wind up with anyways; but that's the nature of the beast.<br /><br />Sadly, this talking animal flick has nothing to offer.  The animals are the worst part of the film.  I remember when Eddie Murphy did `Doctor Doolittle'.  Honestly, it was pretty clever and while some of the gags were predictable they were effective.  This is such a polar opposite.  The animals are crude and unfunny, and their interactions and staged comedic dialog is awkward and far too lowbrow for its own good.  The voice work, especially Sandler's, is obnoxious and cringe-worthy.  The `message' aspect of the film is poorly executed (the mean caretaker side of things was an afterthought entirely) and certain sequences are just too ridiculous (TGIF) that it makes this whole experience a complete and total waste.<br /><br />I still love you Kevin; I just advise you to steer clear of Adam Sandler.imals are crude and unfunny, and their interactions and staged comedic dialog is awkward and far too lowbrow for its own good.

0385732554|1.0|Read at my wife's suggestion knowing that I am a fan of dystopia novels. Cleary an indictment of socialist societies where individualism is anathema and the state is the culture (as opposed to fascistic societies where the culture becomes the state).  I do not fault the author for using the literary device of exaggeration to make her point, nor do I fault her for logical errors in her effort to create art, but what I found disturbing is the sub-textual moral of the story: that perhaps this present world we live in, rife w/ war, disease, poverty and injustice, is the best of all possible worlds, and that any attempt to engineer or manufacture a better, fairer or more just society, free of war, poverty and injustice, is at it's best, vain, and at it's worst, evil.  In this regard the novel ceases to be a cautionary tale and instead stands as yet another literary validation of the virtues of the bourgeois existence. I suspect that in years to come, the same morons who seek to ban this book from classrooms on specious pretense will come to hale it as a literary masterpiece exemplifying the necessity of unfettered, free market capitalism, the superiority of the \\"traditional\\" family unit, the supremacy of individualism and the unqualified sanctity of all human life (without regard for the deaths of the innocents which daily occur in the perpetuation of that myth).  I predict that Ms. Lowry will one day become the Ayn Rand of a new generation.  My sympathies are extended in advance.
B005EHNMWM|5.0|I am a newbie to the Wilco experience. I must say that after listening to \\"The Whole Love\\", I am a new follower of Wilco. This album is amazing.  I love it. It is very moody, thought provoking, and intelligent. I was  absolutley astounded after listening to \\"One Sunday Morning\\". I played it  over and over. This is one of the best songs I've ever heard. Period. These musicians deserve a Grammy for this song alone in my opinion. The intermittant piano keys add an amazing sadness and very deep emotional response. What a beautiful cascading effect of all instruments this song embodies. AMAZING.

B000K7VHQE|1.0|I purchased this video for a class assignment.  The video constantly freezes and I have missed crucial points in the movie due to the freezing.  I did not have the time to return the video and purchase another copy.  I made sure it was a new video and not a used copy to avoid this type of issue.  I will not buy any future videos from Amazon.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am writting about this DVD because it has literally changed my life. Over this summer of my sophmore year in college, I wanted to get a really good workout but I'm not really a runner. So I started doing this work out. Now here is a perspective of me. I have always been very active playing sports pretty much all year round. I have done a 5K (not well, but still did it) and I have always just been active. I didn't want to lose wieght, I just needed something to make sure that I stayed in shape. When I first looked at the workout of 3-2-1 I thought it may have been a joke and too easy. I wish i never thought this. This kicked my butt. I was dying the first time I did it and it was such a good feeling. I continued for the rest of the summer and actually found results that I didn't know I wanted. People kept telling me how good I was looking and I even saw the hint of a six pack. I began telling all my friends about it and now they have all started doing it and they are seeing the results they want.<br />For those just starting, you need to take your time. Just because it says 30 day shred doesn't mean you push past your limits. If you want results you really need to make sure that you push yourself and still don't hurt yourself. Another, what I think is an important factor, is that level 1 and 3 are the, well not easiest but the most tolerable. Level two is pretty much hell. I didn't do this for thirty days, more like 3 months, so I did level 2 for a month and I couldn't stand it the entire time. But get through it. If you do, level 3 is a godsent. Also don't stop ever. Jillian yells at you like she can see you and so you should never stop. Just saying. Stick to this program it's worth it.<br />I would recommend this to college kids who are far from the gym. This is the workout you need. Don't doubt it. All you need are weights. And speaking of them, don't think that once you get done with all three levels with the three pound weights you are done, farrrr from it. Thats when you step it up. I am now on Level three with five pound wieghts and I have been soo happy.<br />So get this. You will love it.hen you step it up. I am now on Level three with five pound wieghts and I have been soo happy.   So get this. You will love it.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|I am glad I waited until this came out on Blue-ray.  Ryan Reynolds did a good job but the story was \\"choppy\\".  I am not sure if it was a bad editing job or the screenwriter was not a very good story teller.  This movie had so much potential but up against the other super hero stories/movies it was my least favorite.

B002AOWXQ8|5.0|Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros sure does know how to create a debut album worth a million listens, even without the help of anyone named Edward Sharpe. The debut album, titled Up from Below, was released July 2009.   Frontman Alex Ebert and singer Jade Castrinos lead this group with their carefree love for music and folk/hippie styles. Ebert is a messy-haired, barefoot hippie whose love for music easily comes across in this album. The group creates lovable, happy-go-lucky music that makes it irresistible to join in and start singing along.   The name Edward Sharp comes from a messianic figure Ebert created. Ebert - also the lead singer of Ima Robot - was trying to get his life back on track after going through some tough times. He began to write a book that included the character Edward Sharpe, who acted as Ebert's alter-ego. A little later, Ebert met fellow band member Castrinos in Los Angeles, where they then formed the group Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros. They have been touring and creating music ever since.   Their debut album truly sets the stage for other up-and-coming folk/rock artists. With a band that is genuinely happy to be playing music - an important aspect of music many bands lack today - the bar is set high. They may not have a huge fan base or an overwhelming amount of experience in today's music scene, but they sure do have talent.   Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros use their large size to their advantage. A variety of instruments can be heard throughout the entire album, including a trumpet that adds a lively, up-beat sound. But don't let the collaboration of instruments fool you - the singing is by far one of the best attributes of this band. Ebert and Castrinos are a duo that could take this band far. And, there's nothing better than the entire band singing together during a chorus or contributing unique, tidbit tunes here and there throughout each song. Everything about this group just seems right.   Easily the most popular songfrom their album, \\"Home\\" has a very catchy tune - you may even find yourself singing (and whistling!) the tune for the next couple of weeks. \\"Home\\" is an easy-to-listen-to love song with its mellow simplicity that captures the attention of anyone even remotely interested. This song is a true foot-tapper that you can never get enough of.   \\"Janglin\\" is another standout song from this album. It starts out with a simple, acoustic sound that evolves into the group singing a silly \\"mmmbop\\" tune and transforms into Ebert singing with a classic, `old-time' sound. When the group comes together to sing the chorus, a whole new element is added. In a split second, the song goes from great to exceptionally fun and incredible.   Another fan favorite is \\"40 Day Dream,\\" a song that immediately starts out with a beat worth getting into. It may be a little slower than some of their other songs, but it certainly doesn't disappoint. The stripped-down vocals near the end of the song show just how well this group can manipulate instruments and vocals to create a distinguished sound that works well for them.   If you're looking for an album that's different and refreshing, this is the one to check out. Up from Below is a mix of classic and contemporary tunes transformed into a folk-indie album. It easily contains some of the best songs released in recent years, so pick up a copy of Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros' debut album, and don't worry about wiping that ear-to-ear grin off your face after you take a listen.
B0051GOB26|5.0|I'm sure everyone's impression/experience with this movie is different, but I'll be honest, the first time I saw The Big Lebowski, I struggled through it, and afterwards, formed the opinion that I didn't really care for it that much.  It had been built up so much in my mind as a \\"classic\\" and \\"cult film\\" that I had this idea that suddenly the cherubic choir would chime and I'd face the realization it was the best movie I'd ever seen, or at least top five.<br /><br />It wasn't...but now it is.  How does this happen?  Every time I watch The Big Lebowski, it gets better.  Maybe I see another angle I didn't see before, maybe a detail that is new, perhaps even something that appears in a different context than each time previous, just because of where I am in life.  Whatever the reasons, it now has really become a film that I feel is damn-near flawless, and when coupled with a couple White Russians, makes you feel so good, it can sometimes become the best part of your day.  I suspect the Cohen brothers didn't even have the long-reaching scope in mind that this movie has when they made it...but like any good art, it morphs and becomes many different things to many different people.<br /><br />As for the Bluray, it looks great, but sounds phenomenal, and its one of the first Blurays I've bought that I've appreciated the sound more than the picture resolution.  It fills up your flatscreen with an immersive experience that simmers you down and mellows you out, and like The Dude, allows you to, for a short time viewing just \\"abide\\".  I wish all movies did that.
0515149489|5.0|Nora Roberts has always had a knack for romance and mystery. Even when you think you know the book from beginning to end, Nora is always a step ahead to keep you reading until the last page is read. What I found so good about this book is not so much Fiona, but of Simon and dogs. I can't remember a book that had me laughing at least once a page since I was reading back in high-school. It is a truly wonderful mix of romance, mystery along with a man'g ego and man's best friend to boot. By far, one of, if not the best Nora Roberts has ever written and I have read. Nora had taken a step back and did some very good outside the box thinking on this one. I would not be surprised if one of her future books would be based on the story of a guy that needs a girl, instead of the other way around. Thanks Nora, this one is 5 stars!
B000YDCFRE|4.0|Great shoe and looks great, the chicks dig it because they like a man in some boots. I rock these almost everyday now, since its raining everyday.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I must say that \\"Puss In Boots\\" is a very creative and dynamic movie that is suitable for all ages.  Antonio Banderas brilliantly plays the role of the cat \\"Puss In Boots\\" who is back to engage in a journey to reclaim his honor.  Salma Hayek also does a clever performance as \\"Kitty Softpaws\\". Kitty Softpaws  ends up accompanying Puss in Boots in his quest to restore his reputation, and capture magic beans.  Zach Galifianakis (from the Hangover movie) plays the role of Humpty Dumpty. Humpty Dumpty is a past friend of Puss in Boots and greatly shapes his character evolution through subtle psychological tests.  Billy Bob Thornton (of the Bad Santa movie) and Amy Sedaris play the \\"outlaws\\" Jack and Jill.  Jack and Jill have the magic beans that Puss in Boots wants to covet.  My only caveat with this film is that Jack and Jill were intentionally made to be overweight, plain-looking, and evil.  This reinforces the stereotype that only attractive people are capable of humanity and compassion.  It is common knowledge that there are beautiful people that are both cold and calculating. I would have liked to see villain characters that reflected \\"wolf in sheep's clothing\\" rather than the usual generic stereotype of only plain people being abrasive.  Aside from this, \\"Puss in Boots\\" is an engaging animation movie.  I would highly recommend this film for anyone that enjoyed any of the Shrek films.
B002ZG999U|2.0|Sylvester Stallone is Barney Ross, who leads a group of (aging) mercenaries and accepts a contract that leads the team to some remote island nation to kill its military head. While on location, Stallone's character falls for some unlikely lady in an attempt to sneak some plot into this movie that is really just an all-star cast for fighting sequences and big explosions. I love fighting sequences. I love big explosions. I love movies with Jason Statham and movies with Jet Li and movies with...each of the guys in this movie (Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, Terry Crews and Mickey Rourke). So one movie with all of them together is intriguing, right? There is one AMAZING action sequence that is worth seeing, but the rest of the movie fails to entertain. Consider The Expendables to be the action-equivalent to what [[ASIN:B000QFCD7W Wild Hogs]] was for comedy; a last hurrah of sorts for a cast that has been around the block a few too many times.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|A feast of unleashed guitar and the street-wise, raunchy voice of Beth Hart have had me winding up the volume in my car and choosing the longer routes to my destinations. The music they grew up listening to is the music I grew up listening to, so this was like bumping into someone I've always known......but can't explain why I've never heard them before.

B005H1SDQU|5.0|after about 30 seconds, I knew I was listening to Steve Hackett, and it felt good. After about 3 minutes, my excitement levels were rising. It sounded like this might be a great Steve Hackett CD. After 30 minutes, I was listening to more than just a Classic Steve Hackett CD. This was something special, and I was salivating. By the end, It was over too soon and I had to listen again.  This CD seems to bring the many sides of Steve's musical nature together like never before. Lush sounds, compelling rock and rhythms, beautiful harmonies, guitars that soar, and guitars that leave one's soul at rest, all woven together so seamlessly and beautifully. This sounds like not only an artist at his best, but a man who has found himself, at peace and at home. There is just so much joy and enthusiasm for life shining through here.  As good as Out of the Tunnels Mouth was, this is easily my favourite Hackett experience in years, if not ever. As many of his contemporaries struggle to be creative, it's hard to imagine that he could improve on this, but one now suspects that he can and will. Thanks Steve.

1451648537|2.0|This is a very disappointing biography. It is very superficial. The beginnings of Apple is best covered in books that were published in the 90s. The 1997-2011 saga does not says things you may not have read in the newspapers before. The author, Walter Isaacson, doesn't seem to grasp fully what make Apple products unique. For example he doesn't mention the main reason behind the early iPod success which was its ability to synchronize fast with a computer (within minutes, instead of hours for other mp3 players at the time - although ease of use ensure lasting success afterwards). I did not learn anything new in this bio, except for things related to Steve Jobs' disease. It seems the author rushed to write this bio.

B001K98MFU|4.0|First of all, the first pressing of the DVD had an error in which only subtitles for the hearing impaired were available. There was a notice posted on the company website, with an address to send for a replacement disc with the proper subtitles. My replacement disc was just fine. Rookie mistake yes, but there was an opportunity to make it right. Second, there was no dub available on the initial DVD release because at the time, no dub had been made. GoFish, the company who brought this film to North America, decided that no dub was necessary, as it would take away from the integrity and original intent of the film. I am inclined to agree. I applauded the decision to release the film in theatres and dvd exclusively as it was originally intended, it its native language. The dubbed version that is included on the Blu-Ray release was done in England (if I remember correctly) quite some time after the original release.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Columbia Pictures presents \\"GILDA\\" (1945) ~ (110 min/B&W) ~ Starring: Rota Hayworth, Glenn Ford, George Macready, Joseph Calleia & Steven Geray<br /><br />Directed by Charles Vidor<br /><br />When wealthy Ballin Mundson (George Macready) rescues down at his heels gambler Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) and invites him to the Buenos Aires casino he owns, both men get more than they wagered on. Farrell convinces Mundson to hire him as casino manager, but is shocked when Mundson introduces his new bride, and Farrell's old flame, Gilda (Rita Hayworth).Though Farrell is unwavering in his loyalty to his employer, and he and Gilda treat each other with contempt, Mundson realizes that the torch never died for either of the former lovers. Ordered to guard Gilda, Farrell tries to convince himself that he's protecting Mundson's interests, but Gilda sees through his self-deception. Meanwhile, Mundson reveals to Farrell that his primary business is control of an international tungsten cartel that he plans to use to further his fascist ends.<br /><br />Great tight tense script, direction and cast makes an all-time classic noir, but it's George Macready who gives such an icy cold character  performance, that when he's on the screen nobody else seems to be there, even though Hayworth and Ford are steaming up the cameras with their hot steaming scenes.<br /><br />* Special footnote: ~ Rita Hayworth had to wear a corset while shooting \\"Put the Blame on Mame,\\" as she gave birth to her first daughter, Rebecca, months before filming ~ In the scene where Gilda is brought back to Argentina by Tom, she slaps Johnny hard across both sides of his face. In reality, Rita Hayworth's smacks broke two of 'Glenn Ford''s teeth. He held his place until the take was finished ~ The photo of Johnny Farrell as a baby is a picture of 'Glenn Ford''s real-life son, Peter Ford.<br /><br />BIOS:<br />1.

031606792X|5.0|I have read the previous three books and I have to say that I was not disappointed! I am 26+ and I thoroughly enjoyed these classic tales  of love, desire, and hard decissions. In reading the previous reviews, I have to say that I was very shocked! But then again maybe these books are a little more in depth and not quiet for the younger readers that they are sometimes advertised towards. I have made it a tradition since my fiance bought me the box set 3 years ago, to read the Twighlight series every year around Halloween! My Sister loves them too and she is also 25+. The story line is intriging and romantic with a little bit of drama due to the love triangle! I do like that the story has a happy ending as well. Im not sure why readers were complaining about that. In my own life I can relate to Bella getting what she wants in the end! But I am also an optomistic person and do not enjoy the books where everyone dies. This forth and final book ties together all the lose ends and answer the questions that the readers have at the end of the third book! The writing leaves nothing lacking and lets the imagination create a perfect picture as the scenes come alive![[ASIN:B0015DYIH2 Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga Book 4)]]I think that Stephanie Meyers is a genius and I would love to see her come out with something else in the paranormal fiction line!
B0033AI4F2|1.0|The single star is for Universal and NOT this brilliant film. The 'To Kill a Mockingbird' blu ray has been up for pre-order since January. That is deplorable. Universal continually does a bad job with their great classic catalogue. From the Hitchcocks to the Monster movies of the 30s and 40s will be neglected because Universal doesn't believe in upgrading these treasures to blu ray. They don't think old movies will make them money. Shame on them.  Amazon, you should pull this from pre-order. It will never happen.
B005IZLPKQ|1.0|The only good thing about this movie is the special effects. The script and acting are horrible. Also, the ending is stupid.
B005WTR4ZI|2.0|This is an OK book in the sense that it explains quite clearly and with some good, up-to-date, examples why most people's current jobs are in danger of being replaced by various forms of automation. This is clearly a very important issue that most people (especially those whose jobs are about to disappear) have not sufficently brought into focus. Unfortunately, beyond that the book does not provide any great depth of analysis nor any particularly novel or compelling recommendations for the future.
B0053TMP24|3.0|If you're contemplating getting this, you probably don't need a review to sway you: You've come this far in the Percy Jackson saga, may as well keep going, right? But kids of all ages will get frustrated trying to read this on the Kindle, as the editing is absolutely horrendous. Words bunched together improperly or split in the wrong place, sometimes even so bad you can't say that machine editing is the only problem. If this wasn't a short, fun, kids' adventure romp and I was more concerned with the style of prose, it would have been too distracting to move forward. Thankfully, Riordan's about as far from Conrad as you can get, and it's pretty easy to get through, but still distracting. So the tl;dr version? Riordan great, Kindle edition needs serious help.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was recommended this Video by my Health Coach.  It is 20 minutes and what a work out.  I use the excuse I have no time to exercise.  I committed to 20 minutes a day.  This is amazing.  I was so out of shape that about 3 days into doing this video I felt muscles I had not felt for years.  My health coach recommended I do Level 1 for 10 days, take a one day break.  Next Level 2 for 10 days take a one day break.  Next Level 3.  If you don't like exercise, I recommend this video.  It is all in one.  Stretching, Strength and Cardio.  Best money I spent for myself.  I also like to mention, I'm not in shape and very obese.  It is a struggle to do this video, but I can tell a difference in doing it.

B005IZLPMY|3.0|I was really disappointed in this movie.  It could have been so much better.  It's mediocre at best.  They phoned it in.  There are some bright moments, but overall it's a disappointment.  I didn't catch it in the theater, so I  went ahead and bought the bluray thinking it was likely a safe bet.  Now I wish I'd have redboxed it first, and saved the money for something else.
B004ZY0VHY|1.0|This was awful. It was pretentious, self-important, self-righteous, trite, and pathetically indifferent. And that was just the writing style. The entire book is written as letters from the killer's mother to her husband. The format is awkward and nowhere near believable. The author seems to be trying for cathartic self-analysis. What comes across is self-absorption that's both painful to endure and boring to read. The main character isn't just \\"difficult\\"; she's inherently unlikeable. I actually hated her by the end of the first chapter. Trust me, you CAN find something better to do for an afternoon than suffer through this book.

This controller has a HUGE deadzone in it, if you are unfamiliar it is the point where from center analog position to the point where it actually responds to a movement, and is a huge breaker for anyone playing FPS games or any kind of accuracy control is needed. Secondly upon arrival the left analog stick also gets stuck in the right position A LOT, it will get stuck like this and you must push it all the way to the left to correct, this will fix it for another minute or so until it it finally gets stuck again in the right side position. *It is EXTREMELY annoying* Thats not where it stops either; the D-pad is so poorly constructed that at any point where you press one direction a vast majority of the time it will also hit another d-pad direction, I found this most annoying when playing Zelda on the PC and was constantly selecting the wrong C button item or firing of arrows when trying to look around.   The triangle square circle and X keys are also not of very high quality, low profile buttons *which some people will like* but barely visible and seem very loose in their drilled area.  End of story worst constructed controller ever and don't recommend to anyone.
B003Y5D776|1.0|I bought this device to use with an older computer that I have that runs Window Vista.  The manufacturer's description claims that it works with Windows Operating Systems. NO WHERE in that description does it state that it does not work with Windows Vista.  I will avoid anything made by Griffin Technology in the future.
0452287022|5.0|I picked this up to read on the train on my way to Mauritshuis, the museum in The Hague in which the title painting hangs. It was an easy and entertaining afternoon read. There was enough history to add a bit to my experience of the Vermeer painting, as well as a nearby Rembrandt (featuring a character in one of the \\"paternity caps\\" described in this book). Too often historical fiction seems to have stories wildly contorted to fit the history. In this mostly sweet tale, the history was added subtly to fit the story.
B0054N73EY|5.0|Bought the CD for the song Rain Dance Maggie and found that I really like at least half the songs, so far.  This CD is a good as any by RHCP which isn't a surprise.   A little more \\"relaxed\\" than previous albums but every bit as good. Something new for the Peppers.  It still rocks though!

6305428042|3.0|My sister and I have loved Hocus Pocus since we were girls; and I ordered it for her for Halloween this year. It was supposed to arrive today for the holiday; but not only did it not arrive; when I went to the \\"track your package\\" link here on Amazon; it showed a departure from the site in West Virginia, but the next thing it showed was an arrival date in Kansas City, KS; completely bypassing Illinois! It would have had to go through the region in Illinois in which we live to get from one site to the other! This is completely ridiculous. I have never had a problem like this from Amazon before and I hope not to again; but I am very disappointed and unhappy with the shipping mishaps I have experienced with this order.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I made sure that I listened to the album a bunch of times before I reviewed it.  Although there are some \\"hits\\" on Mylo, such as Paradise, Don't Let it Break Your Heart, and Every Teardrop is a Waterfall, the major takeaway is that this is meant to be listened straight through, which seems to be making a comeback amongst some bands, like Green Day, Decembrists, etc.  There are some high points, Up in Flames hits the mood just right, but Paradise seems to be a forced anthem, and seems to be peripheral to the album's musical flow.  Meanwhile, the critics have not been raving, it's tough when every move you make is so scrutinized, and anything you do compares you to U2.  Otherwise, give it a try.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent writing, super story, well developed characters. This series leaves you wanting more! A high school student recommended the books and I spent the weekend reading the series.  What a fun change to be on the receiving end.
B005OIAFQC|5.0|Just got my copy in the mail! I'm really enjoying this album. I'd say it's probably their most \\"pop\\" album, so it takes a bit to get used to. (Even more pop than Futureperfect.) Favorite tracks are Space & Time, Control, and Photon.

B001FSDOZO|2.0|Dark Horse from Nickelback is one of the most mediocre efforts I've ever heard. While there are some great songs (Burn It To The Ground, If Today Was Your Last Day, and the ballad tracks), most of this record falls completely flat, and some songs have allude to sexual content, which plagues the rock genre in general, especially in the appropriately titled, \\"S.E.X\\". Why the heck does this appeal to so many people? I don't understand. Also, another song named Next Go Round states the following:<br /><br />I wanna cover you with Jello in the tub<br />We can roll around for hours without ever coming up<br />I want you naked with your favorite heels on<br />Slap John Deere across my @$$ and ride me up and down the lawn<br /><br />This is some of the worst material Nickelback has come up with, and some of the worst I've ever heard in the rock genre, no offense to the band in general, because they can come up with good material. Also, this part of the song is really uninspired, and also makes you scratch your head.<br /><br />Well, all I can say now is, when Here and Now comes on November 21, 2011, they had at least step up their game, and at least tone down the sexual content. Kroeger, that's all I'm asking. Is that complicated?<br /><br />Rating: 2 stars/5 stars

B003Y5HWGI|4.0|Me and my hubby have been fans of Desperate Housewives since season one. I have to admit however that season seven disappointed both of us a little bit. Now do not get me wrong, this season is still good, but it is a little bit different from the other seasons and I am not to thrilled about the changes. Now Desperate Housewives have a pretty wide demographics, and part of the reason for this is that the show have mixed together several themes. You have the drama off course, but you also have allot of humor, at times rather dark humor and in each season there have been a mystery that drives thing along even if drama might not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />Usually each season there is a new neighbor and they have a dark secret which is then slowly revealed over the season's episodes and go through many twists until it is finally solves in the last episode, this however have been completely removed in season seven, there are no mystery, yes there are two villains, but it is revealed to the audience from the get go what their intentions are so there are no mystery there. In addition the dark humor have been reduced, now the episodes is still funny but not as funny as in earlier seasons, it seams that the show's creators have sacrificed everything else to focus on the drama. Now the drama in this season is good, the character's dilemmas is played in a way that make you feel for the character, and if the drama is what you found most attractive about Desperate Housewives then you might like this season better than earlier seasons, however if you are like me and my hubby and it was the mystery plots and the humor which where the most attractive parts of the series then you might become a little disappointed.<br /><br />Now another thing I had a problem with in this season is that the characters seam a bit of. Especially Bree acts a bit out of character, yes she have evolved from the very repressed woman we see in season one, but in this season she sleeps around, find it cute when her date call her a former prostitute to try to inspire a young girl to get out of prostitution and so on. Bree have evolved yes but when we last saw her in season six she was still prim and proper, now she is not, she still dresses the part but do not act it. This at times strange way of handling the characters is the only real flaw as such about this season, the rest I complain about is the producers taking the series in new directions, which I do not agree with, but this slip up when it comes to the behavior of several of the characters and in particularly Bree is distracting as I sit thinking that character would not act that way instead of concentrating on the story.<br /><br />Another change in this season that you may or may not like is that the stories is presented in a story arch fashion. Usually in this series the stories lasted the entire season, and sometime several seasons, and then one episode focused more on one or two of the storylines, in season seven it is more short, few episodes story arks and then that plot get resolved and go away. In a way this makes the series easier to follow and allow for many good little story arks and the producers have done a good job in fitting the small storylines into a whole, I personally however prefers the longer storylines of the other seasons. One thing I did not like however is that at times bombshells are dropped and then never addressed again. I will take one example, spoiler warning, to illustrate my point. Tom's mother comes to live with Lynette and her husband to help take care of the children, then it turns out she is starting to become demented this lead to a crushing scene where Tom is forced to send her to a retirement home and she is never mentioned again. If you are going to build up drama arount a sick family member, follow up on it.<br /><br />This season also introduces a new housewife, a self centered, vain former celebrity wife named Renee. I think this character where very good and I gotallot of lengths from her comments and just how this diva tries to fit into suburbia. Renee also have a few good dramatic storylines so I say she is a good addition to the cast of characters.<br /><br />Now from all these complaints you might think I did not like Desperate Housewives season 7, this is not true. Both me and my hubby enjoyed the season. The drama is good, there is still a decent amount of good humor and it continues a very good story from earlier seasons. I am not saying this is not a good season it is, the characters (except for the problems I have already described are good), the actors are brilliant and the series itself is exiting. I just think that this is the weakest season on a great series, that still make the season good, but just not as good as the earlier seasons. I do recommend that you get this DVD set if you are a fan of Desperate Housewives, there is nothing series breaking bad here, but be aware that the tone and structure of the series have gone through some changes and not all of them favorable.just how this diva tries to fit into suburbia.

B003Q6D25U|5.0|This movie is awesome, it's a must watch if u haven't yet watched it, it's great if you love scary movies.
B004EPYZOO|3.0|Driving Angry is about a man names Milton who escapes hell to go hunting for a devil worshiping sect that killed his daughter and are panning to sacrifice his baby granddaughter. On his way Milton meets Piper a woman who definitely is not your average damsel in distress and get her to help in him his quest. The rest of the movie is basically insane car chases, gunfights, car chases with gunfights, sex and a race against time to save the little girl, avoid the hellish bounty hunter who are sent to take Milton back to hell and find the devil worshiping could and lay waste to it. This movie is what you get if you take Ghost Rider but make it far more edgy and violent than Marvel would ever allow.<br /><br />I had allot of fun watching this movie. It is pure, mind nubbing action entertainment and nothing else, but sometimes a movie do not need to be more. The characters are all good. Milton is a typical Cage character, Piper is interesting, the leader of the devil worshiping cult is just such a jerk that you can not wait for him to get his just desert, and the Accountant, the man from hell sent to bring Milton back is mysterious and a hoot to watch. In short the characters work, you want the good guys to win and enjoy watching the bad guys get what they have coming. The special effects are all great and the car chases are inventive and fun to watch. I also loved the whole idea of hell as a prison with Satan as a warden, that is an interesting take on the whole concept of hell.<br /><br />If I am going to have one complaint about this movie it would have to be the sex, there is allot of it and it at times very graphic. Now I am not a prude but this is not really necessary, it do not give me anything when the movie suddenly decides to turn into a porno. Yes I know they where going for violent and gritty, but we know what they are doing and how it works so please get done with the sex and get back to the plot, a movie do not get more dark or more gritty just because it have allot of graphic sex.<br /><br />All in all Dive Angry is a decent film, is in mindless entertainment but it succeeds at that. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes supernatural action movies or just action film in general. You will not get wiser or learn anything from this movie, but you will definitely be entertained.ex.  All in all Dive Angry is a decent film, is in mindless entertainment but it succeeds at that.

B005N38GFK|5.0|I'm a 50-something who has been a Sco fan since the early 80's.  I think this is the best album he's ever released.  His phrasing is tasteful and toneful over some beautiful arrangements.  His tone is woody and warm,  and the album has an intimacy and a gentle vibe that reminds me of Bill Evans. Scofield has nothing to prove -- he's an American jazz master -- and his easy approach to these songs demonstrates a confidence that can only come from experience. This is Sco at his highest and best ... you won't be disappointed.
0425241505|4.0|On my last Amazon order I needed 2 more books, one for the 4 for 3 offer and one more for the free shipping.  Dragon Bound kept showing up on my Amazon recommendations so I decided to give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  I loved the book, in fact I loved it so much I went out and purchased Storm's Heart the next book in the series.  Loved that one too.  I am a new Thea Harrison fan.<br /><br />Pia Givovanni as spent her life hiding the fact that she is half human and half Wyr.  That changes when she is blackmailed into sealing from Dragos Cuelebre, the dragon Wyr who controls the Northeast.  Even then she uses her head and only steals a small coin, replacing it with one note of apology and a coin of equal value.  From there the hunt and adventure is on.<br /><br />Pia and Dragos are both wonderful characters who complement each other in spite of their differences.  In addition to Pia and Dragos there are a host of secondary characters just ready for their own story.  Thea Harrison has done really good world building and character development.  Dragon Bound is a great start to an intriguing new series.<br /><br />Dragon Bound is filled with danger, adventure, betrayal, and romance.  The story moves at a great pace and kept my attention throughout the book.  I expect this series to be as popular as the ones written by Nalini Singh.<br /><br />Book three, Serpents Kiss is out now.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|That's right, it was about time someone stood up to those Nazis. After all these years of them getting a pass from the rest of society, here comes Quentin to stick it to them! A true lone voice in the wilderness...  Anyway, if shallow masturbatory revenge fantasies are your bag, you'll love Inglourious Basterds.   Actually, there are scenes that work well in this film, but for every one that works there is another that is ridiculous. It can't seem to decide what to wants to be. It's one of those frustrating films that you can feel a good film trying to get out of but it fails.   Brad Pitt plays a one-dimensional American army Lt. from Tennessee that so hates the Nazis that he demands 100 Nazi scalps from those under his command. Never-mind the civil rights violations going on within his own country at the time this film is supposed to take place. One wonders if he demands 100 Klu Klux Klan scalps from anyone back there. Probably not. But since this film clearly happens in some alternate universe, America probably doesn't have racists in this world, rather it's most likely the white washed \\"good ol days\\" version of America that so many wish we could go back to. Unless they just happen to not be white.  Pitt's character is fond of carving swastikas into Nazi foreheads. This is supposed to be so that they can never take off their Nazi uniforms and blend back into society. It sounds somewhat brutally logical, but for the fact that today those who espouse Nazi ideals will gladly tattoo such symbols on their bodies. One wonders what the point is. Tarantino likes the idea of going back to the middle ages where criminals were branded with symbols of their crimes?    People seem to like this film though so I wonder if Quentin can make a series of films out of it. How about Native Americans that wipe out Andrew Jackson and his cronies and the rest of those land grabbing, genocidal European invaders. Or African-American slaves that wipe out Robert E. Lee and his gang of southern slave masters (who then may as well proceed to kill of most of the North as well). How about middle easterners storming the Vatican taking out the Pope and all his Crusader cronies. The Chinese invading Japan and paying them back for Nanking? Hmm, somehow I doubt any of that would play as well.  Apparently Tarantino does not subscribe to the notion that an eye for any eye makes the whole world blind. He seems to subscribe to the only way to fight monsters is to stare into the abyss and become one yourself. That's ok, cause its really cool to be a monster. The end doesn't justify the means, but the cool certainly does. Welcome to the world of Tarantino.   A good point: Christoph Waltz delivers a wonderfully chilling performance in this film. It begs for a good movie to be presented in.

When Atticus O'Sullivan is tells people he is 21 they think years, he means centuries.  Atticus is just the first of a large cast of wonderful characters.  There is a very angry Celtic god that wants a sword belonging to Atticus, a goddess of death, a vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a sexy bartender who shares her body with a Hindu witch and best of all is Oberon, Atticus's Irish wolfhound, a dog that can communicate.<br /><br />Filled with well-developed characters, a great story line, and fast paced action Hounded kept me reading.

B000001ESP|5.0|I love most of Rush's works but this and 2112 are the works that got the name known. If you haven't heard at least one of these songs once somewhere, then you better crawl out from under your rock because a few of these songs are still frequently played on radio stations. Geddy, Alex, and Neil have put together a fantastic album and whether you think so or not, this was groundbreaking back then and perhaps some aspects about it still are...  Moving Pictures? No this is Moving Music! Not emotionally moving, but constantly shifting in time and key:  1. Tom Sawyer- If you haven't heard this, then you seriously need help...unless you are below age 20 right now, I defy anyone who claims that they have never heard this song. Very catchy, very awesome, very....RUSH! Nobody else but Rush would've come up with this, and that's how the rest of the album is.  2. Red Barchetta- I never really liked this song, but now it's grown on me and I think it's pretty cool. Its about like a car race or something and its a pretty cool tune. I like it now.  3. YYZ- Rush is famous for many things, but instrumentals are among them. YYZ is no exception, this song is cool. I don't really like rock instrumentals and yet I like this one! Very nice work here!  4. Limelight- This one wasn't a BIG single like Tom Sawyer, but just the same, if you haven't heard it, you need to. This one and the next one are my favorites of the album and have very nice music.  5. The Camera Eye- My favorite song on this album. At 11 min and 1 second, this is the last monster Rush has released to date. I really like the whole song and it would be a great single except for the length.  6. Witch Hunt- I like this one too. It's not the best but I like the melody and beat behind it.  7. Vital Signs- This is how you end an album: with a very catchy song. I like this one a lot, too. It sounds like a mix of Rock, Techno, and Reggae in a Rush way.  Verdict: Buy it. If you are a metal head, odds are they were influenced by Rush. Dream Theater, Symphony X, Metallica, Primus, Iron Maiden ect...All got influenced by these 3 dudes known as RUSH. If you don't get this one, then I highly recommend 2112 which I find a bit better than this one anyway. Rush are timeless because they never cared about what was popular and what wasn't...they just said \\"we are making an album that's us\\" and they haven't let me down yet. Take a chance and buy it!

B005G4TJI4|1.0|The acting is horrible.  The story is nonexistent.  This is a movie that is surely not worth your time.  The special effects are its one redeeming factor, but they can't redeem this movie.  The only good thing about this compared to Transformers 2 is that there is less screaming in this one.
B0016KJKIG|4.0|Before I got this, I had the original style pouch, wich was just 2 pieces of nylon sewn together at the edges and i loved it. This new pouch is simply too big. It has enough room to hold my leatherman Surge, the extra saw/file blades, and the screwdriver bit set, and still holds the knife loosely with everything inside. if you dont have all of the stuff inside of it though, the pouch is too loose for the knife. When full, it sticks out from my belt about 2 1/8\\", A full 1/2\\" more than my old pouch. It is way too bulky for every-day-carry. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because it does hold the entire set quite well, and the vertical loops will fit on a 2\\" duty belt almost perfectly. For that reason, I will keep it on my bug out gear for now and keep my eye out for the old style pouch. All in all, I would recommend it for a utility purpose, but only if you have the bit set and dont plan to carry it every day.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|This album sounds way too much like Coldplay's last album which was an average album. I've read reviews on how they have reinvented their music with this album. Not at all.

B005XOPEOU|3.0|Coldplay's new record is the perfect portrait on where they are as a band how they're trying to walk away from their confort zone in order to find themselves again as a band. And, as in these cases is usually seen that this kind of records have their highlights and flaws. Definitely a band like Coldplay fits nicely enough with this kind of pop full of synths, keyboards and samplers but, eventhough most of the songs are good it feels that they were produced to fit in charts and MTV. The finest examples of what I'm saying is the awful tune called \\"Princess of China\\" feat. Rhianna (an irrelevant pop singer if you ask me). That must be the worst Coldplay song because it just has no identity at all and it just doesn't make me feel a thing and, if anything it annoys me. On the other hand, \\"Charlie Brown\\" is definitely my favorite on the record, specially because it reminds me so much to something that U2 would do. For the rest of the songs they are alright but, \\"MX\\" is far from being their best release. I like this band and their last record \\"Viva la Vidal\\" was a solid effort but \\"MX\\" lacks the deepness of its predecessor. I just hope on their next album they are  aware where they're going with their sound before it's too late.
193413712X|2.0|I made the mistake of reading the professional reviews on this book which influenced my purchase.    You know how when you read movie reviews and they show the little cartoon guy standing and clapping.  Those are usually the worst movies I have ever seen.  I think that is what happened with this book.  Or maybe it was just way too far over my head.  I couldn't get passed chapter 2 , very strange story .  What am I missing???

1451648537|2.0|I believe Steve Jobs was ready to tell a story, the story of his life, with his motivations, his drive, his fears and his joys. I believe he had a lot to say. Walter Isaacson decided to quite what Steve had to say for the sake of an objectively written journalism piece. A semi auto-biography, commissioned by the subject himself is not meant to be objective. It is meant to make the reader understand what was really going on inside that person. Now that information is gone with him and we will never know.<br /><br />Thanks Walter, you could have written it all after he was dead and without having the privilege of having known him the way he allowed you to! I guess you forgot that this time your subject was actually alive, unlike the others you have written about.<br /><br />Steve made a lot of decisions and acted in many ways differently than many of us, \\"think different\\" was HIS mantra. In the book there was not a single reference to the reasoning behind the thinking. He managed to make Steve Jobs look like a total ass-hole in the process but he never answered the question to the \\"why\\" he chose to act that way. The only answer we get from Steve is: I am that way, what can you do... Everybody knows he was deeper than that...<br /><br />Steve Jobs would be hating what he wanted to be his side of the story. Sadly he won't have the chance to fix it like he normally would have excelled at doing and this will remain as his \\"official biography\\", what a pity...

0062011847|5.0|Dragged on \\"vacation\\" by his wife, Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork night watch, expects to be bored. In Ankh-Morpork, the streets themselves speak to him while he walks the beat. Here in the countryside, he can't sleep because of the silence. Still, his cop instincts pick up something. There's the young blacksmith in town who's just a little too angry and too class-conscious. Then there is the discrete whispering always going on among the nobles living in the countryside. When the blacksmith invites Vimes to meet with him and Vimes discovers, instead, a pool of blood, he abandons his pretenses at crime. He's a cop and it's his job to fight injustice--even when he's way out of his jurisdiction. Even when the \\"people\\" demanding justice are widely considered to non-human pests.<br /><br />With the help of his cold-blooded \\"gentleman's gentleman,\\" Vimes co-opts the local constable who is sent to arrest him, and sets off on an investigation... always trying to make it back in time for his son's story-time. Young Sam (Vimes's son) has, at this point, become fascinated with poo--to the extent that he's developing an extensive collection of catalogued poo for dissection and study. Back in Ankh-Morpork, the city watch is confounded when one of their officers finds a mysterious goblin bottle that seems to trap him, making him unable to work and quickly sickening him. Through no coincidence, goblins are also at the heart of Vimes's investigation in the countryside.<br /><br />Author Terry Pratchett combines humor with keen social commentary in a powerful and compelling adventure. I found myself laughing out loud at a number of points in this story--Pratchett is the master of the clever twist, the unexpected use of humor to defuse a tense situation, and, of course, the pun (starting with Young Sam's affection for the book The World of Poo). There's a lot going on here, though, beyond simple humor. Pratchett hypothesizes a race of goblins who survive (more or less) at the boundaries of society, living in rags and stink, suffering from ill-health caused largely by a deficient diet, and generally regarded as lacking basic intelligence. To Vimes, if they can call for justice, they're entitled to police protection. Others don't see it this way--and are prepared to take legal action to stop Vimes's noble attempts.<br /><br />Although there's a lot of message in the story, Pratchett surrounds the message with a fast-paced adventure. Vimes finds himself confronting officious local nobles, suspicion from the goblins, smugglers, kidnappers, a raging flood, and a criminal who seems to have more lives than a cat. I suspect many of Pratchett's teen fans will read Snuff with plenty of chuckles and enjoy a good fantasy adventure. Adult readers will also find a thoughtful commentary on our own civilization buried not particularly deeply beneath the crossbow bolts and rusty armor.ety, living in rags and stink, suffering from ill-health caused largely by a deficient diet, and generally regarded as lacking basic intelligence.

B004CHURKA|5.0|I have purchased this Ring some months ago and spend a great deal of listening to it. Firstly the presentation is exellent, with good slip cases and a bonus CD containing the entire libretto (something that is totally lacking with other 'remastered' versions).<br />The EMI has done reasonable effords to remaster the original tapes. This was in the early 90's. Today it is said that this remastering is 'filterized' and out of date. I can assure you IT IS NOT! The sound is full and rich, and the singers sound just as natural, as they must have sounded when the recording was made. As stated in previous articles, I am (willingly or not) a valuebale resource on the field due to my profession as a musician who concertizes, records (NAXOS), and lives in an artistic enviroment. That includes a vast record collection of mostly (95%) historic recordings. As a last reminder, to possible listeners of this unique and incredible Ring: TAKE THIS EMI one! Not the ones 'remastered' in 24-26-29 whatever bits or latest 'balanced' remastering. It is all so UNTRUE. This EMI recording towers far above all those experiments. It is certainly a result of, permit me to say, EMI's long and deep record tradition and experience. It puts the others (like Gebhardt) into their still novice shoes; really. Thank you for reading my statement about this milstone recording of high artistry, including Furtwangler; his cast AND the RAI Orchestra. Yes; there are some flaws here and there, but isn't that in many 'modern' recordings too?? However nobody dares to say a word on that; digital is not perfect. ..Only the pure music, and artists like Furtwangler (and his cast and orchestra here) are inperfectly PERFECT in there approach and determination.
0143039881|5.0|I had long wanted to read Hannah Arendt's (1906 -- 1975) study of the Eichmann trial, \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil\\" and was prompted at last to do so when I found the book on sale at my local library.  As I read, the controversial nature of Arendt's book was brought home to me. I decided I needed to read Arendt in tandem with a recent study of the trial, \\"The Eichmann Trial\\" (2011) by historian Deborah Lipstadt. [[ASIN:0805242600 The Eichmann Trial (Jewish Encounters)]] Lipstadt devotes a lengthy chapter to analyzing Arendt's book. Lipstadt, perhaps with the passage of time, sees the trial and its significance differently than does Arendt. Her treatment of Arendt is critical but balanced.  She offers many of the criticisms of Arendt's book that were made when the book was published but finds a good deal to praise in Arendt's account.  Although Arendt's and Lipstadt's book take opposing positions in many respects, this is not at all unusual in serious historical study.  There is much to be learned from both books. They are better read, I believe, as complementary, rather than as opposed.  For all its flaws and datedness, Arendt's book remains tough minded, provocative, and deeply thoughtful.  Even for readers who disagree with Arendt or who become angry with her, the book is worth reading and pondering.<br /><br />Arendt was a political philosopher who received an extraordinary education in pre WW II Germany.  Her teachers included the philosophers Martin Heidegger (with whom she had an affair) and Karl Jaspers. Arendt immigrated to the United States in 1941 and soon became a famous public intellectual.<br /><br />On May  11,1960, Adolph Eichmann was captured by Israeli operatives in Argentina and brought back to Israel to stand trial for his activities in the Holocaust. The capture and kidnapping of Eichmann resulted in substantial international controversy as did the trial itself.  Eichmann's trial began in April, 1961, with the accused sitting in a bullet-proof glass both which became famous in itself. The trial was held before three distinguished Israeli Judges, each of whom had received their legal training in Germany.  The chief prosecutor was Israeli Attorney General Gideon Hausner. Eichmann was defended by counsel of his choice, Robert Servatius, who had also been a lawyer for Nurenberg defendants.  After a lengthy trial, in which Eichmann testified and was cross-examined in great detail, the court found Eichmann guilty and sentenced him to death in December, 1961. The Israeli Supreme Court rejected Eichmann's appeal on May 29, 1962; and Eichmann was hanged two days later on May 31, 1962.  Arendt covered the trial for \\"The New Yorker\\".  Critics point out that she was not present for the entire trial. Her book is based not only on observation of the trial but upon Arendt's reading of the transcripts, affidavits and other materials, including Eichmann extensive pretrial statements, that Israel's government made available to the media at the time as well as upon additional sources.<br /><br />With all the criticism the book received at the time, Arendt's account of the trial was careful. The book is difficult to read and, in spite of her protestations to the contrary, is as much a work of political philosophy as it is a journalistic account of a trial.  Arendt criticized the kidnapping of Eichmann and the manner in which prosecutor Hausner conducted the trial.  She praised the Israeli judges and their approach to the case. It is sometimes overlooked that Arendt found that the Israelis were in the right in kidnapping Eichmann and in trying him before an Israeli court.  Arendt found that Eichmann amply deserved the sentence of death, and she approved of the Israelis carrying the sentence out expeditiously in the face of widespread arguments for commutation.<br /><br />Among other things, Arendt is criticized for applying the term \\"banal\\" to Eichmann. He appeared to her and to others as a mediocrity interested in his own career and in carrying out his orders rather than as a rabid Nazi and anti-Semite. She emphasized as do many modern writers the pervasive character of evil in WW II Germany and the lack of resistance. Documents that were not available to Arendt suggest to some historians that she overstated Eichmann's \\"banality\\", and that he was a far more committed Nazi and vicious anti-Semite than she realized. Arendt was also criticized for emphasizing the lack of resistance of the Jewish victims and the alleged cooperation of the Jewish leaders with Eichmann in carrying out the transports to the camps. Her manner of presentation was thought to be insensitive and ahistorical. Arendt attempted, with some plausibility, to respond to these criticisms. I don't think Arendt was as insensitive or as mistaken as her strongest critics suggest. There is still, as Lipstadt acknowledges, a great deal of historical discussion about the means in which the Holocaust was carried out. Arendt's tone, however, was that of a detached academic, and it sometimes became provocative and unduly combatative.<br /><br />The main issues raised with Arendt's book seem to me her understanding of the purpose of the trial and her view of the nature of the Holocaust and of Eichmann's crimes. The prosecutor, Hausner, wanted to use the trial to educate the world further about the nature of the Holocaust. He put on the stand 100 witnesses, most of whom were Holocaust survivors. Many of these witnesses offered testimony that had little to do with Eichmann or that was unreliable. The Israeli court frequently grew impatient with Hausner and criticised his conduct of the trial, describing it as \\"picture painting.\\"  For Arendt, the trial was a legal proceeding that should have been focused on a single question, the actions of the accused and his guilt or innocence of the charges. She found overwhelming evidence to convict Eichmann.  In this, the Israeli court at the time agreed with her. Many more recent scholars, including Lipstadt praise Hausner's approach to the trial.<br /><br />Arendt saw Eichmann's guilt as a \\"crime against humanity\\" directed against the Jewish people against the background of a long history of anti-Semitism. Her approach tended towards universalism.  Lipstadt and Hausner, in contrast, see the Holocaust as the final and direct result of centuries of anti-Semitism and violence.  She, of course, does not deny the universal character of the Holocaust.  The different approaches are important but matters of emphasis.  It is here that I think that Arendt and Lipstadt may both be right.<br /><br />Arendt's book remains worth reading as a historical document and for the views, sometimes ingraciously expressed, about the nature of law, government, evil, and personal responsibility.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanrrying out his orders rather than as a rabid Nazi and anti-Semite.

0553801473|5.0|Despite the great job of Amazon delivering this item from USA to Peru in just one week (I didn't paid expedited shipping or anything). I must say that the cover of this book in simply amazing. I love touching it. I love the paper material, the color, the draws, the design. Everything. I didn't read the book yet, but is easy on the eyes, has a great price, is huge (so, more stories for my favorite characters, I hope.). George R.R. Martin are an insane genius. The book nearly a thousand pages of pure storyline, despite the houses background and resume. I love this guy and I hope more people join the universal net of fans who enjoy this incredible saga. Give it a chance. It's worth it. I guarantee that. And I know this book five is not going to be disappointing.

However, I had been using it for only about a month when it stopped functioning properly. It worked normally for about five uses, and then it stopped recording sound on one side - videos recorded using this microphone would only output sound through one speaker.<br /><br />Save your money and buy a higher-quality one.

0811879631|5.0|All you need to know is that this is a gorgeous book. Like other Art of... books published by Chronicle, this book showcases some beautiful and historic artwork.<br /><br />Amid Amidi is a well known animation journalist, historian and author. He is the co-founder of Cartoon Brew and has written several books covering animation. This is not his first Art Of... book (The Art of Pixar, The Art of Robots and Cartoon Modern) from Chronicle and I hope it won't be his last.<br /><br />\\"In an inspired spurt of a week or so, [Ralph Eggleston] painted the colorscript, a roadmap for the way the color (and thus emotion) would be applied throughout the film.\\"<br /><br />The idea of a color script might be a new concept to you (it was to me). It is a defining work or a canon on a film that shows the progression, changes and mood of the color as it relates to the stories and the characters. From what I understand, it goes hand-in-hand with the storyboard and might be created before the storyboard has begun. A few studios used the color script before Pixar, but not for every single film and short. Ralph Eggleston created the first color script for Toy Story and it captivated John Lasseter and Steve Jobs. It became a standard tool after that.<br /><br />Beyond presenting every color script that Pixar has created (at least the ones that were saved), the Art of Pixar shows how the artistry has evolved. It was very surprising to see how close the color script stayed to the final film as well as how different films changed over the course of production. Amid included the color scripts for the short films so you get a look at how the process differs for the shorts. With a company like Pixar, you would assume that all of color scripts would be computer-based art. Surprisingly,they were done with different media, including pastels.<br /><br />The second half of the book is dedicated to \\"Select Art from 25 Years of Pixar Animation.\\" There are over 100 pages of artwork sharing the creative process of the 12 feature films. This is closer to what we are used to with a typical Art of... book. The artwork shines and is an impressive look at how the films develop. Amid discusses that the artwork we see is part of the Pixar Living Archive that was created during the development of A Bug's Life. Pixar was shipping its art to the Animation Research Library when Pixar decided to keep its own artwork and create a \\"morgue\\" for their artists to use.<br /><br />With most art-related titles, it is sometimes easier and more effective to let the images speak for themselves. Many of these images would be welcome in any art gallery.<br /><br />The Art of Pixar is a welcome adition to the body of literature on Pixar. The color scripts offer fantastic insight into the development of the modern animated film. It is a part of the animation process that has not garnered a lot of attention previously. This is a gorgeous book that will leave you speechless at times when you realize how dazzling the artwork is and that more attention needs to be given to the art of animated films.what we are used to with a typical Art of... book.

B004UXUWYM|2.0|The Rum Diary was hugely anticipated on my part for quite some time now. As a fairly big fan of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, I was more than a little excited to see Johnny Depp jump into the shoes of Hunter S. Thompson once again. But there were a few snags along the way. For one, the film has been sitting on the shelf for over a year. We also didn't have any sort of trailer, TV spot, or even production images until a few months ago. We had a summary and a rather impressive looking cast to fall back on. Part of me knew this wouldn't be quite as gonzo or extreme as Fear and Loathing, but an even bigger part of me really wanted it to be. In the end, it just wasn't meant to be and The Rum Diary is just barely on the better side of decent.<br /><br />Hunter S. Thompson took on several different personas over the years in his writing. Regarding the film adaptations of his works, Raoul Duke, who Depp portrayed in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the man Paul Kemp, who Depp portrays in The Rum Diary, eventually becomes. So it's kind of obvious from the start that The Rum Diary won't be as erratic as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In 1960, Paul Kemp goes to Puerto Rico to write for The San Juan Star and meets Bob Salas (Michael Rispoli) the newspaper photographer and Edward J. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) the editor. In addition to Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi), who has pretty much drank away the majority of his life. While Kemp struggles to write a story Lotterman is happy with, he begins to pal around with Bob and eventually runs into Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a man who knows how to make money on an island that doesn't seem to have any. Kemp gets into a few business discussions with Sanderson and falls in love with Sanderson's girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard). Writing becomes the least of Kemp's problems as he struggles with an overbearing alcohol addiction, a domineering urge for lust, and the unfathomable ways he finds himself getting in over his head in nearly every situation.<br /><br />I feel like Johnny Depp has lost whatever it was that made him interesting years ago since I haven't particularly cared for one of his live-action films in years. Blinded by pirates and consistently working with a particular gothic director from Burbank, California, Depp has been stumbling around in mediocre territory for quite some time now. I was hoping he'd at least show shades of his performance in Fear and Loathing and I suppose he did. Paul Kemp was a man who's much more together than Raoul Duke was though. His mind isn't quite as polluted with mind-altering substances as Duke's was. Depp is obviously tapping into the same character and seems to do what he can with the role, but it isn't really a noteworthy performance. Giovanni Ribisi felt like he stood out much more, but that was more than likely the purpose. Moberg is the most interesting and laugh-out-loud character of the film. He's so far gone that a simple intoxicated hand gesture or head movement speaks volumes of his character. While The Rum Diary attempts to be its own film, the eyedropper scene is probably the closest you'll get to Fear and Loathing nostalgia.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie felt like it didn't really find its footing until its second half. Upon seeing Fear and Loathing, Thompson was quoted as saying that the film would have been nothing more than \\"a series of wild scenes\\" without Depp's narration. That's one of The Rum Diary's biggest problems. While we do hear the inner thoughts of Kemp while he's writing or while staring into a lobster tank, The Rum Diary feels like a hackneyed series of crazy events strung together. It could best be described as quirky or semi-eccentric up until the cock fights begin, but it feels rather ho-hum in its execution. Bob Salas looks, sounds, and acts like a watered down version of Dr. Gonzo. There are all of these wild and bizarre occurrences happening around every turn and about two dozen memorable one-liners being spewed like wildfire, but no performance really sticks out above the rest and you seem to be just along for the ride rather than being sucked into it. The Rum Diary almost comes off like a watered down version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.<br /><br />The Rum Diary is full of Johnny Depp breathing fire, voodoo, countless laws being broken, hangovers, riots, alcohol, and chicken, but it's all wrapped up in really dull packaging. There's some good writing in there; some that spoke to me as a writer. Its mundane line delivery is nearly forgotten about in its second half where things pick up and are borderline hilarious, but everything good going for the movie is forgotten about in its extremely disappointing ending. Considering all of its flaws, issues, and miscues, the logical side of me is wishing The Rum Diary would have stayed on the shelf.e really sticks out above the rest and you seem to be just along for the ride rather than being sucked into it.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|This show is probably my favorite show ever. Though the series starts off weak (one of the worst pilots I've ever seen), it slowly builds its way to an epic finale that will have you thanking the gods you stuck with it.<br /><br />The roles were cast to perfection and no matter which character comes into contact with another, chemistry abounds. Andy Whitfield (RIP) plays the title character. Whitfield has brought a new life to an old story by making him vulnerable, angry, determined, hot headed, and loyal. Bottom line: Whitfield has not only made Spartacus real in my mind, but also made him human and therefore relatble.<br /><br />The brilliancy of this show lies in the complex characters and their way of interacting with everything around them. Each has their own agenda, their own desires. This makes their separate storylines seem as though they are unrelated until that one special moment puts all the little pieces together.<br /><br />Everything about this show is made for watching: character driven plots, multiple villains clashing against each, multiple heroes clashing against each other; villains vs. heroes. There are funny, lighthearted moments that are just as important to the characters as the dramatic ones. Not one single line is wasted in this show.<br /><br />Everything and everyone has their purpose. The pacing allows the viewer to identify and relate to a character along with their situation.<br /><br />Overall, this show is nothing short of a masterpiece in storytelling, casting and development.
B005KMX866|4.0|From the first time you listen to a Chris Isaak CD, you know who his influences are. His sound, while unique, still has distinct predecessors and anybody who has listened to any music at all immediately knows what those are. This CD is his tribute to that sound.  Yes, some of it sounds just like the original, but if you can't improve on it, at least you can cover it faithfully.  You don't have to put on extra wailing (like any number of attempts at our national anthem in the last several years) in an attempt to be original. I have always liked this band and their stuff, and this CD is not just another Chris Isaak CD. It really, really is pleasant, and taps into a root sound that we shouldn't ever lose track of.  I have always thought Silvertone's best work was in their first four albums; this CD kind of brings me back in, at least a bit.

0465011047|4.0|Hwan's purpose in writing this book is to expose to the world the horrors of North Korea's gulags. Hwan spent ten years, from age nine to nineteen, as a political prisoner in the concentration camp Yodok, deep in the North Korean mountains. At Yodok Hwan and other prisoners like him were nearly starved, worked to death, and indoctrinated in the cult of the great leader, Kim Il-Sung. What did Hwan do to deserve all of this? He happened to be the grandson of a man who might have spoken out against North Korea's corrupt regime.<br /><br />Hwan's account of his life in the camp is undeniably horrifying. He draws connections between North Korea's camps and those of the Nazi and Stanlinist regimes. His memoir certainly offers insight into how such a corrupt dictatorship manages to sustain itself. In North Korea transgressors are not the only ones punished; their relatives are punished too.<br /><br />North Korea clearly thrives on secrecy, and shining a light on the dreadful human rights abuses perpetuated there is undeniably an important part of trying to end them. That said, this memoir is less literary and more political in outlook. It is sometimes less concerned with nuance, and more concerned with making a political point. Still, for those unfamiliar with how North Korea operates, this is important reading.

B0036S4CTS|4.0|WARNING- THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, so if you haven't yet read the book or seen the movie, don't read beyond this first paragraph.  This is a long, impressionistic review, prompted by discussions of the book with others, possibly of interest to those who've already read it.  This book has stuck with me, made me think much about relationships, both ill-fated and \\"meant to be.\\"  It raises myriad issues about love and life, I recommend it.  Note that text-to-speech is not enabled if you like to listen to kindle books.<br /><br />I haven't yet had a chance to read other reviews, so forgive redundancies.  I found the change in tense a little jarring at times.  And, it's an English book.  Though fairly familiar with the vernacular and culture, there were still lots of references I didn't have a clue about.  Most I could figure out from the context, but I don't know what Americans will think, how jarring they'll find it.  Another quibble: he telegraphed in neon about two pages ahead that someone was about to die.  It didn't prevent me from being affected when the moment arrived, but it would have been more powerful, affecting, had he not done this.<br /><br />I concluded that Emma was appealing to Dex because she was steady and honest, not exploitative or out to get anything from him, and accepting of him the way he was.  But WHY was she so accepting of him, and why did she find HIM so appealing?  Yes, she lacked self-confidence.  She does draw the line when he's at his worst, rejects him, but she still longs for him.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed was that Emma consistently broke it off with the people she was involved with, and left jobs despite being wanted, while Dex, on the other hand, was the one that got dumped by lovers, employers, basically everybody.  It seems too simple to say that it was just because he was a drunk.  I got the feeling I came to understand Emma's character better than Dex's.  Was he shallow?  Promiscuous?  Commitment phobic?  Self-destructive?  Yes, but was it that simple?  I often wonder what authors have in mind, e.g., slow and steady wins the race, vs. burning out quick, setting sights too high (whereas Emma initally set her sights too low)?  Maybe all of the above.  Then there were class issues.  And family issues.  Was he spoiled by his beautiful mother?  There were only hints on issues of class and family relationships.  I would've liked to have learned more.<br /><br />What I drew from the book is that sometimes people are drawn to each other, have a spark between them, for reasons no-one can quite figure out.  Leastwise I didn't see it, if it was there in the text.  They met at a magical, \\"starting off\\" point- life now begins, perhaps that imbued their brief early contact with added meaning.<br /><br />For the first few chapters I found myself rooting for them to get together, but that evolved into just wanting to see them each prevail, succeed, find happiness.  I often wonder how much you bring to a book, and how much is by the author's design.  But both characters' stories were involving, compelling.<br /><br />I loved the details about life, what happens while you're busy making other plans.  There were many keen insights, for example, regarding people's ambivalence about things, about each other.  Like Dex's love and wonder over his new daughter, yet annoyance, resentment at having to feed her, entertain her.  There were some hilarious, laugh-out-loud parts, like when Emma warns a valet about her car's \\"quirks.\\"<br /><br />I found the book absorbing and thought-provoking.  The author provided many insightful analyses of lousy relationships, contrasted with a few glimpses of relaxed bliss between Dex and Emma.  Would they have grown bored with each other?  Neither had a good track record on that score.  But we'll never know if they would've stayed together, lived happily ever after.  Damn.<br /><br />I don't know if the author intentionally inserted red herrings to ultimately surprise, or if he was saying \\"things seem one way, but they're actually another,\\" despite appearances, or both.  For example, there was little reason for him to go into the detail about Sylvie (spelling?) regretting having left Dex, resenting Emma, suggesting that they might reconcile later.  But that doesn't happen.<br /><br />Throughout the book there's this underlying theme, press, that they're meant to be together, the parents and friends think so, approve, seem to expect it, like it was destined to be.  Then it finally happens, but apparently it was NOT destined to be.  Unless the point was ultimately to make Dex become a better person.  Of course, perhaps there was no point, no destiny involved, just mistaken human attributions of such.  The author did a good job too of showing that people adapt to WHATEVER happens.<br /><br />I know it's trite, but I would've found it more satisfying if they'd either lived happily ever after, or better still, found that their longing for each other had been based on quicksand, petered out, and then one or both of them found TRUE love.  I would have liked it if Dex had reconciled with Sylvie, both of them now older and wiser and more appreciative of each other.<br /><br />This book communicated such strong feelings, for example, regret over missed opportunities.  They each kept wanting to call and make contact, kept thinking of each other, but allowed themselves to be distracted by other things, sidetracked by self-doubt in particular.  Then when they'd overcome the doubt and call anyway, they'd just miss the other one.  Of course the reader is privy to the thought processes of both, so we know they are each thinking of the other, but sadly, mostly out of sync.<br /><br />I was affected by the sense of urgency (spanning youth thru middle age), seeming powerlessness over circumstances, pessimism or hopelessness, futility, regret.  Life is full of such moments.  I thought the author captured the shock of aging well.  Was the ending satisfying?  I couldn't help but compare it to the wonderful British TV show as \\"As Time Goes By,\\" which I found more satisfying (sorry- knee-jerk longing for happy endings).<br /><br />Was the book memorable, thought-provoking? YES.  It will stick with me for a long time.  Definitely worth reading.<br /><br />UPDATE: I later saw the film, and while it had quite a few lousy reviews, and was unfavorably compared with the novel, this was one of the few cases in which I actually preferred the movie to the book.  I thought the movie retained the best bits of the book and actually improved upon it.r if he was saying \\"things seem one way, but they're actually another,\\" despite appearances, or both.

1451648537|4.0|A fascinating look at the life of Steve Jobs. Isaacson does not sugar coat the man, and this book is very honest in portraying both the positive and negative sides of Jobs. Given how controlling he was about his products and his personal life this is remarkable.  This is not just a book for Apple lovers or tech people. In showing the life of Jobs powerful lessons about creativity, leadership, innovation, design, and vision come forth.  By the end of the book you might not like Jobs more, but you will know more about a man who was one of the most influential people of our time.
B00336G7HI|3.0|Bought this for our trip to Rome this summer. This battery works fine but you only get 1.5 hours of use compared to 2.5 hours from the battery that came with the camera even though it is the exact same model number. I think it is really a NP-FV30 instead of a NP-FV50.
B004R739LE|4.0|I just bought my first DSLR, a Canon T3i.  I bought a smaller telephoto lens to go with it, but that was it for me as far as accessories.<br />For me, this backpack is great--it holds the small lens and my camera (with its stock lens) easily.  The camera part of the pack is small--and has velcro-attached separators that you can move around to adequately fit any DSLR camera and a smaller lens or two.<br />That said, it is NOT going to fit the larger, more expensive lenses.  It will not fit a tripod or any other accessories.  It is for light use when you are just carting your camera on a short hike or day trip, with no need for the larger lenses or equipment.<br />I ride a motorcycle, and this allows me to carry my camera along for the ride without having to worry about storing it in my saddlebag (with all of that vibration).<br />You can easily fit a lunch in the top of the pack, and maybe a long sleeved t-shirt.  If you store any drinks in there, be sure that they don't leak, so you can protect your camera, as the camera is stored on the lower half of the pack.  So be sure you don't toss it down onto a table or the ground.)<br /><br />I like the pack for the needs I have.  Once I upgrade to the larger lenses, though, it will not be adequate to store them with any protection.
B005G0YP3M|5.0|It's fabulous that, with today technologies, we can now hear tapes wich were recorded nearly 40 years ago with such accuracy !  This remaster version (from Alucard - 2011) is the best edition of Octopus we can reach and it will surely be impossible to do better after that...  The band recently retrieved the original master tapes from this album and the cd is rematered from these bands with supervision of Schulman bros.  Now we can listen to all intricate details of the recording.  I've noticed a broader spectrum on the bass, the sustain of the instrument is expanded,the separation of instrument is better.  Even if you already have owned previous CD of Octopus, don't hesitate to buy this one...  I totaly agree with WTDK's review  concerning sound considerations  The package is pleasing, a tri fold card board with booklet including quotes from the band members.  I've found that it's hard to extract the disc from the jewel center in the box, it is very tightly adjusted.  Then I've housed the disk in a separate protective sleeve.  There is a long and pleasing bonus track of Octopus excerpts 1976's live at the  end of the CD.  TOTALY RECOMMENDED !!!
0810989956|5.0|I purchased this item for my grandson that lives far from me.  I know that he has received it and I have been thanked, so the book must be o.k.  His mother did not indicate anything different.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|This is for sure an original story for those out there who think it is a Twilight ripoff that came out before Twilight. No Werewolves or Vampires here. It is more like a male version of The Craft. It's true all of these boys look like male models but Hollywood tends to do that with a movie whose target audience are teenagers and young adults. Regardless this is a good story with a good plot and worth the watch for any horror fan.
0553801473|4.0|After five years, GRR Martin finally decides to grace us with another book the same time HBO comes out with the TV show. As a fellow fan, I can't help but pick it up to figure out what happens to the story. But did anything really happen? That's an arguable point.<br /><br />Let's talk about the enjoyable things before getting to the more unpleasant parts of this review:<br />Martin is a great writer. No matter how slow the story is moving, I still didn't want to put the book down. Martin's writing really brings the world to life. His descriptions of cities and markets and people makes a vivid image in your mind. In the current fictions climate where descriptions are minimal, it is a refreshing change, but it could also be annoying to the readers who are used to \\"action action and action\\" books instead of a book that brings the world alive with vivid details.<br /><br />It is also hard to think of exceptionally good things about this book, just because this is mainly a book that pushes things along at a snail pace. As others have stated, things can happen much faster. There're just chapters and chapters and chapters of events that were useless. **Spoiler ahead: **For example, from the beginning to the end, war threatens Mereen, but does it actually happen? No.** With this long of a book, you'd think there would be more life-changing, well, at least more surprising twists around the corner. I'm not saying there arent, but there are just not enough for the length of this book.<br /><br />Martin does have a way to grip readers if only because I want to know what happens even though nothing happens chapter after chapter. After every page, for every chapter, I keep hoping something important will happen, but usually I am left with disappointment. Yet still I go on reading, because I do care. I still care about the characters, old and the new.<br /><br />Nothing much left to say. If you read the previous ones and is a fan, then it's a must read, if only to continue the series. If not, then you shouldn't be looking at this review. Read the first book and decide for yourself.
B005MJB0W6|3.0|The whole series is formulaic.  The writing is professional but never rises above workman quality.  The action sequences are predictable.  The bad guys always run and have to be run down on foot. There's always a car chase.  The cast is competent and undeniably \\"eye candy\\" material.  Scott Caan alone stands out for his acting and his ability to make Dan-O more than just a two dimensional character.  And yet, that having been said, the whole thing is fun.  Do I recommend it?  Yes, just know what you're getting.  Sometimes this is exactly what I want. I bought the whole first season and I'll probably buy the second season  too.  If you go with it, I hope you enjoy it.  Take off your thinking cap and just go with the flow.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|Nothing much to add except (with regards to the Blu-Ray version) it will be available at Best Buy on the 8th. Everyone else has to wait for December. The DVD will be available on November 8th on Amazon and everywhere else. Just got to bestbuy dot com and search for Time Machine 2011: Live In Cleveland  -  Blu-ray Disc  and it will show up.
B005CM9DX6|3.0|Gone is the juxtaposition between the heavy and the mellow. This album is flat out mellow with a mere few parts that rock (rock in a Rainbow-lite sort of way, not the old Opeth way).  No death growls, sublime drum parts. Kind of boring.  It's Opeth, so what they do, they do well, I just hope this isn't what they continue to do on future albums.  Is it more disappointing then the new Morbid Angel, no, however, it is by far the weakest Opeth album, and that makes the Devil cry!!!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I enjoyed this book - tremendously! I've read several of Sophie's books - and this is right up there with clever comedy - and endearing characters. I found myself laughing out loud a lot - and sharing the story line with my husband and friends... I read a review that this book would make a good movie. I agree.   Buy and anjoy without hesitation.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Over the years, movies like \\"Deliverance\\", \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", and \\"Wrong Turn\\" have turned the 'evil hillbilly' into a well recognized sub-genre of horror. But did anyone ever stop to think that maybe the evil hillbillies were victims? Maybe they were just fighting back against the evil city folk wreaking havoc in their front yards! \\"Tucker & Dale vs Evil\\" is a creative spin on this sub-genre of horror, similar to how \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Zombieland\\" portrayed a more comedic side of the zombie sub-genre. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine were fantastic as the good-intentioned and lovable Tucker and Dale, and the actors/actresses playing the college kids were easy to hate. Ultimately, if you want a good laugh, don't mind a moderate amount of gore, and enjoy some action and romance, this is the movie for you.
0393338959|4.0|A friend of mine, a well placed Wall St. insider, was lamenting in the thick of the financial crisis around 2008 that everyday they were finding a new \\"black swan\\"!  This very smart financial genius was completely blind to the fact that we were and still are facing a man-made disaster, that the house of cards elaborately built by the likes of him was doomed to come down and all this had little to do with unfortunate coincidences.  Stiglitz explains in detail but sometimes too repatedly how Wall St. and greed managed to get our finances into this mess, how both Bush and Obama governments, well stocked with Wall St. insiders, took actions that mostly protected the guilty and responsible at the expense of tax payers and more significantly the fallacy of talking about \\"free markets\\" when it comes to US financial markets and their in principle self-corrective and self-healing characteristics.
B001B6PBBK|3.0|Reasonable chick flick.  You see some of the same themes that you see in other similar movies.  Kind of painful to watch this if you are a guy and I am sure a lot of girls out there will enjoy it very much.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Fun movie! We had technical problems using it. Actually returned it once, but the second didn't work either. Contacted Sony about the problem and they emailed a solution. If your blu-ray won't play it, try contacting Sony online. They can fix it!
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|I bought this movie for my grandkids, ages 5 and 3.  They loved it!!  We are planning to take them on a train ride on the Polar Express in December so wanted them to see the movie first.  We all enjoyed the movie!  I love ordering from Amazon-great prices, free shipping, and fast delivery. Thanks!
B000002OX3|5.0|I will admit, it took me quite a few listens until I was able to fully appreciete This brilliant album. This is definatly  mid 60s sounding who (wich I dont have a problem with at all). The sound on this disk is superb! Tracks like so sad about us, whiskey man, and a quick one come crashing out of the speakers like a tidal wave. This album definatly has some filler, fortunatly there are enough great cuts on this cd to make up for them. I had purchased the whos magic bus cd before this one wich I feel was a mistake considering most of the songs from that album are on this cd as well. Essential for any who fan or fans of mid 60s pop rock.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|Now a sober man with a Hollywood wife, a Hollywood house and his own record label, Pax Am, Ryan Adams has released the first record of his second act, a mellow and warm singer/songwriter effort called Ashes & Fire. The two things you're bound to hear about this record - if you're the investigative type - is that: 1) The record is quite mellow and fells like something of a brother to Neil Young's Harvest and After the Goldrush; and 2) Adams has become, maybe above all else, an incredible vocalist.    In a 2001 interview, following the release of his make-or-break sophomore solo release, Gold, Adams spoke about his then-strict routine, where he forced himself to spend an hour each day working on songwriting, an hour each day practicing guitar and an hour or more each day singing. It was no surprise then that, following Gold, Adams became one of the most prolific - and consistent - songwriters of his generation, releasing 12 albums between his breakthrough release, 1997's Stranger's Almanac, and today's Ashes & Fire. All along it's been said that Adams was a heavy user, living out the mission set forth in his 2001 song \\"Firecracker,\\" where he sand \\"Everyone wants to go forever / I just want to burn up hard and bright.\\" Clearly, things have changed, and Ashes & Fire is the document.    What first took my attention was the look of the record. Adams, also a painter and novelist, had never struck me as a man with an overall aesthetic like, say, Thom Yorke or Jack White. That is, not one to speak too highly of. Mostly, Adams - for me that is - was a lousy painter and poet who could make great, great songs that sometimes had very good lyrics. Then came Ashes, a beautifully presented record that begs me to believe that, as a sober adult, the man has more tolerance of the things outside the recording studio. And while the beautiful presentation of the record does seem distantly symbolic in relation to Our Man's transition from punk to adult, the real star of the show, as it should be, are the 11 songs - a collection Adams himself has already called his \\"best yet.\\"    Opener \\"Dirty Rain,\\" a delicate and detailed composition heaped with 70s-era style turns, certainly starts things off right, working as an introduction to the artist's new era. In the song (or so we assume), Adams narrates from a third person perspective, juxtaposing his early 2000s rock star residency in L.A. with his modern - and much more settled - tenure in the town (he inhabited New York City in the interim). A beautiful opening that will resonate deeply with his longtime fans, putting to rest the inevitable \\"he was better when he was stoned\\" chatter in a classy, admirable manner.    Track two, the record's title track, is the most upbeat offering of the collection, feeling like something of a celebration of the man's abilities. He howls, strums and bangs in a way only he can. You'd be hard pressed to find a working rock musician with the ability to make a song as classic-sounding as \\"Ashes & Fire.\\" Maybe they can sing as good as Adams, or arrange songs just as good. Or they're a strong songwriter, sure. But a master of all three key elements, at once, on one song? Classic tracks like this are rare. Very rare. But far less rare for Adams than most.    If you've heard the above-mentioned Young records and are familiar with Adams' records like Gold, 29, Easy Tiger and Jacksonville City Nights, then you should have a pretty good idea of what Ashes & Fire sounds like. Overall the record is consistently mellow and most definitely thick and warm. There are instant classics like \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Lucky Now\\" and slow burners like \\"Invisible Riverside.\\" The writing isn't his most interesting to date but the singing soars like never before and the arrangements are heartbreakingly beautiful. Sure, I'd like to see the guy stomp his boots a little more here and there (he's one of the best ever at that), and I know he has more adventurous records up his sleeve. But if you're looking forfront-to-back listenability, it's hard to top this collection sweetly twangy, surprisingly uplifting tunes. The biggest difference here is that, for the first time ever, Adams has offered up a collection of songs that feel, for the most part, wholly positive. Hopeful. Tender. He rarely went there before (only \\"Dance All Night\\" and \\"So Alive\\" come to mind at the moment), to that positive place in his songwriting heart, but when he did, it was always damn good. Rest assured, Ashes & Fire, a new era Ryan Adams for sure, continues the streak, but with a new twist. His best since 2007's classic Easy Tiger.    97/100    Read more of my music- and film-related writing at [...]

B005IGVYUG|5.0|What more is there to say about Tom Waits now, 38 years and 17 studio albums after his 1973 debut, Closing Time? Of all the men I know of, the ones who have made me feel okay about the disgusting world, Tom stands tall, up there with complicated heroes like Ernest Hemingway, Charles Bukowski, Jim Jarmusch, Neil Young and Paul Westerberg. All damaged, gritty, wildly unique and creative men who found their way through alleys and backstreets, never taking the bait. Among them Waits, in my mind, maybe stands the tallest. Or maybe, I suppose, I'm just floating high on the buzz of Bad As Me, the man's first collection of brand new material since 2004's Real Gone and one of the best works of his storied career.    There comes a time in most artist's life, probably towards the end of when they expect themselves to be functional, where priorities and goals change. Having a legacy is no longer a joke, but a hard reality to stomach. Suddenly arrives a need to create something perfect - something signature. Maybe they've already done so in the past; doesn't matter, it has to happen again, before it's over. For Bob Dylan, it was 1997's tremendous Time Our of Mind and for Hemingway it was stack after stack of unpublished works, including \\"Islands In the Stream.\\" For Waits, it seems, it's Bad As Me, a bulletproof 13-song record that plays through almost like a best-of collection - a release just begging for that rare tag of \\"late era masterpiece.\\" And yes, Bad As Me is most definitely a masterpiece - the culmination of a career that sees a man looking back at his life, playing nostalgic and even bettering his younger self at times. When \\"Get Lost,\\" one of the record's many highlights, kicks in I can't help but want to race home and put on Down By Law, a cool-as-hell Jim Jarmusch film that starred a prime-era Waits as his most cool, most dangerous self.    Just when you thought all the anthems had been written, Waits offers up \\"Get Lost\\" and, even more notably, the record's title track, \\"Bad As Me.\\" The second \\"Bad\\" ended I, for once, turned to my listening pal and said something true: \\"Broken men will be quoting this song to broken women for decades to come, not for comfort but for relief.\\" And it's true: Waits has that rare, indefinable ability to put his thumb on the little corners of life.  \\"Talking At The Same Time,\\" another new classic, sees Waits exhausted, howling sad verses for a broken generation, summing things up nicely: \\"Everybody knows umbrellas cost more in the rain / And all the news is bad / Is there any other kind? / Everybody's talking at the same time.\\" Political? Yeah. Annoying? No. Timeless - yes! And that's the brilliance of Tom Waits. Oh, and there's this song called \\"Hell Broke Luce,\\" but I won't even go there, for lack of ink.    I could go on. I could go on and on and on. there's so much to love here. Bad As MeI is the document of a master, working at the height of his powers when you least expected him to do so. It's a creative, fully-baked album that just might go down as his most consistent, accessible and even masterful record to date. Who'd have thunk it? Tom Waits, at age 61, released the best record of 2011, and he made it look so easy.    100/100    Check out more of my music- and film-related writing at [...]

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Do I need to even write another review out of the thousands of glowing reviews?  Summaries can be found above and below I'm sure.<br /><br />This is a real page turner (or rather, Kindle button pushing), and you can't put it down once you get started!  I'm sorry that I started reading it right before I go to bed at midnight and ended up staying up until 5AM to finish the whole thing!<br /><br />Not only is it exceptionally well written with extraordinary descriptions and dialogue, but the plot is intriguing and intricate.  I think this is meant for young adults but definitely a little morbidly fascinating for adults as well.  I can't wait to start the next of the series!  Highly recommending to all my friends.  And a movie coming out in Spring 2012!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Got exactly what I wanted and more.  Seller upgraded my shipping for free (without me asking!) so I recieved movie LOADS faster than expected.  Since this is a Christmas gift I can only assume it plays well :) it is new so I can assume all is well with it. I will be shopping again with this seller!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I purchased this to go in my film collection. I only want important movies in my BluRay collection. If it's just a fun movie DVD will do just fine. But this movie not only looks unreal (so perfect but it doesn't look digital)but it has tons of \\"hidden\\" cartoons too. The skeleton dance, steamboat willie, Flowers and Trees...you may not recognize the names of them but I promise you will when you find them. Cannot recommend this any higher. A must for any collection.
B005BQTUVI|5.0|Terrific Blu-ray & DTS sound! Much better than the theatrical release. A great bargain that I found very entertaining. Highly recommended!
0307946711|1.0|I'm sorry but how this got to be so highly rated is just beyond me. I was looking for a laugh to take on holiday but this failed to raise even a smile. It might appeal to the people who find Hugh Grant irristable, but for me I much prefer the humor of the likes of Stephen Fry. David Luddington or Tom Sharp. This for me lacked any of those laugh out loud moments I look for in a humorous book

True, many of the problems are from composed problems, but I find these help with your working out the ones that are found on the board.    The bad news, is that this concentrates almost only on checkmates. there are a few endgame problems to work and learn, but little else. If one wants to learn other types of combinations, something like Livshit'z \\"Test your Chess IQ\\" would be better.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I recommend \\"Thor.\\" We enjoy comic book movies and this one is excellent. The door is wide open for a sequel and we look forward to a Thor 2 (or other title). Delivery of the movie was as promised so we were able to enjoy a great family movie night as planned.

B004LZRSBY|5.0|This A-HA bluray sounds great and looks awesome. They put on an excellent show for their farewell and it is an emotional send-off. This is A-ha at their best, they certainly ended on a high note.
1419702203|5.0|i really enjoyed the HBO documentary and this book continues and deleivers the goods on his remarkable career and interesting life.  the changes during his beatles day and post beatles day. his musical progressions and philosphys and changes he saw around and near him.  just very compelling and very gripping. you get inside the soul and a better understanding of his placing. he might have the quiet Beatle, however he was lively with the various trails his path took through the years. very mysterious and yet everything made sense and the more you follow his path it all adds up. a must read and very detailed.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|if you are a fan of great musicianship, as well as good old fashion blues with of course a contemporary twist thrown in the you will love this dvd, joe bonamassa is with out a doubt one of the elite guitarists playing today, this dvd is just s shinning example of just what exactly he brings to the table
B004I8WD7S|5.0|The case is excellent. I struggled with putting on the screen protector and finally abandoned it, but no regrets, as I am not sure if it's a big deal anyway.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|The performance of Joe Bonamassa at Royal Albert Hall on May 4th 2009 will go down as one of the most amazing musical performance ever.  This was the accumulation of over 20 years of hard work that he has put into his craft.  You will not find a finer execution of not only guitar skills, technique, and overall talent but also the very production of the film itself is second to none.  If you are even the slightest fan of blues and rock, you must buy this ASAP.

B005H0IW6W|4.0|I was one of the many who fell in love with Buble's Let It Snow EP from a few years ago, so naturally I was excited to hear this new full-length holiday album. As it turns out, it's every bit as wonderful as I hoped it would be! Michael's gloriously smooth voice not only meshes flawlessly with the jazzy productions of old classics like \\"Ave Maria\\" and \\"It's Beginning..\\" and \\"Have Yourself...\\" but also for renditions of pop tracks like \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\" and \\"Feliz Navidad.\\"<br /><br />Here's my list of favorites:<br /><br />- It's Beginning to Look A Lot Like Christmas. Buble makes you heart melt with this one. It's sweeping and romantic and relaxing, everything you want from a Christmas song.<br /><br />- Holly Jolly Christmas. Nobody does it like Burl Ives, but this is an extraordinarily refreshing take that works wonderfully.<br /><br />- White Christmas. A curious slap-bass type production gives this rendition a bouncy, fun feel. It's also great to hear Shania again, and I think her voice sounds lovely!<br /><br />- I'll Be Home for Christmas. Sinatra couldn't have done it better. So buttery!<br /><br />- Santa Claus is Coming to Town. A big band extravaganza that will liven up any holiday event!<br /><br />- Jingle Bells. Another hit to jazz things up!<br /><br />As far as the other tracks go, none of them are awful, just less mention-worthy.  Michael takes on a lot of classics traditionally sung by female artists, such as \\"Santa Baby\\" \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\" and \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" and, surprisingly, even those work fairly well. Santa Baby is probably the weakest, due to some awkward male-ifying of the lyrics, but still cute for Buble fans. \\"Silent Night\\" is a beauty, but turns a little cheesy when the children's choir joins in. Something about the \\"Feliz Navidad\\" duet doesn't sound right. I don't know if it's a lack of harmony or what, but it's definitely not going to top the original.<br /><br />Good and bad together, this is still easily a 4/5 star Christmas album. 4.5/5 is probably even a better rating. I am a little disappointed \\"Let It Snow\\" wasn't thrown in, since his old ep seems to be out of print now. But it's all good.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!!/5 is probably even a better rating. I am a little disappointed \\"Let It Snow\\" wasn't thrown in, since his old ep seems to be out of print now. But it's all good.  Merry Christmas!!
B004EPZ084|4.0|The cast is what saves this movie - Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis do a great job as three friends, all average joes abused by their bosses to the point where they've decided to kill them. Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell are all hilarious as the horrible bosses they want to rid themselves of (great to see Jennifer Aniston NOT playing a good girl.) Jamie Foxx has a great turn as a contract killer/consultant they try to hire. With a cast like that, how bad could it be?<br /><br />There are some slow moments, and some jokes that miss. It's definitely R-rated humor, and much of it is pretty low-brow, so if that is not your thing, you probably won't like it. But if you can deal with that, and sit through the slow parts, this has 4-stars worth of laughs...
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Edit: now that this game no longer crashes on my what is now my wifes S2 and works on my S3 as well I'm mostly happy.  Would be happier and would gladly pay for more levels though.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|This collection brings back memories of the first timeI heard them on Ed Sullivan at the age of eleven.  The albums that I have of them are almost unplayable but the new cd's are wonderful.  George Harrison was my first crush.  This is a gift for any music lover.  I<br />cannot believe how they sound like the originals but only better.  I hope they do this with the Stones and the Grateful Dead.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This sexy thing is what i have always wished to own! its the best for making your custom keys for any FPS game!   Very comfy which will help your fingers and easy custom edit key settings that rock any controller!  A must have for all of you MMO's!  ESSENTIAL FOR YOU FPS gamers!  A must get! You can do sooo much with it you can even think its overkill.. but that's what its all about OVERCLOCKING everything :P  (I recommend it to any true pc gamer, save up and get the G19 and G700 to complete your gaming controller gear!)
B004LROUNG|4.0|This was a nice, long, well though out book.  Like most well-known veteran authors, Grisham is tired of his formulative straight forward legal stories.  At this time, veteran authors start injecting variable doses of humor into the stories. Here, it works, but a great book this is not.
B003FOFJAY|4.0|I started watching this show when it first aired and for some reason strayed away after season 3.  I just purchased all of the seasons I missed and I must say that I missed a lot!<br /><br />I agree with all other reviewers who said that this was one of the most unique, diaglogue rich, character driven dramedies to come along in a long while.  It lasted for seven seasons because of the stellar writing and the talent laden cast filled with rising stars and veterans. Melissa McCarthy is a comedic dynamo and she and Lauren Graham have fabulous comedic chemistry. Yanic Truesdale's deadpan deliveries are genius when paired with either or both.<br /><br />I applaud Amy Sherman-Palladino for her brave decision to take Rory's character on a totally unexpected detour and let us all watch her find her way back, learn from her mistakes and mature in the process. Life's lessons 101...much more realistic and it made for good drama!<br /><br />Alexis Bledel is a fantastic young actress and I was in tears when she went to her Grandpa and burst into tears sobbing \\"Everything's falling apart...I've messed everything up and I don't know what to do!\\".<br /><br />Oh, the irony that Jess was the only one who could penetrate her \\"drop-out stupor\\", and get her  moving in the right direction again.<br /><br />In my opinion, Logan's character was the perfect college love interest for Rory.  He challenged her and brought her out of her shell and she met his challenges head-on and calmed him down. Logan was like a combination of Dean and Jess, He had a sweet, protective and chivalrous side, like Dean(but with a future); and a well read bad-boy side, like Jess(but with a trust fund). We saw his character mature beyond the spoiled, dare-devil-party boy we first met, with some bumps along the way, which he rebounded from also. It seemed that their story was in no way finished. That would be the perfect basis for a movie, if there was one. :)<br /><br />I've always loved the snappy dialogue and I totally get many of the pop culture references sprinkled throughout this series. The entire series is a testament to life as a modern woman.ed throughout this series. The entire series is a testament to life as a modern woman.

0393338827|4.0|Most of the comments that have already been placed here describe the book pretty accurate. It was the first book I've ever read by Michael Lewis and I'm impressed. Most authors of books on trading or the financial world are not as talented in writing a book the way he is. I finished reading this book before I knew it and found myself at times reading some sentences amazed and other times pretty amused.<br /><br />This was the third book I've read on the financial crisis of 2008 and it was almost completely new to me. He focuses on some main characters in this book and tells their stories.  Each character is pretty unique and colorful (especially Steve Eisman, Michael Burry and Howie Hubler). Most of these guys find out about the same shorting opportunity in CDO contracts.<br />Unlike most might think, this trade didn't start off that easily.<br /><br />Another surprise of this book is the level of depth the author goes to explain what CDO contracts actually are and how they're constructed and the various levels of risk they contain. What I found most surprising in this book is the level of CDS contracts AIG kept selling to various counterparties (Goldman Sachs in particular).  One might  wonder if these guys had any risk management or internal control system to limit the risk.<br /><br />In conclusion: highly recommend book.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|Works great!  Cover fits tight and snug on my wife's white iPhone 4s!  I usually don't like silicone covers becasue they seem to be to \\"sticky\\" and catch lint and are hard to pull out of pockets.  This one seems to be perfect.  Not to \\"sticky\\"  I liked so much, I am ordering the black one for my iPhone.
1594744769|4.0|In some ways, I'm surprised I liked this as much as I did.  I'm not sure why, maybe it's because I love the title/cover combo, or because I love the idea behind it, or because quirky can sometimes go horribly, horribly wrong; whatever the reason, I was kind of bracing to be let down in this one.  And since it reads a little dispassionately in the beginning, I had a hard time staying engaged and thought my doom-and-gloom expectations were going to be - well, satisfied doens't seem like the right word...<br />But I thought I was going to be disappointed, and I wasn't. (yay!)<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is intensely creative and unique, consistently giving me things I wasn't expecting.  This is not to say I didn't have issues with the book, because I did.  Though I love the idea of using quirky, odd photos to help narrate the story, there were certainly times when those photos seemed more forced on the story than supplemental to it.  There were times, too, where it just felt so damned over-written. I just wanted to say, 'Pull back a little, buddy.  One metaphor is fine.'  And as I said, it sometimes felt a little dispassionate.  But neither of these was a consistent problem, and the times when the book or the tone was nailed far outweighed the times when they were not.<br /><br />I think this is one of those books that you should know going in whether you are going to like it.  If you know that you like things a little quirky, a little dark, a little macabre and a whole lot strange, then yes, you are going to enjoy this.  If you don't, you probably won't.  The characters the reader is introduced to certainly live up to their moniker of peculiar.  Some are just mildly shocking ala a circus freak show, and some are downright unsettling (I'm talking about you, boy who makes little clay golems, then brings them to life with mouse hearts and makes them fight each other)...  There's a creepy \\"off\\" tone to a lot of what goes on, and the threat of violence and being, you know, hunted down and eaten, so yeah, it's a good Halloween read for sure. ;P<br /><br />What I loved, though, was getting things I didn't expect.  It's rare for a book to surprise me, and this one did so pretty consistently.  There were some great lines and bits of unexpected description that just tickled me and had me pulling out my post-its tabs*.  And there were characters and relationships among them that I did not see coming, and aspects of the villains that I didn't see coming (and I am rarely surprised or pleased by a villain).  Most of all, though, I was surprised by the whole plot and who it all works together. Beyond the expected elements of horror and mystery, there is romance and history and - something I can't get into it without being very spoilery - there was a crucial element to the plot, hinging on an ability of the titular Miss Peregrine, that I just did not see coming.  And I loved it.<br /><br />And I sort of feel like that's all I can say without starting to give some major things away.  As most people know now, there will be a second book (which, though it could be read and work as a stand-alone, I think a 2nd book was a bit of a given), and there will be a movie. And this I am very eager for, as I kept picturing scenes while I was reading.  It's very visual and some elements of the setting I just cannot wait to see onscreen.  There is a sense of wonder that I hope they can catch and even expand on.<br /><br />Oh, and I love the design of the book.  I know it's silly, but it gets points.  Almost everything about the design is just a little tiny bit different than other books, showing that thought went in to nearly every aspect of it, from the very squared-off binding to the end papers and chapter-pages, etc.  It's nice, that level of thought and attention to detail. I approve.<br /><br />*\\"But beyond all that, above the houses and fields and sheep doddering around like puffs of cotton candy, I could see tongues of dense fog licking over the ridge in the distance, where this world ended and the next one began, cold, damp, and sunless.\\"<br />Though a bit overwritten, I just adored the image of the 'sheep doddering around like puffs of cotton candy.'  ;)d and the next one began, cold, damp, and sunless.\\"  Though a bit overwritten, I just adored the image of the 'sheep doddering around like puffs of cotton candy.'  ;)
B000KITQK2|5.0|I now have 2 of these units and have happily used them with a variety of musical instruments, from guitars to drum machine to autoharp (with magnetic pickup). It is particularly good with the autoharp where its warmth an bass enhancement give the instrument a powerful organ-like vibe.<br /><br />I don't think there is anything out there that remotely comes close at this price. Compare it to the  K&K Pure Preamp for twice the price with half the features and which looks like somebody just knocked it together in their basement.  The Behringer on the other hand looks great and is loaded with features.<br /><br />The thing is both good looking and functional. It is one of Behringer's most impressive products and dirt cheap too.
B0013AYT4E|5.0|What can one say?  Heifetz enters the concerto like a frozen laser beam and continues to weave what feels like the most inspired performance of any violin concerto by any violinist.  No one has ever conveyed the frozen darkness of Valhalla and romanticism of Finnish mythology with such certitude and precision. Soloist and orchestra, everything comes together. A perfect storm.   The Prokofiev and Glazunov pieces just don't do it for me, but that's me/
0307593312|5.0|Really enjoyed the read. Went through it quite fast. With multiple references to other literary novels, this one will be a great re-read in the days to come.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I haven't had any kind of issues. I can view and change documents on the go. and my favorite part is being able to send it out to people. something other applications can't do. I have a G2X

0385535139|5.0|After being forced to read boring books for college, I picked this up to relax and enjoy. From the first chapter, Grisham pulls you in and keeps you reading. It took me less than 24 hours to get through this book, as I just wasn't able to stop reading. Loaded with twists and turns, these terrible lawyers make one heck of a plot. This book has only been out for six days, but I already can't wait for his next.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|This is a Great CD. Who would have ever thought that Dr. House was so talented. Surely not I. I am a 35 year veteran music teacher. I love this CD. A great addition to my collection.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I love the show and can watch it over and over.  Fall means Twin Peaks viewing in my side of the world.  The extras are great, every episode is here, the sound and picture are excellent.  And it has the once-hard-to-find pilot.  Love it!  My coffee maker and I have been very happy.
B0057VY45O|4.0|Dealing with Attorneys all day long i found Suits to be highly  creative, amusing,witty.,positively charming..It takes a non-plausible idea(getting hired at a firm..when one actually hasnt attended Harvard) and puts a whimsical spin on it.. Making an otherwise \\"toothly profession\\".. palatable!.. Very seductive as well!  Thoroughly enjoyed!!  RLS
B0028R3NCU|1.0|This reader just doesn't work.  It starts reading a micro SD and crashes, every time.  Cool looking, minimalist gadget, but it is essentially useless.  It was inexpensive, so I didn't bother going through the return process... otherwise...
B005LY4B0A|3.0|Great concept! Fun game. However, on the PD Novel (white) some of the bugs are missing, I only see white squares.
B004HNTER6|5.0|I don't particularly like Formula One yet was gripped by this documentary which is just as much about probing the psychology of Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna as it is about his championship winning drives. The family cooperated with the film maker so we see plenty of valuable early home footage of the young go kart driver who gradually works his way up through the racing world and then starts winning races. He slowly became involved in an ever nastier rivalry with the cool professorial Alain Prost of France, who was a very different and much more reserved man. Senna looks more and more stressed as the years go by and despite three championship titles, he changes teams when it appears he has a better chance of winning elsewhere. But the rules change and the car he thought would bring more victories turns out to be highly unpredictable. He is visibly broken up when a young driver is killed during practice for the Italian grand prix in 1994 and yet decides to take part in the race proper the next day.  The end of the film is so tense you can barely look at the screen. You know Senna is about to be killed in a crash and it takes a few seconds for it to sink in that you are looking at the video from his car and seeing what he saw. Senna takes bend after bend and accelerates into the straits and you know he will be dead in just a few seconds. Suddenly the car seems to slip out of control and then there is the shuddering impact and the screen goes black. I don't think I breathed much that last minute. The documentary is also good at highlighting Senna's importance to the morale of people in Brazil, who otherwise were having a very tough time.  Highly recommended.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|It's nice to have a way to work with files when you don't have your USB cable handy. This app does a nice job.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Video and sound excellent on this DVD. It is the BeeGees at their best and all seem to be having fun. They shortened up some songs but with a catalog as large as theirs ...did the best to touch all the hits and then some.  This is a must have for everyone's collection of the BeeGees!!!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Fun app that lets you see all the invisible stuff going on around you. I like the signal strength view.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Firefly is a one of my favorite tv shows just wish it had lasted longer. If you love the show you need to check out the movie Serenity, just make sure you watch all the episodes before the movies otherwise you will not understand everything. Only downside to this show is that it was canceled which really sucks. Like i said I love it and if you need to watch it!!!
B004XNGKBS|3.0|Played with it a little, seems ok but nothing earth-shattering. So I moved on to other apps. Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty.

B004UID2LC|3.0|I haven't used it much but the app seems to do what it's suppose to do.   I think it is silly that reviews must be 20 words minimum. My simple sentence above is all I had to say about this app.
B005J4TLN4|3.0|As quirky a horror movie you're gonna find, it has blood & mayhem, laughs and gasps.<br />Nick Frost(Shaun of the Dead) is brilliant, you can definitely see the influence of the Edger Wright movies in here, (Wright was also a producer)...there's also a scene reminiscent of the first Die Hard movie...it's a kicker.<br /><br />Kids with weapons on bikes and scooters, aliens who look like they walked out of a Tom Baker episode of Dr.Who, the anti-hero, Moses and a load of dangerous and funny blokes.<br />Not the funniest movie out there, but it is full of dark humour,if you like(d) Edger Wright's movies, you'll enjoy this movie
B004JZBGWI|2.0|It works OK but the interface needs some work. Creating new notes is confusing. I'm on the lookout for a better app.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|This movie was aweful. Not even close to funny. Cameron Diaz was disappointing and her character was a hot mess. I had high hopes because the trailer was hilarious - the movie was not.

0385534639|5.0|I would highly recommend this book. I usually don't enjoy reading a lot of descriptions and detail in books and usually head to where the dialogue is. This book was the exception. The descriptions were so amazing and magical. I had a vivid idea of what she was describing. I loved the ending and all through the book, I was wondering when does the movie come out and how are they going to achieve what she has described? It should be amazing if they do a movie.
B004SBX112|1.0|Program crashed, parts of the graphics were missing. I am very disappointed that this game won't run on my Pandigital Novel.
0345457692|5.0|Very creative, very unpredictable. Frequent small details on future life that stop you cold to say 'what a marvelous idea' or sometimes 'what a terrible idea' but believable. The ending is strange and realistic. I have to say this book is one you can re-read. I've been reading sci-fi for over 50 years and I really am impressed by this one.
B000002VSN|4.0|Whitney sings gospel, alright.  How not to admit that this great voice suits perfectly for a gospel album.  The problem, in this soundtrack, is that not everything has musical quality: some songs are pretty commercial.  You must content to find one or two good songs among the whole cd tracks... but that's ok.  However, we must remember this one as the last very good album by the great Whitney.
B00511ONPG|5.0|As any social marketer would tell you, there is a huge difference between being able to use a social media site, and being able to use a social media site to build and maintain a healthy, growing community. In my own experience, I have come across a significant amount of materials out there that will tell you all about the many features the various social media sites have to offer, but very few of those go on to provide any real instruction on the topic of how to actually use those features to build a community, much less a \\"likeable\\" one.  Dave Kerpen, CEO of Likeable Media does a fantastic job in his book, Likeable Social Media, of bridging the gap between text-book knowledge and the real-life human element that absolutely necessary for any success to be had in the real of social media marketing. Simply put, Dave makes it very easy to understand how to not act like a robot in your online communications and how to turn your brand into a living, breathing, community that your customers and clients are more than happy to be a part of.

B0041KKYGU|3.0|There are quite a few reviews up before mine so I'll try not to be repetitive. First off, you should know that, unlike most films released in an \\"unrated\\" format (usually meaning more sex and language), the \\"unrated\\" DVD of \\"Bad Teacher\\" contains BOTH the Theatrical Version and the \\"unrated\\" version. I did not see the film in the theater and have not watched the \\"theatrical version\\" here, but the unrated version contains nudity (only topless females - as the main character wants to get a \\"boob job\\") and lots of four- (and more) letter words. Even the image on the cover lets you know that the comedy is trying to \\"push the button\\".<br /><br />The story gets serious (well, sort of) in the second half but all the characters are played as broad comedy (no, there is no pun intended here) and so none of it can be taken serious. For those looking for a nude (or partially nude) Cameron Diaz, don't look here. She wears a \\"Daisy Dukes\\" skimpy outfit in one scene (which even gets its own 3 ½ minute featurette!) but that's it. Most of the \\"shock\\" is in the language. (Think Terry Zwigoff's \\"Bad Santa\\").<br /><br />The bonuses are a bit skimpy with 4 \\"blooper\\" scenes (4 min.), six \\"deleted scenes\\" (3 ½ min.), and a really dumb \\"Behind The Scenes with Jason (Segel) and Justin (Timberlake)\\" (5 ½ min).<br /><br />If you like films like \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" you'll probably like this. It's in the same vein; but not as good. For me, I'll watch FTARH again instead.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|Has a nice David Axelrod flavor to it, featuring funky grooves, a lush orchestra and fine vocal performances from Norah Jones and Jack White. If you find yourself liking this album, but don't know who the 1960s/1970s artist David Axelrod is, look him up.
B005D643PO|5.0|I was really glad to see Dexter kind of expand a little this season. I have watched all the previous seasons and this was one of my faves.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I can't believe how much fun this game is!  I don't buy many apps, but I did buy this one before it was the free app of the day. It's a really fun and addictive game.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|The movie is one thing but the digital copy is a joke.  Flixster / Ultraviolet is horrible!!!  Can't download the movie, can't upload it to the computer and their tech sucks!  Still waiting to hear back.  WB really dropped the ball on this one!

B005NFVZTM|5.0|Surprise, surprise.  This movie was fun to watch,suspenseful, and action packed! ACTION PACKED! I enjoyed it just as much as my thirteen year-old daughter.  There was only one mildly inappropriate scene.    The writers obviously took the time to carefully develop the characters. Because of the thoughtful character development, the audience can easily identify with, and root for, most of the characters. Both the protagonist and antagonist were compelling so I couldn't decide who to root for. So, I rooted them both on.    Enjoy!

0316098515|5.0|This is actually the first review I have ever written here. I have a literal library of cook books and baking books. I just found this book so inspiring, that I wanted to share my new found love for it. I bought this book not really knowing what I was going to get, but I am so glad I ended up buying it. All the photography is so stunning and the plating is just artful. However, this is not a cook book for the average \\"Joe.\\" Each dish has a multiple of components that go on each plate and some have components that have to be made in order to use it as an ingredient for another part of the dish. I love that the book is separated by season, and each season has a recipe progression makes you feel like you are sitting down, eating a meal at Eleven Madison Park. That is, you start with recipes from appetizers, entrees, then desserts. Bottom line, if you have some cooking experience,  the patience, time, and money (as many of the ingredients are very luxurious), these recipes can definitely done by the home cook. However, if you lack the skills, I would still get the book if only to see the amazing food they make, and mostly to give you inspiration in your own cooking adventure.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The multi-award winning Breaking Bad has recently concluded it's fourth season with a final and fifth season being officially announced, and having finished the 13 ep block in a viewing marathon over the last 4 days, I have to say it holds onto it's title as one of the THE best dramas on TV, period.  Season 1 starts off a little slow introducing our main character, Walter White, but then the story takes off with a literal BANG (you know the episode) and viewers find themselves suddenly on a nonstop roller coaster ride thru seasons 2 and 3 with ever increasing pace and tension.  Backed up by one of the strongest supporting casts with hardly a weak link between them, Bryan Cranston once again gives a tour de force performance as Mr White.  We see his gradual transformation from a Ned Flanders-like wimp to a hardened, rage-filled villain that would do Machievelli proud throughout the last 3 seasons, but things come to an explosive (pun intended) conclusion with the wrap of season 4.  Now this is the way to portray a 'good man's descent into villainy' story.  Yeah lookin at YOU Darth Vader & George Lucas.  In addition to Cranston's 3-time Emmy winning performance, other standouts include Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, brillaint character actor Jonathan Banks and Bob Odenkirk constant scene-stealer as Saul Goodman.  This rich cast of supporting characters give life to the well written story that constantly ramps the feeling of tension, danger and dread as we see Walt continue to spiral in a direction that will lead to an inevitable end.    If you haven't started watching this series and enjoy crime drams like the Sopranos, Wire, The Shield, then this is a much watch.  It easily matches if not exceeds all of these shows and has earned a permanent place in TV history.
B000056JYC|5.0|Great album, really one of the great live albums of all time.  Yes, the mouthpiece distorter on the guitar was done to death in the subsequent decades, but at the time of this concert it was still new and fresh and done by the best.

B000002HPT|4.0|As I go through the Dream Theater discography, backwards, I couldn't wait to review this gem.  Mostly, because I know it's one of those, I guess you could say contested, probably not the right word, albums.  A lot of people hate this album.  I guess I can sort of get not liking it as much as Images, or Awake, or Scenes.  There are some different stylistic changes, and I'll be honest, I prefer the other mentioned albums and their styles to this.  The sound of it is a bit too toned down, and it does have, sort of, a sell out feel to it, kind of like Octavarium in a way, except this album's way better.  The solos aren't as impressive, hence the sell out feel, and there are too many mellow tracks, same on most of their albums actually.  James's vocals aren't quite as impressive as in the previously mentioned albums, and that's pretty much all the negativity I have to say.  The album is still played very well.  James still sounds good, if not a bit different.  Also the songwriting is still pretty solid, maybe not as good as the previous 2 or the next album, but still solid none the less.  I think  one of the joys of this album for me is not only is it a good album, but knowing it's one of those some fans don't like, kind of makes me like it more, kind of like Queensryche's hear in the now Frontier.  These 2 albums, oddly enough came out the same year, sound nothing alike, but a lot of Queensryche fans hate that album too, whereas I enjoy it.  Also there are a lot more straight forward songs on this one, which is a nice change of pace from the overblown instrumentals of Six Degrees or Train Of Thought.  I should also add I got this one before Scenes had even come out, and before Awake, I think Images and words was the only other album I had by them, so to me this is a classic.  New Millennium 7/10 starts with a strange keyboard intro, before moving into a fairly long 2 minute, instrumental intro.  This song's kind of mellow, as is the whole album, but it has its heavier parts.  Overall though I don't love this one.  It's decent, and I listen to it whenever I listen to the album.  It's a fairly good song, but one of the weakest moments on the album.  The chorus is actually ok, but not to big on the part right after the first chorus, bunch of vocal samples and random noises.  Overall this song feels unfinished, like they needed to develop it a little more.  You Not Me 9/10 another mellower song.  This one's pretty straight forward.  My only real complaint is that the solo isn't very good, but otherwise this is a very good song.  Good melodies, nice beat.  Love the chorus and the build up to the chorus.  Peruvian Skies 8/10 overall one of the more ambitious pieces on here.  this one's primarily acoustic guitar driven, with drums and vocals, bass keys etc.  The chorus is a little weak, but serves its purpose just fine.  Where this song really takes off is in its instrumental break.  Also I can hear a bit of a Metallica influence in this song, the opening notes remind me of enter sandman.  Hollow Years 8/10 is another acoustic song.  Thankfully we got a high energy instrumental and outro to the previous song, cause we're back to slowness.  Still I really like this song.  It definitely took me a little while to grow on me.  There's what sounds kind of like a Spanish guitar in there as well, it probably isn't but it sounds like that to me.  Love the vocals in this one.  Given that this is such a ballad, heck probably the best ballad of 97, feel free to suggest others, I wish this song had given them some more attention, but sadly it didn't.  But then if it did, the success might have gone to their heads, and we might not have gotten the gem that is Scenes, or even Six Degrees, or the good songs from the remaining albums.  Queensryche anyone..  they fell pretty hard and fast after their most commercial successful album, granted their next 2 were decent, but after that...  Well..  Burning My Soul 9/10 finally we get a heavier song.  There'sa nice build up to the opening riff, for this upper mid tempo song.  James sounds pissed on this one.  Nice melodies, and nice angst, something we don't get much of from Dream theater.  It really fits the mood of the song.  1 of my 3 favorite songs on the album.  Lines In The Sand 10/10 is a long one, but Dream Theater fans are use to long songs, and this is a good one.  This, in parts is probably one of the faster songs on here.  Still it's epic.  Very theatric, no pun intended, opening, not counting the instrumental track that leads into it.  Excellent work by the musicians and James, and the guy from King's X who guests on this one, do great jobs on this song.  Love the, sort of opening riff.  comes about 2 minutes into the song, very catchy.  Love the drums, Portny can't sing worth a crap, see later album reviews, but he can sure play the drums.  This is probably the song for even the most stubborn fan who wants to hate on this album.  Seriously you can't deny the greatness of this song.  There are some truly jaw dropping, both vocally and instrumentally, in the breaks and bridges of the song.  The chorus is fantastic, and as I'm writing this I'm considering changing my rating of it and ranking this my favorite song on here.  Truly epic.  Did I say that already?  Take Away My Pain 8/10 really has a daunting task, following that stellar song, and it does its best.  This is overall a very good ballad, like it a little more than Hollow Years, which contradicts part of what I had to say about that song being the best ballad of 97, but whatever.  Both are good songs.  Love the chorus, nice guitar work.  The drums are nice too.  Overall just a good song.  Just Let Me Breathe 8/10 the last of the heavier songs, not many of them to begin with, and probably the fastest song on the album.  Overall it's a decent song, just doesn't quite measure up to the rest of the songs that come before it, better than the songs that come after though.  Anna Lee 7/10 Eh here's where theystart to lose me a little.  The piano is nice, but the pick scraping the guitar strings?  Really?  Staind did that one one of their crappy ballads from like 2000 or 01, can't remember.  This is when you hear the pick hitting the strings more so than the actual notes on the guitar, and I'm REALLY not fond of it in either song.  Still James is a hell of a lot better singer than Arron from Staind, so that alone, plus this being a better song, makes this one much better to listen to.  I wanted to say makes it a better song, but I thought that'd be redundant.  Oh well.  Trial Of Tears etc. 7/10 is a little longer than it needed to be, but it's an ok way to end the album.  I really think Lines In The Sand should've been the closing track, cause what a way to end it..  But whatever.  I don't really remember this one as well as the others, except the chorus which is decent.  The intro reminds me of Rush's Xanadu.    This probably isn't a good place to start your Dream Theater collection, Images, Awake, and Scenes are the best albums to start with, but it's a nice addition.  Although it's a bit different, it's still a prog rock album, and it's done very well.
0385342055|2.0|I have loved the shopaholic series from book one but unfortunately, with the latest installment, I was left on the verge of despising Rebecca. I find her annoying, munipulative, immature and basically a pathological liar. For all her bad behavior there are no repercussions and she still comes out smelling like a rose. I need growth, maturity and some realization that she is not the center of the universe. Perhaps that is too much to ask, perhaps this character is just showing who she is and always has been; a shallow, self-centered waste of space.  I am still a Sophie Kinsella fan. I'm sure there will be a follow up novel and I'm sure I'll still give it a go. However, as of now I'm more of the Madeline Wickham allegiance-at least I don't hate the main characters.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|Congratulations, while it was probably unintentional, the writer, director, producers, actors, and everyone else affiliated with this movie have finally found the cure for insomnia. No need to purchase expensive drugs that can leave someone with an addiction that ruins their life. They can spend $20 and get the best night's sleep for the rest of their life by spending 15 minutes watching this movie.  That being said, how does everyone find this movie visually appealing? I saw 15 minutes of screensavers and people whispering nothingness. This was the absolute worst 15 minutes of my life. This movie should be boycott by human rights organizations because this movie is cruel punishment and torture.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I really enjoyed Kick-Ass so it was only natural that I would purchase it for myself. This combo pack covers all the bases: Blu-ray, DVD, and digital.

0385344325|4.0|As a big Lee Child fan (Jack Reacher) I got a special enjoyment from this because he incorporated Reacher's back story into the plot line. Reacher's a one-of-a-kind character and I've been hooked since my first read.
B004LROUNG|4.0|If you're a longtime Grisham follower/reader as I've been over the past many years, 'The Litigators' might be another welcome addition to your collection.  I say MIGHT because the author is reaching back for old material and cobbling it together for a fresh approach on this novel.  It's like an automobile manufacturer taking the frame of a popular unit and using it as the underpinings for several nameplates in its lineup.   You'll find familiar ground covered earlier in 'The Street Lawyer', 'King of Torts', 'Runaway Jury', and 'The Associate' but Grisham is able to come away with a nicely thought out yarn that should capture your attention because of his obvious writing skills and some of the compelling research he did in building the story.  Again, Grisham rushes the book to the finish line, then ties up the loose ends in a hurried narrative epilogue at the end of the story which is getting a little tiresome.  I wouldn't say this latest work is Grisham's best or even in my top 5 selections from him but it's not among his weakest efforts either.  I'll give it somewhere in the 6-10 range which is better than he's been doing of late but far from what he's capable of delivering.

B003L77GHE|4.0|The second season is much more thrilling than the first season. The whole story is aiming at the appearance of the mysterious \\"Klaus\\" and before his appearence you never know who or what this \\"Klaus\\" really is. So you are anxious to know during the whole season. There are also new interesting facts about the vampire world, the witches and the werewolve world and they are all credible in the movie. Thus, the storyline is very good and the characters became all more interesting. However, it was a little bit too bloody for my taste. I think it would have been equally thrilling with a little bit less killing and with less torturing scenes.   All actors are doing a very good job. They are all convincing and you always think that the character could really be like this if he or she would exist. Nina Dobrev has a very difficult job, because she has to play two characters; one is very lovely and selfless and the other character very selfish; and she is doing this very well.   All in all the whole season is very good entertainment, but you also need nerves.
0553057006|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone who has had a troubled relationship with anyone in their life.  It's very reader friendly and easy to understand.  The concepts are presented in such a way that anyone can \\"get it\\".
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|I really enjoyed Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, and am surprised at the mixed reviews it has received in this forum. Most people allude to the fact that it's the darkest and most violent of the 4 films. Well....ONE of the movies must claim this title, and this one is definitely it. Also, people refer to the disturbing images of child slavery and cruelty in this film. All I can say is that while it's not pleasant to see, it's still part of the story, and if it weren't relevant to the plot, etc., then it would've been left out by Mr. Lucas and Mr. Speilberg. On a more positive front, the movie excels in action and suspense; there's a certain \\"energy\\" to the film, whereas the first film has a certain 'pureness' to it, along with energy. I must say that there are two things that jump out at the viewer when watching this film: First, Indy's new woman (Willie Scott) is an extremely annoying character who screams way too much. In a lot of ways, she simply doesn't fit into this movie. This movie is dark, and her character takes us out if this realm each and every time she lets out a scream or says something stupid. Also, is it me, or does her hairstyle not fit 1935? It almost seems like an 80's hairstyle. I was extremely frustrated with Willie, as she cast an imbalance on the film. Second, while I know that this is a movie that has its cast  inside a temple, it nonetheless has a restricted feel to it in that there aren't enough locations that are explored, thus making it clausterphobic in its setting. This movie reminds me of an action video game, though it maintains its substance and purpose. Overall, this movie is a worthy second installment in the series. The mine cart sequence is worth watching, by the way.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book has been definitely a page tuner for me. In my opinion, the author suceeded in passing on the feelings of the characters on to the reader fantastically. It is evident that a lot of research has been made about the Frech Occupation and the infamous date when the Jews were basically abducted and sent their demise. I loved it throughout and I am eagerly awaiting to watch the movie to see whether it renders it justice.

B005ER6STG|2.0|Ok, I just watched \\"A Serbian Film\\" and lets get one thing straight...it is deffinately sick, perverted and wrong in every sense of the word cut or uncut version.  The director can try and justify his film by saying he was trying to show how people in Serbia are treated and oppressed, but bottom line is he set out out to make the most disturbing film he could that would cause controversy which in turn would give him free press and notoriety and he succeeded.  If other reviews are trying to convince you that it was created for art, political or any other reasons then they are fooling themselves and being dishonest with you.  Plain and simple....If you want to watch a sick and dememnted film involving graphic violence, nudity, rape and child rape/pornography that you will not soon forget, then by all means knock yourself out but if you even think for a second that this is something you would rather not see then you should not watch.  Personally, not much bothers me in film but I feel kinda dirty and like I may have been a participant in a very wrong crime for watching this.
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|When you assemble in one place such comic luminaries as Judd Hirsch, Alan Alda, Matthew Broderick, Eddie Murphy - each in his own right a legend in the last millennium, even if they've all been quieter this one - and have current A-lister Ben Stiller into the bargain, then questions about values of parts and the sum of the whole will surely arise. While Tower Heist is a well-executed, lively and entertaining feature, it would have to be special indeed to live up to its billing. It doesn't, quite.<br /><br />Alda plays it straight as Arthur Shaw, a Bernie Madoff style tycoon living atop the titular Tower, an exclusive Manhattan high-rise with a swimming pool on its roof decorated with a $100 bill. Stiller is Josh Kovacs, the perfectionist building manager for the Tower: A soul of discretion and tact, catering to every possible whim of his residents. He lives way uptown on the other side of the tracks, arises at the crack of dawn, irons his own shirts, plays chess online with Shaw, and still arrives before his clients awake. He also looks after his ever-loyal staff: Josh has arranged for the staff pension plan to be invested by Shaw, a genius money manager, who has reluctantly acceded to the request. No prizes for guessing the surprise Alda has for everyone, and which drives the action in the film. Alda is put under house arrest by improbably-named FBI hack Gertie Fiansen (T&eacute;a Leoni), but not before secreting away $400m of missing cash, the only remnants of which are some modern art-works and Steve McQueen's 19634 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso, which he has had restored and installed in his top-floor penthouse living room: how the other half live, to the max.<br /><br />Josh hatches a plan find the cash and steal his staff's pension back, and ropes in a few helpers. Much frivolity and hilarity follows. Eddie Murphy is Slide, a local hood in Stiller's neighbourhood, enlisted for his criminal smarts, and is on fine form,  machine-gun wise-cracking as if Beverley Hills Cop was only yesterday. Matthew Broderick is an overweight quant, down on his luck and recently fired from Merrill Lynch, who adds a couple of nice lines but generally seems underused, or perhaps overwhelmed, by the occasion. Judd Hirsch plays Stiller's boss, and he plays it even straighter than Alda.<br /><br />There is an interesting on-screen rumination about the value of parts as against the whole which I can't disclose for fear of spoilers, but given the cast it struck me as ironic to say the least.<br /><br />This is a fun Manhattan caper movie, but never quite reaches its potential. Tina Fey and Steve Carrell's Date Night was to all intents the same film, only better, but it was bracing all the same to see Murphy in top gear, greats like Hirsch and Alda on the screen even if they didn't have much to do, and interesting to see what had become of Broderick, although on this showing, I fear he is likely to head right back into the Where Are They Now file from whence he was apparently plucked.<br /><br />Fun, but inessential<br /><br />Olly Buxtonew Broderick is an overweight quant, down on his luck and recently fired from Merrill Lynch, who adds a couple of nice lines but generally seems underused, or perhaps overwhelmed, by the occasion.

B005XI4VGI|5.0|This series is starting to pick up steam, although even the pilot was pretty intense.  There is a mid-level gore factor, but there's a good twisted plot to back it up.  Some pretty fine acting, too.  Jessica Lange!  The rest of the cast is quite good as well.  The ensemble might not be up to say \\"Breaking Bad\\" or \\"The Killing\\" standards, but pretty damn close.

I'm sure that Robert Downey Jr. has a part to play, either David or Jerry.

0756405890|4.0|I will not add to what others have already said. I will say however that this story has a lot more to it then people think. The reason why Hobb, Martian and King have all said this is a amazing book is because of what's hidden behind the the words. Maybe only a writer or a deep thinking puzzle solver can truly understand the depth of this book. What's truly amazing is that the simple will love it for it's top layer, the mediocre will hate it for lack of understanding, and the intellectual will marvel and speak with friends over the complexity of it.     I can understand all the people who were bored by it I know where your coming from. Simply you just don't get it and that's ok.     I can understand the fanatic fans who bite and chew on those who give it one star , simply you don't get it either and that too is ok.  In the end it really doesn't matter till all three books are complete and time passes to show if it really is a great series.  As for me I stand with the writers who get it. 4 stars because I have yet to read a book that is 5, 5 stars would mean the book is perfect.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This novel was true to character for JG. I really like the way he led into this book and gave a vivid look behind the scenes, to later support the plot. It involves a stereotypical view of \\"street lawyers\\" and feeds that view with the comical actions of three comical fellows. This was the first novel that I found myself laughing, out loud. Comical and yet very touching. This is the first novel that I was able to see the outcome before long into it. It is not one of the \\"blow your mind\\" lawyering books that is typical. The comedy added a fresh touch to it and kept it intereting. I suppose I may attribute my ability, or lack there of, to the fact that I have been reading Grisham for a long time and connect with the author as the story is laid out. Overall an A- / B+ , but, worth the time and money in every way.<br /><br />All the best ~!~
1609611543|5.0|I just read in Time Magazine this month that menarchy (the age of the onset of menstruation) has been dropping precipitously for girls, and that exposure to this level of hormones has been linked to cancer and other health problems. Why are girls getting their periods so much sooner? Obesity is one guess. Girls are substantially more obese now than they ever have been. The article concludes that some really bad things are happening to our 'Little Women,' but, well, nobody knows quite why.<br /><br />I think Dr. Davis would take a guess at this, that it's another example of wheat doing funny things to our bodies. I also know that I would agree. \\"Healthy whole grains,\\" which comprise such a huge proportion of our modern diets, and which have been so highly genetically manipulated, may be making girls fat and causing massive outputs of insulin that could be changing their biological functions in ways that we have not yet fathomed. Since I read Wheat Belly, I have noticed more and more such extensions and confirmations of Dr. Davis' thesis, namely that inordinate increases in insulin have caused a vast and increasing number of health problems, and that most likely culprit behind the insulin flood is wheat. And wheat, like any convincing villain, is everywhere. All of this is exacerbated by current government-backed dietary recommendations that emphasize the importance of consuming plenty of \\"healthy whole grains.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Davis suggests that today's wheat is not the same wheat that we ate 50 years ago. He cites an interesting study where scientists analyzed blood collected between 1948 and 1952 for routine physical examinations of healthy military recruits. The scientists tested the vintage blood for IgA antibodies. After making sure that IgA antibodies were stable, they tested the blood for evidence of celiac disease. Comparing the preserved blood samples to blood drawn from similar contemporary subjects, investigators found that celiac disease is four times more prevalent in today's subjects than it was in those of a half-century ago. Similar studies found similar results. What has changed? Human DNA has probably not changed that much; we are separated from those men by a maximum of four generations. Wheat, however, may have changed substantially. Wheat and grasses have a very flexible polyploid genetic make-up. Grasses change quickly, and corn has even been shown to have a jumping gene. Wheat may have changed on its own over the last few centuries, but in the last few decades has been even more fundamentally altered by far more radical means, including radiation and chemical mutagenesis - all to increase production values and profits. This new wheat would not be recognizable to our ancestors, Davis asserts. And this new wheat might just be making us fat and sick.<br /><br />My own experience in eliminating wheat has resulted in curing what I thought would be lifelong chronic dyspepsia. I've lost a bit of weight around my middle, which is nice. I did not have much to lose.<br /><br />Written the way a good non-fiction work should be written: the premise is laid out in full, then thoroughly documented. Additional details are added as well, in fact, the scariest thing that Dr. Davis discussed were the advanced glycation end products (AGE) that arise from high insulin levels. AGE products have a high impact on biological functions as disparate as vision, circulation and mental function, and have been associated with cataracts, atherosclerosis and dementia. Dr. Davis' assertions are as global as they are novel, and as well supported with copious peer-reviewed scientific research.

B0055SWM08|5.0|lots of fun, many great puzzles to test your mind. so far very addicting. six more words to meet the review minimum.
0385534639|4.0|I bought this book mostly because I was interested in the romance, there wasn't as much as I had hoped, but I still enjoyed the story. The way the author told the story was interesting but kept me feeling disoriented as I tried to piece together what was happening. Overall it wasn't quite what I expected but I am glad I bought it and got to experience this magical world the author created.
0553801473|1.0|It reads like one of the weakest books in the WoT series.  So much useless detail that does not move the plot forward.  Remember when you had a paper that was due in two weeks and you tried and tried to write something and couldn't come up with anything.  But you put in enough filler that if changed the spacing to 1.5 and picked a different font you would get your minimum 10 pages, 8 of which was just restating the question ?  Yeah that paper is pretty much this book.
B000MTOLDG|5.0|i think BASTARDS is one of the best albuns by the METAL PUNK LEGEND MOTÖRHEAD!!!!!songs like ON YOUR FEET OR ON YOUR KNEES, BURNER, DEATH OR GLORY, I AM THE SWORD, BORN TO RAISE HELL and LIAR are MOTÖ gens!!!! BASTARDS is way rawer and faster than previous MOTÖ albuns like rock n´roll and 1916...It´s a return to the fury of ORGASMATRON, one of their best...in fact, BASTARDS is the best MOTÖ album since ORGASMATRON...one of their best, TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you like the fast HEAVY PUNK of Lemmy and his mates!!!!!! WELL DONE!!!!!
B000MV90IU|5.0|It's difficult to imagine a more iconic film than Bullitt. It has always represented, for me, a core theatrical experience, the essence of what it means to see a film. We all waited for many years for Bullitt to come out on Blu-Ray, which is the only format that does this film \\"justice\\". Watching Bullitt in anything less than widescreen format is a waste of time. I am delighted with the Blu-Ray release -- It is everything, technically, I could wish for.<br /><br />And yet it has been so many, MANY years since the initial 1968 release, that one must now recollect what makes this classic crime film so special and unique. What was cutting edge and fresh then, has achieved a cliche/cult status today.<br /><br />There are a lot of 1 and 2 star reviews here on Amazon that are almost comical in their dismissal of this film. And that's OK. If you were brought up on Bourne Identity or Batman, I can understand how Bullitt could seem  dated, anachronistic. But then, you'd have to say that the Maltese Falcon, from 28 years earlier still (1940), is also \\"outdated\\". Fine.<br /><br />Bullitt came out of a long tradition of Warner Brothers crime films, going way back to the 1930's. Warner's traditional theatrical distribution territory (before the breakup of the major studios) was the Midwest, and their story department was influenced (if influenced is even the word) by the organized crime culture that grew out of Prohibition. (An unusual period in American history from 1920-1932). Think Al Capone. Chicago.<br /><br />But no one had more empathy for the common man, or got down and dirty with crime and law enforcement, or understood life on the street, better than Warner Bros. They owned the tough-guy genre. Bogart and Cagney came out of that whole scene -- the tough loners. Car chases and gun shots were Warner Bros' stock in trade for many years. Anybody else that tried to muscle in on WB's tough-guy territory came across like wimps.<br /><br />But Bullitt elevated the detective genre to a new, hyper-realistic level. It was real this time, because it was all shot on location in San Francisco, which was a new thing in the 1960's. Developments in film, cameras, and changes in the studio system itself, made it more feasible to shoot on location than ever before. Steve McQueen insisted on it. Independent, auteur filmaking made this possible. He and director Peter Yates were the team that brought Bullitt to the peak of realism. (See special features on the disk for much more about this.)<br /><br />So as a result, Bullitt gets really, really immersed in San Francisco. Not just in the places, but the use of  non-actors after the shooting, in the hospital, and especially whenever police are on the scene, make this film maximally immersive in time and place. No acting in any film was ever more transparent, more real. I don't even know how you can call it acting, you need another verb to describe it. The background layer of the city itself really holds just as strong a pride of place as the human characters. The two fit each other like hand in glove.<br /><br />The visual style that Peter Yates and Director of Photography William Fraker have put together here is extremely important, and it's consistent with the way Steve McQueen looks around with his big pearly blues. From the beginning open title sequence, a \\"wandering follow focus\\" style of shooting puts a marvelous, exploratory depth into the layers of action, searching, scanning constantly for his suspect. The follow focus guy in Bullitt is an essential part of the cutting edge 1968 style, lending a freshness and spontaneity to all the locations.<br /><br />It all just seems to \\"happen\\". Because Bullitt is much more than just characters, events, or dialogue. Thanks to Peter Yates, Bullitt is a texture you can feel, it's a way of life in San Francisco in 1968 you can absorb in your bones. There's half-submerged dialogue that is thrown away, beautifully mumbled, improvised, or muffled in layers of caked blood. Bullitt seems to balance drama and documentary on a knife-edge. This, too, was new.<br /><br />You can feel the happening in the suburban ladies talking about pruning their rose gardens in Walter Chalmer's \\"home\\" -- which is so huge and extruded, it feels more like a public structure. You can sense it in the subtle hints of the emerging counter-culture, the improvised details of the city and the street. You can feel it in the friction between Bullitt's blue-collar world and Chalmers' privileged and patrician environment.<br /><br />So there it is: At the core of the story is class warfare, the nose-to-nose conflict between Chalmers and Bullitt. The search for the real Johnny Ross (the Mafia witness Chalmers wants to see in court on Monday morning) is the macguffin that facilitates that conflict. The hypocrisy of Chalmers is the role that immortalizes Robert Vaughn, not Napoleon Solo. Chalmers' fantasy of power is that he's going to \\"expose the organization\\"...but he ends up exposing himself. He IS the organization.<br /><br />And it is all so relevant today...the \\"juice\\" is there now more than ever, the smell of money, of influence in politics, and it permeates the whole system. Chalmers has his own people -- bright young law grads, police captains and the like, who get things done for him. And soon, Bullitt's job is on the line, he's under political pressure.<br /><br />Another theme, of course, was how far down into the \\"gutter\\" does a cop have to be to do his job? The conflict between Lieutenant Bullitt and girlfriend Cathy hinted at this issue, a theme that, like guns at the airport, now seems so naive. A cop is troubled by the moral boundaries of his work? Well, Popeye Doyle (The French Connection -- 1970) took care of that. Dirty Harry (1971) nailed that one, too. Dirty Harry was Clint Eastwood's direct answer to Frank Bullitt's moral dilemma. Harry Callahan was going to straighten out subversive San Francisco once and for all. (The subtext: Bullitt of course, wasn't going after \\"subversive\\", leftist San Francisco at all, but the nation's organized crime problem that FBI head J. Edgar Hoover had consistently failed to acknowledge for years.)<br /><br />But Cathy, Bullitt's woman, is sensitive enough to be troubled by violence. Actress Jacqueline Bissett is too pretty to belong in this picture, but she contrasts so nicely with Frank Bullitt's hard-boiled world, and brings a touch of culture that, along with everything else, turns Frank's life into a high-wire act. And makes it a life worth living.<br /><br />The bone-crunching violence was real, too, as blood started to flow on the screen as it never had before. Bullitt was never for the faint of heart. The moment that discreet, professional hit-man (John Aprea) slammed Albert Renick with the Winchester Pump in the dingy room at the Hotel Daniels, crime films would never be the same. The low source music on the radio was SO MUCH a part of that terrifying experience, like a narcotic dose of a pain-killer, soothing yet eerily indifferent as life drained out of the victim.<br /><br />But if Schifrin's source music worked in favor of the realism, the score worked against it. The big-band elements of Lalo Schifrin's score carbon-date Bullitt, and at times the bluesy big band is overbearing. The preamble to the car chase was overdone, announcing too brashly, \\"get ready for something big.\\"<br /><br />But I crave the cold, edgy string clusters (such as those that open the film), the percussive, tension-inducing claves and shakers. Rock N Roll wasn't ready for this scoring assignment. Rock could only subvert itself in a crime film, become part of the crime itself. And Bernard Herrmann or Jerry Goldsmith wouldn't have been right, either. No way. Somehow, Schifrin bridged the musical gap between cops and culture in a new and very personal way.<br /><br />So much has been said about the car chase, which has been imitated and expanded upon, from movies like Vanishing Point, to the Seven Ups, Ronin, Live and Die in LA, and on and on. Of course the classic Shelby Mustang vs Dodge Charger confrontation has since been \\"eclipsed\\". The Bullitt car chase is the sequence that other action films and teams of stuntmen will measure themselves against, always.<br /><br />But what blows minds too, is the gun battle and the final chase inside the airline terminal, from the days before metal detectors and x-rays. Can anyone born after 1970 even imagine bringing a gun on an aircraft? That is totally insane. But that is the way it was. Security for the time was extremely lax, but those circumstances wouldn't last much longer.<br /><br />The money really shows on the screen when you've got men running amongst jet airplanes, shooting at each other on a real airport tarmac, weaving in and out of luggage carts. Wow, how did they do that?? Men actually DO sweat, my friends. The trembling shriek of the offscreen woman just after Ross has been blown away by Bullitt through the pneumatic doors -- he's lying there in a pool of his own blood -- is among the most startlingly real sounds in any film, ever. How did they DO that?? Who IS that troubled woman? She's not an actress.<br /><br />Bullitt has not only gritty realism, but stark, cutting-edge design which starts with those simply incredible opening titles. Amidst an abstract tableau of frozen extras pretending to be mannequins, tear gas, screeching tires, and broken glass, Pablo Ferro's beautiful, flowing \\"negative space\\" title wipes and Lalo Schifrin's latin-jazz main title merge to create the most graceful, utterly cool open title sequence in all of cinema.<br /><br />You can't deny those open titles are Bond-influenced. The up and down minor guitar notes of the Bullitt theme, and the exquisite opticals owe some debt, I think, to 007.<br /><br />McQueen as Bullitt is soulful and woeful, subdued and pensive. It's a counter-intuitive way to play against what movie detectives had traditionally done: talk, ask questions, and talk some more. Frank Bullitt doesn't make any speeches -- you can leave that to Chalmers and the rest of the 1 percent. Bullitt's strategy to solve this crime is to shut up, hide the dead body and let other people ask the questions.<br /><br />Supporting members of the cast are unforgettable, including Don Gordon as Delgetti, Simon Oakland is pitch perfect as Captain Bennet, Pat Renella and Felice Orlandi (the confusing \\"Ross\\" twins), Norman Fell, Georg Stanford Brown, Carl Reindel. Real, real, real. How did they make it so REAL???<br /><br />In short, every crime film ever made since Bullitt has become about male goaling -- the burning desire to achieve a goal, no matter what the cost. Sex and violence are the very shaping forces of every species on earth. They aren't just tools of dramatic artifice. To survive, you always have to push the envelope to a new level. That's what Bullitt does best.anized crime problem that FBI head J. Edgar Hoover had consistently failed to acknowledge for years.)

I had planned on adding a video card, so I didn't even realize this when purchasing. If you are looking to utilize on board graphics, be aware. Other than that, no issues to report. Nice expansion and layout. Has 3 sys fan connectors (actually 2xsysfan and 1xpowerfan). Not sure what the power fan connector is for (how it differs from sysfan), but I have been using it as a 3rd sysfan without an issue. Thumbs up so far.

I am glad that he did sing songs that were within his age range -- he will have time for the more 'worldly' songs later.  I am not sure they would be believable at his young age.  He does have a voice and this is a great first album.  I cannot wait for the next one.  I love his voice from the first American Idol audition.

But not knowing adds that much more to the mystery and magic of the book.  Told by a 5 year old boy, this story is amazing. Just read & enjoy, i promise you will not want to put it down.
0316098329|5.0|I belong to a book club whose members meet every six weeks, taking it in turns to choose books for group discussion. When I recently announced that my next choice was Room by Emma Donoghue, I was greeted by a sea of concerned faces.<br /><br />Room is told in the voice of a five year-old boy, Jack, who lives with his Ma in a room measuring 11 feet by 11 feet. Ma and \\"Room\\" are his whole world - the implication being that it's a situation similar to the real life stories of Natascha Kampusch and Elizabeth Fritzl who spent years locked away in hidden rooms against their will.<br /><br />It was hardly surprising that my book club friends had doubts about my choice. But by the time our book club discussion came around, they all agreed that Room is a worthy read.<br /><br />While the subject matter has dark and depressing undertones, Emma Donoghue takes our focus away from that and places it firmly on the dynamics of Room.<br /><br />Jack is oblivious to the outside world and the circumstances that led to Room. It is heart-warming to view the world through his child eyes.<br /><br />However, this is also a story about Ma. Through Jack's narration, Emma Donoghue provides an insight into what life might be like for Ma.<br /><br />What would it be like to live confined to a small room with a young child?<br /><br />What would you tell your child if you lived in Room?<br /><br />How would you protect them and give them the opportunity to live their life to the full?<br /><br />What would you do as your child grew older and became aware of the world outside?<br /><br />This is the story of Room.<br /><br />You can read more of my book recommendations at [...]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0316098329 Room: A Novel]]
0316017930|3.0|This book, as other books by this author is long. Not long as in many pages, but long as in goes on & on & on & on on topics that do not need to be dragged out. \\"COME ON MAN, I GET THE POINT\\"   The main topics are pretty interesting. Given he does need to provide evidence to support his statements, the evidence is so uninteresting. As an author he should have toned it down a bit if the topics were dry.   Will not be buying any more books written by mr. gladwell -- there are enough boring things in the world that are free.
0439023521|5.0|When I tell you what The Hunger Games trilogy is about, you might question my judgement.<br /><br />It's set in a futuristic world where the Capitol reigns supreme over the oppressed Districts 1 to 12.<br /><br />To keep them in their place, each year the Capitol selects two children from each District - one boy and one girl - to compete in an annual reality television show.<br /><br />Their mission: To kill the other contestants. Last child standing wins.<br /><br />Despite this macabre premise, The Hungers Games trilogy - consisting of The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay - is a compelling read with a serious message about war.<br /><br />It's teen fiction in the same vein as John Marsden's Tomorrow When The War Began series.<br /><br />While written for a younger audience, The Hunger Games appeals across age groups. I have a number of friends in their 20s and 30s who devoured all three books at rapid pace.<br /><br />This is partly because it's an easy read, partly due to the strangely gripping plotline and partly due to author Suzanne Collins' ability to end chapters with cliffhangers that leave you wanting more.<br /><br />You can read more of my book recommendations at [...]
B002XTBEDI|3.0|The original Cranford made me laugh and cry. I was attached to the characters, and they were very believable. This follow-on was a little silly. The new characters were too contrived. There were too many jokes from the original that kinda fell flat. Things moved too fast to be enjoyed.  My feeling is that it is a very mediocre sequel to a fantastic original.
0307946711|5.0|Where will you be on this day in 20 years' time? More importantly, who will you be with?<br /><br />One Day by David Nicholls tells the story of Emma and Dexter, who hook up on their last night of university before going their separate ways.<br /><br />The book charts the highs and lows in their friendship over the next two decades, revealing one day in their lives - 15 July - each year.<br /><br />Author David Nicholls also writes for film and television and One Day will hit the big screen in 2011. His TV credits include the third series of Cold Feet, and One Day has a similar feel.<br /><br />He creates detailed characters and a growing sense of anticipation in One Day - will they or won't they?<br /><br />Emma loves Dexter and Dexter might love Emma...but then again, he loves all women and has a very short attention span. Will Dexter ever get his act together? Or will Emma get fed up and move on?<br /><br />Relationships aside, One Day is also a reflection on the major life events that shape our 20s, 30s and beyond. It's sometimes funny, sometimes sad and instantly familiar.<br /><br />You can read more of my book recommendations at [...]
B001QXCYZY|5.0|At first I was a bit skeptical about this mic being that it was USB powered but I decided to risk it and try it out. The mic itself looks and feels like a high end condenser mic and overall it is very appealing to the eyes but it's responsiveness was nothing to brag about. So I thought I might have to send it back but BOY WAS I WRONG because after a few minutes of adjusting the mics recording levels......it worked like a champ and once again Behringer delivers a quality product that will do virtually anything you can think of. If you can't figure it out than you're doomed but like many things if you can get it to work properly than this is the mic you've been looking for.
B005KAJPY2|4.0|As a fairly new VNV listener (just the past couple of years, thanks to a devoted fan who got me into them), I'm only somewhat familiar with their early works... From what I've heard, the lyrics, while always powerful and mostly uplifting, have been overshadowed somewhat by a more industrial sound (with some VERY noteable exceptions such as \\"Dark Angel\\" and \\"Beloved\\").   With Automatic comes more of a focus on getting the listeners to really hear the words over the music, I believe. The music is still very dancible and GREAT to drive to, but this time, the lyrics really stand out for me. There are some really standout tracks here, but the biggest for me up to this point (only a couple listens in) has got to be \\"Streamline.\\" Just a powerful track that really hits home.   Older fans of the band (like my friend) may have to take some time to warm up to this one, as they did on the last, but I believe this will become another heavily rotated disc (or download) in their collections as well.

B0041KW4X6|4.0|-> BLU-RAY review  ONLY for Italian release \\"Il Grande Lebowski\\", ASIN: B0041KW4X6  Fairly good print, with some edge enhancement visible.

1589975030|5.0|This is a wonderful audio edition of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, perfect for car trips.  However, if you are planning to read along with in the book, this is not the audio cd to purchase.
159562015X|2.0|The only reason I bought this hardcover was because the digital copy wasn't available to me as a non Kindle user. I thought of buying the Kindle version and converting it for my use, but when I read user reviews, there was no guarantee that I would get code for the online test.  I think it's ridiculous that I cannot purchase the code online by itself. I also think it's sad that Amazon doesn't warn user (e.g. a nice red banner...) with \\"we recommend AGAINST BUYING USED VERSIONS OF THIS BOOK.\\"  People are buying used versions only to find out that the code with it is one time use only. Not only that, but I purchased multiple copies of the book simply because I needed multiple codes. While I don't consider myself a \\"green freak,\\" I have to admit that this is a terrible waste of waste of paper and ink.<br /><br />With that said, the contents of the book with a working code are pretty useful. However, the packaging and publishing strategy is a terrible waste.<br /><br />2 stars because I couldn't give it 2.5 stars.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I cant even say how much I loved this book.... I have read so many books lately and have liked them but something was always missing. Not with this book. Everything about this book was amazing!!! I hope she contiues to write more on Travis and Abby. LOVE,LOVED IT!!!!!
0316017930|4.0|A recent good read, which changed my perspective on what it takes to become a wild success in life. The Outliers is about how success is affected by external factors beyond individual characteristics. These factors include culture, social systems, even friends and families. Here are some highlights:  1. The Matthew Effect - Canadian professional hockey players are mostly born in the early months of a year because the age cutoff for tryouts is January 1st. These players when trying out during childhood, have months of physical development over their later-born counterparts. This is a huge advantage which gives successful candidates access to premium coaches and programmes for years, hence an even greater perceived gap compared with others. Hence this anomaly when the survey was performed.  Similar patterns are found in Major League Baseball, English Premier League, among other sports leagues.  Even when it comes to school, kids born later in the year are at a slight disadvantage.  Hard to believe, but this arbitrary external factor (cutoff dates) affects people in a very deep way.  2. 10 000-Hour Rule - it generally takes someone 10 000 hours of practice to be an expert at something. Mozart did not produce his first masterpiece until 10 years into his career. The Beatles had years of practice doing small performances in Germany before reaching super stardom. Bill Joy, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs had all that early-year access to computers before they became visionaries in technology.  3. Being Sufficiently Smart - you do not need to be a genius to be successful. In fact, many geniuses have failed to succeed as they did not receive the necessary \\"cultivation\\" during their minor years. As long as you are smart enough (IQ of around 120), you can be successful if your are raised properly. Good to know that an IQ higher than 120 does not buy you any more success.   4.Cultural Influence - your roots have much more to do with certain kinds of success or failure. Korean Air had a bad rap on high accident rates years ago. It turned out Koreans' indirect way of interacting with figures of authority, i.e., pilots, control towers, have everything to do with this. Asians tend to excel at math because our language makes it easier to cognitively manipulate numbers. Asian cultures usually treasure the value of working hard in life, which knowingly or not, helps them succeed in a subject that requires ample practice!  This book provides some encouraging takeaways for the not-so-genius people like me.  For one, given the right cultivation, we have an equally good chance to succeed as the Einsteins of the world. Take a relatively intelligent person, give him the right exposure and fostering during youth and adolescence coupled with a belief in hard work and persistence, remove the negative external factors that are rooted in your culture or circumstances, and voila, you have a formula to manufacture success!  -PTS
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used this for around 60 days, after the first day of using this, increased my level length days! Don't stop working out when you first start because you are so sore!!! EVERYONE I know that has gotten this DVD LOVED it later on.. when they saw results!!   Me.. I wanted SOOO bad to stop! But where would that lead me... still out of shape, and FAT! So as hard as it was, I stuck with it! BEST THING EVER! I didn't really diet or anything... I'm in nursing school, and am a needle Phoebe!! So I eat allot of candy!! But I did down size on meals.. Worked out so hard, didn't have much of an appetite!!  I lost 20 pounds in about 6-7 weeks!! I did this EVERYDAY! Pre-planed on a calender I made for it. That way, I'd do what I was supposed to for the day, and have the torcher be over.. but worth it!!  L-O-V-E this DVD!!!
B005J4TLQG|4.0|This movie was in and out of a few theaters a month ago and made about $1 million.  Now it's already out on DVD/Blu-ray.  Produced by the same guys who came up with \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz\\", director Joe Cornish takes this story a bit more seriously without totally abandoning the humor.<br /><br />Set in inner city south London, the film opens with a gang of teenagers mugging a nurse on her way home for the night.  Suddenly a meteor-like object falls from the sky.  While the nurse escapes her plight, the boys investigate the object which has hit a car.  They discover a hairless creature with a mouth full of razor sharp teeth.  They manage to kill the monster and move on to their usual night of fun and mayhem.<br /><br />Unfortunately this creature was just the first of many and they have picked up the scent of their fallen comrade and seek out him/her.  The boys have decided to take the body to their friendly drug dealer for storage.  Bad idea.<br /><br />While the film is done on the cheap, it is also rewarding with some genuine moments of suspense.  The boys and their nurse victim (Jodie Whittaker) form an alliance to combat the invaders.  With the exception of \\"Shaun\\" vet Nick Frost in a small role, the central gang casting are all first time film actors about 15 or 16 years old.  The film isn't glossy but the now hairy creatures have a very cool blue glow to their teeth.  This is a well made and highly effective film and one of the best of the year.
B005LJITS0|2.0|and.... then Ryan Reynolds showed up. The CG, music, and composition of the first 10 minutes of the movie had a build up that had me off my seats wanting to yell \\"woot\\".  Then intro Reynolds and I could help think that he's going to have to dig deeper to give us a compelling character in this (and his other) movies to make him memorable.

B000255LNE|5.0|Phil Collins - the amazing drummer turned front-man of Genesis, and later solo singer who carved out his own musical empire and entertained fans for over three decades is back, and has released a collection of some - and I do stress 'some' of his greatest ballads and love songs.<br /><br />The collection includes a lot of Phil's lesser-known songs, most of them that weren't big hits, but also leaving room for some classics. The album includes his big ballads like One More Night, Against All Odds and the almost kid-friendly Two Hearts from the movie Buster. But, on the bright side of the album, the collection does include a lot of his hits that otherwise were overlooked from his 1998 Hits compilation, including Do You Remember?, the somber and mellow Everyday, and This Must Be Love.<br /><br />The album for some reason chooses to have live editions of classics like: True Colors and Separate Lives, instead of the actual studio recorded versions. Also, most of the tracks here are from his 1993 album Both Sides, and chooses nearly half the tracks from that album alone here that weren't big hits like I've Forgotten Everything, Please Come Out Tonight and Can't Turn Back The Years.<br /><br />All in all, while Love Songs: A Compilation Old And New isn't a definitive buy for those new to Phil Collins music unlike the way Hits was, it still is a nice trial for those who haven't heard his delightful songs from his 80's and 90's eras. It isn't the best that Phil Collins has to offer, but it does take Seriously with love.
B003S897U0|5.0|Ah the Crowes. Such throwbacks -- 20 years ago (my god, has it really been that long?) they were reveling in raucous retro-roots-rock, when everyone else was recording ballads on all-acoustic albums. Times change, and the Crowes have too, but they are still about 20 years behind with Croweology, the obligatory \\"classics live mostly-acoustic\\" album.   Funny thing is, the idea actually works. This is one epic, meandering joy ride of an album with something for everyone, even only casual fans. The professional reviewers want to talk about a \\"ragged\\" sound, which I suppose is accurate, if a little misleading. What Croweology really feels like is a very well produced live album -- recorded by a band that certainly still knows how to ride a groove when they find one, and they riff over these classics with gusto. Some are hits, some are favorites, and some are also-rans that here have new coats of paint.  The versions of hits like Jealous Again, Remedy, She Talks To Angels, and Soul Singing that appear here are really well done alternate takes, and I actually rather prefer this album's version of a couple of them to the originals. The renditions of Share the Ride, Non-Fiction, Hotel Illness, Morning Song, and Sister Luck are fantastic, tight grooves. The band also stretches out into indulgent extended jams on Ballad of Urgency, Wiser Time and Thorn in My Pride -- all three come in at over 9 minutes, which seems horribly long on paper, but somehow doesn't get old when listening.   If there's a weak spot, it's at the very end... the version of Bad Luck Blue Eyes included here is kind of sub-standard -- which is a shame because Bad Luck has long been one of my favorites. I'm not really surprised though -- I've heard several alternate recordings of this one, and none are as good as the original. The problem seems to be, here as always, that Chris Robinson just shreds his voice early on, and doesn't have anything left by the conclusion. I give them a miss on this one, but an album that should go out with a bang, sort of goes out with a whimper.  In short, Croweology is a wonderful album, and has the feel of a \\"live\\" performance in more ways than one... in this era of albums produced as a loosely-bound collection of downloadable singles, Croweology really works as an album in the traditional sense. The tracks flow together well, particularly the break between Ballad of Urgency and Wiser Time -- these run together almost like one long track. There's no need for shuffle-mode here. Overall, an excellent album, a treat for big fans like me, enjoyable for casual fans like my wife, and a decent hook for those who are unfamiliar with the band
B0046F0PC8|5.0|This was the first Jack Reacher I ever read, but certainly not the last. His latest, \\"The Affair\\", chronologically precedes this story. I don't have that book yet. I hope it's as good as this one. At a library booksale I discovered other Lee Child fans working there as volunteers.<br />I consider these an American version of Ian Fleming, even though the author wasn't born here. A great lone rambler who has his own moral compass and finds really bad people to correct. Thank you, Mr. Child.

B004R5Z4GO|3.0|I decided to read this book because i enjoyed Mitch Albom's \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,again a true story which is another reason i was drawn to the book.   For me it wasn't as good as \\"Tuesday's\\" but i did enjoy/get a lot out of it particularly the Rabbi's take on life in general.I would have never thought, especially being brought up a Christian, that i would identify so much with his core beliefs and for that matter the Pastor's as well!  The book gave a very personal account of the Author's relationship with his Rabbi after being asked to speak at his funeral and the contrasting life of a Detroit Pastor who definately grew up on the wrong side of town! Their lives in many ways were in stark contrast and yet they both had the same devotion to wanting to make a positive difference working with God.This resonated with me because my core belief is that all Religions go back to the same God,its all about Love!

B0002HTZJI|3.0|This is the only live-album of the Chili Peppers and I expected a little more. It has 26 songs divided in two cd's, including songs from Blood Sugar, Californication and By the Way albums, some covers and some inedit songs. I think the problem is the audio quality, it seems that this album had a little post-production work, so I didn't fell the energy that you expect from a Chili Pepper's concert. The booklet only have some photos of the band on tour. I recommend this album only for truly fans, I prefer the Live At Slane Castle or the Off The Map Dvds better than this one. =D

1586487981|5.0|I enjoyed this one a lot. Felt very informative and had the right pace to introduce me to something I knew very little about.  I had naively assumed that the poor of the world just lack stuff (money, clothing, medicine, food), but that's not the case.  They do lack some of those things, but there are interesting political/human reasons that simply supplying the stuff doesn't always work.  In poor countries there's: often entrenched political corruption that keeps aid from arriving to those who need it; there are interesting and counterintuitive reasons related to innate human irrationality that certain approaches don't work (for instance, supplying free mosquito nets in Africa causes people to value them less); the prospect of getting money (loans) to the poor is difficult due to the cost of managing the small amounts of money involved and thus has created a middle market of moneylenders at exorbitant rates; micro-loans like Kiva (Kiva is not mentioned specifically in the book, but other micro-loan orgs are) do help but are not a cure-all; the One Laptop per Child approach (also not mentioned directly in the book) used to seem like a panacea to me, but after reading this I think it shoots far above the head.  Education is a big topic in the book, at all levels: both primary (through schooling), but there are also analyses of how the lack of education of the populace on the benefits of, say, medicine, clean water, and micronutrients all contribute to difficulty solving those problems.  I like the approach of this book a lot:  1) Describe a problem (e.g., lack of food), 2) use established research to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches, 3) hypothesize the underlying human motivations that influence the effectiveness of those approaches.  Steps 2 or 3 usually have some fascinating insights into human behavior that are obvious but unexpected.  After reading this book, I'm also much more interested in how I personally can help reduce worldwide poverty.

1451648537|1.0|Steve Jobs was and will be remembered as a very remarkable individual who has impacted many lives in the world.  We have a lot to thank him for providing to our daily lives. However, the portions of the biography that I have seen published show either a poor biographer or a person who is complaining from the grave.  If Steve Jobs had a complaint about President Obama or Bill Gates he should have said it while alive and faced the consequences.  If the comments were enhanced by the biographer, shame on you Mr. Issacson for you have done better.  Never-the-less, what I have seen published as teasers has turned me off from wanting to purchase and read the biography.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|In all seriousness, this is a classic piece of English literature.  Austen has amazing characters and a wonderful insight into the era.  Every English speaker should read this book at some point in their lives.
B0045ODPKY|3.0|When you watch this movie, it is important to keep in mind that it is first and most an action flick with a spy motive. And as such it has its own share of sometimes over-the-top action sequences. It was also written for Tom Cruise, but instead, Angelina Jolie took the lead. So, when a woman takes out multitudes of heavily armed men with a couple of kicks, it was meant to be a guy (not that it would make it any more believable). Considering all of the above, it is a pretty solid movie with good acting and an interesting plot with a couple of twists keeping you guessing almost to the end. It is nowhere near the action of Bourne or spy classiness of Bond, but it does the job. And, yes, in every action sequence all you see is the intent and the landing, never an actual jump, kick, drop, etc.  But that did not bother me as much as did many execution/plot errors, that could have been so easily avoided or edited...  (! Spoiler Alert !)  1. Would not blond braided hair give away Salt as a Russian spy from the very beginning?  2. How many American families lived in reclusive Soviet Union of the 70s? How many of them were involved in accidents where both parents died and only a child survived? After the first two or three someone should have raised concerns in the States, no?  3. Can product placement be any more obvious? If so, can you zoom in any closer on the Bolt Bus and Pepsi billboards?   4. Where is Russian president's security detail, when he is being assassinated?  5. Are regular city cops better equipped to transport an international double agent who just single-handedly assassinated a foreign country's leader than Secret Service or CIA?  6. What's the deal with \\"going home\\" prior to suicide mission? Do Russian spies really say that?  7. Ok, I am not a ballistics expert nor an engineer, but when you fire a couple of clips from an automatic weapon into a bullet-proof glass from no more than a couple of feet away, should you see at least some ricochet bullets? Betteryet, is the bullet-proof glass really stronger than concrete bunker walls? Why don't they build bunkers out of glass then?  8. Winter, Salt, Peabody - do CIA agents ever have real sounding names like Mr. and Mrs. Smith (oh wait, wrong movie)?  9. Isn't Chenkov a male name? Does it not make Salt not only a double agent but also a guy? That would be an even better twist!  10. Can segue into Salt 2 at the end be any more obvious?  Ok, I am all done. Sorry for the tone, but I just hate sloppy scriptwriting.

If I could cap off the ends I don't need open, or if they provided rubber caps that you could cut openings in, this would be much more versatile.  When I first saw the photo, I thought there WAS a gasket on one end, complete with rubber ferrules to slide connectors into.<br /><br />I need to provide external power using a variety of packs - rain and snow is a concern. I'll either make some type of caps myself, or purchase a regular housing and drill a hole for the external power.  I need this to run 4, 6, or 8 hours shooting lapse images - and don't want to worry about the weather! The battery pack would die way too sign - especially in mid-winter.<br /><br />So either way, I need to modify the housing. See my photos of the Gorilla Tape modified housing. I use Gorilla tape because it sticks much better than regular duct tape.
B004Z29X3E|4.0|I saw this one with my wife who loves movies about cult survivors.  This one reminded me a lot of the old movie of the week with Sally Field, Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring, except maybe that one was better.  I knew going in that Martha Marcy May Marlene was going to be telling two stories at the same time.  In the present day, Martha escapes from the dreary routine of communal living and finds her sister now married to Hugh Dancy and living at great expense in a Connecticut mansion.  The other part of the story is a continuous flashbacking to scenes from the past two years spent in the cult, or commune, whatever it was.<br /><br />Like Catherine Deneuve in Repulsion, poor Martha (played with great finesse by yourg Elizabeth Olsen) is literally scared out of her mind by what she has seen and what she is now imagining.  Could the remaining cult members, led by sinister, Mansonlooking John Hawkes, be after her to kidnap her or perhaps kill her for she knows too much?  She keeps hearing noises on the roof, suspicious noises which her sister Lucy dismisses as pine cones.  After about an hour of this casual approach, I was starting to suspect that Lucy was also involved with the cult and was plotting to drive Martha crazy, perhaps as a way to put her into a mental hospital where nobody could hear her scream.  That's how suspenseful the show is.  On the other hand, I did wonder why, if she was gone only two years, Martha has completely forgotten when to put on clothes and when to go about naked, or the fact that when you're scared, there's a social taboo against barging in on your sister having sex with Hugh Dancy who doesn't like you anyhow.<br /><br />And also from the other side, why don't Lucy and Ted realize that something traumatic has happened to Martha?  Bring her to the police, don't let her ruin your cocktail parties!  And finally, what kind of cult was it?  At the beginning of the movie, when the softening light reveals the men chowing down at table together, a wave of laughter swept the theater.  They were all so hunky and ripped, bulging out of their overalls as though Bruce Weber had selected and lit them personally.  The women are equally young, beautiful, with perfect bodies.  One woman whispered, \\"It must be a cult of supermodels.\\"r swept the theater.

B00008WT5M|5.0|I owned the original recording and didn't like it much due to the lack of sonic quality. I was very, very surprised when I listened to the Remastered version. It's like I never knew the album at all! Now, this title is one of my favorite AC/CD titles!   Believe me, you won't be disappointed! Buy again even if you own the original-You'll rediscover it all over again!
B001EOOQEM|5.0|The verdict is in...and the 1996 UK Castle remaster wins!!!<br />  I have done a Hi-Fi(and Lo-Fi MP3 player) comparison between the 2008 Rhino and the 1996 UK castle remaster....the Castle remaster wins!<br /><br /> Well, on the Rhino label release it sounds like engineers attempted to add punch and volume to the mid-bass 1.0 KHZ range and they succeeded...BUT at the same time muddied the treble clarity at around the 6.0 KHZ-10 KHZ range. Normally I like juiced-up remasters, but this one sounds forced and strained in the Mid-Bass. Imagine your speakers cranked at high volume with bass all the way up..now throw a pillow over the speaker...  It's so bad that you'll have listener fatigue and become annoyed by the second song.<br />  That's how the Rhino sounds to me.<br /><br />  The Castle remaster as compared to the original 1980 recording has been remastered with great balance and clarity. The bass drum and bass guitar have added \\"whump\\" without the muddiness of the Rhino version. Now keep in mind, the bass drum/tom recording style of the time (1980)was with alot of dampening, so don't expect it to sound too \\"Fat\\". It was intended to sound hard and tight.<br />The higher frequencies have been opened up with a wider soundstage. Dio's lyrics are much easier to understand and Tony's guitar blazes just right (especially on the guitar solos of the title track #4).<br /><br />  ...and if that wasn't enough!...the liner notes have been expanded with LYRICS!! and a short history surrounding the recording of this groundbreaking Heavy Metal recording.<br /><br />  It took me two tries to get the 1996 Import I was looking for, so do yourself a favor and e-mail the seller beforehand to verify just what version they have. The seller I found mine at was nice enough to send photos of the CD case so there was no doubt which one he was sending. **Thanks Trader Jack's!**<br /><br />  To know what the CD case looks like, look up the Heaven and Hell title and open up the long list of \\"Formats\\". Select the 1996 import version and when the user photos come up under the main photo, you'll see a photo of what the back of the Castle remaster looks like (the front is the same). It is different than the 1980 version and instead has a live on-stage photo of the band and make sure at the bottom of the back of the case it says 1996 Gimcastle Ltd/Castle Communications.<br /><br />  Simply put,the Castle remaster of Mob Rules sounds just right and I give it my highest recommendation.<br /><br /> For those of you who are just discovering \\"Dio\\" style Black Sabbath...it's a MUST BUY TITLE!!!<br /><br />****\\"I'll give you a star so you'll know just where you are.\\"****Formats\\".

After the snippets on boxed set i had mixed feelings but Disc 1 of the set is just out of this world...Mike Love; what were u thinking? The mono sound is much cleaner and crisper than I expected. I almost want to say with teh excepton of a few trax, The Beach Boys ceased to exist after this because Brian was the Beach Boys....To simplify: astounding, baroque, genius, one of a kind and as close to a perfect pop album we may ever get...I can;t afford the huge set but I bet it makes for fascinating listening.  Brian is Lennon/McCartney and George Martin all in one mind and more.  BUY IT!
0446581356|5.0|The book was the one I was looking for at a great price.  Saw this book on QVC for 3x the price I paid at Amazon.  Wouldn't shop anywhere else.
0670022950|5.0|I found this book absorbing and fascinating.  It brings together insights from world history, neuroscience, social psychology, and sociology to hammer home a provocative and optimistic thesis:  the world has moved away from violence, for reasons that are comprehensible and may, with luck, continue to impact the world.  The arguments are based on data and are convincing.  I'll admit I particularly relish evidence indicating a world where women have more power will be more peaceful.  The writing is leavened with both wit and humanity. It crackles with intelligence and is a delight to read--so much so that this long, intellectually challenging book was a true page-turner for me.<br /><br />What I could have done without...well, I am not an atheist though I'm not a religious dogmatist either.  When the author writes proudly about not being tempted to ascribe positive changes to any divine guiding hand, I'm not impressed.  Instead, I'm disconcerted to find him suddenly leaping from views solidly based on empirical evidence, to an opinion resting on no possible factual knowledge--his starry-eyed faith that there is no divine order.  His take on the Bible is, to put it mildly, one-sided (I admit it's also hilarious and he doesn't make anything up).  Anyone reading it who had never read the text in question would wonder why any sane person would take an oath with his hand on what is described as an account of murder and savagery.  The idea that the Bible contains notions that were ethically advanced for their time is nowhere acknowledged.<br /><br />Why the five stars if the atheistic stuff left me underwhelmed?  Because this is such a good book overall--the vivid and brilliant treatment of history alone is worth five stars.  I would look to another book to dispassionately examine the role of different kinds of religious faith in instigating or preventing violence.  I would certainly look elsewhere to learn about how committed Christians struggled to abolish slavery.  But I believe Pinker is right in his evaluation of the humane impact of the ideas of the Enlightenment. (Parenthetically, I have to say I found the author a little harsh in his treatment of Elizabeth I.  She was a lot more tolerant and less murderous than her dad or her sister--whom he lumps her with--and after all Mary Queen of Scots, the relative she executed, tried to assassinate her.  Elizabeth bravely faught a defensive war against Spain--the Spain of the Inquisition.  But overall Pinker's reading of history seems judicious.)<br /><br />I got this book on my Kindle.  There are negatives about that.  It's hard to make out some of the charts and a couple of places a bit of a sentence is repeated.  The index is useless.  If I were a scholar who was using this book as a source I would get it in print.  For a general reader the pros outweigh the cons, at least for me--it's cheaper, you can get it instantaneously without schlepping it home from a bookstore, and a big positive--this is TEXT TO SPEECH ENABLED.  Meaning if your eyes get tired or if you need to be physically busy, you can listen to it.  For a long book like this which is so interesting you won't want to be pried away from it, that is worth a whole lot.right in his evaluation of the humane impact of the ideas of the Enlightenment.

I constantly wanted to know more about their lives and how their story would play out! Such a touching story. It shows that love can make it through so many things.
B000099T2L|1.0|When I received this cd in the mail I was so excited to listen and hear the songs I missed hearing for the last few years since my cd was misplaced. However, this cd skipped about 10 times throughout the lenght. I mean skipping beyond being able to listen to the actual song. I was completely scammed by the seller and cannot listen to the cd at all!

B004RFYEEC|5.0|It is difficult to accurately judge this set, simply because I am so shocked it actually has been released.  While much of this material was leaked out on bootlegs over the past few decades (as well as the first official release of material on the band's box set in the early 90's), we finally have a legitimate release of a deluge of music from the aborted album's sessions.<br /><br />First, the album itself.  Using Wilson's 2004 solo release as its template, this does not entirely work as a stand-alone piece as many of the sections used here were not completed at the time of the original album sessions.  That said, it is still astonishing to hear a straight runthrough of the closest \\"SMiLE\\" came to completion.  And the vast majority of what is finished, and even most of what was not finished, is deeply awe-inspiring.  That it was so close to potentially being finalized it its own time just makes the album's history that much more bittersweet.<br /><br />Now let's get to the four additional CDs of sessions.  Simply put, these are a godsend.  It is fascinating to be a fly on the wall of these sessions, and the roughly 5 hours of material here was well chosen and carefully culled from the overwhelming amount of material on the master tapes.  There is enough material on this set to intimidate even the most ardent Beach Boys fans, and yet it is incredibly well-organized, with multiple takes and disparate elements grouped by song (in album order) and then in roughly chronological order.<br /><br />It is fascinating to hear tracks mutate over the course of multiple takes--sometimes into different songs.  \\"Wonderful\\", for example, originally started out similar to the finished track, before taking a truly bizarre detour into an entirely different song (something akin to doo wop with lyrics saying \\"Come on pretty baby and rock with me Henry), only to eventually revert to how it was initially.  You'll also hear discussions and a great many experiments, all of which are fascinating snapshots of the spirit of the times and these sessions.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too many of the surprises to be found here, but these were some of my favorite discoveries from the sessions tracks:<br /><br />- Creepy vocals done for the barnyard/animals section of \\"Heroes & Villains\\"<br />- The track which tends to show up alternately as \\"Tones\\" and \\"Tune X\\" on bootlegs really is from the \\"SMiLE\\" sessions, was written by Carl, and sounds pretty great when sourced from the master tapes<br />- Brian using the final 15 minutes of session time available with an orchestra to improvise a number inexplicably titled \\"Three - Blind Mice\\" (no relation to the children's song)<br />- Bizarre skits where Brian acts out being trapped in a piano, and then in a microphone<br />- Brian talking the horn players through getting the \\"talking horns\\" sound he wants for \\"Surf's Up\\"<br />- A chorus of Brians doing a multi-part harmony for Vega-tables<br />- The jazz improvisation that leads into a take of \\"I Want to Be Around\\"<br />- In between takes of \\"Our Prayer\\", Brian asking if the others \\"feel the acid kicking in\\"<br />- Eight-and-a-half minutes of the infamous \\"Fire\\" recordings<br />- A slightly jazzy instrumental take of \\"Da Da\\" on electric and regular pianos, that would have worked well in an early Peanuts cartoons<br />- and then the hilariously sarcastic intros to the next two takes of the same<br />- A great many variations of the different parts of Good Vibrations, many of which are quite significantly different from the passages used in the released version<br />- A Capitol promo ad telling retailers \\"SMiLE\\" will be released in January of '67, and how it is going to sell a million copies.  This is like a communication from some strange parallel universe where it really was released at that time<br /><br />Ridiculously extensive session notes often include session personnel and instruments played, the date, and usually the time, of each recording, master numbers (where available) as well as information regarding takes that were likely taped over or eventually stolen.  These are found in the 60-page hardcover book that accompanies the set.  My thanks to the designers for making a book of these dimensions a hardcover as it would otherwise be unwieldly.<br /><br />This book is half of the total experience.  It is a treasure trove of photos, quotes, reminiscences, lyrics, artwork and liner notes on a wide range of topics, and from a variety of viewpoints, as Wilson and Van Dyke Parks provide introductions, each of the Beach Boys give their own insights, Peter Reum relates the signifigance of this work, Domenic Priore provides a timeline of events and an essay on the relation of band to their peers at the time, Mark Linett gives an overview of the production of this set, and Frank Holmes describes the process of producing his imagery for the original booklet (which is also included in the 2 LP vinyl set contained here).<br /><br />And all of this comes in a box that enhances the cover art by setting the various elements at different depths, turning the originally 2D SMiLE shop into a 3D diorama.  While this component of the packaging surely added to the total cost, I think it is a nice touch and it give an unconcious indicator of what you are about to experience when opening the lid:  \\"SMiLE\\" is about to become a reality, with deeper dimensions than it ever had in previous incarnations.<br /><br />I find myself dismayed by the trend towards increasingly over-indulgent (which translates to overly-expensive) boxed sets, but here is one that truly warrants the cost.  Unlike some other recent deluxe sets, this set is truly an immersive experience--a combination of music, art and text that will be keeping me fully engaged for weeks on end, and without any unnecessary trinkets that cheapen the legacy of that music.<br /><br />A complete win.stolen.

B0009A21R6|5.0|THIS is way I bought that universal disc player!  While there are some tracks not to my taste (specifically, \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" and \\"One World\\"), I can still appreciate the music.  However, having Money for Nothing, Brothers in Arms, So Far Away, Walk of Life, in smooth, full surround sound... what could be better?!?!
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Historic !  now this is not exactly my favorite Beach Boys album but for those that have been waiting...(and waiting, and waiting) enjoy!  I tend to agree with Love, Mike Love who says that it's a bunch of snippits and disjointed, but there are certainly beautiful moments.  I guess I got my fill of \\"SMILE\\" education on the box set.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I'm in the middle of writing a story and the latest thoughts have to get added somewhere...preferably into my story. I've never really tried looking for an app that could allow me do edit and create but after seeing the reviews for this one I decided to give it a shot. And like my review states, A-mazing.   My formatting is present along with my favorite font and coloring. It links up to Google documents, which works for me and my account, so transfer and conversion is no problem. I have yet to try the Excel (next on the agenda seeing as though I have an important time saving project I'm working on) but from what I've read I can't wait to try.

It is commical, romantic, and at times heartbreaking (for those who know the original version of the story).  I highly reccommend this movie, especially for the gals that fell in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy and the romance of courtship in Jane Austen's time.
0525423656|4.0|Cassia has been working in the Outer Provinces, looking for any sign of Ky, held together by the hope of the poetry that her grandfather gave her and her memories of the boy she loves. After months, she finally picks up his trail, and learns that he has escaped with two other boys to the Carving, vast canyons on the edge of the Society's control. She escapes with her new friend Indie and the two girls follow Ky. But their reunion isn't all that Cassia expects it to be. There are secrets that Ky has kept from her, and they might force them apart once more. Will their love and will to survive be enough to keep them together?  Crossed is a much more philosophical and thoughtful book than its prequel, Matched. In between rich, metaphorical language, Condie has woven in two beautiful poems by Dylan Thomas and Alfred Tennyson that don't just accentuate the novel, but become integral elements as Cassia realizes that the poems aren't just illegal, but an vital part of the rebellion. Condie also does a beautiful job with the character development as Cassia has to re-evaluate all of her beliefs and Ky grapples with the idea of the rebellion and how it plays into his relationship with Cassia. In addition, the new supporting characters are interesting and complicated and each experiences their own inner turmoil. This drama all plays out with a fair amount of action in the rugged, beautiful, and fascinating canyons, a wonderful setting. At the end, there is a twist that readers won't see coming, and though it may be hard to accept at first, it's a tantalizing new development that has the potential to alter the dynamics between the characters dramatically. Crossed is a thoughtful, very readable book, and though its ending is a bit abrupt, it sets the stage for what's bound to be a very good sequel.  Cover Comments: Love this cover! It's very representative of how Cassia really has to re-arrange her thinking and break out of the bubble. Awesome.

B0059R5Q08|3.0|I've read Jane Eyre several times, and seen at LEAST four or five versions; I still think--hands down--that the miniseries starring Timothy Dalton is the best.  I think it must be remembered that Charlotte Bronte herself was a person of deep, passionate feeling (and, in fact, did not marry until a man of equal demonstrative passion laid his heart at her feet) and I can't help but feel that the producers of this version were more interested in an understated, romantic 'look' rather than conveying any strong depth of emotion.  The acting is certainly not terrible; it is simply not memorable, in my opinion.  On the plus side, the outdoor scenery is spectacular, and the musical score is marvelous.  It still beats watching modern films (most of which are completely forgettable) and I'm not sure if the problem is in the casting/acting, or more the fault of the director/producer.  Perhaps more intense closeups, stronger, clearer dialogue--in general, a more forceful production--may have made the film memorable.  In short, I found the whole film pretty to look at and rather blah.  But then, one of my favorite films is \\"True Grit\\" with John Wayne, so maybe the film is just fine, and the problem lies with ME, lol.  If you are full-blooded, passionate person with a lot of heart, strong-willed and decisive, then you'll probably be disappointed by this film.  If you're a hopeless romantic that sips tea in the afternoon just because Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte did the same, then you'll like it just fine :D
B0058VW36U|1.0|I love the game, but the program creates memory issues on my phone which cause it to lock up... the only way to fix it is with a hard reboot. The creator should look into more effective memory use.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Hey, it's not terribly awful.  Just a bit lacking in the \\"story\\" department.  By which I mean someone should have invested a little more time in trying to come up with an actual ending, that, in the time-honored fashion, kind of resolves most things in the film in a way that we the viewers might find entertaining.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying the ending doesn't fit.  It's just not very entertaining.  It's the kind of an ending that highlights the difference between a film with an ending and a film that just ends.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend buying Cloverfield, though it's probably worth watching once.  I happened to catch it on one of the MTV channels on Halloween at like two in the morning.  I felt in a mood to watch whatever might be on TV.  And I could have done a lot worse.<br /><br />Dracula 3000 would have been a lot worse.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|What can I say, but that it's Plants vs. Zombies!! Addictive as ever, FINALLY on Android, andrunning nice and smooth on the Droid Bionic! LOVE IT!!!
B0012QCZ54|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  I like how they tied it to the first just a little bit.  It could have had a deeper plot, but then the dancing would not have been as much fun.  overall, good movie.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|I've bought several of the bootleg versions over the past several decades and even with all those this is really worth buying.<br /><br />When it was first announced I ordered the 2 cd and the 5 cd collections but canceled the 5 cd set when I decided to buy the  Limited SMiLE LIGHT UP Box Set for several times the cost here,but it's beautiful and well worth the added $$$$<br /><br />The music is incredible and there are many tracks that I have not heard the versions here before,but the weird thing is my favorite long version of H&V from the bootlegs is not on this set.<br /><br />Listening to this makes one wonder if it had been completed in the 60's and released would the Beach Boys have fallen in to the bad career state they fell into in the late 60's?, I think not.<br /><br />Well worth the bucks if you're a BB fan.
B005DZMP00|5.0|While listening to album I was transported back in time to the 60's,and what long strange trip it has been. They never grow old, but I did. Tis nice to go back. Jerry was wrong, tne Moody Blues say thinking \\"is\\" the best way to travel.
B005QI4TP8|4.0|I just bought the US Deluxe Edition that features 16 tracks on one disc.  I've just discovered that the UK Deluxe is 20 tracks over two discs.  We were shortchanged 4 tracks!  If you're a Florence fan, hopefully this info will help you choose the right version for you.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|In 2010 when Megadeth were in the middle of 20th anniversary tour for metal masterpiece \\"Rust In Peace\\" as well as playing the album from start to finish most of the other material played was also older tracks from the likes of \\"Peace Sells\\", \\"So Far, So Good..So What? and \\"countdown To Extinction\\" only a couple of tracks from current album \\"Endgame\\" made the cut, this trend would continue during the Big Four Tour. Also original bassist Dave Ellefson was back in the band for the first time since 2001 and now we have album number 13 from Megadeth called \\"TH1RT3EN\\". To keep with the going back in time theme there's even new versions of old songs included.  Ellefson's returning influence can be heard on album opener \\"Sudden Death\\" as his bass opens the track alongside some tribal drumming a classic Megadeth guitar riff, the song is a great way to open the album and the playing is really tight throughout. The first single chosen was \\"Public Enemy No.1\\" which has a galloping riff and a snarling Mustaine, what more could you ask for? Interestingly \\"New World Order\\" is an old song, a demo version was originally included on the 2004 remaster of \\"Youthanasia\\"(so the classic megadeth line up of Mustaine, Friedman, Ellefson and Menza get a writing credit), the new version is newly recorded and of course newly produced giving it a new sheen. \\"Black Swan\\" came from the \\"United Abominations\\" sessions and has nothing to do with the film of the same name.   The song \\"Never Dead\\" is a stand out track with it's slow build up, it really has a feel of an old Megadeth track, the drums are great in this track and big credit must go to Shawn Drover who has really made that spot behind the kit his own and his playing with Ellefson is perfect. \\"Wrecker\\" is another great song that has a couple of great guitar solo's and sounds like Megadeth on top of their game almost revitalised. \\"We Are The People\\" has a guitar chugging along at times not unlike \\"train Of Consequences\\" from \\"Youthanasia\\".\\"Millennium of the Blind\\" originally also appeared on the 2004 remaster of \\"Youthanasia\\" as well, the song of course is reworked and is a longer finished version.  It would seem the 20th anniversary tour of \\"Rust In Peace\\" and the return of bassist Dave Ellefson has revitalised Dave Mustaine and giving him an appetite to revisit and explore his musical past while at the same time keeping the band sounding fresh. With this been the bands final album of a 3 album deal with Roadrunner Record's it will be interesting to see what there next step will be.
0920236251|1.0|I didn't realize prior to purchasing this book that it's a tiny version (2 inches by 2 inches) of the paperback copy. I was very upset that I didn't pay more attention to the dimensions as I was wanting a normal paperback size.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I so tire of the same ol' poser metalheads with their fickle loyalty, chronological snobbery, and self-assumed superiority on all things metal, and when it comes to MEGADETH, the worst of the worst come out of the woodwork.  Now Megadeth nor Dave need my defense, their music and their die hard fans speak loud enough, but for you folks who want a true review of this thirteenth metal onslaught from MEGADETH then pay attention to a fan from the beginning, a fan through the criticism, and a fan forever of all things MEGADETH.  1.  SUDDEN DEATH: \\"Hey, we already got that on guitar hero,\\" I hear you say; shut up, get over it, it is still awesome, epic leads, powerful, driven rhythms, Dave's spirited lyrics, and some added atmosphere for its appearance on TH1RT3EN...enough said; Oh, did I tell you critics to shut up and get over it already.  2.  PUBLIC ENEMY No. 1:  \\"That title is so over used,\\" I hear you say; If you do not like this song and its commercial appeal then go buy LULU and choke on it.  Track No. 2 is a classic thrash-formula, possibly radio friendly song, great guitar riffs, awesome intro and chorus lyrics are a plus.  MEGADETH has proven again their relevance with this tune and it better get the airplay it deserves.  3.  WHOSE LIFE (IS IT ANYWAYS):  People are crying about the title again, and their cries are irrelevant.  Track No. 3 oozes with aggression, its got a great jazz/rock feel to it in its rhythm.  The lyrics flow well and the leads are tight and technical.  Drover shines here on the drums.  4.  WE THE PEOPLE:  I hear you say \\"standard fare, unexciting lyrics,\\" and again you show your lack of metal/mettle if you are among these critics.  An obvious ENDGAME era influence with a groove metal/progression formula that is absent in much of modern metal.  Dave for president indeed, we your people will follow you through the fire!  5.  GUNS. DRUGS. & MONEY.:  Title sissies, shut up!  Great thrash slow groove, jazzy and bluesy.  Got a great 70's style mixgoing on here.  Johnny K's interpretation of MEGADETH's brand of chaos is especially note worthy here.  6.  NEVER DEAD:  \\"That's a video game track, they did that already with GEARS OF WAR,\\" you critics whine.  Suck it up and up the volume.  The technichality present on this track shows a band not afraid to put itself out there.  This song is seamless and aggressive with a rhythm that draws you in and keeps your headbanging attention.   7.  NEW WORLD ORDER:  \\"Another one we heard already,\\" I hear you say, and again your voice does not carry.  I loved this tune from the start, it only got better here and the studio treatment it deserved.  Johnny K, whatever you did to the mix here, keep up the great work.  This song finds its rightful place here on TH1RT3EN.  8.  FAST LANE:  Wow, this song jumps out at you.  The build up to the chorus and the leads and fills are all over the place, a beautiful chaotic, melodic masterpiece.  Great snarling Dave lyrics going on here.  9.  BLACK SWAN:  My third favorite track.  Dave's lyrics mean much to me and will claw your soul open if you have one.  Awesome enhancement of the intro and mix as compared to the much beloved demo version.  10.  WRECKER:  My second WOW of the album, not a woe like some you critics I read so far.  I love the lyrics.  This song made me smile because it quite simply rocked.  Thats all I need to say here.  11.  MILLENNIUM OF THE BIND:  My Second favorite track; everything I said about NEW WORLD ORDER times 13!  The mix, the additions, the sheer glory of it.  Thanks Dave for getting this one out of mothballs.  12.  DEADLY NIGHTSHADE:  A stand alone mosher, a super nova track on an album of glorious morning stars.  This track will go underrated by many critics, but do yourself a favor and do not listen to the critics.  Turn this one up and rattle your head!  13.  13:  My favorite...Tear my heart out rebuild it with metal shards and add lyrics sharper than a two-edged sword and extremely personal.  DAVE, DAVID,CHRIS, SHAWN, VIC, MEGADETH, we love you and this song bleeds your love for your work and for your fans.  As for my criticism of critics, no hard feelings, thanks for reading this review and give yourself over to an extreme highlight of the journey that is MEGADETH!  METAL BLESSINGS TO ALL!!!!
B0061IMJBI|5.0|The other reviews say this episode was slow, but I think it's just fine. There was a lot more drama and psychological events in this episode than action and that is just fine. You find that in any Zombie flick. Just look at this as one giant movie. It dispersed the action and made it so that the scenes with action were even better.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|One of the reasons why I buy these Blu-ray combos is the digital copy (for use with my iTunes library and Apple TV) and imagine my disappointment when I realized that the only way you could view the digital copy without streaming via the internet was to download the Flixter application and then on top of that when I tried to view the movie using Flixter (what a ugly piece of software to use) it crashed multiple times to the point where I eventually gave it up as a bad job. So now I have one lonely movie sitting out in Never Land and the rest of my collection in iTunes.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I am one of those poor fools who only knew Amy from the media  playing up her drug use. They seemed to totally ignore the  fact that she was the most brilliant musican,singer, and  songwriter of all time. As great as Back To Black is, this  is every bit as brilliant. It is so honest and her voice  is the highlight of each song. I can hardly stand the  fact that we won't get to hear anything more from her.  I get really mad when I think about all the publicity that  no talent singers in the U.S. get, and yet Ms. Winehouse was  for the most part kept a secret from us. When all is said and  done, Winehouse is a legend and many others will be forgotten.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Got this as a free game of the day from Amazon and I think it would have been worth paying for. I did have the problem with a reset forcing me back to the beginning, which is why I rated it as only 4 stars. Fortunately that happened only once.   I only got stuck on one level (a rooftop level). hint: I was under-utilizing the cabbages. Another hint: the roof cleaner isn't expensive and worth the coins!!!  Once you've made it through all the Adventure levels, you can go back and play individual screens to get more coins to buy more in-game upgrades (for example an extra slot for plants). You can also try for achievements - right now I'm trying to get through a daytime level with only mushrooms. Or you can go through the Adventure level a second time. This time you have a handicap: the game randomly fills 3 of your slots with plants - which may or may not be ones you'd like to use on that level.   The bad: yeah, it chews up the battery. The phone gets noticeably warm when I'm playing the game.   The good: there's actually a fair bit of strategy involved, especially at the more challenging levels.   I'm running this game on a Droid X.   Updated 11/22/2011: Downgrading it from 4 stars to 1. I've had it do a complete reset TWICE in the past 3 days. I had gone through Adventure mode once and was most of the way through it a second time, then blammo - back to the beginning. And again just now. PHOOEY.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|One of the best never released sixties albums ever. I still think it would have given Sgt. Pepper a run for its money. I do with though I hadn't ordered with Amazon. Did a pre-order only to have it shipped about three days after release. Should have just run to Target. Silly Amazon, pre-orders are made to get the same day.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|I've been a hardcore Megadeth fan for two decades now and being a singer/lyricist/guitarist have been greatly influenced by them and tend to dissect each album differently than everyone else I know. That being said, I knew not to expect \\"Endgame 2\\", but this truly surprised me. Dave scaled the leads on this album WAAAAY back, choosing instead to focus on the rhythm primarily, then riffs, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad if most of it didn't sound like he was blatantly ripping himself off. Doesn't help that Shawn & David (welcome back) only give slightly better than mediocre performances. Don't get me wrong, the axework is superb, but great playing doesn't necessarily make a great song.     The lyrics are exactly what you've come to expect, but decidedly more \\"World Needs A Hero\\" - \\"United Abominations\\" than \\"Endgame\\" quality. Some are well crafted gold, some are unapologetic expressions from the heart and some just seem settled upon as, \\"good enough, let's move on\\". A little disappointing, at least from a lyricist's standpoint. I do like the way the basic structure of each track varies, something that I try to do with my own stuff and showing that the musician wants that song to be unique unto itself, if not the best that it can be. Verse, chorus, repeat, solo, etc. get's stale and more artists should care about changing it up. The fact that it's done so well here is an example of the caliber of musicianship that has come to define Mustaine. Respect.  As other reviewers have said, some of the tracks are re-hashes of '90's era ideas & demos, some of which I think were added just to get the song count up to 13. \\"New World Order\\" & \\"Millenium Of The Blind\\" were both on the 2004 re-release of \\"Youthanasia\\", the former of which I've been listening to for over a decade. When I first saw the track listing months ago I thought, \\"No. Did he? Why would he?\\". But he did. Aside from changing maybe 3 notes it's just the demo re-recorded. Same with \\"Millenium\\". Filler tracks? For shame, Dave. \\"Sudden Death\\" was in a Guitar Hero game (or Rock Band, who cares?) a while back and \\"Never Dead\\" was recorded as the theme to an upcoming game of the same name, but those are much more recent and forgivable. Though I must say, we never saw any tracks from \\"Hidden Treasures\\" or any of the other misc. songs make their way to any other studio album before now except for \\"Dread & The Fugitive Mind\\" (\\"Capitol Punishment\\"/\\"World Needs A Hero\\"). Why not another \\"Silent Scorn\\" or some short interlude tracks? A least they'd be NEW SONGS.  This is a good album, but certainly not great. I'm sure in time I'll love it to death, but it'll take a lot of getting used to. For new fans: This should be no one's introduction to Megadeth. For vets: You'll dig it. Maybe more, maybe less, because I know only I can hear through my ears, and you might hear it differently. Despite my focusing on the negative aspects, it's well worth the $12 amazon wants. I've done my part, now the decision is yours.
B0034KZE9U|5.0|First of all, these Crocs are great!  I have been looking for a pair of black Crocs without holeys, and these fit the bill perfectly!  Even more, thank you, Amazon, for being true to your word about one-day delivery!  I needed these immediately and for a specific event.  They came very quickly and just when I needed them.    Kudos to Amazon!  This is definitely my go-to online shopping site!
0553801473|4.0|A thrilling climax to this series of science fiction.  Fun for sci-fi adult lovers of this kind of fiction.  Read the whole series.  You won't be disappointed!
B000EQ5HSK|5.0|used this with my 24-105mm L lens and it looks great on this lens! i always hate the original 24-105mm, it's just small and girly lol.
B005ZWPR06|5.0|i ate some fungus this morning and listened to the whole thing twice. At first, I was scared, because I was pretty off, but then it got better and I listened to the whole thing plus the bonus tracks. Great!   I made my own Smile a few years back, it's basically the same thing, but whatevs. It sounds really good.
0786838655|5.0|\\"The Lightning Thief\\" by Rick Riordan is an excellent book and the main characters are Percy Jackson, Annie, and Grover. When Percy was 6, his mother told him that his dad died mysteriously at sea and Percy never knew his dad. As Percy grows up, he thinks that he is a normal kid but soon finds out that he's actually very different. Percy grows up believing that Greek mythology is just a myth but soon learns an interesting fact about his parents. When a mythological monster attacks his mother and him he flees to Camp Half Blood after his mother is attacked. Camp Half Blood is not an ordinary camp, in this camp are the kids of the Greek gods and it is there that Percy meets his best friend, Annie. One night at Camp Half Blood, Percy is claimed by by his father. It is here that he realizes that his dad was actually Poseidon, god of the sea. Percy then sets off to find his mother with the help of his friends Annie and Grover.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|Ok to everyone who is wondering, Yes this movie is cut, But only by 14 seconds. Every scene that you have seen befor is still.
0525423656|4.0|Crossed has a different feel when compared to Matched. The story takes place largely outside of The Society on the edges and there is the constant threat of danger and a struggle to survive. Another change is that Crossed is written from both Cassia and Ky's perspectives in alternating chapters. What I liked about this change is that we could learn more about Ky and gain a better understanding of his personality. Some of his past is revealed and it is very sad. I sometimes preferred his chapters to Cassia's. New characters were also introduced and one in particular appears to have secrets. Indie, one of these new characters, is a nice foil for Cassia as she is an assertive and independent girl with an \\"act now, think later\\" attitude.   Something else I liked about Crossed was that we finally get to see that there are people who did not blindly follow The Society like little sheep. In Matched it seemed like everyone went along with the rules but now we see the history and that there was a group protesting the changes. When I read the first book, I couldn't help but wonder why no one protested the ridiculous rules and way of life when it was first implemented (by now the younger generations are brainwashed into accepting it) but now I see that people did protest. The majority of those who grew up in The Society like Cassia, never knew about the dissenters because it was hushed up and the people involved were either killed or they escaped. I am eager to find out more about the uprising and who the leader is.   Just like with Matched, there are literary references throughout Crossed. The book takes its name from the poem \\"Crossing the Bar\\" by Alfred Lord Tennyson. \\"Crossing The Bar\\" is used as a code for those seeking to join the uprising as the Pilot is believed to refer to the leader. It also refers to the characters crossing to safety. The importance of poetry, art, and music is woven throughout the novel. The Society places more value on technology and productivityrather than creativity but people still long for that. There is even a black market where you can trade poems to get what you want. This theme seems to be a strong pro-arts message that resonates today with budget cuts leading to schools eliminating or reducing art and music programs.   Overall I think Crossed is a good sequel to Matched though I had some issues with it. There are parts of the story that seemed too slow and at other times I wanted more explanation, particularly about the rebellion, but it wasn't provided. I suppose that I will have to wait for the answers in book three. I was also annoyed by the love triangle though Xander is not present for most of the novel. I know that this will be resolved in the final book so it is just a slight problem. I liked that Cassia is becoming more determined and starting to think for herself though she does still have her moments. I also liked the increased action and suspense in the plot. Crossed may not have the excellent world building of Matched but it does a nice job of developing the characters and setting up the story for its conclusion which I am sure will be thrilling.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Everyone is entitled to their opinion but I am giving it 5 stars, I love evrything about it. It took me a minute to realize the 2 songs appeared as bonus tracks on Youthanasia, but they(and all of the others) turned out great. No  wonder they are one of The Big Four. I'm glad they didn't get Lou Reed to sing with them.    A little trivia about Youthanasia, it came out 17 years to the day before this one came out. Me and friends waited in line at Midnight to buy it and one of my friends was dressed as Vic Rattlehead.     It really made me smile when the current lineup of the band appeared on Jimmy Kimmle last night in Halloween costumes. Good memories of good music, new and old.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|Megadeth's Thirteen is like a Countdown to Extinction/Youthanasia hybrid with bits of Endgame thrown in.  It's not exactly what I was hoping for even though it still boasts high quality musicianship. I think I would give this album a three if it was a lesser band than Megadeth, and almost did anyway.  While it does offer many good moments, it grows progressively weaker, with all the highlights coming in the first half and too many slow songs throughout the album.  I've been listening to Megadeth for many, many years, and have always thought their musical ideas sounded far more interesting when they've been at least somewhat technical and complex.  When they simplify the formula and shoot for mid-paced or slower hard rock, many of the songs get boring to me after just a few listens.  Unfortunately, over half of Thirteen falls into this category, as Dave Mustaine seems to be trying to recreate his commercial glory days of the 90's.  Personally, I think it's a bad move considering the fact that their last album, Endgame, and their participation in the Big 4 shows had seemed to reenergize a shrinking fan base.  Let's face it, the 90's are over; metal fans today don't want simplistic, unchallenging music, and mainstream hard rock fans don't want anything close to real metal, so this leaves Megadeth without strong support from either side for an album like Thirteen.  Even though their greatness shines through on several tracks, the average outweighs the strong here, making for an unsatisfying release from a band that was on the right track with their last album, but now takes a small step backward.  I wish Amazon had a half-star option because it's not quite as bad as a 3, but not quite as strong as a 4, at least by Megadeth standards.<br /><br />Thirteen does have many good moments.  Opener Sudden Death sounds like a mix of Peace Sells/Rust in Peace style thrash, except for the Cryptic Writings-sounding chorus.  The song features great soloing, above-average vocals from Mustaine, and great riffing.  It's a good song, but the chorus doesn't completely gel with the verses.  Whose Life Is It (Anyways) is an alright track, though the guitar tone doesn't sound much like Megadeth and the main riff is very simple.  The bridge sounds a lot like Youthanasia, but the vocals and beats are reminiscent of So Far, So Good, So What, especially the chorus.  It's a fast song, but not at all technical or thrashy.  We the People has a Youthanasia vibe similar to Black Curtains.  Hard rock with a metal groove.  It has a catchy riff and vocal melodies that will probably stick and strong songwriting that is a bit more technical than anything from Youthanasia.  Never Dead might be my favorite track on the CD.  It's pure Peace Sells-era thrash, with a great verse riff and vintage vocals.  The chorus sounds like one of the mid-paced ones from Rust in Peace, which works with the Peace Sells riffing in the verses.  It's too bad more of the album wasn't like this track.  The last highlight for me is the song Fast Lane, which has a Countdown to Extinction vibe; post-thrash heavy metal.  It's a good song, but not quite a great one.  It will probably end up being one of the better tracks on the album, which speaks to the fact that Thirteen is much more lightweight than Endgame.<br /><br />Now for the complaints.  Public Enemy #1, the second track, has one of the album's many less-than-incredible choruses.  It's a subdued, mid-paced metal/rock song coming right on the heels of a faster, heavy opener.  A few tracks later, you have Guns, Drugs, and Money, which sounds like a throwaway filler song.  It attempts to replicate the simplistic approach of Youthanasia with far less effectiveness than We the People.  The verse riff is simple and boring, and the vocals are not good.  Skip ahead a couple more tracks, and you get several redone, re-worked, re-recorded, whatever you want to call it, songs from Megadeth's past.  New World Order sounds slightly more polished than the version on the Youthanasia re-master, but the vocals are erratic at best.  I'd prefer the new music with the old vocals.  On Youthanasia, the song was an o.k. bonus track, and here, it's an o.k. album track.  Not great or even really good, just o.k.  The thrash section that finishes it off isn't bad, but this isn't anything you can really call a highlight.  Black Swan is even less impressive.  I haven't heard the original version, but this one, despite a catchy chorus and decent soloing, has boring riffs and forgettable verses.  A third older song, Millennium of the Blind, adds several parts to the original version and has more of a metal vibe than the songs around it, but just isn't strong enough to qualify as a \\"heavy moment,\\" for which it seems to be intended.  Moving on, Wrecker is barely heavier than Youthanasia, with an AC/DC-sounding riff in parts and similar subject matter (about a home-wrecking woman).  No thrash whatsoever, and not very memorable.  Deadly Nightshade opens with a riff that sound much closer to Metallica's Death Magnetic than Dave would probably like.  The song is mid-paced groove, a mix of Countdown/Youthanasia with riffs that sound rehashed from several past Megadeth albums.  It has some decent guitar work near the end, but it's nowhere near amazing, adding to the mediocrity of the album's second half.  Just too many songs that are only o.k.  The title track finishes things off in that vein, with yet another autobiographical summary of Dave's career set to semi-heavy, slow-to-mid-paced hard rock.  It's not bad, but it seems like Megadeth is capable of much more.<br /><br />I wish I had better things to say about Thirteen, which I had high hopes for after Endgame.  I know some fans felt this release was being rushed when it was first announced, and I'm sure its hit-and-miss nature won't do anything to answer those claims.  Megadeth is a great band, and their music is better than much of today's more popular \\"metal,\\" but I'm disappointed with this effort because so many of the songs are just good, not great.  Hopefully they'll let tracks like Sudden Death and Never Dead guide them in coming up with material for the next one.Youthanasia re-master, but the vocals are erratic at best.

B005R9U5EA|1.0|This movie thinks it is an intelligent psychological horror flick. It is not. It is one of the few movies I have ever seen that ends without any resolution, yet left me wanting absolutely nothing. I am really glad I did not pay for it. Otherwise the only thing I would have wanted, would have been my money back. It is predictable and rather shallow. I was not scared, or grossed out once, nor was I intrigued or moved. The subplot never really connects, and the characters do not seem to be real.
B005NPLXJ4|2.0|So Lou Reed has this idea kicking around for a few years that he wants to write music for a German theatre group based on a series of old plays about an abused dancer who crosses paths with Jack the Ripper.  He can't get it to sound how he wants, but then he jams with Metallica at a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame show.  Eureka!  Lou finds some young, hip rockers (compared to him, anyway) who can give him that dark, dangerous atmosphere he's been looking for.  According to both sides, he casually says, \\"Hey, let's do an album together,\\" after the jam and goes on his way.  And now, two years later, we have Lulu.  After listening to the album in its entirety, I have to wonder if Lou proposed this mess honestly when he brought it back up.  I wonder if he said, \\"Hey, guys, are you willing to jump the shark and alienate the majority of your fan base (again) to be on an album with me?\\"  And `Tallica, ever the experimenters, say, \\"Sure, Lou.  We cranked out a decent metal album a couple years ago that went #1 around the world and energized millions of our fans, but hey, you're Lou Reed!  Count us in!\\"  I'm not complaining because I'm narrow-minded or don't like variety or risk-taking.  The problem here is that, musically, vocally, and lyrically, repetition is the general idea behind these songs.  Find a basic riff and just repeat it for anywhere from 4 to 20 minutes.  Add in some noise and feedback here and there for at least some dynamics, and let Lou talk/\\"sing\\"/ramble over it until he's done.  I know this is more of a Lou Reed album than a Metallica one, but whoever it belongs to, it's not very interesting or listenable.  Considering the negative attention it's drawn, I'm not sure if many people will spring for this, but then again, since it is Metallica, it will probably sell millions of copies anyway.  Oh well.  This album will almost surely end up being just as much an anomaly as other odd forays into metal by the likes of Pat Boone and William Shatner, remembered more for its novelty than its quality.  Now, for anyone still interested, here's a track-by-track breakdown.<br /><br />Brandenburg  Gate--Very, very repetitive music and rambling from Lou; terrible vocals from both Reed and Hetfield, with Reed doing his talking/poetry reading/embarrassing random stabs at singing, and Het yodeling, \\"Small town guh-r-rrl!\\" throughout.<br /><br />The View--Simple, repetitive riff that goes nowhere; harsh, aggressive vocals from Het are somewhat surprising and hopefully hint at where he's going on the next Metallica album.  However, this song has the most ridiculed lyric so far; Het hilariously reminds us over and over that he is the table, making many listeners question his sanity (I know, the lyrics are from Lulu's POV, but it still sounds hilarious).  Lou's talking doesn't sound interesting, the boring riff doesn't sound interesting; what's to keep a person listening?<br /><br />Pumping Blood--Reed sounds ridiculous repeating the track's title over the opening riff.  The riff sounds like a prelude to some actual rocking...instead it just repeats again and again, then eventually goes into some ambient Metalli-noise over more Reed rambling.  Not something that will call out to be heard again.  The riff at the end of the song was the first time I found anything remotely interesting.  Even still, without Reed's talking, it would sound like Metallica just fooling around with their instruments.<br /><br />Mistress Dread--Starts with a riff that's faster and better than anything from Death Magnetic, but then it's ruined by Lou's attempts at singing, which are unlistenable, and constant repetition.  Seriously, the riff gets very boring after hearing it about two thousand times in a row.  No direction to this whatsoever.<br /><br />Iced Honey--Only track so far that starts out sounding like an actual song.  It's pretty bland, though.  Very simplistic hard rock track.  If they release a single, this will most likely be it; it's only about four-and-a-half minutes long, and has actual structure.  Unfortunately, it's forgettable.<br /><br />Cheat on Me--Ambient guitar sounds, in parts a bit Irish or Celtic-sounding...not bad to have in the background, until Reed comes in.  It would be different if he sounded good, but what he does vocally doesn't sound like it requires talent.  A track of mostly sounds, with a decent hard rock riff used here and there.  Some pretty bad vocals from Het.  This is the first track that I might actually like if it was an instrumental.  Musically, it builds up nicely to a fairly heavy ending.  Vocals from both singers ruin the song.<br /><br />Frustration--Reed's vocals border on ludicrous on this track; it feels more like a joke than music.  Anxiety-filled ambient noise goes into a Sabbath-inspired doomy riff that doesn't sound too bad, but Lou sure does.  Again, if this was an instrumental, it would be much more tolerable; not great, but tolerable.  It rocks out admirably near the end of the song, but there's almost a straight rip-off of the riff from C.O.C.'s Paranoid Opioid at 7:14 and 7:48.<br /><br />Little Dog--At this point, after seven songs and about 48 minutes, it's all starting to sound the same.  Some low-key acoustic playing, ambient background noise, Lou talking/rambling, sometimes trying to sing a few notes seemingly at random, a somewhat heavy hard rock riff.  It gets a bit redundant this far in, and there's still over half an hour left after this song.  I'm ready to do something else now, which is not a good sign when I'm listening to a new album.<br /><br />Dragon--Beginning doesn't sound any different from the last song.  Now it's getting extremely redundant...what seemed random during the first half now seems formulaic...some noise, throw in a riff, back to some noise.  Lou talks, tries to sing, goes back to talking.  Mighty boring.  Once the riff kicks in, it sounds like a Load throwaway.  There's a heavier riff in the second half of the song, but it sounds tired.<br /><br />Junior Dad--This one could sum up the whole album; 19½ long minutes of the same formula; acoustic, noise, riff, repeat.  With almost twenty minutes to fill, though, Junior Dad goes long on the noise, with minutes-long sections of droning guitar sounds.  It's not that it sounds particularly bad, it just gets boring after so much repetition.  Maybe if an instrumental version comes out, I'll give it another chance, but for now I don't expect to be listening to Lulu again anytime soon.<br /><br />I know these guys are Rock n' Roll Hall of Famers and all, but both artists involved have done far better in their careers.  I have no problem with them doing whatever they want to do.  It's their right and they've earned it.  However, this is a review of the music on the album, not the artists' careers, and the music is not very interesting from a metal/ hard rock fan's perspective.  There are rare moments (and I do mean rare) when Lou's vocal style actually complements the music, and for a few seconds it works.  But those moments are fleeting, and the rest of the time it just doesn't even sound serious.  I don't blame Metallica; I'm sure if Mick Jagger asked them to play music for him on an album, they'd do it in a heartbeat, just to say they played all of the music on an album from a rock legend.

1423389387|5.0|The Wise Man's Fear picks up where The Name of the Wind left off and continues the story of the life of Kvothe; university student, musician, aspiring arcanist, and much, much more. In truth, it is not so much a novel as a compilation of several distinct adventures. Because of this, I never found myself pondering how the book might end. I was more likely to wonder what was going to happen next.<br /><br />While many are tempted to call Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicle a trilogy, the word doesn't really do it justice. This is unlike most trilogies, where each book is part of the larger story yet still makes an attempt to present a semi-self contained story of its own. Rothfuss himself acknowledges this when he calls this a chronicle. He doesn't even bother to make it plural. This is considered by the author, as it should be by the reader, one chronicle of the adventures of Kvothe.<br /><br />This review is based on the Brilliance Audio production of The Wise Man's Fear. As the Kingkiller Chronicle is essentially the first-person telling of Kvothe's adventures, listening to a quality audio version is an excellent way to experience Rothfuss' books. Nick Podehl has a great voice for reading The Wise Man's Fear. He has a talent for changing his accent or the timber of his voice to present a wide variety of different characters' personalities. My only complaint, and it is minor, is that Podehl could stand to check the pronunciation of some words that are not in common usage in the modern world. While his pronouncing gibbet with a soft 'g', viscount with an 'iss' sound, ha'penny with a short 'a' and two pence as 'too-pence' doesn't ruin the story for me, it does cause me to occasionally roll my eyes and sigh.<br /><br />Young  readers?<br />I would have no problem reading this book with my teenage daughters but it does contain some mild adult language, conversations that scenes that, while not explicit, do not try hard to conceal what is happening. Keep in mind that Kvothe is now at an age where most men spend a good deal of time thinking about, in the author's words, cavorting. Parents concerned about such things may wish to pre-screen these books.<br /><br />The review copy of this book was obtained from the publisher via the Amazon Vine Program.ost men spend a good deal of time thinking about, in the author's words, cavorting.

B0052U59F4|5.0|P.A.Lupton author of Bound by Blood (The Garner Witch #1) recommended this book to me on Goodreads. And for completely selfish reasons, I took her up on her recommendation of this book. I hadn't read erotica fiction before and I wanted to compare a sex scene I'd written in my own novel, Not To Us, to make sure I was within bounds and had gotten it right. Seriously, I worry about this stuff.   Whatever. I was curious how an author \\"in the erotic/adult fiction genre\\" would pull it off.  So. The story hooked me right away. I live in Seattle; imagine my happy count to discover it was based in my town. Awesome!  The story is amazing, intriguing, intense, dark, and connects well emotionally. (I know. You thought I was describing Christian Grey, for a moment, until that last part). We are completely taken into the world of one Christian Grey who might be every girl's fantasy until she meets up with his darker secret side. E. L. James does a wonderful job of creating these characters and making them believable. The story moves along well just be warned there is a lot of sex scenes. Oh my. We are sympathetic, at times, with Ms. Anastasia Steele and feel her heartbreak and pain at others. Sometimes, her own self-worth and confidence come into play and the author does an excellent job of taking readers along into seeing the world from Ana's point of view why the mystery surrounding Christian Grey's past pulls us in. Every woman reading this wants to be able to be the one who can heal or cure Christian Grey.   I finished the book in two sittings and was sad to see it end. I was overjoyed to discover Fifty Shades Darker is already out. THANK GOD. I wasn't going to be able to wait for long before finding out what happens to these two in the next book.  Geez, I have my own third novel to write and I wasn't able to put this one down. I love Kindle for a lot of reasons, but being able to read this novel anytime, anywhere was particular helpful.  :    Katherine Owen
0618918248|5.0|This book addresses many of the arguments for religion and offers clear and compelling counter arguments.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants a general overview for why atheists aren't persuaded by common theistic ideas and therefore lack religion.  My bias: I am an agnostic that has found no evidence for a religion compelling and thus I believe in none of them (thus making me an agnostic atheist).  Every god is could exist (Thor, Votan, Lord Krishna, etc.) but there is no reason to believe they do until they're proven.

The fascinating cultures of \\"other\\" worlds.<br />9. What happens when reason faces faith...find out.  A rollercoaster of ideas, a clash of ideas a transformation ensues.<br />10. Doubts, doubts, doubts...<br />11. The differences between the religions of Islam and Christianity.<br />12. A woman's perspective adds even more to the story as far as I'm concerned.<br />13. The religious rituals and practices.<br />14. Marriage in an entirely different light. Enlightening indeed!<br />15. \\"Why should infidels have peace?....\\"  and many other thought-provoking tidbits.<br />16. Racism.<br />17. I absolutely love how Ali describes herself in a culture I'm more familiar with, just awesome stuff.<br />18. How the Dutch live and the impact it had on Ali.<br />19. The clash of cultures.<br />20. It's such a pleasure to see a reasonable mind at work.<br />21. The clarity of atheism.  A realistic philosophy at work.<br />22. The importance of thinking about ones beliefs.<br />23.

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|No, this album didnt sounds like peace sells or RIP or anything... it sounds like 13. The re recorded songs sounds great & fresh. Songs such as Black swan, Sudden death, Millenium of the blind, New world order, Public enemy no.1, Never dead will stuck in your head in first 1-2 listens while some other tracks might need few more listens to get into it. Sound production's great... Booklet includes everything, lyrics and lots of band pictures and other stuff (Vic, logo etc) I actually surprise that this record didnt sounds like the previous record Endgame which has lots of fast riff and guitar duel but its certainly a solid record on its own.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|At first you think it is a joke but soon realize in horror that this piece of total garbage is actually a reality. This is easily one of the worst if not the worst album ever made. I'm glad to see this tripe getting negative review majority And hopefully people were smart enough to listen to this on the loutallica web site prior to purchase because sales of this will hopefully fail. This album makes St.Anger look like Master Of Puppets. At first it was said to be master of puppets meets Berlin, this piece of atrocious nonsense is nowhere near either realm of those albums, it's simply garbage. Drunken babbling over repeated, recycled, drone, uninspired boring, music that a highschool band could trump that goes on and on and on for two discs. This is shameful. Watch the epk you can plainly see that none of these guys believe their own bs said about this album. Even they know it's terrible, Hammet even looks like he's going to burst out laughing during his segment, Likely at the fact that people will actually buy this turd and call it amazing for stupid reasons like: metallicas on it so it's gold, their legacy is awesome so I love it, or Metallica can dO no wrong.....well sorry friends but charging between 13 and 165 dollars for this depending on what version of this turd you got is simply wrong. This should be free at most. Listen to it on the loutallica site prior to purchase, I cannot stress that enough. Listen for free at how bad it is and hear what the delusional 5 star reviews are about. Some self proclaimed artistic folks here are giving this pile of atrocious nonsense free 5 star reviews like Halloween candy because it's Metallica and Lou reed.....Metallica having a legacy does not make lulu good, you buying anything Metallica or Lou reed releases does not make it good, you making excuses for this travesty does not make it good, Lars telling you it's good does not make it good, James telling you it's good does not make it good, and calling this art is an insult to what's left of human intelligence. Listen to it before you buy it, don't waste money on terrible music. For the hopeless fanboys that will buy anything tallica: Reguardless of in or outside the box this album is aweful. As a metal album it's laughable, as art it's a slap in the face and an insult to the word, as a colab rock album it's a miserable, pathetic failure, as a coaster it's depressing to look at, when in pieces it can cut you causing bleeding as your ears and heart should when you hear this pile of atrocious nonsense.

B005ELQVGW|5.0|At last Björk has mananged to make something lasting. This is her \\"Night of Hunters\\"; in many ways, it harks back to \\"Homogenic\\" (her masterpiece), but it also forges new ground. The brass of \\"Volta\\" makes an appearance, but it also has some of the more pensive and... well, different elements of \\"Drawing Restraint 9\\". Yes, some of the same things appear in \\"Volta\\", but they just managed to make the album feel uneven, like it didn't quite know what it wanted to be. On here, everything works towards the common goal.  \\"Moon\\" is probably one of the most wonderfully realised songs she's written in a long time, and a perfect introduction to the feeling of the album. And then you listen on and WHAM: \\"Virus\\", \\"Sacrifice\\", and \\"Mutual Core\\". These three are perhaps among the best songs she's ever written: \\"Virus\\" is outstandingly beautiful, \\"Sacrifice\\" starts off unassuming and then hits you, and \\"Mutual Core\\" just blows you away.  We seem to forget how few albums Björk has actually made; \\"Volta\\" was a fun album, with a dark edge, and yes it was uneven, but it was right after \\"Medulla\\", which probably her most interesting album, if also slightly uneven.  And then she produced this. \\"Biophilia\\" is her most modern and accomplished work. She's back, not that she ever really went away. Brilliant.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Ok, we all know this is not a TRUE Metallica album... it is more Lou Reed than Metallica and I really don't mind Reed, but how two talented people/groups can come together to release this is just mind blowing.   I have listened to Metallica since Re-Load came out, I was 10 at the time. I fell in love with them there, and of course after I heard the first 4 albums I was hooked. The only Studio releases from them I have been apart of are St. Anger and Death Magnetic, which I love. (Yes, I loved St. Anger) Now, like I mentioned above this is NOT a Metallica album... it's mostly stuff Lou Reed had and Metallica just added some music. This album on a scale of 1-10 is at least a -2. The only song I can attempt to like is \\"The View\\" because I like the flow of the music and how Reed's voice goes with the music. That being said, there is not another redeemable quality on this album except for some of the music, like on \\"The View\\", and \\"Mistress Dread\\". Other than those two, it just.....it sucks. I have never said anything with METALLICA on it and SUCKS in the same line. This is literally the first time for me.   Song by Song Breakdown-  1) Brandenburg Gate- Not much here to like. Starts with a slow acoustic opening that sounds nice, Reed sounds like an Indie version of Johnny Cash. Then comes Metallica in this slow tempo LOAD sounding music with Hetfield yelling \\"small town girl\\"..... and it just continues for the next 3 minutes... Reed just kinda talks throught the rest. Agonizing. 0/5  2) The View - The first, and probably only, single off this debacle. Starts with slow drums and a very nice riff  and Reed comes in very nicely here. It flows like this the rest of the song. Nice tempo changes. Hetfield does awesome here, I really dig this song. 4/5  P.S, I AM THE TABLE!  3) Pumping Blood - Starts with a violin type intro and bass beats from Lars. Some cool guitar work, then Lou Reed just rambles in like a drunk 15 year old that drank too much at karaoke talking about pumping blood for  the first minute and a half. I just find this song annoying. 1/5  4) Mistress Dread - Killer opening, guitar, and drum work. This could be a great METALLICA song.... but Lou Reed has no place in a fast paced song like this... it just doesn't fit at all. It plain out just doesn't sound good. 2/5 (For the music)  5) Iced Honey - Nice music again, not too terrible of a song overall. Lou sounds good with the music on this one, but it is still missing something. 2/5  6) Cheat on me -  It sucks. 1/5  7) Frustration - Same as every other song... slow intro (getting annoying now). Discombobulated music and singing.... At this point it is just getting hard not to laugh at this attempt \\"Spermless like a girl\\" LOL. 1/5  8) Little Dog -  Very slow song... not that bad really. Silly lyrics though, the thing that kills this song is its length. It would be a nice 4 1/2 minute song. Clocking in at over 8 minutes is just too much. 2/5  9) Dragon - Not too bad here either I dig toward the middle and end of the song but it's still weird.  2/5  10) Junior Dad - At this point if you can get through all 19 minutes of this song without skipping, be my guest. Frankly I haven't listened to the entire song because I am exhausted and don't believe it's any better than the rest of the other songs. But just from skimming it, there are ok music and alot of humming... I think I got the whole song down by saying that. 1/5  Total out of 50-  16. On a grading scale, that's a 32 or just an abysmal F-  It deserves one star. It really does. I challenge anyone to make it completely through this album and not cringe one time. I understand this is not a Metallica album, but they will be kicking themselves after just realeasing a brilliant album, Death Magnetic, just 3 years ago. Here is to the new Metallica sounding a ton better than this garbage.

B005FVFWOI|5.0|After realizing they pulled the Facebook link this morning, I went to Amazon and downloaded the 2 discs (25 songs!) for 9.49. The quality of the mix and separations are like those fantastic Beatles releases of a couple years ago. That they've restored the original album to it's former glory prior to the addition of those \\"bonus tracks\\" that to my mind only served to break up the continuity is exa...ctly the right move. Then the other disc is an additional 14 tracks of wonder including an early alternate of \\"My God\\" including the more controversial lyrics and so much more. I'm sitting here this morning listening to an incredible early version of \\"Wind Up\\" with tears in my eyes it's so clean and beautiful. It's like a time machine taking us back to 1971 to hear some of the best music ever made as it was originally meant to be heard along with additional material held back for all these years to comfort me in my old age. I cannot stress how wonderful this is to be listening on my headphones like this, \\"new\\" vintage Aqualung material here in 2011. Of course I will order the CD's for the kaboodle to go with the kit (what's another $17.51 for such treasure!?) but if all I get for my money is these 25 songs downloaded to my pc where I can listen to them on stereo headphones to my heart's content, this release has just made my year, perhaps my decade!
B000063DFN|5.0|What can I say about Powerslave that hasn't already been said? Not only is this my favorite Maiden album, its my favorite album of all time. Its the closest humanity has ever come to perfection. One day aliens will visit Earth and evaluate our intellect as a species. They won't be impressed with our architecture, electronic devices, scientific discovers, or mathematical equations. They'll consider our species primitive until one of those slimy green aliens listens to a copy of Powerslave. They'll then return to their home planet praising the virtues of humanity.  There's really no excuse for not owning this.
0811871258|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moNCH9USO4F2NJ]]Rebus is an exquisite book. Large format, trimmed pages with red edges, 240 pages thick.<br /><br />Rebus is a collection of James Jean's paintings, personal and commercial, from 2001 to 2011. In 2001, he was 21 and just graduated from art school. This book is very impressive considering how much he has achieved over the last 10 years.<br /><br />Some of his work which has appeared in other publications are now also collected here. There's nothing from [[ASIN:1401215769 Fables]] or his life sketches ([[ASIN:1935233033 The Hallowed Seam]]). There isn't much duplication overall.<br /><br />There are work from his Kindling exhibition. Some of them have appeared in the similarly titled poster-book [[ASIN:0811870391 Kindling]]. Then there are his personal works, commissioned work from Prada, the panorama illustrations that appeared in the accordion book Rift, some you might have seen on his website, some are published in the book for the first time.<br /><br />The illustrations are beautiful, haunting and inspiring at the same time. It's surrealism that's uniquely James Jean. These images are best seen than described. There are also some photos from his exhibition.<br /><br />I only have one minor quibble and that's regarding the presentation of his panorama illustrations that span 8 pages. They aren't printed as gatefold pages which is perhaps the most appropriate way to present them, and possibly the best way they should be seen.<br /><br />Rebus is an enthralling collection. Highly recommended for any James Jean fan.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)

0307477479|4.0|It's too bad \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" won a Pulitzer, because placing it in that level of writing makes it look weaker than it really is. Frankly, it was an enjoyable read, moved along well, and borders on greatness in its use of multiple narrative styles and perspectives. I absolutely loved the way in which the story was told, and as I finished up the already semi-famous \\"Power Point\\" chapter I felt like I might be reading a great book. Then the train went off the rails as it ventured into a dystopian future that simply wasn't believable. When I stepped back and began to break the book down category by category I found that its brilliant structure had covered up for an otherwise ordinary novel.<br /> That being said, what a structure it was! On that point alone, and for the emotional impact of the aforementioned Power Point chapter, A Visit from the Goon Squad is a must read.<br /><br />{{A word about \\"EQ\\" in the ratings below - I rank fiction books on a scale of zero to five stars in ten different categories. I then weigh those categories based on how important they are to the story being told, in my opinion. EQ simply means in this case \\"multiply by.\\" The total score is calculated in terms of a percentage and then translated into an overall star rating to fit with Amazon's rating system.}}<br /><br />PLOT (3 Stars out of 5 - EQ 2)<br /> Not much going on here, as Goon is not really a cohesive story so much as collected short episodes tied together by common characters and a common theme. The connections that are there are tied together fairly well. Within the short stories themselves the quality of the mini-plots are up and down, some being great (the opening chapter where we meet Sasha; the interview chapter) some being mediocre (any chapter involving Scotty).<br /><br />CHARACTERS  3 Stars out of 5 - EQ 4)<br /> Everything they should be with one exception - you never really care about them. This isn't to say every character should be loveable, but you should be emotionally drawn into their struggles. I was not, apart from the child characters who are vibrant and far more interesting than their respective parents.<br /><br />DIALOG  4 Stars out of 5 - EQ 4)<br /> Crisp and well done. While the dialog is good, the inner monolog of the various narrators during the first-person sequences are fantastic.<br /><br />STRUCTURE AND PACE  5 Stars out of 5 - EQ 4)<br /> Amazing, by far the best thing about the book and more likely than not the reason it won a Pulitzer. You would expect all the jumping,  from person to person and from time to time, to be more difficult to keep up with. However, the shifts in narrative perspective help to make these transitions work and each story tends to pivot off a (seemingly) minor character from the previous chapter. I would absolutely recommend this book based on this category alone.<br /><br />INGENUITY (4 Stars out of 5 - EQ 2)<br /> While many of the characters feel two-dimensional, the situations they find themselves in can be a riot! If the creative touches had extended all the way to the protagonists then this would merit five stars, not four.<br /><br />MOOD  4 Stars out of 5 - EQ 2)<br /> Ranging from zany to depressing to contemplative, this book covers an enormous range of moods, all of which are handled with a deft touch.<br /><br />FUNFACTOR  4 Stars out of 5 - EQ 2)<br /> I had a good time reading this book, mainly to see what narrative type would turn up next! This is yet another category where the lack of great characters kept the score at a four instead of a five.<br /><br />WEIGHT (3 Stars out of 5 - EQ 3)<br /> This is a book about discovering old age (or at least older age) and \\"dying\\" before you die. Sadly, while Egan is a terrific observer of the personal effects of mid-life crises, she has no more idea of what to do about them than her characters. When she does venture beyond the personal matters into large issues of the day, her attempts to weigh in strike me as exceedingly clumsy and badly thought out.<br /><br />PROSE  3 Stars out of 5 - EQ 1)<br /> For the most part, very clean and to the point. Nothing astonishing here, but nothing to complain about either.<br /><br />COMPARISON FACTOR  3 Stars out of 5 - EQ 4)<br /> If compared to books released in the last year, A Visit from the Goon Squad does quite well. However, when you broaden the scope out five to ten years or more, I think it becomes ordinary. It is not in the same league as previous winners such as March (2006) or The Road (2007), nor does it stand up well to the recent Man Booker winners, such as Wolf Hall.<br /><br />Total Score: 90/140 Points<br />65%<br />3 ½ Stars (Rounded up to 4 on Amazon's Scale)<br />In a Word: GoodNothing astonishing here, but nothing to complain about either.

B005NKBTS4|1.0|This is another Murphy translation(it seems there are a lot of these public domain versions popping up in the kindle store for some reason). It is 20% shorter than the full version of Mein Kampf which means a lot was cut out and it is full of well documented translation errors.   There are better translations out there so do some research before going for a cheap one. There is a reason it is cheap!  I do not recommend this or any Murphy translation of Mein Kampf. It distorts the meaning.
B004UXUWYM|2.0|I could describe the film The Rum Diary as a cinematic bipolar disorder that ignites a collective audience attention deficit disorder as your mind drifts to wonder what else is playing on the other screens in this theatre that I could justify already spending my 40 bucks for me and my date (and that's even sharing one popcorn, one soda and one box of junior mints).<br /><br />Having read the The Rum Diary, albeit years ago, I had extremely low expectations for this film.  It being one of Hunter's earliest works, he was only just beginning to find his voice, rhythm and style.  Yet the book is worth reading as it marks his writing with a promising sign of the amazing work to come.  So upon hearing that Hollywood would be attempting an adaptation, I thought...omg, why?  Not only did I think there was not enough in the book to make much of a cinematic journey (or story) but also I had the gut feeling the film would fall short of it.  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Terry Gilliam is about as good as it's going to get (as Thompson was still around to make sure of it).<br /><br />Hunter S. Thompson the man was bigger than life, an amazing character already...can't touch him...and his writing is the man's mind, heart and soul on paper, so you can't touch that.  Your best bet is to watch him in the documentary Breakfast with Hunter by Wayne Ewing (I own it and show it to my students each semester).  In the doc, you see him, hear him, and know that if he was around to see this film he'd meet and greet audiences with either his shotgun or fire extinguisher (not to mention the god-awful things he would do to the studio).<br />Other than that, I recommend reading the words he wrote on the page.  Your own imagination will fill in any gaps better than Hollywood ever could despite the excellent performances by its cast.  Nevertheless, as I tell my filmmaking students, seeing the bad movies have value as you learn what not to do.<br /><br />I rate it with a \\"rent it\\" sign.<br /><br />SWT 11/01/11

B004Y6MU6S|5.0|Where most fantasy novels are either semi-historical (most of Song of Fire and Ice) or Tolkin-like (elves and orcs, I could name dozens), Brandon Sanderson has created a truly unique world with this book.  The uniqueness starts with the weather, and flows through to the flora and fauna, architecture, and even magic system and political structure.  The characters are all complex and believable.  My only nervousness is about how long I'm going to have to wait for another 9 books of this size to come out.
B004YEJGEO|3.0|I wish there was a way to swap the prism status between split and combine.  Frequently I run into situations where the game simply will not allow me to place the prism and have it behave properly.  I haven't been able to get past 6-2, NOT because I don't see the solution, but because the game won't actually combine the lasers properly.  Otherwise, the game is challenging and enjoyable.
B0033PQUXA|5.0|This is probably my favorite film of all time. It's been out for years and most of you have probably seen it, so I'm not going to review the movie itself, just the Blu-ray. First of all, it's a very nice print. The film finally looks like it should. At times it gets grainy in the low light shots, but it's a twenty year old film and considering that it really does look great. I've been waiting for this film to come out on Blu-ray for years and it is a treat to see it in all its glory since I missed it in theaters.<br /><br />Thankfully, this is the original theatrical release. The extended version is not included and personally I'm thankful for that. I'm still trying to wipe the stain of it from my mind a decade after first viewing it. No extras on this Blu-ray at all. I would have paid a hundred bucks to own this on Blu-ray and for ten dollars it's a must buy.<br /><br />I only have one issue with this release. It seems to me that Alfredo's voice was dubbed over in this version. It's still in Italian and this seems like an odd choice to me. It was noticeable enough to really take me away from the movie. I don't remember that being the case for the VHS or the DVD versions, but it's been a few years since I last viewed the film so I could be wrong. Still, a wonderful film that should not be missed, and is also a treasure to revisit.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|i'm gutted that coldplay is changing their style of music. i'm not a blind fan who follows their favorite artist to failure without sitting back and realizing what's happening.  I miss the old songs by coldplay and i feel as if coldplay is trying to become more mainstream which truly saddens me because i loved them as they were, they're older albums are timeless. However this is still coldplay and they deserve nothing less than 4 star and still better that 95% of the crap that's out right now. I'm sorry to say that old coldplay might be gone :(
B003L77G6A|3.0|I have been a die hard BBT fan since episode one.  I have always found the relationship between the characters unique, and the chemistry that comes from watching Penny interact with these super nerdy brainiacs has always been what makes the show great.  The show has always been about how odd the guys are, and how when interacting with Penny, a very normal, popular socialite, shows just how out of phase these guys are.  With season 4, they interrupted all that, gave everyone girlfriends and that greatly upset that chemistry.  My main gripe is with Pria.  She drove a wedge between Penny and Leonard, banning them from almost even talking, that did more damage to the show than anything else.  Suddenly there was no more chemistry, no more watching the nerds justify their odd habits, no more watching them do odd things and call it fun, but suddenly it was boys against the girls.    With season 4, the show has lost something.  I found myself no longer passing video links of what happened on the show around the net to my friends, no more Sheldon quotes, no more laughing with my friends over what happened.  They tried to do too much too fast, and in return, they hurt the show.  Such a major disappointment actually, this season was a major let down.  Towards the end of the season, I was making myself watch it, and not eagerly watching.    I hope future episodes are better, but it is no longer what it once was.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|I really like this calendar,  but wish it had a scrollable widget.  The TINY arrow buttons at the bottom of the widget are way too small to press to switch between days/weeks/months,  etc. If it had the scrollability of the GO Calendar Widget it would be a 5 star easily.
1423140591|5.0|It's rare to find the second part of a series superior to te first.  It's even rarer for a second series to be so much more than the first.  Rick Riordan has done both.  This was easily one of m favorite books from his collection.  It includes interesting characters, a solid plot and one of the best supporting casts.  The reintroduction of Percy wasn't stale in the slightest.  In fact it echoed parts of the first time we ever met Percy while still building on what we already knew of him.  I'm definitely ridiculously excited for the third book and how we'll discover what happens to this new quest where everyone will have to get along or die.
B000068TPN|5.0|I bought this movie after seeing parts of it on tv.

B0052TDGQO|5.0|Clear As Day by Scotty McCreery.  An album worth buying and paying for. I bought this album from Amazon and delivery was fast.    All the songs are so beautifully sung in that clear and deep voice that I am hearing it all day long and never getting tired of them.  The songs took me down memory lane, pulled my heartstrings, make me happy and young again.  You kinda have a feeling that the songs are about you and the singing is for you alone.  This is one of a kind album.  I strongly recommend people to buy it and feel the magic, the singer is bringing forth.  - from Malaysia

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|As the Great Recession was finally ending (at least formally) I discussed with an economist friend of mine the possibility that the unemployment situation was structural and not cyclical.  I felt this was important because the policy prescription would be different if it were the former more than the latter.  This book ties it all together, explaining the impact of information technology on how we do work, and how it has affected wages and unemployment.  Can we adapt quickly enough?  For a country interested in the OWS and the 99%, this is an important read.

B005FVA3LK|5.0|Just got this in the mail and within seconds of browsing through it I was speechless.  The CD options are phenomenal, the DVD's are well-chosen as a representation of the band's journey and almost complete anihilation through the recording of one of the best rock and roll albums of all time, and the book is, quite simply, amazing.  Stories of the entire creative process from conception to execution of Achtung Baby are peppered throughout amazing photography, giving fans a never-before-seen look inside the making of one of the best rock and roll albums of all time.  But what took my breath away was a photo of the actual page that \\"One\\" was written on - something so simple and yet so crucial to the entire direction of the album, and honestly when I read through it I felt like I was being handed a gift by the band.  Amazing.  Updated: I realized that in my excitement over the book that I unfairly left out the quality of the disks themselves.  Here's the skinny - the original Achtung Baby and Zooropa are obviously nothing new, and for hardcore fans who collected all of the singles the disk full of B-sides really isn't either.  But, as another review stated, \\"Kindergarten\\", or the demo cd of Achtung Baby, is really quite the listening experience.  It was cool getting to hear the development of the music, and for the truly hardcore fans there's plenty of Bongolese throughout most of the songs.  The acoustic version of \\"One\\" gave me goosebumps, and I loved the arrangement on \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\" and actually thought it was better than the finished product, although it's definitely raw.  The mix CDs are fun as well, so long as you don't take them too seriously.  With regards to the DVD selection while I haven't watched them all yet I think that they're an entirely fair representation of the band during the early 90's.  I personally only have the Sydney VHS so for me, at least, it was nice to upgrade to the DVD. The documentary \\"From the Sky Down\\" is a big deal because U2 is known for being extremely private and closed when it comes to who they allow into their inner sanctum, and to get that inside view as, ironically, a fly on the wall, is something that I definitely enjoyed ever minute of.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Today's marketers are incorrectly persistent in investing on traditional marketing methods to generate the leads that ultimately drive the company's sales; advertising, telemarketing, cold calling, seminars, trade shows and e-mail blasts tend to retain most of their marketing budget. However, these channels are all designed to push out the company's message hoping that it somehow reaches their prospects, and thus have customer disruption as common factor. With more than 2,000 outbound marketing interruptions per day, the average human is desperately looking to evade them through the usage of caller ID's and email filters.   In opposite, marketing strategies should be intended to naturally attract customers to the company and its products/services, through an engaging and \\"likeable\\" Social Media strategy. In his \\"Likeable Social Media\\" book, Dave Kerpen walks readers through a thought-provoking, worth-sharing and engaging journey on how traditional marketing communications in which companies could control what was being said about their brand and products evolved into a more transparent, customer based environment, where highly informed consumers' word of mouth and advocacy are the companies' most desired treasure.  @JuanCamLondono  As a marketer, I always try to find the unique selling proposition to be offered, in order to create competitive advantage and outstand from the competition. In that sense, I think that \\"Likeable Social Media\\" excels for its storey telling approach on the matter, in which Dave Kerpen effectively combines easy-to-digest and free of technical jargon theory with real life expertise to engage you not only as a reader, but as an adept of Social Media. Dave's proposition of value centers on listening to costumers, taking action, surprising and delighting; where becoming a real and authentic friend of your customers and focusing on making them feel appreciated and valued is what in the end makes the difference between a simple Facebook \\"like\\" and a loyal, long-term customer.  As Chief Marketing Officer for a petroleum retailing industry, I thought that generating relevant and engaging content for my customers was almost impossible. Now I know that by just being 100% transparent and genuinely caring about the people that every day put their trust on my product to fill their tanks I can start building and strengthening our relationship.

B004LWZW7E|3.0|Tempus fugit, bro. The movie title is lame but the premise is nifty and thought-provoking. I had to double check to make sure that Philip K. Dick didn't write this. But, no, Andrew Niccol penned the story and then shrugged and directed it, as well. Sometime in the near future, some messed up genius has figured out a way to genetically engineer the human body to halt the aging process once it attains 25 years. The catch is that once you reach 25, you're left with only a year to live. A digital clock activates on your forearm, begins to count down your last year of living. Except that there's a method by which you can add time to your body clock. In a world in which time has become currency, you can work for it, get paid in increments of  time. You can choose to barter an hour of your life for ten minutes of heaven with a lady of the evening. A call on a pay phone costs one minute, a bus ride an hour. In this reality, \\"Tempus fugit\\" has a horrific connotation.<br /><br />One way to ascertain class status is by how leisurely or frantically someone is going about their business. In the ghetto district inhabited by Will Salas (Timberlake), people frequently eye their built-in clocks, frequently run during their errands. In the ghetto, people don't have time to kill, but they will murder for time. If you get caught napping, thieves can literally steal time from you. When the puzzled heiress wonders how people in the ghetto live like this, Will remarks, \\"People don't much sleep in.\\" Phrases such as \\"Don't waste my time\\" or \\"Do you have a minute?\\" take on whole new breadths of meaning.<br /><br />In this new world order, the gulf dividing the haves and have-nots has expanded exponentially. The rich can simply amass centuries' worth of time and, in essence, become immortal whereas the poverty-stricken desperately scramble to earn enough time to make it thru the day, sometimes thru the next hour. Will Salas is 28 years old (or \\"25 + 3\\"). When a mysterious man (Matt Bomer) bequeathes Will Salas his century of life and then promptly commits suicide - in the parlance of the day, he \\"times out\\" - Will is suspected of murdering his benefactor. Because who would give away a century of life? Enter Cillian Murphy as the relentless head Timekeeper, the near future's version of law enforcement.<br /><br />What do you do when you suddenly have a hundred years' worth of time? You skedaddle from the ghetto and crash New Greenwich, where the influential and the deep pockets dwell, is what. We track Will Salas' arc as he goes from ghetto factory worker to determined outlaw, fighting to effect a change. A key component to his transformation is his brush with Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), the sheltered 27-year-old (\\"25 + 2\\") daughter of New Greenwich's wealthiest business mogul. (There's an even more crucial development which fuels Will's anti-establishment rage, but that might really be spoilering it - but you'll see it coming.) Sylvia Weis is one of them idle rich kids what has bodyguards trailing her, and she suffers from sheer ennui brought about by a lifetime bout of entitlement. You can imagine that spark of interest when she set eyes on Will, someone trying to blend - but not quite making it - into her rarified universe. The story applies an age-old plot device to throw Will and Sylvia together. Throw in the Timekeepers, and Will's decision to go down that dark road, and things suddenly take a Bonnie & Clyde turn but with a Robin Hood twist.<br /><br />Carpe tempus, or something. Will's crusade to parcel out time to those in need has unintended consequences. He didn't plan on the lowlifes to start preying on those what just got free time handed to them. And, to play devil's advocate, it turns out, there's a checks and balances system in play. With immortality achievable, overpopulation is stringently kept at bay by the government's continuous price hikes and the taxes reflect this. Places like the ghettos are heavily impacted; the death toll evens the scales. So how righteous is Will's cause, really? His mantra is \\"Is it stealing if it's already stolen?\\" But maybe it sounds a bit too self-serving.<br /><br />In this one Justin Timberlake isn't as locked in as he was in THE SOCIAL NETWORK, but he still has that big presence. IN TIME is a high concept sci-fi thriller, except that it knows that it's high concept. The metaphors fly thick and obvious. The allegory is transparent. The story is approached in a heavy-handed way. Timberlake and Seyfried are good together, but this is in spite of some laborious dialogue. So part of the film dragged for me. But there came a time when Amanda Seyfried's character was finally allowed to step out of her bored shell. Timberlake, scalp and jawline stubbled like all good action heroes should, does pretty well with the action sequences. All these nice good elements convince me to rate this sucker a better than average 3 out of 5 stars. It'd be higher but for those slow bits to slog thru and that whiff of stuffiness and that there isn't one truly knock-it-out-of-the-park moment in the film (although Timberlake and Pettyfer's time duel in the swanky hotel room comes close). So go. Carpe Fandango, or something.ns the scales. So how righteous is Will's cause, really?

B005D51JQQ|1.0|Sting is one of my all time favorites. Everybody knows that he is not your average dumb musician. He's got money to pay for at  least several thousand airplane rides to and from the rainforest. 3 CDs and a VERY SHORT EDITED concert DVD for over $100??? Are you kidding me? Why not just charge $5,000 for it? Or maybe $49,000??? The Nirvana Box Set is $120 for 4 CDs and 1 FULL CONCERT DVD, and that is probably a bit overpriced, but at least it includes some rare material. The  U2 Achtung Baby Box Set has 6 CDs, and 4 DVDs for $130. It looks like U2 is the best priced among the 3 box sets by far. The material? All solo Sting stuff. Instead of remastering individual albums, just a few of his best tracks. B Sides like \\"Another Day\\" remain unreleased unless you count a live version on a live album. This is just way too expensive to justify purchase. If the used price goes to under $50, you can count me in. At $50.01, I am sad to admit I'm a Sting fan. It would seem he would understand the stupidity of releasing such a sad release for so much money during a global recession. This release deserves 5 stars for the music, but around negative 100 stars for the price. Come On Sting, you can't be this greedy can you? Or have you gone bonkers at age 60?

B000M341RI|5.0|Long time since I viewed this movie and it brought back a lot of memories of great laughs and cammeraderie.  Would recommend it to everyone, great British humour at it's best, championing adversity.  We all need a little humour in our lives to get us through the bad times and this movie certainly lifts your spirits.  Enjoy and put a smile on your face.
0385344325|1.0|I thought it was a lame plot, farfetched, strained, forced, artificial, unrealistic, and a little hard to follow at times. The tempo of the read dragged and it was boring and choppy until the closing scenes. To me, Reacher's character was degraded in the book, especially at the climax, exhibiting a somewhat shallow person, not the wholesome heroic nature of the earlier Reacher character I was accustomed to. Maybe the series has run its string.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this as a gift, it is still in the wrapper, so nobody has heard it yet. But, we know it will be wonderful because we already love several of the songs.

B000TGJ8CQ|1.0|Too many others have pointed out the incredible holes in the plot (how is Cage's two-minute window supposed to help anyone, and how did she find out about him in the first place), so I'll just say that I ended up wishing I hadn't watched this film and wasted 90 minutes of my life.  There's no real purpose here, no real sense of the filmmakers having anything in mind other than putting out a movie with lots of supposed action, without any real attention given to details or characters.  One thing I haven't seen mentioned is the absolutely ridiculous idea that anyone can pass by the Grand Canyon on their way to Flagstaff from Vegas.  To get to the Havasupai village they visit, one has to drive an hour out of the way, then hike ten miles to get to the town (there are no roads to it).  There are no hotels on the edge of the canyon, and no village.  This is just lazy filmmaking, to go along with a ridiculous plot that depends on unrealistic characters doing stupid things.  And the \\"twist\\" at the end is not just silly, but it's actually rather insulting.  This is easily one of my least favorite films of the last few years.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Ellefson's return is very apparent, and it's definitely what makes this album worth it in the long end. The most impressive songs are \\"Deadly Nightshade\\", \\"13\\" and \\"Black Swan\\". If this was lost from my collection I would go out and instantly buy it again, because Megadeth is like a drug, except that it doesn't kill you. I also want to mention that Johhny K has done an excellent job producing this. This album picks up right from where Endgame left off and takes it to the next level. The cover resembles Vic Rattlehead, long time mascot, walking away, there's pictures on Vic's funeral inside the CD, 13 songs about how Mustaine is killing himself by playing music, hopefully it certainly won't be his last.<br /><br />It's only write to give this album a 13 out of 5 stars, Though it isn't like their classic album, I think it's nearly as good as Rust in Peace, I definitely prefer this enjoy the record, buy it don't pirate it! We want this to hit the charts over the abomination that is \\"Lulu\\" so justice can be served!
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Anthrax' return to the metal scene is a most welcomed one, considering they're one of the pioneers of the thrash scene. Worship Music is hands down an absolutely solid metal album with no frills. Just balls to the wall in yer face old school metal. In my opinion that's just whats needed in this 'sad state of music' era. Stand out tracks include - Fight em, Devil you know (the 2 singles) as well as 'I'm alive, Revolution, Crawl, In the end'. Good to have em back at what they do best.

0767817664|5.0|My second favorite Vampire film of all time! \\"Fright Night\\" (the original) is the perfect blend of scares & laughs, as Charlie (William Ragsdale) believes his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) is a Vampire, after seeing Jerry & his roommate, Billy, carrying a coffin in to the cellar, through an outside cellar door. Murders have been happing around town with the victims head cut off, & Charlie is determined to prove he knows who the killer is, his neighbor.<br /><br />Chris Sarandon puts on a marvelous performance as the Vampire, Jerry Dandrige. He is smooth, intelligent, aristocratic, has a sense of humor, & exudes loads of sexuality, like most great Vampires, male or female. There is an underlying aura of menace, to his demeanor, very subtle, but all the more powerful for it . He is a cat silently stalking it's prey, sleek, graceful, & lethal.<br /><br />Charley is perfect for his role, as the prying, upstanding, though slightly inept high school boy, trying to convince everyone that Jerry is a Vampire. His friend, the scene stealing, Evil Ed, (Stephen Geoffreys, who pursued a porno star career afterwards) tells Charley all he needs to know about Vampires, for $8.00, LOL. He tells Charley his best protection right now is not to invite a Vampire in to his house, as a Vampire can not enter another's home, unless invited, so Charley feels relatively safe until his mothers calls him downstairs to meet his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige, to Charley's horror! The tension of this scene is so real it's almost physical.<br /><br />Charley finally goes to horror movie host/actor Peter Vincent, \\"Vampire Killer,\\" in desperation of someone to believe him, & is met with the same skepticism as all the others. Peter Vincent, played by Roddy McDowall, is the complete opposite of Chris Sarandon's, Jerry Dandrige. Bumbling, inept, cowardice, played with all the conviction of non-conviction this fine actor can muster! Peter Vincent is a major ingredient to why this film works so well, as he is finally bribed by Charley's girlfriend to help prove that Charley is wrong about Jerry Dandrige being a Vampire, in another tense scene.<br /><br />Peter Vincent adds the comedic element to this film, along with Evil Ed, & it is quite the performance, as Peter Vincent finds out Jerry is a Vampire, turns tail & runs, then later finds the courage within himself to help Charley in trying to destroy Jerry Dandrige.<br /><br />\\"Fright Night,\\" easily has some of the best make up & special effects for any horror film of the 80's, especially a female Vampire with a gaping maw, filled with razor sharp teeth. It helped set a standard for Vampire's appearances to this day. Not just blood shot eyes & fangs, but a metamorphosis, not unlike land mark Werewolf film's, \\"An American Werewolf in London\\" & \\"the Howling. \\"Fright Night\\" can make a pretty air tight claim to the Vampire sub-genre, that those films did for the Werewolf sub-genre. It can also stand along with those films as one of the best examples of it's ilk, a modern updating of the Vampire film legacy, even though we have \\"the Boy Who Cried Wolf\\" plot, seldom has it been done so convincingly well! Scary, & funny, all at once!<br /><br />For Vampire lovers with a sense of humor, you can't go wrong with \\"Fright Night,\\" it's laughs & scares are one seamless perfection!

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|If you can't put a butterfly in a jar, then you can't put Lou Reed and Metallica in the studio together and come up with anything worth listening to. LuLu is a chore. While listening you are hoping for all of this to end. Yet there are two cd's worth of this stuff.<br />I have made it through the entire thing in one sitting and did not feel that great afterwards. Now, going back and listening again, it really does not improve at all.<br />There are sparse sections where things are tolerable and actually sound good. Yet, they are far and few between. What seems like a good idea ends up being quite a bad move.<br />I wonder if Hetfield was instructed to sing bad. His singing is lacking and makes me cringe. A lot of Reed's words are ridiculous and just bad and offensive. Some have said that one must understand the philosophy and historic background that Reed uses for the basis of this work. This makes it seem more legitimate yet, I think instead Mr. Reed has taken a very free adaptation of the story trying to set it in a current context. But it comes out more nihilistic than anything I have heard in a very long time. If you need to research something out before listening, then it is not a very practical piece os music.<br /> This is not the first time that the story of Lulu has been set to music. If you want something far better and much more interesting get the recording of Twentieth Century composer Alban Berg's opera Lulu.<br /><br />Edit - 11/2/11<br />Lou Reed referenced two literary German Expressionist works for this. When he repeats Jack in the song Pumping Blood it is a reference to Jack the Ripper who is part of the original stories. Not that this info makes any difference to the listening experience. And understand also Lou Reed's ramblings are from the female characters point of view. Be that as it may. RIP
B005MNXYQM|5.0|The girl who waited - is one of my FAVS in the 2nd half of season 6. Amy goes through so much depth and we learn a bit more about her on this ride. It's emotional and moving ... well done Karen! I watched this one 3 times before the next episode.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I really enjoyed the trials and tribulations of Thomas, as he entered the Glade and started learning about the maze and the maze runners. I liked the creative and imaginative world Dashner had created in his book. The grievers, the Beatle-spies, the moving walls and everything else. But I also enjoyed the thorough character building that was going on and the inter relationships of the Gladers. I loved to discover Albi, Newt, Chuck, Gally et al. At the end of the book, with one question solved, I got left with a few new ones, so I went ahead and ordered the next book in the series right away and I am looking forward to reading it.<br /><br />Note: I had it downloaded as an audio book from audible and loved the narration.

B000002KGT|5.0|\\"Rumours\\" #1 (1977).  This album has sold over 17 million copies since 1977.  This is pure California pop-rock at it's best.    You get,  Lindsey Buckingham's \\"Second Hand News\\", \\"Never Going Back Again\\",  \\"Go Your Own Way\\" #10 and \\"The Chain\\" (co-written with the rest of the band).  Stevie Nicks wrote some fine tracks in, \\"Dreams #1, \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" (sung with Lindsey).  And Christine McVie gives us, \\"Don't Stop #3, \\"Songbird\\", \\"You Make Loving Fun\\" #9 and \\"Oh Daddy\\" all excellent pop songs.  Every song has been played on F.M. rock stations for the last 34 years.  1977 was a great year for music, I was a Junior in High School and my top 10 that year was:  10. Pink Floyd - Animals     9.  Meat Loaf - Bat Out Of Hell  8.  Eric Clapton - Slowhand  7.  Steve Miller Band - Book Of Dreams  6.  Foreigner - Foreigner  5.  Gerry Rafferty - City To City  4.  Thin Lizzy - Bad Reputation  3.  Fleetwood Mac - Rumours  2.  Blue Oyster Cult  -  Spectres  1.  Electric Light Orchestra  -  Out Of The Blue
B005CKPQHA|4.0|I have not missed a single episode since I discovered this show. I like the story and a lot of conflicts between family members and each of the characters have to face their own problems. One thing I do not quite understand is Walt's wife. She kinda walked away from Walter after Walt told him about the drug business and cheated on Walter and later filed divorce, because she donot want to use the money earned from drug business. Her attitude to Walt changed dramatically. BUT why did not she change back her attitude after she joined the business too? I think she own Walt an apology.

Lindsey Buckingham really stars on this, great guitar work.

This album harkens back to the \\"Rumours\\" material, I really like this album, I think a lot of people really don't care for this release.  We get 4 perfect Christine McVie songs, \\"Love In Store\\" #22 hot 100, a perfect pop song, \\"Only For You\\", \\"Hold Me\\" #4 hot 100 and #3 MSR and the grand closing tune \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  We also get 5 great Buckingham songs in \\"Empire State\\", \\"Eyes  Of The World\\", \\"Oh Diane\\" #35 AC, \\"Can't Back\\" and \\"Book Of Love\\" (they should of released this as a single).  And Stevie Nicks gave them 3 excellent songs \\"Gypsy\\" #12 hot 100 and #4 MSR, \\"That's Alright\\" and \\"Straight Back\\" #36 MSR.  As I said before this album needs a good remastering.

I saw it twice in theaters, and dragged my boyfriend to see it with me, he said he really didn't want to watch a stupid chick-flick but ended up loving it and said it was \\"a movie worth buying.\\" I think its hysterical, has a great twist at the end, and shows many different love stories from different age groups. And I just love Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Emma Stone! Loved it!
B005KQVDH8|4.0|Given: this movie is already great.  Review is on the single disk blu ray quality only.  Pros:  Very decent HD picture.  Some scenes pretty grainy, some scenes super crisp in Blu, good for an old film.  Cons:  Some digital artifacts through out that the average joe might not ever notice, making me wonder if the film masters were really rescanned to achieve the purest HD and just over compressed in the single disc version... it does not appear to be an upconversion of the old dvd source materials like the first release of the Stargate Blu-Ray that was panned.  On the other hand, film grain is natural in filmography, or on purpose like in the apollo 13 blu disc to achieve the vintage look.  It also appears on various scenes that some of the optics in the filmography was a bit odd, being focused in the center but distorted at a certain radius.  No brainer for $10. Enjoy.
0345529057|5.0|I love reading novels by series; I don't have to learn new characters in each book.  That's why I purchased this set.  I have not been disappointed. I like the way the author split up the story by character chapters.  The characters are live, real and sometimes I've felt the need to stop reading because I just knew something awful was going to happen in the story line, and I wasn't ready to read about it yet!  I've skipped sections just to find out what happens to a particular character (or two!).  The book seems to read itself.  Totally enjoyable and highly recommended, at least by me...!  :)
B004G25V9S|3.0|Opeth and their absolutely impenetrably rock solid discography have earned themselves a good amount of faithful apostles. Similar to Mastodon, their fans generally consider the band untouchable, as they're on their 10th record and have never managed to create an album which does not progress or in some way help to further their sound towards (idealistically) the goal of creating the perfect album. With all the talk surrounding this album coming from frontman (and overall lead director, I guess?) Mikhail Akerfeldt, one would get the sense that creatively, Opeth have made their magnum opus, the album which would define and justify everything they have ever done and ever will do.   However this, very unfortunately, is not the case. What we have instead is rather a problem child of an Opeth album, one that will likely cause a divide between fans. As this time around Akerfeldt et al have ditched the death metal, and made a straight up, honest to Fripp, old school Progressive Rock album. Strange guitar effects, filthy organs, jazzy drums and odd time signatures galore. It's the album that you could just tell Akerfeldt was aching to make the second that funky keyboard interlude appeared in The Lotus Eater off of 2008s Watershed. And to be fair, we can't really deny him it. With a discography as strong as Opeth's it would be well within Akerfeldt's rights as an artist to start covering Lady Gaga and join her in producing club ready bubble gum pop. So why the divide? It's clear that this is a record Akerfeldt has been wanting to make since the first time he listened to In the Court of the Crimson King, why don't we just let him have this one?  I'm being perhaps a bit patronizing. Do not get me wrong, this is a solid album. The production hits the nail right on the head in terms of it's vintage sound. Per Wiberg's organ and snyths are the perfect flourish and do a lot to capture the classic prog feel, as does Martin Axenrot's jazzy as hell drumming. Though I'm sure a good contribution to the authenticity of this sound comes from Steven Wilson and his encyclopedic knowledge of Progressive Rock. Though the change is on the surface quite a major one, there are also still quite a few of the common Opeth atmospheric traits found here. The quite folky interludes remain, as do the haunting grand piano segments, and the riffing is as intricate and groovy as ever. This still essentially sounds like an Opeth album.   However most of the tracks on here lack the absolutely masterful structure that typical Opeth compositions feature, structures which Akerfeldt has perfected to a point over time. Often sacrificed for more spontaneous and colorful arrangements. While I see the reasons for this departure of this particular trait, I must say that I am rather mournful of it, and perhaps preferred their past methods of songwriting.   Overall I suppose this album simply isn't as grand as the usual Opeth output. However it definitely keeps from stagnation, and while it might not be their best record, I give kudos to them for knowing what they're perhaps too good at, and having the balls to stray away from it. So as to prevent becoming another Metallica, or Judas Priest, consistently churning out the same records, digging their own proverbial grave. This album is a consolation, and a promise, that no matter what Opeth will be doing, people will be listening.

B005HS00NW|5.0|Three reactions are generally prompted upon the mention of M83--\\"Mehh..\\" \\"alshkjsbngsnvkbjv!!!!!!!!!!!\\" or \\"BLARRGGHHH!!!!:@:@:@@@!\\". Most of his records (with the exception of his widely regarded debut) generally tend to stir the pot in terms of where fans place their allegiance. Even to this day, about this very album I have heard everything from the `glowing gift from heaven'-type praises to other downright scathing reviews. And it really isn't fair, because if we look at this project objectively, whether you find yourself pleased with the outcome or not, no one can deny that Anthony Gonzalez is making some of the biggest music out there.     He's the warm fuzzy anthemic head of the electronic world. And on this new release, he lets it all loose. Chant-a-long oh oh oh's, bubbly nostalgia, sweeping choruses, and voice-over pieces slathered in melodrama. It's so jampacked with all this cheese that I'm sure this generation will be remembered for, but rather than coming off as if Gonzalez were making some kind of Indie-Rock-Electronic checklist, it's altogether much more sincere than that. As the cover art might suggest; this album is very much an ode to a lost childhood. As romanticized as it all is, there's an indescribable yearning to each melody and texture that rings true to the sting of human nostalgia. Everything in this record feels pertaining to a very specific time and place. Every corner enchants and inspires some sense of magic in the listener.     It is noteworthy too how significantly Gonzalez has really grown musically. Continuing on from Saturdays=Youth's trade in of desert wide cinema-scopes a lá Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts for lush pop landscapes. Not only is he taking advantage of his own pop sensibilities but he has splattered it on such a massive canvas that he utilizes his past scope to execute it. Which results in a perfect blend of his various musical stylings. It's worth mentioning too that Anthony Gonzalez is really showing off hispipes on this one. Swooning and belting out notes like his life depended on it, so much so that on the intro with Zola Jesus, it is almost difficult to distinguish the two.     This being Gonzalez' first double album, he doesn't stray too far from the tried and true formula, but that's not to say he doesn't make it his own. The melodies are all executed with precision, the aesthetic is focused but not restrictive, and the structures are dynamic as ever. The disc's mirror each other quite well; each has an Intro and Outro track, 3 interludes, 1 dynamic ballad and the rest is filled with alluring dancefloor glamour and glitz. Each disc clocks in at around 36 minutes, making for an overall running time of 1hr 13mins. Although I must admit I was expecting a slightly longer running time (a solid 90 minutes would have been nice maybe?), however 73 minutes is in no way a cop out.     I can see (and have seen) a lot of people on the fence about this one, perhaps put off by all the cheese, but there is an earnestness so deeply embedded in Gonzalez' latest offering that I honestly don't ever remember hearing in past M83 records. This record goes places that his previous releases only hinted at, and you really do get enraptured in actually being there. This isn't an album to simply listen to, or even experience, but rather to marvel at.    (...)
B005J29HCQ|5.0|The product of a drug addled genius imploding, the greatest lost album in rock music, a smorgasbord of styles and content so varied it makes your head ache but your heart leap and a tale of ambition so big no studio could hope to contain it. The Beach Boys resident modern day Mozart has of course previously let the cat out of the bag on this music with his truly lovely 2004 \\"Brian Wilson presents Smile\\" where the compositional dreams of completely inspired 24 year old imbued with the lyrical preoccupations of the slightly less mad Van Dyke Parks, were finally reconstituted by more reflective composer in his early sixties. Some Beach Boys fans might argue that the 2004 rework fully did the job (scoring an unprecedented 97 on Metacritic reviews) but others have never ceased to harbor deep longing for the base metal of the original sessions on official release despite the fact that this must be one of the most available bootlegs in musical history.<br /><br />\\"Smile\\" was the product of Wilson being locked away in 1966-67 in the small Studio One at Sunset Sound in Hollywood. His behavior by this time was erratic at best and his emotional state increasingly volatile. The pressure of following Pet Sounds and the sheer earth shaking impact of the Beatles \\"Sgt Pepper\\" literally spun him out of control and impacted on a man whose mental health was rapidly degenerating and which would spiral into a prolonged acid induced psychological hell.  All this is captured in graphic detail in Wilson's own enthralling yet excruciatingly painful autobiography \\"Wouldn't it be nice\\" and \\"Smile\\" was primary architect of his near destruction.<br /><br />That was then and this is now. As of today \\"The Smile Sessions\\" will be issued in three versions: as a two-CD set; and in a box set with four CDs, two vinyl LPs, two vinyl singles and a 60-page book. For Beach boys obsessives this is manna from heaven and you can spend as much time as you require in the second disc bumping around the studio with Wilson as he fiddles, twiddles and constructs. But what of the main act of this album that stretches in suites from \\"Our Prayer\\" to \\"Good Vibrations\\"? The format followed here by producers Mark Linett and Alan Boyd is essentially that of the 2004 Smile Sessions. The remastering is pristine and even after the umpteenth listen you are reminded that on occasions Brian Wilson could musically balance on mercury. No offence to the \\"later Wilson\\" of 2004 but its also the case that the sweetness of vocals on the original and the alchemy of the \\"group\\" harmonies make this an extra special deal. The great \\"Cabin Essence\\" while perhaps not as powered up as the 2004 version remains the great unheralded Beach Boys song. When followed with \\"Wonderful\\" it is a killer double pairing. Those who love \\"Heroes and Villains\\" are completely overwhelmed for choice with the original, a very nice stereo mix and at least five other works in progress or variants. With the sublime \\"Surfs Up\\" you get the god like genius of the original plus an instrumental and a gorgeous take piano take which is an absolute standout. Quite what new can be said of Good Vibrations other than to gasp in shock and awe. Granted \\"Vega -tables\\" and \\"Barnyard\\" will either completely charm or irritate but \\"Mrs O'Learys cow\\" remains the Beach boys \\"Day in the life\\" with its frightening swirling dark force and one can only picture the horror on Mike Love's face when this was first played back.<br /><br />Listening again to \\"Smile\\" confirms that the obsessive Wilson could never perfectly transpose the noise or the demons inside his head to a finished product. It also shows that it nearly killed him trying. In terms of the earlier Beatles comparison this reviewer is firmly the camp that much prefers the staggering pop/rock genius of \\"Revolver\\" to the ground breaking psychedelica of \\"Sgt Pepper\\". In the same way the sheer unrelenting perfection of \\"Pet Sounds\\" far outstrips the modular brilliant eerie innovation of \\"Smile\\". It does not detract however from one of the great pieces of modern music and a compositional genius who nearly pulled off the ultimate musical masterstroke. The word essential doesn't come close.ever from one of the great pieces of modern music and a compositional genius who nearly pulled off the ultimate musical masterstroke.

B005DKLPF6|4.0|On Mastodon's newest LP, they ditch the concept record for a more straight-forward approach. Only it's really, really, straightforward. I was quite worried at the thought of a less sprawling Mastodon, however they pull off this almost Avante-Pop-Metal sound quite well. After the dense behemoth that was Crack The Skye, it's surprisingly refreshing to see the band playing concise, 3 minute pop metal tunes, and most importantly, one gets the sense that the band is having more fun playing these tracks than on any record they have released in the past. Not to worry though, as succinct as this record is, it's still proggy as all hell. However a majority of these tracks, as zany and deliciously fun as they are, can easily wear out their welcome after repeated listens. It's a refreshing and interesting turn for the band, but I can't see myself investing nearly half as much time into this as their previous, more complex works.    [...]
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Many Yes fans have been critical of this release.  As a Yes fan myself, I like to put things into perspective.  At the core of long-time vocalist Jon Anderson's absence is the simple fact that he wants to tour on a much lighter schedule than the rest of the band because of his health.  His vocals are missed, but Benoit David fills in quite well.  It's a similar situation for Rick Wakeman, who wants a light touring schedule for different reasons.  Former Yes Keyboardist Geoff Downes is on keyboards for Yes now.  So while Rick and Jon are doing their own thing (sometimes together as in [[ASIN:B0047EAAMI Living Tree]],) Yes worked once again with Producer Trevor Horn to make Fly From Here.  Because this Yes lineup is similar to the lineup in 1980, it has distinct overtones from Yes' [[ASIN:B00009Z576 Drama]] album. In fact, a lot of the music is remakes of music from Geoff and Trevor's Buggles (i.e. [[ASIN:B0033QEUGI Adventures in Modern Recording]].) This is definitely not Yes at their best, but it's quite good.  Frankly the best moments in this album were the enhancements written by guitarist Steve Howe.  I'm happy to include this in my Yes collection and hopeful the guys still have another album or two in them.

0785814531|5.0|One of the most interesting things about owning this book is the introduction. You get a whole different perspective on Poe and his writings. I have read most of them before but I found this particularly intriguing.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Lush, evocative prose perfectly augments a suspenseful plot filled with interesting characters.  As noted elsewhere the two main characters remain the most undeveloped, but that remains a minor flaw in a book that so effectively creates a world of its own.  A second reading, immediately after the first, only served to heighten my enthusiasm.  Beautiful debut, as effective in its own way as \\"Jonathan Strange\\" and \\"The Name of the Wind.\\"

B005BGBPBG|1.0|Why I watched this movie, I have yet to conclude. If being lame were ever to be a fad this would be the trendsetter. Horrible, annoying characters, and a corny score.

So, I will divert attention to the packaging...<br /><br />I was surprised to see this single disc, no frills release using the same cover as the true 1970s celebration set--the one that includes 3 discs (one is a CD) and 16 page booklet from LIFE magazine, called \\"Eye on the '70s\\".  If you want the proper collectible, look at A [[ASIN:B0041IB7JK BRIDGE TOO FAR (COLLECTOR'S EDITION)]].
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Edit Nov 23rd: I can no longer see this app in the Amazon App Store application on either of my devices since it was renamed to UNO (Kindle Fire Edition). I bought it on my HTC Vision while it was still called UNO. Does this mean I can't receive updates anymore? I'm stuck with a version that doesn't fill the screen on my tablet?  Original review: The Google market version stretches to fill my tablet screen, this one does not. Can't change some settings without a scroll pad because I can't touch arrows on scroll views. No HD images. Works ok on my HTC Vision which is the only reason I rate it above zero.  I refunded android market version and wish I could refund this too. Not worth $3 or even $0.99.

Since \\"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\\" is continuing what was to be continued from the last book.<br /><br />The Capitol is now very angry and disjointed from the acting scene with the berries. In this sequel of the Hunger Games she is forced to love Peeta because of what she had started in the last novel. If she is to not obey, she would be put in danger and so would Gale. While I'm reading this book, I am always eager to find out what happens next ,it's almost very sudden and abrupt that something horrific, exciting, or even torturous happens during this sequel.<br /><br />I really like the Hunger Games Catching Fire due to its very emotional appeals , and the way it is written really eases it on the reader and puts he/she in a curious position to read on and not put the book down.

B005QI4TP8|3.0|I am a big fan of Lungs and I love swimming,hardest of hearts or bird song. The first time I heard Florence+the Machine was a few years ago and I was thrilled. The music was so magically and mystic to me and still it was modern. Then I bought Ceremonials I listened to the first 6 songs and still waited for the big wow effect. Then finally song 7) No Light, No Light and 8) Seven Devils...they had that dark touch wich i loved in lungs an miss in ceremonials.  Maybe that's what I don't like...it is just to cheerful maybe because it is for a wider audiece now.  I certainly did not expect a secound Lungs and this is not a bad album but that mystical fabulous sound I loved ,like the sound of the harp,is missning.  ( I am sorry for my english...still learning ;)and i hope this review was helpful)
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|What awesome characters - great chemistry - great plot - great acting. I can't believe it didn't stay on longer. Argh.
B005XRUPSC|5.0|Florence and the Machine: Ceremonials [1 November 2011]<br />By Arnold Pan<br />PopMatters Music Editor<br /><br />If there's a blueprint for art-scarred eccentrics to follow that outlines how they can aspire to become top-of-the-charts divas who still maintain the quirks that made them distinctive, you could do worse than the one Florence Welch has drawn up. There's a reason why Florence and the Machine can seem as at ease rubbing shoulders with the haute couture jet set as the band is getting remixed by au courant underground acts like the Weeknd and the xx, and that's simply because Welch exudes such confidence in her singular aesthetic vision that she can be herself: Following the same muse on her sophomore effort Ceremonials that helped her hit the big time to begin with, Welch is the kind of artist who takes the lead and lets others come along for the ride, rather than simply playing to the whims and trends of the marketplace or banking on gimmickry. As she puts it on \\"No Light, No Light\\", \\"You can't choose what stays and what fades away\\"--a sentiment that actually applies better to the music biz than to romance--so why not stick to your guns and do things on your own terms, especially when you've got a track record of making it work?<br /><br />Elevating their idiosyncratic style to an even grander scale, Ceremonials makes Florence and the Machine's captivating debut Lungs seem quaint and charming in comparison. As polished and artistically challenging as that first effort was, this latest outing gets the most out of Welch's strengths as a songwriter by shooting for a higher degree of difficulty and achieving a greater level of proficiency. Go no further than matching up the two standout singles from the respective albums: While her signature hit \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" may remain the more indelible number as Florence's breakthrough song, \\"Shake It Out\\" is not only more expansive in its scope, but somehow the catchier anthem as well. Some of that has to do with tone, since the whimsy and insistent optimism of \\"Dog Days\\" have given way to the Technicolor melodramatics of \\"Shake It Out\\". But the bigger difference can be attributed to the more ambitious compositional elements incorporated into the latter song: It's not just that the brisk, gently strummed harp from \\"Dog Days\\" has been replaced by an elegiac minor-key organ arrangement on \\"Shake It Out\\", but that Welch and company keep upping the ante each time they cycle through the chorus (\\"I like to keep my issues strong / It's always darkest before the dawn\\"), finally reaching a critical mass of booming percussion and ascendant keyboards that adorns Welch's soaring singing. So if \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" is all about getting past the drama, \\"Shake It Out\\" seeks it out headlong, especially when Welch is uttering lines like, \\"And I am done with my graceless heart / So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart.\\"<br /><br />\\"Shake It Out\\" isn't the exception to the rule on Ceremonials, but what sets the tone and a no-holds-barred approach to the album as a whole. Indeed, there's nothing about Ceremonials to suggest that Florence is shrinking from the spotlight that's shining on her, as she takes full advantage of her opportunities not by becoming a caricature of herself or getting by on cheap stunts, but by aiming for something that's got more staying power and an eye for the bigger picture. Building up tension until it reaches a fevered pitch, \\"What the Water Gave Me\\" has a mythical quality that recalls P.J. Harvey when she's getting all archetypal, only that Florence and the Machine keeps the sound dancefloor-ready with a glossier, slinkier feel to it. The same goes for the gothic dimensions of the dirge-like \\"Seven Devils\\", as psychothriller instrumental parts like chilling piano lines and eerie strings accompany Welch's resonant vocals. And while it may not be as dramatic, \\"No Light, No Light\\" offers one of the better examples on Ceremonials of Welch's dynamic pop chops, which transform what might otherwise be an artsy-fartsy new-agey sing-along into something with more heft and depth, thanks to its propulsive rhythms and urgent melodies.<br /><br />Yet what's even more powerful than Welch's sheer art-pop hubris on Ceremonials is her uncanny execution. It's something you can't help by notice as Florence and the Machine run through a gamut of genres on the album without ever sacrificing their inimitable style, hitting the mark on everything from natural forays into soulful R&B and electro-pop to a surprise plunge into glammy Britpop. On the vampy \\"Lover to Lover\\", Welch lets her rich, versatile pipes loose to show that she can do more than just keep pace with her big-voiced contemporaries, but adds enough of her own ethereal sound to the bluesy pianos and synths to make things come off all her own. \\"Heartlines\\" creates moods that are just as stirring and bracing, though it does so by playing up more electronic components and atmospheric synths than elsewhere on Ceremonials. Most remarkable--and least expected--of all, though, is the Britpoppy \\"Breaking Down\\", which almost sounds like something you'd expect from the mid-`90s heyday of Pulp and Suede than anything else. Maybe it's not as harrowing and imposing as some of the other tracks, but \\"Breaking Down\\" more than makes up for it with its strut and swagger, as Welch shows off her range as a performer by playing up the attitude, shifting from creepy grumbling that might make Jarvis Cocker proud to brashly delivered lines &agrave; la Brett Anderson.<br /><br />Sure, there are those moments on Ceremonials when Welch's exuberance gets the better of her, especially the over-the-top \\"Say my name\\" refrain on \\"Spectrum\\", or her flights-of-fancy are a little too in her head, like on the opener \\"Only If for Tonight\\". But ultimately, what makes Welch the artist that she is is that she's her own hardest-to-please critic, as the yearning, searching tone of \\"All This and Heaven\\" suggests when she explains that what she wants to express exceeds the grasp of her own skills and words: \\"And the words are all escaping / And coming back all damaged / And I would put them back in poetry / If I only knew how and I can't seem to understand it.\\" In the end, though, these lines from \\"All This and Heaven\\" smack of either false modesty or an overachieving perfectionist streak. And even if you were so inclined to take Welch at her word, it only means that the future somehow has even more in store for Florence and the Machine, since the sentiments on Ceremonials sound enough like poetry to prove that she understands how and what she's doing pretty well as it is.n artsy-fartsy new-agey sing-along into something with more heft and depth, thanks to its propulsive rhythms and urgent melodies.

They are cheating the fans with dry episodes having ONE and only one thing in each episode that makes it worth watching. What a rip-off. I love zombies and this is NOT ABOUT A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE any more, it's a soap opera where they throw in a few zombies to keep the title. I am not sure I will continue to watch. Yes, I can write better episodes which leads me to believe the professional writers are not so talented. I won't be wasting my $2 an episode.

Have now gotten several friends \\"hooked\\" on Castle, and my copies of Season 1 & 2 are being circulated!   Season 3 is the best season by far, in many ways. Great stories and continued character development. Episodes alternate between fun and suspenseful. It's been fun to watch the ongoing relationship between Beckett and Castle. I also appreciate how every character on the series is interesting and fun to watch as well. The extras in the set are great, too. This series is both delightful and addictive, and this DVD set is a must-have for Castle fans, both old and new.

Karwin goes over the most common pitfalls of SQL database design and programming.  As one that frequently has to work with someone else's database design I see these pitfalls over and over again.  Some are obvious to any DB programmer worth his salt, some others, not so obvious and still others the subject of religious wars.  I didn't agree with all of Karwin's suggestions or even what he identified as antipatterns, but that's fine.  I've been using SQL since the 80's and I still learned something from this book.  In our office, most of the programmers have to know enough SQL to make simple queries or at least to be able to decipher what some code is doing.  This book will help eliminate the part that normally follows \\"to know enough\\", that is the \\"to be dangerous\\" part.

B0051T47NQ|4.0|In the tradition of the reality-horror spawned by The Blair Witch Project, Troll Hunter is what it says on the tin: hunting trolls.  A group of three Norwegian university students, Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud), Johanna (Johanna Mørck), and cameraman Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen), create a documentary about Hans (Otto Jespersen), whom they believe is poaching bears, only to discover he is hunting much larger game.<br /><br />What they unearth is a grand conspiracy to keep trolls from the general public. Early on, the intrepid troll hunter decides to share everything, and in doing so reveals a few important rules: 1) trolls are like gorillas, humanoid animals, 2) they can smell the blood of a Christian man, 3) they will eat anything. These lessons are demonstrated in graphic fashion as Hans takes on each of the different types of trolls in their natural habitat, ranging from under bridges to cavern lairs.<br /><br />Troll Hunter has an explanation for everything, ranging from their vulnerability to sunlight to how they're kept under wraps.  There's even a Norwegian government agency conspiracy, the Troll Security Service (TSS), dedicated to covering it all up.  The trolls are bad enough; government goons are an even greater threat.<br /><br />The trolls are beautifully rendered in CGI that would probably not stand up to scrutiny under a wide angle lens.  But the small camera the university students use conceals many flaws, which makes the trolls all the more terrifying.  Although Troll Hunter strives heroically to have the trolls make sense, it sticks to its guns on making trolls giant, hirsute, lumpy creatures with big noses and tails. They are paintings come to life.<br /><br />Hans, a war veteran, has a fatalistic air about him as he pursues these trolls, and we get the sense that he is looking for a way out of a profession for which there is no retirement.  As the trolls become more aggressive he seeks larger and larger prey, until eventually he finds his Moby Dick in a Jotnar, which towers over two hundred feet tall.<br /><br />Troll Hunter's biggest flaw is its character development.  When the university students witness a death at the hand of a troll, they are sporadically concerned - no explanation is given for why they don't just call the authorities, give up, or mourn their friend properly.  Half the time they seem to think the entire thing is a big joke, even after one of them is mauled by a troll. They seem to have no plan for the revolutionary footage they record and, despite repeated threats by TSS agents, stubbornly stick to a near suicidal course of action. These are idiots asking to be eaten.<br /><br />That said, they didn't name this film Stupid Student Hunter.  It's all about the trolls and Troll Hunter delivers in spades.  Here's hoping the American remake will make the characters more sympathetic.red feet tall.   Troll Hunter's biggest flaw is its character development.

B004S699K4|5.0|echo bridge did a good job on the hallmark releases they put out. Then they starting doing other companies and they have done a poor job on every major release. This release is awful. The picture is awful and therefore a great movie gets a shoddy release. As for the film , I always really enjoyed this one. It's a fine horror movie for certain. The return of jamie lee curtis was highly anticipated and we even got her great mom in this one. Janet Leigh who has since died sadly does a fine job. Janet was incredibly pretty when she was younger and her career has many highpoints like \\"psycho\\" in it. So check her early stuff out.  Anyways the story is about ole michael finally catching up with his family.  This blu ray also has all the specks that the halloween triple pack\\" has the blu ray from canada looks alot better than this but still has all the specks and dirt on the print but the color is alot better.  That release also gives 'the curse of michael myers' and 'halloween resurrection\\"  both of which look awesome! So grab that release instead of the horrible echo bridge releases on blu ray.
B0061IMJBI|5.0|This was a great episode. Several folks have described it as \\"slow,\\" but I disagree. Rather than focusing on gore and fighting, this week, the writers worked on character development. We were able to learn a lot about the fears and vulnerability of several of the characters. We were able to see how they experience -- or try to suppress -- the stress of their situation. This is important stuff. There's plenty of time for shooting zombies in the head. I find the conversational side far more interesting.
B005J4TLQG|2.0|So my wife and I were wandering around the movie store looking for something fun for Halloween.  The guy at the counter suggested this movie and he usually has pretty good recommendations, so we gave it a shot.  Described as an old school B-movie about kids defending their block from an alien invasion, this sounded like it could be good.  Add in Nick Frost and the producers of Shaun of the Dead and it sounded like an obvious winner.  My wife and I appreciate a return to kid hero movies like Goonies and the recent Super 8, and thought this might be a lower budget, funnier, British take on the genre.  For the most part, all of this was true.  The plot was great b-movie fare, the special effects were low budget but more than adequate, and the concept pretty good.  So what's not to like?    Absolutely despicable characters that we never warmed to at all.  Nick Frost was fine, but was hardly in the movie.  The stoner kid and nurse were also pretty decent, but the rest of the children, about whom the movie was really about, were all a bunch of hateful little bastards.  From the opening scene where they rob a woman at knifepoint, to their constant disregard for any law enforcement, these children all needed a good spanking and a few years in a reform school.  I understand that England has an over the top police state and that youth are sometimes abused by the \\"nanny-state\\" and anti-social laws that unfairly target the youth.  However, watching a movie like this makes me almost sympathize with the police.  I was actually hoping most of the kids would get eaten by the end of the movie.  I kept hoping that the movie would eventually show some of the redeeming qualities of the kids, but it just didn't happen.  So Moses gave the lady her ring back.  Nice.  What about her purse and phone?  What about the emotional distress of being robbed by a gang of punks at knife point?  How about the two police officers and multiple friends that were killed because Moses decided to brutallykill some \\"dog\\" because it bit him?  Doesn't England have Animal Control?  Added to all this was the constant anti-establishment, gimmie-gimmie mentality pervasive amongst these kids.  At one point, one of the kids asks the nurse why her husband is in Africa.  After she explains that he is working for the red cross helping children there, the kid replies, \\"Oh, so he couldn't help the kids here in London?\\"  Huh.  How selfish of him.  Of course he should be helping the underprivileged punk rioters of London in one of the wealthiest nations in the world and ignore the millions of children in Africa living in tents without access to drinking water, food, and dying of aids.  How uncaring of him.  The only character that seemed half-way decent amongst the band of hoodlum thugs was the black kid with glasses, and he gets eaten early on.    Alas, this movie annoyed more than it entertained.  And don't get me wrong here; I can appreciate vulgar disenfranchised youth.  Super 8 had a lot of that too, and I thought that was a very enjoyable movie.  Super Bad and Bad Santa are some of my favorite movies too, so I'm not a prude.  These kids, however?  Repulsive little whiny punks.  Lock em' all up, throw away the key, and save your money for another film with likable characters.
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|Unlike some others my exposure to Kid Rock is limited to \\"Bawitdaba\\", \\"All Summer Long\\" and \\"Picture\\" (all of which I like).  So I bought this album hoping for more of that and I got it in spades.  Even a cursory listen will tell you that the songs are very nostaligic and reminicent of the \\"good ol' days\\".  Some of the reviews here were disappointed that Kid Rock didn't do anything overtly noteworthy to make the album stand out from the pack but if you are looking for something new that has the feel of Skynrd or CCR then this is definitely the disc for you.  That alone is noteworthy considering there is a complete lack of anything resembling what we used to call \\"southern rock\\" in today's music scene.    While \\"Collide\\" probably does not stand up to \\"Picture\\" it is still a song worth listening to.  \\"God Bless Saturday\\" and \\"Rock Bottom Blues\\" have a great sound are songs that would be fantastic if you were listening to them live at your favorite watering hole.  I thought \\"Care\\" was a bit of an odd song but still catchy enough that I found myself humming the chorus after the first listen.  The collaborations with other artists were clever and entertaining if not heavenly inspired.    All in all, this is a great album to play while motoring down the road or washing your classic car in the driveway.  Think back to some of the old greats and you'll find this album to be a great homage to the music that made American Classic Rock great.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|WOW....I saw these guys live a couple days ago and bought Worship Music at the show....and it is AMAZING. This is one heavy slab of thrash!  I have always been an Anthrax w/John Bush fan over Belladonna. I've seen them countless times in concert over the years and even though I liked the mainstays with Joey....\\"Caught in a Mosh\\". \\"I am the Law\\", \\"antisocial\\" etc. I never cared to own any of the albums as every Anthrax album for me personally was 1-2 great songs and a bunch of throw aways that never were must have jams.  When John Bush became vocalist, I thought the band sounded more consistant and complete than any time I had ever heard them. Don't get me wrong the Bush era saw a few subpar releses Stomp and 8.....but \\"Sound of White Noise\\" and \\"We've Come for You All\\" for me were the absolute BEST Anthrax ever.  When I heard Joey had come back, my first thought was \\"too bad, I guess it will be back to that old lackluster sound\\". I NEVER in my wildest dreams would have thought Joey's vocals would have been so aggressive as to make me buy the album....but they are!  I place this album right next to those other two I mentioned with pride. You can tell that the song writing was done with either Bush or the other guy in mind, but they have reworked it in a way that really works with Joey Belladonna. His vocals while still being his own, seem a lot less \\"whiny\\" much more aggressive but can still hit the highs smoothly. Just very impressed with him. I really hope they keep this form of writing if they keep him around.  IF YOU ARE A JOHN BUSH FAN THAT HAS NOT BOUGHT THE ALBUM DUE TO THAT FACT....PLEASE FIGHT YOUR INSTINCTS AND GET IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!

0142429112|4.0|Book was very good, though the ending a bit unfinished.  Characters felt very real, nice romance, loved all the details with the mysterious book.  But I was most impressed with this reader--I drive a lot & listen to a lot of audio books, this reader far surpassed any other I've heard!  She could change on a dime from a Scottish accent to an Indian one, male voice to female--all the characters had their own voices, so easy to keep them straight.  Very impressed!
B005ZO6DIO|5.0|I'd be so happy if SOA would kill off Tara. She's a terrible actress, for one thing. She only has 2, maybe 3, expressions, max. Her character is slow, predictable, and boring, and her body is out of shape and overweight. A hotter Tara -- not slutty, but hot -- would make for a more interesting SOA in my opinion.

B0000TB05A|5.0|First of all let me say I have been a U2 fan since 1983 and back then when I was 15 I wanted to see U2 play in Ireland.  That dream came true when I got to see them at this concert.  I was just outside the heart stage and let me tell you, nothing beats 80,000 screaming fans!  The emotion was evident when Bono talked about his father and the Edge's father  Bono's father died the week before) it was a very emotional show on many levels.  I had been to a few other U2 concerts and nothing beat the atmosphere in this particular one.  I watch it now and again and relive that day from getting up at 5am to get the bus to Slane from Limerick to being there for an all day show that started at noon time and finished at midnight to stumbling into bed at 6 am the next day.  A dream fulfilled and will never be forgotten!  The Boston show was good but this one is way better!
0679735909|3.0|Unless you're really brilliant and know all kinds of history and love difficult reads about writers who are brilliant and love history, this book is not for you.

0385534639|2.0|I was excited to read this book because I, too, saw a review that touted it as \\"The Next Harry Potter.\\" I disagree quite a bit with that statement. The only thing that this book has in common with the \\"Potter\\" series is that some of the characters can perform magic. And I will admit, Morgenstern describes the magical illusions and the overall atmosphere of the circus in interesting and vivid detail and definitely created a world where magic isn't just cheap trickery and deception.<br /><br />What I disliked most was the characterization of Marco. Morgenstern attempted to make him a swoon-worthy, irrisistible leading man, but I simply found him to be whiny, weak, and manipulative. I was never convinced that the love between him and Celia was as genuine and earth-moving as the author was trying to force it to be.<br /><br />***POSSIBLE SPOILERS!***<br />I felt so bad for Isobel when I discovered that Marco was using her to get information about the circus and Celia (whom he really cared for, but did not have the nerve to admit it), that any admiration I had for Marco faded completely. I almost stopped reading the book at that point. I had no desire for Marco to be united with his \\"star-crossed\\" lover Celia, when Isobel was clearly devoted to him and he cruelly strung her along throughout the whole book.<br /><br />I also didn't feel that \\"the man in the grey suit\\", a.k.a Alexander, was fleshed out enough. Throughout his first several appearances in the book, he was a cryptic man of few words. It was downright creepy when it was revealed he had no shadow,  but towards the end we see him laughing over wine with Widget and wanting to hear his stories. It just seemed like an odd way to conclude all the suspense built up in previous chapters.<br /><br />I also think this book requires a lot of your time constantly reading because the narrative jumps around so much between different points of view and different time frames. If you put it down and come back to it two weeks later, you would probably have to backtrack to remember what's going on and what year it is.<br /><br />To sum it up: The author really has a gift for creating atmoshpere and evoking all the senses, but I think the protagonists lack depth.to remember what's going on and what year it is.

B001PPLIEG|1.0|Not the movie. But the fact that a movie can be so great and entertaining and it's sequel is lamentable. Don't waste your time on this. Watch Casino Royale again. The plot of QOS makes absolutely no sense, the fighting scenes are brutal, the entire film is boring and dull, I can't understand what the villain is saying, and the Bond girls aren't particularly pretty. The lead has some weird scar or burn on her back (as the character) and it's ugly. Sexy Daniel Craig scowls throughout. He does his best; it's the script that's terrible.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Wow! What a moving piece of art. I watched it - reviewing it on Facebook as I watched. It brought many tears to my eyes, watching how bad the humans and animals are treated in the production of the Big Mac, Whopper, and Original/Xtra Crispy Chicken.<br /><br />Basically, animals are treated like liveless widgets - stuffed with chemicals - scared to death - slaughtered inhumanely and then we are served this on a place after we hear the words, \\"Can I take your order?\\"<br /><br />Really opened my eyes quite a bit and felt quite sorry for the lone farmer who just wanted to sell non-GMO soybeans and had his whole life turned upside down by evil Monsanto. I wonder how anyone has any morals or a shred of dignity working for that company. Shame on you Monsanto!<br /><br />I'm sure as people demand healthier food, Monsanto will jump on the bandwagon, hire this guy they financially brutalized and have him show them how to make seeds that are not Genetically modified.<br /><br />If consumers can get milk producers to stop putting synthetic hormones in milk (Walmart will not allow it any more), I'm sure we can turn around the cow, pig, and chicken mega-factories.

B005AUWY90|4.0|My kid loves this sequel, and that's enough for me. I was never a NASCAR fan or even a fan of cars (I actually dislike motor vehicles!!!), but I grew to love the original Cars as a kids' movie, and after seeing Cars 2 three times in the theater, I can say I liked this sequel much more than the original. Honestly. Pixar promised something bigger and more intense, and they kept that promise.  Now, I could pick apart the movie with a critic's eye, but what would be the point? Watching a kids' movie as a family is an experience, and if my kid loves this movie and can see the good in the characters and in the story at such a young age, then there is no point in my faulting Pixar or my listening to the dozens of critics who hated this sequel and who weren't really judging this movie from a car-loving kid's point of view anyway.

Going to listen to it a few more times before i give up.  Buy this album if you wish to hear some awesome guitar, but dont buy it if your looking for older catchy tunes.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Metallica fans, before you get too excited at the prospect of a follow-up to 2008's \\"Death Magnetic,\\" please know that this is in no way a Metallica album.  Lou Reed fans, before you begin to think your favorite member of The Velvet Underground has finally gotten off of his concept album kick following his four track ambient meditational album, \\"Hudson River Wind Meditations,\\" please know that he has not.<br /><br />When Lou Reed and Metallica first announced they would be collaborating for a full album, imaginations of fans ran wild.  Metallica is easily one of the most successful and influential metal acts of all time and Lou Reed's work with The Velvet Underground created his legacy as both a songwriter and musical innovator.  Their combined efforts had to result in something extraordinary, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />Even in his prime, Lou Reed was never much of a vocalist.  As a songwriter, he ranks among the best, but his voice is not the reason his albums sell.  At 69 years of age, his voice has only gotten worse and it shows on \\"Lulu.\\"  For 87 minutes, what Lou Reed does on \\"Lulu\\" could rarely be classified as singing.  In fact, most of the time \\"Lulu\\" sounds like a cross between a drunken rant and the mumbles of a crazy person talking to himself.  To be honest, I'm not convinced it isn't literally a combination of those two things.<br /><br />The concept of \\"Lulu\\" is basically Lou Reed taking on the persona of a young woman who has had terrible experiences with men and decides to give a drawn out monologue.  The creepiness of a 69 year old man playing the part of a young woman aside, Metallica's backdrop feels terribly out of place.  Their trademark guitars still create a staggering wall of sound, but the energy of each chord quickly dies as they're sustained through Reed's banter.<br /><br />It's obvious neither Lou Reed nor Metallica truly care what people think of this record.  \\"Lulu\\" is a musical experiment by a group of artists that can afford to do it, nothing more.  The unfortunate side-effect is that it punishes the most loyal of fans who blindly purchase the album expecting greatness.<br /><br />For those of you who pre-ordered \\"Lulu\\" as soon as you heard about it, I'm sorry to say it isn't even worth listening to once.  Take the album, stick it in your blender and press the liquefy button; you'll be doing your ears a favor.  At least the dreadful noise created by that should only last twenty seconds or so.ct is that it punishes the most loyal of fans who blindly purchase the album expecting greatness.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|This movie is a bit strange and disjointed and very, very random.  Normally, that is not a very good thing when it comes to a movie.  But in this case, that is what makes this movie so great.  It attempts to show you life from the viewpoint of a junkie, with the strange jumps and cuts and all that.  It looks like a bit of a mishmash, and it can sometimes be hard to folllow, jist like the real life of someone who is spun out on drugs.  It is really a brilliant piece of cinema.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I love this sound...Eno has helped with various groups thru the years , the bouncing rythmns of coldplay make for a sunny feel to this sonic soundscape. I love being outside listing to this. I am going to compare this to others to use as a backround for Eno produced albums. Talking Heads albums  Fear Of Music and Remain in Light started to bring Eno into the public eye. Then U2....The songs Beautiful Day and Zooropa are 2 of my favs. Eno jumping to Coldplay takes me places the comparisons didnt.  my first impression was like hearing the opening to The Streets Have No Names hits the stratosphere, I love it.  Others reviewers have mentiond the stealing of riffs from Big Country....well I am a Huge Big Country fan... my impression was thinking this is the closest thing to one of my biggest wishes that never happened, an album by Big Country produced by Eno. Big Countrys first 3 albums plus include the Wonderland EP are absolute must. The seering guitar sound is tops and the individual musicianship is great in Big Country...to borrow from them is an honor. Seems to me Colplays has more keyboard sound something these other bands keep low profiled or didnt need or want. All in all I like hearing this perhaps over produced outing. I do agree this mix is not what it should be.  Studying Enos career is helpful in understsnding the lastest from Coldplay. for something adventurous checkout some other Eno productions like Paul Simons \\"Surprise cd\\" or Andrea Coors \\" State Of Independence - cover \\"  which Eno reguards Donna Summers verion very highly - of a Jon and Vangelis song.. I agree. Eno played this song repeatedly when in the studio with Coldplay...RIGHT ON

The Betty that is professional and as Willamina says 'You know Betty, you dont always get it wrong' when she refers to the growth of Bettys fashion sense and that though her initial thought of MODE magazine was not of high importance, Mode slowly becomes one with Betty. The one-liners are still classics, the transformations are comming to a close sadly and Mode is at the end of its Era. Sad but definetly satisfying.

0385534639|4.0|The best part of this story is the whimsy. The magic, the beautiful characters Morgenstern creates that fill her tents and the circus itself. The story was enjoyable, hard to put down, but it wasn't perfect. The love story was at times unbelievable, there was sex when it didn't add to the story, and the ending left me wanting.

B004LROUNG|5.0|Immediately after finishing the last chapter of \\"The Litigators,\\"  I read some of the reviews. It always amazes me how different people come away with radically differing views on a subject. I guess there is some truth in all of them.<br /><br />First the criticisms: At times I got the feeling John Grisham wrote a great short story and then screwed it up by filling in some of the chapters with trivial hyperbole merely to increase the page count. As a writer myself, I too plead guilty as charged. I suspect his first draft was a masterpiece. I can't say it's a book you can't put down. Too many times, I had to force myself to not skip unnecessary paragraphs. I would characterize the book as a roller-coaster ride, with the highs way above the mark and the lows mired in mud so dense you have to claw your way through to get to the other side. There were unnecessary characters introduced that could have well been left out. They served no purpose other than to slow down the pace.<br /><br />Now for the good stuff: On several occasions I found myself laughing out loud. Especially in the scene where the Senior Partner makes his opening remarks to the jury. That was completely unexpected and it set the stage for promises of more tomfoolery ahead. Grisham was writing from his soul at that point and reminiscent of the scene when the lawyer crashed through the courtroom ceiling in the movie \\"Trial and Error.\\" From that point on, anything that could go wrong, did go wrong, and Grisham portrayed it brilliantly. He may not know it, but he has a real flair for comedy. I wish he would use it more often. There were several more missed opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, the overall story was superb and no doubt it will be made into a Hollywood movie, but my guess is the screenplay will be written into a comedic performance instead of a drama.<br /><br />I've tried to purchase more of Grisham's books on Kindle and I am thankful he saw fit to release this one as a Kindle product. I believe the majority of readers will continue to rate this book with five stars. I'm looking forward to more roller-coaster rides from Mr. Grisham.s will continue to rate this book with five stars.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|Thankfully, Amy Lee and Evanescence have finally returned with a fantastic new release after several years of no releases. However, this great new album, especially the Deluxe Edition with 4 bonus tracks, plus a DVD, more than makes up for their long absence. This fantastic album is simply outstanding from the very begining to the very end period. Amy Lee as certainly matured as an outstanding Rock singer, piano player, and harp player, and Evanescence has certainly matured as a hard-rocking band. Thank God for bands like Evanescence for keeping \\"Rock\\" alive, in these days of so much \\"Hip-Hop\\".  The video of \\"What You What\\" is fantastic. Also, if you're a dedicated fan like me, then I definitely recommend the Deluxe Edition of this great realease. Thanks!!!!

B005LRWRZ8|4.0|It's a good record. However, no track stands out as being better than or as memorable as the prior two records' tracks. Dave's songwriting abilities aren't showcased on this record... The catchy lyrics aren't present on this record as on Mustane's past efforts-  like RIP, or Countdown.  Dave seems to almost talk out the lyrics on \\"13\\" rather than sing over a melody.   And similar to the last three records, the guitar solos are boring and anticlimactic. In my opinion, the Megadeth name has been blemished from a constant revolving door of band members over the years, which ultimately has hurt the brand.  The best lineup included Marty, Dave, David, and Nick - this lineup also brought out the most creativity from Mustane.    Here are my words of wisdom to Dave Mustane - Take about 5-6 years off from recording any new records under the Megadeth brand, and re-discover your relationships with Marty Freidman and Nick Menza.  Dave must come to the realization that the band is not all about him, as his vocal style has never been as pleasing to ear as let's say Phil from Pantera, or James from Metallica.  Thus, Megadeth does not work unless the best, complete whole package is there -vocals, drums, bass, guitar...  Also, Dave continues to deny what his fans really want:  We want Rust in Peace, which means faster tempos, less crunch distortion and more grit w/ overtones, and finally politically driven anti- George Bush policy type lyrics. It's called Thrash, and Mustane can't just seem to re-discover this genre - what made Megadeth really unique.  It's hard to re-create perfection, but Megadeth has gone down too many different roads, changing their sound and style that they have really confused their audience over the years.    Let's talk about Vic Rattlehead.  Vic used to be the prominent figure on all of Megadeth's cover art, which helped created the coolest album covers in the metal era.  Over time, Vic was replaced by babies hanging from their ankles, a mouse in a trap, andnow Vic with his back turned to the audience on the cover of this latest release.  Like Megadeth's recent albums, their true musical style has disappeared like Vic's prominent identity on the album covers.    And Marty Friedman - He's just not replaceable.  Dave should at least petition him to do Megadeth studio albums, even if that means a replacement guitarist for all tours while Marty returns to Japan.  When I hear Marty play on past tunes including Angry Again, 99 Ways to Die, Holy Wars, there are masterful exotic guitar passages that just make Megadeth sound different, and a cut above the rest of competing bands.  Back in college, I interviewed Megadeth's Ex- Manager (from the Youthanasia record) and he too emphasized that unless a band is truly unique and a cut above the rest, they'll never make it or be sustainable.  And that guy had a lot of credibility considering the diversified huge acts he had managed in the past and present.  With that being said, like any business entity, Megadeth needs to re-locate its competitive advantage and regress to the formula that helped create their success from Rust all the way through Youthanasia.   With that being said, I do recommend this record.  It has some good riffs.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|I have never, ever, watched a TV series that gripped me as much as Breaking Bad does.  I was a huge fan of The Sopranos and Weeds and thought nothing could top those, but this show sure does.  Every character is precisely molded to perfection.  You love to love them and love to hate them depending on the character.  Even with all of the illegal activity and wrong-doing, you still love Walt and Jesse and always hope for the best.  Addicting doesn't even describe it.  I've ordered all three DVD Seasons available and it's too easy to rip through them in one sitting.  You really don't want to do that because it leaves you desperately wanting more and eventually, they run out and you're left hanging.  I'm in the midst of waiting for Season 4 to be released and this is torture.  As dramatic as the series is, you also have to love the humor that is thrown in here and there.  The dialogue between Walt and Jesse is priceless, as they are as opposite as two people come.  The thing that drew them together in the first place constantly threatens to tear them apart, but they seem to have a very deep loyalty toward each other that keeps them superglued together.  Most people that I know have never even heard of the show; I am doing everything I can to change that.  If someone had told me it was a show about a meth lab I probably wouldn't have bothered to start watching.  I had no idea what the show was about until I actually started watching and by then, it was too late.  It is a must see for those who love suspense and quirkiness.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Fantastic film with non-stop action from start to end. Not for fruitcakes but for serious horror fans. It will leave you asking \\"Is there an Afterlife?\\" and \\" SPOILER \\" . This is one of the most talked about and debated horror movies of all time because of the great story to a twisted ending.   Only the dvd is available in the US, so I recommend getting the blu ray version at the canadian amazon site which cost $10+$7ship = Well worth it  Enjoy!
0300169787|5.0|Quite simply the epitome of creative genius.    Like the old saying goes, \\"A picture is worth a thousand words\\" . . . in fact McQueen's pictures are easily worth twice that.  The fashion design world lost out on a chance at metamorphosis into a higher art form with this man's death. I only hope his art will continue to inspire painters, sculptors and artists from all walks of life for years to come.

B001NXDSLQ|4.0|I just recently purchased the 40th Anniversary (director's cut) of Woodstock, on DVD.  I saw some of it on a documentary TV show, and was compelled to buy it.  The DVD really gives the viewer an up close and personal vantage point of the different performers during the three-day festival(Richie Havnes, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, Joan Baez, Joplin, Hendrix etc.  There is also pre-concert footgae of the stage being constructed (really cool).  As well, there are several interviews with some of the woodstock attendees (all pretty young).  At one point some teenagers are filmed calling their parents to let them know they \\"are okay,\\" while another snapshot shows a father lying on a blanket sleeping with his infant child sleeping on top of his chest.    In a lot of ways the DVD captures and highlights some of the enduring innocence of the time, and yet the very growing angst for the hippie culture's yearning for the world to adopt their gospel (peace, love, music) some would say: sex, drugs and rock n roll!  During one scene, someone is interviewed outside a convenience store which shows the front page headline of the day, which sadly was about the Tate LaBianca murders at the hands of Charles Manson and others which had just taken place a week earlier.  I highly recommend this product if you are a fan of that era's music and history.  It really allows you to go back and to see in a microcosm, just what it was like to be there in some way.  It's an experience all its own: the language, the attitude, and last but not least, the music itself.  It's obvious that though history was being made in terms of man flying to the moon, as well as the war in Vietnam, that to many at Woodstock - another kind of history was being made.  Enjoy.

0307887898|4.0|Eric Ries makes a lot of good points in his book which would be super useful for start ups. I believe that startups should use his recommended methods of using quick feedback loops and innovation accounting in order to be successful. However, I felt that he repeats the same points over and over again in his chapters. He potentially could have made all his points in just around 50 pages and been just as effective. Also, I was disappointed that there were not more real world examples and stories in the book in more detail.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Brilliant. Masterful. Takes a while but gets better with every listen. Huge energy, dark moods, a journey through. The louder you play it the more it makes sense. It has groove and masterful intensity. But this is bare, dangerous music. And it rocks in the best way of rock 'n' roll. It challenges as great art should do. It's uncompromising but it is made with passion and intensity. It is not here to attack the listener but rather to push and shove forward, to stretch and strain, and break free in a muscular run. It has rhythm and melody and grace though these take digging out. It has dirt and vulgarity too. Poison in the blood. It is not easy, nor is it deliberately difficult. It was not made to insult or to abuse. It is what it is. Rough, cutting up the edges, out at the end of things. And, you know, it rocks. Turn it up!

B003F1HWUC|5.0|Tonight with all the bad news happening in the world I wanted something that I could store my brain in a glass jar for an hour or two and just mindlessly enjoy.  I thought of this movie, an all time favorite, and voila, Amazon had it to stream.  I haven't seen this movie in a good 15 years or more but I remember laughing so hard at times that I thought I was going to suffocate.  I'm ready to detach for a bit and just enjoy.  If you need to disconnect for a while then give this movie a go.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Great to have DVD's of a series that I enjoyed enormously 30+ years ago.   Interestingly, my kids (11&13) were not fond of the amount of \\"face time\\" of Jacob Bronowski in each episode.  Unlike the \\"Planet Earth\\" series, where David Attenborough's narration is always in the background, there are frequent shots of Bronowski in front of scenes of interest in \\"Ascent of Man\\".    I love listening to him, and don't mind his dated clothing and \\"philosopherish\\" air.  Not so with the kids.  Love it anyway!

B0057R5XRG|2.0|This review is a review of the Blu Ray quality alone; my commentary on the quality of this movie would be silly in light of the numerous glowing reviews of this film over the years.  Bottom line, I was disappointed and surprised.  I've seen several contemporaneous films (e.g., Pulp Fiction) and even much earlier films (e.g., Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street) that are incredible examples of what can be done with a carefully executed transfer, and have to believe that quality is largely dependent on how much the authors are willing to put into the effort.  Given the typical regard with which this film is held in the cinephile community, as well as the fact of Spielberg, I'm very surprised to report the Blu Ray quality is lagging.  The audio is very good, but it was good on the originals as well.  However, the picture quality is, at best, a 5% improvement on the original SD-DVDs.  I really am shocked to report this, but the first film, clearly the best and the one had the most technical staff, is often very grainy, especially in darkly lit shots.  I happen to absolutely adore this film and am willing to accept the mere 5% improvement, but I encourage you to carefully consider just how important this film is to you.  If you don't think its the best thing since sliced bread, you may consider satisfying your need with the basic DVDs.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|\\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is Coldplay's latest attempt to further expand its sound into a wider palette of colorful landscapes and experimental sounds. Like U2's work in the 90s, there are ups and downs, impressive creations and noble misses but it's never boring. Here Coldplay have again gone into the lab with Brian Eno, the sonic guru best known for his groundbreaking work with Roxy Music, David Bowie and of course, U2. The result is an even larger evolution than the band's last, world conquering album \\"Viva La Vida.\\" There are more lush, atmospheric layers of sound here, in fact the sound is such a center of attention that one wishes Martin's lyrics would have been better polished to accomodate the grand design.  While the sound has certainly expanded, Coldplay still succeeds in keeping the band's basic identity and imprint alive and present. The album starts a small flash of atmosphere and quickly goes into \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" which is a jumpy, snapping number decorated with Johnny Buckland's Edge-like guitar riffs and  basic, tapping drum rhythm with Martin crooning about feeling nervous and feeling chased. \\"Paradise\\" is a grand experience of sonic architecture of the kind Coldplay excels at. It features a soaring chorus impulsed by a gorgeous scenery of organs and violins reminiscent of the textures from Coldplay tunes like \\"Lost\\" and \\"Viva La Vida.\\" \\"Charlie Brown\\" is another strong track that pounds ahead with fun wordplay. \\"Us Against The World\\" is a decent, elegant moment that doesn't really offer anything new, more an intermission before \\"Every Teardrop Is Waterfall\\" dives back into the album's experimental spirit. Here Coldplay uses synth club beats in a unique song that transcends into a scorching drum part by Will Champion.   The curious thing is how well the album works when the band gets out of its comfort zone and goes to new realms. The acoustic numbers where Coldplay simply does what it always does pale in comparison to the moments where they damn the consequences and burst the test tubes. \\"Princess Of China\\" for example is about as far away from rock n' roll as the band has ever gone, it kicks off with an Orientalist hybrid of a techno intro which turns into a hypnotic club beat, Martin is joined by Rihanna who drops the whips and S&M for a dark tale of loss and heartbreak. \\"Up In Flames\\" is a ballad but one where Coldplay again change their usual game and produce a haunting piece, like a broken heart from the future. The design of this album is reportedly based on 70s graffiti and even the White Rose resistance movement during Nazi Germany. Much of the sound compliments these ideas with evocations of youth, rebellion in times of crisis and the spontaneous power of creativity.   \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" could have easily been a confusing mess similar to U2's \\"Pop,\\" and indeed the album does have some flaws, the prime one of which are Martin's lyrics which never seem to advance into anything other than the usual set of words he's always used. \\"Viva La Vida\\" was a masterpiece because it gave us great sounds with equally creative writing, nothing in \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" compares to the memorable lyrics of songs like \\"Cemeteries Of London\\" or \\"Violet Hill.\\" There should be a richness of words to compliment the richness of the soundscapes. But still this is an excellent album that shows a unique level of innovation. It ends with some soaring notes on \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart.\\" \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is an impressive effort but it's real power is in how it feels like just a peek at what the future might hold for the world's biggest band.
0470449748|4.0|I bought this book to go along with my GMAT study plan through Beat the GMAT and GMAT Club.  The questions are challenging however you should get a different book to help teach the concepts.  Some of the Math instructions simply have example problems.  I'd rather learn the \\"why\\" over memorizing the \\"how\\".  GMAC offers online courses (some free) which use this book as well.  So it is a must-have for studying.    I've only been studying for a little over a week, but so far I am pleased.  I will follow-up later if my opinion changes.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|The movie is definitely not for everyone--not for the easily bored.  How could anyone who has watched Clint Eastwood's films for the past decade expect an Eastwood film to fit a certain type?    This one is indeed slow-moving, except at the beginning--a meditation, not so much about the hereafter per se, but about the possibility of contact with the departed.  It explores territory movies do not often cover, but I would not expect a movie to provide me \\"answers\\" about the afterlife.  This one just explores.  The individual character plots are all interesting, and they all coincide at the end that seems hard to believe.  But then you have to remember the favorite author of Matt Damon's character--the reason he goes to London in the first place--and such plot twists then seem logical.  You can either go with the flow or not.  It's more enjoyable if you do, though.

1595141715|5.0|I was reading this book and was carrying it around while I was substitute teaching in a high school class today.  Several of the girls saw the book and recognized it and told me that they thought it was a great book. I agree.    At the beginning of the book, Clay, a high school student receives a package in the mail.  It contains audio tapes.  He finds a tape recorder and begins to listen.  The tapes are of a classmate who recently committed suicide.  She says that if he is listening to the tape, then he is one of the reasons why she is dead.  He spends the night following her map through the town listening to her tapes that explain why she committed suicide.  Through her eyes we see how each little incident added up to big problems in her mind.  It is intended to make people think about how they treat one another, which is something that high school students need to think about.    I like the dual narration style of the book and found it to be very suspenseful.  As I read it, I felt like I was Clay, looking around to see if other people realized what I was reading.  I had to stop reading and take breaks from the book a few times because it is just so sad.    I am glad that some of the high school girls told me how much they enjoyed the book.  I think that it is something they can relate to.  I hope it makes high school students think.
B004A8ZWWE|4.0|\\"Real Steel\\" (2011) is a considerably above average example of what I call the \\"CGI laser light show\\" movie genre, much better than most (insert \\"Sucker Punch\\" here). Think \\"The Champ\\" (1931) with elements from \\"Transformers\\" (2004), \\"Rocky\\" (the 1976 original), and \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" (1991).      At its core it is another redemption tale as aging boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) gets a chance to be a father to the now eleven year-old son he abandoned at birth (Max Kenton - nicely played by Dakota Goyo).  Charlie is informed that his ex-wife has died and he leaps at the chance to cut a deal with his wealthy sister-in-law to give her custody of the boy.  But through a series of somewhat contrived events the jaded Charlie ends up with Max for the first summer.   The secret to this type of fairy tale lies in how well they connect with viewers; if the movie can get viewers to strongly identify with the character (in this case Max) as he gets a huge rush from suddenly becoming part of the robot-fighting world, the viewer will get hooked. Then the challenge is to keep them hooked for as long as possible. \\"Real Steel\\" hooks you and provides this vicarious rush well past the midway point, in large part because of the twist of having Max bond with the robot as a surrogate father, much in the spirit of \\"Terminator 2\\" but also nicely integrated with the ongoing dynamic of the old robot being Charlie's twin or at least the piece than completes him . But eventually the wheels fall off, or in this case get knocked off by a \\"Rocky\\" scripted overreach.  The illusion bursts and most viewers crash back to reality because it takes too much mental energy to suspend disbelief when the team breaks into the glitzy celebrity world. From that point on it is just overwrought melodrama, with the inspirational \\"redemption on steroids\\" theme aggressively shoved down each viewer's throat.    Of course this surfeit of cliché might have been palatable but for Kevin Durand's overplayed heavy.  Like a series of cardiac arrests the heart of the movie first begins beating irregularly during his debt collection sequence, is then severely damaged by his lame homeboys routine, and finally succumbs from his sequence at the conclusion of the first round of the climatic fight.  These would make great deleted scenes for the DVD release but should have been mercifully trimmed from the already too-long film.   The one positive of the glitzy sequences was Olga Fonda's \\"Farra Lemkova\\" character, an amped up to super-hotness play on WWE's Stephanie McMahon.  She provided the film's most interesting images, a kind of an embodiment of slick temptation.  Can't say the same for Karl Yune's Asian robot designer who essentially was tasked with the Apollo Creed role.  Part of Rocky's success lay in Creed's newly acknowledged respect for Rocky at the conclusion of the film, this allowed the ending to transcend its cliché elements because it nicely blunted the obvious good vs evil dynamic.  Yune was not allowed to play his character this way and \\"Real Steel\\" loses considerable depth, dimension, and IQ points because of it.    Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

B0053YGYO4|5.0|Excelente trabajo. El aporte de Brian Eno en este disco ha sido determinante y han logrado un disco superlativo.  Pense que este iba a ser como los anteriores discos de Coldplay, es decir regulares, con buenos temas, pero nada espectaculares, pero me equivoque...a mi juicio este CD esta entre los 3 mejores de la banda.  Impecable de inicio a fin...recomendable la compra sin pensarlo mucho.

0316098515|5.0|This is a cookbook that will be sought after by cooks for generations. As a chef, I have been early awaiting it and it did not disappoint. This book is on par with other recent cookbooks like the Big Fat Duck Cookbook, Quay, and of course the now-becoming-a-classic French Laundry Cookbook. In fact, I would describe this book as very similar to the Quay book. The photography is stunning, the plating is fantastic, and the recipes are well structured.  Like another reviewer suggested, this book is not one for amateur cooks, but either as a \\"coffee table book\\" or for more professional cooks. Many recipes are complex, though there are a number that are pretty straightforward (at least from the professional cook's perspective). Many recipes are very inspiring and innovative. This book uses a lot of modern techniques, as well as relying on some of the classic methods.  As might be expected from Danny Meyer, this book offers some restaurant philosophy and some behind-the-scenes sections. These are helpful in both understanding how Eleven Madison Park works, and as a sort of business lesson (as another reviewer pointed out). These are perhaps more the former, simply solving some curiosity but for professionals will give some inspired tips or ideas to try in their own restaurant.  For anyone who loves fine cuisine, this book is a bargain. It is straightforward (it offers tips on how to complete some recipes without certain equipment or ingredients, e.g. liquid nitrogen) and it is beautiful. Strongly recommended.
B000000OQY|4.0|Released when the band was indeed the hottest band in the land, G N'R Lies is an 8-song EP that is half live and half acoustic. This was an interesting release at the time because while it was new product for the masses to buy, it was also before the unplugged craze took off and was all in vogue. The live side was originally released in 1986 as Live Like A Suicide and is very good as \\"Reckless Life\\" is a raging opener that is heavier than anything on Appetite for Destruction while \\"Nice Boys\\" is a catchy anthem originally done by Rose Tattoo that is performed with vigor. \\"Move to the City\\" is very good as is the cover of Aerosmith's \\"Mama Kin\\". The acoustic side is even better as \\"Patience\\" is a moving ballad that was a huge hit and Axl's vocal during the outro is really cool. \\"Used to Love Her\\" is both catchy and humorous while \\"You're Crazy\\" is the same tune from Appetite... only slower and more laid back. \\"One In A Million\\" was the tune that got them in all kinds of trouble back in the day and even if its bigoted lyric makes Archie Bunker look mild mannered, it is still a great tune. If you loved Appetite for Destruction, you will dig this as everything is good and \\"Patience\\" and \\"One In A Million\\" are among their best tracks.

B000JLSLZQ|5.0|The movie is an excellent adaptation of the smash-hit musical, The Phantom of the Opera.  It brings a slightly different color from the Original Cast of the musical, but just like most of the 1499 people before me have said, it stands as its own.  I certainly enjoyed Emmy Rossum's youthful and serene voice of Christine as it was, in fact, more fitting for the character.  Gerald Butler's Phantom is also very enjoyable as his voice brings in a new flavor to the modern audience.   Great acting, music, and thematic elements to make this an easily enjoyable piece at home theater.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I was hoping that this series would be as informative and well acted as \\"Band of Brothers\\".  I am finding however that the presentation is too melodramatic dwelling on the inner emotions of wussies rather than the demonstating what ordinary men placed in extraordinary situations need to do.  I have not finished watching the entire series, but have been dissappointed so far in the presentation of the key characters.  I have read two of the books that the series was based on and am having a hard time discerning what facts were extracted from the books other than the names of characters that, so far, remain mere shadows in the story.    I hope the series gets better as it goes along, but so far, this effort has only served to show how excellent the \\"Band of Brothers\\" production was.  Hard to hit two home runs in a row, I guess.  I still commend the producers for presenting historical material on this part of the War to keep the actuality of war in our consiousness.  I still give the series a high rating, but it could have been better.

B001H1SVO8|5.0|The other day, my viking friend badmouthed the critical gem that is Fight Club, but he hadn't a peg-leg to stand on. And that confrontation reminded me how great this film is, and I went online and bought it with my babysitting  money. My friend, he argued that the multiple references to IKEA and cults within the same film was condemning against the Swedish furniture exporter. But clearly my grey-bearded friend was wrong, and nothing could be further from the truth of the matter, in my humble opinion. Even going back to the Homeric epics, discontinuity has long been a serious theme in literature and film, and Fight Club is a Pièce de résistance of this line of thought.  Shirtlessness aside, Fight Club is the type of film that burrows deep into one's soul and wrenches out the Babylon-like demons of the modern capitalistic society. Brad Pitt is the type of character that makes me want to be a better person and purge my living room of matching furniture.   Unlike most films, Fight Club asks the important questions, such as: what does it mean to be a stranger to others? to yourself? what does it mean for something to be soap and not something more? what would have become of the bronze god-man Frank Black if \\"where is my mind?\\" was not played during the closing credits? This film changed my life.
B0001611DI|5.0|As a deep lover of the zombie genre, I knew that I had to go back and watch the original Dawn of the Dead. So I finally got my hands on a copy and loved it. Yes the effects are less than awe-inspiring but great effects don't necessarily make a great movie, and bad effects don't mean a bad movie. This is definately true here. this is arguably one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen, so for anyone who likes the genre, or just needs a good scare or two, watch it.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Perfectly made adaptation of one of the most popular classics ever. The director/screenwriter made the right choices in eliminating the big distractions--the kindly head mistress who can't really help and the coincidence of finding that Jane is related to her saviors, the Rivers, with whom she shares her inheritance.  The northern Yorkshire accents also add to the charm. I watched it three times and it was the second time that I realized how much I like it.  I was too busy trying to keep up with the dialog to hear the beautiful music and enjoy the characters.  By the third time I'm in heaven.  I've been doing some reading about Charlotte Bronte and one of the greatest love stories is her marriage to Arthur Nichols.  I'm looking forward to reading the book \\"Mr. Charlotte Bronte.\\"  Another plus in the movie is the intricate dialog straight from the book. Another film that is a favorite of mine is \\"North and South,\\" the PBS adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's book.
1423136802|5.0|Riodan mixes old school mythology into a real world setting with good plots and unexpected turns. Really good read that i enjoyed a  lot
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|This is horrible, maybe if they made an instrumental only version it would be OK but Lou Reed is hard to listen to. It sound like a compilation of interludes instead of an album.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|If you don't know all the career of Reed don't criticize him in a so rude way. He is a poet of Rock and Roll and he has a career of more than 40 years. He has adapted many poetry from many authors in his works from Schwartz to Edgar Allan Poe and now from Wedekind. I've been studying him for many years and including to these studies a final work of master degree. Sorry Metallica Fans, this is a Lou reed composed album and it's very different from Metallica itself. This Cd Lulu is a great Job. To make a real critic to it you have firstly to study music in a Philosophical view and also in a literary way. If you don't do that, please don't belittle this work. Above all you have to know a lot of concepts on music philosophy and sociology to make the right critique, if you don't do that, unfortunatelly you are speaking to the wind and can be destroing a work from many days(months, years) of a serious and dedicated job of a great composer. So please be careful on analizing a job that seems to you a trash but in fact it isn't. To finish I'd like to say that \\"art\\" in its real sense can be found everywhere, which is the case of this job. Adding some more comments I could say that for being causing a so strong reaction between fans of Metallica and Lou reed, this work justify that is an interesting work. Poor music albuns or any kind of art that are not perceived, sorry to say that, but in my opinion are just repetition of what it has been done for years and years without changes or just something that we just want to listen without reflecting. It is based on this that I believe this work will be discussed for a long time and probably we won't have a final and agreed conclusion. So take it easy with the words on commenting it!
0374275637|5.0|The Linda problem discussion in the first chapter really provokes a lot of thought and exposes a very common flaw in human reasoning as well as authority and expertise.  Experts, when not pattern-recognizing a problem in their field, may not apply their expertise or may let their personal immediate priorities or brush it off without thinking.  I cannot help but wonder how these statistical events explain how the circuits of the brain developed in primates in terms of finding \\"value\\" in the environment.  A choice of searching for the intersection of two choices may seem to be wrong mathematically but I wondered if the chance at a correct payoff does not drive our brains in these cases, so we choose plausibility instead of probability.  I really enjoy the clear, succinct but language and phrasing of this book that is notable right from the start.  Instead of trying to sort out the BS from the author it lets me read with less suspicion and giving me the power to concentrate more on the subject.  The author is sincerely trying to convey information precisely rather than dazzle people with his mental gymnastics in order to sell them something as is so common with this type of books and the intersection into the business field books that often do not have any real information to sell.  The author clearly understands he knows his subject and is trying to bring it to the public in as direct a way as possible, in my estimation.  I don't think I will be able to put this book down or just read it once, there is a lot to consider here, and even in consideration, how do we train ourselves to be more perceptive of our innate first but incorrect guesses?  5/5 stars, a must read.

6302517036|3.0|Fright Night, 1985 film<br /><br />This story is more of a parody than a horror movie (like the classic \\"Love at First Bite\\"). A family has new neighbors, two men in their thirties. Is there something funny about this couple? One of the men doesn't go out in the daytime. Neither seems to go to work (trust fund babies?). Then Charley sees a strange sight at night - one neighbor is a vampire! He tells his friends and the police, but who believes in vampire legends today? Charley seems to be a crank. The local TV station has old horror movies from long ago. This show is called \\"Fright Night\\". The host is Peter Vincent, a former actor. Charley contacts the host of this show because he knows how to fight vampires. [You won't find \\"Vampire Killers\\" listed in your local Yellow Pages.]<br /><br />And so the story runs on about ridding the neighborhood of these undesirable characters. The police can't help, there is no zoning law against vampires in that city. [What about your town?] There is a complication with Charley's girlfriend. Will Amy be attacked and bitten to turn her into a vampire? If so, can she be saved by killing that vampire before sundown? There is a lot of scary action. Can Peter Vincent succeed in killing that vampire, like he did on those old shows? Of course, the good guys win in the end. You will be amused and entertained by this low-budget comic horror movie if you are not too picky about its story. Was any animal hurt in this movie?
0316098515|5.0|I have just finished reading this cookbook. That's right, reading. In the tradition of the stronger narrative and transformative cookbooks like Judy Rodgers' Zuni Cafe Cookbook, Keller's The French Laundry Cookbook, and perhaps Blumenthal's The Fat Duck Cookbook, this book comes along with not just the gorgeous production value of an auspicious coffee table art book and the exactly duplicated recipes of one of the most interesting young chefs cooking today but with two important stories: one is the detailed story of the making of a brilliant chef, and the other is the surprisingly revealing story of growth of the culture of a well run restaurant and it's successful parent company.<br /><br />  I say transformative because just as those cookbooks change, perhaps forever, the way a chef or cook might look at food, this book will leave readers from all of the various tiers of expertise, from the dedicated home cook to the ambitious chef/restauranteur with invaluable ideas for their own cuisines and companies. For the professional not just in the industry, but professionals in any sort of business, there are valuable lessons to be gleaned from the book. As you proceed through the four seasons into which the recipes in the book are divided, you also proceed through a narrative arc that describes, in short essays written under the headings of the restaurant's core values (derived, incidentally, from a statistical analysis of the most common adjectives found in articles describing Miles Davis and his music that the company performed and then made into a poster that hangs in the kitchen, i.e. \\"collaborative\\" \\"vibrant\\", depicted in the book if you would like to discover them) the story of the restaurant told through time up to the present day detailing various key players in the growth of the restaurant, and the meals and ideas that inspired the way the staff work. For example, based on a suggestion from one waiter, the terms \\"front of the house\\" and \\"back of the house,\\" an ancient division/rivalry in the industry, were dismissed of along with the perceived division, replaced with \\"dining room\\" and \\"kitchen.\\" Also, the company allows its staff to take \\"ownership\\" of their respective areas. The evolutionary impact of these and myriad other ideas on the way the restaurant runs, as well as how they were arrived at, forms the core of this narrative arc. No other cookbook, I think, has proved this detailed about how a staff formed goals, strove for them, and achieved them, sometimes meeting failure along the way. The failures are detailed: the original Madison Park restaurant, the failure of the chef to win the James Beard award, even the restaurants failing finances as the recession kicked in. All are told in the shadow of three michelin stars, but even though you know the story has a happy ending you are still surprised by how close failure came, repeatedly.<br /><br />  Then, after you have learned how they got here, they take you through all the events of a service (a la A Day At El Bulli, except here it is A Day At Eleven Madison Park). The foodie voyeur and the professional alike will find such detail tantalizing.<br /><br /> Let me disabuse you of the idea that this book is simply a storybook. It is first and foremost a huge collection of accessible, sensible recipes accompanied by detailed photographs highlighting the unique aesthetic of the presentation. The recipes are spectacular because Daniel Humm's food is spectacular. All of the hits are there, from the incomparable chicken roasted with truffles and leeks, to his series of pork dishes (a haiku, if you will, on the possibilities of the pig), to the granola you get when you leave the restaurant. Recipes are organized into four seasons, with the entirety of the menu from each of the four seasons presented as such, with a large (and worth the price alone) collection of base recipes and sources at the end.<br />  Much noise is made by many every time a \\"professional\\" cookbook suchas this one comes out, complaining that the book is not \\"accessible\\" to the every day cook for reasons of ingredient or technique, but in an important way the authors anticipated this. Most of the recipes are easily accomplished with a knife, some pans, and a stove. So called modernist techniques are there, but sparsely and with suitable 'traditional' alternatives presented right there. Sometimes, the chef even points out the technique isn't even necessary at all, and explains the effect it aims to achieve. For example, while acknowledging and describing how sous vide can be used to, say, seal two skate wings together or to prepare an egg, a suitable and completely acceptable home technique is provided alongside that right in the recipe. Wherever liquid nitrogen or a professional ice cream maker is called for the chef invites the reader to make a granita, freezing the ingredient in a pan and then scraping it with a fork to produce the requisite \\"snow.\\"<br />  This speaks to a fundamental truth of Mr. Humm's cooking: he uses regular ingredients, avoids entirely anything chemical or difficult to source (well, sort of, truffles and bee's pollen are in there, sometimes copiously) and his goals with LN2 and sous vide are textural- they involve exchanges of heat easily accomplished (and described in detail every time) with an oven or a stove. There are little things that any home cook will be able to impress with: the soups, the sauces, the garnishes. There are also big things the skilled cook will impress with: everything. This book is a manifesto, a thorough and personal statement about a mature cuisine by a chef in his ascendancy. A fertile imagination can take this book, study the music of Daniel Humm, Will Guidara, and Danny Meyer, and begin to improvise on their own. While we can't all be Miles Davis, its glorious to hear him describe what he's thinking while he plays.omplaining that the book is not \\"accessible\\" to the every day cook for reasons of ingredient or technique, but in an important way the authors anticipated this.

0307987647|4.0|I've recently fallen in love with audio books.  They are great for my long travels.  The narrator is great, though is British accent makes him hard to understand at times.  Great story.  Can't wait to continue to the next book.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|So well done (casting, performances, production values), that though the plot is pretty convoluted, that I didn't mind reviewing it again to get a clearer picture of this mystery straight. Amazon caught me by surprise.  This DVD was shipped and received within a matter of a few days (2-3 days).
0385523912|5.0|I thought this was one of the most interesting and revealing books I have ever read. It contains a detailed, objective account of life inside this secretive state. The picture near the beginning that shows the darkness that descends over nearly all of the country at dusk is incredible. The book is packed full of facts about the ordeals and trials that the common people face. To read that the children only receive presents on \\"The Great Leader's\\" birthday and not their own is sad enough but when you get to the part about the detention centres it really is heart breaking. That said, I feel it is important that we know what goes on behind the facade and for that reason this excellently written book should be compulsory reading.  If you like this, I also recommend the peerless Kate Adie's book, \\"[[ASIN:075531073X The Kindness of Strangers]]\\". Both made deep and lasting impressions on me.
0307454541|4.0|The characters are amazing Lisbeth Salander in most books would be just a bisexual Hacker, thrown in for NCIS type jokes, but Larsson goes deeper, and really ask the question who is this character what makes her be a nonconformist, what are her views on the world, politics sex and most importantly love.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist, is you everyman character, with an edge, he's a good guy in terms of morals, but not when it comes to women and relationships. He holds little value in terms of love.  His best chapters are the ones where his morals are questioned by Lisbeth, their relationship makes this average thriller better.<br /><br /> The problem with the story is<br /><br />1.  It takes far to long for Lisbeth the most interesting character to get involved with the mystery, she pops up here and there where we get back story, but she enters the mystery at like page 250 which is far to long.<br /><br />2. This book has two main plots, one really interesting the mystery of Harriet Vanger, and the other about CEO of a major corporation, and whether or not  he committed Fraud or not, and that it can be proven.  These chapters really dragged, but Larsson does make it pretty easy to follow, and explains the business dealing so everyone can understand.<br /><br />3. The Far more exciting Mystery gets solved way too early, like a 150 pages left too early, the outcome was satisfying I was just waiting for another turn and there was none.<br /><br />I know a lot of people had problems with the swedish names, but the book does a good job of hammering them in, and does not to get too confusing.<br /><br />All in all a good ride with a few bumps, but for a debut novel it's really good.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever watched all the way through. My teen daughter thought it was great, so I didn't want to walk out and hurt her feelings. It was so boring, stupid, and slow.  Save your time and money.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I liked the movie.  Helmsworth does a great job as Thor.  Can't watch without seeking him as Captain Kirk.  Hopkins adds so much to film.  Really enjoyed.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|It was near impossible to put the book down during the the first three books but the fourth one it was hard to pick it up because there was hardly any intrigue, story or that feeling of what happens next. I don't think it was because of the missing characters (though they are sorely missed throughout the book), its also the way the story was told that changed. In the first three books, I would excitedly wait for the next time the story was being told by a particular character but would get so consumed by the next character that wouldn't even mind if the previous character didn't emerge for numerous chapters. Maybe Mr. Martin killed the intriguing characters too quickly/abruptly and had to do with fillers in this one. I just hope the next one is not as bad.
B004NLVMKY|3.0|Through the years The Babys have got my ear for many reasons. It hard rock and it's bubble gum ballads. This time, which is it really ? You'd like to think \\"Head First\\" but as these rockers get a little past their prime, you wonder if sell out is evident. I know this guy can rock but I know what has been his bread and butter. There is so much soft stuff these days and not enough grit. Sure Lou Reed and Metallica are releasing something but which side is more dominant ? Don't get me wrong, I like both. But if any of these old rockers want to break out, they need to forget the top ten and go for the throat. If Waite could go down the Head First road, what rocker wouldn't be satisfied ? But you know the record company wants a little \\"Missing You' and \\"When I see You Smile\\". That doesn't sit well with me. I say do what most rockers have been missing. Rock out for God sake, the worst that could happen is music John will enjoy playing and won't get old. Don't tell me he get's tired of playing \\"Head First\\" , one of the best rocking songs that Aerosmith wish they wrote. Because of the releases title, I will give John benefit of the doubt. I know I will buy it, and I did, because I know what he has done and still can do. Hope is all we have. Leave \\"Missin You\\" with Tina and go full throttle.

B00559B9N8|3.0|I wish there was a way to give feedback on specific editions, because this story deserves 5 stars, but the Kindle edition is really a sloppy one.  Sometimes the meaning of a sentence is really puzzling due to the typos.  It is more like what I expect from a free edition rather than one that cost as much as the paperback.  Buyer beware, and publisher, please make corrections and update!

B004EPYZSU|3.0|\\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" is a fun movie, if not one that'll change your life in any noticeable way. The title pretty much tells you what the movie will be about. Still, it's been so long since we saw a cowboy movie-let alone cowboys who had thoughts that originated above the waist-that I was glad to see men (and woman) a-horseback again.  The movie starts with James Bond waking up in the desert, shoeless, yet accessorized by a really snazzy bracelet. Before he can even stand up, he's accosted by Newly from \\"Gunsmoke\\" who, with his not-too-well-coifed or overly bright sons, tries to take him in assuming the bracelet to be an indication of a prison break. Bond can't remember who he is, but he remembers how to fight and, soon, is riding into town in clothing furnished by Newly & Sons.  In the town he discovers that one of the Carradines is the remarkably upstanding sheriff, the preacher is a sincere but somewhat foul-mouthed person I probably should remember and the bar is run by Guy from \\"Galaxy Quest\\". If that weren't enough trouble, Mutt2 is terrorizing the town because his father, Indiana Jones, is rich and hard and takes in Apaches. The girl from \\"Tron: Legacy\\" is there, too, though it takes a long time to figure out why.  After the old west town is attacked by aliens--who lasso their victims and jerk them into the sky--Bond, Indy and the girl lead a posse of townies, outlaws and Indians into the New Mexico dessert to find them all. If this sounds confusing, it's not, really. But one thing it was, was unpredictable. In spite of the fact that I was thinking the title gave everything away, for the whole movie I never knew what was coming next. When I thought I knew, I was wrong. It turns out that the director who brought us \\"Elf\\" really knows how to tell a story.  I only have two quibbles with this movie. 1] there's too much foul language and it rarely ever serves the plot or the characters well. B] For all the writers of this movie (there are 5 listed and rumor has itmany more could have been credited) I kept thinking how much better it could have been if Louis L'Amour had been around to write it.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Serious drama.  Heart felt but a one time view.  Make sure that you get the best price cause you may not want to watch it more than once.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|I have to agree with the others, while the movie has its merits (and its faults), the bait and switch used in advertising this disc with a \\"digital copy\\" is very frustrating.  Did Warner Bros. lie?  No, of course not, but to say that their advertising for their \\"digital copy\\" was misleading would certainly be accurate.  They, like all of us, know what is meant by \\"digital copy\\" and they did nothing to differentiate between our assumptions and what they delivered.  The movie itself was okay.  Its the kind of story that appeals to children and maybe younger teens, so in a lot of ways, you get what you expect from it.  I wasn't overly fond of it, but my son enjoyed it, so I don't regret the purchase.  Its too bad Warner Bros. felt they had to be so misleading with their \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy.\\"
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I enjoy reading Nicholas Sparks' books.  This one was very predictable and a little cheesey. I'm sorry to say, not worth the time and effort that I put into it.  I might have to take a break from his books for awhile.
B004K7HMJ6|1.0|I couldn't get 30 seconds in to any of her tracks. Maybe the worst \\"album\\" I've ever put in my player.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|First off, I have to say that I am giving it four stars because mine did not come with a scraper nor a clean wipe. I bought this solely to repair my ylod PS3, and it worked. The original thermal paste on the ps3 was white and this is black, not sure if that makes a difference or not. I probably used about half of the tube. If you have a ylod ps3, youtube gilsky's guide. He shows you how to take it apart, apply/fix the thermal paste and put it back together. It did last for a week *with a few hours run time).
B0029LHWFO|5.0|I really admired this courageous and revealing memoir about the President's childhood and young adulthood.  It was beautifully written, and I was impressed with the candor he used to address some extremely personal, painful memories in such an honest way.  He is a man of substance.  I read this before the 2008 election and it was this memoir, along with \\"The Audacity of Hope\\", that persuaded me that Obama was truly a man of deep insight and feeling (contrary to the right wing accusations that people immediately jumped on his bandwagon without finding out anything about him of import).  But what really disgusts me and what is really emblematic of every problem this president has faced is the fact that his authorship has been questioned.  If that's not transparently racist I seriously don't know what is.  There's absolutely no grounds but conjecture on which to base this, and no  one except someone who just doubts the ability of people of African descent to be able to write would have that kind of nerve.  No wonder our country is a mess.  Disgraceful and disgusting.  I'm proud to have this man be our president and anyone who read this and wasn't prejudiced to the point of blindness is, too.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Classic!  A must have.  The fax sequence is pure contempory filming.  The latest in police technology.  It was real!  Good chase scene.  Great leap back in time of San Fran.
B0000027RL|5.0|To cut to the chase:  This is one of the best albums of all time, and the fact that one can listen to it 20 years later and still enjoy it as much as the day it came out is a testament to its strength.  Everyone has their favorites - mine are Black and Porch, with a nod to Evenflow - but there is something here for everyone, and there isn't a single song on the album that one could label even average - it's strong, top to bottom.  Everyone should own this album.
B005GVA2L0|1.0|Don't get me wrong. I love Evanescence. But I have to make my voice heard about cheap packaging. The standard version of this CD comes in a Jewel Case. This Dual CD / DVD version comes in a cardboard mini LP like replica. I have yet to even play the cd and I have ripped the spine of this package trying to get the CD out. It would never survive multiple attempts so I am buying a Dual Jewel Case, scanning the art and being forced to make my own jewel version. I also plan to write a letter to the label, Wind Up.<br /><br />I recommend to anyone interested that you buy the regular CD and download the bonus tracks.  If you want the DVD, I don't know what to tell you except be prepared to have your product packaging fall apart.<br /><br />The main reason that these discs are so hard to remove is that you have to open the bifold and get them from the inside, forcing you to put pressure on the packaging or pull hard to get the discs out.<br /><br />I hate putting a bad review on something for the packaging but in this case I felt it was important.
0525423656|4.0|I know a lot of people didn't like Matched, but I loved it. And the ending of Matched left me hanging so freaking badly. It was a great set up for Crossed.<br /><br />And Crossed definitely dived right into the story. I was playing catch-up for a bit since it's been a while since I read Matched, and there was so much going on.<br /><br />I didn't like the POV change at first. I either wanted to read Cassia's story or Ky's - I didn't like being left hanging with one of their stories and jumping into the other's story. And that usually is how it goes for me with POVs. I don't like it, and then I get used to it. Even though I'm always like \\"Noooo!\\" and want to flip ahead when it ends one POV on a cliffhanger.<br /><br />I, honestly, loved the storyline of Crossed. It was way more survival based that Matched, which I think definitely added a lot to the world Cassia lives in. They're not just stuck in this city - their society has borderlands and outlands and farmland and other cities. And, lots of excitement and danger to be had. Plus, some unexpected (to me) twists.<br /><br />Overall, I liked Crossed a lot, probably even more than Matched. If you were on the fence with Matched, I definitely recommend giving Crossed a shot and seeing how you like it!

B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is a perfect basic case for the iPhone 4S ATT.  For $8.99, it also includes a screen protector.  The case gives good protection all around.

Extra large cut-out around the camera to avoid any flash reflections.  Fit is very snug.  The Amazon logo on the back side of the case is very discreet.  Overall, this case is pretty much fits all my needs.

B003EV6DBM|3.0|This show started off super strong with Eccleston, and continued strong with Tennant.  I don't know.  Smith leaves me with a sweet taste.  TOO sweet.  I perfer a strong doctor, and Smith just came off too clownish, and silly.  With the 6th season he gets a little stronger.  My friend told me it wasn't Smith who's the problem, it was the writing, and it's true: the head writer has changed from Davies to Moffat.  I'm really hoping he'll take the show out of the sand box. There's a lot of really profound themes in Dr Who, but more is spent on fairytale scenes meant for children 8-10 years old.  What I can say? It could be \\"so much better\\".  I hope it'll grow up soon.

B004LROUNG|3.0|I found the style choppy and the cadence that of a newspaper reporter - \\"He did this.  Then he did that.  Then this happened\\" and so on.  However, I did like the story idea.  The last chapters were the best.  The plot was not plausible, but I suspended reality for the sake of the story.<br /><br />He's trying harder at least, even if it is formulaic, its a formula that always worked with his readers in the past.  I paid the high Kindle price for a new hardcover offering, and didn't mind all that much.  The story had much more potential for plot development, but I bought it and read it just to see if this once so very interesting storyteller had revived his skills - and to some extent, he has.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I bought it.

B001DPC52C|5.0|Before I had bought this CD, I never was really a huge fan of Within Temptation (WT). From the moment I popped the DVD in and started listening I knew immediately that this would become my favorite WT album to date. Sharon Den Adel's ability to carry on with such power and haunting melodies is simply amazing. The way that the music is combined with the Symphony creates WT tunes like no one has ever heard them. All in all I love this CD/DVD.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|I Am Legend is the third movie adaptation of the classic Richard Matheson.  I have neither read the book nor seen the earlier adaptations so this was my first exposure to the story.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville, the last man in New York City after a cancer cure gone horribly awry kills most of humanity and leaves most of the people left as what can best be described as vampire-zombies.  Dr. Neville is the rare immune and the even rarer survivor.  Smith is only actor on screen the vast majority of the film, so the film lives or dies by his performance.  Thankfully, it is virtuoso.<br /><br />The strength of the film is the struggle of Dr. Neville, a military scientist, to find a cure for the virus while holding onto his own sanity.  I get stir crazy after three days without human interaction; Dr. Neville spends three years without human interaction.  All this after he sees everything he knew and loved burn away.  It makes for an emotionally brutal movie.<br /><br />Sadly, it is the film's emotional resonance that caused me problems.  It got me to thinking about the movie, which is generally good, but I Am Legend is the kind of movie that doesn't stand up well to close examination.  There are logical holes you could drive a truck through.  Some of this can be chalked up to Dr. Neville's declining sanity, but it's still tough to swallow.  And it's the kind of thing that could have been tightened up with a little more care.<br /><br />CGI is relied upon heavily, but is somewhat hit or miss.  A decaying, partially overgrown New York City is visually arresting and believable.  Apparently a lot of other people don't care for them, but, personally, I'm ok with how the vampire-zombies look.  The deer, on the other hand, were an unwelcome distraction (I kept wondering whether they were some sort of zombie-deer because, well, they didn't look very much like deer).<br /><br />The DVD extras consist entirely of animated comics that take place in the world of I Am Legend parallel to the story of the film.  The comics are very artsy, emotionally gripping, and well written.  One in particular gives us a window into how the vampire-zombies see the world and surviving humans.

1451648537|4.0|This book is very well written and entertaining to read. I have no real interest in Jobs, but the book portrays an extraordinary character. At times I laughed out loud. However, The book suffers from it's immediacy. Much of this information is very current so the book becomes less interesting around page 300, where the time line approaches the mid-late 90's and they start discussing ipod commercials that are still on the air. Not he books fault. This is my first amazon review. I will just say \\"recommended\\". Peace out ya'll!
1451648537|2.0|At first I was excited about the book, having followed the Bill Gates Steve Jobs wars as they unfolded in the 80's. After reading thru the unnecessary four letter works, and LSD trip, which he credits much of his success to, I decided it's not a great book for my kids at all. He was a mad man, used and abused people for his control of perfection, he was not in it for the money.  I have Apple products and I like them,  but I think less of SJ now than ever before! His wife is down to earth, and Wozniak  had a kind heart, too bad more them  did not rub off on SJ. I think he did just as much damage to Apple and the people as he helped them. I think by 40 he started to grow up. It's a sad book, with a happy ending in that I'm thankful I didn't lead such a miserable life! Intelligence with bad character is still bad character. His ego over shadowed his desire to tell the world, his story, something he really shouldn't be all that proud of.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|I enjoyed seeing another story about the X-Men, however, I do wonder just how many times the same story can be repackaged and sold as new again. If there is nothing new to tell there is no need for another movie in this franchise as this one only retells the same story as the many before it.
B004LROUNG|1.0|The story line was interesting. My problem with the book is that so much of it was spent promoting alcohol. I'm sick and tired of haveing alcohol shoved down my throat page after page.

0131103628|5.0|I've been a professional programmer for more than 25 years. There is no such thing as a real programmer who does not have a copy of K&R's C. If you're looking for a job as a software developer in a top-tier firm, you better know C more than anything else, then C++. There are plenty of Java/C# people out there, not enough C/C++ despite strong demand. Ignore all the crappy some-language-in-a-week stuff; if you want to be a high-end software developer, this book is really what you need to start with. Do all the examples from beginning to end and make sure you understand them. The book is written very well, beautiful even, in an easy progression from basic to more advance topics. Then write your own stuff in C. You can easily download free compilers and IDEs for free. This book will teach you really useful techniques that you may find yourself being questioned about in a interview. I've seen books several times the size of his one with half the substance. Get this. Learn it. You'll never look back. Don't bother with any of the rest of the \\"learn C\\" books. Don't forget your algorithms and data structures! That is a separate topic, but goes well with learning C. When you've mastered C, I suggest moving on to Bjarne Stroustup's \\"The C++ Programming Language\\". C++ is an enormous leap from C, but if you truly master C, you will really appreciate C++.

0545123275|3.0|I wasn't in love with the book but I have to admit that it captured my attention. I liked the idea of a supernatural story involving a werewolf instead of a vampire. Plus there weren't any vampires, not even one. I'm hoping they don't pop up in any subsequent volumes either. The protagonist is slightly irritating but I've read far more annoying female characters so I won't complain. Grace is interesting in that she is not completely shallow or brain dead. However, I do have a problem that once she meets Sam she becomes reclusive and ignores her other friends but as a former teenage girl that's probably not an inaccurate portrayal.   The novel is intriguing because there aren't any big action scenes yet there is suspense. The wolves are all well written and interesting in their own way. I look forward to the sequels.
B0000025F7|5.0|In terms of someone like Michael Jackson,different phases of his career will impact on people differently. For some reason this album pretty much locks into my own brain as his general peak of his career. Despite the record breaking success he'd have in the 80's,this album stands as one that says the most about his musical character. We all know the history. Mike meets up with Quincy Jones during the production of [[ASIN:B000XUOLNO The Wiz]],they begin recording this album with the help of some of the biggest musicians and songwriters of the era and so begins a new chapter for him. No longer would Mike's solo career be an adjunct to that of his brothers. And while still a functional member of The Jacksons at the time of this recording,his own self identity was being developed here as well. This album has some very unique hallmarks. It's heavy on production but musically focused. It's sophistifunk of the highest degree but heavier on the funk than the sophistication. Most important,pop considerations are very important here but Mike is not yet defining himself as the King Of Pop.<br /><br />  \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\",which despite may hearings flaunts it's obvious late 70's Barry White influence heavily could'nt be a better way to start this album.\\"Rock With You\\" of course owes it's grooving sleekness in part to Rufus' Bobby Watson's fluid bass line as much as it does to Mike's elastic vocal. Now \\"Working Day And Night\\" is one of the most inspired and strong minded funk jams Mike ever made. He'd never quite got on the one in the same way before or after this. \\"Get On The Floor\\" and the title song both work the disco floor,the former heavier on the funk end and the latter more on the urban dance side moving to the post disco era a bit more. Over the years I always say his cover of McCartney's \\"Girlfriend\\" as a week link but it's a vital straight ahead pop piece with some modern R&B/funk production elements for a little spiciness. \\"She's Out Of My Life\\",a very sad ballad Mike actually cannot keep a dry eye to himself is a rich interpretation of an orchestral,non rhythmic ballad. Of course to my ears the finest ballad tune here is the more midtempo \\"I Can't Help It\\" from Stevie Wonder-featuring both Wonder's unique way with chord progressions and electronics that Mike takes to maximum vocal effect. \\"It's The Falling In Love\\",a midtempo pop/soul type duet with Patti Austin comes to \\"Burn This Disco Out\\",a steamy horn funk closer finding Mike throwing down his best and underused bass vocals.<br /><br />  There are many people who to this day contest that this is Michael Jacksons finest solo album for a musical perspective. And I cannot say there isn't a point there. Something about the music he made with and without his brothers circa 1978-1981 had a certain flavor to it that I don't honestly think he ever fully recaptured. This period,culminating in a way with this and The Jackson's [[ASIN:B001BKMC9K Triumph]],recorded around the same time but released the following year, really allowed Mike to fully take command in interpreting not only his own compositions but be the most involved with the creative environment provided via Quincy Jones and his engineer Bruce Swedien.  This was'nt a Michael Jackson who wasn't very concerned about breaking records,media attention,adulation of fans or indulging in potentially scandalous behavior. This WAS a Michael Jackson who had matured into adulthood creatively. And on that front was in a similarly energized state as he was a decade earlier when the J5 first debut for Motown. As such this album is as much as the conclusion of something as it was a new beginning. And that enthusiastic quality drips from every pore of the music you'll find here.ad Mike actually cannot keep a dry eye to himself is a rich interpretation of an orchestral,non rhythmic ballad.

B005XI96E0|3.0|Christmas albums usually are pretty consistent across the board. Mostly ok songs, a couple standouts and some serious disappointments. Justin Bieber's 'Mistletoe' is no exception.   The title song is a Bruno Mars ripoff melodically, and has Bieber saying 'shawty with you' about 500 times (or at least that's how it seems)   Things are noticeably better on the song 'Only Thing I Ever Get for Christmas' where Bieber celebrates the fact that all he gets for Christmas is his significant other.   'The Christmas Song' suffers from a lot of whats wrong with most R & B renditions of the song. Stretching every verse's ending note only sours the lovely mood of the lyrics.   'Santa Claus Is Coming To Town' allows Justin room to have fun and still be a kid, and he delivers it all perfectly here.  'Fa La La' is a significant accomplishment, but not because of Bieber, who sounds only average here, but Boyz 2 Men make this a song to truly enjoy.   Its a tall order singing with Mariah Carey, but on 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' Bieber rises to the challenge and Carey is surprisingly restrained and resists the urge to stretch notes most of the time.     'Drummer Boy' is without a doubt the absolute worst, most disappointing desecration of one of the most beautiful holiday songs I have ever heard. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to add a tasteless rap after every verse and a club beat and allow Busta Rhymes anywhere near a mic for a holiday song of any kind should be fired on the spot. Disgusting.     'Christmas Eve' is a passable song but doesn't exactly beg repeat playing unless you're in the mood to snuggle with your significant other by a roaring fire.   'All I Want Is You' is one of the album's most positively adult offerings on the album. Here Bieber has shown how he's matured as a singer. Very well done.     'Silent Night' has Bieber singing one of the most lovely, tear inducing versions of the song ever recorded. Here Justin is in top form, exercising mature restraint as he delivers the 2 verses accompanied only by a piano. It's truly all that you need to remind you of the beauty of Christmas.   As far as the extras, 'Christmas Love' is another winner of large proportions. Here he allows his younger teen side mingle with his mature self delivering a nicely put together and highly satisfying mid tempo ballad. What can equal 'Fa La La' for awesome harmonizing? Well, the acapella version of course. I think it actually works even better as an acapella.'Pray' was apparently added just because of its positive messages and religious overtones. 'Someday at Christmas' was obviously recorded when Justin was much younger and his influence here was more akin to the R & B masters of the past rather than the R & B trainwrecks of the present. If only Justin could do more like this, he'd have a 100% hit of a Christmas album.   I just wanna say, all I want for Christmas NEXT YEAR is for Justin to remember the old masters and sing Christmas songs in THEIR style and let the current R & B trash reign as it should, sleeping in heavenly peace. 3.25 out of 5 stars overall.

I wanted the story to be bad and unrealistic. Instead I found it too realistic and became incredibly emotional while reading it. Anyone who has lost someone close to them will be touched by this story but also hurt in a way that I can't understand. Forman writes beautifully and makes the reader root for Mia. I can't imagine anyone not being touched by this book.

0525423656|4.0|I just want to make a three things perfectly clear before I give you my thoughts on this book:<br /><br />1. If you're team Ky, you will love this book<br />2. If you are team Xander, you will love this book<br />3. This is an absolutely amazing story about love, friendship, and fighting for what you believe in.<br /><br />With that said, I will say that I was really worried that I wouldn't love this installment as much as Matched, but I am incredibly pleased to say that this Crossed has exceeded my expectations. Ally Condie's stories are inspirational. Her words are poetic and graceful. The characters are deep, endearing, and as colorful as any reader could hope for.<br /><br />The first three quarters of the book will have you on the edge of your seating wanting to keep reading and wanting Ky and Cassia to find each other. It's so hard to describe what I loved about this book without giving away too much, but I can definitely say that this book is a powerful read that had me in tears at the end. There is redemption, heartbreak, and loss...but the suspense and secrets are what kept me so engaged. The thrills and butterflies of their journey and the fabulously created love triangle are perfection that most authors can only dream of being able to bring to life with their words. But one thing I can attest to - Ally Condie does it and flawlessly.<br /><br />If you loved Matched then you are bound to love Crossed as well. I have fallen in love with the story and the writing in general. The use of classic poems to fuel and inspire the character leaves nothing to be desired in a dystopian society of oppression and conspiracy. I can't wait to see where the story goes next!
B002ZG99TA|4.0|This is a decent action movie, and it's not a small accomplishment that they were able to make the story of a runaway train fairly interesting and quite suspenseful.  The acting is also pretty good, with Denzel Washington delivering as usual, though some of the characters are somewhat cliched.  Also, I do think there's a bit of a plot flaw in the sense that a little creative thinking reveals some easier ways to stop that train, but that's not a major problem since most people probably won't think of these ways during the movie.<br /><br />On a more technical point, I have some professional experience with failure investigation, and I'd like to note that this scenario for developing a runaway train isn't unrealistic.  It may seem too coincidental for so many things to go wrong, both at physical and psychosocial levels, but that's generally how major failures happen.  Such coincidences are rare, and that's why major failures are rare, but in a big and complex world, they're inevitably going to happen now and then.<br /><br />Recommended if you're seeking basic action-oriented entertainment.

1401233376|4.0|FLASHFACT:  This book is pretty neat...  FLASHFACT:....but, sadly, it could have been much better   As all people familiar with DC will know , this book marks the ending of the old DC.  Barry Allen (Flash) one day wakes up to find that the reality , as he (or rather we) knew it, has changed completely...Heroes are either different, or they are villains or they are not there at all! He tries to solve the mystery and his quest to find the truth and restore reality, he meets Batman. I won't go further into details (in order to prevent any spoilers) but in the end things \\"seemingly appear\\" to be fine. (Why I used the words \\"seeming\\" is because the end is the new DC ...and  the old DC is GONE FOREVER..)  I have been reading Geoff Johns' stories for quite sometime now and frankly speaking, this looks as if he had written this half-heartedly...He didn't do proper justice to the story, inspite of the fact that this book is of significant importance..at least a decent closure to DC was required...   Some reasons why I wasn't satisfied with this book:  This book feels like a \\"Flash\\" story ..he's the only main character of the story. Batman's role is considerable but he's second to Flash here...Cyborg is a like a guest appearance...Almost ALL the main characters of DC were ignored...This was really bad..DC has a lot of excellent characters and in the final DC story, it's just the \\"Flash\\" ..there's hardly any villain also ....except for one...(I won't say who it is and spoil the fun...but it should be easy to guess as I've already told that this is just a Flash story).  Also, this event , though it tells about global-disasters doesn't seem much large-scale as it should..That way, \\"Infinite Crisis\\" and \\"Crisis on Infinie Earths\\" were much better.( It may not be fair to compare \\"Flaspoint\\" with these books but fact is that these books were also about reality-changing events.  Many events in the story are told as News broadcasts or through some characters.  The series just starts with a war between Aquaman and Wonderwoman and till the end it's never shown or told as to why this war happened in the first place. Like this, there are many loose ends in the story which, unfortunately are never revelaled. This includes, showing a mysterious lady in the end , when the Flash is trying t restore the timeline. She seems crucial in setting the timeline right but we never get o know who it is. And now since the old DC is over, we'll probably NEVER know who she was...  There are quite a few tie-ins to this book which will be released later on but when the man story itself doesn't live up to expectations, I'm not too keen on reading these tie-ins.( Moreover, from the reviews of individual issues of these tie-ins, that I've read in a popular review website, most of them are pathetic).  In the first four issues of this book , there is hardly any action, it's all mostly conversation. Even in the fifth issue, the action is bit dull, not as exciting as it should be. There is just NO good battle scene between main characters which a reader can say \\"WOW\\".  The story starts fine, continuity is good, even the excitement builds page after page but sadly in the end, it's disappointing. You get the feel \\"much ado over nothing\\" .  Now, inspite of me criticizing this book so much, you must wonder as to why the hell did I give this book a rating of 4?  The main reason is the art. Andy Kubert is just brilliant. I think this is one of his best works ever.His rendering of facial expressions and attention to detail is just marvelous. Even the destruction of some world-renowed monuments have been depicted beautifully. But I must give equal credit to Sandra Hope (Inker) and Alex Sinclair (Colorist).They are both splendid.  Even the quality of paper used in the hardcover is remarkable. Because of all these things , the art simply SHINES in this book and is just one of the BEST  you can see these days.   Another reason I liked this book is because Johns is excellent in characterization. He can just put life in any character he wants. Johns was the reason I started reading \\"Green Lantern\\" and \\"Flash\\". I liked what he did to Aquaman in \\"Brightest day\\" and now, he has just boosted Cyborg's appeal. I had read Cyborg before but I never liked him before..till I read \\"Flashpoint\\"..Like I said, Johns is a genius.   I liked the Batman of this book. In fact I felt he's the best Batman ever! He's one to take a tough stand against crime ...His brand of punishment is simple...kill the guilty! (Though it's not shown but implied).  And if I'm reading any tie-in to this book, it'll probably be the Batman one!  And also, the initial meeting of Flash and Batman is really good...The way in which Flash tries to convince Batman about what has really happened and Batman disbelieving him , is just too good!   Other than these things, there's hardly much in the book...This is probably the most anticipated (DC) book of this year ..and I feel that the DC fans have been cheated ..Johns has just created a story for the heck of it...  The reason he shows as to why the reality got changed and how it it again changes in the end is a bit of a let-down and seems amateurish). I think the entire DC team were busy in preparing for  the new DC (\\"The new 52\\" or whatever) that they completely neglected the old DC..All the years of character-rich and eventful  history of DC  is over..It's sad that at the end also, they (DC  didn't provide a suitable story to justify the end..Anyway, it's all over now...But the good thing is at least it happened! I have been reading DC since a kid and honestly it was tearful for me that they just ended it abruptly.   Anyway, I'll continue to read the (old) DC books and try to lie to myself that it's still not over 

B004EPZ016|5.0|At the 2011 Oscars, an unlikely movie about King George VI speech impediment won the night and surprised everybody with it's ability to turn what seemed to be really boring subject into a winner of a movie. The same may be the case with \\"Moneyball\\", a movie that may be one of the best sports movies of all time and even though it's about baseball, much of the movie takes place in the offices, watching game tapes, crunching stats, making deals and trying to figure out how the Oakland A's, with a budget of $38 million, can compete with the New York Yankees with a budget of 140 million.<br /><br />Brad Pitt gives maybe the best performance of his career as real life Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane, who's own major league fall from grace led him to the front office and to his unorthodox thinking on how to be a winner on a budget. \\"Moneyball\\" is full of talk of stats, jargon, lingo and never once did I think that somebody who could care less about this sort of stuff would not enjoy the movie. The movie, while portraying a real life baseball team trying to survive in a league where top teams can outbid everybody, is constantly hilarious and poignant.<br /><br />While we follow the story of how Billy Beane rebuilds his team using players who have great OBP (on base percentage) the movie also mirrors the life of Billy Beane and how he was touted as a number one draft pick, but fell rapidly from grace, bouncing from team to team and down to the minors before disappearing. This story means a lot in the grand scheme of things and so does the movie as a whole. It's a true underdog story and it shows that the status quo way of thinking, isn't always the correct way of thinking.<br /><br />Moneyball is without question the first movie of the season that will be talked about come oscar time. A brilliant screenplay that just as \\"The King's Speech\\" had to be in order to keep people riveted, Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin did the same with \\"Moneyball\\". You may think it isn't your kind of movie, but it is.

The character of Sue is supposed to be 30 in the show  but looks  close to 50. Her acting is over the top as too is the headmaster. Who wrote these characters ? It is not the fault of the actors  but the creator. The  stories  are always predictable  as well .No surprises in this show. Worst of all is that if they intend to use a gay character  then why can't he be like any other  student - why make him an extremely  queeny character? There are other straight characters in the cast who look gayer that he does  yet they play straight roles.The gay stereotype in GLEE is offensive. Some of the other characters in the Glee club  at least in season one) stay in the background so we only really get to know some of them. What  about the  guy who  is always  seen  playing the piano in every episode. Surely he deserves  a story of his own in the show? After all he is part of the club. GLEE  will appeal fo those  who are not fussy and don't have to think  about the characters or their  situations..
B004HEXSLI|4.0|It is difficult to know how to rate this book. First the good points:  Jill Bolte Taylor is a very brave, educated woman who is a Harvard-trained brain specialist (a neuroanatomist) who suffered a major stroke to the left side of her brain at age 37.  Her professional insights allow her to observe and record what is going on in her brain with exceptional depth.  Anyone who has suffered a stroke, or knows someone who has or knows it runs in their family and they may have a propensity to suffer one, will find great insights in this book.  She goes over the scientific side (with amateurish drawings, I'm afraid) but explains it well.  She also massively covers the emotional side.  I plan to keep this book for a reference for many years.  That's the good part.  On the other hand, the book wanders too deeply into her feelings and sort of a new-age approach of finally being at one with the universe once her analytical side had been silenced by the stroke.  It is important to cover this side but it seems to take up most of the book.  There should have been a lot more editing.  Nevertheless, it is an important book and I will use it for reference in the future even if I have to skip over large chunks of it.  I hope I am not being too harsh.
B002ZG97LK|3.0|Controversy always surrounds movies when it comes to remakes. Should \\"Footloose\\" have been made? Should \\"Psycho\\" have been remade? Absolutely not. \\"Footloose\\" though? Why not? The original is very dated and the elements that made the original \\"Footloose\\" so popular are still as timely and relevant today. It's the music and dancing that brought people to the cinemas back in 1984 for the original \\"Footloose\\" and today, movies like \\"Step Up\\", \\"Save the Last Dance\\" \\"Stomp the Yard\\" and \\"Burlesque\\" are just as popular. Yet \\"Footloose\\" seemed to rise to the top and has been touted as a classic, as far as dance movies go.<br /><br />The new version of \\"Footloose\\" does a lot of things right and I would even go as far as to say that it takes absolutely nothing away from the original movie. They took some liberties with some scenes, putting their own twist on them. Most of the scenes are nearly identical. The script is nearly identical with the exception of the opening minutes that show the audience why the town of Bowmont has banned dancing and other things. Personally, I don't think this adds to the movie at all though. Since the main protagonist is Ren MacCormack, played by Kenny Worwald, a character who is new to the town and doesn't know these people anyway. I think not knowing the victims of the tragedy that caused the law against dancing makes more sense, and adds to the questioning of why the law exists in the first place.<br /><br />Many of the scenes are too choreographed and those scenes take away from the realism and looking glass feel you should get from a movie. For instance, in the new version, the caf&eacute; scene where the minister catches his daughter dancing is a full on blow out, up-in-the-club moment with choreographed craziness. It wasn't realistic and was way overblown. This wasn't always the case. Many of the revamped scenes are well done and much of the music has either been retooled or reused.<br /><br />One of the more popular dance numbers in the original movie is when Wren blows off some steam in the warehouse to the song \\"Never\\". In the new version, the dance choreographer is preserved to a miserable, strange song that doesn't have near the moxie that \\"Never\\" did. Most of the songs are good enough to be memorable though, and Willard learning to dance to the song \\"Let's Hear it for the Boys\\" is one of the best scenes in the movie.<br /><br />The biggest surprise of the movie though was the acting ability of Julianne Hough, who plays Ariel Moore, the preacher's daughter. Hough rose to fame as a dancer on \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and \\"Footloose\\" is only her second movie. She did her part great justice, especially for someone who is a virtual novice. Miles Teller (Rabbit Hole), who plays Willard, also did a great job in only his second movie. In fact, he steals the show in many ways.<br /><br />\\"Footloose\\" is a good movie. It doesn't top the original or pale in comparison to it either. The original had a flow to it that can't be topped when you're trying to duplicate a movie and people like Kevin Bacon and John Lithgow pushed the original over-the-top. Nobody pushes the new version over the top like those two actors did, but the new version will certainly be enjoyed by young audiences of a new generation.blows off some steam in the warehouse to the song \\"Never\\".

159102594X|4.0|In a poll on a very popular fantasy forum (sffworld.com), this 3 book series was voted the top fantasy series by a considerable margin, above A Song Of Fire and Ice and many others.  Its action packed, with gritty, highly developed, incredibly real characters, and written with wit and style.    The series is, clearly, one to read for fantasy fans.  At the same time, its not one of my all time favorites, precisely because of the ways the books differ from traditional fantasy.  Although the characters have this incredible realism to them, you may not actually like them, nor care about which side wins the wars.  Though there is a faction of canibalistic wizards, its not entirely clear that they are wholly evil, and its not like you are ever vested in their defeat.  On the other side, mostly just stands Bayaz, First of the Magi, and he is hard to root for.  I did root - strongly - for many/most of the key characters, but, without giving any spoilers, let me say that this is ultimately an unrewarding exercise, and many characters are ultimately not what you thought, do not change or grow as you expected, or do not necessarily get what they deserve.    In many respects, the plot seems secondary to the characters.  For example, events that took place 1000 years ago are important.  We eventually learn that they did not happen exactly as we were initially told, but never get the details nor the \\"why\\".  The faction of evil wizards claim some sort of moral right, and your left wondering whether there is something to it.  The \\"how\\" as to magic is not explained, and one of the two main characters has a serious double-personality, uncontrollable rage affliction that is never explained either.    It feels like there is a deliberate \\"head fake\\" as to all the characters -- i.e., you are supposed to think one thing, only to eventually learn you were wrong.  Characters that we thought were good guys maybe arent, characters that we thought were changing or growing maybe werent, characters that we thought were strong turn out to be weak (in some ways) and if you assumed there would be happy endings for your favorite characters, well, apparently that is something that experienced Abercrombie readers know to never expected.  I'm all for complex characters, but being deliberately led astray as to so many of the characters was an annoyance to me.  I did root for the main characters for most of the 3 books, but your left realizing that doing so was a mistake.  It seems that fans of the \\"dark fantasy\\" genre cite flawed protagonists as an indication of realism and a plus, but here it seems that Abercrombie is deliberately leading you astray -- leading you to believe that characters are strong/good/changing just so we can achieve a dramatic feel when it turns out they were not.    Maybe dark fantasy isnt entirely my thing, this was my first true \\"dark fantasy\\" series.  While I *loved* the writing and the characters, I did not love the plot, and felt that something important (something/someone to root for) was sacrificed to achieve \\"realism\\".  At the same time, the books and the characters will stay with me a long time, and I could scarcely put the books down.  Verdict:  *Highly* conflicted, but read the books anyway.
B003L77G2Y|3.0|I wrote a review previously where I noted that the delivery of the item was timely, but mid-way thru the 1st disc, the quality began to deteriorate.  Picture starting skipping and the images started breaking up.  I finished playing the disc in another DVD player and got through the 3rd and to the end of the 4th disc and then it finally wouldn't even play at all.  No other trouble until the 5th disc and the same thing started happening.  This is extremely frustrating when you're trying to watch a DVD.  I feel the \\"like new\\" description was misleading.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Ceremonials is a *really* great album.<br /><br />When I was a teenager, I used to sit in my bedroom for hours and listen to music. Sometimes I'd draw, sometimes I'd do homework, sometimes I'd read, but listening to music was the primary activity. As I have gotten older, less and less music has inspired me to devote my full attention to it. Now music has become more of an accompaniment to my life, a sort of background thing.<br /><br />Florence + The Machine changed that- when \\"Lungs\\" first came out, it took back my whole attention. Every time I heard it, I found something new. Every few weeks, my favorite parts of the album would change. I'm still listening to it all the time.<br /><br />Now I feel EXACTLY the same way about \\"Ceremonials\\"- I can't stop listening to it, every time I do I hear something new, and several of the songs give me goosebumps. When I'm away from it, I sing the songs to myself and get excited about being able to turn it back on again. It's sort of like a place I want to keep visiting- I know that sounds hokey, but it's been so long since I've felt so excited about music, I am kind of giddy about it.<br /><br />As a whole, \\"Ceremonials\\" is a bit darker than \\"Lungs\\"- there's less twinkling of the harp (don't get me wrong, there is still plenty of beautiful harp!), less hopeful whispering about happiness, but in its place are soaring moments of Florence Welch's FULL voice (she's a powerhouse) and range. Wow.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Lungs\\" at all, then I would absolutely recommend \\"Ceremonials\\". There's no doubt that Welch is the exception to the rule when it comes to the second album curse- this is the perfect followup to \\"Lungs\\" and not only does it sound perfectly right, it also *feels* perfectly right. It's dreamy and bittersweet and sweeping and epic.<br /><br />I highly highly recommend this album.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|\\"IN TIME\\" is a science fiction escapism film that is set in a time and place where money is no longer the currency, but time. Strange as it may seem, the whole thing felt like a really well done and extended version of a \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode. In an alternate dimension, time and place, wealth is about how much time you have accumulated. The wealthiest of the people can be immortal while the poorest are accustom to waking up each day with 24 hours or even less left on their time ticker and everyone looks to be in their mid-twenties.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that the creators of \\"In Time\\" were fully aware of the parallels they were exploring with time being what we knows as money and as a fewer, those parallels hit home with me. The poor struggle from day to day to add to their life and to make it to the next sunrise by working thankless jobs and doing whatever it takes to survive as long as they can. The poor live a life of urgency as if the slightest mistake could end their lives. Meanwhile, the rich rush nowhere. They aren't worried about anything. They have control over their lives and how long they will live. Most of them will live forever.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake capably plays ghetto regular Will Salas, who has a robin hood type persona, always ready to give up a little of his minutes to help out somebody who's in more need. This personality trait gets him a gift of 100 years and naturally, he moves away from the ghetto, where 100 years could get him killed by somebody wanting his time, to the upscale Greenwich where he meets Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried). Weis is the daughter of the man who holds all the cards, or time.<br /><br />As the story plays out, \\"In Time\\" becomes a mix of \\"Bonnie & Clyde\\" meets \\"Robin Hood\\" and you definitely buy into the reasoning behind their plight.<br /><br />\\"In Time\\" is rich with creativity and sucks you in with skillful storytelling. The depth of its rich story reminded me of the creativity that went into the concepts surrounding \\"The Matrix\\" movie series. It isn't anywhere near as groundbreaking as the original \\"Matrix\\" movie was, but the same suspend belief and enjoy the ride is in place. At times the writing is outstanding and at times the writing is lackluster. At times the direction and settings are creative and entertaining and sometimes cheap and poorly staged.<br /><br />\\"In Time\\" could have been better had it been more polished in certain areas, but it is by no means a deal breaker. It is certainly a movie that people who love quality science fiction in the tradition of the \\"Twilight Zone\\" or movies of the 70s will enjoy. It isn't a special effects extravaganza and that's part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. It isn't trying to bribe people into liking it.

1904920209|3.0|I agree that this is a beautiful book; the photos are delectable. However, the recipes have been written using fresh yeast. This is impossible to find in the area where I live (granted I'm not in a sophisticated market), therefore the book is rendered practically useless for me. I have taken professional cooking courses and have a book which helps with making the conversions necessary to use dried yeast, but really, why bother? Are Bertinet's recipes so superior that jumping through those hoops is worthwhile? The book has gotten good reviews but I'll have to put it aside for any number of other fabulous bread making books which call for ingredients I have readily available, such as Hertzberg & Francois's Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day. The time factor is not the critical thing for me - I have plenty of time to bake bread. The wonderful thing about that book is the quality of the product. When that's combined with the ease of the recipes, it makes me wonder why any one buys commercial bread. I very much wanted to like Bertinet's book, but it hasn't happened for me.
B004A8ZWWE|3.0|There is a formula that usually comes with fight movies and as clich&eacute; and predictable as it is, it apparently works. It has been proven over and over with the \\"Rocky\\" and \\"Karate Kid\\" movies. Quite honestly, it would be a waste of time to list them all. Yet, throughout time, people still love them, regardless of the fact the scripts are as predictable as Monday morning. \\"Real Steel\\" is no different. The only difference in \\"Real Steel\\" is that it is set in the near future where humans no longer stand in the ring getting hit, but giant rockem' sockem' robots with quite a bit more mobility are doing the dirty work.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, a former boxer and presently a low-life swindler who is in deep to numerous debt collectors. In his desperation to scramble up money to keep going in the robot boxing business, he is willing to risk everything at a moments notice and has no desire to know or have custody of a son named Max (Dakota Goyo). He is so void of anything moral, he takes a $50,000 bribe in order to take his son for one summer and sign away his parental rights to the mother's Aunt. See where this is going? I did, too.<br /><br />\\"Real Steel\\" is full of clich&eacute; and predictability from beginning to end. There is a mountain of things to criticize. There is very thin development of the relationship between father and son, yet that storyline holds the purse strings. The final battle is not just similar to \\"Rocky\\", it is nearly a mirror of the movie \\"Rocky\\", all the way up to the `Adrian!' moment. I believe I even heard a few notes of the same song that ended the movie \\"Rocky\\" at the end of \\"Real Steel\\". The bad guys in the film are so clich&eacute; and over the top, it nearly ruined it for me. They are the stereotypical bad guys from the fight movies; the 'Cobra Kai' from \\"Karate Kid\\", `Drago' from \\"Rocky 3\\", except even more over the top.<br /><br />All that being said, the fight movie formula works. The robot animation is spectacular and realistic. It is a spectacle movie and if you want to see something like that, then \\"Real Steel\\" will not disappoint. It is entertaining from beginning to end and will be a great movie for those who don't mind the fact that its script has been done many times before. If you're looking for something deep and thought provoking, or unpredictable, look elsewhere.nd if you want to see something like that, then \\"Real Steel\\" will not disappoint.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Wow!! This novel had so much hype that I was skeptical, so skeptical, but it really lived up to the hype for me. I found myself highlighting and rereading many sections. The characters draw you in and make you feel for them. I have visions of what they would look like on a big screen. I almost hope that someone does make this into a movie, but if they do I hope they don't screw it up and miscast it. I'm especially fond of...well I actually really think all the characters are human and flawed and likable. But the story of Bailey and Poppet would be a wonder to explore further, but not at the expense of Widget, or Celia and Marco..and a back story of Kiko, or a whole story of Isobel. So many characters to explore.
1423140591|4.0|It goes along with the rest of the series. The only thing I really dilike was that it had a semi-slow beginning, in that yes percy lost his memory, but it was like there was a constant \\"i don't know I've lost my memory\\" It changed back and forth from the characters just as it did in the last which I had to pay more attention to so that I wasn't confused.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|One of the things I really liked about Lungs was the way Florence really went for it: she's got a big voice, and she constructs big songs to support it. It's not surprising, given that album's success, that she takes that approach again on Ceremonials. If anything, she pushes it even further. These songs have soaring vocals, pounding rhythms, and layers upon layers of lush, gorgeous instrumentation. It's a rare thing indeed for an artist to be both popular, talented, and intelligent, but Florence + the Machine has really got it all. Sure, it can seem overly melodramatic at times, but that's part of the charm. This is big, insistent music from one of the standout artists of the past few years.<br /><br />The additional tracks on the deluxe edition are well worth the extra few bucks, too. When it comes to Florence + the Machine, bigger is better, so an expanded 16 track playlist is definitely something I'm glad to have in my collection. I find myself wondering where she'll go from here. Will the songs be dramatically different next time around, or is this the sound she wants to settle into for good? Time will tell, but for now I'm happy to enjoy and appreciate what we've got right now. There's nothing quite like the experience of listening to a musician (a true artist, no less) in her heyday. Florence is in her prime right now. May it last many years.
0446547654|3.0|The Best of Me is about a couple who comes from different back grounds so of course there are going to be issues.  Amanda is from a wealthy well to do family and Dawson is from a family that's involved in criminal active.  Somehow the two of them fall in love and try to go against the odds, but in the end, Dawson breaks up with Amanda so that she can have a better life then the one he thinks she'd have with him.  When a mutual friend passes away, the two are brought back together after years and years of not seeing each other.  Both have their own lives, but now the question comes, will they be able to have the life together they never got.  This was not my favorite book by Nicholas Sparks.  It read somewhat fast as all his books do, but it was slow moving with the action of what was happening.  Then there were a few things that seemed to similar to his last book, like the guy that Dawson kept seeing.  And towards the end, things just started to get put in like everything needed to be done in a hurry to add it into the book.  I didn't really love either of the main characters, but did think that Dawson was a good guy, trying to the right things in his life.  Amanda was kind of a boring character.  She had a lot going on in her life, but she didn't jump off the pages to me.  The other thing I didn't like was how several POV's were just added in the book whenever and some could have been cut out since they didn't have anything to do with Dawson and Amanda, who the book was about.  As usual, the ending became predicable and I really didn't like how it ended.    I did like that Dawson wasn't a straight laced character and that he was interesting and of course the relationship between him and Amanda was one that you hoped things would work out in some way for them after reading everything about their lives.  I like Nicholas Sparks and will read his next book, but I won't be reading this one again anytime soon.
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|After listening to this album, i find a lack of surprise. The combination of Metallica and Lou Reed was at best an entertaining thought.

B002ZG99QS|2.0|\\"Anti-capitalism and anti-technology have now entered the perfect hypothetical environment from which to attack reality ? all thanks, paradoxically, to the massive financial and creative resources of Disney Corporation.<br /><br />Complex plot reversals and revisionist history only draw more attention to the twisting of the truth. This extreme exaggeration between several moral contradictions in the new Tron actually offers an amazing opportunity to examine Hollywood chasing its own CGI 3D tail on the global 150-million-dollar scale: Any of the soul, humor, or innocence of the original is finally displaced by faith and force.\\" - Andy George<br /><br />I was saddened to see such a beautiful, and expensive work of art, wasted on the philosophy of overt Marxism that this film embodies.

B0051BNRTO|4.0|Mostly what I remember about reading this book is snickering or laughing out loud during reading, which would prompt odd looks on my lunch breaks. Nick Hornby is always clever and witty, but here he takes the perspective of three different characters who are evaluating their lives for different reasons and the catalyst is a re-released, stripped-down version of a moderately admired musician's last album. I love what it says about music/pop culture and its effect on normal lives, as well as how it looks at what the artist's take on their own work might be decades later. And anytime you get to watch grown-ups turn back into teenagers, agonizing over the sending of an email, well, it's a good time. Not life-changing, this book, but still highly recommended.

Would not recommend this, or any other lower end Sekio.
B00422LESO|4.0|A modern day tale Austen fans will truly adore, Shannon Hale brings humor, romance and charm to this fabulous ode to Jane Austen. In true Shannon Hale form, she creates an adorable story that is fun, and engaging as she took me along on Jane Hayes's little adventure. Jane Hayes is a character many Jane Austen fans will relate to. She's obsessed with Mr. Darcy. I mean obsessed to the point she hides her BB Pride & Prejudice watching, book reading addiction from everyone. Which is all the more reason why I love her. Who can blame her for love that little movie that many fans adore played by a certain British heart throb named Colin Firth. Certainly not this Mundie Moms. But, there's a tiny problem with being that obsessed with Mr Darcy and I'm sure many of us book fans can relate to this.... Mr. Darcy is fictional, but to a thirty something, single year old women who's looking for that perfect Mr. Darcy, Jane can't seem to find \\"the right\\" guy, because her sites are set on the fictional Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />When Jane's aunt passes away, she leaves behind a gift for Jane, a trip to London for an exclusive vacation at the Pembrook Park. Any Austen fan would LOVE this trip! This park takes their guests back in time to Austen's era. Sounds like one of those fabulous get away from it all trips doesn't it? I know I'd enjoy that, but once Jane is there, I started to really sympathize with her. Every moment of the day and night you have to act like you're apart of this time period. You act the part, dress the part and during the duration of your your stay, you are apart of this time period. There's even balls to attend to do. Sounds fabulous right? There's also strict rules like no talking to the servants, no modern day devices, women aren't allowed to be with a man alone unless they're outside and in motion, women aren't allowed to roam freely about after dark and so on. It's during this time that Jane's love for this era starts to make her feel like an outsider, someone who doesn't fit in.<br /><br />Don't worry, Jane definitely finds herself in some rather hilarious circumstances and of course Hale provides the right amount of romance that kept me completely hooked on this fabulously written story. Word of caution, do not pick this book up thinking it's a re-telling of a classic, it's far from it. It's simply a wonderful story that all Austen fans will enjoy, and Hale gives us fans something to swoon over and connect with in Jane. I am really looking forward to the sequel, Midnight in Austenland that releases next year. If you've ever wandered what it would be like to live in Jane Austen's time period, than I highly recommend picking up this fabulous clean cut book. You might want to read it before the movie comes out!!o doesn't fit in.<br /><br />Don't worry, Jane definitely finds herself in some rather hilarious circumstances and of course Hale provides the right amount of romance that kept me completely hooked on this fabulously written story.

B003Y5H574|5.0|I don't understand why some people dumped on this movie.  I really enjoyed it.  It's raunchy in parts, but no worse than most of what is on TV these days.  Or the \\"40 Year Old Virgin\\" for that matter.  Marisa Tomei, Emma Stone, Steve Carrel, Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling... all truly interesting characters.  Very very funny , IMO. I laughed a LOT.   But it's NOT \\"Little House on the Prairie\\"... or Saw {1-n}
0525423656|4.0|Talk about a fabulous sequel, this is one exciting read that lived up to it's hype for me! CROSSED delivers more suspense, romance, action, and a lot of unexpected wonderful surprises. Wow, I didn't see some of those twists coming. I loved what Ally did in CROSSED. She not only amps up the relationship between Ky and Cassia, but half the story is told from Ky's point of view. I loved the alternating points of views.<br /><br />CROSSED introduces fans of the series to a whole new world, new characters and new dangers. There's nice little twists on some characters I loved and some shocking secrets are revealed. The world is just as dangerous and still just as fascinating at it was in MATCHED and I liked getting to see a different part of this series' setting. It made the journey that Cassie and Ky attempt that much more exciting. Everything was new, even though there was some of the same threats still existed within the Society. I liked learning more about the places each of the characters was sent to work in. The characters were just as intriguing as they were in MATCHED. I liked that the newer characters and even the older ones un-nerved me a bit with the secrets some of them have. It kept me on my toes and it made me look at Cassie, Ky and Xander differently.<br /><br />CROSSED has left me feeling just as torn on who I want Cassia to choose as MATCHED did. Don't get me wrong, this story had me rooting for Ky more than ever, but then there's a part of me that's still cheering Xander on too. I loved how drawn Ky and Cassia are to each other. I completely sympathize with what Cassia is feeling and how torn she is with Ky and Xander. Her feelings for both guys are very believable. I liked that she wrestled around which what she would get if she settled with either one of them. I enjoyed seeing both guys from a different perspective. They're not as perfect as I thought they were (really no one), and I liked being able to see the characters from a different point of view.<br /><br />CROSSED definitely delivers a whole new set of feelings, twists and turns and plenty of excitement to this series. I highly recommend picking up this thrilling, must have sequel. I'm really looking forward to reading the final installment in this trilogy. I can only imagine what shocking twists Ally has in store for us. Go pick up CROSSED today and make sure to join us next week when we host a CROSSED tour stop..<br /><br />CROSSED definitely delivers a whole new set of feelings, twists and turns and plenty of excitement to this series.

1416583432|5.0|Outside of a dog, a book is man's been friend,<br />Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read.<br /><br />Those words of wisdom, attributed to Groucho Marx, are quoted by Alexandra Horowitz, author of Inside of a Dog, What Dogs See, Smell and Know (Scribner). The book delves delightfully into the inside workings of a dog. Horowitz often refers to a dog's umwelt, a German word meaning environment or surrounding world. Through this authoritative and captivating book, we learn what the world looks like from a dog's point of view.<br /><br />Alexandra Horowitz, a cognitive scientist, explains how dogs perceive their worlds. Dogs are decedents of wolves but through breeding vast differences now exist. The author shows us what the world must look like through a dogs eyes and describes the actual construction of their eyes. She discusses the noise a dog makes and what it might mean. We might think of a dog licking our face as kisses, but what does it mean do a dog? You don't want to know.<br /><br />For me, one of the book's most interesting discussions deals with dogs' incredible sense of smell. A dog can sort with minute detail the information presented through his nose. Bloodhounds, supersmellers among dogs, can detect small changes in odor, such as a diminishing smell in footsteps over time. The bloodhounds large ears facilitate his sense of smell. By gently shaking his head, he can stir up more scented air for the nose to catch. The medical field recognizes the ability of dogs to detect distinctive smells of various infections, diabetes, cancer or even schizophrenia.<br /><br />Horowitz backs up her facts with scientific research and presents it in useful context. Inside of a Dog is scholarly, yet a fun, witty read with practical application for dog lovers interested in knowing why their dogs act the way they do.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|As a Civil War buff I found this film to be by and large very accurate. It's not a documentary but my research shows a very accurate portrayal of the assasination of Abraham Lincoln and the trial of those involved in his assasination. The movie centers on Mary Surratt's defense at the military tribunal and the subsequent hanging of the Lincoln conspirators. I feel the movie did an excellent job of portraying all aspects of that moment in our nation's history.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I was almost worried that Florence wouldn't be able to follow up on her absolutely perfect debut, but listening to the album (For the 6th time now) all of my fears have been eradicated. Absolutely stunning vocals and lyrics swell beautifully with dark, haunting, and exciting music, with the instrumentation flowing so perfectly into the songs!  This album easily tops Lungs' stunning sound and expands upon it. If you loved Lungs, you will love this even more, of this I have little doubt.  Only If For A Night - A stunning opener, which starts off softly with 'And I had a dream/about my my old school/and she was there all pink and gold and glittering', and those three lines just leave me feeling nostalgic already, as Florence thinks about her past. The music swells into the wonderful chorus, making this song the perfect opener.  Shake It Out - The second single released thus far, and lots of fun to listen to. A far more 'dancy' tune then some of the others, even with the really dark lyrics. The deep organ sound at the start really carries the song along. 'It's always darkest before the dawn...' Florence calls, as the song picks up, and the song's central thought it revealed, albeit through an exciting tune. Great song.  What the Water Gave Me - The first single, and possiblity my favorite Florence track of all time. The song, at over 5:30 long, is a winding stunner, as Florence croons about drowning herself 'Cuz they took your loved ones, but will return them in exchange for you'. She explains why she must die, and that 'she's a crueler mistress, and a bargain must be made'. Powerful lyrics, powerful vocals, haunting melodies, and amazing music tops my music list for quite awhile.  Never Let Me Go - The beginning of the track confused me for a minute, before I really started getting into this one. A rather slow one from Florence, opening with a soft piano track and only faint drums to carry it along, alongside loads of harmony from Florence, and a loving, sweeping chorus.  Breaking Down - Starts with what sounds like a harpsichord, with a bouncy drum track, and never lets up from there. I was reluctant at first, but the harpsichord sounds proved addicted, and I'm really loving this song now. The echoing sound from Florence's voice in this one is wonderful!  Lover to Lover - Easily one of the most dance-worthy songs on the album, it sounds quite a lot like an old gospel song, which Florence's giant voice fills perfectly. The jazzy piano and the clever harmonies work wonders.  No Light, No Light - The opening of this one really kept me on my toes, as I had no idea where this one was going. The verses are so different from the chorus, but they work together wonderfully, in a big, open-space, song.  Seven Devils - Oh my god, one of the most haunting songs I've ever heard. One of my favorites. The lilting, creepy, fearful edge of the piano and strongs, conbined with a urgent sense in Florence's voice equates to one of the most stunning songs on here.  Heartlines - An aching song of what seems like some sort of love, as Florence sings over a thrumming bass line and pounding drums, with a sparkle of harp on the edges. The powerful chorus is just amazing!  Spectrum - Opening with a soft humming high violin note, as Florence sings softly over the soft music. Florence's wodnerful voice really shows its range, as we move into the throbbing chorus, settling down as the song moves to a close.  All This and Heaven Too - A quicker song, opening with sparse intrumentals, before moving into a driving chorus, as the background vocalless singing carries the song beautifully.  Leave My Body - Opens creepily, and when Florence begins to sing, the song continues the almost creepy edge, but cools off a bit, intul we pull into the haunting chorus, as Florence croons 'I'm gonna leave my body, I'm gonna lose my mind...'  Remain Nameless - Opens with a deep bass line, computerized drum beats, and echoing, haunting vocals. Sparse intrumentation, with a creepy drive the entire time, as Florence sings about how she wishes to 'remain nameless... Live without shame...\\". The music keeps to a stready thrum in the background during much of the song, focusing mostly on Florence's vocals and lyrics. This one has a great dance beat though, and really manages to be amazing.  Strangeness and Charm - Relentless voice, relentless music. Just plain fun, with a driving beat, loads of vocals, and a sweeping chorus. I'm glad I got the bonus tracks, especially because of this.  Bedroom Hymns - Really fun beat at the start, with a distorted electric guitar. Florence's vocals come in quickly, and carry the song on a long jaunty path. Definently has a religious feel to the song, as Florence sings about 'Jesus on the mind', and how she's 'already on her knees', as the song sweeps forward.  What the Water Gave Me (Demo) - A really interesting version of What the Water Gave Me. It starts with more of a synthesized song, instead of the sweeping music in the actual version, that makes this version sound more like a techno remix rather then a Demo. Fun nevertheless, but this one actually puts the emphasis on the chorus rather then the verses, which the actual song does in reverse.  Overall an amazing album. I'm so happy with it, and believe this is my favorite album this year.

B004RFYEEC|5.0|This set reinforces one thing above all others: the vocal work Brian was experimenting with is clearly ahead of anything else before or since. No one sings like this. No one.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|Not much new here for anyone that has kept up with the computer industry for the time frame involved.  I've not read many bio's so maybe they're all this way?  But, just keeps going over the key points over and over,,,like we the reader couldn't come to our own conclusions?  very Steve like,,,this is how you will read my book)  Also very Steve like,,,,you will not loan this book.  Why punish kindle users?

Not only was I unaware of his musical talent but when he partnered up with some New Orlean greats, it was out of this world.  Laurie shares this once in a lifetime  experience with us on this CD and it is terrific!

0525423656|5.0|*minor MATCHED spoiler*<br />The end of Matched was completely heart-breaking for me... traumatic if you will! They haul Ky away and Cassia's world basically folds in on itself as everything she has ever known about life and the Society seems to crumble.<br /><br />Crossed opens with a chapter from Ky's perspective, he's standing in a river that the Society has convinced people is poisonous... so no one ever tries to cross it. I am filled completely with despair while he is forced to dispose of a dead body of an aberration- like himself...<br /><br />He is barely surviving at the \\"camp\\" in which he is being imprisoned. Ky and the others in the camp are used as human decoys in daily attacks on their \\"village\\". With barely enough food and water to survive, much less defend themselves with the FAKE weapons the Society gave them... his fellow Aberrations fall around him from starvation, dehydration or bullets.<br /><br />Cassia has been moved from work camp to work camp, hoping for her chance to escape in order to search for Ky. The morning comes in which she is to be moved to her permanent placement, and Soldiers come for two of her bunk mates- one of them runs. Cassia can only hope she makes it and pray that where ever the Society plans to drop her is closer to Ky...<br /><br />  \\"Ky is heavy in my mind, deep in my heart, his palm warm on my empty hands. I have to try and find him. Loving him gave me wings and all my work has given me the strength to move them.\\" ~Cassia<br /><br />Only instead of being placed in a permanent work position, Cassia is sent to a DECOY camp... the same one that Ky had escaped from two days earlier! I know!!!<br /><br />All the while Cassia journeys to find Ky, she writing him a poem in her head (this is NOT cheesy... if you've read the first book, you'll understand it's significance.) These were the lines that stuck with me:<br /><br />  \\"I climbed into the dark for you<br />  Are you waiting in the stars for me?\\"<br /><br />Xander plays little in the thick of this book, but I have a feeling that in the third installment... all the small things will come together ans end up turning into something much bigger for Xander and Cassia. *ahem... Team Ky* ;)<br /><br />Despite all the horrible things Cassia is going through, she doesn't break. She simply FIGHTS. She holds her head up against the Society, and all but gives them the finger. Obstacle after obstacle, hurdle after hurdle Cassia manages to come out on top. Does she find Ky only to lose him all over again? Will small deceptions turn into larger betrayals? And more importantly, will they be forgiven?<br /><br />I LOVED how much Cassia grew and learned about herself from Matched to Crossed.. Ky may have taught her that she COULD do things, but she knows now that she can do them HERSELF.all the small things will come together ans end up turning into something much bigger for Xander and Cassia. *ahem...

B005D9MUWY|3.0|Much better than default Android keyboard, but stopped working. I only get default keyboard even tho Swiftkey is selected in settings, even after reinstall &amp; update.

This is definitly a show for adults, I would not recommend it for anybody under 18 yrs old but I recommend it to any adult who likes a good plot and plenty of excitement with some good ole shootouts?The dvd series arrived on the day they said it would and it arrived in excellent condition?  The cost of overnight service was actually reasonable for a change too? Thank you Amazon! I will continue to be a happy, loyal, and repeat Amazon Customer! Sincerely, Tammy M.

B005LRWRZ8|4.0|I have been following the mighty Megadeth since 1990 and it never ceases to amaze me how consistent Dave Mustaine is. Ever since the comeback from Risk 10 years ago. Megadeth has released solid to great albums with Endgame and System Has Failed being highlights for me. Th1rt3en is a very solid album from beginning to end. The only weak track is Who's Life Is It Anyway? All other songs are good to great. If you liked Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia you won't be disappointed.

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Sons of Anarchy Seaon 2 is even better than season 1? I hardly ever give tv shows of today a five star rating because they are often silly and have no story line? Sons of Anarchy is a racey, strong, adult show that deals with a bunch of men in a motorcycle club who have moved themselves in a bad direction with guns, drugs, and the cartel? But you cannot help but watch and wonder how will they ever straighten up and go the right way and do the right things for themselves and their families. I had this shipped from Amazon for two day delivery and it arrived one day EARLY and in excelllent condition? Thanks again Amazon for another fantastic Dvd collection? Again, I am a very satified return Amazon Customer! Sincerely, Tammy M.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|The first several episodes were excellent, but then someone who puts this show together thought it would good to include a subplot about Tara and her alcoholic mother.  Unfortunately, WAY too much time is spent on this. This is a show about vampires, and the first season is about several murders.  So why does Tara and messed up mom get 20 - 25% of airtime? It makes no sense. Even if this is somehow important to the second season, they could have shortened it.  Other annoying aspects of this season are the juvenile relationships between Sookie and her suitors and the very stereotyped characters.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|You'd think that 2 Rock and Roll Hall of Famers would know how to make music. Wrong. This is the worst pile of garbage my ears have been unfortunate enough to hear. Horrible collaboration. Dave Mustaine asked Metallica if they wanted to collaborate and they did'nt respond, just did'nt bother t consider the suggestion. It shows how out of touch Metallica is with the world. When a founding member of Metallica asks to reunite to say YES. That would be unbelievable to see and hear. Dave would slap Hetfield and Ulrich back into shape.
B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|Excellent DVD, but wish they'd shown more of the deleted scenes and bloopers.  Nice to see the tribute to the original, and see the places where they shot everything.  Good to see the behind the scenes on the pilot.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved all three books in the Millenium Trilogy. The books were well-written, well-researched, and as a woman, I was pleased at how the author dealt with the issues of inequality for women and under-represented groups, specifically those who are below the poverty line and find themselves wards of the government.  The series speaks to people in a multitude of ways on many different philosophical and moral issues.  Bravo!

B005LJITS0|2.0|Green Lantern is a study in how not to adapt a comic book hero to film.  The way they portray the Green Lantern's powers remind me a a lot of The Mask -- you know, all those goofy scenes when the Mask pulls out a giant-sized animated Tommy gun and starts mowing down all the bad guys.  In Mask, it's funny.  I'm just not sure they were going for funny with Green Lantern.  Very cartoonish.<br /><br />There are a few points along the way when the plot picks up and it's actually pretty entertaining.  The basic storyline starts (no spoilers) with a dying alien who passes on his special powers to a human.  This human, who doesn't really understand what has happened to him, suddenly finds himself in the middle of an intergalactic battle.  The villain is actually entertaining, and the \\"other world\\" had some real potential too.  There is actually a pretty good backstory that starts to develop.  The problem is that the story keeps lapsing back into those bizarre animated sequences and you find yourself dropping straight out of movie.<br /><br />The casting was weak too and the Green Lantern's costume was awful.  Now, I know it's odd to comment on something like a costume, but you can't help but notice.  When Green Lantern puts on his mask and tights, he doesn't look cool at all.  I found myself have flashbacks to Will Ferrell in Elf.  It's downright comical but I'm pretty sure it wasn't supposed to be, which is what makes it sort of tragic.<br /><br />Generally I like the superhero movies but this one just didn't work for me.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Best way to waste my time in years! I like the change up from the pigs. Laughing monkeys and birds in cages is a good way to keep things fresh. I played the free version for awhile but the ads are annoying and this game is more than worth the price

B0053YGYO4|4.0|REVIEW: Coldplay  -  Mylo Xyloto - 2011 - 8.5 out of 10<br /><br />Review Summary: Some great tracks, very heavy production, catchy and up-beat at times, classic mellow Coldplay at other times. Feels like a less potent sequel to Viva la Vida, but worth owning for any Coldplay fans or fans of modern melodic rock (e.g. Snow Patrol.) I have Viva la Vida a 9.5 out of 10, this is an 8.5.  Looking forward to another fantastic Coldplay tour! These songs will play well live.<br /><br />**********Full Length Review**********<br /><br />It's hard for me to review a new Coldplay album.  After traveling across the country to see multiple amazing Viva La Vida concerts, I could not imagine them topping Viva. Memories of walking out of an arena in 2009 and 2010 with thousands of people chanting Viva's \\"Ohh-oh-whow-Ohh-oh, Ohha-wah-uhh-Oh\\" still gives me chills.  Not since U2 did the their threesome mix live of \\"Bad-40-Where the Streets Have No Name\\", have I ever felt so part of a live song.  When Rolling Stone first compared Coldplay to U2 (favorably) around 2002, I was aghast.  By 2008, I was traveling far and wide to see them live.  Entertainment Weekly recently praised Viva as one of the decades best records.<br /><br />Their catalog already has so many classics, \\"Clocks,\\" \\"The Scientist,\\" \\"Fix You\\" to name a few.  We have the more recent additions of \\"Viva la Vida,\\" \\"Lost\\" and even \\"42,\\"---all from 2008s Viva La Vida.  Their 42 has no relationship with U2's 40.)<br /><br />The triumphant anthem that is \\"Viva la Vida\\" may be hard to top.  It's their \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" timeless, modern and classic all at once.  Like U2, they may never top their best entre, but you can still enjoy the new dishes they serve up.  My first listen to Mylo Xyloto (MX) did not impress me.  I had heard a couple tunes already, \\"Teardrop\\" and \\"Paradise\\" and felt like it was bonus material from Viva, not a whole new adventure. Now, after 6 listenings, I can get my arms around this oddly titled album--which is named to reflect how \\"music exudes from the human body and toes.\\"<br /><br />MX is very good, not great, but has great moments.  Its high moments are not quite as high as Viva, nor are its lows very low. It's a solid sound for 2011 and an easy and up-beat addition to their great catalog. Ironically, I hear a lot of U2-style influence, particularly on guitar on MX, and maybe a little 80s new wave.  Like many albums, there is a stark trade-off between highly produced \\"easy to listen to\\" music and authentic \\"raw-ness.\\" In 2011, the band opted for \\"ease of listening\\" and thus it feels a bit heavy with layers of production, keyboards, reverb, background sounds, rhythm guitars, etc.  Viva was a bit over-produced too, but certain songs had a raw edge that pulled them into fantastic live performances.<br /><br />Overall, I felt Viva la Vida was a 9.5/10.  So far, MZ feels like an 8.5/10.  It's praise-worthy and fun, but not perfect.  This is in part because we only get 45 minutes from 14 tracks. That's an average of about 3 minutes per track, only four tracks break the 4 minute mark, but there are a couple very short \\"interlude\\" tracks too.<br /><br />TRACK BY TRACK : For those who want a track-by-track review, here you go:<br /><br />1) Mylo Xyloto: A short introduction instrumental.  Tries to pull the whole album together (think Days of Future Passed from the Moody Blues).  It works as an intro, but has no stand-alone value. I rate this song a 7 out of 10.<br /><br />2) Hurts Live Heaven: Fun, upbeat, clever lyrics, and overall very engaging.  The vocals and guitar grove make this a standout song, one you will love to hear live and potentially a radio song. Classic Coldplay. 9/10.<br /><br />3) Paradise:  A bid soft a fluffy as a radio single, but very smooth and friendly.  Good orchestration, heavy keyboards, and a warm lounge feel save this from being background music.  8/10.<br /><br />4) Charlie Brown: Many parts of this song have a U2/Achtung Babyvibe--quite a compliment.  Great beat and lyrics--this song has anthemic qualities and is another standout and memorable track. 9.5/10<br /><br />5) Up Against the World: Feels like old acoustic Coldplay.  The building anthem qualities again make this authentic Coldplay and a strong track.

I am sure somebody said \\"leave that track off the album\\" and I may agree. Their attempt to \\"rock out\\" here with the same lyrics repeated and 90s \\"Bono-style\\" screech-singing feels mis-place and loud.  The \\"Edge-style\\" guitars are great, but the layers of production are too much. It may grow on me, once I stop hitting \\"skip.\\"  6/10.<br /><br />9) U.F.O.: A chilled out, old school Coldplay track. It feels like it has the potential to grow on the listener and probably will, but for now it feels mushy. 7/10<br /><br />10) Princess of China: Coldplay meets Rihanna.  Sounds too poppy, but it actually works pretty well.  The band ads a groovy beat and keyboard riff to get your head bumpin'.  This may be a big hit for them. It's a bit too radio-friendly, but it's got a lot of soul. It sure wants to be a big track.  Great beat, keyboard and vocals--while still holding true to Coldplay complexity. Vocal chants border of Viva catchiness. 9.5/10.<br /><br />11  Up In Flames: Simple, yet complex. Soft and smooth with a very catchy chorus.  Very good, but not sure what it wants to be when it grows up. 8/10<br /><br />12  A Hopeful Transmission: Another interlude track with a very short instrumental lead-in to the next track.  Serves a purpose, but very sleepily.  6/10.<br /><br />13  Don't Let It Break Your Heart: Fun and very upbeat, but overproduced and low on raw-ness.  Needs more time to be appreciated, maybe. 7/10.<br /><br />14) Up With the Birds: More chilled music from Chris Martin on piano.  Channeling a little \\"Fool on the Hill\\"-style Paul McCartney vibe in 2011. Call me \\"undecided\\" on this track.  7.5/10.<br /><br />When you remove the three short \\"intro/interlude\\" instrumental tracks, the album does deserve the 8.5 out of 10 review. It is a must for Coldplay and melodic modern rock fans (see Snow Patrol), but a notch below 2008s Viva.vibe--quite a compliment.  Great beat and lyrics--this song has anthemic qualities and is another standout and memorable track. 9.5/10<br /><br />5) Up Against the World: Feels like old acoustic Coldplay.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this in conjunction with the beautiful widgets calendar. The stock calendar app on my tablet wouldn't allow me to schedule events without some sort of sync to google or other online calendar. I was hoping that this app would allow me to put a bunch of colorful sticky notes all over my home screen but I haven't figured out how to do that yet. When I have made a reminder note it conviently puts it on the notification bar (in color)and gives you options on how many times to remind you. It's a pretty cool app.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I really love this game, it really makes you use your brain. I'm completely addicted, and I'm still on the first level. I can't wait to see how much harder It gets.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm not a very religious person but thought this would be a good app just to have. I was surprised that this had a audible option. This makes it great for children and adults. The ablilty to hear a voice recite verses makes this invaluable. I can't believe this was a free app. No disappointments here. I can't speak on the accuracy of the verses but from what I've read and heard they seem to be correct.
0470913029|5.0|Just a few thoughts.  It's not \\"low carb\\".  It's low to no \\"bad carbs\\".  It's a very simple lifestyle.  It's also simply the best way for us to eat.  Fresh grass fed meats.  You can occasionally find these at Walmart.  Fresh wild caught seafood.  Walmart regularly carries wild caught seafood now.  Fresh Vegetables.  Fresh fruits on occasion.    Fresh nuts and berries on occasion.    No milk or dairy products.  Absolutely no grains.  Get 8-9.5 hours of quality sleep a night.  Done.  Health follows.  Do it for 30 days and I GUARANTEE your energy levels will spike through the roof and you'll feel better than you have for years.   In some ways eating Paleo is the hardest type of \\"diet\\" to follow because it requires you cook on a daily basis and hit the grocery store fairly often for fresh produce.  It's not a gimmick and it's certainly not easy.  But again, it IS the best way to eat.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I absolutely love this album and it is now one of my top favorites of all time.  Kelly Clarkson is truly one of my role models and I hope she continues to be the strong, independent soul she is now. I have not stopped listening to the album since I got it 5 days ago.  Miss Clarkson has proven that she doesn't need to be powerful or popular by showing off her goods or hide behind costumes and animal parts. It's a relief to see that there are still musicians with substance, character, and compassion that actually care about the music.
0316098337|5.0|I just finished this book and I found myself sad to end it.  Jack is a very engaging and endearing character.  I had a tough time reading it the first chapter, but after that I started to understand Jack's five year old lingo better and I couldn't put it down.  It is so very different from any book I have ever read before in that it is narrated by a child.  Very unique novel!  The complex relationship between Ma and Jack is so interesting and complex.  If you are looking for an interesting  and thought provoking book, this is it!
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Serenity - a gun-packin' cowboy space ride that never ever gets old. Joss? You messed up by not standing up for the series Firefly, the basis of Serenity. The only saving grace? I can watch the series over, over, and over, and over, and over again. You guys missed the proverbial boat by not advertising the series initially, and then not renewing it - remaking it - making MORE FIREFLY! Hmmm. Perhaps someone bright will start writing the series anew...hmmm. Makes a person conjure a mite, don't it?
0062101897|5.0|I'm a big fan of behind-the-scenes film books and own quite a few. When I heard a Harry Potter book was being published, I was ecstatic.  Trust me, this book doesn't skimp on the details. From rights acquisition to CG creatures and environments, this book has it all. Every character gets a page detailing their design and development process. I personally love these pages since you can see the character's full outfit and in many cases even sketches.  The films all get their own section, which really lets the author focus on them individually. Coupled with the extensive concept art and set photos, the book is full of treasures.  The binding is tight (good news in such a large tome) and the physical book itself is well made and beautiful. One of the early pages had some glue sticking to it, but it is no big deal. One qualm I have is that this book is made in China. We have the seven Harry Potter books printed in the US, why not this one?

B005QI4TP8|5.0|Check out Florence's B version of Lungs, great songs as well! Lungs was running on the moors. Ceremonials is the battle held there. Here is my uneducated, non-musical review but don't blow me off just yet. It's dark and gripping. I can't say I love every song, In fact, there are two I know I'll skip but the ones I like are so, so good, I can forgive the misses. The songs I do only merely \\"like\\" I would love were it not for the songs on here that are so fantastic. I kind of get a Peter Gabriel/Annie Lennox vibe (and ain't that cool??) on this CD. So, here's what I think of some them indvidually which is something I don't usually do, break it down by song. Must be a Florence thing.<br /><br />#1 Only If For a Night - intense<br />#2 Shake It Out - might be the best song on the album, what a song<br />#3 What the Water Gave Me - pruny fingers, ha, seriously, awesome running on the moors song<br />#4 Never Let Me Go - beautiful<br />#7 No Light, No Light - again, one of the best on the disc<br />#8 Seven Devils - in my mind, I will always think of this as the Snow White song even though it isn't about Snow, love it<br />#9 Heartlines - I really like this song except for the chorus. It seems a bit flat to me, not as melodious. Must need to get my ears checked.<br />#10 Spectrum - awesome<br />#12 Leave My Body - dark and beautiful<br />#13 Remain Nameless - kind of slithers into your psyche and I like it! sick puppy that I am<br />#14 Strangeness and Charm - hmm, okay I love this song except for the little hiccup effect she has late in the tune -- feeling only love, feeling only love...haha, I've got that lyric wrong but I still think it works.<br />#15 Bedroom Hymns - This song is freakingly awesome and one of the best on the album. Why isn't this on the regular CD so everyone can enjoy it?<br />#16 Water demo - nice alternative version of What the Water Gave Me<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

B004RFYEEC|5.0|Even though 'SMiLE' was never completed, upon hearing these wonderfully beautiful, unique and inspiring tracks, you can definitely get a sense that Brian Wilson was on to something more then just amazing 44 years ago. With a tentative release date just two months before 'Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' back in 1967, one wonders what could've - or would've - been if the Beach Boys had followed through and gotten it out there as intended... would 'Sgt Pepper's' still be heralded as the greatest album of all time ?? Hard to judge that one. I personally don't think so though after hearing 'SMiLE'. There are die-hard Beatles fans that would dispute that claim but upon listening to even these unfinished tracks from the Boys, they would be hard pressed not to be impressed with what the band was trying to achieve - or should we get more specific and say Brian himself. Remember, 'Sgt Pepper's' was the creation of the Beatles PLUS George Martin where as 'SMiLE' was the envisionment of Brian Wilson alone.  One of the most powerful songs on this release is the beautiful 'Surf's Up'. Far removed from their previous songs of fun, sun and surfing, the brilliance of this composition alone is worth buying the collection (or purchasing the MP3s). One of the biggest things that separates 'SMiLE' from any other Beach Boys recording is the addition of Van Dyke Parks as lyricist on the bulk of the material. Starting with the beautiful collaboration between Brian and Tony Asher on the Beach Boys' 1966 release 'Pet Sounds', Van Dyke's involvement was a natural progression for Brian in his growing skills as a producer and wanting to expand outside of the Beach Boys usual formula for songwriting. Van Dyke's words throughout 'SMiLE' as a whole, brought a depth to Brian's compositions that anyone would be hard pressed to match. Upon listening to 'Heroes and Villains', 'Wonderful', and 'Cabinessence', one can tell that these aren't your usual Beach Boys songs. The music is astonishing asalways but lyrically, it is on another plane. To get a fuller understanding of what 'SMiLE' could've been like if it was completed, check out 'Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE'. Released and recorded in 2004 (with the assistance of his incredibly talented touring band), Brian decided to re-visit and completely re-create this masterpiece using these original Beach Boy tracks as a guide. It in itself is an astounding piece of work, but upon hearing these original versions of those songs (however incomplete in comparison to 'BWPS'), it really makes you smile (literally) to hear the true Beach Boys - Brian, Carl, Dennis, Al, Mike, and Bruce - and with their beautiful blending of vocals and stunning harmonies... there really has been nothing like them before or since. And more so, you really realize how so far ahead Brian was musically in the recording industry back then and why the term 'genius' was - and still is - very fitting for him. Even now, it may have come 44 years later then originally intended, but as you listen to 'SMiLE', it's still ahead of its time.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|Steve Jobs was nothing if not amazing. He gave the word beauty and functionality in everything he did. This book is a suitable tribute to his memory.  I especially found the part about Google and the Android platform fascinating, and Jobs's reaction to Google's misconduct was surprising. It was like seeing the old Jobs again.   If you don't know much about Jobs, I would say you should get this book and find out!
1400079144|5.0|Many readers may know of the author Dan Brown because of his famous books and movies, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\". Many  may also remember his famous character Robert Langdon who is a Harvard professor who teaches all about ancient symbols that can be found throughout history and around the world.  In \\"The Lost Symbol\\" we once again take an adventure with Robert Langdon as he is taken to Washington D.C. and learns that his friend Peter Solomon has been taken by a dangerous man who believes Robert can help him find a way into the Ancient Mysteries which have been told to hold secrets that can enlighten and change the world. Robert embarks on a journey and a race against time with Peter's sister, Katherine, who is a scientist discovering new forms of science that will change the way people may think. This book, just like all other Dan Brown books, leads its readers on a journey which may makes them question what they think they know and to open up their mind to new ways of thinking and new possibilities. It has a face pace, is adventurous, and will definitely keep readers guessing and on the edge of their seat until the very last page. Dan Brown fans will find thrill in this novel like in his other novels and once again will be able to relate to and bond with Robert Langdon as he races against the clock to discover the truth and save his love ones.

1439102732|5.0|In Sing You Home, Zoe Baxter wants more than anything to have a baby with her husband Max. They try and try and when she finally gets pregnant, her pregnancy ends at twenty-eight weeks and she and Max face the horrible tragedy of a stillbirth. After that tragedy, Zoe still wants to try again but Max does  not want to be put through the whole process all over again and decides to end their marriage. While struggling to cope with the loss of her baby and her husband, Zoe Baxter finds herself spending time with a school counselor, Vanessa. Zoe and Vanessa's relationship deepens and they fall in love. They get married in Massachusetts and then Zoe wants to try to have a baby with Vanessa using the last frozen embryo that her and her ex-husband Max have left. However, Max has turned to drinking and eventually finds help and guidance from a pastor who is against gay rights. Giving the embryo to his ex-wife Zoe and her new partner Vanessa goes against all the new beliefs Max has found and they fight for custody over the embryo while all dealing with the issues that are faced by people in the gay community.     All of Jodi Picoult's books have a controversy of sorts and the reader is able to see the opinions and points of view of all the characters about this controversy. In a world that is now dealing with the issue of gay marriage and gay rights more than ever, Jodi Picoult is able to bring to life the issues that many people in the gay community face. The book is real and compelling and leaves its readers questioning their own views on the topic. As always, the book leaves its readers riveted until the very end and feeling like they can really relate to the characters and their personal struggles. A highly recommended read for any Jodi Picoult fan or someone facing controversy in their own life.
B005WFUZTE|5.0|I am not gonna write a long Blah Blah Blah 10,000 word  review. All I have to say is that this album is AWESOME, PERIOD! I have been a Megadeth fan for 26 years and I know Megadeth. The only questionable album they have ever made is Risk. Every other album is AWESOME!
B001P9EQH8|1.0|Amplifier was purchased to connect to my IPad & splitter, so my husband & I could watch movies together on long flights. The battery didn't last through one movie.  It works great but battery life is only a little over an hour.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|This spider has a very bad design.  The wheels are way to small and smooth to provide any friction for the spider to gain traction and move.  It wouldn't even crawl on my wood floor.  A very anemic performance.  Also, it has light-up eyes that immediately indicate it is just a toy.  Even if you cover the eyes with something, it creates a loud sound as it tries to propel itself which makes it obvious its not a real spider.  I returned it and bought the Animal Planet tarantula and was very pleased with its performance.  Large rubber wheels with no problem crawling and no give away eyes.  Also quieter and paid the same price.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Metallica has been my favorite band since I was in middle school. I love their music, and was excited to see they were going to do a side project. I wasn't familiar with Lou Reed all that much, but I heard The View one night on Octane. I thought it had to be an intro to the album or something...nope. It was, to say the least, beyond awful. The lyrics are atrocious. Just a bunch of random words being read by an old guy over Metallica playing. If you remove the vocals, this CD would jump to 3-4 stars probably. I could go on, but there's nothing else to see that's not already been said. This album is bad...really bad.
0316017930|4.0|Outliers is captivating from cover-to-cover, one of those books that is hard to put down until you've devoured it completely.  Gladwell has a superb skill of storytelling, and often at the close of chapters, I can only say, \\"Wow.\\"  That being said, much of his evidence is circumstantial. It's often hard to disagree at first, but in these focused narratives, I'm often left wondering how much of the evidence was hand-picked.  Still, it's a thought-provoking book that is worthy of reading. Highly recommended!
0596009208|5.0|I have not finished it yet, but I can certainly say already: AWESOME BOOK! I had never read such an interesting and easy-to-understand book. It will probably cover all basics that I will need to start digging deeper on the Java developer certification stuff. Recommend it!
0525423273|5.0|Have you ever had a book that you just wanted to snuggle with? I mean, hug when you're feeling down, and know full-well that its hugging you back? That's what Anna and the French Kiss is like. It's sweet, it's romantic, and I officially have a huge crush on it. I mean, gobbled it down in a day and a half and literally swooned through parts of it.  Right before her senior year of high school, Anna is uprooted by her parents and forced to attend a boarding school in Paris. She's unhappily leaving behind her family, friends, and hugh crush that she sort of had a thing with. Scared of not knowing the land (or the language), she freaks out until she makes friends with Meredith, her soccer-loving neighbor; Josh, the artist; Rashmi, Josh's super smart girlfriend; and beautiful St. Claire, who Anna (and the rest of the school) swoons over upon first glance. St. Claire,with his British accent, takes Anna out to see the city and story evolves from there. But Anna still has Toph in the background, and St. Claire has a girlfriend at another school. As Anna becomes more comfortable with her new city, she becomes more comfortable with herself. And, through ups and downs, she learns the true meaning of \\"home.\\"  The story is simple, but so fun. It's classic boy meets girl, boy and girl can't get together so they develop a strong friendship, boy and girl hint at more...and so on. It has all the makings of a great coming of age romance, including tentative touches, awkward glances, love poetry, and epic multiple-hour long phone calls. By the end, I, too, was swooning over St. Claire.  These books could be similar, of course, but Anna stands out not only for its mushy cuteness, but for its strong writing. The story is more than just a girl meets boy story. Anna grows as a character throughout the book in the most subtle ways. You dont' even notice her development until it's pointed out. She's an interesting main character and realistic in many ways. (to the point that I wanted to slapsense into her her at times, but hey, teenagers.) Her friends are vividly described to the point that I wish they got their own books. Meredith was a great friend (and, in a way, mirror character to Anna), and I wish Rasmi got more screen time. She was complex and hidden. And St. Claire, well, he's more than just good looking of course. He's smart and sweet and had an obsession with world history.  What I liked most, however, was how real so many scenes felt. While I never went to boarding school, I did move away for college, so I can relate to that \\"i'm alone in a new place\\" feeling. That first day in the cafeteria. The overwhelming amount of love you have toward the first person to ask if you're okay. The excitement of that first crush. And the shocking realization when you realize that home may not be where you grew up anymore. I loved those scenes most, the ones when she's home and she realizes how she's changed.  And the flirtation. Oh was it adorable and blushy and fun.  I loved this novel. It's a great book to curl up with, and fall into. It makes me think of macaroons, cotton candy and love - all things sweet, and all things people crave for.
1451648537|5.0|I would simply like to join with the other reviewers who have given this the highest accolade. Jobs was a tremendous innovator. The book tells you what he did and how. His interactions with people such as Thomas Friedland, the mining promoter, are particularly interesting, as is the account of Jobs's reaction to the Xerox PARC invention of the GUI, and how he drove his own people to improve on PARC.  Jobs had imperfections, and this book has imperfections as well. Jobs is dead. Walter Isaacson's imperfections are overshadowed by his great accomplishments in writing the book. One might almost say that Isaacson prepared for this book with his biographies of Ben Franklin [[ASIN:074325807X Benjamin Franklin: An American Life]] and Albert Einstein [[ASIN:0743264746 Einstein: His Life and Universe]].
B0034G4P80|4.0|The first Iron Man movie set the bar so high. It's difficult to view another Marvel character movie without comparing it.  I think I'm going to place Thor just above The Incredible Hulk in terms of enjoyment. From top to bottom (so far) they rank: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Incredible Hulk. (I don't count the X-Men movies or Spider-Man as they were made by Fox & Sony)  Thor stars Chris Helmsworth (Captain Kirk's father from Star Trek) as the arrogant god who is exiled to earth where he is supposed to learn some humility. On our planet he meets Jane (Natalie Portman) and supposedly falls in love.  The biggest drawback for me was the humor. There were funny moments that just felt forced. The first time Thor gets tased is chuckle-worthy; when he gets a shot in his butt in order to control him, I start to cringe. When they recreate the fact that Jane hit him with her car, I rolled my eyes.  What I absolutely loved about this movie was the \\"villain\\". I'm still not sure you could call Thor's brother, Loki, the villain. He is such a complex character in this film. There are plenty of twists and surprises from him as this movie progresses. I thought he was the best part.  Once the movie was over, including the anti-climactic scene after the credits, I felt like I had just watched a placeholder for The Avengers movie. I realize Captain America is advertised with that theme, but Thor just didn't pack the punch I was hoping for.  I'd give this movie a B-. Loki was superb. Like The Dark Knight, I was hoping to see more scenes with the villain.

0439023521|5.0|This series will be another \\"Twilight\\" for young adults and teens. Can't wait for the movie. I could not find the paperback in stores and this book came very quickly. Thanks.
0553582038|1.0|I thought the first two books in the series were amazing. The third dragged on at times, but overall was also very good. This book however, was very frustrating to read. I'm not a big fan of how he tells the story from so many points of view to begin with, but I really didn't care about the new characters or what happens to them in this book. I do feel like the story is dragging out, just to sell more books. The new characters had potential, but nothing really happens the entire book. I'm all about cliff hangers, but this was ridiculous. The third book ended with some surprises, but you don't hear about them in this book. Now this book ended with cliff hangers, that seem to keep dragging on. There was way too much repetition in the story. I think Arya has gotten in the same situation 10 times and  managed to get out only to get back in the same place. The potentially awesome parts seemed to have been left out. Zombie Catelyn Stark sounds awesome, but there's only like one page about her. Ser Loras attacking Dragonstone would have been awesome too, but you heard about it after the fact, third hand. The main thing is that I hate feeling like I have to continue on with the series. I think I'm taking a break from this one for a while.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Longtime WW2 history buff here. Several of the characters featured in this series were also in Ken Burns' documentary (The War). This series follows a marine unit through the pacific island hopping of WW2. The series gives an intense, gritty and pretty accurate sense of the carnage of these battles with a good emphasis on the emotional and psychological impact these men experienced.  The series followed several of the characters home at the end of the war. I thought this was a great element of the story in that it helped to convey the difficulty that many of these soldiers experienced on returning home (can there ever be such a thing as \\"returning to normal\\" after experiencing such events).  All in all, an excellent series, well produced and directed, that gives a very good sense of what the reality must have been.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|finally installed the update and now my free song of the day is gone? what gives? I love discovering new artists thru that and now it's gone. what a load of bs.  otherwise it's a good app for dowloading amd storing all my music.
0553801473|4.0|Ok, I read it. I discovered these books only this year after the HBO series premiered. I devoured the first two in days, and have read all of the many many thousands of pages since spring. But really, even for me, unintimidated by length and lover of complexity, this has to stop. Someone needed to tell Mr. Martin 3 or 4 books ago that editing can be a gift to the writer. I did not buy this volume, having decided that I've spent enough on the series, with no end in sight. (Libraries, a gift to the exasperated.) Still well written, still full of dark complexity, but I really want him to get to the end. I find the characters interesting (less so with repetition) and I find the politics interesting (less so with repetition), and I find the world dark and compelling (less so with repetition). Oh, have I mentioned the repetition? One other flaw- with the exception of Tyrion Lannister, and a short time in Book 1 in the Stark family castle, this is the most relentlessly dark and unhappy group of people ever to grace literature.  There is (always excepting Tyrion) ZERO humor. A dose of Prozac before embarking on a tour of Westeros would be a wise move. Nevertheless, I will certainly read (though not buy) the finale, if there is a finale.Talent and vision are best yoked to discipline, and Martin's lack of discipline in editing himself has made the series suffer. I started this in the spring, and now Winter is indeed coming, and I have almost lost my patience.
B0000D8HDF|5.0|To my fortune I decided to buy Beethoven-Liszt 9 symphonies transcriptions under the superb interpretation of the virtuoso Cyprien Katsaris.  This proof to be a multiple-joy expierence.  After years of hearing many orchestral versions of Beethoven symphonies, hearing the piano transcriptions allowed me to rediscover the original joy that I experimented in my first contact with them, many years ago. I also was pleased with the discovery of such a tremendous artist as Katsaris, who has devoted many years to prepare this monumental task and was able, in extension, to \\"improve\\" some passages of the orginal score, overcoming with absolute masterly the amplified difficulties implied in this choice. And last, it was a significant coincidence that I could witness Franz Liszt's immesurable talent, craftmanship, generosity and devotion to Beethoven's music in countless hours of hard work.  An unbeatable talent-trinity: Beethoven-LIszt-Katsaris. Need something more?
B0058VA2U4|5.0|just get it already!!!!! Excellent comeback album. Like most reviews here it does sound like the album had Bush in mind when written but Belladonna belts it out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved reading this book so much when I first purchased it that I read it a second time. I've read this book twice in a matter of five days. I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters and the storyline that played out among them. I absolutely loved the relationship between Travis and Abby. How a man can completely change his life around for the woman he loves is amazing in my eyes. I'm tempted to read this book a third time already. It was a very well-written book. There are a couple of typos here and there, but you can overlook them after engrossing yourself into the story. I really hope that the author continues writing about Travis and Abby in subsequent books. I love their relationship and would like to see how it blossoms in the future. :)
B005J29HCQ|4.0|To review the music itself; of course it is amazing.  However, if you heard any of the billion previously released bootlegs of this material, there won't be anything \\"new\\" other than a few small moments.  I had a feeling this would be the case, yet a bought it anyways.  And if fact, if you're reading, you will probably buy it anyways.  Annoying, yes?  Just in case you DIDN'T know, the album is presented in Mono.  In the linear notes, they make a statement about how this release was made possible through technological advances in sound restoration/editing.  Why in heavens name Brian Wilson and company are so heck bent on releasing this is Mono is beyond me.  Other than my sneaking suspicion that 5 years from now there will be a \\"special stereo mix\\" of this material and fans will be forced to shell out some money again.  If they were gonna make people wait 44 years to release this stuff, the least they can do is get with the times and release it in Stereo.  It's sad when i hear fan boot leg mixes with better sounding versions of \\"heroes and villains\\" and \\"good vibrations\\" (perhaps not in sheer fidelity, but just in the simple fact that they provide additional clarity by the virtue of being stereo mixes).  I do have to say that of all the versions of \\"Surf's Up\\" i've heard floating around; it has never sounded better than it does on this release.  \\"Vega-tables\\" is another song that benefits extremely well from this release.  But, like the title states, if you happen to be reading this and you are only familiar with the \\"popular\\" beach boys.  By all means, buy this and listen to it.  And then buy Pet Sounds and listen to it.  And then go forth and buy every single 2 for 1 album that was re-released and listen to it.  Because as fans already know, the Beach Boys are the most under appreciated band in pop rock history and have tragically failed to receive the critical claim that others have been given (cough, the Beatles, cough).  This was supposed to be the band's magnumopus (and it probably IS their magnum opus) and it is being released today.....44 years later.  This is why all the 'hardcore' fans are so giddy today (smile!).  EDIT: i have to say, after listening to this 3 times through now (just listening, not in the car, or at work, etc) and running comparisons to some of the better bootlegs i have, the sound quality here, despite being in mono, is actually very good.  Do i wish they'd just mix it in stereo? yes.  but the biggest impact this release makes is those \\"smaller\\" moments on SMILE.  Wind Chimes, Mrs O Leary's Cow (or Fire as it's called here), sound really awesome.  The 'bigger' material, i do have to say doesn't sound as special, probably because those got the most attention from fan mixes; but as a whole, this is definitely worth the price and is a must buy (like i said in the beginning of the review, if you have any interest in this, you are probably buying regardless of what any reviewer says).
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This is a wonderful CD~  Scotty's voice runs over you like velvet!  Pre-ordering from Amazon was an easy experience and the price guarantee was great!
030788743X|4.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! Great concept, excellent writing, interesting characters, and a terrific story....this book has it all...it totally drew me in and I was not bored or disappointed for one second. If you are a geek, or a gamer, you absolutely MUST read this, and if you were a youngster in the 80's, well then, you are in for a big treat. I'd actually rate it 4.5 stars.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|I heard the song \\"Human\\" and couldn't get enough of it. So, I researched this band and decided to get this DVD to experience a live concert. The quality is unsurpassed, in picture and sound. I thought the days of the real band died with Britney Spears and the pop - manufactured music of today. I'm so glad I was wrong. The Killers are amazing musicians and showmen. Wow. By the time the concert was over, I was exhausted. It was an experience, even just from my tv screen. Highly recommended.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Let me go into the effusive extolments right off the bat. This is the best album I've heard in a good long while. Florence's voice brings to mind the image of some sort of modern pop banshee -- her vocals soaring and searing and overflowing with ethereal soul. \\"Ceremonials\\" is one of the more cohesive collections of songs you'll find these days, and almost all of them are good or better. While there isn't any one track that can top \\"Cosmic Love,\\" perhaps the best song she's written in her short career, it's an otherwise stellar album filled with a bevy of excellent (and often amazing) tracks. Florence + The Machine's sophomore effort, much to my surprise, exceeds their original album in almost every way imaginable. If there's only one album you buy this year, you need look no further.
B000FC2O48|4.0|The main source of excitement in Phil's novels, is a constant disorientation, and our minds' attempt to make sense of what we are experiencing. Within that mindframe possibilities flow out in many directions from even a subtle event. It is what one experiences while on LSD. In my opinion - Stigmata, Scanner Darkly and Ubik are particluarly good at this. I think \\"Maze of Death\\" is his most impactful work: to wander so aimlessly and darkly through the entire novel- until the final chapter when your breath is taken away- is catharctic and religious indeed.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|If this box set proves anything, it is that Mike Love had a very valid point to be concerned when he and the rest of the Beach Boys first heard the tapes for SMiLE in 1966. The great quality of the music is of no question, however the accessibility of the music is what separates SMiLE from anything released in 1966/67. It is silly to even try to compare it to Sgt. Pepper's or any Bay Area acts because they're not even in the same league. In fact, with SMiLE it is a totally different ballgame with different rules. It is undoubtedly hard for the average person to listen to SMiLE and get it the first time around. Like classical music, the album requires concentrated listening (and it never hurts to have some knowledge about the material before listening in order to understand the many themes of SMiLE). It may seem extreme to ask the listener to do extensive research before listening, but for those who do some outside reading, the experience is so rewarding. Every track, session, and outtake is either insightful, hilarious, gorgeous, or awe-inspiring. We have no idea if this is how the album would have \\"truly\\" sounded in 1967, but this is a fantastic approximation nonetheless and definitely worth your money. If the mood of SMiLE's music reveals anything, it is that it's awfully lonely being so talented and out there. Thankfully, we live in a time where there are just enough audiophiles and completists to demand this amazing material be heard.
0803726570|5.0|My 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves this book and I have to admit my husband and I do too.<br /><br />We are big fans of Julia Donaldson's books so this was another hit with our family.<br /><br />The pictures are really cute and cleaver and the story/text is very easy to read. This book and her other books read very quickly so they are an easy read before bedtime (especially if your child keeps asking for 1 more book before he/she falls asleep!!). The text flows so easily.<br /><br />If you can't find this book in the local bookstore, try around Halloween in the big box stores (or order from here!).
0061122416|5.0|Purchased this after seeing an interview of actor Will Smith where he mentions that The Alchemist literally+positively changed his life and backs his disciplined daily living that in turn fuels his successes ..<br />.. the audio book version was entertaining .. the narrator reads it like a bedtime story with just the right moderation in tonality.  The book uses science-fiction to illustrate \\"truths\\" about the power of the human mind+heart to accomplish what one desires .. the character used is a young boy and I would highly encourage buying the audio book so your kids can also engage in the listening and yes it is well suited for ages 8+(family learning).. Some key themes it offers to contemplate on -<br />** As a child you had many dreams to become and do things.  Growing up into an adult somehow your dreams were crushed during the process by some invisible force as it seems.. consequently the force appears to be negative/malevolent but in fact is driving you closer to your goals and preparing your spirit and will.<br />** When you really want something it is because that desire originated in the soul of the universe .. It is your mission!<br />** The soul of the universe is nourished by people's happiness and grief, positivity and negativity ..<br />** When you want something with all your heart, the entire universe conspires to achieve your dream.<br />All in all this book highlights programming of our subconscious mind that shape success/failure, and living in faith+alignment with the benevolent force, that while continually acting upon us whether we like it or not, know it or not, .. responds/reflects in a profound way to faith+alignment+effort :-)

0817439390|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book. I've been trying to understand what ISO and shutter speed and aperture all REALLY meant until I purchased this book. I am able to shoot now in 100% manual mode and know when to change each setting to suit my need. My photos turn out the way I want them vs. the way my camera thinks I want them now. This is a must-have for any hobbyist photographer looking to use their SLR to its fullest potential!

0525423281|5.0|After reading \\"Anna and the French kiss\\" and, thank goodness, having Lola in my bookshelf already I HAD to read it next. And I did in just one day like I did with Anna because you know what? It was awesome too!  So, what do you want to know about it? Let's start with a description of Lola, because beside being the main character she is the type of person I just love. First of all her parents are gay. Yep, two guys raising a little girl. Ans ince I'm all pro-gay here (some of my best friends are gay) I couldn't help but smile at this. I do believe they can raise kids like straight parents can and to read a book with that point of view was, beside refreshing, very brave. For that, I just want to say, you rock, Stephanie Perkins!  So yeah, going back to Lola: she is unique, just the way a girl should be. Her outfits are different every single day, and I'm not talking about clothes only but about wigs, different types and colors of wigs. Colors and clothes are the way she expresses herself. I'm a fan of that kind of people, you need to have a lot of confidence to go out there and be \\"different\\". Kudos for that!  But despite the loving parents not everything is shinning in her life... her real mother is actually the sister of one of her dads and she had a really difficult time with alcohol and other stuff.  And to complicate things more her \\"secret crush\\" (who wasn't secret at all...) ditched her after what seem to be a perfect friendship.  Only that Cricket had a reason, not a really good one, but he had a reason. You see, Calliope, Cricket's twin, showed a perfect talent for figure-skating and her whole family decided that, with that amazing gift, they all had to move according to her needs which meant: a lot of travelling and home-school for both kids. The last time Lola saw Cricket she thought they were in love but he proved her wrong and now that he is back he wants to continue where they left it but Lola can't do it, not only because she is still hurt for what he did but because she now has a boyfriend that happens to be a few years older than her.  And, if you read \\"Anna and the French kiss\\" and want to know what happened with Étienne and Anna then, read this book ;) I love it when a book have a crossover from another one, feels like meeting with old friends.  Are you a fan of YA romance or you read \\"Anna and the French kiss\\"? Then this book is a must, a huge, huge must.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I will pass on this and just download from iTunes.  Ultra violet does not work with all my stuff.  I tried Horrible Bosses, but gave up.  Movie was not great, but good enough to purchase.
0446585025|5.0|I thought the book was hilarious.  I have read all of Ellen's books and I think this was my favorite one.  She offers insight into her life without sounding autobiographical, which not many authors can accomplish effectively.  I had the entire book read over a weekend.  Overall, it was fantastic.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|I bought a Samsung  Blu-Ray BD-D6700 and this Avatar BluRay set the same day (Oct 2011). I updated the firmware on my new player the day i got it (most recent firmware is July 2011). Pop in the Avatar disc 1 and no dice. Turns out after research this DRM movie from Fox WILL NOT WORK ON A BRAND NEW BluRay player. Am returning this $40 waste of time as soon as possible. And if Amazon fights me because the package is opened I will quote their own website to them [...] which shows their troubleshooting tips for DVD/BluRay and they recommend returning the disc if it won't play on two players (which obviously means you've opened it).<br /><br />Amazon/Fox - if your product obviously doesn't work on even a brand new, up to date player intended to play BluRay discs....put that disclaimer on the product description! That way I look at a different version (DVD) and don't waste my time and yours returning a BluRay disc that doesn't work in a BluRay player (still ridiculous to write that sentence). I'm a heavy heavy purchaser from Amazon and this is the first time I've been disappointed and needed to return something.<br /><br />Who knew I'd have to read reviews on BluRay discs to make sure they'll work in a BluRay player...this is ridiculous. Partially considering returning the player as well if this is going to be a recurring problem with BluRay!
0393330435|5.0|I read this book from a somewhat different perspective (although it is shared by millions).  I wound up in Sunnyvale in 1978, in the heart of the Silicon Valley at the beginning of the Personal Computer Revolution. I hung out at Computerland of Los Altos and played with the early Cromemcos etc.  It was an extremely exciting time and, in retrospect, I was extremely lucky to have lived through it all.<br /><br />In those days, Jobs and Wozniak were household names.  Everyone was amazed at what they had done.  I took an early Apple II running UCSD Pascal into work at Control Data (fast dinosaurs), and the editor impressed people so much that CDC introduced its own \\"full-screen editor\\" very quickly.  When I was assigned to explain the internal workings of our Sort / Merge product, it was extremely easy to look up the relevant algorithms in Knuth and translate them to Pascal --- and print out traces which enabled everyone to grasp the inner details of a tournament sort.  It is no exaggeration to say that an Apple II was, in many respects, quicker and easier to use than a CDC computer which cost millions of dollars.<br /><br />Clearly, the world of computing was in for a total tranformation.<br /><br />Steve Wozniak's book explains just how he did it.  I was surprised to learn that his IQ measured over 200, and then I sort of kicked myself: \\"Well, what did you expect?\\"  This is the man who designed the Apple I singlehandedly, and then surpassed himself by designing the completely different Apple II a few months later.  He had the vision of a computer with a keyboard and a screen --- very new concepts when the hobbyist world was still dealing with punched cards and \\"blinken lights.\\"  Wozniak, acting alone, defined the new world of the personal computer simply by inventing it.  He was a true American genius who is simply stating the truth about his amazing accomplishments --- including writing the original Integer Basic interpreter for the Apple machines.<br /><br />A lot of people may wonder what Woz has to say about Steve Jobs, and I will report that Woz admired Jobs terrifically, especially when Jobs played the comeback kid and returned to an Apple that seemed to be losing direction.<br /><br />There may be an underlying story in this book, which Woz does not clearly bring out, and it has to do with what may have been a classic case of burnout.  This occurred after his stunning successes, and after he was worth $100 million, when he went to Hawaii and simply stopped working on engineering.  He decided that there were plenty of engineers in the world, but his kids had just the one father, and he decided to devote much more time to his family.  In fact, he became a teacher and really devoted the rest of his life to educating the next generation.<br /><br />In fact, leaving aside his very short life of crime (selling illegal Blue Boxes) this seems to be the tale of a model citizen, and someone you might have enjoyed knowing --- if you could follow his thoughts.<br /><br />A very enjoyable read, and a definite contribution to history.about Steve Jobs, and I will report that Woz admired Jobs terrifically, especially when Jobs played the comeback kid and returned to an Apple that seemed to be losing direction.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|This is the X-Men movie that should have been made in the first place. It doesn't exactly follow comic book continuity but that doesn't matter. It tells an excellent story in it's own right and the acting is phenomenal. Especially Michael Fassbender's version of a young Magneto. The visuals and special effects are flawless and the comedy is just enough to keep the comic book movie light without crossing over into campy. One definitely worth getting on blu-ray since the transfer is perfect.
1596432594|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough!  Other reviewers have nailed why it's an accessible intro to a genius.  A *likeable*, creative, humble, human, fallible genius.  Highly recced!

This album is like bad angel dust in audio form. The real words to describe this cd are not allowed in these reviews, all profanity and all bad. If you want to waste your money that bad, I could sell you a cd of farts and burps, that would even be better than Lulu.
142313866X|5.0|This is the fourth release in the Archive Series (after Story, Animation and Design). I would be remiss if I didn't say that it was the most breathtaking one; it is. Layout and Background provides that rare and unimpeded glimpse at the artwork that supports Disney animation.<br /><br />The concept behind the Archives Series started with the support of John Lasseter, who claims that his aspiration for the book was spending hours in the Animation Research Library gleaning from Disney's past animation's. He wanted to share this forgotten and sometimes never-before-seen art with the world. Although many famous artists have work featured, there are several pieces where the artist's name has been lost to time. This is a shame since the art is so beautiful.<br /><br />As the title articulates so succinctly, this volume is all about the layouts and backgrounds that are featured in the production and final animation of Disney shorts and features. The backgrounds are the static images under the characters, props and special effects. They are often works of art, by themselves. Obviously, with animation, you want to redraw as little as possible. With the inventive use of celluloid, artists could create sensational images that could be photographed over and over. The layouts are the technical drawings that lead to the backgrounds and tell the filmmakers what is going to be happening during the animation process and on the screen.<br /><br />Lacking the actual number, I would guess that the majority of pieces presented are finished backgrounds. Some times the layout piece stands alone and other times it is featured alongside the background. It is stunning to see how the step of adding color, texture and highlights make the difference in the finished background.<br /><br />This is a fairly expensive book but don't let that scare you away from purchasing a copy. It is coffee table size and a majority of the images are presented using most of the geography of the page. When warranted, the image spreads across both pages or is presented on a fold-out. You might balk at the price, but once you see the clarity and precision of the images, you will understand that the price is a steal.<br /><br />The coverage is fairly dense and offers art from a large number of shorts and animated features. The book is in chronological order and presents a short history of the Walt Disney Studios in imagery. Easily, there are less than 1000 words in this book. Beyond the introduction and the page about the Animation Research Library, the only words are the title for the final product and the year it was released. As can be expected, with artwork this sumptuous, there are no need for words.<br /><br />My only issue with reading the book was that I wanted to queue up each short and film to watch it again. But is that such a bad thought?<br /><br />If you are a fan of animation then this is a book that you have to own. I urge you to collect all of the books in the Archive Series, but this one stands out for so many reasons. After reading this title, I wish that Disney would sell high-quality reproductions of the artwork. The pieces featured in this volume are, simply put, stunning. I know that Disney animation as art has been done, but these are very specific pieces that can be contributed to artists and make fabulous hanging art.r is presented on a fold-out.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|In simplest terms, most addicting game EVER! You will not get tired of this game. Runs great, changes up enough to keep you interested, and is slightly challenging, sometimes to the point of sliiight frustration :)
0525423656|4.0|At the risk of unpopularity, I will admit that I was not a huge fan of Matched.  It was okay, but my expectations were Hunger Games high, and the book didn't meet them.  There was very little tension about the eventual choice that Cassia would make, and yet I really didn't understand her decision.<br /><br />That said, I thought Crossed was a far stronger novel.  In it, Cassia has determined to risk everything in order to find Ky.  The story is told in chapters alternating between their two viewpoints, and Crossed is far more action-packed and fast-paced than Matched was.  Cassia and Ky are both challenged in ways they have not been previously, and we learn more of who they are as they rise (or fail to rise) to these challenges.  Several of the characters from the first novel are off-stage in this one, but new characters are introduced.  Unlikely alliances are made.  Stakes are raised.  Cassia and Ky are growing up fast, and their relationship is both maturing and tested in this book.  And while this volume focuses primarily on Cassia and Ky, don't write off Xander.  He is still very much a part of the story.  I expect we'll see a lot more of him soon.<br /><br />I was somewhat ambivalent about continuing on to this second book, but I am now looking forward to the conclusion of this trilogy.  Condie has done a good job setting up the endgame.  With luck, the third will be the best yet.

1451648537|4.0|I'll admit I'm not finished reading it yet, but I'm slightly infuriated at the amount of grammatical errors and fragmented sentences.  I don't blame this on the author, rather, I'm upset with the publishing company for pushing forward with the production without properly editing and typesetting the book.  I assume they hoped to make a quick buck right after the death of Jobs and decided to speed up the process.  Every few pages or so, I stumble onto an incomplete sentence or something and just have to say \\"huh?\\" - it's annoying.  Overall impression of the book is good so far.  With a faceted character like Jobs, I'm sure things will be left out, it's hard to completely encompass the life of someone so iconic.  Overall though, I'm impressed and intrigued, I definitely recommend it.

B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci has long been a must read for me.  This book is him at his best.  The writing is crisp and you are hooked from page one.  John Puller is a Army CID - called into investigate a brutal family killing in rural West Virginia.  The father is a Defense Intelligence Agency high ranking colonel about to transition to civilian life.  Puller questions his solo assignment to the highly sensitive case.  He is also saddled with a father who is a living (though retired) Army legend and a brother serving life for treason.<br /><br />Along the way he partners with a local police detective - female detective Samantha Cole.<br /><br />Baldacci gives enough background to promote interest without bogging down the story.  And just as you think you have it ... the story takes a sharp left.  Concisely written police procedural wrapped around a compelling story.

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Been through this whole album a few times now. While it's not Megadeth's best album, it's definitely great music and stays true to what Megadeth is. That's all I want in a Megadeth album...none of the experimentation crap that other bands are trying and failing at. Dave Mustaine knows who he is, the type of music he should be making, and pulls it off very well here. As usual, he tells a solid story with the lyrics. This album is a no brainer. If you like Megadeth, buy it.

1401359418|3.0|Good Ideas, Poorly written.  The Book has some good Ideas and concepts. Is poorly written, to many examples of peoples experiences that don't really add to a \\"Scientific\\" Investigation.  If you think you have Bad Luck this book will give you hoppe.
0525423656|5.0|Crossed picks up right where Matched left off. Cassia has gone to find Ky, who has been sent to the Outer Provinces. What follows is an amazing journey that may not be as fast-paced or action-packed as some devourers of the dystopian genre may desire, but is instead a breath-taking exploration into characters, love, and freedom.<br /><br />Honestly, this book ruined me. After reading it in back in September I still have not been able to find a book that spoke to me as much as Crossed did.<br /><br />And, here's the thing, while I liked Matched, I didn't love it. For as good as Matched was, it really pales in comparison to its sequel. Which is so incredibly rare that it made this story all the more awe-inspiring and treasured to me.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, by the end of the book, the plot almost feels like we are back where we've started, except we've introduced some new characters, some of which are friends, and others are in that mysterious gray area. However, I personally felt like the characterization was so strong in this novel, that I didn't mind the slow pace of the plot. And when I mean that the plot has a slow pace, I am directly referring to other novels in the genre like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, and others that have a quick-moving cinematic plot. I think the plot pace was comparable to Matched, with Crossed being the faster-paced of the two.<br /><br />Each page of this novel is a work of art. With each turn of the page I found myself pointing to a passage and saying, \\"Yes! I've felt this way before! That's exactly what it's like.\\" And what is remarkable is that I don't live in a dystopian society where everything is chosen for me. Ally does a magnificent job of taking a society so different from our own, and relating it to the human experience that so many of us share.<br /><br />So, the take-away message is this. If you loved Matched, read Crossed. If you weren't enamored with Matched, read Crossed. If you haven't read Matched, then get on that, and read Crossed next.

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|For me the long awaited film `Captain America: The First Avenger' about one of my favorite childhood comic book superheroes turned out to be a somewhat bittersweet experience. I probably shouldn't have expected anything less since ones expectations always surpass what one ultimately receives. You see I wanted nothing less than total immersion into an imaginary world where good and evil are plainly marked, heroes and villains wear memorable garb and the action and adventure comes at you non-stop.  Now that I think of it, a little bit of naïve idealism, justified revenge and romance should be thrown in just to spice things up even more.<br /><br />From a technical point of view the film meets or excels all my expectations, I honestly can't find any fault with the final on-screen product. The visuals are superior, storyline solid, soundtrack memorable and the overall aura of a WWII America comingling with a surreal occult, Nazi universe is just short of miraculous. Yea, I guess I liked it. And what about the cast you ask? No problems here either. Who wouldn't love Chris Evans in the role of Captain America and immediately fall in love with Hayley Atwell in the role of the Captain's love interest Peggy Carter. Then of course there's the incredible Hugo Weaving in the role of Johann Schmidt (aka: Red Skull), Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (Iron Man's father). There's definitely loads of quality talent throughout.<br /><br />At this point you might be wondering why I described my initial viewing experience as \\"somewhat bittersweet\\" since I've had only positive things to say about the movie. The reason is that the film disappoints on one level which for me is the most important of all. I like to call it the repeatability factor. For me the most important quality in a film is its ability to instill within the viewer the unquenchable desire to watch it over and over again. It has to be able to `click' with the audience in such a way that always leaves one panting for yet another viewing. For me `Captain America: The First Avenger' just doesn't connect with me on that level. It does however cause me to look forward to the next screen appearance of the good Captain, maybe that was the filmmaker's prime intention all along.anting for yet another viewing.

B005LRWRZ8|2.0|Megadeth has been one of my favorite bands for years and years. I'm honestly not one of those people who hates anything that isn't a carbon copy of Rust in Peace. I enjoyed a bunch of songs from TSHF, I liked some of United Abominations, etc. But I just can't enjoy this album. There are a couple of great riffs on this album, but the lyrics are absolutely laughable and the guitar solos just seem like they were constructed largely out of Guitar World's \\"betcha can't play this\\" feature - breakneck speed shred with little regard for phrasing or melody. Mustaine has ALWAYS surrounded himself with guitar players who had great feel and phrasing - Friedman, Pitrelli, Poland, etc...but Broderick in my opinion is just the wrong choice for this band. For those quick to throw this idea out, sit here and hum the solo from Tornado of Souls. Now do that for any song on this album, or on the previous album (Endgame). They're just not memorable, they don't have any discernable melodies that stay with you. Is this album better than what 50% of bands are putting out nowadays? Definitely, because Megadeth are professionals and very good at what they do. But the quality of the music has been consistently degrading and I honestly couldn't get all the way through a single song on this album with the exception of Never Dead. The songs sound uninspired and formulaic. I kept listening hoping I'd hear a solo that would catch my ear, but every solo was basically the same mach speed alternate picking exercise. It's unfortunate but for me it seems that Megadeth have gone the way of Metallica.
B002JCSRKC|2.0|I have never had to return an item to Amazon and this was my first. I usually don't review, but these require a comment. They are very thin and light, so if you are wearing them to and from buildings to protect your feet from rain, they will be great. If you intend to use them to accomplish yard tasks during increment weather, move on. I have a large property and many animals. These were for rain days when I still have to go out and feed. They are not good for this purpose. They are so thin, I could see my feet getting frostbite before I can finish the tasks!
B0052VUNHC|1.0|To be fair, this book is about as good as Twilight, which is to say, not that great.The characters fall flat. There is almost no description of the heroine and we are led to believe that the hero is a real bad ass just because he rides a motorcycle and has lots of tattoos. Laughingly, the author neglects to tell us what the tattoos are of. Tattoos in general don't make a bad boy, I mean what if they are tattoos of Scooby Doo? Seriously, I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. Travis is pathetically transparent. I actually really love brooding anti-heroes, but Travis just comes off as a predictable whiny frat boy. There is almost no descriptive language and the  story seems to be composed entirely of an annoying teenage prattle of a dialogue.   I suppose if I were fifteen, this book would have impressed me. If you're really looking for an anti-hero brooding bad boy that will knock your socks off and soak your knickers try, The Silver Devil by Teresa Denys.
1613821395|5.0|No wonder Wilkie Collins' book is still in print after all these years. I read at least 100 books a year and this is one of the best I've ever read. I truly could not put it down. No TV until I finished reading it.<br /><br />Set in 19th century England, \\"Woman in White\\" is a mystery that is not cleared up until the final pages, with a surprising twist at the end. There is no detective and no murder, only a young man who has a personal interest in solving the mystery. The final chapters are as thrilling as any modern murder mystery.<br /><br />Collins set the scene in old England with much attention to detail. He describes clothing, food,furnishings, manners and customs of the period very vividly and visually. The old-fashioned dialog actually moves along pretty well, since every conversation furthers the plot. It's long book but you really can't (and won't want to) skip any pages.<br /><br />\\"Woman in White\\" was made into a movie (Swedish) in 1949 and has since been made into several TV movies and miniseries.
030788743X|5.0|OK, Ready Player One is aimed squarely at me.  Videogame-obsessed geek saves the world with his vast knowledge of 80s pop culture?  Bam!  I didn't quite read it all in one marathon session, but it was close.  It's thought-provoking, inspiring, and -- most of all -- enormous fun.  Highly recommended.  I wish I'd written this book.  Once upon a time, I wanted to be a writer.  It turned out all my best stories were about videogames, which possibly should have been a clue that game design was more my destiny. Anyway, next month is National Novel Writing Month, and it turns out my vague plan for that was completely pre-stolen by Ernie, except he did it way, way better than I woulda.  Jerk.  Plot summary: The designer of the world's greatest game dies, stipulating in his will that his fortune goes to the one who solves an epic treasure hunt he's left behind hidden in the game world. Our trailer-dwelling protagonist finds himself at the forefront of the hunt, and the stakes keep escalating.  Awesomeness.

B000LXH11C|5.0|Alan parsons project have always reminded me of a lighter less dark pink floyd. No suprise considering that alan parson worked on Dark side of the moon with the floyd. This is a superb collection of APP music spanning there entire career. APP usually had conceptualy based albums, rather it was over use of electronic surveliance (I Robot) or gambling addiction (Turn of a friendly card). They walked a fine line between pop and progressive rock to create a more radio friendly body of work than lets say a band like yes did. There is no shortage of great music to find on this generous double disk set. The brilliant vocal work of eric woolfsen on tracks like Eye in the sky the disco funk swagger of I wouldnt want to be like you and the early 80s radio anthems like Games people play leave listeners with a collection of songs to be treasured.

B005NPLXJ4|4.0|As a fan of both Metallica, Lou Reed, & The Velvet Underground, I find it baffling to see all these one star reviews. I'm not by any means saying this album should be praised as masterpiece with an abundance of 5 star reviews, but come on. The drums on this album sound great! Big fat drums. Just the way they should have sounded on Death Magnetic. Old Mr. Ulrich really steps his game up on this one. Lou Reed sounds fine. The people who say that he can't sing, well of course he can't! He never truly sung in his entire career, BUT, I will say he does sound like an angry old grandpa at times. Particularly in \\"Frustration\\", which starts up with a kind of creepy carnival/a clown is going to come out of the corner and murder you type atmosphere, he screams \\"I WANT YOU AS MY WIFE\\". I can't help but chuckle a bit, but the big riff in that one saves it for me.<br /><br />Brandenburg Gate starts out with a nice little acoustic intro, then Lou Reed hits you with a \\"I would cut my legs and tits off when I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski\\". A nice laid back song with some nice riffing in there.<br /><br />The View contains the now legendary, \\"I AM THE TABLE\\", from James Hetfield. His vocals are improving, and it shows on this track. A bit repetitive, but the last 1 minute and 30 seconds or so redeems this track for me. Too much crash cymbal though Lars, Jesus.<br /><br />Mistress Dread must have been the song they were talking about when they said there would be some stuff on here that sounded like Master of Puppets, and indeed it does. It sounds very reminiscent to Disposable Heroes, but faster and with Lou Reed on vocals.<br /><br />Iced Honey might just be my favorite from the album. It should have been released as the single as opposed to The View. It's a somewhat mellow rocker with a riff that will just stick in your head.<br /><br />Dragon is another one of the tracks with just a big, fat, heavy, mean riff. The intro is just too long. I mean about 2 and a half minutes long, but when it kicks in, phew. It's great.<br /><br />The closer, Junior Dad, is another one of the tracks I really enjoy. A very beautiful sounding song, reminiscent of The Unforgiven III which I feel could have been cut by about 8 minutes of orchestra as it's merely 8 minutes of orchestra , but hey, this is Lou Reed's album and he loves those long ass songs. The true new Metallica album is being written as we speak, according to Robert Trujillo, so don't you worry Metallica fans.<br /><br />In closing, although this album isn't perfect, I found it to be quite enjoyable. I urge you to actually listen to this album before buying into all these 1 star reviews as they're mostly from angry Metallica fans trashing on Lou Reed. I want the new album too guys but lighten up a bit. You might not enjoy it as much as I did, but if you like music in general, there's bound to be something here you'd enjoy.<br /><br />Top track picks<br />1. Iced Honey<br />2. Frustration<br />3.

0061997811|5.0|I was recently given this book for my birthday, and I have to say that it is stunning.  I made it half-way through the book in one evening when the lights were out thanks to a recent snowstorm.  I suppose there is no better way to read a book about Harry Potter than by candlelight, but, even if you don't have that excuse, this is a must-have!  The stories from the actors, designers, crew, producers and directors of the series are truly special and provide insight into these films that most people would never have access to.  There are wonderful photos of sets, original drawings, interviews and a few special extras for the true Harry Potter fan.  I would highly recommend this book to fans of all ages!

B004LROUNG|3.0|I guess it's not bad that the book is mostly predictable if the story itself is entertaining.  JG does a decent job in the first half of the book throwing up some building blocks.  Some are obvious fake-outs like the Pearl Harbor lady, and some peters out (employment lawsuit) although I can see that playing a larger role, and then one kind of sits in the background like a giant life preserver that you know will eventually come in and save everyone and give them their small modest slice of fairy tales...  I'm not going to critique the legal aspect of the story, since most readers are not in the legal profession, and will gladly trade a good story over any technical accuracy.  But the predictability really got old very quick.  You just know from the start, as soon as you are told that David Zinc is a good guy who loves his wife, that everything will work out for him.  And the old partners, as they stagger as they absorb hits, will come out okay in the end.  And the hard scrabble, head-strong African American help?  Oh, you know she's gonna make out juuuust fine.  There's something of a soapbox aspect of this book too, and I think that's not bad.  But it just seems like JG just reached into a grab bag of cliches and old plots and quickly churned this out.  Not that this was a bad read for me.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  And I know a good number of these characters in real life as well and I think they are very realistic, from the street lawyers unburdened by ethical considerations chasing ambulance to frosty, serious corporate types; and been-there, will-help-you judges to dictatorial federal court judges.  In the end, the reason why this book got a 3 stars instead of 4 was the way it ended.  The life preserver in the background dutifully drops in the pool, and all the floundering characters grab on and gently float to their little piece of fairy tales.  To do that, JG had to make the offending corporation  act like some kind of Santa Claus with a big heart and biggercheckbook.  And the referrals?  Well, if I'm a big corporation who want its competitors to get hit by mass tort, I doubt I'd pick David Zinc, who remains reasonable, affable, and kind to the end, to go after them.  Alisandro, that one I might pick.  So all in all, a flawed but still entertaining attempt.  It's still a solid buy because these books are meant to be consumed and discarded, and not make you think too much in the process.
