B00DHNB5CY|4.0|It was really good but I missed the humor from the original. I think it is definitely worth watching though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game you get to take care of a horse like it's real and in the future I want a horse so this is preparing me for one
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I am so glad to have this classic on DVD! The color and sound is great! I love this movie!

B007THA4FI|5.0|LOVED this book.  J. K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller/author..  Highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read....
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins never ceases to entertain and educate at the same time.  &#34;Eye of God&#34; is no exception.  He is by far my favorite author.
0395389496|5.0|Is there anyone who does not know this story? Is there any adult who has grown up and can no longer hear the bell? Sadly, yes, all too many of us learn to no longer hear the magic.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|OK, I'm a bit of a Johnny-come-lately to this movie, seeing it for the first time a few days ago. After all the hype back when it was released in theaters, I was prepared to be disappointed. But I have to say, it's one of the best superhero/comic-inspired films out in recent years. The first thing to know is that it's really helpful if you've already seen Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America beforehand, as all of those stories intertwine in The Avengers. Joss Whedon does a credible job trying to bring viewers up to speed, but by the nature of tying so many previously-established characters together and also getting the central plot of this film off the ground, folks who haven't already seen those other films may feel lost/confused/disconnected. OK, that said, let's talk plot: Whedon was smart and kept things simple. There's one highly visible villain (Loki), along with a shadowy menace playing the heavy in the background. They plot to enslave humanity and take over Earth ... yada yada. Who cares, right? If you're like me, you just want to see how Thor would fare in a fight against, say, Captain America. Or what kind of sarcastic quip Stark is going to throw at &#34;the Big Guy&#34; (Incredible Hulk). Well, you get all that, plus a lot of snappy dialogue (mostly for the highly gifted Robert Downey Jr.), fun and unexpected character twists, playfulness, and a lot of humor. The climactic moment between the Hulk and Loki, well, I won't give it away, but that alone is worth the price of admission (providing you haven't already read a spoiler about it). Suffice it to say, very funny and very satisfying. To sum up: The movie is a little cheesy in parts (hey, it's based on a comic book; what do you want?), but if you don't take yourself or your movies too seriously, you'll have a rockin' good time.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Addictive!!!  Love this show...glad I'm watching all the seasons at one time.  Love it!!!!  bring it back for season 5!
B0049J3QAY|5.0|Hubby & I just saw Monsters U in theaters and enjoyed coming home to see this a few days later.  The animation stands up as being detailed and well lit and it's just awesome to see how well the storyline ties together with the newly released prequel.  Awesome.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|As the author of the book [[ASIN:B00DA7QU86 Public Speaking A Simple How-to Guide on becoming a comfortable and confident public speaker]] I needed to know some information regarding how to communicate with people. This book has helped me in that way. Thanks.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This book helped me realize that success is not something that happens over night, but it is your daily habits that will dictate whether you will be successful or not.<br /><br />Darren covers a bunch of different areas to focus on, and it is impossible not to get better if you follow his system<br /><br />The bad thing is it is much easier not to do than to do it and change the bad habits.<br /><br />If you are sick and tired of where you are right now and you are not living the life you planned 5 years ago than you must read this book
B004SIP6QI|5.0|Great movie, love Nicole and other stars.  Love the scenery and going back in time.  Makes me appreciate what we have now.
140006922X|5.0|In my 8 years of Catholic education I didn't learn as much about Jesus as I did from this book.  Aslan is a true scholar, and I am judging this in light of my history degree and my Catholicism.  He brings the reader back when the classical world was in great flux, explains how and why Jesus had such an immense impact on that world.  I honestly could not put this book down.  I highly recommend it to everyone because the author tells a great story with understanding and style.<br /><br />This is going to be a modern classic.  St. Paul would love it, as Sr. Theresa would say.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Pretty good game, surprising twists and imagery. Wish the full game was free because it is kind of a bummer when you get involved in a gane only to be stopped by the great  page that says something like &quot;If you are enjoying this game, get the whole story for $x.xx. otherwise very cool
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Back when Dragonvale was only avalible on android devices, I was hoping that it would be on the kindle, and it has!<br />This is a really fun game and can also teach you to be patient.<br />I don't get why people are complaining about having to use gems and spenting money to get more, because the game is still really fun, even if you don't use gems. I've been playing for a while now and have at least twelve or so variaties of dragons, and not a single gem used or money!
B0073COMKW|4.0|Update: apparently location and the color of what this bulb (and probably any white light) has a big effect on what this looks like. Lacking a floor lamp and being that most of my rooms' ceiling wiring is burned out I got an adapter and plugged this directly into my wall, and so a lot of the light was against the wall and the brown carpet, it did not look like a morgue light but much more pleasant, you could say a very strong night light, enough to light up the room sufficiently for where it was and without being too annoying. I admit though I prefer using my recessed closet lights that barely light up anything to this led one as even now that it is no longer depressing I don't like being blasted with all that light at the side of my face. If get a floor lamp perhaps the shade and location will make it tolerable enough to use regularly. Part of the reason I may not use the bulb much is because I've plugged it into a remote controlled outlet, which though ironically is supposed to make it more convenient to turn on, hinders me from using it because the remote gets lost a lot and I don't want to bend over to manually turn it on.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Got it for a friend but she said it was a great book! She recommends it to anyone interested. Thanks
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I could do without the gore but other than that it's entertaining and definitely on the \\"fringe\\" of science. Worth a try.  UPDATE: The series gets better as you move through the seasons.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I can't imagine going through what these people went through. This is a story about courage, strength, and family when all odds are against them.
076115678X|4.0|I saw this book in a beauty parlor and couldn't put it down, so I ordered my own copy.  It has tons of tips for any type of hair.  It tells you how to keep your hair in good condition, how to let it be beautiful on it's own without all kinds of glop in it, and much much more.  I haven't finished it yet, but have learned a great deal.  I recommend it to everyone.
B006LSZECO|1.0|It was predictable.  After reading 3/4 of this novel, I quit reading.  I think it is the first book that I've ever started reading  and just said &#34;enough&#34; before the ending. The  author used too much foul language that I felt was not necessary to the story line.  I understand the use of such language is required to give the reader a better sense of a character's thoughts and feelings, but this was overdone.  Another thing about this book is that I kept sensing that the anger and hatred was from the author and not the character. I couldn't move away from that feeling.
B0036FYO12|3.0|I was born in the 70s, did I miss something?  When was it okay to kidnap a woman at gunpoint (assault with a deadly weapon?), do a home invasion into her apartment, tie her up in a vulnerable and uncomfortable position, leave in *her* car, threaten a different woman who is the wife of the friend you got killed, return, untie the first woman, sexually assault her (oh sure, Farah looks as if she's into it, but you try saying no to a guy who's held a gun to your face all freakin' day, minus when he tied you up and gagged you---plus he's Robert Redford in the 70s!  Who could say no?), expose your manly chest hair (assault with a deadly weapon?), pressure her into helping you kidnap a government official (isn't kidnapping a federal offence?  Isn't that for the Fibbies?), pressure the woman by hinting heavily that you want her to leave her incredibly patient boyfriend, threaten a government official at gunpoint at night in his own home, witness a murder and aid and abet the cover-up, again threaten a government official at gunpoint in broad daylight, and don't conclude the damn movie?  It's only the CIA guy's toupee and Max Von Sydow that save this movie.  And now I gotta go listen to some Tori Amos songs to get back to 2013.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|It is great to have a television show that suspends disbelief and to have a show that initiates conversations on possibilities.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is incredibly addicting! Once you start this strategy game, you won't be able to stop and you'll want to feed the cute little Om Nom.
0425263924|5.0|The crossfire series is fantastic.  Dominant, great looking man, beautiful woman that intrigues the man, and incredibly written sexiness.<br /><br />May leave you a little breathless.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great action, fun story that was well-acted. I watched it with my son and he enjoyed it also. The Marvel series is some of the best movies out these days....well done!
B0028MBKVG|1.0|Okay, sorry to all McDougall fans here, but I absolutely hated this book. I had to read it for a school assignment and I was actually looking forward to delving into a novel full of secrets about a \\"hidden tribe\\" (what teen wouldn't be?). Unfortunately, McDougall's horrible writing style, similar to that of a child, makes the book almost impossible to enjoy. His multiple attempts at jokes are all failures, the entire thing is filled with hyperboles, and quite frankly, I couldn't care less for his random side stories that take away from the main plot. The most interesting thing is that for a book with so many facts, he cites absolutely nothing. NOTHING! I've read high school papers with more citations than this best-seller, which doesn't even deserve to be a best-seller, considering how much he lies. Every time he pulls up a piece of info, look it up online. I'm sure you'll be surprised when you find half of the things he says aren't true. I find it surprising that the school system has made this book part of our curriculum, especially because he has no credible sources and exploits a tribe of people who are anything but super human. The Tarahumara experience just as many injuries as other runners, not to mention that these \\"peaceful\\" people have an incredibly high domestic abuse rate. Sure, it's a great read if you want motivation for running, so long as you're willing to overlook awful writing ridden with facts the author has pulled out of thin air.
B008NA2JMQ|1.0|Ripped people off. Made money. Made friends. Spent a lot. Injested  drugs. Had sex. Hit wife. Got arrested. The end.
0425263908|4.0|i am a huge fan of these types of books and this book has many sexy steamy sex scenes written well however towards the end the auther again starts to repeat actions ... its still a great story and i am starting the second book in the trilogy now to see what happens next.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. Always new challenges so you never get bored. I love the graphics and dressing my horse up! Def recommend!<br />Sooo fun!
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|The title is correct, the character's names are correct, but that is where it ends. I felt oddly embarrassed for the creators of this movie as I sat in the theater. This movie was simply a string of hokey one-liners and action shots. They made McCoy's character out to be some sort of angry idiot that can only speak one line at a time.<br /><br />I won't go into details of why this movie sucked so bad, but if you want to know, simply look at the rest of the negative views. Star Trek by name only, that is where it started and where it ended...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Don't use it very ofter, but love having it when I need it.  It is a very simple calculator. I love the large number keypad and print out.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I had no clue who or what John Carter was prior to seeing this movie, and now that I've seen the movie, I want more. All of it fascinating and I'm unsure why I never knew of John Carter growing up or in any other circles...not sure. It is a must see! In addition, download the app for the movie, the app itself follows/plays along with the movie, the app is a piece of artwork. You need to see it!
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I thought this was a really good movie.  Many plot twists right up to the ending seeing Tom Cruise to something different was refreshing.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It is super fun but if you don't have a facedook you can't pass some off the goals  but you can use the tile things to pass them but then you will get some more of those.

006224454X|3.0|Stories based on neurological pathologies from closed-head injuries can make for intriguing reading or viewing. The film \\"Memento\\" and the novel \\"The Echo Maker\\" come to mind. But, what's really most interesting in this book is not the plot or the characters, but how the author was able to pull this off. Think about it. It's written in the first person, but the protagonist-narrator, Christine, has no continuity of memory. She awakens each morning as a 40 something whose most recent memory is from her twenties or earlier. Yesterday, the day before, and all the days of 20+ years are not in her memory. How is the author to present a coherent narrative from this voice? Ms. Watson overcomes this hurdle with a journal that Christine uses to build paper memories and her doctor who telephones daily to tell her where it is hidden. I \\"read\\" the audio version of this book, and once I realized that much of the plot would be revealed as Christine either wrote or read journal entries, I feared that I might be lost without the formatting clues available in a text version. However, the author moves the story along so flawlessly that one is never in doubt as to which is happening.<br />Finally though, I take away 1 star for the level of suspension of disbelief required.<br />Recommend: Yes
B004XISI4A|5.0|Since I started reading 'Game of Thrones' Book 1 at Easter, I have been hooked and obsessed to the point it became hard not to bring some GOT reference into any conversation.  While this was not my favourite book in the series, it does get to a reasonably satisfying point where I can now wait for the sequel.  I have just started reading a historical novel set in around the crusades, with similar battles, but it so pedestrian compared to Martin's writing.  I am even comparing paragraph to paragraph and looking at the devices that Martin uses.  So apart from the epic story line, his writing is always compelling.  Why does it seem so? His unusual viewpoints, his tight action, his witty conversation lines, the way the action, paragraphs, and chapters don't start with longwinded explanations, his use of language, his varied and sometimes horrendous characters, all meant there were days I couldn't wait to get home from work to keep reading. Thoroughly recommend this book and series for a reading experience with impact.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I had never read the books before I saw this movie.  Seeing the film, I was highly motivated to quit procrastinating and read them.  I think the film was far, far, better than the box office would indicate, and deserved a lot more attention, and let's face it, love, from Disney.<br /><br />This was a great start to what should be a really awesome series.<br /><br />Please Disney, make the rest of the series!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is so well though out and quite capturing demos episode one. The story line contains humor, love, deception, triumph, and tragedy. Definitely one of the best shows on tv!!
0770437400|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, but the book is so much better.  Do yourself a favor and read this book if you are a zombie genre fan.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I downloaded this mainly as a way tho keep up with my favorite blogs. I love that it can open directly to the blog so leaving comments is a breeze. The search feature makes it easy to find your favorite blogs, although to be able to paste links in the search form would be great. It does have a few glitches. It freezes up and goes nutso sometimes. And shuts itself down for no reason.
1439177791|4.0|The author bears her soul in a moving, gripping manner.  This book is helpful for anyone who is interested in learning more about the inner workings of anorexia.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This watch is awesome!! It looks good and the quality is amazing!! I'm very pleased with it.<br />Some other watches I have purchased looked cheap, not this one! It is not too light but it is not too heavy either. Plus do not look huge on my wrist. Loved it!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Awsome album! Definitely the same caliber heavy grungy metal that Black Sabbath has always been known for. 13, 13, 13.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fabulous brain game!  Free preview is quite short, but I am very happy with the paid version of the game and will be purchasing more games by this developer.  Much more than just a hidden object game.
B001NA6096|4.0|Charming talky movie that made me all nostalgic for my youth and that one time, I did not have, falling for a French girl in Vienna.  Julie Delpy is mesmerizing.  Yes, we all said things like that once.  It is sweet to hear them again.  It is sweeter to realize that we never have to say them again, because by the end you just want to slap all young people for being so silly.  Addictive though- I ran right out and watched the next one in the series and I cannot wait to see &#34;Before Midnight&#34;.
1594481717|5.0|its making time to read it. I am left handed and can understand it very much I do recommend it
0062255657|5.0|I don't know what I was expecting when I opened this book.  I'd read all the non-spoilery reviews, so I really had no idea apart from what was on blurbs in different places.<br />I read it twice through the first day I got it.<br />So beautiful.  So sad.  So scary.  So Gaiman.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Okay so I'm 9 years old and I'm pretty far ahead . I got Fluttershy before I got Rairity and I got Apple Jack 10 to 20 tasks before I was supposed to.I kept having to do dumb tasks like them telling me to get Apple Bloom and I already got Apple Jack.P.S. don't get Sunset Shimmer she is a mean girl from a new my little movie.
B00821OX98|5.0|Absolutely the best science fiction series ever. Very well thought out. It is a must see for science fiction lovers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love it. I can't wait to see more.it's really challenging make me work hard in solving the rooms door open mechanisms thank you
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|Absolutely love the new album. It has songs for all moods. This is his best album yet and can't wait to see what else he will bring in the future. Everyone should definitely check it out.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This was a typical Nicholas sparks book...but one that kept me interested until the last page.  Quick and easy read.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Really thrilled with this book. I loved how the romance played out, how it fit with the story. I loved learning the mystery of Kaleb and how it all tied in with the other books. It makes me want to back and read all the other books so I can see how the bits and pieces in them built up to this book's story-line. The romance was awesome. It makes remember why I loved this series- originally the first book was my favorite but this one blew it out of the water.
140006922X|5.0|This is a profoundly facinating book about Jesus of Nazareth by a former evangelical Christian.  Aslan's research and knowledge is outstanding.  A must read for everyone!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I watched the movie before reading the book, mostly because I didn't want to spoil the movie for me.  Honestly though they are two entirely different stories.  While the movie's fun the book goes so much more in depth about how the world reacts initially to a zombie apocalypse and handles it in the long term.  There's so much though put into world building here which in itself would make the book worthwhile, but the world is framed by some really great characters who I wished we'd seen more of.  This wasn't just a great zombie book or a great sci-fi book, its just a great book.  I highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|you should get it . It is so much fun . I love how you can get different minions . You should get it .
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|This movie was one I went into with little expectations since most movies don't have that scare factor anymore but this movie really amazed me. It was definitely scary and I found myself having to hold my friend's hand during some parts because of the scare factor. Now I have seen the movie twice and I would recommend it to anyone who loves good old fashioned scary movies.
B004XZR63M|5.0|If your at all asking those questions about your current position in life , then you are ready to take on this book that will not only answer most of those questions but it will shape and change your life forever-- BUT it is only possible with YOUR commitment...

B009NG1Q96|5.0|Much like the first book I could not put this down. I can't wait until the last book to see what happens.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|love this app! you can drive like a maniac and break your neck as many times as you want. but the features are too limited. conversely should add an air plane and/or train vehicle and a shopping mall map where you have to drive through people. the driver like retarded, so they should add people to the store. but overall, the app is AMAZING!!
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|This is very nice and keeps my child interest longer then the rest of the Dr. Panda apps. Easy for 4 yr. old to play.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Great movie except too many curse words for younger audiences. There are so many young actors that eventually became famous. Lots of fun to watch them in this movie.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I love this game, have definitely become addicted to it. Good graphics and gameplay, my only caveat is that there are times it doesn't log in or servers and client software have connection issues.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This book literally changed my view of the world. It's made me more aware, and also more vocal about the atrocities of factory farming. It's well written and easy to follow. Please read this book. It's important.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|A must for everyone who like Apple, and or the technological revelution we have seen fot the last 40 years.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Great scary classic movie.  Glad I added it to my home movie collection.  My daughter and her friends loved it!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Who doesn't like this album from the early 70's?  It was Led Zeppelin III and Tapestry in my young world!  And at a great price too...
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  The characters interact well with each other and the author brings humor to almost every page. A wonderful read!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I was never a Swift fan BUT I heard this album on a Delta flight to Europe and instantly enjoyed it...so I bought it and have not stopped listening to it.  Great Summer music...
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I don't read a lot of books about writing any more. Gone are the college days of memorizing Strunk and White and reading John Gardner's book about fiction writing. But I've enjoyed Stephen King's books for a long time, and I heard such good things about this book that I had to check it out. What surprised me was that much of the book wasn't so much about how to write, but an autobiography of how a bestselling author came to be. Even when describing his childhood, King shows what a storyteller he is. There's a lot to learn just from that.<br /><br />In his \\"Toolbox\\" section, he gets more into the--oh God, here it comes--nuts and bolts of things. I like that he does mention Strunk and White and grammar in general, as well as the active vs. passive writing. I also agree with the \\"closed door\\" policy, at least in that the first draft shouldn't have your editorial side looking over your shoulder. He gives a nice example of a short story before and after editing, which I found encouraging, because it looked like what I already do.<br /><br />Some information regarding publishing is outdated, but overall, I found this a good book for aspiring writers to read, both for information and inspiration.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Another album I heard on a Delta flight to Europe by accident.  Great hooks and melodies from handsome Mr Levine and Co!  Every song is good...
B009TTGM3C|1.0|Terry G. is the man but Damon puts the movie in the toilet at every turn. I guess this is before his bourne identity stuff but it's really not worth watching unless you're a Gilliam fan.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I loved season one and season two is just as perfect. I can't wait to see season 3. TV heaven!!!! It's got drama and romance and excellent acting and the best story ever.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Well written, fast paced, fun to read. I enjoy this author immensely! I highly recommend all of Rollins books for a  nice escape from reality. Great for those who like history, archaeology, and espionage.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|Last Fish is incredibly simple and easy to learn. You simply tilt your screen to move your fish to go through checkpoints and pick up food. While not very flashy, but it's still fun. The game has plenty of levels, achievements to earn, score goals to obtain, and an arcade mode to play in. For 99 cents, this game is an excellent  buy.
0448444216|3.0|I was disappointed in this version because I had read that the web and strands were supposed to poke out....like shiny glue on the page that the child could touch.  This book didn't have that...also the flaps seemed unnecessary and actually seem to get in the way of the story more than enhance it.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I thought is was more for kids and youg adults my error. Maybe another time or on ad offering state of mind.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I highly recommend this series for anyone interested in fantasy literature, and even for some people who would not normally venture into this genre.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book is well written and the author is certainly believable.  I am a bit of a sceptic when it comes to &#34;near death experiences&#34; regarding both what they are and what they mean.  This was an enjoyable read and I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to pull together a picture of what dying may be like.  For me, it is just another piece in the puzzle and certainly not the whole picture.  As far as the title is concerned, &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;, I am not in agreement.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|What's not to love?  Four beautiful men with gorgeous voices and songs I love to hear them sing.  I love it!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Not just another solitaire game.  This one is funnier and very easy on the eyes. I am hooked. Enjoy .
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|This movie I'd consider enjoyable for adults as well as children. It was entertaining, and I didn't fall asleep or start doing chores while it was on (that usually means it didn't hold my attention). It was good though. I think most people will enjoy it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The finale was tough to swallow, but I really think Season 3 managed to keep everything about Downton that we love and delivered more.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|The movie was spectacular to watch, especially on a high definition television, but the characters just weren't memorable, and the two main characters left me confused. I wanted to like them, but it just didn't do it for me. The movie was average.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|Better late then never....but 2005!!!!????....oh well....at least I found it during 2013.<br /><br />In my opinion this is what God intended music to sound like. For me it just doesn't get any better then this. Since it's arrival I have listened to it everyday....the song, \\"Ghost Love Score\\" has become my all time favorite song. every time i listen to it, it gives me chills, excites me, inspires me, gets my fists pumping, and makes me cry all at the same time. The talent of these musicians is awe inspiring! They create a sound as big as any orchestra I've ever heard....it's freaking incredible!<br /><br />....it's too bad there no longer together with, \\"Tarja\\" but it doesn't really matter because I have the DVD....but of course I do wish she could somehow get back into the band....<br /><br />I guess at 53 years old I've missed a lot of great bands over the last 20 years....it sucks to be old....but some how this group got my attention....thank you to Youtube!<br /><br />Nightwish rules!  ....symphonic power metal  !!!!!!!!!<br />....now that's what I'm talking about!<br />....this is my type of music!<br /><br />Now that it's been a few months since making this review plus doing some reading on the history of the band I would like to say this, \\" I don't care what the reasons were or anything else. Nightwish boy's, you screwed up when you fired Tarja! Again, I don't care what the reason was. It's like when Ace Frehley was fired from Kiss....everyone has excuses for there decisions....doesn't make them right. everything Nightwish has done since Tarja left sucks!  Bands should have all the original members otherwise the name should be changed. Thuomas and Emppu, get over yourselves! I won't be purchasing anything to do with your band until you apologize to Tarja and bring her back....oh, but guess what she doesn't wnat to come back....see what you've done.  Good job you bunch of idiots!
B009R659L8|3.0|The story was interesting but there were many characters making it somewhat difficult to follow. Overall, it was satisfactory but not exciting.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|All of his books are good and give amazing insight to the human emotions, this one had me in tears too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought it took real guts for erin to take charge of her life even though she feared for her life. I also loved how Alex supported katie
0767824571|5.0|What kind of a review do you need, African or European? I suppose I could attach a small string under the dorsal guiding...
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I don't even care that not all of it was realistic. I just love guns, violence, and explosions and this had lots of that. So 5 stars!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Read it...and reread it after the movie came out wondering what I missed. Nowhere in the book were any of the events from the movie, which would have made the book better. Great idea and some really good reading, but much too long for a book that eludes to resolving the zombie plague, but leaves that part out. Overall, interesting, but frustrating.
B001974DG0|5.0|Dean Koontz is a fantastic writer.  I especially loved the dog in this book.  Wouldn't it be great to communicate with our animals?
B005WUHAX8|4.0|The case works are expected. I would purchase again in the future if I needed one for another phone. .
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I should have seen this movie earlier. It was MUCH better than I thought it would be. There were times that I was laughing out loud, and I am not in that habit at all.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Good depiction of a true story.  Great acting.  Very believable.  Seems like a lot of movies about the &#34;triumph of the human spirit&#34; can get off course with the side stories but this one stayed on point. Really enjoyed it.
B00005JLCI|4.0|I have learned to enjoy and have confidence in anything Kenneth Branagh stars in and directs. This work is no exception. The sets are lavish, and the themes are presented in a way that is certainly understandable to the Shakespeare novice. I loved his version of Henry 5, so I expected the same treat here. And I got it. Almost. Mr Branagh elected to include a few American movie and TV actors in his cast, and the difference (most of the time) in the acting styles was jarring. Also, this very talented performer decided to include every single bit of dialogue Shakespeare ever wrote for this play. And, while it was wonderfully presented, there is a reason this work is carefully edited before being normally being produced on a stage. I ran out of popcorn long before &#34;Goodnight sweet Prince&#34; was finally intoned. Good try. Well worth study. Take cushions to sit on.

B009UZBLSG|1.0|Just got this in the mail for my nexus 7 FHD not sure what the problem is.<br /><br />I've tried 3 different HDMI brands all pretty cheap (Amazon basic, Rosewill, Monster etc.)<br />Non of these produced any results except for the rosewill cable which gave me a not supported!<br />message instead of a no signal message.<br /><br />I can say after all the slimport hype for the Nexus 7 FHD you'd think it would work out of the box<br />I really hope i dont have to return this product but i can't tell if its broken or the nexus 7<br />just dosent support it
0345803507|5.0|I really LOVED this book!! it was the perfect ending to a wonderful series I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves romance novels that are slightly twisted! and don't listen to the nay-sayers this book is not as bad (sexually) as some people make it out to be!!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I loved having choice of theatrical or updated release. The only to improve the experience would have been to include the fifth installment.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product works as advertised... I'm able to stream Netflix without a problem - the video and audio are just as clear as when streaming through my bluray.  I haven't had any of the jerkiness or audio problems that other users have reported.  Also streamed Google Play Music without an issue.<br /><br />The main thing for me is - I have a large plasma 1080i TV, and I've tried Roku and Apple TV with no success - they don't display other than 1080p or 720p.  This worked right out of the box.  Set up was easy (used a tablet and then connected with my phone too (Nexus 7/Nexus 4)).  I see reports and rumors of more support - Redbox, HBO Go, Vimeo, etc.  If Amazon Prime video covers it I'll be golden.
B00821OX98|3.0|it was interesting at first. but am finding it to be like all the other,end of world shows.but will keep watching maybe will get different.

B000O176Q6|5.0|I am sure that ANYONE who claims to be a martial arts fan and hasn't seen or owns this movie...well, then they are not a fan!! This is an amazing movie. It's fight scenes are hands down amazing!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It was interesting but way too clinical for the average reader.  I was waiting for more description of what was seen and his actual journey.  I think his writing is like medical journal writing and I am sure he is a brilliant neurosurgeon but has problems putting his experience in layman's terms.  I actually lost interest half way through the book.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I love Joe Wright.  I love Keira Knightley, Matthew McFayden, and Jude Law.  I love Leo Tolstoy and Anna Karenina is one of my favorite books - a beautifully rich story about love, lust, loss, and all things Russian.  With this all said, it's difficult to both not like, and to like, Wright's film.<br /><br />The post-modern approach to setting each scene on a &#34;stage&#34; just didn't work and it actually took away from the important context of the story.  I understand why Wright wanted to do this but it just doesn't work.  The setting of this story has everything to do with who the characters are and why the story is so tragic.  I wanted to see more of the countryside to understand Levin; more of St. Petersburg as the backdrop for Anna and Vronsky's heated attraction.  The weird theater backdrops not only didn't add to the landscape of the story, they took something away from it.<br /><br />I love Aaron Taylor-Johnson.  He was great in Kick Ass (don't be a hater - watch the film.  It's hilarious) and he was wonderful in Albert Nobbs.  The kid can act and he's very good looking.  But Vronksy's character is complex; yes he's a naive kid in many ways, but he's also sophisticated enough to match Anna in wit and in worldliness.  Taylor-Johnson was not old enough for this role and was not convincing.  I think a more experienced actor - maybe someone like Tom Hardy who is wonderful in period works, would have been good.<br /><br />Keira was wonderful.  Her clothes were spectacular; elegantly beautiful.  She was Anna - through and through.  The supporting actors were great too - especially Levin and Kitty.  But where was Levin's story?  The beauty of Anna Karenina is that Tolstoy balances out the story of false love / lust (Anna's affair with Vronsky) with what real love / commitment really are (Levin and Kitty's story).  I wanted more of Levin's story but of course, an almost 800 page book is hard to fit into a 2 to 3 hour film.<br /><br />I think this film is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the novel and or of Joe Wright's work.  But keep in mind it's flawed.
140006922X|5.0|I purchased this as an audio book, I will now buy a hard copy.  This was the most thought provoking and easiest to understand book on the historical Jesus I have read to date.  First off, Fox should be embarrassed by the recent interview, that was sad.  The Author's religious background has nothing to do with his ability to write a historical account of Jesus.  Frankly, I am so tired of the bastardized embellished Christology that I was raised with and listen to every Sunday.  The Jesus of my faith deserves to be understood in the context of his time.  This notion that everything has to be taken on faith just goes a bit too far.  I believe in the empty tomb, I believe as mentioned in the book that something happened to the original followers which made them continue this story, even in the face of torture and death.  While I understand and have seen others in history that can influence people to do things that one would not expect, this particular story is fascinating and worthy of my faith.  But, at the same time, I don't need made up tales, I don't need embelishments, I need truth.  I want to understand why Jesus was led to a cross, I want to understand what he taught, did he ever say he was the Son of God in a theological sense?  Well, I think I got my answer.  If you read the book with your Bible close by, it makes sense.  I do find it crazy that last night, I went to the New Testament and found one book dedicated to James, the actual brother of Jesus.  Stop the nonsense, Jesus likely did have a family, probably even a wife.  But why James is narrowed down to about 4 pages of my Bible, Peter roughly 3 books, and then Luke and Paul make up the new testament.  What a coincidence.  Has anyone taken the time to think about that?  Has anyone bothered to think that it might make more sense to give a bit more credence to a man who lived with and learned from Jesus as opposed to a man who persecuted the followers of Jesus then had a mysterious encounter and says he speaks to Jesus spirit on a daily basis?  Come on, I take the man who ate and breathed the same air, the person who was close to the story, the person who most likely saw and understood what the empty tomb was.  I cannot but someone who did not know the man, shaping what I have been taught and what is being taught to my children.  This is all compounded by what was put together as dogma in the 300s.  Clearly this was all influenced by Paul.  So, yes, I welcomed a refreshing look at the interpretation of the new testament in light of the history and frankly, the very few available facts about Jesus.  So, before you sentence and send this Author to Golgotha, give the book a chance and read it with an open mind.  You will be exposed to history, granted, there are most likely assumptions and mistakes, but learn the history of the times.  If you want Christology, read the 4 gospels.  In my mind, the history makes the Gospels come to life, makes me appreciate the man Jesus was, makes me realize more than ever, somehow, someway, that he truly was the Son of God, He came for a divine purpose and I will see the fruits of that someday.  It is very complicated, but, I think we have so much to learn from the history.  Peel back the onion as I have heard other Scholars say.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Great acting (although not sure Channing Tatum was the best guy for his character's role) in any case - interesting plot and a conflict that makes one consider our society's over-reliance on prescription meds.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Having read the book first I was pleased with the way the movie developed and followed the plot.<br />Being an out of doors person and from North Carolina this was a fun movie.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I saw Shia LeBeouf for the first time in Disturbia.  The film is a teenage thriller but I watched it and kept thinking, this kid will win an Oscar one day.  He's a good actor.  Tom Hardy is good in everything I've seen him in - as Bane, as Heathcliff, as Bronson; where did this guy come from and how can anyone be so damned good looking and so talented??? This movie is great.  Wonderful script, wonderful acting, great suspense.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It wont let me play at all. It freezes all the time. Wont let me exit when i enter the game

B002XBVQKW|5.0|Acting, singing, dancing, comedy, drama, plot, cinematography, direction, production, cast... this film has it all and it is put together well.  The entire cast is spot on and everyone sounds and looks great.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Instead of watching this film, rent the movie Sleeping with the Enemy starring Julie Roberts.  This story is basically the same story but the acting, dialogue, and suspense in that film were wonderful.  This movie was so boring and predictable I started surfing the net.  Josh Duhamel is hot but that was the highlight of this film.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is basically the same as escape if you can but much better, its great, the only thing i would change would be to add more levels
B0055OK2T0|3.0|The &#34;idea&#34; or plot was great ... something just not write that kept the movie itself, however, from being great.<br />Acting was wonderful.  Matt great as usual.
030746363X|4.0|Great weight training ideas but some are pretty far out there.  Read about the nightly ice baths and you will understand what I mean.  I'm not willing to freeze my girl parts everynight in a cold tub just to lose weight, but it is an interesting theory.  Lots of well documented research so he really knows his stuff.  Not like other fluffy weight loss books.  He has exercises, pictures, suggestions for doctors, measuring tools etc.  Very insightful.

B0028RXXE8|3.0|This was not as vital a series as I was expecting and kind of hit a sort of soap box series. With the exception of Octavian the characters were not developed in a strong and binding manner. While very different, Spartacus, the series of the Roman Slave Rebellion that took place at about the same time in history and has many of the same characters and character references is most extraordinarily done.

B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Whether you're American or not it's darn hard to not feel for these guys.  Having spent time aboard a US sub not only do I feel for this crew but I feel spoiled in comparison.<br /><br />This is one of the finest movies to show the true camaradrie of a submarine crew.  You eat, sleep, work, and dream as a crew.  It cannot be helped.  You've nobody but your fellow shipmates to keep you alive and going.  That would be just as true ashore as it is underway.<br /><br />It's clich&eacute; to say it, but a crew is a family.  They argue and fight amongst themselves but as soon as an outsider gets involved the dicotomy changes.  It is no longer us against us but us against them.<br /><br />Before I had deployed aboard a US Sturgeon class sub (637 class), Das Boot taught me the true meaning of shipmates.  I had already spent half my career aboard a variety of ships and in flight status but nothing compared to the closeness of crew.<br /><br />Undoubtably one of the finest war movies ever made.  When my youngest son, born long after I had retired, asked me to tell him about my sub life, we watched Das Boot together and I taught him what I could.<br /><br />One day I hope to do the same with my SIL's sons, my grandsons.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This is probably one of my all time favorite movies. I downloaded it on my kindle fire because I was going into the hospital and wanted something to keep me busy. The download itself does take some time
B005U9REU0|5.0|This movie was my favorite when i was a child. My daughter loved this movie also. It really opens up the imagination of a child
B008133MDK|5.0|The writing is exceptional, the acting is impeccable, the cinematography is excellent. This has the feel of a movie, not a TV series and certainly NOT a made-for-TV American movie. Sherlock Holmes is much more callous and arrogant than his literary counterpart in this series, though this season gives you a glimpse of hope that his arrogance is tempered a bit.  It is not, in my opinion, appropriate for kids under high school age because of some sexual content and innuendo.<br /><br />The only episode that I didn't like was the one involving Irene Adler even though it had a brilliant beginning and some of the best lines in the series (\\"I always hear 'hit me in the face' when you're talking but it is usually subtext\\").  In the book, she was supposed to be kind as well as brilliant.  However, with one exception, in which she rises to Sherlock's challenge to solve one of his cases, she doesn't appear to be very smart, just manipulative and cruel.  It is also an episode which I will not allow my young teen daughter to watch because of all the overt sexual content with S&M undertones.<br /><br />My daughter and husband also love this series and we are eagerly anticipating being able to watch Season 3 (hint, hint, BBC).
0062255657|1.0|I guess there are a lot of Gaiman fans out there.  I never heard of the guy, but so what.<br /><br />I bought this book based on so many good reviews and raves about \\"Gaiman\\".  This is one book that I am glad was as short as it was, was as easy to read as it was, was able to skim it and get 99.99% of its content in order to finish it as quickly as I did so as not to waste any more time on some inane Gaiman spiritual nonsense.

B0002VFXFE|1.0|One star seems harsh, but, people for some reason absolutely insist on using this product, when it is technology that is now well over 10 years old.<br /><br />It's as simple as this:<br /><br />1) This product contains metal particles. It is *conductive*. If you get even a speck of this on your board or pins in the right place, it can destroy the entire board.<br /><br />2) There is simply a ton of data that shows that Arctic Silver 5 is now greatly outperformed by more recent technology.<br /><br />There are a lot of compounds to choose from, personally, I recommend MX-4. It's made by the same company that makes Silver 5, it's 100% non conductive (it's ceramic based), and it outperforms Silver 5 by miles.<br /><br />Arctic Silver 5 was a five star product back in 2002. In 2013, based on the performance of *many* other available compounds, it's a one. As stated above... as simple as that.

140006922X|4.0|Learning the history of the times leading up to the ministry of Jesus, as well as the first 100 years after his death, is an absolute necessity for one to have a full view of early Christianity.  This book is a wonderful narrative resource for that information.  What I found less than useful was the attempt by the author to understand the mind of Jesus by way of this historical information.  In fact I find the author's belief that Jesus was perhaps just one more zealot in a string of zealots unbelievable.  I think it is much more plausible to think of Jesus as a highly intelligent person rather than a more sophisticated pawn of the radical coming new world order thinking of his age.  It seems to me the sayings of Jesus most bungled or ignored by the author are the sayings of Jesus that imply the Kingdom of God is an internal world.  There have always been Christians who have interpreted the message of Jesus from this perspective.  The author does not believe Jesus taught this perspective but instead believes Jesus taught an end of days message that did not pan out.

0812550706|4.0|Science Fiction is the genre that made me love reading.  I began with it before branching out to Fantasy.  I'd heard for years how Ender's Game is a classic of SciFi. I'd read many of the greats, like Asimov, Heinlein, and McCaffrey, but never got around to it until now.  I regret waiting!<br /><br />In the future, Earth has endured two invasions of the Buggers, an insect-like species that is trying to colonize our planet.  Expecting another invasion, the military has resorted to finding genius-level children to train into the ultimate force, with one special child as the Fleet commander.  It was inevitable that the \\"big plot twist\\" would have been spoiled for me with the book out for nearly 30 years.  Never-the-less, the story and protagonist sucked me in immediately and the ending still managed to hold some surprises. Card weaves his \\"technobabble\\" seamlessly into the plot so readers can picture this world without feeling lost, and though supporting characters don't get enough development, Ender is never less than real. I think everyone has felt like an outcast at one time or another, and struggled with who they want to be rather than who others want them to be. This makes Ender instantly relatable, which is critical since the book is told almost exclusively from his POV.<br /><br />Where I think the book falls down a bit is the ending after the big reveal. This book is very short, and the conclusion makes that glaringly obvious.  It was rushed, and Card added more than one \\"epilogue\\" to the tale that felt tacked on. It was almost as if he was sure the book would be a failure and he wanted readers to know where the world would end up.  I wish he/his editors had fleshed out the conclusion to give it the weight and substance it deserved.<br /><br />Overall: Ender's Game, though flawed, is still a brilliant work of SciFi that deserves the awards and praise heaped upon it. I enjoyed it immensely and will definitely read some more of the series. It's been said, but bears repeating: if you love Science Fiction, you owe it to yourself to read this classic of the genre.rs repeating: if you love Science Fiction, you owe it to yourself to read this classic of the genre.

B000FC146C|5.0|We first read this epoch novel in 1978 and were blown away by it. Colleen McCollough  is an incredible writer who succeeds in bringing to life not only great characters and a great story but also makes life in the Australian outback as real as it can be short of actually being there.  We decided to re-read The Thorn Birds last month and bought the paperback and the Kindle edition from Amazon. It was money well spent! This book covers three generations of people who experience and endure hardships, heartbreak and unrelenting drama. It's a long read but one that never allows the reader to lose interest or want to skim ahead. An amazing display of the author's creative and narrative skills and a book which rates as high as possible. Read it again for yourself and see if you don't agree.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|My husband and I have been hooked on British drama lately, so we added this to the pile. It was fun and entertaining. Not quite the quality of D.A., which may explain why the show was cancelled after Season 2 but fun to watch nonetheless. Too bad there's not more of it to enjoy in the off season.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I think this story is great and also very sad because katniss losses everyone she cares for but very very sad
B005PK57IK|5.0|Good plots, interesting legal issues, find the characters interesting and the actors perfect for the parts. Look forward to seeing season 4 !!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The only app for everything you do! Absolutely love this app and rely on it for everything - notes, ideas, recipes, etc. That it's free makes it that much better.
B00DS5YUV4|5.0|Works great if you use the right settings, for example, turn on WiFi when i reach the cell tower near my house, or turn on Bluetooth when the vehicle is moving, turn on car mode when car is moving also. and so on, overall, very good software.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that you should get this game .. it is free and its better than temple run and subway surfers  I highly recommend it :) love this game
140006922X|5.0|This is a book for a thinking person.  If you dislike the author's religion and want to disparage the book on that basis, you probably won't even like the fact that its been published.
140006922X|1.0|Honestly, I would like an author to have some expertise in the field of either history or religion/christianity but Mr. Aslan has none. One star garbage.  I find it ironic that a muslim writes a book about Jesus. True Christian believers will not react with violent threats like many muslims do when someone writes negatively of mohammed.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|This CD takes me back to an era of really, really good music.  Nobody can sing like Robert Plant, not then and not now.  Sexiest male voice ever!  Paige is so very talented and Bonham was amazing.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|When I hear the word infinite I think of forever young. Living that moment in your life and not worried about anything else. In perks of being a wallflower I resembled myself, as in I was Charlie and my two best friends were Patrick and Sam. It made it much more interesting and as me only being a teenager and being lost in thought of who I am or want to be,the book gave me a great point of view. Which in fact was a teens point of view. The book was full of wonder, and gave it that great \\"want to read more\\" feeling. I will indeed remember this book!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I loved season 3 of Downton  Abbey.  I missed all three of the seasons and was so happy to watch them on my Kindle Fire HD with Amazon.  Now I am hooked and can't wait for season 4!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book, l love the story keep you wanting more. Can't wait for the last book!! You will love this.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I've now rented it twice for my kids, I should of just bought it the first time!!! It's a really fun movie!!!!
B009E20IB6|1.0|These 3 short stories have nothing to do with Harry Bosch and they only cover 50% of the book. The rest are excerpts from other Connelly books. Very disappointing!!
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Loved the book. Love the movie. They left some things out that I believe were important.  I still love it!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles. Most intelligent game I've played in a long time
B00COHAUD4|5.0|very breath taking , keep you trilled from beginning to ending<br />we give 5 stars to this movie , we enjoy it
0802473156|4.0|Very good book to read before and after you get married! I highly recommend it! The test is good for both guys and girls to take!

B007712XAU|5.0|We all love this series the first time we saw it we were hooked! I ordered my own copy so we could watch it again with friends! Love it!
B000N5F6OW|5.0|Great movie all around love John Wayne  Picture was excellent and sound was great.  Red Buttons awesome too.  Great scenes of Africa
B008X5XP9M|5.0|I love military history and stories of heroic battles.  This certainly falls into the latter category.<br /><br />I have seen the movie countless times, but I really wanted to get more of the full story.  This book gives you so much more than the movie did.  Without revealing spoilers, I will simply say that the timeline of the movie was a lot shorter than that of the book.<br /><br />I really appreciated not only the respect of the american's involved, but also the respect the author gave the citizens of the Mog.  He didn't just glorify the battle, but instead he exposes American wrongs, Somalian wrongs, and even UN wrongs.<br /><br />I was left respecting the efforts and heroism of the Americans in the battle, but also wondering what business we had being there to begin with.<br /><br />This book pulls no punches and gives what seems to be a very accurate portrayal of a bloody conflict in which there was no winner.
0152465073|5.0|This timeless classic is of immediate appeal to children because of the sweet and childlike faith of the title character, yet it expresses eternal truths which insightful adult readers will appreciate. On a miniscule planet in a distant galaxy a little prince (indeed, the only human inhabitant) is concerned about a vain lady rose, who demands protection from claws and jaws which might land on the unnamed planetoid. Gentlemanlike he sets off in search of adult aid (no space ship required) to visit several other small planets--which offer him no solution to the problem of his feminine rose. Just boring adults like a King and a businessman, who are so engrossed in their grown-up affairs that they dismiss him as irrelevant and bothersome.<br /><br />  After visiting several places with no result the little prince lands on Earth, in the African desert, in fact. The adult protagonist proves to be a pilot (like the author) whose plane has landed needing repairs. But the little prince fixates on getting help, so he begs the kind man to draw him first a sheep, then a muzzle for it. Fortunately the cooperative pilot is an amateur artist as well. During their sojourn the pilot learns something of history of the little fellow--who is obsessed with his responsibility to his only rose.<br /><br />  Two animals also figure in his Earth sojourn: a shy fox who has to teach the Little Prince how to tame him (a study in patience and trust) and at the end a snake who helps the Prince return to his home planet. (Bob Fosse moves with coiled grace in the live-actor movie version.) We can not quite bring ourselves to trust him, but the little Prince accepts his offer of help without fear. Crushed by the disappearance (or seeming death) of the Little Prince, whom he has grown to love, the Pilot completes his repairs and regretfully departs. The ending may seem somewhat sad but most readers realize that the little man in the long coat is back on his home planet, with its one extinct volcano,honorably protecting his vain rose from wind and wild animals. A sweetly poignant tale of loyalty and compassion, tenderly told by a French author, this widely translated story is cherished in both book and movie formats by children of all ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It it a horse game lol play play play all new add as a friend ah ah ah aha ha ah ah
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I love this CD and it has a lot of Van Morrison's great songs and music.  We listened to this traveling from California to Minnesota and it made the trip more enjoyable.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I like the app,but when I'm watching the videos they randomly stop.Also when I click the video it won't load.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Though this product delivers info about the weather it is often difficult to read the first page.  Today, for example, there are pretty pink flowers as background but the white writing superimposed can hardly be read.  I still can't read the &#34;feels like&#34; temp.<br />There are also too many clouds on the hourly screen: again I can't read the white text.<br /><br />Maybe black text or a less busy background would help.<br /><br />dm
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Lots of fun to play. Love that you can see the changes in your dragons as you &quot;grow them up&quot;. And no rotted crops when you go back to the game, awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am 24 and I think this game if fun :) it is great for kids too but I hate the darn cars lol.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I only wish that they have all of the seasons available on prime like Netflix does its a rely good 80s TV show.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Amazon makes you login to app store just to play this game. This game hasent been updated in forever. Download on google play only. The amazon app is garbage.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|each story stands alone ...and...contiunes the saga of the gang of geeks in pasadena.  science can be funny. entertaining as well as diverting
B000L53D4O|5.0|Didn't even bother with the stickers. Son started playing with it before we had a chance to out them on.  Figured he would just chew them off anyway :-). This became a fave toy even when just crawling. Lots of things to do & appreciate its a toy he likes that's not musical!
B00C8RFRNI|4.0|We watched this over the weekend.  While it certainly kept us on the edge of our seats, there are unanswered questions that are still nagging me.  A prisoner is waterboarded, chained, tortured and when he still won't talk he is put in a small box.  Next scene flips to several years later - how did the guy get out of the box???  Did David Copperfield &#34;magic&#34; him out?  There were a lot of scenes that just left you hanging and went on to other years.  If you want to show me where you started and where you ended, please show me more how you got there.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|C D More than lived up to the show. Billy Porter & Stark Sands are outstanding as was Lauper's music
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My hubby loves animation (I do not).  He found this to be a funny film  Now he can't wait for the second one to come out on DVD.
B007SGM084|1.0|I am very disappointed in this book.  It is full of nasty stuff and not worth the time it would take me to read.
B0028MBKVG|3.0|Interesting read,  not sure if someone who was not into running would enjoy it.  Definately helps if you understandall the lingo and know who Scott Jurek, Dean Karnazes, Emil Kapotak etc are.  as some one who does (sort of) minimalist running I found it encouraging.  loved the evolutionary biology stuff too (but I am an bio nerd).  So if you run and are a science geek you wll love this book, otherwise i don't know...
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This story never grows old and the characters represented here give 'hope' for the world and for all of us as humans living together.......
B000002G89|5.0|I went to a concert long ago when Clapton was showcasing the material from this CD.  It's always been some of my favorite Clapton.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|doesn't allow kindle to snooze, runs down the battery. does not save progress on levels so lots of repeat work to play. strange logic really frustrates my kids. good thing his was a freebie.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|I enjoy the characters and the storylines of this show. Can't wait for season three. Reminds me of White Collar, another USA show that I enjoy.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|love it on the kindle because i can check everything all the time and not have to sign onto my laptop.......
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Powerful. Kid Rock and Jeff Beck guests are fantastic. Shorty is great musician proving that some child stars can make it in adulthood.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A well acted, spellbinding story with as many plot lines as rooms at Downton Abby. Dame Maggie Smith just keeps getting better.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|Honestly, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Back when Seagall and VanDamme were real action heroes and everyone thought they were the best... this is a whole new level of awesomeness.<br /><br />Entourage and now this?! I think I have a new favorite actor.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini does it again.  Amazing story.  I love the way that he writes so eloquently mixing  people’s entire lives together for generations.  Its amazing.<br />I am in love with this book !!! I have read books by this author before and he did not disappoint me with this book.
B00C0NFMKI|3.0|There are 4 songs on the whole CD I like, out of 17 tracks. The rest is slow, toned down and boring. This is their worst CD compared to the previous albums. You may just want to get the tracks you like, instead of the whole CD.  There are 3 tracks where Haley is singing with a ukulele playing for 2 minutes...  stupid.
B005DJRD80|2.0|I think this show could have value, but it's simply not believable.  It's suggested to us in the pilot that the main girl and her friends are some sort of outcast nerds, but they all look like models, so it's simply not believeable at all.  The main character is not \\"awkward\\" - she's a teen model.  This is no \\"My So Called Life\\" by any means.  I'm not bothered by the teen sex, because yeah, that happens.  But I'm bothered when someone tells me I should believe that gorgeous actresses are nerds (while the fat girl is the bully?  Ridiculous).  Should have been better.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The show is sexy fun powerful and exciting. The only negative thing I have to say about it is when it is schduled something else pre emps it.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I always says that I can't play unless I get the new version but I don't know how to get the new version. Can someone please tell me how.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This reminds me of Mark Twain's comment about Classics -- everybody praises them but nobody reads them.<br />But this is one that deserves to be read.  If you have not read it, treat yourself to this compelling tale told by the French master.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Must read! I learned to lean in and never looked back! Every woman should read this and it would would informational for men as well
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is a great follow up to Ender's Game. There was no way Card could out do the brilliance of Ender's Game, but this is a great transitional book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best books ever. Just saying. I literally don't read anything else unless it's required for school or something. I would recommend it for ages 12 through 25?
B008133MDK|5.0|By the second season the plots were getting more and more confusing.  I suspect Stephen Moffett thought he was still writing Dr. Who..  But I still enjoyed the whole season and wish there was more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's the best app ever it is so amazing works every time. Every time I play this game I get so addicted to it. I love this game.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Holmes would not recognize himself in this new group of films, but I suspect he would enjoy them.  Benedict Cumberbatch makes a believer out of you, and Watson is perfect.  I wish they had made more of them.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm it aloud me to wake up to my favourite songs and help me wake up by forcing me to do some math. So I start my day off with my education. I'm ready to start my day to nice peaceful music instead of loud annoying beeping sound. Thank you &quot;Alarm Clock Xtreme Free!&quot; Might I make a suggestion? &quot;You should make it so have to draw a picture, or solve a puzzle game, or a small puzzle.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Rachel Joyce uses Harold's walk the length of England to visit a terminally ill friend from the past as a means to<br />reveal his life - his marriage, his relationship with his son and the world at large.  There are numerous layers in the story<br />providing insite as to how different people respond to Harold's eccentric decision to deliver his response personally to his long forgotten dying friend.  This is an orginal and captivating story on, relationships, how humans relate, their frailties and their differences.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Amazing! Was sad to reach the end.  The Room 2 hurry up! I'm going to play again. You should buy this game.  It's a steal at 1.99$.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Challenging friends is fun but I enjoy challenging myself more.  Beating a previous personal high score is fun for me.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|First of all  if you got the netflix deal, this thing could be considered free. Let ignore the cost of the doggle and look at the cost of the accesories that came with it. A hdmi extender, usb charger and usb cable would cost around ~11 or more if you buy it at Best Buy or any retails. The netflix deals last 3 months, which total to 8 x 3 = 24. All these things added together already make this thing worth it. However, the functionality of the actual chromecast is still pretty lacking. I tried connecting to my computer and due to bad wifi or something, I get very bad picture quality and youtube videos lack. I rather just connect my pc to a hdmi cable and extend my screen. BEWARE if you have bad wifi.
B005LAII4E|4.0|I am at a loss to understand what people dislike about this movie. For JOE fans, its a very realistic and believable portrayal of an iconic franchise. And for the general movie goer, its an awesome action film with a great story and great characters. My one compliant is Duke's apparent death. He is my favourite character and I was hoping that these rumours about him dying were mis-information.<br /><br />However I do hope that he is brought back in some manner. Duke is one of the core elements that make GI Joe what it is and as the blowback with the recurring deaths of Optimus Prime from the Transformers franchise show, you cannot just ditch one of the best characters. And I like the fact that like Duke, Channing Tatum himself as a genuinely good person as well (Its very rare in his profession and its a reason why he's one of my favourite actors). Its this quality that was also a reason why I really enjoyed seeing Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as General Joseph Colton. Jonathan Pryce is equally excellent as a villian and as a good guy and the portrayals of Lady Jaye, Flint, Jinx, Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow were pitch-perfect. The story itself is really well written and, as previously mentioned, a very realistic take on the franchise.<br /><br />This is a much better movie than other reviewers say and - provided that Duke is brought back and Channing Tatum plays him again - I'm looking forward to the next film in the series. Hopefully we'll also the return of the Baroness and that Joseph Gordan-Levitt will come back as Cobra Commander.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It is a fascinating read and has many subplots that eventually tie together.  A very good look at another culture.
B004H0M8EA|3.0|Jared's prospective and information is a little bias to prove his points but that is the case with most writers.  I think he presents some good information and an interesting perspective that engages thought and further research into the topic.  His writing style is repetitive so it makes it a little hard to get through the book but when you lean to skim past all that it's fun information to discuss.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Interesting game,but runs slow right when you need food and gold. Also takes to long for gaining experience.  PEACE TO ALL!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun app to play you should get this app it's super fun to play super awesome app to play
B00B7Y0206|2.0|ok so i got this app because YouTube apparently changed it's layout on my kindle a few days back and I was surprised amazon didn't even have a YouTube app.  anyways, i got this and i don't like how you can't see suggested videos or see a YouTuber's page and see their videos.  on top of that when i watch a video it plays for probably 12 seconds and then it loads and it repeats that over and over. it's like it the video says it's 5 minutes long be prepared for it to actually be 8-15 minutes long. some videos work fine but most don't. please fix this!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well it's the best minecraft ever it's sooooo worth your money if I'm not dancing or singing I'm playing minecraft!!!
B00138CYD4|5.0|Has all the great hits and all the great songs.  Very good quality MP3.  Get this and for sure you will not regret it!
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Boy, I sure took my time about this review, I bought this in 2006, lol. It's a terrific double CD of one of the best woman who ever sang. She was out when I was in my 20's and I always loved her music, she will always be sadly missed. I have always kept in in my SUV all these years, I let it rumble too, it has great sound if you have the speakers for this. Donna Summer, she is, and was one of the best!
B0062O85IW|4.0|I learned excel on my own about 20 years ago and use it every day for work.  This book has helped me alot learn all the new things and has increased my productivity.  I recomend this for those who use excel on a dialy basis
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Downloaded this item on my kindle but do not like it.  I can not search easily on this app.  Will probably take it off of my kindle.  One site required me to download java but I could not do it on my kindle.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Can not beat this at this price.  Great collection of oldies rock.  Great sound for a great musical artist. Absolutely a must have collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP. Very challenging. It reads keeps me on my toes. Can you escape leaves your brain challenged but not overwhelmed.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This was a great movie. I watched it 1st by myself then convinced my husband to watch it. He wants to buy it now!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|kindle is the best app for reading on android and mac devices.  it has the best selection, best prices, best deals
B004KPX4W2|5.0|or fade away.  Love it, RED 2 next.  The cast is awesome and the plot is a little light at the end, regardless very worthwhile.
B008Y729FU|4.0|This was the best crow movie of all time, the others were not so great. Rest in peace Brandon Lee
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|The best part of Quartet, directed by Dustin Hoffman, is not just that everyone is really playing the instruments you see them playing in the film; it's that the story is so believable.  You can see these people, so talented that they carry their music inside them, coming together as they age, fighting arthritis and encroaching dementia and the demons of their past to create something amazing.  I loved it.  What a treat.  The major stars are wonderful, but the secondary characters are equally winning.  Listen to the clarinet, the cello, the piano, and the voices - amazing.
B006QV30JU|5.0|I JUST LOVE MUSICALS, AND I HAVE LOVED THIS MOVIE SINCE I WAS A CHILD...  It's just a magical movie
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is simply amazing. Words cannot describe the beauty that Maiden has created here. When I hear the chorus of The Wicker Man, I just feel so elated that I almost cry.  Iron Maiden was always and will always be my favorite band. Their amazing songs just never get old to me, no matter how much I hear them.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|i can't say if this lantern is a full 300 lumens, but I can say it's bright enough you don't want to look directly into the light. It works well camping and it's nice to have the cook on the bottom to hang it from the top of the tent. It's light enough that I wasn't worried about the tent supporting it's weight.<br /><br />Pros: uses only 3 D batteries (my Coleman uses 4) so it's lighter. It's fairly small. Has a handle to hold and a hook on the bottom to hang it.<br /><br />Cons: Battery cover on the bottom is a bit annoying to put on (I don't recommend doing this when it's dark as you have to line up a small slot (marked with a red arrow). Documentation is poor (as most things made in China, but you don't really need a manual to operate this thing). My biggest gripe (and the reason this gets 4 instead of 5 stars), is that the reflector isn't designed as well as it could be. It has a bright ring of light in the center which makes the lantern give off a harsh light and seems to always be shining directly into your eyes regardless of which viewing angle you are at. The only time I liked the light pattern was when I hung this lantern upside down from it's bottom hook at the top of my tent. When I did this, the top cover was facing down and acted to diffuse the light better. I don't know if it just my lantern, but it they made a nicer diffuser for this lantern, I would probably buy another one.<br /><br />For now, I'll look for a different lantern for additional camp light.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|my club selection started to be more accurate, then results occurred. my game speed improve. it will also allow yourself to have a better Idea of how to play the holes as well.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is my favorite book by Gaiman, and the conceit is fabulous.  All the ancient deities brought to the Americas have been or are being made irrelevant by people's rush into materialism.  As the gods try to stage a come-back, Gaiman superbly creates scenarios in which we see how they wield their powers today. His description os the gods whom time has completely forgotten is heart-wrenching. I would have liked the book to have been more tightly edited, but nonetheless I am a frequent re-reader.
B007EECSFA|3.0|I wasn't driven to read it.  And the ending got long.  But it was an okay story and many of my friends really enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|l have played it on other peoples electronics and I LOVED it but my stupid kindle fire wont let me install it. ):
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|not that informative and a pain getting to links on Kindle. Again, why offer it if you cant [lay Candy Crush on Kindle?
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I really enjoyed this, especially getting some back story from the show.  I cant wait to read the rest of the books.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|The movie speaks to me. It gives me hope and reminds me that all things happen for a reason. Even those things we may not understand and may be pretty bad end up providing us with something wonderful. When I am feeling down this movie always helps me restore my faith and believe in happy endings.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|The books give far more depth to the characters than provided in the Sweden movie trilogy or the recent American version.

B00006JKON|5.0|I love Ian Anderson and Jethro  Tull! I love early Jethro Tull and used to listen to Jethro Tull albums!!!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|One of the greatest books ever written.<br />Should be on ever shools reading list.<br />And it is worth rereading many times
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My sons still enjoy Lightning McQueen and the gang from Radiator Springs.<br /><br />I like the message behind the story; learn how to &#34;slow down and enjoy the people around you.&#34;
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|I am sure it is a good game but I could not get it to work, so I gave up ,hope to play it some day outher reviews say it was fun.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Like a present day Mad Men. Very addictive! Worth a watch. The two main characters are a good match of opposites. Very intrigued by the photographic memory plot-line. Good show.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Fun watching these actors easily slide through the nicely paced script to counteract the wild ride around them. Easy watching.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|This game was entertaining and interesting at first but it runs out of originality after you get farther along. It's repetitious and pointless and the missions became boring. The bonus dinosaurs that are limited availability don't show up even when I bought the extra chances to get them and the missions are just about spending money. The latest upgrade was disappointing and the Glacial Park ran out of missions already.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun.  But could be a little more challenging.  Good way to spend a little free time.  Would like to see more rooms.  I ran thru them pretty quick.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My setup: I've 3 laptops (all Win7), a Google Nexus One phone and a Samsung Galaxy Tab. I speak only for these devices.<br />One of the Win7 laptop was tied to the TV through HDMI as most of our TV viewing is Netflix (either from laptop or Wii or BD player), YouTube and few online shows offered free. I also watch live sports online usually directly on my other laptop.<br /><br />Packaging: The packaging was nor great neither bad. It was easy to open and had instructions for setup right there on the lid.<br />It came with an HDMI dongle with the edges covered with sticky film, a USB to mini-USB cord, a USB wall plug adapter and an HDMI extender.<br /><br />Device Setup: Connected the USB cord to the dongle, connected it to the wall adapter and plugged it into the wall socket that is right behind my TV. At this moment, the LED on the dongle started blinking (which I believe is to setup an ad-hoc network for Chromecast app to find it). Connected the HDMI dongle to my HDMI switch. My TV automatically switched source and displayed the home/welcome page with the device name. Opened chrome browser and went to [...] Downloaded the app, installed and ran it. Provided my wi-fi password (Only thing that took some time in the whole setup process because I could not remember this off the top of my head). The device connected to my wi-fi network. I could cast my browser tab once I installed the Google Cast extension for Chrome.<br /><br />What I was able to do:<br />1. As I mentioned above, I was able to cast my browser's tab. (This is in BETA and the system requirements probably apply for this feature).<br />2. When I tried casting a browser tab running YouTube, I was prompted that it would work better if casted directly from the app.<br />3. I was also able to cast local media supported by the browser by giving the full file path in the URL space or by dragging and dropping it in to the browser tab. (Note - This does not work on handheld devices, only works on Laptops/PCs).<br/>4. I was also able to mirror my laptop screen (not just the browser, but all other applications) with limited functionality, by selecting \\"Cast entire screen (experimental)\\" option in the Google Cast icon.<br /><br />Other observations:<br /> 1. YT / Netflix when casted from the apps themselves took about 15 seconds to load and also had 2-3 seconds lag for pause/resume.<br /> 2. When playing a playlist from YT, whenever a new video starts, it plays for a second or two, re-started and played without any issue.<br /> 3. I was able to cast the video from a G+ hangout by copying the URL in the pop-up and pasting it in a browser tab. Audio did not work.<br /> 4. I was able to play local media files such as mp3 and mp4. .mov files did not work. I had not tried other file types.<br /> 5. Adding a YT video to the queue from another device needs to work better.<br /><br />What I like about this product:<br /> 1. My laptop is now freed up from always being tied to the TV.<br /> 2. I/my wife could use all of our devices to control what's being played.<br /> 3. Casting YT/Netflix videos directly from the apps resulted in very good resolution which I was not able achieve from Wii/BD player.<br /> 4. Got netflix discount of $23.97<br /><br />Conclusion: Is this better than Apple TV? - I do not know and probably it's not. But at this price point and for my needs, this works perfectly well. I only hope (and have seen articles) that more and more apps will be compatible.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy this game.  The first goal, of course, is to solve the puzzle.  The second goal is to do with the minimum number of moves.<br /><br />I do not like that after the first three free hints, you have to pay for more.  Not a big issue, just a little annoying.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|To be fair- I have just watched the first 3 episodes. I somehow felt it was very repetitive and there is nothing exciting really happening in the story..same old same old...money about to come and go, who wants to be whose valet- hope the next few episodes changes my opinion but its been a drag for me.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I've tried several Spider apps for my tablet, and this is the one I like best.  It's fast and the cards move pretty well.  If I don't press consistently while moving cards, they sometimes fall off to a different pile.<br /><br />I wish this app had hints, or at least would tell you when the game is over.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I personally love games that make you use your brain and figure stuff out. This game is challenging,  and really fun for puzzle type get your wheels turning Kinda game. been dissapointed with other games in the app store but I LOVE factory balls! great unique concept Bart Bronte! A+ !
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I downloaded this application based on reviews I'd read, and it works very well.  Interface is simple and effective.  I now have it on my PC, tablet, and phone.
B00CDY6HW6|1.0|my opinion is this: all the 5 star reviews for this game seem like they were written by the same person.  I Hate when developers pay people to write 5 star reviews. Lame! a great game doesn't need fake reviews!
B008M87GJK|5.0|The BBC news is good whatever the medium.  This app has quick, up to date headlines at the very top, and then six categories with nine articles each:  Top Stories, US & Canada, Technology, Features & Analysis, Business, and Science & Environment.<br /><br />An article may appear in more than one category, so if you're interested in just a few categories, you'll still see the top stories.<br /><br />Interface is simple.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Listened to this all week at the beach.  Perfect.  This album will be on my mp3 player for a long time.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|EXCELLDENT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, GREAT ACTORS, GREAT WRITING.  I WISH MORE EPISODES HAD BEEN MADE.  I DIDN'T WATCH THE SERIES WHILE ON TV BUT AFTERWARD THROUGH AMAZON PRIME AND LOVED IT.
B005OK721G|5.0|I have only seen this movie half way twice soooo I decided to order it and, saw it  in it's completion LOVED IT.......thanks
B00124LYHQ|4.0|While I enjoyed the movie, it did seem quite dated.  I had never seen it before, and thought it must be worth seeing, which it was.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Pro.  Fun opuzzles,different levels of compexity.<br />  If you like search and find and touci and combine objects, this is: a great game.<br /><br />Con:  free version so short. Must get full.  Hope it,s longer.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Interesting, Thought provoking, mystery until the very nd. Baldacci does excellent job of keeping his characters interesting, the story moving and intrigue along the way. One you pick up and do not want to put down until you finish.  Camel Club characters are very enjoyable.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Awesome movie came with 2 discs and the digital copy. plus it looks great in 3d. my nephews have the digital copy  for there phones so all n all great purchase and price.
B006ZDU7QI|3.0|Gotye maybe a one hit wonder but enjoy it while you can. I bought this album for one song, Somebody That I Used To Know.
B000LE16VW|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. SERVICE WAS GREAT.THANKS.A MOVIE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD SEE. I LOVE THIS ONE AND PATRICK SWAYZE WAS THE BOMB.
B00AX6KMGS|2.0|Not my type of movie. Alien possession and poor acting left me wanting. Not a movie that I would suggest to others.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|good stories and scripts, dry humor, great actors - unique settings. Every single character is well defined and memorable. Not many SF I have not seen - This is the best series
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Dan Brown could write the toilet paper saga and make in a page turner!  I love his work.  More, more, more.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This is a must have for any gopro. So much easier than syncing with your phone to be able to see what your filming. And the playback capability is priceless.
B0085MK2GM|5.0|I have never heard a pianist play Bach better than Gould.<br /><br />One of the great artists of the twentieth century; he died too young.
B009EEFTMC|2.0|grandchildren downloaded this app to really cant comment  I never was fan of rubik cube but they say it is very fun
0393317552|5.0|once again jared diamond has impressed the heck out of me...an amazing book...I have to write just four more words to get published..there
B00474IVGA|4.0|this cd is great if you are a country music lover you will enjoy the variety of songs on it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book really allows you to relate to the ups and downs of a teenager that is experiencing high school. Throughout the book I felt like I was there. Highly recommended. -Manny
B009KS4XRO|3.0|this game is fun keeps your excitement level up  I do like absolute binge better though try it you might like it
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I bought this cd for just one song, little did I know I would love every trac.  I can listen to this cd all day long, and do.  I hope they produce more great music!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is creative, fun, and thrilling. The writers have made so many people think this could really happen in real life. A definite must see from the beginning.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|You felt like you were in the movie with them.  The story was very good and the scenery and 3D effects were second to none.
1612680011|5.0|This is really a very good book to read to bring you back to the realization of how to use money to your benefit.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|The best 3D effects I've ever seen on a TV.  Plus it was great entertainment. The scenery was drop-dead gorgeous.
B00A9C3RNQ|2.0|I wish I had just rented it and not purchased it because I won't be watching it a second time. I am a senior but this movie is for really old people I guess, because I sure didn't care for it.
1577314808|5.0|Wow, what an amazing book. As you read this book you sense and understand its message deeply. I think you will get the most out of \\"The Power of Now\\" if you are open and ready for it. As the author writes in the introduction, he speaks to your soul, and I think that this is why I found it so effective.<br /><br />As I read the book I could clearly feel many preconceptions I had melting away and my awareness growing page after page. It is a spiritual book but also a book about human psychology. Everything I read rang true and I was able to implement what I read instantly in day-to-day life. I could not only understand myself but also others better. While I have been slowly ridding myself of emotional baggage and preconceptions over the last couple of years, I feel that this book helped me progress much faster. I first read it two months ago, and since then I have noticed that much of the remaining fear and unease I was still feeling gradually being displaced by an increasing sense of lightness and ease. I can identify arising negativity more quickly now and stop it before it progresses which helps keep anger and sadness at bay. And not being a slave of your thoughts and emotions is truly freeing. Together with regular meditation and practice of awareness, this book is changing my life for the better! :)<br /><br />I think that \\"The Power of Now\\" would be useful to anyone who wants to understand and improve themselves. I wish that it were required reading in school and hope that one day schools form a curriculum to educate children how to make the world a better place. I am now getting this book for family and friends... I feel like they should know about the book and hope that they read it soon!
B001P36OY2|5.0|pretty good for a movie I have never heard of.  A good watch if you have nothing else to see.
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|I rember seeing Robert on this tour I was at his very firs concert after Led Zeppeilin in Peoria, IL. It was great brings back some great memories of long ago
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is simply a great read and was hard for me to put down even though it was my 2nd time reading this!
B001EN71CW|5.0|My favorite TV series ever...in HD...on Blu-Ray!<br />If you liked Firefly don't even think twice about buying this.<br />The only complaint I have is that some scenes appeared more grainy in HD than they do on my DVD version (I'm guessing this is due to the HD transfer).
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Read this book as soon as possible. It was lovely and revealing. I am looking forward to reading it again.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|I generally hold Morgan Freeman in high regard.  I find that he can usually get a primary or secondary character shine when acting alongside him.  This didn't hold true for Tom Cruise, nor did the script/story add anything worthwhile to the experience.  I only wish I would've rented before I bought... but it was Morgan Freeman!
0399226907|5.0|My sixteen-month-old son absolutely loves this book! We read it atleast twice per night when winding down for bed. He loves turning the pages with me and \\"reading\\" along. The holes in the board book pages allow his little fingers to explore even more. The book is bright, not too long and holds his attention until the very end, which he's always excited to reach to see the beautiful butterfly. He smiles every time!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I don't know why I love this show so much, but I do. I was disappointed in the ending though. Just don't see why that had to happen, boooooo!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandson (6) absolutely loves this game.  It is for the quick reflex person!  The graphics are very good and the multiple scoring option inspires decision making.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|There is much more going on in The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club, than a group of women meeting in Albert Square to gossip, drink and bitch about their fellow neighbours. Lies, death, cheating, to name just a few. Based in a posh well-to-do neighbourhood, (imagine desperate housewives) these pretentious women all have an agenda and secrets to keep. It's black humour, and I giggled a lot to myself. I have to admit that it took me a while to get into the story, it was a bit repetitive, but I'm glad I persevered. I really thought I had some parts sussed out, but I was wrong. All the little stories within each character cleverly binds everything up to a conclusion I wasn't expecting! A light crime, with some unexpected twists is how I'd best describe this read. Easily left open for a continuation, and I would like to know more! Cleverly written.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|It is a great cast and a good plot line. Bruce Willis is still the man!  You should see this movie if you are over 45.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The old version was much better. The new one is too slow and feels like it was created by a thirteen year old girl.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You either like this series or you don't. I love it and I recommend it if you haven't seen it
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|perfect. in the great tradition of dark 80s sci-fi action, lean story, solid performances, awesome action. couldn't have been more happy with this adaptation.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|It's a good story, well played and has depth. If you like romance with a twist. Watch this.. it's fun
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|For GI JOE fans: **<br />The people giving low star reviews are probably fans of the cartoon who are picky about how things should of been. From a fan's point of view I can see how this movie may be a disappointment for them. It takes a very talented and unique director with an awesome imagination to recreate a story while still staying within the boundaries of seeming believable. I don't think this movie did those action figures or cartoons any justice but it is definitely worth a rent.<br /><br />If not a Fan: ***<br />From a person who is not a fan, who could care less about how this movie compares to anything GI Joe related may appreciate it a bit more. That is if we consider you enjoy a typical action movie like Expendables 2 with cheesy one-liners and explosions. If you enjoy action movies that have to be a bit more believable or movies outside this genre. Then look elsewhere.<br /><br />Better than the first but still needs work:<br />The first movie was terrible because 1. Just about every character looked ridiculous. 2. Had unbearably poor acting. 3. The story and direction was unbelievable or uninteresting.<br />In this movie they must have listened to someone's criticism because they reworked those flaws and tried. I can tell they fixed a lot of it but couldn't resist keeping something from those three flaws. So it is not perfect but at least it was better. I saw it in theaters and enjoyed it so I will probably rent it one more time. I don't think it is worth owning because it may be added to netflix soon along with the other B movies. Save your hard earned money wait to rent first.<br /><br />Overall: Gook or Okay, I recommend, but a rental only.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|What can I say, it's a really good movie with really awesome movie stars. If you haven't seen it. Do it.
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|The movie seemed a bit slow, but character development was an important part of this movie.  Once things got moving, I found it to be lots of fun!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|whether you work outisde the home in a business setting, a work in your home, or are raising daughters -- highly recommend!!
B004LPLU4K|5.0|Very nice story for young and old.  I Would love to see more pictures like it.  Picture quality was excellent.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Furthering an amazing plot with fantastic character development, this is yet another 'worth the time & money' season of Breaking Bad.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My grandson loved this game.  He played it for an entire afternoon, non stop when he first got it on his tablet.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I looked forward to seeing what was going to happen next.  Drawing the reader into the story is what makes a good book.  I enjoyed it.
B001EBWIPE|5.0|This has to definitely be my favorite Katherine Hepburn movie. I love the different characters that are played so well by some classic actors of the time, but to see Hepburn's evolution from a statue to an actual human with basic human understanding is still beautiful to watch
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Not a lot to say other than it does what it is supposed to do and does it well.  I am happy with purchase.
B000I04044|5.0|I love this movie! No matter how old it is, it's still hilarious to watch. It's definitely one of my favorite Hepburn movies
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Yes.  There is sex in the book and a lot of it.  But, the story goes much deeper than sex.  It is a good series when viewed as what it is really about.  I enjoyed it very much.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I am a big fan of Neil Gaiman.  I love his wry satire and his sense of humor as well as the use of magical realism.  Yes, it is short, and yes, it is somewhat predictable.  I like authors who can appeal on  many different levels.  Pick your level and enjoy.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Gerard Butler as the Phantom is surprisingly Great.  After seeing him in so many action movies, who would have guess.  He is outstanding in this Phantom remake.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|The ads would load the stop at 1 at every video. This app is stupid. Vevo please fix this crappy app.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|It kept both the adults and children entertained. It really is a great movie. It's funny & kind of heartwarming
B00847KFDS|4.0|I like what I knew in the CD. I wasn't as dazzled as I thought I'd be and that was a disappointment.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|it's a perplexus...  what else can you say?  sons liked it, played with it then solved it.  occasionally they still play with it but the fun wore off when they solved it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|The book was great...but it ended too soon!  I couldn't put it down, but wish it was longer!  It grabbed my interest from the first page.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is a fun game.  It's tough to put down after you start playing.  I hope they plan to add additional levels.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|it's great and I couldn't stop watching. the stories is great and so does the other things. I will definitely recommend it to my friends.
B00BB22GQM|4.0|Ezra spends a little too much time being gloomy, but this album has lot's of bright spots. &#34;Step&#34;, &#34;Finger Back&#34; and &#34;Worship You&#34; go on my V.W.essentials list.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is the coolest i feel like i am the owner of a real horse everyone should by My Horse.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I first discovered this game for Windows 8...when I saw it was available for my Kindle Fire I had to have it. The only thing I dont like is it takes up a lot of memory space...and I cant get anything else done!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is just like real life uno except u have to pay with chips ( there are different ways to earn including free scratch ticket every 45 mins) I like that you play with real people. There are also things you can use points to buy ( earned while playing) to give you that extra edge. Over all I recommend this
B006I1OB0U|5.0|I recently became a fan of this series following the end of the Season 3.  Because of this, I plowed through all three seasons over the course of approximately one month.  (Yep - binge viewing!)<br /><br />The interesting thing about this special, not unlike the rest of the series, is that the actors do a spectacular job getting the audience to believe that trivial social concerns are truly important.  You will find yourself believing that this, that, or the other social faux pas is just as scandalous as the characters consider them.  This episode is brilliantly acted with the &#34;immersion factor&#34; of a great reality show; except the acting is worthy of the Royal Shakespeare Company.  You end up feeling like your are a member of their family rather than a member of the audience.<br /><br />As an entertainment consumer, the only thing that concerns me is that this episode is already included in the Season 2 blu-ray collection.  I would recommend that you spend the extra $7 and get approximately 8 more episodes from the full Season 2 series.  The only reason that you should purchase this in addition to the entire Season 2 series would be for collector purposes or perhaps this is the only episode that you missed.<br /><br />Without issuing any spoiler warnings, this episode has a splendid ending that will make any Christmas Eve memorable.  This is a more than worthy purchase.  If you have never watched any of the series before, I would caution you that you will be hooked on this drama after only a few minutes of watching.  If you purchase this blu-ray episode, you will wind up buying all 3 seasons.  (That's a good thing.  Welcome to Downton Abbey!)
B00884GR0W|4.0|I think Block story is a really fun game it is almost as epic as minecraft in my opinion. I just don't like how much health simple animals have.
B001FB563E|5.0|This one is simply mesmerizing. Even though it is pretty gory it still has family values and things to admire for those not enamored by the violence.<br /><br />The direction, cinematography, and acting in this film are picture perfect for the material. Violent, decaying, and with a glimmer of hope. Exactly as I pictured it. Again, come here to read the one star reviews on a film like this as they are HILARIOUS. Who are these people? God only knows.<br /><br />The bitrate for the bluray is sky high in the 30Mbps range and the master is clean and detailed. Nothing negative to say here. Should have been awarded with more than it received. An epic tale of hope through the eyes of two survivors.
B009GXHOW4|3.0|I really like this app it's very useful. I just wish they had more like Redstone and minecarts and stuff.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!  Easy to use.  Fast download.  Keeps your interest.  Definitely recommend this game.  A little addicting.  Fun to play
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome read from start to finish. Enjoyed the entire series.<br />Would recommend to everyone. The author is excellent. Can't wait for the movie.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|whats not to like - I saw it when it came out,  copied it on vhs when it was on showtime - but time takes its tole<br />on vhs movies - so had to have a good copy LOL.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I think this is the best book I've read in a really, really long time. It's obviously a story filled with heartbreaking sadness but it is also very interesting discussion into the human mind and heart, resilience, and tenacity.  It is ASTOUNDING that this kind of brutality is actually happening in the here and now.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I really liked the introduction of Thor in this movie. I rated it well because I liked that a lessons about humility vs. pride, and selflessness vs selfishness prevailed.
140006922X|5.0|Very interesting, and you will learn something. Well written and easy to read, I recommend this book to anyone with a passing interest in Jesus Christ.
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|watching this movie in 1080 was awesome ,seen it many years ago but never like this .<br />the twists and turns building to final climax .
B00DURILJ2|4.0|I am a fan of Matthew McConaughey so I went into it with a positive attitude.  This is a coming of age movie that even if you aren't a McConaughey fan, you will probably enjoy it.  No one character, including McConaughey as Mud, really has the screen to themselves to the degree you feel like they are the movie.  Everyone in the movie is great.  Most of the time is with the two boys and Mud.  Mud is a down on his luck man that got into trouble trying to watchout for a woman he loves, played by Reese Wetherspoon.  Now Mud is hiding out because he killed a man.  We find ourselves drawn to him because he isn't a truly bad man, but a man that believes in a lucky shirt and bonfires to ward off evil.  The camera work is good along with the directing, acting, story, scenery, sets, make up, wardrobe, and music.  It is just a nice movie that the whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B000I9YV30 Stand By Me]], [[ASIN:B000ID37RM To Kill a Mockingbird]], and [[ASIN:B000NUXFZO Summer of '42]]<br /><br />CA Luster
B009WUBERW|4.0|actually didn't expect much more than action but Stallone and company did did great job pulling it off and Van Dam was excellent as bad guy.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|This movie brought back so many memories from when I was younger.  The music was excellent and so was the quality
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Highly original plot and setting which makes for a fascinating story.  A little on the dark side.  I got tired of the evil character but was delighted to find he did have a human side after all.
B0081336FO|5.0|I loved it and can't wait for another season!  Make more shows this season as this show is one of the best.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|It is cool but is a little rushed fun though I like it. A little hard without buying things though... I would get it.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Eagles and of course, I love everything they do.  This was not one I had heard of and had to have it.  It has songs which I believe they just wanted to sing and various members of the band sing.  I haven't gotten to the second CD, but again I love anything they do.  I think I could hear Don Henley's voice in a crowd and know it was him because I've listened to so many of their songs.  They were one of the first eight tracks for those of you who know what one is, that I purchased.  All I can say, is if you are an Eagles fan, give it a listen.

B00AWFEBDK|4.0|I have been a fan of Jared Diamond since Guns Germs and Steel and have read most of his books.  Whilst I enjoyed The World Until<br />Yesterday, I found it a little ponderous and sometimes repetitive in regard to previous writings.  However, I have no doubt continue to<br />look forward to any further Jared Diamond books and probably re read the earlier ones.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is an amazing game! I'm a shark lover so I just had to have this game. It's also FREE!!!!!!!! I would recommend this game for anyone who loves sharks and eating tons of things. Plus when you get the Great White Shark a little (or should I say BIG) surprise becomes available! This is a great game!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book. I am not much of a reader  but the first book consumed me so much, I just had to read the second.  I can't wait to get started on the next one.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great puzzle game.  My kids and I like to take turns solving the different rooms.  Hopefully a &quot;sequel&quot; will be made.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was long and boring most of the time.  It was just a strange book, but I continued to read it .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing it's fun and when u first get the game it's like watching the movie for me it's so fun
B0009JM4EC|5.0|This CD is one of my favorites in my collection.  Having seen the Offspring perform live several times, many of their classics are on this compilation disc.  However, during their most recent East Coast summer tour in 2012 they didn't regularly perform Original Prankster, Hit That or Defy You...all of which are on this CD.  This CD in particular provides even a casual Offspring fan a real flavor for their music.  Double thumbs up!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is fun but I have had it for 7months and it does not work all that well anymore anymore mean if I lose internet service it won't let me change to a different place
B004L03B3S|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. It was very interesting from beginning to end.  I wished it had gone longer to see just how the brothers lived their lives but I assume they stayed as a couple.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its fun but the things you have to do to get gru coins some kids can't like some people dont have a facebook
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's crazy fun and is better than most games that are like this combined! It continues to throw new obstacles at you as well.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|A most excellent tale enhanced with narrative transported me to my first journey through the tale by bronte taken over fifty years ago when it piqued my love of the adventure in reading that I treasure still
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I have a family member with dementia problems.  This book helped me to understand what they may be feeling.  This is a very hard problem to deal with.  This book gave me a deeper insight into the problem.  I pray that the researcher will soon have a solution to this disease.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it! It does way more than i expected. Just wish I could play Candy Crush. Very happy with this and all of my Amazon purchases.
B0044CBMVG|4.0|This is a great show if you like crime and mystery shows. There's a little romance here and there :)
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Great great great book ( dictionary) anchored is what I looked for still looking for it loosened your face peanut
B0063B2BNE|5.0|More mystery, romance and science. Bones and Booth grow closer together at work and they are more than friends :)
B00BY7NK96|4.0|Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, has written a book about why she believes women need to be better represented in leadership positions in government and industry and the steps that they might take to improve their chances of doing so.  While she draws on her own experiences - and those of her friends and colleagues - she also cites copious research (personalised for the edition that you are reading, whether it is the US, UK or Australian/NZ edition).  The book is not long, nor difficult to read, and it is guaranteed to get you thinking.<br /><br />Sandberg makes some really interesting points about the ways that men and women are judged differently (by people of both sexes) and that like it or not, women need to understand this and work with it rather than fighting it.  Women can't behave in exactly the same ways that men do and get away with it.  She also talks about mistakes that women make, like avoiding new jobs or responsibilities because they plan to have a family soon.  She makes the point that the time to cut back is after the baby arrives, not before - and that possibly, if the job is satisfying you, you may make different decisions to the ones that you anticipated.<br /><br />This is very much a book that is encouraging women to climb corporate ladders (Sandberg's point being that the more women there are at high levels, the more that all women in the workforce will benefit).  What she doesn't address is the issues that women may face if they don't want their lives to be so career driven.  While she is an advocate for paid parental leave, she talks about taking off weeks (maybe a few months).  Her idea of cutting back is leaving work at 5.30pm but then putting in several more hours later at night.  She takes the attitude that children will always make parents feel guilty for something, so don't worry if they give you grief about not being there.  She also lives in a world where you can take your kids with you on the private plane when you head off on a work trip.<br /><br />Sandberg fully acknowledges her privileged position and she say several times that women who stay home are contributing just as much as those who work (and I believe she means this), but I wish she had explored options for women who want to work part time or take larger periods of time out from the workforce.<br /><br />I found this book really interesting.  In my twenties I was very career driven, advancing quickly through the ranks of a large multi-national organisation.  When my first child was born very prematurely with significant health issues, that changed many of my priorities, and I have never worked full time since.  This book made me think a lot about the choices I made and also some mistakes that I made.  For examples, I remember a job interview (I didn't get the job), and the way that the interviewer interpreted something I said.  I think now that it was a classic case of a woman being judged in a way that a man wouldn't be, and that maybe I should have been wiser about the way I presented myself.  I wish that I had had this book to read 15 years ago.rk trip.<br /><br />Sandberg fully acknowledges her privileged position and she say several times that women who stay home are contributing just as much as those who work (and I believe she means this), but I wish she had explored options for women who want to work part time or take larger periods of time out from the workforce.<br /><br />I found this book really interesting.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is sucha beautiful artist and this cd surely proves that. You will love these songs after you listen to them once or twice....you will be singing right along from the start.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Great series and enjoying all episodes to date. The characters interact well and also hold these positions well. Looking forward to the next season.
B00005ATZT|5.0|i love Harrison Ford and he really does a great job in this movie. I loved it and could watch it over and over again.
B0024YTHFY|5.0|Sad there are a lot fewer episodes but acting is excellent. 'Sams' acting is better in that he isn't as much of 'a girl'.
B00003CXSM|5.0|Jlo and Matthew have outdone themselves in this fabulous love story with a special twist. This movie has to be one of my favories.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|From the first track to the last \\"Rhythm & Blues\\" shows that as Buddy Guy's years increase so does his ability to entrance listeners. With each new album I keep thinking, \\"How is he going to top this?\\" and he's done it again.<br />When I saw that he was coming out with a dual disc I was a little worried having been burned by many rock albums that were stuffed with weak songs and throw away tracks. \\"Rhythm & Blues\\" never lets the quality slip. It forges ahead demanding attention relentlessly.<br />A few of the guest spots left me curious but they work. Having listened to Buddy for years I couldn't comprehend Kid Rock or Keith Urban, (knowing Aerosmith's appreciation for the blues it made sense) but the fit is seamless. Beth Hart just tears it apart and Gary Clark, Jr works it with soul.<br />This is Chicago blues on steroids. The band is tight and fluid, a perfect counterpoint to Buddy's signature playing.<br />From now on when anyone says that the blues is dead, this is the album I'm going to respond with. If there is any downside it's that when the twenty first track ended I was left whining for more.
B000067FP8|4.0|A pretty darn good sequel. A little more scary(?) maybe. But this movie will blow your mind with the endless movie references with the all but lovely gremlins!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Action sequences are just OK.  Inane dialogue really drags it down.  I was looking forward to this, but it's average at best.
6305212112|5.0|this movie has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Kathy Bates is truly a great actress, joined by many others in this must-love comedy. I guarantee you will love this movie if you have a funny bone!
B000VMFDW2|4.0|This is a book that tells about war in the worse way.  I don't mean it is a bad book.  I mean it shows war for what it really is. If anyone believes there is any glamor to war this book will set them straight  It is very vivid about death on the battle field and what it means to look after friends.  There are few books that I know of that  spell out the blood and gore of combat under extreme weather conditions of days on end being in the rain and mud.  It is no wonder the Marines have the motto of &#34;Just a few good men.&#34;  I recommend this book so the reader gets an appreciation of what our service men endure to protect our freedoms.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|This book is very interesting if you are interested in the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the messiah like prophets preceding this apocalypse. But, beyond that it is a strange almost defensive posture in trying to debunk Christ's divinity. It is always pointing to the historical Jesus vs. Jesus. The question that must be asked, if the other messiahs were covering the same time period and leading a revolt against Rome, why did Jesus end up being the one to change the world? If his stories of miracles are just lore, why did they sustain themselves? The part about Pontius Pilate is also very strange, like he was sure that the story of the judgment of Pilate could not have taken place. Really? Were you there? The author also conveniently places Jesus's brother James as only a Jew and not a Christian and at odds with Paul and his move away from the Jewish faith. It also posits that James did not endorse Jesus as god but a Jewish prophet and Paul as a heretic. The book ends abruptly after trashing Paul, or Saul of Taurus. I have mixed feelings about this book, being written by a Muslim, I would love to see his take on Mohammed being visited by Gabriel. In closing, should not be in Christianity section but the MSNBC section on pundit religious belief.
B00DU74U74|4.0|It has a story line which is good.  It is thoughtful and interesting. Enough action to keep you engaged. I liked it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I wanted to see the movie, but never got around to it, and so I bought the book. It was so well written that I couldn't put it down.  At first I was intrigued to learn about the job of a zookeeper. Then it became an adventure story with great characters and situations. Hats off to the author - this one is a winner, one of my favorites of all time.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very good, draws you in. I lost sleep becuase I was so into it. Definitely worth the read, so try it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife watched all 3 seasons in 3 weeks - she loved it and I like it too!  I'd recommend it
B00004S6GL|5.0|This is one of Elliott's best...one of those albums you can listen to from beginning to end without skipping any tracks. And worth listening to on CD, definitely.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|yes i love this charger fast and easy to pack up. Now if i could just keep kids from stealing it i would be good
B000HVHM5S|5.0|V for Vendetta is a great story, reminding us of just why governments should never be trusted with absolute power.<br />The production is excellent. Portman I feel is a little flat in her acting, but that's my opinion. Effects are fantastic.<br />I would really love to see Zach Snyder bring his touch to this story though, he did an amazing job with WATCHMEN.<br />But the Wachovski brothers did a respectable job.
B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|I didn't know she was still recording so I was thrilled when I saw she was releasing a new album. Wonderful album with some unexpectedly delightfully fused melodies. Happy I bought it.
157421327X|5.0|Bought for my art students (all ages).  Good for the younger as well as for the older folks.  The works turn out great - very eye-catching.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I purchase this game for my Granddaughter when she comes to visit.  She really enjoys doing all the hair cut and colors.  Then choosing the accessories and finally taking the pictures. She loves it!!
B005PK57IK|3.0|Unlike earlier seasons, season three takes some liberty with the applicable law in its episodes. Also more of a soap opera feel than legal drama.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  It had compelling characters, and you weren't sure who to trust.  I will read the next in the Robie series.
B004PIA4BI|2.0|I bought this batter for $6.9 on February 21, 2013. It worked until April and did not charge any more. I contacted the seller and they kindly sent a replacement which died on July 21 2013. So if you think it is worth to spend $7 to use a battery for 5 months with an intermittent relay (so about $20 for 1 year), then go for it. Otherwise, this is not a good buy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was generally fine for a free app but at times the solution was too abstract.  I don't know why I would try that.  More hints or less obscure solutions.
B003ITDN86|5.0|Please keep in mind this is just my OPINION so I don't expect everyone to agree with me. And I am not necessarily going to compare this effort with any of SUM 41's other albums or with other artists but base my opinion on this singular effort in and of itself which is OUTSTANDING. I tend to place more emphasis on the music and how it makes me feel rather than on the complexity or meaningfulness of the lyrics (though they are important as well...). This album does a great job of offering a good variety of pop, rock and punk influenced tunes of various tempos. Many of the songs are about heartache and lost love most likely due to Deryck Whibley's divorce from Avril Lavigne shortly before the writing of this record. Maybe also because of this, Deryck's vocals seem more emotional and mature, showcasing a wider range of vocal styles than he has previously. This is one of those rare CDs that I enjoyed almost every track from the first listen and can't seem to stop playing it. Some of my favorite tracks include the title song, What Am I To Say, Happiness Machine and Crash (one of the more beautiful but sad songs I've heard in a while). Hopefully, you will enjoy this as well. CHEERS!
B00847KFDS|5.0|Love Magic Highway.and the the rest of the album. Cool that his sons play with him,have always loved John Fogerty.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|This dvds and cd, are the best used things i ever bought.<br /><br />Perfect conditions, a very especial article for an ac dc s fan.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I will not give a lengthy summary or judge the authors grammar by now most people have heard all of that and I'm not qualified. I will talk about the psychology of the book and that's what kept me interested. I almost stopped reading halfway through because I couldn't believe that a modern woman reading this book would like or encourage a relationship like this with a modern man, good thing it's fiction....right ladies! As I kept reading I enjoyed Ana's defiance and started to understand why Christian needed her to to be defiant. The back story and the struggle is what made me finish and read the rest of the series. There are a lot of steamy scenes....sometimes to much, especially in the second book, but they are hot. I am not a fan of BDSM romance fiction, it's not my cup of tea to each is there own, so I was very glad to see that element of the story be a conflict and not a rule. I think I would have skipped the steamy scenes or quit the book if Ana had completely submitted. All in all I really enjoyed this book and the series it was eye opening to understand why a man (don't want to give any spoilers) may behave a certain way.  A very interesting read....to me. Enjoy!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app gives the weather in a simple to use format and it has proved to be accurate 95% of the time.
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|I didn't like the kind of game it wax.  I like the ones where you have to match things better
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a gift. The recipient was thrilled to receive it. I was impressed with the quality. It is a large hardcover book that would make a great coffee table display item. The information is great too. If you're a Zelda fan you will want this for your collection.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|You have to watch. Only good things to say about this great program. You owe it to your self to watch it or do I O U!
140006922X|4.0|To be honest, I haven't read the book yet, but listening to this man during a 9-minute Fox interview proved him to be intelligent, grounded and rational.  It also enticed me to buy the book.  Maybe it will for you, too.<br /><br />[...]
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a very good book. This author wrote  Kite Runner and his books good. I think these book should be in school so that kids learn about different countries. All my friends like this book.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|very fun game. nice plot and challenging puzzles. suspense is added with creepy pop up. this game is totally worth three dollars
B008P1EWIM|3.0|So far, I have only seen my local weather as it happening.  I haven't experimented with it too much maybe I will find out what all it will do for me.
030758836X|5.0|I'd been looking for a new book, something along the lines of a suspenseful novel. I came across the name Gillian Flynn on my Kindle's shopping list, read a couple reviews. Sure--I'll try this \\"Gone Girl\\".<br /><br />Wow. From the first page, I was hooked. Writing style, upbeat and nifty (I'm old-school, so \\"nifty\\" still works for me). Amy is the perfect plotter, the perfect thinker, the perfect conniver and foil for everything, anything you could imagine. I could not put this down. Funny and tense at the same time. Very different, very needle-like, very tingly...what can I say? Now I have to read Flynn's other books. I've recommended this one to a bunch of friends and family. A real zinger.<br /><br />I have one thought: This writer is so knowledgeable, so incisive, so clever and so conniving, how can her husband (after reading Gone Girl) trust her?<br /><br />Gillian, I know I've read just one of your books, and I will read your other two, but please write another character with Amy's power and wit.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|Catch 22 is as good if not better than I remember it from about 1970. If you're like me, though, you remember it's generality but not its specifics. But it and reacquaint yourself. After all, you, las everyone does, have a share.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Keep you guessing until the very end.  There are lots of turns and twists and you will not see it coming.  Great treatment of history of the time period.  I loved it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Without giving anything away, this is a must read.  The characters draw you in and keep you wanting more.  It's sweet, surprising and delicious.
034580404X|2.0|I have found these books to be very useful in everyday life. Fifty Shades of Grey I use as a door stop. Fifty Shades Darker as a mouse pad. And Fifty Shades Freed works excellently as a fly swatter. Thank you E L James for writing these very useful books.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved the fast pace story packed with action. Some parts were predictable but in a great way!  I hope to see more action out of Clary in the following books though.  (Spoiler) I just hope that Jace turns out not to be Clary's brother. That was kind of a bummer.... if.my prediction is correct her real brother (jonathan) will come into the picture in the future. :)<br />All in all-in-one a great read!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Nice, I like it! Fun to play while waiting. It helps to pass time very quickly.  It's a challenge trying to get to the next level.  I would recommend it to my friends.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I read some reviews that said that they encountered some problems with this game, I played it in my Kindle Fire and didn't  encountered any problem at all. The instructions have to be read thoroughly and have patience with some puzzles. If some puzzle proves to be undecipherable you always have the chace to skip it using an orb. Very good game, I'm waiting for the second.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|It's a shame as it won't work with iPad or iPhones...must be a great app.. And it would be much better if apple accepted it
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is smart, sassy, and funny all in one.  Fast paced and fierce, the characters demand loyalty and will pull you in episode after episode.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Not all that into Twitter, but downloaded to appease a close friend and follow her business. It's ok for an app, not hard to use.
B009MYARIK|2.0|It was a nice summer read but I found it to be quite boring at times.  Not the usual romantic Kinsella.  I loved &#34; Can you keep a secret&#34; and &#34;I've got your number &#34; Sorry only giving this one 2 stars .
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|No frills, basic mahjong game with simple layouts. Not too many options and I was hoping for a storyline, but it's ok.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|It's a fast paced exciting adventure, which is the only reason I made it through this book.<br /><br />However, the premise is very far-fetched especially If you know anything about Irish mythology.<br /><br />I would recommend it to some readers but not to all.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|i love this cleaner  is very good and fast very practical and keep s clean of  cookie s ! good !
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|This is an OK movie with a good story. From all the hype I expected much more drama. Maggie Smith was only fair as she just has that one tip of her head that is suppose to explain so much but it gets old.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|this is a really really really really really fun and exciting game. Everyone should give it a try. ?  So who's next!
B001HC8516|4.0|A lot of the information is useful.  I would say read it and see if it makes sense in your life.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|This is the first app that I launch after rebooting one of our Android devices (Kindle Fire HD, HD 8.9, and Galaxy Note 2).<br />It keeps the running-apps clean.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Great user interface, great graphics, very useful app.  I believe it needs a better user manual or instructions.  I would recommend to others if they are familiar with techy apps and if they have the ability to self-teach.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Now that my wife has this Pinterest app on her Samsung Galaxy Note 2, she cannot stop pin-ning.<br />She's planning our daughter's bday party with many of them.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|it's Florence ATM, what can you say?  Her haunting voice is just awesome.  Wish she toured the Pacific Northwest.  I haven't liked &#34;new&#34; music in a long time; but I just can't get enough of her voice -- it's truly a great sound.
B009A7E7SK|4.0|I like this abs-workout-app.<br />The bonus is that you can download the videos for level 1 for free.<br />Hook-up the Kindle-FIre-HD to a large-screen-HDTV, and you have a workout buddy :-)

B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book I believe is in actuality the truth of life and the way one should live , think and essentially be. I loved it and continue to read it along with other books from the author.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|Good summer reading.  Very entertaining.  .  I recommend it. Really good. Buena lectura de verano.  Entretenida.  Me encanto .  La recomiendo.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I received this book on July 25th. Absolutely love this book.  Dr. Gregory has done it again.  Brings history to life.  A must read.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Re-reading the Millennium Trilogy for the second time.... It's that good! Skip the films, (both the US & Euro versions), you'll just be disappointed and pissed off.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|I picked up the hard bound copy in a regular store. What a great mystery that Baroness James has writen. A must read for any Pride and Prejduce secual.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|A story that stayed with me, as I considered all the &#34;well meaning&#34; decisions we make - without thinking through the consequences and the life-long impact that results.
B000006MS3|5.0|This is a great showcase of her talents. &#34;Suspended in Gaffa&#34; is a peculiar but very enjoyable tune where disjointed lyrics attempt to tackle cosmic questions - like something out of Hunky Dory-era David Bowie. Kate's outstanding voice is used to great affect in the melodramatic &#34;Houdini&#34;. This whole album is worth your time.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I was captured early on and stayed engaged to the end.  This puts our views and understanding of mental health in the spotlight.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|How wonderful to be able to take God's Word worth me wherever I go! Thank you You Version. Than You God!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I had to plug the device into a laptop to set it up using a small setup program from Google.  But, after that...  Simply awesome!<br /><br />The only issue I found so far was that when you try to play certain songs from your phone on Google Music, and the same song is on your phone locally an error about &#34;sideloading is not allowed&#34; comes up and the song will not play.
B0058PJ6NE|5.0|super easy to use, and no hassle to get the movies I am looking for.  there is so many available on youtube
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What a fascinating story.  I wish I new beings like the two women and the girl.  I am going to read more .  Cannot wait.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|not as easy to use, was shopping around for one that is super easy to use and this one seems alittle too complicated
B003VANOFY|1.0|I'd give this 0 stars if it were possible. When it's not randomly shutting off whenever it feels like or producing a high pitched squealing tone through the speakers, sure they work. However it's like flipping a 3 sided coin whenever I use them as to what will happen next.<br /><br />The power button also has a fun little issue of randomly taking so much time before actually turning on. I've had to hold the button in for 3-5 seconds more then once for them to actually register I wanted them on.<br /><br />Stay away from them. Overpriced for the sound quality when they do work and not worth your frustration when they don't.<br /><br />Logitech used to make high quality hardware but lately cut a lot of corners with quality control and quality of hardware then rely on their namebrand in order to make sales. I don't want to say this will be the last Logitech item I ever buy, but until I see reviews and examples showing that, in the future, they have improved quality on all fronts I certainly won't look at their items for any upgrades.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really good characters. Love the interaction between Mike and Harvey. It is a very well written show. Can't wait to see more.
B006S01GH2|5.0|I just love this film. Beautifully acted with a story that makes one believe there is someone for everyone out there!

B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I usually write product reviews.  But this time I wanted to give you my opinion of Oblivion.  Yes, its a Sci Fi Movie, with action and its also a drama.  Of course its got Tom Cruise playing the lead role of Jack.  Tom did a good job in this movie especially the action scenes, the motocross riding, and the confrontation scenes with the Scavs.  I was a little disappointed in his aha moment with Olga Kurylenko playing the role of Julia on the Empire State Building.  I mean really, the only thing he could say about a previous relationship was \\"Thats Impossible\\"  over and over with little emotion?  Hmmmmm.  How would that make you feel?  How about some jumping up and down on Opra's couch!  Ok, that was a little harsh, but the rest of the movie he is flawless.  And how did Morgan Freeman do?  He was good, he played the role of outsmarting his enemy well with a smile, albeit somewhat hidden, but curiously given away in his new found cheek bones bulging with glee.... nearly permanently!  That's not a bad thing because it wasn't over done and quite refreshing actually. There is something that I would call more than determined when a person has a permanent smile - focused perhaps, knowing that you have finally figured out the enemy and can hardly contain yourself.  I was a little mystified of the pairing between Andrea Riseborough playing Victoria who is work partners with Tom Cruise playing the role of Jack.  Ok, she just seemed a little young I guess.  She looks beautiful of course, nearly twenty something yet work partners (who share the same house and bed) with Jack who looks, well at least 50 years old, but yet they seem to be an \\"effective team\\".  But what the heck do Aliens know anyways?  Which brings me to the next point.  The plot.  Yes, it was good and out of the box for sure.  I mean why send your brother aliens to battle when you can send... well, something else.  Doesn't that make more sense anyways?  Its what we do in our world right now.  And how about those special effects?  Truly, how do you get a 4000 square foot home complete with plexiglass bottom Olympic size pool, Airport tower, landing pad, medical bay, a shop to fix drones, and up 2000 to 3000 feet in the air supported on a single needle metal structure?  And have it look so freaking real?  Bravo!.... THATS IMPOSSIBLE!  LOL  5 stars! Or was that 49, 51 or 52 stars?pecial effects?

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I practically overheated my kindle because I could not stop reading this book! Tina Fey writes like she speaks; witty, deep and full of insight
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good book, used often by my 11 year old. All the Wimpy kids books have great story lines and this was not an exception.
B00C2VGAW2|4.0|Not all the songs you're looking for are on here.  That is the one thing that sucks everytime Baz makes a movie, there are multiple soundtracks.
0425263916|5.0|I was reading 50 shades of Grey , I finished that series and now on this series every bit as good if not better hard to put the book down :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|unbelievable, addictive. cast is amazing. costuming and sets, beautiful. can't wait for season 3. I hear there are some surprises ahead
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun i want to play foever and forever its so fun that i want all the subway sufers games
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This game actually held my attention longer than most, I like that it's not timed, hate that feeling of urgency.<br />Imagine working for a toy factory that only makes balls of different colors, accept here you get no pay check at the end of the week.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I love listening to my favorite songs by my favorite artists! The quality is good and its fun to watch music videos. Although, they don't have Lego House, by Ed Sheeran, I still like this app.
1616551607|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband who has been a Final Fantasy fan since childhood. When we got the package this morning, I questioned for a moment whether it was the right package before handing it to him, it was so heavy. I have paid twice as much for \\"fancy\\" coffee table books that do not even compare to the quality, weight, and beauty of this set. When I suggested we could lay out the books on the coffee table, my husband rightfully responded that it would probably break the coffee table(it's from Ikea). They're that heavy. The pages, printing, covers, and even the slip case are of the best quality I have ever seen for something in this price range and beyond. And it goes without saying that the content itself is wonderful. I can't find a more eloquent way to describe the artist's work than to say that it is beautiful.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, if you're even remotely interested, get this set. There's absolutely no way you will regret it. I am not even a Final Fantasy fan, and I was still amazed when we opened the box. This is a perfect gift for any Final Fantasy lover, particularly if they appreciate art. I imagine that this will either sell out or the price will increase in the near future, so get it now while you can. It's an absolute steal.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Cool app really you would love it  I mean I love it my sister loves it and my cousin loves it. This is M.S. and I hope you think my commit was usefull!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a grate game I wish it had more levels you feel bad when you get to level 10 you won't moor just have to wait!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you don't like this game you suck!!! Minecraft has 3 versions PE.  PC. AND X-BOX. BUY THIS!!! IT SHOULD BE MORE THAN SEVEN DOLLARS !!! Do you know Block Story and  Survivalcraft THEY ARE COPIES!!! BUY M.S. TELLS YOU!! Well this was M.S. saying ( BUY MINECRAFT PE) and I hope enjoyed my commit and then you agree and commit back!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|My children and I have played this and other Bart Bonte games for free online at Math Playground (.com) but I am thrilled to have this on my mobile devices! The object of the game is to recreate a sample ball with various paints and tools. It is challenging, especially the later levels and most young children will struggle with it. But it is fantastic (if a little short) for adults, teens and older children. I actually walk through this game with my younger children. There are no other apps that I have found that use this kind of critical thinking and problem solving! Right now there are 44 levels or balls to recreate. I do not know if Bonte Games will release the sequels to this game that already exist online as separate apps or as updates to this one (I'm hoping for updates!) I am thrilled I caught this as a free app of the day but as short as it is I think it is still worth paying for. My absolute favorite Bonte Game is definitely Sugar, Sugar but Factory Balls is a solid second!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love this app!!! It can help you change a dirt block to 255 diamond swords!! Buy it!! After you get the hang of this you should buy PocketInvEditor Pro only difference is that you can spawn mobs... and dye sheep and stuff!! Both are awesome!!! Buy it !!!
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|The cast was stellar, so I had high expectations.  We found the story line a bit weak.  The tension between Maggie Smith's character and her former husband (I think) wasn't developed enough.  It was easy to see the bitterness, but not much foundation built in for why she wanted reconciliation.  Of course, she can make eating dry toast look interesting, so we didn't feel like the film was a total waste of time.  It would have been with less accomplished actors, though.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a great series show and plays in great quality video resolution. Would recommend viewing and streaming service for others. SAMCRO need I say more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We loved this, have seen Season 1 and 2 and eagerly await Season 4, starting in January of 2014.  The characters are so well chosen and interesting it all seems so authentic.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love playing it but don't like when I get the coin counter full and have time to use it, it empties but for the most part really fun
B0013ND30M|5.0|One of my daughter's favorites. Had been looking for this for awhile. So glad to have finally found it and been able to purchase.
1476729719|4.0|It arrived as promised in good condition and my daughter read the first seventeen pages so far.  I only read the intro and comments
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Just pushes coins into the hopper takes a lot of imagination to do that for long. Going to delete it from my Kindle.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|kindof hard at times but gives you a sense of accomplishment when you figure it out. this app should be free everyday, not just today. it's not long enough or challenging enough. make it 100+ levels, then we'll talk. good app to get during free app of the day though.
B00CFNUMD0|4.0|I found Shaun quite the babysitter for my 3 year old grandson.  He will watch the same shows over and over which is fine with me considering the options.<br />Personally, I would recommend the show to anyone who has children.  There is one draw back to the show that I found most interesting and that is I find myself watching it with him and enjoying it as well.
1609611543|5.0|I stopped eating wheat before I found this book. The book explained a lot of what I personally experienced. I highly recommend it.
0810988933|5.0|It was for my cousin, he said it was in good conditions, read it the same day that i gave it to him.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|lack luster action scenes - this is the only thing you are seeing it for isn't it? don't see it at all. boring and simple plot.  2 stars cuz its still bruce willis its better that the most recent GI Joe he was in.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you are a Dr. Who fan then this will continue to be a great show!  I LOVE the fact that it is available on my Kindle and for free!!! Wouldn't be able to see it otherwise.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I loved this book and is totally in my top 10 favorite book list along with the Harry potter books!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|When at boathouse under door dead people.<br />Robert are you Lady mom Dragon top ten Tour<br />Ahhh!scary hip hop y el mundo con mas de la historia
B0054R6BFM|5.0|sure, summer reading kinda sucks. but in all honesty, I really lik this book. It focuses on the struggles of a.young teen girl who people don't relize is struggling. Hannah killed herslf, and left a \\"suicide note\\" on 13 audiotapes of why. this book was amazing an has chanhed the way i see other peo. in my opinion it should be one of those books inschool that you are mandate.to read like to kill a mockingbird or here th red fern grows. it opens up you eye to the emotions and affects you pose on other peoples lives. the only setback i had with this was it was a very tough read. Reason being it switched betwee perspectives so frequently. i recommend this book for ages 14-17. if you dont read it, just kno that you're missing out.
B00CDY6HW6|1.0|I give the game a one star because half way through Bunny village it force closed. tried uninstalling the app and downloading again. now app won't open at all.<br /><br />the game play was good... bunnies were adorable. but the one star will remain until bugs are fixed.<br /><br />little disappointed :(
B00000JNJ1|5.0|i bought this collection of the faces because it was supposed to be this classic rock n roll band and had that great line up (including ronnie lane). i am a big fan of mick taylor and don't particularly take to his successor's work with the stones. but what i wasn't prepared for was that tasty guitar work which is ever present in the band's music. i was amazed at ron wood's bluesy/warm and lazy guitar licks which provide an able foil to stewarts vocals. highly recommended.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|We enjoyed this DVD the time on the boat with the tiger were our favorite parts and also the scenerys
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just want to watch more and more.. I will be so sad when I am through season 3....Can't wait for season 4
B008YWY0HK|4.0|We enjoyed this DVD it was a surprise to us and we enjoyed the ending we enjoyed the animations in this movie.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Every time I watch it I can't help but laugh out loud! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a laugh.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|We were surprised at the violence in this DVD it was too much for us as we are from way back we both are in our 80's
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|For what I believe is the 6th attempt to put F. Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby on the screen, director Baz Luhrmann's adaption brings the novel to life in a novel way. Many will love the razz pizzazz of Baz-Jazz and hate the 1920's soap opera-like scenes. Others will appreciate the reverent tone of Fitzgerald's novel, especially the words narrated by the writer's surrogate, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and hate the loud, gaudy yet contemporary party scenes. For me the film is balanced pretty well.<br /><br />Jay Gatsby (terrific Leonardo DiCaprio) is a self-made millionaire, living in semi-seclusion in a huge mansion directly across the bay from Tom (Joel Edgerton) and Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) in New York's Long Island. While Gatsby is most often alone, he deals with his mysterious businesses by phone. He also throws elaborate parties almost every night. Hundreds of guests come in all their colorful finery and party all night long with bootlegged booze endlessly on tap. Gatsby's next door neighbor is Nick who is renting an old caretaker's cottage. Nick is also a cousin to Daisy.<br /><br />After Nick and Gatsby become acquainted, a meeting is set-up between Gatsby and an unsuspecting Daisy. Five years earlier Gatsby, then an officer about to go to war, met Daisy at her parents Louisville home. They fell in love but the war kept them apart long enough for Daisy to marry Tom, the heir to an industrial fortune. As they say, old money. Tom, a brutish chauvinist is romancing Myrtle (Isla Fisher) on the side. Myrtle is the wife of George (Jason Clarke), the owner of a broken down gas station between Long Island and the city.<br /><br />In the big party scenes, Luhrmann reminds of his \\"Moulin Rouge\\" with many shots down from the ceiling, spinning cameras and twirling dancers. \\"Gatsby\\" has one of the best soundtracks of the year, coordinated by executive producer, Jay-Z. The filmmakers do a great job mixing some older music, mostly Gershwin classics, with modern rock and hip-hop. It all works.<br /><br />The film falls a bit short of perfection however. And by short I mean long. That is, the film runs nearly 2 ½ hours. This might have been OK if it meant longer or more musical opportunities. Instead, the last act crawls along until the obvious conclusion. Unlike Robert Redford and Mia Farrow in the 1974 underwhelming version, DiCaprio and Mulligan have a real connection giving their characters a believable portrayal of love lost, found and lost again. I suspect Fitzgerald would have liked this version.<br /><br />(BLU RAY UPDATE 12/30/13)<br /><br />I thought the movie seen for the first time was worthy of 4/5 stars, primarily for the production values.  I watched it again, this time on a Blu ray disc that comes in a couple different packages.  I've added 1/2 a star.  Before I get into the Blu ray qualities, allow a supplement to my original review.<br /><br />The film received mixed reviews at best, some scathing.  While I will admit to Lurhmann devotion to Fitzgerald's novel is shallow, I don't think he was trying to make a dramatic commentary of the illusion of the American Dream.  He was trying to entertain with big sets, big color, big music and an overall big production.  While not a musical in the traditional sense, Lurhmann and his music producers (Craig Armstrong and Shawn \\"Jay Z\\" Carter) manage to create a stew that portends the era with vintage and modern music beautifully mixed.  You will hear shadings of Gershwin's \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" throughout the film.  The movie opens with Jay Z's 100$ Bill and closes with Armstrong's \\"The Green Light\\" with properly layered modern songs in between.  The music adds a richness to the film, from intimate moments to the wild parties.<br /><br />Lurhmann does effectively maintain the love triangle created by Fitzgerald and incorporates his dialog, sometimes with the words floating above the screen (effective in 3D).  My favorites include Nick, after meeting Jordan (Daisy's pro golfer best friend), recollecting \\"She frightened me but I enjoyed looking at her.\\" And Jordan telling Nick about how Daisy met Gatsby in Louisville, \\"The way he looked at her was the way all girls want to be looked at.\\"<br /><br />I loved the art deco sets, The Jazz Age (Fitzgerald coined term) feel, the exotic clothes and the overall amplification of the time.<br /><br />As for the Blu ray version.  It is as exotic and spectacular as the film.  Properly transferred in 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, it looks great.  In an over-the-top production like this the color must pop and it does.  The film is purposely bright and the lighting often provides overly sharp images, especially skin tones.  This should be expected.  The blacks are inky dark.  If you look closely at some of the scenes with night skies, you might see a speck or too but no big deal.  Overall I thought the video was sharp with excellent delineation.<br /><br />Likewise the audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Other than wishing it was 7.1, I have no complaints.  Again with the music a major contributor to the movie, it has to resonate.  And it does.  Surrounds are active most of the time, especially in the party sequences.  The subs will get a workout as the Duisenberg's big engine roars.  And some of the more lively songs produce plenty of thump.  Here are the extras, most of which I found fascinating:<br /><br />*The Greatness of Gatsby (HD, 9 minutes)<br />*\\"Within and Without\\" with Tobey Maguire (HD, 9 minutes)<br />*The Swinging Sounds of Gatsby (HD, 12 minutes)<br />*Gatsby Revealed (HD, 30 minutes)<br />*The Jazz Age (HD, 16 minutes)<br />*Razzle Dazzle: The Fashion of the '20s (HD, 16 minutes)<br />*Fitzgerald's Visual Poetry (HD, 7 minutes)<br />*Deleted Scenes (HD, 14 minutes)<br />*1926 Trailer - The Great Gatsby  (HD, 1 minute)st friend), recollecting \\"She frightened me but I enjoyed looking at her.\\" And Jordan telling Nick about how Daisy met Gatsby in Louisville, \\"The way he looked at her was the way all girls want to be looked at.\\"<br /><br />I loved the art deco sets, The Jazz Age (Fitzgerald coined term) feel, the exotic clothes and the overall amplification of the time.<br /><br />As for the Blu ray version.

B001KWTBVQ|5.0|We just love our copy we watched it the day it came. It had no commercials to wait through we had seen this movie many times on the TV
B000V39KDO|5.0|Picture quality is excellent. Fantastic movie and superb acting by Butler.would definitely reccomend this blue ray print.Its visual effects justify blue ray purchase.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Hell of a script.  Reminded me of Mamet's Glengary Glenross.<br /><br />The Hollywood ending gave me some heartburn as no one I know of has been cured of bipolar through dancing.  Gotta take your meds big guy.<br /><br />Great acting by the leads, actually a strong cast throughout the film.
B00AAU7AI0|1.0|This book was such a dissapointment and totaly different to what I thought it was going to be.  I really thought it would be an interesting adventure story and not a deep philosophical diatribe that when on and on............  Very boring and a total waste of my money is all I can say.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game keeps you on your toes.  It is a very fun game and my 6yr old grandson thank it great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an easy going game for me to share with my son, bonus: it's a mess free pet. :~}
B008F5YDRI|4.0|THis was a nice movie.  Nice story.  Was alittle slow, but a nice satruday night date movie sitting at home.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Good movie.  I liked it a lot and would watch again i time.  Check it out if you have not yet done so!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Awesome graphics. Loved the puzzles even though quite a few of them were really simple. I would definitely play the sequel if they make one.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is amazing I love it. I love how every floor gets more tricky than the one before this game is for people who love games that are hard and who love games that strategy.
0780619951|5.0|This movie, though older, is still one of my favorites. I love the characters and the story, and I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it. The only thing that bothered me about the film is the way they portray Dr. Moreau. Though it is still a wonderful film, and although the extra footage did not add many minutes to the movie, I still greatly enjoyed seeing something I hadn't when first watching it years ago.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Big Bang is super funny.  I love how different all the character are, but they still come together for the best ensemble cast on tv.  :D
B0000669JL|5.0|We went to Emerald Isle, NC for a long weekend and stayed on the sound side in a big, beautiful waterfront home and played this CD almost all weekend so had to have it for myself when we came home - it's going to the beach with us again soon!
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|There were so many great players in this movie, but I think it could have been a little funnier. Still enjoyable though. :-)
1452113432|4.0|This is a very beautiful cookbook with well-written instructions. I am a vegetarian knowing full well that there would be recipes centered around meat and seafood. There are still quite a few recipes suitable for vegetarians, however most of those recipes contain a lot of eggs and cream. Being a novice to French cuisine, I had an inkling the food would be rich. I just didn't realize it was THAT rich. That's not an insult to the cookbook author, it's just a general observation of French cuisine. With that being said, I still like the cookbook. Her instructions for poaching an egg are spot on. Her quiche recipe is simple and perfect. My husband and I both think her quiche recipe is the best we've ever tasted, better than Tartine's deep dish complicated quiche recipe. I've also made her beet and goat cheese salad, and her savory goat cheese and pistachio &#34;cake&#34;. I'm not saying every recipe that didn't contain meat, poultry or seafood were souffles or quiches. There's a wonderful vegetable soup recipe, a recipe for lentils and beets, the root salad is lovely, among a few others. I gave this cookbook four stars because I was hoping for a few more vegetarian recipes that weren't centered around eggs and cream. Knowing all of this, I would still buy this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you like Facebook... having it on your Kindle is wonderful! Nicer than my phone because the picture is bigger and clearer. What more can I say?
B003G4W49C|3.0|This book is too far out for me.<br />I like science fiction but this is<br />a bit too much for me. I try to follow<br />and understand the story and after half<br />the book I couldn't read it anymore.<br />I am not sure what other readers like<br />so much about it but what can I say.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Ten levels of fun, why are there not more.  I finished the game in less than a day and it left me wanting more.  Hurry with more levels!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I still remember the first time I saw this in theaters, it blew my mind, I spent the whole night lost in my head. Since then I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and loved it more every time. I can't even describe exactly what it is that I love so much... the premise of the film is awesome, the soundtrack is excellent, the emotion and how the music really pulls you into it is great and there are just so many small details that you notice on the 2nd or 4th time watching it that make it even better. Excellent film all around, if you haven't seen it yet then buy this, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This was wonderful for my grandson to put his legos in and carry with him.  It's a great way that he can keep his favorite toys with him and keep them safely together.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I used this on an old launch PS3 probably two years back to try and help with an overheating problem. It definitely helped and the machine ran much smoother than before I reapplied the thermal paste, the stuff Sony used was pretty bad. The PS3 still gave up a few months later but I this did help extend the life of the machine a bit.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Great movie, gotta love the overbearing mother :) recommended for all ages, our older kids were entertained with this movie.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Final Fantasy VII is where I spent many of the hours of my youth, and even as recently as a year ago I finished a play through. It was the first game where the story reached out and pulled my in (the first time I played it I played for nearly 3 days straight, ah the good old days) and I spent hours (more than 100 on one run through!) discovering every little part of that world. I first saw this movie in probably 2008 at a friends place and ended up getting the collectors edition for Christmas that year. The complete edition is much better than the regular version, you get a full story, hi definition, and I spent a whole day pouring through the extras. The animation is great, even stands up well to much of the newer animation in 2013, and the soundtrack is a good listen on it's own. The plot isn't revolutionary but if you've played Final Fantasy VII it'll make a bit more sense. Getting to see all of the character come back together filled me with a strong sense of nostalgia, especially during the fight scene with Bahamut. It's one of those movies where you get that tingly &#34;this is fricken amazing&#34; feeling and the music certainly helps to pull you into the action a bit. There are some parts that will make some people roll their eyes but this is based on a game so it isn't meant to be strictly realistic. But this is a movie made for that fans, and in that this movie does great! Beating Final Fantasy VII was a great achievement but I always felt that the whole story wasn't really told or ended. Advent Children serves to end the story for good, and does it well. Overall, if you were a casual fan of Final Fantasy VII you will probably like this movie, but if you played multiple play-throughs or spent hours exploring the story and world of VII then you will love this movie.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I didn't rate it as a Oscar candidate, just as a guy's fun, get even, kick but movie.  As such,, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Had some funny lines in; references to other action hero movies.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|you know from the first chapter where this book is going, but the suspense comes from I waiting for the other shoe to drop.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I wasn't expecting this book to be so good. Quite a page turner! Can't wait to read the rest if the trilogy!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Years ago, I lived my life following my inner voice. Little by little, I stopped believing it was guiding me, and I began looking to others for answers (the inner guidance felt schizofrenic). Something deadened with that change and since then, I have picked up numerous books hoping to find something that would prove that voice exists, and that the clear, familiar guidance was real. This is the book. Thank you Pam, for laying out clear, easy to prove tests that are undeniable to my own experience. Your book is funny an wise and just what I needed to regain the magic and meaning in my life. May this book guide many beings to a life of adventure and discovery!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|If you like Tina Fey then you will enjoy this book. It made me laugh just as she does on TV.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|Grew up with ZZ Top and always loved their music. Especially Brown Sugar. Waiting on the Bus and Sharp Dressed Man.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Best game ev e r. I can not stop playing it. It just like a so amazing. If you game the game you wont stop playing it believe me....
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|What can be said of this century's greatest tenors? For a classical trained voice to be able to cross-over to popular music and do fantastic renditions of today's music is extraordinary.<br /><br />A gifted voice could only come from Heaven.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|freaking awesome the only thing missing is a campaign that would make it even more awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but the original is still alright.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for her birthday, loved the books, movies and even got a chance to go to Universal Studios to see the Harry Potter attraction.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I  have  seen  all  of  the  Die  Hard movie's. I. BELIEVE  THIS ONE  IS THE  BEST SO FAR .  EVEN  THOUGH THIS ONE  SHOWS  BRUCE  WILLIS  AS  OLDER  IT  MAKES IT  MORE  REALISTIC.
6302763835|5.0|Great movie. Would like to find other movies like this from that time period. Would like to see more, excellent.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|An interesting take on class warfare. The story was engaging. The visuals were both beautiful and gritty. The acting and the soundtrack were pretty good. All in all very entertaining.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Temple Run app was very fun to play. Just as the previous Temple Run app, this game has a person running from creatures after coming out of a temple and trying to prevent the character from dying or falling. This app, however, has some new unlockables that the original Temple Run has like characters and abilities. I would highly recommend this app for any gaming fan or anyone who liked the original Temple Run.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|bought it for the song &#34;Hold On&#34;, and love the entire album! Glad to hear American Idol audiences picking winners!
B001AQT11M|5.0|a childhood classic. wonderful to see after watching it on VHS for many years. it is wonderful that this Grimm fairytale will be remembered after so many years.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|The BluRay and a sequel can't come fast enough. This is a movie with glorious giant robots, laughs, legitimately frightening monsters, and great effects. While watching it, it seems as if it were created just for me, since as a boy, I grew up dreaming of giant robots like these. The humor and human element keep the whole thing moving along nicely. I've seen it multiple times, and I don't understand why it hasn't performed better at the box office. Hopefully the final foreign releases and DVD/DB sales demonstrate the need for a sequel!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Only complaint is that I have more than one Yahoo related email account and couldn't find a way to set them both up on this app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|if you think you want to make, bake, copy, or find something new or cre8tive everything you ever wanted<br />is right here awesome app i could be here a while ;^)<br />see ya later
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love this game.  It's hard to stop playing it!<br />We've had to reload it once because it locked up, but since we did it has worked great.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|Exactly what I expected.  Great sound, music flows well.  I would and have recommended this CD and other 2stepsfromHell CDs to my friends.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|cd case had a scratch across the front, but the cd inside was perfect and very affordable. id recommend this
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is a procedural puzzle game; you are shown a result and must figure out what steps to take, in what order, to achieve the same result. This type of puzzle is excellent for building several types of reasoning skills that are both useful in real life and largely neglected by most non-edutainment games. I also happen to personally love them, so I am always happy to see a new title in this genre that isn't aimed solely at young children.<br /><br />This one is definitely for older kids and adults. There is nothing family-unfriendly here, but the puzzles, especially the later ones, would probably be frustrating for young children. If a kid is old enough to cook unsupervised, they can probably handle this game just fine.<br /><br />The game play is smooth and forgiving, and includes a Zoom In feature so that those of us on small screens can get a better look at the sample we are trying to match. While it is possible on some levels to ruin a ball, those levels come equipped with a recycling can to allow you to start over.<br /><br />The mechanics are more varied than many other games of this genre, including some creative ways to modify the shape of the ball (the plungers were a surprise to me) and plants in addition to paint as surface effects.  The wide range of masking tools is also quite a nice feature, although I do wish some of the more exotic ones were used more often.<br /><br />Overall, quite a solid contribution to the genre. I would give the trite \\"my only complaint is that there wasn't more\\", but I chew through games of this type at what I am told is an outrageous speed, so I will simply warn fellow aficionados that you will probably be done with this game in an hour or two if you are not careful. Happily, the designer has several sequels offered as Web games. See you there!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great acting, interesting story line, and good humor. Highly recommended. My wife and I just began Season 2 and its also very good.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Proof that somethings only get better with age!  It's nice to see a band go there own ways, but still stay together and show how much they've grown apart as well as together.
0811877485|5.0|These are so awesome. can't wait to put them up in my grandsons playroom.  Good quality and seems easy to apply.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|It was a awesome movie and the book helps fill you in on what the characters are thinking.  I love the book as much as I love the movie and hate when I get to the last page!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great characters with a good mix of humor in with the story. We would recommend this show! Some scenes are not appropriate for young children.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was really hooked while reading this book.  I did not want to put it down. I ordered the next one and started reading that one already. I am enjoying that one too.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I really love this film, its definitely my favourite of all Robin Hood films I've seen.<br />It is from a different perspective and has more mature characters which I think is appropriate due to the primary aspects of the tale.<br /><br />The story line, costumes, settings and above all, the character portrayals by excellent actors are all sublime.  Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett fit well together and their characters' progression from cordial formality to love is believeable and magnetic.  The uniqueness and nuances of theirs and the other characters make them multi-dimensional rather than cookie-cutter copies of the basics of the legendary tale.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I am so addicted to this game.  Best game I have played in a long time.  Just start and don't want to quit on it.  Anyone looking for a good game, try this.  You will love it.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|Though all the performances in this comedy are top notch and funny, I really think Charlie Day makes the movie.  His character is simultaneously inept and brilliant and he carries it off so seemlessly.<br /><br />There are many moments that are pure slapstick and others that are a bit more nuanced comedy.<br /><br />Colin Farrell - an actor of amazing capabilities (see &#34;Triage&#34;) does a great job of being a disgusting, unappealing pig which is somewhat unsettling as he's anything but.  However, it suits his role well.<br /><br />The movie is appealling in premise alone.  How many people like their jobs and their bosses ?  Very few I think if the truth be told.  These are normal (ish) guys out to make their futures tolerable without much of a clue as to how to go about it.  Their learning curve and the pitfalls along the way are painful and humorous.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some parts were a bit on the juvenile side which probably wouldn't be enought to bother a lot of people, but to me, they detract just a bit from the parts that are not.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|First, this is a cover album being sung by Vince Gill.  He is not Merle or Buck and not pretending to be.  In a review I read, he says the songs have already been done by the masters themselves and this is not an attempt to try to do that again.  Instead, Vince has a more gentle voice that gives these songs a different, but still excellent rendition. The instrumental is great. These songs are true honky tonk sounds.  They are sing along and tap your feet songs.  Nothing commercial or phony here. If you like real country sounds, you have two true country musicians, Vince and Paul, plus the backup musicians, giving you exactly that. They've covered some great songs and have done them with just enough difference from the originals to make them Vince and Paul songs on this album, sung in tribute to those two masters that did them first. Nothing wrong with that!<br /><br />Sample The Bottle Let Me Down.  If that ain't a \\"honky tonking\\" two stepper, then I don't know what is!!! Hot Damn!!!<br /><br />I just listened to Together Again....again.  I swear I get chills listening to Vince's vocal and Paul's steel.many of the cuts, and the instrumental is pure country wonderful.  For me, that disk alone is worth the package price.  But, you get an additional 3 disks also, each one great, and each emphasizing different musical character .  I can't believe I let Vince, with all his vocal, song writing, and instrumental talents slip past me for this long.  I'm on board now and intend to stay there.  Sorry for ramblings.  But if you like Bakersfield, I feel like I owe other country traditionalists this heads up.  Thanks.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I always like the Orson Welles version of this tale, but, to me, this one beats that by a mile.  With Michael Fassbender, Dame Judi Dench and relatively unknown Mia Wasikowska as parts of an excellent cast, this telling of the story is much more nuanced and the personal connections much more believeable and powerful though quite softer and smoother in their unfolding.<br />There is an immediate connection between Rochester and Jane though they may not see it as quickly as we do.  The delivery of lines completely natural and non-affected.<br />The other aspects of the film - costumes, scenery, scene setting etc. are impeccable.<br />I would urge anyone with the least bit of appetite for Charlotte Bronte or similar authors to make a point to see this beautiful film.
0440241901|5.0|Hands down, I loved this book! This is the first Sophie Kinsella book that I've read and I was thoroughly impressed. I haven't read many novels by British authors; the British slang and phrases made me laugh and kept the book refreshing.<br /><br />Emma is a twenty-something marketing assistant who exposes all her dirty (and random) secrets to a mystery man on an airplane and that man (Jack) turns up in her life constantly throughout the rest of the book, constantly reminding her of her secrets in clever ways. Emma's two roommates, Lissy and Jemima (two words: maple syrup), make frequent appearances as well with their own side stories about love. Although I liked Lissy better as a character, and mostly disliked Jemima, Jemima's mother's \\"advice\\" about how to catch a man made me laugh. I loved how Kinsella was able to keep the book light and comical, rather than overly serious. I've read a lot of books leaning more on the serious side lately so this was a nice change. That's not to say there wasn't serious subject-matter in the book, but Kinsella incorporated it in a light-hearted way- much appreciated! Some of the book is predictable but not overly so; I did not see Jack's \\"big secret\\" coming one bit. Based on this novel, I'd definitely read more Sophie Kinsella novels. I enjoy her writing style and want to pick up the Confessions of a Shopaholic series as well. 5 stars most definitely!
B000M341RI|5.0|Love it !!!<br />Its wonderfully funny with touching parts as well.<br />Men who have become statistics of the environment of corporate greed, look for ways to survive - each in their own ways - and keep body and mind together.<br />How they so innocently slip into their solution is subtle yet very humorous.<br />Watching them perfect their new-found talents is hilarious.<br />It may seem somewhat understated but it is only a dry sense of humour for the most part as there are real issues being dealt with in a jocular fashion here.<br />A friend said she had difficulty with the accent, but I did not.  There may be a term or so with which one might not be familiar, but within the context of the story, they can be figured out (or Googled).  To those familiar with the Sheffield accent, there may be some disconnect in that the accents may not be spot on, but to most everyone else, that would most likely not be noticeable in the least.<br />Only a few of the actors will be familiar to an American audience, but that should not detract from enjoyment of the piece as they all do an excellent, effortless job in their portrayals.<br />It shows what people can learn to and be willing to do to make ends meet, but in a harmless, humorous way.  There is no backstreet gang activity etc. here.  Its just all very grand fun and touching.
0061537969|4.0|I recently picked this book up at my local book store because of all the good things I've heard. I enjoy books about animals and I thought a book about a dog's perspective was even cooler. I liked Garth Stein's writing style enough, but maybe not my absolute favorite.<br /><br />I found Enzo, Denny's dog, to be extremely endearing. I really felt for him when he ached so much to be able to express his thoughts and feelings to his owner and other family members. The relationship between Enzo and Denny was awesome and it makes me appreciative for my dog even more. What I didn't know before picking the book up was that Enzo and Denny both enjoyed racing; Denny was a pro race car driver and Enzo and him watched numerous races on the tv. This struck a cord with me because my brother and dad both enjoy racing on the track together and my dad loves to watch F1 races on tv. The beginning of the novel was a little slow, but the last 150 pages or so really turned it around, which is why I gave it 4 stars. The ending was great and there were plenty of shockers in the novels that I wasn't expecting. I'd definitely recommend it!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|The disc was new and worked great. No distortion or freeze. It is a great way to watch series that you have missed. No advertisements!!!!!
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|It was a pretty quick read, but kept me interested throughout the book. Not a classic to read repeatedly, but definitely an intriguing story. A bit sad, but still very enjoyable.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This move is raw sex raw emotion and most of all raw truth. It is the beautiful and dark that we all truly have in our lives. If you can not find one person to relate to in this movie you are dead. If full of passion of all kinds struggles of the heart
1421550644|5.0|I bought the Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind Box Set on Amazon when it became available again. My books arrived quickly with no damage, despite being a heavy item. The set includes 2 large volumes that contain the entire Nausicaä saga written by Miyazaki, along with a great little 2 sided poster with Miyazaki's art. All is contained within a sturdy and beautiful slipcase. Fans of Miyazaki's work will not be disappointed. The story is excellent. Fans of the movie version will be delighted by the depth and scope of storytelling, as well as the beauty of Miyazaki's drawing. The movie covered several of the plot points, but only a small part of Nausicaä's tale. This set is one of the best manga collections I've ever read. It's magnificent!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this story. It kept you reading. I could not put it down. I would recommend it to everyone.  The writer new how to keep you on the edge  all the time
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|My wife thought the movie was boring. I thought it was just so - so. But, Tommy Lee Jones saved the day. The part played by Tommy kept us watching it to the end.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Outstanding History story. The background from the Germans perspective is the most interesting. This story shows what can happen to a country lead by a minority of madman. Good read.
B00CXQL828|5.0|When I first sampled this at Amazon, I didn't give it the time of day. Then, after REALLY giving it a shot on Spotify some time later, I HAD to purchase the CD.<br /><br />One of the best albums in the Genre. Yes - EVER.<br /><br />I'm familiar with Portnoy's work, and a little in touch with Sheehan's work, and didn't know Kotzen really at all. This release makes me glad that Portnoy is no longer in Dream Theater - none of his other work has made me think this. I hope he never gets invited back, and The Winery Dogs keep on putting out killer releases like this.<br /><br />Sheehan makes me want to pick up my bass full time. Luckily, Kotzen reminds me why I sing and play guitar - even if I can't sing as pretty as he can (or play even close to what he can do).<br /><br />It's been on constant rotation on my MP3 player and in my car's CD player. I've been bitten.... (get it - Winery Dogs?!)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Didn't care for all the porn in it, but I loved the story line. It kept me wanting to read more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the moral undertow as well as the love story. Hoping there is a second book so the story can continue!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of the best movies i ever seen, i now know why everyone love this movie after watching it. This is a movie you must see in your lifetime.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|I can't get the chimp to jump so can't even get started.  I took it to a friend who plays games like this.  He showed me how to get into the game but he couldn't get the chimp to jump either.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show still.  This time the shows build off the other to leave you hanging or you need to catch up.  Still exciting to watch and witty.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Ashlan has written a very interesting book on the historical Jesus and the evolution of the Christian faith.  Many of his conclusion confirm what I have discovered through my own research.  I was intending to write a book called \\"Jesus and the Roswell Incident\\" to expose the similarities of how innocuous events can take on new meaning based on revisionist perspectives long after the event by those advancing their own agendas and self importance. I do not believe he in any way diminishes Jesus' importance as a man nor his message.  He is simply clarifying what Jesus real message was for it's intended audience, fellow Jews of his time.  I doubt Jesus even liked gentiles and certainly wasn't trying to save their souls and make way for them into the Kingdom of Heaven.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's something different than normal court drama.  It's good this season as each show is it's own for  the most part so you aren't left hanging or lost if you just watch one show.
1608871827|5.0|Chock full of incredible background text and illustrations. If you love Kaiju and Giant robots... I highly recommend this! Highly!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I couldn't even install the game let alone play. Even once I managed to get it installed it pretty much killed my kindle fire HD. Even after resetting back to factory my kindle still doesn't work like it used to. Avoid until they get this fixed!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Even if you aren't a big mob movie fan, you have to appreciate a well made movie.  Top to bottom this movie was just well done.  It's not the &#34;Godfather&#34; but it is pretty darn close.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|When this first came out I absolutely hated it! But as my Phantom appreciation has grown I actually really enjoyed it. Good cast. Not the best lip syncing but it definitely sounded good. :) happy to have it in my collection.
0743454537|4.0|This is a story on a difficult topic. As almost always, Picoult drafts the characters pretty well and with a good amount of detail and while I did have trouble relating to some (specifically Sara, the mother), I felt I knew all the characters well enough to follow the story.<br /><br />The story keeps you going, it is exciting and I read through the book in less than two days. Unfortunately, I have to agree with others, the ending is disappointing. While I have no trouble with a surprising twist and while this is something that is present in all of the Picoult books I've read so far, in this case here, the ending, in a strange way, makes a mockery of the very topic that kept me sitting on the edge of my seat for 450 pages.<br /><br />That is not to say you shouldn't bother reading this. As said, the topic is interesting and controversial, the characters and storyline are well written and easy to follow despite, as usual, the alternate writing from the viewpoints of several characters and overall it is a really good book.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This version is absolutely amazing! Perfect cast. Can't get much better than Ramin, Sierra, and Hadley all in the same show. :) Absolutely brilliant. And to top it off there are great guest appearances to make for an epic conclusion. Totally recomend for even the non-Phantom lover.
B000PATZQK|5.0|Saw these guys live this summer, knew the band but not this album. It sounds exactly like you would expect something with this cover to sound. Very 1967. Great, beginning to end.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|We have simulated hardwood floors, laminated, and a dog and it is great for minor dusting and vacuuming.  I'm sure you could spend much more for an appliance that might do a better job, but for the money, tough to beat.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I downloaded a sample of the Kindle edition just to check it out bc it had great reviews and I was immediately drawn in and needed to purchase the full edition. Couldn't put it down and finished the story in 2 days.
B00005JLEU|4.0|the movie itself was in good condition just the box was cracked at the bottom and sometimes the movie freezes but still I LOVE THIS MOVIE
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a really good book and I like how it's realated about a kid my age thanks Jeff kenny
B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|This Movie Is Suppose To Be The Third One In The Series How Ever It Is More Like A Movie Bye Its Self. I Thought The Movie Was Really Good Maybe It Should Have Been Partly The First One But Great Film And It Has The Real Ip Man's Son In The Film As Well He's Nasty At Martial Arts Just Like His Father Great Film All Around Especially The Blind Fight Scene And All The Others. Recommend This Film o All Who Enjoyed the first two Ip man films I feel you won't Be Disappointed In My opion I now I Was Happy with My Purchases.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A powerful enlightenment for women, young and not so young. A book that I hope many men will read as well. This must be a societal goal; a goal from which we will all benefit. Extremely well written and well documented. I will recommend it to my daughters, my son, my husband, and all those I know in leadership positions.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Ok so sure, it isn't the real thing, but is the best on Amazon! If you want it scary put fog on and put it at night. You can barely see anything, it's fun! So stop hating people! It's good!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This is a great app.I highly recommend it to all Kindle Fire HD owners :-) Incredibly easy to use as well.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Now I have super smarts because of this dictionary and so each that it gives.I live this so so much
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I have had this game awhile and I love it BUT recently the fame would not load telling me there was no Internet connection even when I do.  I am frustrated because I can not find a way to fix it and I can't play it because it won't open.  If this problem gets fixed I would give it 5 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Am still learning how to do it it is moving to fast for me so am having trouble with it
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Even worse than the original.  I was hoping for more scares, less gore I guess.  Oh well... If you love excessive gore you'll probably enjoy it.  Just wasn't for me.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was awesome! I loved it. It is addicting and so hard to put down. It is really a good read.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|I am probably one of the biggest Joe fan's!! I await the day each new CD hits the store! As with all the previous records, this was TOTALLY worth the wait!! Sexy, smoothe and sensual as ever!!!  TRUE R&B at its BEST!!! Very few cd's you can put in, push play and relax!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM!!!!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game. It's not necessary to buy anything, but you can if you're not patient. Graphics and music are GREAT. The only complaint I have is there isn't enough room for many decorations. Unless you want less habitats. Plus I would like directions on the rules for getting and receiving gold. So 4 stars.
B001NLL93W|5.0|A wonderful world you want to get lost in and never return! Hoping for more stories to come. Can't wait!
B000003C5C|5.0|As I don’t have listened to this CD, when launched.<br />I come to love Death when they sold &#34; Individual Thought Patterns&#34; in Japan.<br />That struck my heart.<br /><br />And their early days’(Scream Bloody Gore and this one) CD’s are also great.<br />I miss Chuck.  R.I.P<br /><br />I love the song “Leprosy” best.  I always headbang just before the guitar solo.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|A wonderful world you want to get lost in and never return! Hoping for more stories to come. Can't wait!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Paul is soooo Funny, in lots of different ways.  I watched it over and over again, laughing out loud each time.  There are so many scenes that are so well played for the comedic value, it smoothly flows through the plot.  All the main characters are well played.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A wonderful world you want to get lost in and never return! Hoping for more stories to come. Can't wait!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|not what i expected.  I would have liked more information or a better presentation.  i did not get what i expected to get from this book, and i think it just makes the other books about the subject more desirable
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie is a must see.  Very inspirational.  Good to watch with the entire family.  Very important lessons to be learned.
B003XURDAY|5.0|Blade runner has an interesting story--that's becoming more relevant every day(google Ray Kurtzweil's &#34;singularity&#34;)--and beautiful<br />cinematography. I will say though that the tempo is a bit slow for modern audiences.
B00BIKCYAU|4.0|All as advertised, wonderful to have both blu-ray and dvd options<br /><br />If you are a collector of this series, you should get it!
B00947N6D8|5.0|I really hesitated buying this movie. I am an animation junkie and my children follow my lead.  But, I found it a little difficult to understand the premise. That is, until we rented it. My young daughter fell in love with Sandy.  My son was riveted by Jack.  I thought the group of characters was richly drawn, especially for a movie aimed at a young audience.  There are so many discussions that can be had with your children--faith, love, anger, friendship, dreams.  The final scenes were even a bit more emotional than I expected. It has become a major favorite in our house. Keep in mind there are some rather dark scenes, but I do believe they are handled well overall.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Our family became serial serial watchers! This was an entertaining series; we watched one after the other. It was great being able to obtain full seasons on tape.
B006LSZECO|5.0|WOW,  STARTS OFF A LITTLE BORING BUT IT'S LEADING UP TO EVERYTHING.  JUMPS FROM CHARECTERS TO DIFFERENT DATES.  KEEP UP WITH IT.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|When I was recommended this book by a wonderful publisher (Gold Wind Ltd) I felt rather sceptical that such a thing could happen. But it seems it did!There's no doubt that John Locke's self-published books are at the top of lots of lists! Now that I've read it twice I think I'm going to try and put his twitter, blog, email etc ideas into practice. At the very least it gives us struggling lesser scribblers hope!<br /><br />NB When he says he does not give out advice directly about your blogs etc he means it. Sorry about that John should have read it properly first time!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|CAN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN--WILL DEFINETLY BE DOWNLOADING THE OTHER TWO! ONCE YOU BEGIN READING THIS BOOK, THE SUSPENCE KEEPS YOU GOING AND GOING UNTIL YOU REACH THE END.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you enjoy testing your reflexes then this a great little game to lose some time to. Plus who could resist minions?
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I am having trouble with this game loading 95% of the time! When it does load it is a fairly good game.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Downtown Abbey is wonderful, of course.<br /><br />I wish subtitles had been available. They are available through Netflix, but not Amazon streaming, (as far as I can tell).
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|I thought they did a great job of adapting the book...I read the book and thought that it would be almost impossible to make into a movie. Props to them.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|Scatter-shot though it is, ranks up there with Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, Faulkner's The sound and Fury and and Big chunks of James Joyce--all the same &#34;writer showing off&#34; genre.  But the payoff is you're in the presence of an intelligence playing with and smithing words about what it's like to be human.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|I liked the movie and it was pretty entertaining, it was just very obvious what was going to happen at the end.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|My two grandkids love to play this game on my tablet.  I haven't played it myself, but they both really like it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One-billion out of One-billion. This game is the BEST SANDBOX BUILDING GAME EVER cause I've known minecraft for about 1 3/4 to 2 years. I love this game. This game is boss.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Both grandkids - ages 9 and 6 - love this game.  They play it every time they are at our house.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best games I've ever seen - can't wait for the next Room!!<br />As others have said, it's a little too short (but that in itself is praise too!).
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book had the best combat sequences I have ever read.  I almost came down with PTSD just from reading it.  Sanderson really captured the fast paced terrifiing nature of combat.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie. It was really well done, from the characters, scenery, and especially the actors.<br />I can't wait for the next movie!
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|I love the show and am happy to recieve Season 3 via Amazon Instant Video, but I have yet to get through an entire episode without it failing and losing connection.
B001UG56ES|5.0|I ordered this film as a friend was over and had not seen it. I am so glad I did as it had been quite some time since I saw it and really enjoyed it a second time. Would highly recommend.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Would highly recommend this game to anyone who has a kindle fire hd.  The graphics are great and love how you have a choice on the way you can control your buggy.
1490313370|1.0|All of the review quotations from James Altucher's book &#34;Chose Yourself&#34; seemed weird to me, yet all the reviewers said they loved the book and got a lot out of it.  As soon as I started reading it myslef, I realized why.  Mr. Altucher begins with the assumption that his readers have been primed to fail.  They have been told over and over by parents, teachers, etc, that they are no good, not good enough, worthless, etc.  And therefore their self esteem is so low that they can't succeed in the world.<br /><br />If this description fits, then perhaps Mr. Altucher's book will be very helpful to you.  But my parents raised me to believe in myself and succeed!  I do, and I have.  So this book is of no use to me.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It's really super fun and addicting for about the first 2 weeks you play. But. After a couple times of playing you re play a bunch of the words and its really annoying
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|There are a number of iterations on many of the songs so unless you are a die-hard fan of the Allman brothers, it may be a bit of overload, but for those interested, it gives you a glimpse in their creative process.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is very good for traveling and can keep you up to date freinds and relatives locations as well. thanks
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This show epitomizes what happens in a post alien invasion and how the human spirit and ferocity of it  keeps us in the fight. The odds are wildly  lopsided and sheer will and the need to survive are shown in every episode.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|It is easy to get around in and hasbeen helpful in many searches, really good for BBC. thank you very much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids, age 2-6, all love this game. Good choice for our family.  Hours of clean fun and entertainment. Thanks
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is an absolutely fun game. I love playing it. Its very addicting. It does have some flaws as with any game, but they do a good job of fixing them. I also love how they always are adding something new and keeping it interesting. FUN!!!!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|The Harry Hole series has been definitely engrossing, especially if you like murder mystery thrillers.  Detective Hole tends to always find the murderer but what mystery novel doesn't? The European perspective that this writer has makes for a great read.  I have read all his books in the series.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|It is not a bad movie but it is not a good movie either.  I would not go out of my way to recommend for people to see it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great series, hard to put down once you start.  I devoured al three books in the series and was excited to watch the movie when it came out.  Definitely a great read for those Fiction lovers out there.
B003477DVK|5.0|It's a fun, light, humorous & wonderful family movie. It's being based on a true story made it even more interesting.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|But just didn't knock my socks off. Not ground breaking at all. After such a long time away from recording I guess I was expecting too much.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This is a great book I would strongly recommend it for anyone looking to build a startup. Excellent ideas for creating a flexible robust startup.
B00APKIN1I|4.0|I am happy to have it in my collection but the songs are not knockouts at all. A few are totally uninspiring but a few are good. I could have not got this and be just fine too. The seller was stellar though. I would use them again.
B001KX50BK|5.0|I've always loved the movie and it was great to watch it via Blu-ray. The quality was great and this item comes at a great price.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|Pros: This unit can scan mounted slides, B&W negs, or color negs.  It's fast and easy to use...I am able to scan a roll of 36 negatives in about 15 minutes.  I love the standalone feature, freeing me from the computer.<br /><br />Cons; To scan strips of negatives, the film must slide through a plastic film holder which gets scratched quickly.  Mine was horribly scratched after only scanning two rolls of film.  Of course, the scratches are easily visible in the image.  I bought some spares through Amazon, but will only use them for my most important images.  Also, the optical quality of the plastic strip holder is not high and can result in uneven lighting.  (FYI: You don't use the film holders when scanning mounted slides.).  Another complaint of mine is that the 10Mb resolution is interpolated, not true, so your image resolution isn't as good as you might expect.<br /><br />Bottom line: It does a fair job on slides, if you aren't concerned with true 10Mb resolution. Can't recommend it for scanning film strips.  Does not give anything close to professional results.
8866135909|5.0|I've always been a fan of Moleskine products.  I like this planner because it's the perfect size (not too big and not too small) for a planner. It allows a lot of space to write out whatever plans you have as well as any notes you may need to make.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Yes, everyone was right. This movie is amazing! All the reviews are dead on... I love it. Its not your typical cheesy love story, it's REAL. I appreciate that!
1607066017|5.0|This is a great comic book series, especially when it comes to creativity and humor. The humor is more of a dark or crass humor, so if you don't like that it may not be fore you.
0131103709|5.0|Husband recently began programming again in \\"C\\". Something that he hasn't done in years.<br />He bought several recommended books (this one and C the 8051) to help ease back into<br />something he had forgot more than he remembered. These books have been very helpful and<br />made the tasks less painful for him after all these years.
B001DHXT20|5.0|The title says it all! It's the Hulk as he should be! Marvel totally erased the memory of the first debacle and deservingly so! The best scene, at least to me is definitely the field scene! You'll see! Also they picked the perfect actor for the part of David Banner too. Just a good all around take. You won't be disappointed and if you are...well...put your young pants on for two seconds will ya'!? LoL
B007MDB71O|5.0|I caught this first time on sky anytime not expecting much having not heard about it. Was amazed at how good it was after watching straight away looking for a sequel. Fingers crossed Disney pulls through!
0307454568|5.0|What a giant mind was lost when Larrson died.  The germ of this trilogy was Stieg's life experience, and it is clear that he had a lot more to say (Lizbeth Salander's story was not finished).  Maybe there were notes or outlines for the the next chapters and a writer will flesh them out someday.  I hope so.  I also learned a lot about Sweden, the good of which shows through even though Larrsen's story heavily involves the dark side.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Interesting but predictable.....I read it through without skipping pages - which is unusual for me.  Very light read.  Slightly better than average.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it a lot! I am pretty good at it but I am having trouble with level 10. I recommend this app!! you should get it!!!!!!!
B004GUSG4M|2.0|This book starts fairly interesting then completely loses itself in the center. Just becomes a maybe, maybe scenario that does or does not exist. It truly loses the reader in its lack of suspicion and forced drama. Then it wraps up in the end proving that if you love lifetime channel movies, you'll love this book. But if you don't care for them, or like stories that are ninety percent grounded in reality and the ten percent that might as well happen in space as they have gigantic plot holes, you won't care for this book.<br /><br />I thought about my review. In all honesty since I'm a writer I try to be nice to others, but honestly I had to trudge through this. I started reading another book since and am flying through it. Indicating my disinterested. Again if you like hokey stories and lifetime drek, then hey this is you my friends. But I don't go for stories where things don't add up. So it went from 3 stars to 2. I read it, but in the end, I didn't learn anything I wasn't entertained beyond a simple... huh. And whenever I explained it to my girlfriend it was me complaining about how much I don't like it but I am pushing through valiantly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|wow what a great game it was very adicting and I don't want to put it down! get the app it is very good!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you enjoy playing bingo on your computer, phone or tablet, this is a great app. It's one of the better ones out there, in my opinion. There is the occasional glitch, which are pretty few and far between & I play daily. Aside from having to wait a little longer for updates, it works great on my Kindle--much better than other apps like Bingo Bash & Bingo Blingo.
0425266060|4.0|I have read the first book so far and am starting the second book.  To me, it seemed as if the first novel was the end of the story and then you would begin another novel.  It was not a smooth transition.  In comparing the two authors, 50 shades was softer, more romantic and even though it was D/M with sex, it was sex with love whereas Crossfire was more &#34;raunchy, graphic, explicit sex writing.  It's good but I enjoyed 50 Shades better as it was more of a love story than the Sylvia Day book.<br /><br />Also, you would have to know the sequence of the books in case you put them down out of the box as it was not labeled Book 1, Book 2 Book 3, as did the 50 Shades books.

B00821OX98|5.0|What can I say ... I am hooked! I have gone through the first two seasons in a  week. At the end of the day when I watch tv this is all I watch. Cant wait to start on season 3!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I don't have a lot of time, but I do want to say it's a VERY enthralling read. I have taken longer to read this than I originally wanted (I managed to plow through the first book in about three days, but it's been more like three weeks with this one, due to unforseen circumstances), but it's quite the roller-coaster ride.<br /><br />I really can't wait to get into the third one.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I can't wait for the next part of this story.  Great characters.  Kept me interested throughout the tale, with plenty of twists and turns.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|i enjoyed this prequel to the Wizard of Oz. Visually is was wonderful- the costumes and special effects. As this is based on the book more than the original movie it was interesting to follow the story. I will watch it again!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|filthy not my type of reading, never read it thru ...it was pornographic and would not recommend it to anyone
125000098X|5.0|The Clifton Chronicles were wonderful.  Three of the best novels my husband and I have ever read.<br />We are anxiously awaiting to see if Jeffrey Archer is writing a fourth novel.  &#34;Best Kept Secret&#34;  has<br />to have a sequel--<br />Thanks for asking<br />maggie
B0070Y46UY|4.0|My least favorite part of this now cinematic novel is the first 60 pages in which the promise of the cover and of the synopsis are hardly foreshadowed. Instead of a story about a boy on a boat with a tiger, we're getting a story about a young zoologist who's attempting to fill his future work calendar with religious holidays (being a practicing member of three major religions). But after reading it a second time, I realized that the book wouldn't have come off without the first 60 pages, without getting a sense of the stricture of this young boy's life and the tools with which his family and environment equipped him in order to survive his eventually harrowing tale. The ultimate effect at the book's conclusion would not have had the impact it did if not for this as well.
B0036OS3EW|4.0|I live in Cleveland, Ohio and these boots are awesome for all the snow we get!! I love love them!!
B008PZZR5K|5.0|Wonderful moving movie. The special effects and the beautiful scenery added to the movie. We really enjoyed the plot (Will not give it away)...Just watch it and you will also love this movie.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I used to be a Showtime subscriber, but dropped my subscription a few years ago.  Then, of course, the Showtime series &#34;Homeland&#34; made it's debut and I heard what a great series it was!  Just my luck.  As soon as this First Season DVD became available I ordered it from Amazon and I was not disappointed...it IS a great series and I cannot wait for Season Two to come out.  In fact, I have pre-ordered Season Two so I can catch up with the plot as soon as possible.  The series is produced by the same people who created &#34;24&#34; on Fox and it is of the same high quality production and writing standards as that show, another of my favorite series.  I doubt that I will renew my Showtime subscription, but as long as it airs &#34;Homeland&#34; I will buy the season DVDs.
B0000024YL|5.0|I had the album of this same cd but no longer have  a record player.  It is a great album.  Thank you
B00008GKEG|5.0|To tell the truth, as much of a Beatles fan as I am I have only seen the Beatles Anthology twice:  Once when it was originally aired on TV and again after I bought the Anthology on VHS tapes.  The VHS collection has been sitting in my closet for years, unwatched, not because I don't have a VCR (I still do) but because it was &#34;out of sight and out of mind&#34;.  Now that I have decided to replace this masterpiece collection with DVDs, however, I feel the need to watch the Fab Four sing &#34;Strawberry Fields&#34; and &#34;I Am the Walrus&#34; on screen again.  This is a well-produce anthology that covers the band's rise and fall with great clarity, and I recommend it to '60s enthusiasts everywhere.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is the best app/game I've got.  I thought my jigsaw puzzle putting together days  was over. Thanks so very much for this. I purchase more as they come available, along with the free ones.  I have gotten some wonderful comments when I share my completed puzzles on Facebook.  Keep them coming please!<br /><br />EDIT:8/03/2013<br />Since getting my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 device and FINALLY getting all the bundled puzzles I'd already purchased on this fancy device, this game over heats my device, shuts it off in the middle of game play and freezes up.  Now, I'm baffled.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  Hosseini writes beautiful books with a story that keeps you wanting more and more.<br />A must read.
0785153942|5.0|The perfect companion to the movie. I read it after I had seen the movie once. I recommend reading it before watching the movie if possible. I really think that it will make my next viewing experience all the much better. This graphic novel really helps you to understand some of the relationships shared between some of the main characters. It also explains a bit more of the back story & the creation of the Jaeger program. My only regret is that it wasn't 3 or 4 times bigger. I can't get enough of this world that Guillermo Del Toro & Travis Beacham have created.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it so much, we watched all three seasons, twice!  Anxious to see season number four. . .'hope Matthew didn't die!
0380973634|5.0|The book was perfect - it looked just like my old copy that got destroyed, and was exactly as decried. It came quickly, just in time for me to have it signed by Neil Gaiman himself during his last signing tour.
0553801503|5.0|Expectations were without a doubt going to be high coming off of what many people (including myself) considered to be the best novel in the series: A Storm of Swords.  Perhaps the expectations were impossibly high.  Too high for any author to meet, including George Martin.  With some of the decisions that Martin had to make for this book to come out at all, there was likely to be some vocal backlash from certain fans.  (In an attempt to not regurgitate a summary of A Feast for Crows, which many of people have already done.  I will focus on how the novel compares to previous books, and try and quell reader's fears.)<br /><br />The problem proved to be what most people predicted at the end of A Storm of Swords: the series got too damn big.  Although there are many fantasy series out there with more books in them.  I mean look at Robert Jordan, his novels have managed to span fourteen volumes, not including the prequel novel, and a companion book.  I'm pretty certain that he is in large part the reason for deforestation.  Not to mention the likes of Piers Anthony (whom I am very fond of) and select other authors who don't seem to understand the word \\"ending\\".  However, unlike many other fantasy authors that seem to fill half of the novels with mere bloating tactics, while their ongoing plot arches are paper-thin and miles wide.  Martin develops A Song of Ice and Fire, with a scope that is unmatched by any author.  If you want depth, you're looking at the Mariana trench of fantasy sagas.  It is safe to say that A Song of Ice and Fire didn't just raise fantasy's literary bar, it became the standard for which everyone else must try and match.<br /><br />With A Feast for Crows, Martin found himself faced with the insurmountable odds of tying in characters and story lines, which after half a decade of buildup, ended up with him cutting it in half.  The unfinished storylines and their characters were simply held off until the next book in the series, A Dance with Dragons.  Feast's length is closer to that of A Game of Thrones than Storm, which might make some people disappointed after such a long wait.  But I think it was a better choice for the story - or to put it more aptly, this installment of the story.  Considering that Feast was originally supposed to be two times longer, its most impressive quality is that it flows so smoothly together, and how concise the narrative remains.<br /><br />As the story opens, the reader is introduced with a flurry of new characters (a necessary device, considering that most of the characters from the first three novels are now dead), some minor characters are now prominent figures, and several chapters that detail the relative calm across the land following the calamity of war.  The best part, for me anyways, is that some of the new point of view characters recap key plots that may have slipped many readers' minds over the series.<br /><br />Some readers might be disappointed that we don't see much of the bloody and violent action of previous volumes in Feast.  There is a lot of exposition, as Martin has to bring us up speed on not only characters we remember, but also on the new ones he's introducing.  Martin obviously has a skill for worldcraft with compelling storytelling that remains virtually unchallenged in fantasy, but it also comes with, what many consider a down side.  Many of the characters have lengthy discussions of politics, both present and historical.  Like I said, many people believe this to be the worst part of the book.  However, I felt that it was the most interesting.  There is something to be said for the level of painstaking detail of history that Martin placed into his novel.<br /><br />If A Feast for Crows is only a transitional volume in this gigantic saga, it is still a story told with as much passion and humanity as Martin has brought to any previous volume. And it adds much detail and texture to an already rich and layered world. The choices of what to cut and what to hold back obviously were not easy ones, considering the book's long and frustrating gestation. But readers who have managed to avoid building up unrealistic expectations will find that Martin has brought his story to a necessary, believable, and appropriate pass. In the aftermath of catastrophic war, in the endless, vain and violent quest for power and more power, no matter whose banners are flying at the end of the day, there are no real winners. Except the crows.<br /><br />Five Stars<br /><br />P.S. I know that many people have written about how you could skip the Cersei chapters. DO NOT DO SO!!! You would be doing yourself a great disservice.  She is without a doubt the most interesting character in this particular novel.ld back obviously were not easy ones, considering the book's long and frustrating gestation.

B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Candy Crush is a great game to play, but having to wait for more lives  anywhere from one minute to 24 hours is annoying. People should just be able to play the game continually with no wait times.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It was one of the most amazing series I have ever viewed.<br />I was completely absorbed in  every scene, fascinated by England's dynasty. I hope a sequel is on its way soon. If there is another series like this one please let me know as I would love to watch it. Again<br />thanks for having this series available. I was saddened however with the ending. Truly !<br />However every good thing must come to an end, or so I have heard.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Mike did his homework. I have read my share of fitness books and they seem to fall into two categories. Someone telling you that they are an expert and you should blindly do what they say, and buy all of their products lest you miss out on vital information that could save your life. The other category is more rare and that is the author who actually cites sources and admits there are several modalities that may work. Mike falls into this latter category. On some of the information I was skeptical on, I went to his sources page and look up the reference to make up my own mind.<br /><br />While this book has a fairly simple workout program, it is straightforward and effective, probably because it focuses on the powerlifts as the key exercises and works in the 'strength building' range of 4-6 reps. Definitely if you are new to weights (or are these dopes in the weightrooms that do nothing but curls, you know who you are) this is a good book to buy. I personally found his other sections more edifying than the workout section, but that is what most people buy books for.<br /><br />In addition to this book, Mike's women's version (the name eludes me, but the title is similar) is very informative for the woman looking to up her fitness game. He also has an informative website, muscleforlife.com that you can check out his writing style and get some free info.

These books are great especially for younger readers i'm 15 now and still love them i had all of the series in paperback but a few of them were destroyed, so i plan on getting this hardcover series so i am able to re read the series as i get older and maybe give them to my kids to read :)

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was lucky enough to have ordered this just before they cancelled their Netflix deal so basically I got this dongle for about $11 (subtracting the price of the free 3-month Netflix subscription) and for this price, the device is definitely worth it(and even for $35)!<br /><br />What I think of it so far:<br />I got it in the mail yesterday and havent used it too much yet but I did try out the basic features like playing YouTube and Netflix through the Cast and switching apps and even locking my iPhone and everything still plays on my TV. Adding YouTube videos to the TV queue is helpful too when I have some friends over. Casting tabs from my laptop is simple and effective. It is in its beta stages so it's a bit laggy sometimes but it works.<br /><br />What features they need to add:<br />-I do think, though, they should add a password for being able to control the video from other devices as it might lead to friends trolling you and interrupting your video halfway through, etc.<br />-I also think there should be an easier way to get back to the original video that is playing on the TV if I switch apps or browse to other videos within the same app because it is a hassle going back to it to control it.<br />-I like casting a tab but its annoying if I want to go to another tab I have to stop casting the one it was before and start casting the new tab. There may be a way around this already but I don't know of it yet.<br />-The obvious is that they need to add support for more apps to Cast to as Netflix and Youtube are essentially the only main ones so far.<br />-And since google decided to let iOS devices into it, I think they should also add the ability to stream content I have purchased on iTunes as that would definitely stack up against the Apple TV.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this product and if you were one to purchase it early then you got an even better deal! I hope this helped some customers into deciding whether or not they want to buy it. Tried tomake it medium length since I know long reviews scare some people away :-)
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is a great read for extroverts and introverts alike.  It's provided me with some interesting data that I've put to practical use.  More than anything, there's a lot of content talking about how much we live in an extrovert's world, so it actually made me a little depressed in places, but all the more reason to read it and recommend it to your extrovert friends; maybe if they see how difficult it can be to adapt, they'll start trying to be more introvert-conscious.

0062255657|5.0|I REALLY loved this book (even though his shorter stories often leave me frustrated).  It has a lot of the fun and simplicity of his children's stories, but meant for grown-up-sized people.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|In an effort to include more classics in my selections, I began reading Oscar Wilde this year. My first two choices An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest introduced me to Wilde's clever wit and biting commentary on social London. So when I began this story, I expected much of the same.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I realized that this story is on the opposite end of the spectrum from some of Wilde's lighter works.<br /><br />Dorian Gray, a handsome young man who is a bit narcisstic and vain, serves as muse and idol for artist Basil Hallward. When Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotten, meets Gray, he is intrigued by the young man who has captured Hallward's devotion. Gray, for his part, becomes enthralled with Wotten's hedonistic view. When Hallward creates his best work yet - a breathtaking portrait of Gray that seems to perfectly capture the young man's beauty and youth - Dorian wistfully wishes he could remain forever young and let the painting age instead of him.<br /><br />As Gray becomes more enamored of Lord Henry's views, his life begins to change, but his physical appearance does not, and thus, we realize his wish has somehow been granted. As Gray's debauchery reaches new lows, the young man's physical appearance remains untouched; however, the portait shows every sin the man commits.<br /><br />To say this book was not all what I was expecting would be an understatement. It was dark, wicked and oftentimes perverse. But that's not to say I didn't enjoy Wilde's story and the moral lessons he tucked within the pages. Gray serves as a warning to all that a wicked life cannot go unpunished. But more importantly, Dorian Gray is a potent reminder that a beautiful exterior can easily mask a poisonous interior.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought it for my boyfriend because the one he had previously suddenly broke for no reason. We have been using it for a few weeks and it works great. No complaints at all about this product. It was worth buying it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast's world is turned upside down when his wife, Helen, thought to be long dead, suddenly reappears - very much alive; however only moments after being reunited with her, she is kidnapped and Pendergast must race across the country and against time to save her. But Helen's kidnapping is only the opening move of an intricate plot that includes a serial killer loose in New York City whose agenda seems directly tied to the agent and the discovery of a long-hidden sect of Nazi soldiers in Brazil, intent on rebuilding the Third Reich and completing its World War II mission of global domination.<br /><br />As he struggles to find answers in these increasingly complex cases, Pendergast soon discovers Helen kept many things hidden from her - revelations that will change his life forever.<br /><br />Two Graves is a fast-paced story that does an excellent job balancing the several plots woven throughout the pages. Long-time readers will be excited to see the return of Corrie Swanson, and the authors finally bring closure to the reasons behind Constance Greene's incarceration at Mount Mercy Hospital for the Criminally Insane. All the familiar favorites return for this globe-trotting adventure, including a few who haven't been seen in quite some time, and new faces are introduced - two in particular who will directly influence Pendergast's future adventures.<br /><br />As always, the reader is suspected to suspend disbelief at Pendergast's remarkable abilities - some bordering on the supernatural - but all in all, this was a terrific book that long-time readers will find satisfaction in as they join their favorite FBI agent on another remarkable adventure.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|In a sad dilapidated trailer park in the middle of nowhere, poor Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) dreams of bigger and better things but, unfortunately, he has responsibilities as the de facto handyman to all and sundry.  His claim to fame comes when he sets the record on an arcade game called Starfighter.  Every old fart in the trailer park turns out to cheer him on.  His life has peaked.  This is as good as it gets.  No college loan forthcoming, no town in sight, just a handful of pals, and a tag-along girlfriend.  Thank goodness an intergalactic snake-oil salesman (Robert Preston) shows up to conscript him into a battle against the Ko-Dan Empire.  Why muck about with a game when you can do the real thing.<br />Along with Tron, The Last Starfighter has the distinction of being among the first few movies to utilize CGI for their special effects.  Today, of course the industry has far surpassed their accomplishments, making their technique look cartoonish by comparison.  Still, it does look fabulous on Blu-ray (I didn't hesitate to upgrade from the Collector's Edition put out in 1999).<br />The story isn't complicated.  The only outstanding performances are by two old pros, Dan O'Herlihy as Grig and Robert Preston (Centauri) in his last film role.  Everything else is par for the course.  It's amiable, laced with a lot of \\"gosh-golly\\" enthusiasm to make it sweet and silly.<br />A sentimental favorite that I enjoy watching often.<br />Favorite scene, the gloating BIG head hologram (was that Xur or sewer?).
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I'd not ever seen the movie for this book - although I will now - and although I'd heard much good about it, I'd never read it. I finally picked it up when Neil Gaiman tweeted that it was on sale as an e-book for .99. I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />The fantastical world Jones created is incredible! Although I knew early on who would end up with whom, it never once detracted from the magical story. Jones' universes - for there are four in this story, five if you count the castle - are imaginative and complex. She artfully weaves several storylines into one all-encompassing plot, and in doing so, makes you eager to turn the next page to see what happens. I read this in one setting, because it was that good!<br /><br />I love the lessons it teaches, too. Even as adult, they're ones worth remembering.<br /><br />If you like fantasty and haven't read this book, go pick it up right now! There are two more in the series, and I plan on getting them soon.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This movie was exciting and great. I really enjoyed it! I highly recommend it! Lots of adventure and actioned packed.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Bossypants is a humorous and candid window into Tina Fey's rise as a comedy writer. Self-deprecating and honest, the book touches on everything from her start at the YMCA to her time at the famous Second City troupe to SNL and 30 Rock.<br /><br />Fey coats hard truths with humor, making them easier to swallow, and throughout the book, she effortlessly advocates feminism. It's clear to see she has lived and continues to embrace the idea that women shouldn't be afraid to be heard in every facet of life.<br /><br />Whether she's discussing the childhood trauma of choosing the wrong cleaning solution or sharing the same stage with VP-hopeful Sarah Palin, Tina Fey keeps her reader in stitches and demonstrates why she's one of the most successful women in television.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|This book is so good! I didn't want to put it down. The vivid account of her rape kept me in tears on the edge of my seat.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'd heard about this here and there, but never really paid it much attention until a co-worker started talking about it. He spoke glowingly of the book, so I decided to take a peek at it the next time I went shopping. However, when I saw that it was written in first, person present tense, I freaked out a little, because that's not a style I particularly like.<br /><br />But while waiting for an oil change, I meandered the book section of the store and grabbed a copy and decided to give it a shot again.<br /><br />Boy, I'm sure glad I did.<br /><br />Set in the future where the United States no longer exists, the country is divided in to 12 districts. Residents of each district barely scrape by and their lives are harsh. However, each year, two teenagers from every district - a boy and a girl - are chosen to compete against each other in the Hunger Games at the Capitol. These games are brutal and end when only one teen is left standing.<br /><br />The book had excellent pacing, and the relationships formed early on in the Games allowed the reader to draw insight about each character and determine who to root for and who you hoped didn't make it.<br /><br />I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. There are two more in the series, and I can't wait to get started to see how it all ends.

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|must've read this book as a young child. I'm pretty sure it's required reading in American schools; however, I didn't recall much of it. Having read White Fang earlier this month, I decided I wanted to The Call of the Wild. London has this uncanny ability to translate the pure love of a relationship between dog and human. I found it remarkable in White Fang and even more so in this book.<br /><br />His storytelling is plain - no convulted, uncessary descriptions of scenes. Just simple sentence that communicate the setting and story. I am going to have read more Jack London.<br /><br />I loved Buck's story - his transformation from country dog to sled dog, and how he learned the ways of the Klondike.<br /><br />If you're a dog lover and haven't read this book, I recommend adding it to your list.
B002Q63JEU|5.0|Love it!<br />I would not have bought it if I didn't love it.<br />I will definitely buy more from this artist.
0060825456|5.0|I read the novel of this last year or the year before that. I don't quite remember. What I do recall is how much I enjoyed Gaiman's eerie story. As a fan of graphic novels, I wanted to read it in this form, too. I wish Coraline had been drawn differently. I always pictured her a bit younger with dark hair. But other than that, I had no complaints with the graphic novel.<br /><br />The Other Mother was sufficiently creepy and the cat was my favorite character, by far. The thing that impresses most about Gaiman's stories is that he tackles creepy subjects and includes quite a bit of the phantasmagorical in his work, but it never cross the line in to gore or horror. That's a pretty impressive feat.<br /><br />If you like Gaiman and graphic novels, I suggest this book.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Love it so much! One of my very favorite movies!<br />I would not have bought it if I didn't love it.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My mom used to read this book to me when I was a little kid in the early 80s. It was my favorite book, and I begged her for it every night before bed. Grover's begging pleas, humor and frustration were the perfect mix for a bedtime story.<br /><br />Now 30 years later, I've been given the opportunity to share it with my 4 1/2 year old nephew who apparently enjoys the story just as much as me! After reading it to him, he proceeded to take the book away and \\"read\\" it to me - twice! - with his own variation on the story. Because he can't quite read, he simply told me what was happening on each page.<br /><br />If you have kids, I highly recommend you put this in your library. And even if you don't, go out and read it. It's heartwarming and funny. You won't be disappointed!
B0013F1D02|5.0|Love love it!  This one was recommended to me by a friend, and it is now added to my favorites!
B007HGPIX4|5.0|As always, Gail Carriger delivers a whopping good story. This is actually \\"Changeless,\\" the second book in her Parasol Protectorate series. In this book, Alexia and Conall Maccon have traveled to Scotland to investigate what has suddenly caused supernaturals to remain human and lose their abilities.<br /><br />During their adventures, they meet the inimitable Madam Lefoux - a French inventor with an eye for the ladies who isn't all she seems.<br /><br />When they arrive in Scotland, Connal is forced to confront his old pack which betrayed him while Alexia searches for the supernatural weapon. An encounter with a spy leads Alexia to an exciting revelation, which isn't as warmly received as she would hope!<br /><br />This is a terrific manga-zation of \\"Changeless.\\" The story is kept intact and Rem's artwork is beautiful. I cannot wait to read Vol. 3!
B00DSGPZ12|1.0|There is none. You start at 1500 feet and then you have 1 choice, down. The only way to climb is to go inverted but then you stall before you gain enough altitude to reach the runway.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If you're a Neil Gaiman fan, prepare to be surprised by the intimate tone of his latest book. Gaiman's story - magical, remarkable and dark - is perhaps his most revealing work to date. As I read this book, I felt Gaiman was sharing bits and bobs of his own childhood, skillfully woven into the fictional narrative. The result was the feeling that I was reading a somewhat biographical account of his own life.<br /><br />I will never be able to do justice to this story. All I can say is go read this book and be prepared to laugh, to cry and be given a glimpse into this amazing man's life.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game! Once I start playing I can't stop, until I run out of lives. It's a great game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second in a trilogy, Catching Fire is a relatively fast read. However, just because it's fast doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Katniss has returned to District 12 only to discover her life there is as fraught with trouble as it was during The Hunger Games. Although she's no longer struggling for her life - at first - her relationship with Peeta is cold, her friendship with Gale strained and she's having difficulty adjusting to her new life of luxury.<br /><br />But all of that changes when President Snow shows up and threatens her life and those that she loves. She must be marry Peeta, and worse, she and Peeta are to return to 75th Hunger Games along with two past victors from each district.<br /><br />Once in the ring, she fights to keep Peeta alive so he can emerge as the victor, but what she doesn't know is the other tributes are fighting to keep her alive, because she has unwittingly become the face of the rebellion. Through the course of the games, friends are made and lost. At the end, through the efforts of her allies and a fantastic shot with her arrow, the games are brought to a halting end with an explosive blast.<br /><br />Katniss wakes up to find herself in a medical unit, Peeta nowhere to be found. But her old friend Gale is there, and he has a horrific message to deliver: The fate that befell District 13 so many years ago - obliteration by the Capitol - has fallen upon District 12. It's been decimated and no longer stands.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|This show is action packed, humorous, and has a great cast.  If you like sci fi you will love this.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I've been a fan of Ellen's writing since picking up her first book \\"My Point... And I Do Have One\\" back in high school. She's funny, witty, relatable and honest. Plus, she's optimistic and positive.<br /><br />This book combines her random thought conversation style and throws in bits and pieces from her own life. I think her willingness to be honest and share things from her experience is one of the main reasons she connects so well with her readers/audience. Another reason is that even though she is relentless in encouraging people to be positive, look for the joys in life and appreciate every day, she never comes across as pushy or preachy.<br /><br />I laughed a lot while reading this, and when I was done, I felt really good about my life and how lucky I am for what I have. I recommend you read this book. I think you'll be glad you did.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|What it means to be human card has laid out like no other writer since Dostoyevsky in my opinion. Amazing.
B002OMZTSU|4.0|I picked up this book on a lark. I knew of Craig Ferguson - more from occasionally seeing his show at night (I like to sleep, so I rarely catch it) and honestly, from \\"How to Train Your Dragon.\\" I'd forgotten he was on the Drew Carey show, because I rarely saw it.<br /><br />But after reading this book, I really like this guy and want to see more of his work. Ferguson is funny. He's a comedian. He should be. But funny comedians don't always write funny books that have heart. Ferguson does. He's brutally honest about his life, addictions and the mistakes he made while figuring out who he was and where he wanted to go with his life. Because of this, I developed an instant connection with him and found myself turning the pages to see what would happen next.<br /><br />It's obvious that he loves his family very much and is a driven individual. He was fortunate to have realized he needed help with his addictions before they claimed his life. And it's gratifying to see the success he found in his professional and personal life after getting clean and sober.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough. It will make you laugh and cry. You will leave it with a smile and a respect for a man who isn't afraid to be honest with his shortcomings while being grateful for his successes.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|loved this game and it kept me looking and looking and looking for the clues.  thanks for having it available
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an excellent finish to a truly enjoyable and emotionally packed series. I'm glad Collins kept it realistic and didn't provide happy endings for everyone involved. Had she, the characters and their situations would have somehow rang less true. I also like the twist at the end, although it wasn't so much of a twist for the reader as it was for Katniss.<br /><br />All in all, this was an excellent series. Although I wish there were more, I realize that to prolong it further would have made it seem repetitive.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered my Chromecast on the last day of the Netflix promotion, and I received it 7/29.  I used a PC Laptop to set it up.  As all the other users have noted, setup is SIMPLE and direct.  Yes, you need to use either the USB adapter or the Power Adapter to give the unit power!  From my iPad and iPhone, casting from Netflix and YouTube was great.  From my laptop, casting from YouTube and Netflix was good, but casting video or audio from other websites using the Google Chrome Browser Cast plugin was terrible.  HOWEVER, turns out that my laptop is old and slow.  Using my desktop, casting video and audio from websites using the cast button in Chrome worked wonderfully - just a slight delay initially, then smooth as silk, and in full 720p.  I received my Netflix code today, and it worked perfectly - the email with the code has a &#34;learn more&#34; link; follow that link to get directions to redeem your code.  BUT even if you don't get the Netflix code, for $35 this product is amazing!  I have 4+ year old 1080p HDTV without WiFi, away from my router and cable box, and now it's instantly a wireless TV to which I can broadcast YouTube and Netflix - perfect!

B0064MGU98|4.0|This show gives an honest inside look on emotions and potential consequences of actions in the work place. They do not omit some of the real life questions that stems from their decisions. The courtroom drama, process and relationships are also compelling. You don't always know what to expect and you get insight on each character's psyches and moral compass. Good show.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I can't say this game was addicting or super fun but it was entertaining. It kept me occupied for quite a while and it didn't give me any problems. The only thing that really bothered me was that there wasn't really anything new to do as you progressed levels other than getting new food to make and more designing options. Also the numerous adds that popped up eve every time I turned on the game really annoyed me. Overall the game was good and I enjoyed making different and various typed of food to serve to people and mingling with friends and new people was pretty fun. And for a free game, well get it yourself and you'll be surprised at how fun it is. I mean its free. So why not?
B004HWYTP4|3.0|I would recommend watching this movie.  I watched it because I hear &#34;Red 2&#34; is better than the first so wanted to check it out before seeing the sequel.  Overall good movie.

B0067RQYNW|5.0|I just stumbled onto this free office suite and really like it. I was using another free office suite, but it kept freezing up. This office suite has many functions similar to Microsoft Office. You can even password protect a document or spread sheet. So far it hasn't frozen or locked up. And many people said it is a trial program, but so far, everything works and they haven't asked me to buy it or upgrade. I use it on the kindle fire hd tablet.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|A little disappointed in this book.  I expected a little better content<br />and depth from Tina. Try again Tina, I know that you can do better.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I really like this file management program. You really need it for the Kindle Fire HD if you want to sideload something or just delete a file. Most programs when uninstalled leave many files on your tablet, but you can easily delete, move, copy, change their names etc.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Not as epic as American Gods, or as complicated as Neverwhere, The Ocean at the End of the Lane feels like Gaiman's most personal book.  A little nightmare of a story, it is an exacting memory of the feelings of childhood, the little details that draw the line between the mind of a boy and the way of adults.  There is very little to this story, but just in the manner that dreams don't have a narrative but leave you pulsing, this book is not one that you are likely to forget.  The closest analogue is the narrative control of \\"Never Let Me Down\\" mixed with the subject-matter of \\"Sandman.\\"  Wonderful, unusual book - and a book that deepens my understanding of his other books.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This probably the best free weather program out there. You can put your home town in and many other cities and look at maps and see rain coming in your direction. I will say the version before this new updated version I liked better because it had no ads. Now there are ads everywhere. Of course you have to be connected to wifi for the program to work.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great free calculator. When you turn your kindle off and go back to it later, all of your past calculations are stored in the calculator. I just found this out. You simply press an area under where the answer is and the whole screen of buttons goes away and you can see your past calculations until you hit clear. Very handy calculator.
B004PGO25O|3.0|First, I liked the short book.  It offered inspiration and a review of one approach to the project process.  As a writer I found it replicated the process used by many modern, self published authors.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is very similar to bejeweled which I have played for years. It has many levels to conquer and is very fun.

B004I744AS|5.0|I originally didn't care for this dictionary because to get to the medical dictionary, you had to have wifi connection. But I paid the $3.99 and found the dictionary stored on your Kindle Fire HD is much larger than the free version and does have most medical terms offline, but when you hit online, if you are near wifi, the same medical term is pages and pages of material from many medical sources. So the offline gives you an abbreviated definition, while the online goes into great detail.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Forget about the lack of fluff. This set gets the most important thing right.... the sound! This set fixes everything that was wrong with \\"Six Pack\\".  For under $5.00 a disc, what more could you expect?
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I got this game on Amazon Kindle Fire HD's free app for the day. I believe it costs $1.99. I really like the graphics and the ability to select the type of tiles that you want. Some of the tiles look very similar, but this program gives you the ability to select the tile front type of characters.

B004LWZW42|2.0|After the disappointment of X-Men the Last Stand and X-Men Origins Wolverine, I was hoping that First Class would finally get this broken franchise back on track.  With Brian Singer, the director of the first two X-Men movies, returning to direct I was anticipating a film that would make up for the last two duds.  I admit when I first saw this film I liked it okay.  However, like with Origins, as time passed, I thought about it more, and as I watched other reviews my opinion changed.  I ultimately found First Class to be a big disappointment.  It is not as bad as the Last Stand and Origins, but it is pretty close.<br /><br />There are a few really good things about this film.  In my opinion these few things save this film from being entirely awful.  James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender do an outstanding job as a young Professor X and Magneto.  I will even go as far as to say that McAvoy and Fassbender are as good a Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as the older versions.  Plus Kevin Bacon was very fun to watch.  I do not like the villain, himself, Shaw, but Kevin Bacon gives a great performance.  I am a fan of Kevin Bacon as an actor.  I think that he is good in anything that he is in whether it is good or bad.  Those three actors are the saving graces to this movie.  There are also some decent action scenes but I have seen better in the other X-Men films.<br /><br />One of the big problems with this movie is that I am not sure where this movie stands in relation with the other movies.  For a long while I confused on whether this is a prequel or a reboot.  I was leaning toward the reboot option at first.  However, this movie feels more like it is trying to be a prequel.  The film deals with the friendship between Magneto and Professor X and when they finally became enemies.  It also works in how Charles became paralyzed.  Plus if this was a reboot it is a letdown overall.  If they were starting fresh I would expect them to use the original X-Men team and this time incorporate all of the original X-Men like Cyclops, Gene, Storm, Wolverine, Beast, Angel, etc.  Instead they give us mostly mutants we have never even heard of unless you are a big comic book reader.  Not to mention that the new X-Men film, The Wolverine, takes place after The Last Stand.  So clearly this is not a reboot.<br /><br />However, this movie is not really a prequel either.  First Class contradicts many things set-up in not only the Last Stand and Origins, but also the first two movies.  For example, in the first X-Men they say that Professor X and Magneto created Cerebro, but here it was made by Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult).  In this movie they establish that Charles and Mystique knew each other since they were kids and grew-up together.  However, in the first three movies we have been given no indication whatsoever that they knew each other at all let alone grew-up together.  Also it has been stated in the other movies that Charles and Eric/Magneto knew each other for years before they became enemies.  In this film they only knew each other for about a week before becoming foes.  Another weird thing is that Dr. Moira (Rose Byrne) is set up as potential love interest for Charles, but she never appears again in the other films.  Those are just a few of the inconsistencies this film has with the others.  If this is a prequel then it fails as a prequel.<br /><br />Another problem is that the characters, other than Charles and Magneto, are not interesting at all and honestly are quite irritating.  Mystique seems to only be in this film to create forced drama with Charles, Magneto, and Hank.  I get where she is coming from, but she comes off as very whiny and a bit slutty.  Mystique was not like that at all in the other films.  The other X-Men like Banshee, Darwin, or any of the others I did not care for.  I found them boring and too whiny as well.  Hank was alright but I never cared about his plight.  Throughout the film he tries to create this serum to make himself normal.  He tells Mystique that it is better to look normal.  However their circumstances are completely different.  Mystique's mutation is throughout her body, while Hank's mutation is only his feet which he can easily hide.<br /><br />The villains are also very generic.  While I like Kevin Bacon, I think his character, Shaw, is a lame and idiotic villain.  His ultimate plan is one of the dumbest villain plots I have ever seen.  He wants to start a nuclear war so that mutants can take over the planet.  Mutants are not any more immune to nuclear bombs than normal people.  If nuclear war happened the mutants would die along with the humans.  It makes no sense.  Plus Shaw's accents grated on me.  Sometimes he has a German accent and other he has a Southern accent.  Both accents do not sound authentic at all.  Emma Frost I found to be lame as well.  Plus the special effect of her turning into crystal was beyond terrible.<br /><br />The effects for this film are quite lackluster.  Sometimes the effects are good but most times they were on par with X-Men Origins Wolverine, and that is not a good thing.  For example when Hank fully transforms into Beast he looks horrible.  The effect of Emma Frost in her crystal form is also really bad.  The Last Stand's Beast at least looked really good and was played by a better actor.  The effects in X-Men, X2, and even the Last Stand are miles better than the effects in First Class.<br /><br />Overall, X-Men First Class is a highly disappointing and highly overrated film.  I do not understand how this film can be so highly praised by both fans and critics.  It is currently the highest rated X-Men film on Rotten Tomatoes.  It is rated even higher than X2 which is entirely ridiculous.  First Class is not even in the same league as X2 in my opinion.  I think that the first X-Men film is also much better than this film.  It more enjoyable to watch than The Last Stand and Origins, but that is not saying much.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it very fast, unable to focus on much else until the story was done.  I must say though that the beginning of the story is much stronger than the end, which was something of a disappointment.  Elizabeth lived until 1503, but the story peters out in 1499, leaving out some of the significant events of her life, such as the marriage and death of her eldest child Arthur.  I wished the story would have continued until her death, and I found myself wishing the same about Philippa Gregory's other novels.  She always seems to end them too early.<br /><br />Although I recommend this book, I think it is very historically inaccurate, and I hate to think that Henry VII's reputation is about to be dragged in the mud just as Richard III's is being rehabilitated.<br /><br />Regarding Henry VII, I believe this story to be an interesting work of fiction.  There is much in this story that is pure speculation and will never be proven to be true or false.  I am not sure if Elizabeth was ever in love with her uncle Richard III, and sincerely doubt that they ever slept together, however it creates a fascinating jumping off point for her marriage to Henry.  It certainly explains his horrible behavior toward her early in their relationship.  In truth, Henry was not a perfect man, but he was a good king and a good husband.  He may have been anxious and miserly, but all sources indicate that their marriage was a happy one, and he would never have forced himself on his wife or vented his anger towards her.  He was a gentle husband and a doting father, and Elizabeth was a mild mannered, contented wife who deferred to her mother in law in all matters.  The brief part of the book that shows them happy in each other's arms is probably more accurate than the way their marriage is portrayed in the beginning and end of the story-- though perhaps their passion is a bit exaggerated, but who knows?  They may not have been passionate lovers like Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, as they married for politics and not for love, but Elizabeth was a beautiful young woman, and surely Henry was proud to have her as a wife.  They produced seven children together, and probably found real happiness, stability, and deep love when together as a family, surrounded by their children.  I truly believe that they were happy together throughout the entire marriage, and their relationship was not the roller coaster of instability the novel portrays.  But that said, this novel is certainly a fascinating read and I enjoyed it.
B006S086AM|2.0|Had a few funny moments. Not bad for free, but definitely not the best. One time watch type of movie..
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved this book.  I am a fan of the t.v series &#34;the big bang theory&#34; and the main character in the book reminded me of Sheldon, one of the characters from the t.v show.  Sheldon is highly intelligent and very aspergus.  Trying to live as &#34;normal&#34; people live is something these characters desire, but really challanges their sense of reason.  The story is is warmly amusing.  The characters struggle initially with relationships but manage to get beyond the boundrys that hold them back.  I can see this book being made into a movie but hope they dont ruin it like they did with &#34;the silver lining playbook&#34; another great read.
B008F9E306|5.0|Good album, nice beats and lyrics---this man took time and made this music....<br />Hats off to TIP---another HEADBANGER / RIDING MUSIC

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game it really is fun and makes you wanna just keep playing I just can't seem to be able to put the game down one I get started I can't stop
B003G4W49C|3.0|I always try to finish a book once I've started, but this was not one that I looked forward to picking up everyday. I will admit that I'm not a huge sci-fi reader, but I heard great things about this book and thought I would enjoy it a bit more. I felt like the author gave way too many details about every individual battle and strategy Ender had. I like the idea of the book, I just feel like it could have been a lot shorter.
1451648537|5.0|Great book if your interested in the life of a very successful yet unconventional person. He by no means sets a good example to be followed by others but there are many interesting insights into what made him so special that are fascinating.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The fact that so many Christian evangelical/fundamentalist types hate Zealot, despite not having read it, motivated me to buy it.  I figured if it could send them into fits of rage, then there had to be something redeeming in it.  And apparently their disdain for the book is driving its sales higher.  I love the irony!  Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|I don't like the gore in nearly every show, but<br />I do like the humor and the strong friendship<br />among the main characters! I sincerely believe<br />in marriage, so I am truly hoping that the powers<br />that be will decide to have Bones and Booth get<br />married. Ryan O'Neal is so good, but I really<br />like Hodgens(& Angela). Love his experiments!
B008RTE066|3.0|I was excited to get this and now I am not very impressed by much of the extras.  I love the Hello Goodbye promo film, but that was certainly not what they menu listed as a \\"Hello Goodbye Promo film\\".  It was a little goofy stop action type of home movie with four people I could not identify.  There would be momentary cuts to the Beatles in the cutting room. And it was all in Black and White. The Hello Goodbye promo film is actually the Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper outfits playing the song on a stage in a theater in London somewhere.  Near the end some Go-go girls come in and dance with them.  Why that was not included is beyond me.  They should have also included the Our World TV broadcast of the Beatles recording All you Need is Love.  It would have been great to add in real promo films for Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields as well. The two I mentioned should certainly have been included. The Deluxe falls short.  The big booklet is not that great and the original EP set on vinyl is cute, but not worth the extra money. Save your money and buy the standard edition, it has all the video extras on it anyway.
B002N2SYAG|5.0|Don't like the gore, but I do like the affection & humor<br />between the main characters.  Not sure why the FBI<br />gets involved in so many cases, but it's a likeable<br />show with a likeable cast.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am skeptical of weather apps that occupy most of my screen with popups and advertising. This app provides LOTS of weather info and a minimum of ads. Information is clean, comprehensive, provides choices and is easy to use. Good stuff!
B006O6F4O6|4.0|The batpod with the batman looks good; without the action figure it looks anemic. Would have preferred a better pod and action figure with more articulation.
B006Y5EDRG|3.0|I don't think the folks who made SMASH knew who their target audience was.  It might appeal to the young people who like GLEE, but there is too much adult content for them.  I don't think people outside of NYC are that interested in Broadway theatre.  It needed an adult audience and I don't think there were enough adults who would like it.  They had Katharine McPhee from American Idol and had a built-in audience who would have watch her in anything.  But, for the most part, that audience would be young girls and parents would not want them watching the bedroom scenes.  And, I really like Debra Messing, but why did they add the romance between her and the actor who played Joe Dimaggio?  It made me squirm.  And, I really like Angelica Huston, but I didn't enjoy her character.  I would give it 3 stars.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|Keeps requiring more purchaces to perhaps get it to work. Fonts, dictionary, etc.<br />Yet it doesn't do much, so don't expect 'word' here.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Do not understand how this series was cancelled.  I watched both seasons (only 1 & 2) and you could not pull me away.  Love, Love, Love
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I thought this might be just another blah vampire movie so didn't know what to expect from this movie but actually turned out to be decent.
B0041D843M|5.0|My husband and I have been vegan for 2 years.  This book confirms that we are eating the correct foods.  The research studies are so interesting; I couldn't put this book down until I was done. I appreciate Dr. Campbell's ability to explain the results of each study and why certain food cause health problems. I highly recommend this book and will be offering it as an &#34;extra credit&#34; reading assignment for my science students.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|I found myself looking at the clock because it was a long movie.  I think the housewives were cartoonish in their hatred and the maids didn't live up to their Academy Award nominations and win.  That said, this is an important part of our history that everyone should see and teach their children because versions of this discrimination are happening NOW.  I think the scenes in &#34;The Blind Side&#34; where the women talk about Big Mike were much better.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I have read all of Flynn's books and they are all uniquely dark and cover topics in such twisted ways the plot lines seem so real.  I would recommend all her books to anyone looking for twists in plot lines and the lack of humanity that most of the world sees today.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story is well paced and interesting with many unexpected twists and turns. You keep reading because you want to find out what happens next all the while you are trying to figure out what the truth is. I have started on the sequel, &#34;Shift.&#34;
0525425772|3.0|I'm a great fan of Grisham's courtroom-drama fiction so when I saw this title pop up I bought it.  But upon reading it I realized:<br />this is intended for adolescents.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I will likely use this book as a class reader with my 8th graders.  It illustrates the process that genius is not the only factor that creates change in the world.  A genius himself Tesla recognized that imagination and hard work are the essential elements needed to change the world.  This is the essence of what teachers need to instill in their students.  Kudos!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Lzzy Hale is a talented and creative artist. She really can rock out and I love her voice. She leads the female rockers in America. So glad I bought this album.  Yes her name is spelled correctly.

B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game. You must stay patient if you do not want to spend money for this app. not sure how the strange monsters come in but nevertheless an addictive game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Begun playing the game with my niece. Can't get enough!!! I would recommend this game to anyone. Have fun it is well worth it.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nelson DeMille came through again. I feel like I know his characters; they are so well defined. As I've said before, his humor is delicious. Corey seemed more thoughtful in this book and it works well. Love the dialogue vs. the thoughts in the character`s head. Great read!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I got this as the faotd and have been happily playing for an hour. I like the lack of it being timed, sometimes just figuring out the right way to do it is enough. my 10 yr old who has learning disabilities is learning a lot from trying the puzzles (although she frustrates easily and her logic is sometimes skewed) I wish there were more levels and possibly a hint button for my kids.....overall a good game that downloaded and functioned fine on my first gen kindle.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|its a whole lot better than the other btds.  I play this game for an entire day.  it is so much fun.
0345529057|4.0|Absolutely loved the books...though was expecting better quality of books.....something similar to hard cover but it was not that good.
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|Bunny Mania 2 HD is an alright app. It took me a long time to figure out how to play and when I did I wasn't satisfied. When I watched the video I thought it would be a cute game, but it was very boring, and sometimes was very glitchy. It kept forcing close almost every time I opened up the app. Overall, this game looks cute but is a very difficult and glitchy app.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like this game<br />Downloaded it bc my husband has it on it tablet, confused me at first but it US very addictive
B00992CF6W|4.0|Download to my Kindle and while it is not as robust as the ipad version - it certainly kept the kids entertained.  Mission accomplished..
B00061QK02|1.0|The DVD never worked. There was an obvious issue on the underside of the DVD, it looked like the type air bubble you'd get when putting a decal on a car... It was only $1, but it sure was a wasted dollar!!
8866130915|1.0|This is totally useless for anyone with an ACTUAL schedule. If you need it for a basic day calendar that is probably fine, but if you do more than 4 things per day this is way too small.

B00CLD65X0|5.0|I was happy just to get my Kindle Fire and then I got one month of Amazon Prime for free. So I thought I'd check out Downton Abbey since all my friends were talking about it....now I'm addicted..  The show is amazing and the Kindle Fire was awesome...watched 3 seasons worth...can't wait for number 4.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A breath-taking page turner that keeps you on the edge of your seat! Catching Fire takes the Hunger Games to a whole new level.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I just simply couldn't put it down.  Really enjoyed Strayed's trek on the Pacific Coast Trail and her lessons learned on the trip.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The game is very enjoyable. Good graphics and game play. One of the best rpg's you can find in Amazon app store.

B001XUJMZK|5.0|I love this movie one of my favorites. Mel Gibson makes william wallace look heroic in this great epic GOOD
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If you loved the music from the movie, get this soundtrack.  No regrets!  I heard there was another CD with more songs, but I have no idea if that's any good.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|This is an app that  is helpful to seeing more of my email.  My native email app only shows me new mail.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Things to love about this movie:<br /><br />1.  the music<br />2.  the characters<br />3.  the performances<br /><br />Things to not love about this movie:<br /><br />4.  I actually was not a fan of Anna Kendrick's performance.  She was fine.  Just not outstanding.<br />5.  The Asian girl in the movie has punch lines, but she's not an actual CHARACTER.  She just has lines.  I hate that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game may look like its for kids but I'm in my thirties and I love it. I play it whenever I have free time. Its so much fun and frustrating when I fail a level. I love the minions!!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Plenty of action, lots of surprises, and victory in impossible situations make this a great guy flick.  How do these old guys still throw believable punches?
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This great app has reminded me how much fun this gaming system is to play. Hurling massively powerful creatures at your opponent, creating swarms of insects, mind control, cloning... this has it all! Not as intense as sitting across a table from your duelling partner but the next best thing. Massive potential for variety and personalisation of your decks and playing styles and has and will continue to give many hours of pleasure.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Enjoying this series.  Well acted and good plot development.  Enjoying both the legal cases and the people stories in this show.

1476712042|5.0|I read Walking Disaster first so I kind of knew what was happening. However I Love seeing it from her side. It is a great book that is written beautifully!
B0064MGU98|4.0|The episodes were well-written and the characters are really interesting. I would recommend it! It took me a while to get through the first season though!
B001KL0WJW|4.0|Just remembered the movie from a kid and passed it on to mine. It had the same entertainment impact that normally doesn't carry over in older movies.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|While he's not always the most consistent writer, in my opinion, this is a classic Grisham thriller with lots of twists and turns and a little bit of nail-biting.  As a reader, I was almost tempted to think (a time or two):  &#34;Who could have ever come up with a plan like this?&#34;  But then, I remember that Grisham did, and it was a lot of fun following along.  I was happy to see him back on his game, and I'm looking forward to his next thriller with a legal twist.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Better than the first. I especially like the unabashed parodies of 80's action heroes. All sequences are not taken too seriously and playful winks are given throughout.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I ended up with a free Showtime subscription through my cable provider, and I was almost immediately gripped by this series.  Like couldn't stop watching to eat levels of gripped.  So well acted, so well plotted, such three-dimensional characters.  I will say that the Claire Danes crying jags toward the end of the season started to get on my nerves a little bit, but I didn't stop watching for a minute, and I can't say that they were out of sync with what her character was going through.  I was totally hooked and ready for Season 2 at the end.
140006922X|1.0|Reza Aslan's book \\"Zealot\\" is a pseudo-academic fraud ! An Islamic propaganda based on the Quranic fairytale of \\"Issa\\".<br /><br /> The author developed his thesis based on his religious islamic dogmas not from the Gospel accounts of Jesus.<br /><br /> Aslan makes the erroneous and refuted claim that Jesus was a Jewish zealot trying to liberate Israel from Roman occupation.<br /><br />This book is garbage, I can't believe people are actually buying this and giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />Aslan knew that his \\"Faux News\\" interview will attract attention... Pathetic !
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Okay, in my opinion, Malkovich absolutely steals this movie.  He's so crazy and so in character throughout...both hilarious and a little melancholy.  Just awesome.  Lots of action, lots of humor, some cool effects (check out the Mythbusters where they try to recreate the scene in the tractor trailer yard) and a whole bunch of spies.  What's not to love!  From start to finish, I think the story was very well-crafted and just a whole lotta fun.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I don't know if this book will ever be truly appreciated to it's potential, because of it's location in the sci-fi genre.  However, the author creates a believable near future that revolves around amazing characters rather than sci-fi gadgetry.  This is a rare work that anybody can appreciate, even if they're not sci-fi people.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I thought this was excellent - Lee Child at his best, and Reacher, too!  Many prior reviews have discussed points of plot, so I won't duplicate their efforts.  What I loved most about the book is how it really displays Reacher's strengths and I particularly liked the no-nonsense ending (in terms of dealing with the &#34;bad guys&#34;).  So Reacher.  A solid addition to the body of work.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|This movie never gets old.  Instant classic and now really classic.  If you ever want to spot your generation (if you're my generation), all you have to do is walk into a random room and shout \\"Heeeeeeyyyyyyy you guuyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyys!\\"  You'll know who your people are after that.  Of course the young'uns won't get it and somebody will probably call the cops.
B004GYY714|5.0|I am currently paying for other service in my car, but when it time to renew, I will not be doing so. This is entertainment for the next century.  A simple app and you can listen to music from around the world through your Android device wherever you are.  Most likely there is new and talk shows as well, but me...I am happy with the great selection of virtual commercial free music.
B0031RS64G|4.0|Whoever said fantasy can't be ambitious? This book throws the reader right into the middle of a huge canvass that encompasses empire, heroes, sorcery and gods - and just expects the reader to keep up. It was a refreshing change to have my mind exercised while reading fantasy and I look forward to picking up the rest of this series.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|One of our children's favorites! There are no voices, but it doesn't matter because the characters are so expressive.  Very humorous.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I think this game is very interesting so far. the graphics are well done &amp; it's not so hard I have to struggle to figure out the next steps. I am enjoying it as I donmost g5 games.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|First off, this is NOT one of the Donner/Reeves Superman movies, nor is it Superman Returns - that seems to be the beef with many people giving this movie bad reviews.  This movie stands on its own, as those earlier movies did, too.  But, to paraphrase someone else, if you are a true Superman fan, you'd like 'em all.<br /><br />The movie spends a lot of time delving into the experiences and events shaping Clark Kent's life prior to donning the Superman suit, but without dwelling too long on them (think flashbacks), including the fate of Krypton at the time of his birth.  This also explains his actions once he dons the suit.  At times the movie is fast paced, and as this is in effect an origin story, character development for some of the supporting cast is therefor sacrificed (fodder for sequels?).  Some have commented that the \\"spark\\" between Superman and Lois is missing, but given the amount of time they spend together in the movie, and under the circumstances they are together, romance would be far-fetched, but their budding relationship is established.  The movie has also been criticized for excessive violence - perhaps, but if a ship load of Kryptonians arrived with the same powers as Superman, and they were intent on destroying Earth to remake it as a new Krypton, wouldn't you expect violence to ensue?  Another criticism I feel is unwarranted is the lack of humor (again, shipload of really bad Kryptonians - where's the humor in that?) - the movie has some humor, but it is subtle - such as when he is learning to fly, or when he is handcuffed...and then there is the episode with the truck.  At no point did I find the movie slow or boring.  To be honest, there were a few things I found questionable - I had a hard time understanding what some things were on Krypton, and it wasn't explained how General Zod and his crew could speak English (especially since they were just alerted to the planet's existence).  I also thought the peoples' (of Earth) reaction to the arrival of aliens from outerspace to be too low-keyed (wouldn't you expect a lot of people to be freaking out?).<br /><br />The casing was great, and credit must be given to Henry Cavill - he LOOKS like Superman - he could have literally jumped off a page in the comic books.  I'm glad they updated the suit - spandex and the red underpants would have been dated!  And they explained its origin.  However, I can't help wonder about the cape - why?  What purpose does it serve?  If we learn anything in life, it should be the immortal words of Edna 'E'Mode from the incredibles: \\"NO CAPES\\"!<br /><br />With or without a cape, looking forward to the sequel.val of aliens from outerspace to be too low-keyed (wouldn't you expect a lot of people to be freaking out?).<br /><br />The casing was great, and credit must be given to Henry Cavill - he LOOKS like Superman - he could have literally jumped off a page in the comic books.

B00C061I3K|3.0|I grew up with Daft Punk and loved their sound. They were unique samplers that made it their own, while still giving credit to the original songs. It would bother me if Lemmy from Motörhead started playing the zither. Yeah, he'd still be a badass... but his appearance and image that he's worked so hard on creating would clash with his zither music. Or trumpet... or bluegrass.<br /><br />That's why it kinda hurts me to see Daft Punk not change their name into Daft Funk or try to actually become humanized by changing their image. Taking off the masks and \\"becoming human\\" would have made this album phenomenal. Robots finally making the transition into human and creating their first album with 70's groove and funk--now that's something I could get behind and jam to. I understand the message they're trying to send, but it's just an odd combination. I like the album, it's great, but I'd rather listen to it fully without knowing it was Daft Punk... because in my eyes, Random Access Memories isn't them.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Fire has definitely gone out in this series. I suppose I should be glad it's done. Probably the least satisfying ending to a book I've ever read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for children and adults gets harder the more you play and challenging friends is great too try it
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|A friend recommended it and its just as Good as the first. It's a must see. Just Absolutely Beautiful. My Son even loves it and his 3.
B004GYY714|5.0|Everything i needed to choose the sounds I want to hear at any time.<br /><br />And the sound is clear as a bell.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I definitely could not keep all of the names straight, but don't let that stop you from letting yourself become a part of this magical world.  you won't be sorry.  Not an easy read, but a quick, fun and entertaining one.  you will fall in love with the characters.
B005HSL626|5.0|a fun way to pass time while waiting in line or waiting for appointments. I definitely would recommend it to anyone.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am so sad to say that I don't have the time to read the rest in the series and have started watching the tv show instead.  The TV show is definitely entertaining, but doesn't hold a candle to the storyline in the book.  Please, read the book before you watch the show on tv.
B002UZCJP2|4.0|This movie Delivers on Multiple scales. Bruce Willis is bound and determined to put an end to the chaos that is destroying his life and could destroy a large portion of humanity.
B0031R5K68|4.0|As all Dan Brown books you're captured from the first page. And then you're taken on a whirlwind with a lot happening. I enjoyed this book a lot!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I had to read Treasure Island in high school.  I think (?) I enjoyed it, even though it was &#34;homework&#34;.  But now, I appreciate his description, dialogue, slang usage, the plots (and subplots), historical context.  It is a pleasrable read, just perfect to end the day.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|So many issues with this app it isn't funny.  Changes and resyncs everything despite checking no with every upgrade or update.  Wish they would fix it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it, wished it would never come to an end.  So sad I have to wait for the new season!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Less sex and more tenderness, would make it a wonderful read, in my humble opinion!  Recommend for a lazy afternoon.
B003YZU53A|4.0|This is a beautiful movie, worth seeing for anyone who has an open heart and believes in the power of love. It's somewhat low-budget and predictable, not like a complicated Hollywood movie, but more like a sweet, simple Lifetime movie. But definitely worth it.<br /><br />I have a complaint with Amazon's movie rental policy of of needing to watch the whole movie within a 24 period of starting it, or being forced to re-pay the full rental fee for another night. This movie is almost 3 hours long, and we just couldn't finish the whole thing on the first night, had to crash & go to bed. I found it appalling that we had to pay the full $4.99 the next night because it had been about 25 hours since we started it. Someone said this is due to Amazon's distribution contracts with the movie companies. Sorry but I'm not buying it...a company as powerful as Amazon can certainly negotiate a contract that allows the customer a bit longer rental period once they've paid. Won't rent from Amazon again
B00004RJ71|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this epic.  I watched this from beginning to end in one sitting, as it keep my attention.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Just got this game and so far I think it's a very good game for the money. Very clear graphics nice sound when watch is made, haven't had much time to be more exact in this review,but it is just what I expected. You should give it a try .
B006S086AM|5.0|I have seen this movie at least 3 times and I enjoy it every time.  It's just a fun movie.  Great humor and the cast is very good.  I am not a big fan of Kristen Stewart, but she's alright in this one and the rest of the cast has great chemistry.
B000001EPB|5.0|I enjoy all of Michaels music, dances. I never get tired of watching them. He is such a gifted man.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|One of the best defense games I've played. Lots of different t things to use and setup while you play
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, a new take on hansel and gretel. I wished I would've seen in at the theater.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I Love this game the graphics are good and hey lots of people love animals so I really think animal lovers will like this game
0062238868|5.0|The Book is well written, and it presents the story of Navy Seal Chief Petty Officer, Christopher Kyle and the Iraq war as it factually was at the time.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|its good for people who love to listen and make music. Its really cool and you can also look at other peoples songs too.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a beautifully written story that pulled me right into the lives of the characters. I could feel Louisa's determination to save Will and Will's unwillingness to lead a life of limitations. I couldn't put it down.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Luv this game n I'm 16 can't stop playing it its fun for all ages! :-)  really recommend it for evryone its amazing! :)
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is great! I gave this set to my uncle, and as a result he watched all 5 seasons in less than one month! However, only the first three seasons are good, it quickly goes downhill after that (and even in the first seasons there are some serious overlooks!). I recommend that you watch until the 3rd season, and then quit while you are ahead!
B001IKKMCW|5.0|Even greater blu-ray. The mask is a classic. Same deleted scenes and bonus features as the DVD. Motion picture based off of Tex Avery's screwball classics.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The plot is great, the characters are well written and acted. Certainly if you liked Season 1, you'll like season 2 even better. But opinions will vary obviously and vastly. Either you'll love the show, or you will watch something else. I'll also take a quick moment to rate Amazon Prime delivery of the content ( FLAWLESS ).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If u have not downloaded dis game u should totally do so! it is very addicting. the graphics are AWESOME, and the minions are cute!
B001EBWING|5.0|great movie, i watch it twice a year at least.  fast moving and clever story line.  great stars. it is like other movies, even more so.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Best movie ever<br />service is kinda bad<br />Sound is not so good<br />The buyer should get more than a 24 hour rental
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Play on Facebook and mobile. Unlike other games this one works the same on all platforms. Met so many great friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|For a interactive virtual pet game this is about as good as you get between feeding your horse training grooming and compations you can't get bored
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Cleopatra A Life chronicles similar period of history. Very interesting. I'm scared to read Zealot tho because it may convert me to Islam. Cleopatra almost had me worshipping Isis... Just kidding.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one cool game to play when you are bored. It makes you very competitive cuz u can compete against your friends on Facebook.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie. The picture and sound came through very good. I am planning on continuing using Amazon Prime.  They do need to add more top rated movies.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Was at first questioning to dl this or not but glad I did its a fun game reminds me of Diablo
B004QX07G4|4.0|I have been a fan of Ellen's before anyone ever really knew who she was. She was on an obscure tv show many, many years ago as a receptionist at a real estate business.  She played a ditzy secretary and was the reason I watched the show. When she wrote her first book, I had to buy it. It was the best. This book is good, and interesting, also funny, but I remember reading the first two and would be laughing so hard I cried - of course, this was before she &#34;came out&#34;. I still will buy any and every book she writes, because I think she is the greatest female comedian, along with Jane Lynch, there is.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My daughter and I play the Minecraft PE edition regularly at home and when she heard about this, she nearly screamed in excitement that Lego created this (Minecraft is essentially Lego after all.)<br />The kit is a micro-set, so don't expect regular sized bricks. It's actually quite challenging to put together, but not at all impossible. It took us a few hours over the span of a few days. Oddly enough, we did end up with about a dozen extra prices when the set was put together.<br />Overall, very happy with this purchase. Only wish there were more Minecraft Lego sets!
B0014DW3OS|5.0|This is bit out of character for him as he is rotten thru and thru. Again, watched so many times, own it but sending to a friend who might never see it were it not for me sending-do this quite often
B00CDT41RY|2.0|After a dramatic scene at dinner, the group retired to the drawing room.  Hasn't anyone noticed that the harpist was playing \\"Fur Elise?\\"  Damn thing wasn't published until 1867, yet the movie purported to take place in 1858.<br /><br />Coupled with the Jim Croce song earlier on, the misplaced historiography in Django makes the film an amateurish and self-indulgent venture.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Army of Darkness starring fan favorite Bruce Campbell (Bubba Hotep, Burn Notice) is a true classic in every sense of the word.  What started out in Evil Dead continues on as Ash is flung back in time by the demons he and his friends accidentally awoke.<br /><br />Landing in the time of King Arthur (Marcus Gilbert Dr. Who, Rambo III) Ash's misadventures lead him to try to recover the Necronomicon (originally created for the Cuthulhu mythos) The book of the dead, Ash runs afoul of an evil copy of himself (Bad Ash) and demons abound.<br /><br />The action is of course non stop and has plenty of fun for everyone, while not the &#34;nail biter&#34; Evil Dead was, this movie more than holds it own, and sill works with it's previous two chapters (Evil Dead, Evil Dead II)  With Patricia Tallman (possessed Witch) and Bridget Fonda (Linda) thrown in for fun.<br /><br />If you need something fun and slightly scary with some dark atmosphere, you couldn't make a better choice.  Oh yeah!  And bring lots of popcorn.
1476734941|5.0|I started this in early March.  4 months later, I'm down 15 lbs., with just 5 to go.  When I reach my goal weight, I'll just fast 1 day a week.  At first I found 500 calories a little tough to live with, but after about 2 weeks, I realized I was sleeping better on my fast days, and I was waking up with much less joint pain.  I've realized I won't die if I have a hunger pain.  I eat much more sensibly on my non-fast days.  This book was really worth it for me.  The recipes are easy and good and I've come up with a few of my own as well.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|This movie is for those who love action and don't really care about the acting or the story. it has almost no character development and even less of a story...mostly just stuff going boom
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the most fun,yet sometimes challenging game I have played.I go to a public rec room that has computers with this game. I could not get it on my computer,so I was so happy that I could get it on my tablet !
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Well acted and well written. I was late to find this series but, now i will follow all future seasons.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|Surprisingly, I like this film. I thought the kid, Nicholas Hoult did a good job of being a zombie with a heart and I liked him even more when my daughter remembered that he was Marcus in &#34;About a Boy&#34; we love that movie. I thought throwing a gratituitous f- bomb in there was pretty pointless. A zombie movie with a happy ending is pretty good.
0783225482|5.0|I love Bruce Willis in this movie!!! Everyone is great in it.<br />An oldie but goddie!!!<br />This is a must watch :))))
B007GOX0PA|4.0|*Note: This set is retired and while MSRP was 70, prices have subsequently risen. You can check the going rate of retired Lego sets at Bricklink.com*<br /><br />I know, all Lego sets are worth five stars. I love Lego too, but please hear me out.<br /><br />This is Lego's second house from the Creator line for 2011, the first being the Log Cabin (5766) and the third being the Lighthouse (5770). I like just about all the Creator sets because they avoid specialized pieces, often use ingenious building techniques, have multiple build directions, and usually come with a very useful assortment of bricks. Creator sets are closer to how Lego was when I was a kid.<br /><br />This is a two story white house with gray trim, a red roof, beige windows and a blue front door. This set is called the Hillside House because the house and yard are raised one brick (as if on a hill). The house has a lot going on: an electronic sound brick for the doorbell/dog bark, a blue car, carport, cool french doors, solar panel, mini-figure, dog, BBQ, etc. There are three builds, all of them feature a lift-off top for access to the lower floor. The first design also has a hinged roof portion while the second and third designs have a swinging wall that allows for additional access. I like the second design best; Lego calls it a Holiday home but it has nice modern lines and the solar panels have been turned into a small pool.<br /><br />I'm not as keen on this set as the other Creator house sets for 2011. Part of the reason is value. Though this set features an electronic brick and has some interior features, the set shows significant price inflation. Compare, for example with Lego 4954 from 2007, which was at the same price point but featured 1174 bricks versus the Hillside House's 714. The Apple Tree House (5891) from last year is still widely available, is of similar proportions (though no car or sound brick) and is 35% less. Compared to the 2011 sets, I think you get just as much playability, ifnot more, from the lower priced Log Cabin or Lighthouse (this latter one also includes an electronic light brick).<br /><br />Another reason I recommend the other sets is they are more unique. I believe the 2011 Lighthouse is the first dedicated lighthouse they've offered. The Log Cabin is also an unusual design. By comparison, Lego often has a suburban style home in their lineup. Similarly the other sets have more rare colors and shapes. White bricks and red roof tiles are classic Lego, but they are fairly common. The Log Cabin's rust roof tiles, the Lighthouse's curved corner bricks, and the Apple Tree House's blue roof tiles are more difficult to find and are very useful in making your own unique designs.<br /><br />This is still a great house with many fun features. I just don't think it stacks up as well against Lego's other offerings. And if you are a parent who tires easily of repetitive electronic toy sounds, you will want to hide the doorbell brick.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game pleasantly shocked me. I have played 100 Floors. This game is by far BETTER. It is very interactive in how you have to escape the room.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|There are so many good descriptions of this book that I won't attempt that effort. I did want to say this is one of the most delightful books I've read in quite a while.  It is enchanting.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Love the plot, characters, witty banter, most of all SHERLOCK! Such a likable series! I read somewhere that this series was made for fun and not to become famous, well congrats everybody it did. I love showing the first episode to my friends then a week later they are complete fans! Im dying for Season 3!!!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It's a delight to watch them play the game!  It definitely challenges there<br />ability to figure out how the catch the stars while getting the prize into<br />the hungry frog's mouth!<br />It peeks their interest enough to keep trying till they can figure out each challenge!
B005LAIGRS|4.0|Fast shipping! I would order  again!How much can you say about a dvd? I liked it but I wasn't crazy about it.  Denzel played a good part as usual.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|My son had a pinball machine with all the flashing lights and t his one works the  same.  I just love it.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|This album is amazing. Five Finger Death Punch continues to astound as always. Most bands seem to go downhill after a while but not these guys. I've been listening to FFDP since their first CD dropped and every time a new CD comes out it's even more amazing than the last. This album is certainly another masterpiece produced by Five Finger.  Every song has a mix of sick riffs and hardcore breakdowns yet melodic truthful lyrics I think everybody can relate to. This CD is a must have for any metal head or person looking for an amazing band. I've been counting down the days till this albums release and I stayed up until midnight to make sure I heard it right when it dropped and I'm glad I did. Buy this CD guys you won't be disappointed trust me!<br />Thank you Ivan Moody and the gang for another amazing piece of metal history!<br /><br />Pros:<br />.Sick riffs<br />.epic melodies and clean vocals<br />.Amazing price for the CD...Id easily pay $20 or $30 for it<br /><br />Cons: NONE!
B003M70O5O|5.0|There is nothing better than the sound of Harleys going down the road in large groups. Since I can no longer ride, this show makes me feel like I'm still involved. Hope it never goes off the air. It makes you wishing your life away waiting for the next episode.<br /><br />Linda in NJ
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Over same day I bought it. Good game but should be longer to be worth price. I have enjoyed other g5 games so it was disappointing
B003CJMPIG|3.0|It was entertaining but not interesting enough to view again. The movie focused on images of blood flying about from the outset. That was its strongest suit.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|These two were perfect, actually the entire cast was! Its like everyone was perfect for their role. I cannot wait for part 2.
B003U51EE8|5.0|This series is seriously addictive!!! I definitely want to see how series 4 is going to end up.  I can't wait!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|For anyone, new or classic fan of Star Wars. Everything you need. Perfect size of box and the price is fair.
B0090SI4LU|3.0|The cast, production, etc. were great. The plot is wrong; it's too soft. But then it's by Stephenie Meyer; the same person who did Twilight (teen vampires with angst)<br /><br />The aliens take over their human hosts under clinical conditions where the human is sedated. Even their eyes, once joined taken on a soft blue glow.<br /><br />Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is taken over by a being called Wanderer. Even here their not called aliens, but 'souls'. The 'souls' look like the fluffy 'souls' (Woodsprites) from the film Avatar.<br /><br />The human psyche is trapped inside their own bodies as a silent observer in what must be a living hell. In Melanie Stryder though her will is powerful enough to interact with Wanderer. She convinces Wanderer to go help her brother. This again 'softens' the aliens. They've taken over the world, imprisoned humans in their own bodies, but as Wanderer, she decides to betray her own race and help the humans.<br /><br />Even the act of getting an alien out of a host one has to 'coax' it with love and affection. This softness completely ill-suits a film about aliens taking over the world and forcing people to be assimilated. People are killed fighting the aliens, but they aliens, hey, they're just misunderstood!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know minecraft and I have it on computer and Xbox. It is nothing unlike the computer version. I already built a mansion a castle a space craft the hunger games start a barn and a town. Also a tree house.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|great series, can't wait for the fall. very glad amazon has streaming with Prime membership. A must for many people
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|It was a fun game until it kept telling me it had to refresh and made me redo missions every minute. And it wouldn't let me connect with Facebook. I got so annoyed I deleted it.
B00DU74U74|4.0|There are, of course, a LOT more details in the book. If you don't compare the two too much and think about what was changed or left out - let this stand alone, it was fun to watch. The visuals of the underground grain fields was beautiful. I thought they depicted that part of the story very well. I did NOT like the final Wanda - she is supposed to be golden haired - not someone who kind of looks like Mel. They should have stuck to the story there.
0143034901|5.0|In post World War II Barcelona, 10 year-old Daniel Sempre's widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, brings him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a repository for works forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again.<br /><br />He chooses chooses a volume from the shelves seemingly at random, but falls deeply in love with the novel he selects, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Juli&aacute;n Carax. Daniel sets out to find the rest of Carax's work, but soon discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every work the author ever wrote. In fact, he may have the last book by Carax in existence.<br /><br />Before Daniel knows it, however, his innocent quest has opened a door into one of the city's darkest secrets: an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. Worse, he soon realizes that if he doesn't find out the truth about Juli&aacute;n Carax, he and everyone he loves will suffer horribly.<br /><br />\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is the first of 3 loosely connected volumes in a trilogy centered around The Cemetery of Forgotten Books. It is a coming of age tale, a tragedy, an historical novel, a mystery and a romance, and somehow, it succeeds brilliantly as every single one of those things.<br /><br />Zaf&oacute;n's prose is gorgeous, the characters richly drawn, the setting evocative, and the plot ensnares the reader in the best possible way. This has earned a spot on my list of all-time favorites, and I recommend it highly.
B008M721MS|1.0|I got a kindle to take travelling with me, partly to use Skype to keep in touch with home. All worked brilliantly till an automatic up date, supposedly making Skype better for the tablet, downloaded it's self. I've paid to have a number on Skype and do use credit to make some calls and send texts, but I've found that being a paying customer means nothing to Skype, I am evidently worthless to them.  It was near impossible to contact anyone at Skype, it's really hard to get to the point that you can actually communicate with someone and when I finally did they weren't helpful at all.  So I got in touch with Amazon, they were great and gave me a way to overcome the problems I've been having. Albeit a temporary fix.<br /><br />The problems I've had have included, not being able to sign in, the control panel disappearing so I cannot sign in or out (once signed out automatically there was no way to sign back in), see what credit I have or access my profile. Losing all records of any texts that I have sent and paid for. The programme constantly crashes.<br /><br />Having got home from travelling I have again contacted Skype to try and resolve the problem.  Several emails have been exchanged, they have collected data from me about the problem and now have closed the case without having resolved the problem at all. I have lost money because of the problems I've had, directly from my Skype credit, I shall never see that again.  Skype is a disgrace, if anything goes wrong with the programme they are useless, it appears to be a waste of time contacting them, they don't understand their own product.
1401941893|4.0|Got the book for my wife as she was still beating herself up with some bad experience in her past relationship. The book title was \\"Treasure Yourself\\" (and its written by a super model with photo shots) so I thought why not. ;p<br /><br />I read the book out of curiosity and well, here are some of my thoughts ... its a very easy read that even teenage girls can read it without difficulty. She wrote about her life (modeling experience), her thoughts on health, beauty and relationships - quite like the usual 'love yourself' workshops that life coaches get paid to do.<br /><br />So her life was about 94 pages, photos about 8 pages (nice photos :D) and about 125 pages of 'pick from people' quotes, with her interpretation / writing about it.<br /><br />And sooo ... the conclusion for this book is ... its a very good coffee-table book! :)<br /><br />Oh btw, I would say that my rating is most definitely bias coz if you put a guy and a supermodel as the author with her photos in the book ... what do you expect? ;)
B007MDB71O|5.0|Thank you Edgar Rice Burroughs for writing such a beautiful masterpiece....and thank you (with reserve) to Disney to bring it to new life, but we want a sequel.<br />Let's go back to Barsoom with John Carter and we will dream again about our red and full of mistery neighbor.
B008LV8TSU|2.0|was told young for me. only read first few pages. Wish I could get me money back. pleas see what you can do
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I liked the attention to historical details, as it brings to life the era between the World Wars.  The story starts slowly and it was hard to maintain focus.  Compared to Downton Abbey, it lacked energy and pace.  The characters do develop fairly well and have sufficient depth, but I had trouble become enthusiastic about the series.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was really excited for the Chromecast and chose this instead of buying the Roku which turned out to be a mistake. The streaming is limited to just Youtube and Netflix.While you can just cast the Chrome tab for any other site if it is streaming video realize that both your computer and TV will be streaming two different streams at the same time which means it is very likely you will have bandwidth issues.  There are other issues as well which indicate this was a rushed product. For example there is no audio when the desktop is cast and the separate audio streaming does not seem to work. Also you will not see the mouse pointer on the TV so you always have to look at your laptop to navigate rather than the TV.<br />So if you want a streaming product that works seamlessly and supports plenty of channels get a Roku. If you want a wireless display device for your PC then get a wireless HDMI device. If you just want to tinker around then get the Chromecast.<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Update 8/1<br />After a few days of use I can no longer justify even a 3 star rating for this. First the Chromecast randomly turns my TV on when plugged even when HDMI-CEC (Toshiba Regza link) is completely disabled. Note that my laptop is fully shutdown at this point and no casting going on but if I leave the Chromecast plugged in on any port the TV will turn on within a few minutes.<br />Second but more importantly the device becomes too hot and starts freezing constantly when left plugged in for a while. Right now the screen went blank while I was watching Netflix and after I rebooted it did the new update and the screen was still blank after finishing. Now I rebooted again and it is still blank!!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones was excellent in this portrayal of a Cajun cop in deep Cajun country, investigating a current murder when an old murder is discovered out in the swamps.  As this bulldog investigator persists in his slow, jovial but serious-minded manner, he puts the ices together to unravel a deep-set social secret behind an old murder involving racial intrigue.  You need to watch carefully and listen critically as the story line and investigation develop.  This was great!  The social and cultural ambience were authentic and insightful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show has good writing and acting, but beware it is highly addicting!  It begins in 1912 in England and focuses on the lives of the wealthy Crowley family and the lives of their servants who reside on the estate.
B009TO99TG|5.0|I recently discovered Coldplay.  This Set is a great way to buy all the &#34;old&#34; Coldplay albums at a great price.  It is four individual CD's in a box sleeve holder.  Each CD is complete (compact disc, CD jacket/booklet, plastic jewel case).  You just save money by buying them all at once.  Buy it.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|Read this for a book club. Would never have read it otherwise. It was just a little too strange for me. It was a reasonably fast read but I just kept shaking my head and saying weird as I read it.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Coldplay delivers on yet another great album.  If you are a Coldplay fan, you will enjoy this album.  Coldplay takes you through a wonderful musical experience.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|These days the buzz on the Black Keys is all about the Grammy-winning release &lt;i>El Camino&lt;/i>, but I love this album just as much if not more. The steady drum and bass line give the album a feel not unlike the classic rock bands of yore with a bit of White Stripes thrown in. Auerbach's vocals are clear and soulful, with the sparse instrumentation putting the focus on lyrics that are simple but quite catchy. &#34;Next Girl&#34; and &#34;Sinister Kid&#34; are both fantastic tracks that get less play than the album's singles, and the whole thing makes a worthy gift for the kind of indie kid who wants to dance but can't quite be seen listening to Rihanna.
B007XAYKX8|5.0|There aren't too many sports where you are on 2 wheels traveling over 200+ MPH without a seatbelt. MotoGP is one of those sports!! Great commentary as well as good insight. Well worth a look.

B0036BK6MW|4.0|From the first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. This movie is inspiring, uplifting and very touching. It depicts the difference someone can make in another's life by just showing a little kindness.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I didn't read the book first, and I thinks that's why I was skeptical about this movie, because I heard such mixed reviews from people that had read the book (didn't like it) and people that hadn't (liked it). So i was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved this movie!
B001B6PBBK|2.0|A CLEVERLY produced film that lacks wit humor and interesting characters. Acting is very flat and the viewer is not involved with characters.
B004AQR29C|5.0|After alot of mixed reviews we decided to watch this and it was really, really good.  For a bunch of &#34;older&#34; our age and above guys they really put on a good show,  and did it well.  Anyone can watch this and pt 1 and pt 2 are both great
B00DULWFZE|5.0|I just have to say WOW... I found myself a little in tears when I heard the entire thing. I was scared that I wouldn't like the songs or something but I was not dissapointed! This is amazing! and I think it's the first time I actually hear an album and like absolutely every song! The songs are very catchy and the lyrics are so good. Hope this albums does great because it is SO worth it!
B00433C73S|3.0|I had not heard of this band until recently, but as soon as I heard it I could tell the time period that it was written. It's a nice mix of classical and rock.
B00005JOA0|4.0|This series is a little mysterious for me, I liked it, I think!! I enjoy the period of the piece, but was a little surprised during the entire story. This story is by Anne Bronte, I should have guessed being familiar with Charlotte and Emily Bronte that Anne could hang in there with her famous sisters. Thanks, Jane
B004IM14RY|2.0|A lot of hype for nothing.  Just not my kind of movie or ending. Reminded me too much of that awful Colin Farell movie &#34;phone booth&#34;.  Can I please have the hour and half of my life back?

0385737955|1.0|****WARNING - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS****<br /><br />I'm generally a big fan of YA fiction. I've enjoyed Harry Potter, Chaos Walking, The Hunger Games, and the Divergent series, but this book was truly terrible. To discuss all the things that were wrong with this book would take far too long, but suffice it to say that there was so little character develop (and those that were developed frequently acted outside of their character's established personality) that I honestly didn't care whether any of them lived or died. The only read I kept reading was to try to figure out what was going on in this book, since the reader, like the main character Thomas, is intentionally given so little information and told only what is convenient for the plot that I had no understanding of what was going on.<br /><br />Further, it seems like the plot is so superficially advanced, rather than logically flowing to a natural confusion.  Both Thomas and his female counterpart, Theresa (the only female character in the book and so flat and dull I forgot she was there most of the time) helped build the maze and are apparently involved with WICKED, but remember only what is necessary to advance the plot without explain what's happening.  The characters are terrified of being stung by these monsters, the \\"Greivers,\\" for fear of harm or death, but rather than either occurring, those who are stung have their memories returned with little to no lasting consequence.  However, once again the characters remember only what is necessary to advance the plot and not enough to explain anything that has happened. Next, the characters have been stuck in this maze for TWO YEARS, but Thomas single-handedly figures out how to solve the maze in a matter of days, and all of the characters in the Glade, most of whom we never even meet, are more than happy to let him take control and just do it, even after he tells them that he was involved in the making of the maze. Finally, the book ends with one of themain characters, who up until that point had been described as a coward, sacrifices himself to save Thomas after he is attacked with literally no provocation by a character that died 20 chapters ago.  The whole book is so ridiculous, its amazing that YA readers are even able to follow what's happening.<br /><br />While I understand that YA books are more simple than their adult counterparts, that doesn't mean that it's acceptable for them to be so poorly written. Dascher feels the need to blatantly state every feeling and every action that happens to every character in the book and uses Dues Ex Machina to almost no end. I picked up this book thinking it would be a tense, dystopian thriller, but I was bored almost from the get go. Please, please PLEASE don't read this book. There's so much other YA dystopian fiction that's well written, interesting, and makes sense.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome!  please make more levels.  I cannot get enough.  great mind teaser.  give me more!!!!  ill definitely check out your other apps
B000OVLBFS|5.0|the Jesse Stone series is great.  Mr Parker writes so that you can love a drunk, womanizing man and even empathize with him be Jesse Stone
B00A7CI82I|4.0|In keeping with the earlier movies, this one is fast paced and exciting.  It would have been nice to at least had a cameo of &#34;Jason&#34;.
B000HSKUBE|3.0|interesting but on the slow side like some British shows that is all I have to say short and to the point
B000R8YC18|4.0|DeNiro, Shepard, Foster, and Keitel in a gritty story of lonliness and redemption. Martin Scorcese(also acts a small role),<br />in one of his earliest works as a director, captures perfectly the lonliness and despair of street life in NYC. Jodie Foster,<br />as a teen prostitute, is worthy of our sympathy. Harvey Keitel, as her pimp, is well cast for this role. Travis Bickell,<br />played by DeNiro is authentic as the spurned admirer of Cybil Shepard . Travis becomes the hero in the violent<br />conclusion of this story. A classic, timeless film....
B008YAPRPG|4.0|A fantastic film that looks spectacular on BluRay.  This is the version that hews more closely to the films original color (as opposed to the 2009 version).  Still one of the great police procedurals ever made, with one of the most spectacular car chases ever shot.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Joe B may be the best blues man around these days. This is his first blues album and believe me he was wise to leave Rock and Roll behind. Keepin' the blues alive....if you get a chance to see him in person don't miss it.
B000GWE44U|5.0|One of the best Jack Nicholson movies of all time.  This is a classic that everyone must see. Jack really brought his character to life.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|absolutely love this app, helped me so much. For awhile I could hardly download anything deleted apps, books, everything but my internal storage was still showing almost full. this app fixed it clean the cache and instantly it was dramatically down. I was so freaking happy. keeping this app around for sure
B001EC2J20|4.0|it was just OK as a re-make but not as good as the original. Special effects were worth watching. It's worth $3 for an evening at home.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved it the first time I saw it and wanted to add it to my collection of memorable movies.<br />Wanted to see it again because it has so many life lessons.
B004IDG97S|4.0|Pretty good movie made toward the end of Stallone's career. It's worth the $3 price tag. My 9 year old son picked it out and really enjoyed it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|WOW...... Emma Chase has delivered an awesome book with just the right mixture of sass sex and funny as sin tangled together to bring you a love story of a different kind. It's brilliant, if you liked Wallbanger you will love Tangled.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|the car chase at the beginning of the movie was very exciting and dramatic.  Daniel Craig did a good job as James Bond
B003FZ9AR6|5.0|This movie is an under-the-radar gem; a very non-Hollywood, non-formula story of people dealing with their family's past. Very funny and very touching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game for horse lovers. This games gives you a real feel as to how it is to own your very own horse ranch and take part in competitions.
B005KELR3A|4.0|I bought the sleeve to help protect my Kindle Touch, and a good thing I did. I dropped it. Not far, not hard, but enough to remind me that I was glad to have it. The sleeve did a wonderful job of protecting my device.<br /><br />The only thing I'm not so crazy about is how snug the sleeve is. So snug that zipping is difficult and tends to scrape the edges of my device. So I don't even attempt to zip it closed any longer.
B00BD62X14|5.0|I bought 2 one for me, one for my daughter; we both love it. One of the most soothing CD's I 've ever had.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I listened to this as an audio book though I bought it for my kindle first.<br />What a great story, and to be honest it was not one I thought I would like. It seemed more like a guy thing with all the technical details, however I was enthralled and amazed and thought it was a very believable story. While there have been tons of positive reviews of this book I felt that it deserved another one<br />The audio version is excellent by the way, and having the whisper-net aspect allowed me to reread easily some of the more detailed accounts of this adventure.
B007I1Q4W2|2.0|Acting was amateurish, villains were wimpy, zombies were ho hum. Not what I was expecting after reading other reviews. Waste of time
B0066W1AZK|5.0|My boys are getting better and better at chess with this app.  It has levels as you build your playing skill which they love!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy play this game it challenges you but it's not to hard. I am looking forward to the update and added levels.
B00004XQ83|5.0|We loved the movie and especially the song &#34;I am a man..&#34;. The soundtrack contains the Emmy award winning performance of the Soggy Bottom Boys.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I used the free version for a while and found it very useful.  Because it was such an excellent app I decided to buy it.  I use it all the time and would highly recommend it. Well done to the developers.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Fantastic book! You get a feel for the technical brilliance of this country and of the people who contributed to the technical might of the US.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I never really tried out the product so I cannot really rate it.  looked to be interesting but never really grabbed me
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Not as good as the first season but pretty awesome for a sophomore season.  Didn't even know this was on t.v. And now I'm somewhat obsessed!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Entertaining and reasonably true to the book version. Due to time constraints, it leaves out a few things but does a good job of conveying the authors intent.
B005544V6A|5.0|I never write reviews but I am loving this series. Definitely start with season one and go forward. This explains the back story and introduces all the key players.
0425263916|1.0|Steamy sex scenes told over and over and over again.  Not much to move the reader to turn the page unless the reader loves to read about a couple having sex.  The crux of the story is told in the last 25 pages and it was anticlimactic.  I will not read this author again.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I heard about it and enjoyed the commentary about life. Rachel's choice of language made me savor each page.  Worth reading.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This one is about as simple as it gets. Assuming you let your Kindle detect where you are, when you open the app, you get the current temperature and conditions. You can also look at the forecast for the next week. Nothing mindblowing, but definitely delivered on my expectations.
B004BSAEQC|5.0|I really enjoy many og the songs.  They get better with time,  songs like Moment 4 Life. The feature artists did well.
B00E6D4HHO|5.0|This isn't even out yet and I can tell that it is going to be great.  If you don't own any of the X-Men movies like me than this is great.  If you do own them you can get it anyway!  I loved all of the X-Men movies.  My favourite so far is the newest one, The Wolverine.  Thank you Marvel for releasing such a cool box set with a very cool collectable claw.  Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I didn't really get to play this game.  It crashed my Kindle and I couldn't get to restart for hours. The Kindle needs a restart ability.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|To say that movie is great it means nothing. This movie deserves to be watched and to be loved. Great movie and defienetly lasts for many generations.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Been playing this for over 6 months. Have made loads of friends, and tons of fun. Also learnt things about places around the World as I've collected prizes during bingo rounds.
B001VNB54A|2.0|Unlike Band of Brothers with its true story about American hero's and good writing, this series has no redeeming values at all. Way too much use of vulgarity, constant sex scenes and characters that seem to hate America, themselves and others around them. Half way thru and you still don't know who they are, they all look and sound alike. Will not watch a second time and will probably throw in trash. Save your money
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very interesting and exciting book. It is such a original idea to go back in time and stop JFK from being assassinated. Would things be better or worse?
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Multiple timers that can be used simultaneously! I adore this app, and use it every day for cooking. Five stars!
B002APU580|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie very engaging. I was very happy to be able to see it with out any interruptions like on cable.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Purchased as a gift for Dad. This is one of his favorite movies. He was pleased. It was a great gift idea.
B006LSZECO|2.0|From start to finish this book was boring and I could figure out how it would end after a few chapters.  Guess it just wasn't a story<br />that I could relate to and just found to be a waste of my time.  The characters were just plan stupid.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Great series! Start from the beginning and &#34;Don't Blink&#34;! Great for all science fiction lovers. Just who really is Dr. Who!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a touching novel, one that keeps you glued to its pages. A book that puts life into perspective and makes you appreciate the little things.
B000FCK8ZK|1.0|I am a huge fan of the Dexter series on Showtime.  Knowing how &#34;the book is always better&#34; I was expecting a wonderful book. What I got instead was flat, unlikeable characters.  I do not plan on reading the rest of the series.
0307716554|5.0|This author is incredible--I don't know why we haven't heard more about her.  She is one of today's best writers and her story line keeps you involved and guessing through the whole book.  You can't put it down.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is an excellent book for Book Clubs.  It is well written and the subject matter is thought provoking.  It does not reach the depth or the intensity of Light Between Oceans, but the moral issue is as compelling. The ending certainly leaves you asking the question.....&#34;what would I have done?&#34;
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|Lots of boom, bang, but not much story. Background of cast weak and Arnold is just getting old. :-)<br />Bill in Las Vegas<br />&#60;&#62;&#60;
B005LAIIPS|4.0|It was an interesting follow-up to the other Bourne movies. I didn't find it as fast paced and intriguing as the others.
B005LAII4E|3.0|I watched the 1st movie. The first movie had cool vehicles powered by fusion or something and energy weapons. Where were they in this one? There were just plain helicopters, tanks, boats and weapons that shot...bullets. Firefly had the cool, remote controlled fireflies that exploded, and there was one...1, remote controlled camera bullet. That was it. In the first movie, Cobra had a cool, underwater Arctic base. This one, an old abandoned factory. It was like the budget was cut in 1/2.
