0553579908|5.0|I just finished this book and it was awesome.  I love the way he writes from different characters' point of views.  It is like reading ten different books at the same time.  Also, R.r. puts so much twist and turns to the story, you are hooked from the first page.  <br />In this book, no one is safe from death.  Just expect someone unexpected to die.  Also, there are so many lies and double crossing going on, you can't tell what will happen next.  Hell, I don't even have a favorite character in the book.  He might die or turn out to be a traitor. <br />Either way you look at it, this is a very entertaining book.  I recommend this series to anyone who like reading.  I hope this helped!  On to Book Number 3!!!
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is the tale of a love that should never have occurred...one which could only bring heartbreak, anger, and disaster to the two lovers.  And yet, from their first meeting, they are foredoomed.  Helpless, they grasp for a moment's passion, and are ultimately destroyed. <br /> <br />Incidentally, I'm not talking about \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"...I'm referring to \\"Romeo and Juliette\\".  <br />
6305882592|5.0|This is one of the most life-affirming films ever made.  I've seen the movie as a teenager, as a mother of sons, and, now, as one who has just reached middle age.  The movie speaks in different ways to each phase of a person's life, but in all cases it shows us how to live a life that is vibrant under any circumstances.<br /><br />Harold is obsessed with death. In a story Harold tells Maude, Harold once had a devastating experience with a science experiment in school and authorities thought he was dead.  His mother was mistakingly told he was dead, causing her to express authentic grief.  Therefore, Harold tries to recreate his death through mock suicide attempts in order to recapture the moment his mother expressed genuine love for him.  Harold's obsession with death is also metaphorical, portraying his lack of connection to what it means to feel alive.<br /><br />Maude is the conduit through which Harold discovers this connection.  She shows him how to live.  In response, Harold falls desperately in love with her.  When Maude dies, he is released from his obsession with death and in contrast becomes engaged with life.<br /><br />All of this may sound rather corney, but it's not.  The acting is first-rate and the movie isn't afraid to delve philosophically into the main theme, such as when Harold recognizes the Holocaust tattoo on Maude's arm and she reveals her wonder at the seagulls.  Maude tells Harold of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish soldier wrongfully incarcerated on Devil's Island, who as a child felt amazement when he first encountered seagulls.  Later, he realized they were \\"only seagulls.\\"  This is the challenge of life:  to keep one's initial wonderment.<br /><br />This is the gift Maude gives to Harold.  The movie is timeless and moving and one of the best to come out of that golden non-conformist era in movie-making between 1967 and 1975.
B000002G87|5.0|The best song on the LP would be Key to the Highway. It's Clapton at his bluesiest and best, plus he trades awesome solos with Duane Allman. Don't be scared off by it's 9:37 length, it's essential Clapton listening, not to mention a must-hear for anyone studying the guitar. Possibly Clapton's greatest song, ever, counting what he did with Cream and Blind Faith. Just had to get that out of the way.<br /><br />Besides Key to the Highway, Layla is loaded with gems and one of the best double-albums ever. If you want the song-by-song breakdown, here we go...<br /><br />1. I Looked Away: 7/10. Emotional vocals, but doesn't quite do it for me.<br /><br />2. Bell Bottom Blues: 10/10. Amazing guitar solo, but even that pales in comparison to Clapton's gut-wrenching vocals.<br /><br />3. Keep On Growing: 10/10. Great high-energy jam, with nice soloing from Clapton and Allman.<br /><br />4. Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out: 10/10. Again, great vocals from Eric. Nice reading of this age-old blues standard.<br /><br />5. I Am Yours: 6/10. The weakest track on the album, it isn't bad but it sounds like a CSN ripoff. (I do like CSN, though).<br /><br />6. Anyday: 9.5/10. A great, energetic-yet-downcast tune. Only problem is Clapton's falsetto.<br /><br />7. Key to the Highway: 10/10. I wrote a whole paragraph praising this one. It's gotta be good. Forgot to mention that I love Duane's slide.<br /><br />8. Tell the Truth: 8/10. Solid, but not the best.<br /><br />9. Why's Love Got to Be So Sad: 8/10. Again, it's really good, but there are better songs here.<br /><br />10. Have You Ever Loved a Woman: 10/10. Whoa!!! Nobody can play the blues like Clapton, let's face it. Even though it was a cover, you could've fooled me into thinking it was an original. Perfect for Eric's mood, especially with the whole Patti Boyd thing. Second-best song.<br /><br />11. Little Wing: 10/10. I always loved Hendrix's, but this is worlds different. A very good jam version, and another favorite of mine.<br /><br />12. It's Too Late: 10/10. What can I say? Great song.<br /><br />13. Layla: 10/10. The album's other classic (first being Bell Bottom Blues) starts off as a metal-ish rocker helped by Duane's high-pitched, haunting slide parts and ends with a lovely piano solo from drummer Bobby Whitlock.<br /><br />14. Thorn Tree in the Garden: 7.5/10. Nice way to close a great album.<br /><br />Overall: 9/10. Yeah, you really should own this album if you don't already. It's one of the greatest double-albums of all time.at song. <br />13. Layla: 10/10. The album's other classic (first being Bell Bottom Blues) starts off as a metal-ish rocker helped by Duane's high-pitched, haunting slide parts and ends with a lovely piano solo from drummer Bobby Whitlock. <br />14.

B00004XOWM|4.0|This is probably my fave limps cd.yeah i know all these people are whineing about it saying they dont like it.well im sure most of the people reveiwing it are old probably in there 40s and still live at home in moms basement listening to old skynard trying to relive there hey days. rap and metal is in get a clue people.anyways the cd kicks major.id buy it.and if the cd is so bad why did it sell 3 million copies enough about these old losers.Boiler,,My Way,,,Rollin.were all number one videos on mtv TRL. huge album buy it !!
B000002UWW|2.0|You know a few days ago I had a chili peppers revelation.  I didn't own any of their CDs, however I remembered how catchy the album \\"Californiacation\\" sounded when I went over to my friends houses and I remember also lovin' \\"under the bridge.\\"  I noticed that there was the highly priced greatest hits compilation, and then there as the below 10 dollars \\"amazon 5 star\\" rated \\"What Hits?!\\"  I bought it with the intent of hearing a lot of songs like under the bridge.  That song is on black sugar sex maghik, and not being an avid fan yet, I thought it would be less risky buying the best of collection. I love funk.  The peppers are very original (when they aren't  giving 5 covers) Most songs are from tyhe 80's and though  remotely catchy, I wasn't able to latch on and enjoy it.  Avid fans will probably love this - most songs charted.  But fans familiar with californiacation and newer stuff will consider this fluff.
B000EE8M52|5.0|The greatest collection of the DIRE STRAITS. Dolby Surround Sound. Everyone Must have ! Highly Recommend!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I have to admit that at first I was utterly disgusted by the sounds that were portruding from my stereo system. I thought to myself, \\"I wasted $700 on awesome speakers to listen to this?\\" I tried to listen to it. In all honesty, I did. And I found myself turning it off after I listened to \\"Juicebox.\\" But the more I listened to it, the more I loved it. Oh my dearest Jesus. This album has to be the greatest thing I have EVER heard. I cannot believe I thought this of the beautiful Julian and Gang. The guitar riffs soar and are pumped with young energy that it makes me antsy and glad. This is just too good to be true. The more you listen to this album, the more it grows on you. I won't let it leave my premises. I'm glad that the Strokes are back with this powerful and intelligent 3rd album. I've got nothing to say.
B00000GAIW|3.0|--than their other remasters. Great album, but sound technology must have improved drastically from 1999 to 2003. Witness the Yes rems. from that year. Why don't they try again and get it up to speed? I suppose all there is now is the Japanese remaster for a very good recording on CD.
B00007CVSH|4.0|Il Trovatore has a wild quality to it with its firelight nighttime settings, its revenge theme, its intense characters. I love how the opera often feels out of control even though, of course, the performers can't be. And that's why this is such a good production. The four leads attack their parts with passion, while exhibiting (for the most part) the control that Verdi requires of his singers.<br /><br />The two stand-out performances are by Yvonne Naef and Dmitri Hvorostovsky. Naef is moving as Azucena, partly because she doesn't play her as crazed beyond belief. As a result, we can identify with her suffering. I love the clarity of her voice and the freshness of her acting. The audience's enthusiastic response to her is well-deserved. Hvorostovsky is charismatic as Count di Luna and possesses a truly great baritone voice -- rich and full and burnished.<br /><br />Veronica Villaroel struggles at times with the vocal requirements of Leonora, particularly with the coloratura and the faster musical passages. But she's emotionally convincing as Leonora. As Manrico, Jose Cura's voice is rough around the edges (but then, Manrico is rough around the edges). Like Villaroel, Cura makes up for his vocal struggles by delivering a passionate acting performance, convincingly portraying the great range required for the role: loving son, warrior, spurned lover, grieving man.<br /><br />The four leads put everything they've got into their roles and the high energy level that results keeps the viewer engaged from beginning to end. One example: While Villaroel's voice soars above them, Cura and Hvorostovsky engage in an intense sword fight as they sing \\"Di geloso amor spezzato,\\" the trio that closes Act I. Usually the players lock swords for a few seconds once they've finished singing and the applause has started. Not this group of players. They perform Il Trovatore with the wild abandon that befits this opera. I highly recommend it.
B000002BBY|4.0|I was very impressed with Definitely Maybe,just some good rock and roll music played loud with some great hooks and great melodies.Then 1994 rolls around and I heard Wonderwall....I was speachless,really taken aback by this great song.Getting Morning Glory and listening to it from front to back was indeed a great experience,so many great songs and finishing up with the very beautiful Champange Supernova. <br />Years go by and I hear Wonderwall again on the radio and whenever I hear this song,I have to sit back and listen....comparing in a song your feelings for a girl to your feelings for your favorite album struck a huge chord with me and for that alone I give Noel a tip of the cap.Great rock and roll by a great rock and roll band.
B000EMGAGW|1.0|Whoah! The release of two singles, a video to generate the buzz, teaming with beat heavy G-Unit - oh, that was the hollow bullet.  They are about making money, music is secondary.  This album sounds like the Mobb put thier energy into creating a bunch of singles for mass radio release, strung them together and called it an album.  There is no center, no core that connect each of the tracks.  Seriously fellas, this many albums deep and your still talking about robbing people, selling drugs, sexin women and P throws knives at God. What?  Where are the coarse lyrics?  Where's the H.N.I.C.?  Think on this for a minute, the track Capital P, Capital H. P and Hav toss one verse each (pitiful at that, but thats not the point for this one).  Then, just check the track time when Hav finishes his verse, 1:24 left.  There's another verse coming right? Hell no, you got the cheerleader screamin on the track, for over 1minute and 24seconds.  This is formula mainstream rap- not rap music.  <br />Talk about commidification of rap, this is a prime example.  This is truly disposable music, it won't linger in your thoughts, there is no mental work involved in unpacking meaning to the tracks or a larger concept.  A bunch of thirty somethin' rich men that regurgitate the sameness, the ethos of the strugglin' ghetto kid who has no other option but to kill and destroy whats around him all the while continuing the cycle of violence and poverty - no uplifting messages in this one.   <br />For Hip-hop to live as hip-hop, its time to go back to the root and evolve this medium to its most dangerous form - the form that speaks truth through rythmn. Sometimes its violent, sometimes its love, but its honest.  Its Hell on Earth, its The Infamous Mobb Deep, its Up North Trip -  <br />This,, what they call Blood Money is exactly that.  My and other loyal fans spending hard earned cash to vibe with a group that we trust - only to be let down by the them, the G-Unit rap destroying machine and Hip-hop.<br />The shame is really on us who purchased this commodified B.S. - go spend that $11.99 on any other than this poor excuse for an album.   <br /> <br />Peace-
B000EULJLU|3.0|I'm not going to sit here and write a thesis about the new Tool album like so many others have done. Every person is different in what he or she likes or looks for in music. It's not right to say something is bad or good just because you think so. Keeping that in mind, and also keeping in mind that I am a huge Tool fan, here is my review.    At first this album comes across as really confusing and annoying. Fast forwarding through entire tracks and/or portions of songs just to get to when the drums finally kick in. Lots of buildup, very progressive. There are six actual songs on 10,000 Days and five filler soundscapes, which really annoys me. If you have five years to make an album and you want to include that many soundscapes, release a double CD and come up with a few more songs or even some live tracks. I shouldn't have to skip over half the tracks just to get to some music.    So, that being said, at first I absolutely hated this album. Then I started to just program in the six actual songs and I realized that most of them are quite good Tool songs. My only major gripe is that they are all so long, but not in a good way. If you ever listened to the audio CD that came with the DVD Tool relased a few years ago, there is a version of Push It that is really long and drawn out. That is exactly what these tracks are, long and drawn out. The only difference is that the songs on 10,000 Days NEVER CLIMAX< EVER!    I especially love Vicarious, I think that song kicks some major ass. Other reviewers are right when they say old riffs are re-used. This is true. There are parts that are taken directly from Third Eye. I guess its ok to steal from yourself, but it shows how little effort was put into making this album. Here are my song reviews:    Vicarious 10/10 Great song, like it better than almost every song on Laterlus too  Jambi 8/10 Great second track for the album, keeps your interest. Crazy drumming.  10,000 Days 7/10 Long and boring progressive Tool, never climaxes  The Pot 9/10 Sounds the most like old-school Tool, great tune  Rosetta Stoned 7.5/10 Good song, but reused riffs, again song structure is very confusing.  Right in Two 9.5/10 Great song, but takes a while to build-up    Now that I have listened to the album a dozen or so times, it has really grown on me. Although it is still a dissapointment, it is where you would expect Tool to go from Lateralus. The days of Opiate and Undertow are long gone. Tool has matured and their song structures have changed. Some may hate it, some may love it. In my opinion, Tool reached their apex on the Aenima CD. That CD is a real masterpiece, it is ia perfect combination of Lateralus and Undertow.    On a whole, I believe little effort was put forth when making this album. Re-used riffs, confusing song structure, lack or emotional highs, and worthless soundscapes all support this theory. Obviously the playing is top-notch, as well as the production. I love progressive music just as much as the next guy, but the music must progress SOMEWHERE, which many of these Tool tracks do not. That's why so many people are giving it a bad review.    In closing, 10,000 Days is 10,000 times better than all the other garbage that is out there today. However, when measured against Tool themselves, this album is MUCH more forgettable than Opiate, Undertow, Aenima, and Laterlus.    PS: Anyone who thinks this album sounds like A Perfect Circle doesn't know what they're talking about. From the moment you pop in the CD you know that it is TOOL all the way.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This CD is excellent. People have been saying that this CD was the worst CD ever. I'm glad that I don't listen to people who judge albums based off leaks. This CD has the most creative and best coverart I have ever seen. Definitely look through those eyepieces to see those images.  <br />Just remember, this isn't the first Tool CD to contain fillers. They all do. <br /> <br />1) Vicarious - 5/5 <br />1st single off the album. Definitely sounds similar to \\"Schism\\". One of the best tracks off the album. One of the fastest paced songs off the album. I love how this song sounds like \\"schism\\" since I couldn't get enough of it. <br /> <br />2) Jambi - 5/5 <br />This will probably be there second single. The first two songs remind me of the Lateralus album. <br /> <br />3) Wings For Marie (Pt. 1) - 3/5 <br />Not a great song by all means. Definitely a good intro for the second part of the song. This one takes awhile to build up. This is probably the slowest actual song on this album. <br /> <br />4) 10,000 Days - 5/5 <br />Much better than the first part. This is obviously about his mother who was ill for 27 years which is close to 10,000 days.  <br /> <br />5) The Pot - 5/5 <br />MJK's voice starts off different in this song. People say this song has nothing symbolic to the drug (pot). But why does he say \\"You musta been high\\" in the song then. That's definitely a reference. Another great song off the album. <br /> <br />6) Lipan Conjuring - 1/5 <br />Skip. Boring. Filler. <br /> <br />7) Lost Keys - 1/5 <br />Quite boring. Just a patient and a doctor interacting. The only purpose of this song imo is that it is an intro for Rosetta Stone. Basically you can skip it. <br /> <br />8) Rosetta Stone - 5/5 <br />Probably my favorite track off the album. The lyrics on this are strange and hard to understand. A very fast pace song that will take many listens to understand what is said. <br /> <br />9) Intension - 1/5 <br />Skip. Filler. <br /> <br />10) Right In Two - 5/5 <br />Another great song. Definitely feels like a song off from their album Aenima.  <br /> <br />11) Viginiti Tres - 1/5 <br />Dont even bother going to this track. Another filler. <br /> <br />Overall a very strong CD. This CD has 6 great songs which makes it definitely worth the purchase. Hopefully it won't take another 5 years to release a CD.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is a ridiculous band. They are amazing musicians, and Maynard has revealed a more introspective side of Tool (similar to the side we've seen in A Perfect Circle). This album may piss off people who consider themselves Tool Fans, thoes people who hold AEnima and Lateralus amidst \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" as some of the greatest albums ever written. Personally, i find \\"10,000 Days\\" to be just as good as Lateralus and AEnima, though is very very different. <br /> <br />The album really centers around the two 16+ minute multi-part epics. The first, Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days, is about maynard coping with his mother's death. It is an amazing and haunting song, and leaves you breathless. It alludes to Tools past masterpieces including the song \\"Eulogy\\". The second epic, including Lipan Conjuring, Lost Keys (Blame Hoffmann), and Roseta Stoned centers around the LSD induced paranoid schitzo-psychosis of some poor man trapped in an Asylum. It is absolutely chaotic, horrifing, and powerfull all at once. Very similar to \\"Third Eye\\" and maybe even more powerful.  <br /> <br />The other key songs on the album, Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot, Intension, and Right in Two all stand out. The first three are heavy, vintage Tool, and all are perfectly crafted. The latter two are much softer, with Intension relating mostly towards Disposition from Lateralus, and Right in Two (being the emotional climax of the album) sounds similar to Lateralis. Viginti Tres is  a segue, shocking, and frightening, but not as good as Fiaap de Oiad off Lateralus. It sounds as if they sampled the voice of \\"Dormin\\" from the videogame \\"Shadow of the Collossus\\". <br /> <br />All in all, this album is magnificant, and will hopefully gain ledgendary status like is predecassors, though i fear it will not be as respected by Tool fans as it should be.
B00005JOUM|5.0|This is going to be (for me) a brief review for the simple reason that without delving into the content of the film I find it hard to write about except in the most glittering of generalities.  And this really is a film that would be more enjoyable the less one knows about it.  So let me cut to the chase if you haven't seen this but are tempted:  it will be worth your time.<br /><br />This is not at all your typical Spike Lee film.  In almost all of his films, Lee has been concerned to make a social statement of sorts, and while I am completely in sympathy with his social and political beliefs, they have sometimes lessened the films as vehicles for telling stories (though DO THE RIGHT THING was made even better by the message, being one of the best political films ever made in America).  The point here is to tell a great yarn and there is little question the film succeeds wonderfully.<br /><br />All I'll say about the content of the film is that it involves a bank robbery and hostage situation.  Comparisons to DOG DAY AFTERNOON utterly miss the point of the film.  If you are thinking, \\"DOG DAY AFTERNOON\\" you are in the wrong frame of mind.  It is a film in which nothing is what it seems.  And even in saying that I've said too much, so let me just usher another encouragement to see the film and hand out some kudos.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is, well, Denzel Washington.  He is one of the finest actors of his generation and while this is not one of his best performances, it is one of his typical ones.  Clive Owen is spectacular as the head of the group taking over the bank.  He is an enormously gifted performer and ever since seeing him in THE CROUPIER I have been waiting to see his career explode.  He has one of the great gazes in the movies, and one of those performers who seems to glide between being congenial to utterly threatening in a matter of seconds.  Jodie Foster is a great actress, but though she is enormously competent in her part, it really isn't one designed to let her shine.  Likewise, Willem Dafoe is a frequently compelling actor, but he is largely on the sidelines in this one.  Ditto the amazing Chiwetel Ejiofor, a handsome and extremely talented English actor of Nigerian parentage who I believe is only a role or two away from stardom.  He is appealing here as Washington's partner, but he isn't given any opportunity to show what he can doe.  For a better sense of his talent, check out his work in DIRTY PRETTY THINGS or his turn as a true believing assassin in the Sci-fi gem SERENITY.<br /><br />The real star of the film, however, is not Spike Lee or any of his actors.  It is writer Russell Gewirtz, who with this script makes his screen debut.  This is a wonderfully constructed, deliciously complex script.  It results in one of those movies you love to pry apart and dissect afterwards, to see if it makes as much sense afterwards as it did when you were watching it.  The rumor is that Ron Howard was going to direct this originally, but pulled out in favor of directing CINDERELLA MAN.  With no disrespect to either Howard or Lee, my guess is that the original script was so good that it would have been difficult to make a bad movie out of it.<br /><br />So far 2006 has looked like another slow movie year, though there is plenty of time for that to turn around.  Although for most of my adult life I have seen roughly 300-450 movies a year (one year I saw 600, with nearly daily double headers on the VCR), in recent years I have shifted my attention more and more towards TV, the best TV shows being better, in my opinion, than the vast majority of films.  This is not a film that will win any awards, but it a thoroughly entertaining film that I hope will be a prelude to better things to come out of Hollywood this year.one designed to let her shine.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I have had this movie for only one day, and I've watched it three times. It brings some closure for fans of the game, but people who haven't played the game can enjoy it too.  The Cinematography is amazing, and beautiful. The music is enjoyable, too. The fight scenes are intense. I'll never get sick of this movie.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|For the most part, Peter Jackson's King Kong is a fantastic thrill ride. The action sequences on Skull Island are some of the best I've ever seen, particularly the Kong Vs. T-Rex battle. Also, the scenes of Kong in New York are great. Naomi Watts really makes you believe that she's acting with an actual ape and she has some affection for him in spite of the circumstances. (I especially like Kong and her \\"skating\\" in Central Park.) <br /> <br />But Peter... <br /> <br />That first hour... <br /> <br />Goes.... <br /> <br />So... <br /> <br />SLOWLY! <br /> <br />Bogged down in exposition we don't need about Carl Denham and Screenwriter Jack and the other actors in Carl's movie and the expendable sailors... <br /> <br />The original movie spent about 15 minutes on ship before finding Kong. <br /> <br />GET TO THE ISLAND ALREADY!! <br /> <br />So, even though the DVD doesn't give you the full cinematic experience, it is an improvement on the movie as you can zip past the dull first hour and get right onto the island. <br /> <br />One other thing. I was hoping that Peter Jackson would tell us how in the world they got Kong _back_ to New York in the first place. How did they get him on board? What did they restrain him with? Did they just gas him up the whole time? An hour ont he Jack & Anne drippy romance, but not five minutes on this?
B000A1ENCU|5.0|Outstanding movie, but be forewarned the sound in the Taiwanese DVD plays in mono only which takes away from what would otherwise be a sublime experience. Still it is a classic with a message that we sorely need to be reminded of (and which you have to go out of your way to hear nowadays).    What on earth are the folks in Hollywood waiting for to release a remastered version of this cinematic milestone?
B000305ZS4|5.0|This is probably one of black metal's finest bands. This album also stands as one of the best black metal albums ever made, from the haunting keyboard melodies to the incredible cover art, everything about this album is superb.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I heard so much about this movie from its original release in theaters to the Oscars, and now the DVD version.  <br /> <br />I rent the DVD with no expectations. I was really impressed with both the actors and the story setting. It is such a different vision of homosexuality. This movie shows the power of passion like anyone did before. <br /> <br />Touching, great actors, beautiful landscapes part of the poetic dialogues, a must see ! It may change your opinion on a couple of things...
B0000048CP|5.0|not much to say about this aside from its a great album and you need it
B00005JOEA|5.0|I liked it.  Even my cousons who don't like a lot of the same movies as me liked it. It is a must see movie.
B000305912|3.0|i am not a big guy on quality of albums, and it usually doesnt bother me. however, with this one, i cant even listen to it, its just in my collection for the hell of it. the wrath of the tyrant demo (or first 4 songs) are actually pretty good, but nothing special.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Every track here is just ...perfect, I couldn't find any flaws with it.Great Stuff if you liked Dani California your gonna love this whole album. <br /> <br />My Favoirte Songs  <br /> <br />Hard to Concertate  <br />Animal Bar <br />Come on girl <br />shes only 18  <br />hey  <br />esphaichly in mahicgan <br />death of a martian <br />snow <br />Dani California <br />If <br />Hump de Bump <br />Charie  <br />Wet Sand
B000BMSTN2|1.0|Now I am not in love with this album to begin with, but when you have bleeped words or changed words it ruines the whole experience.<br /><br />What is the point of listening to an anti religion song like Hypocrites when there is bleeping in it?  The hell with clean versions of songs.
B000AA302U|5.0|I notice that the persons who dislike the last 2-3 Jamiroquai releases & compare it to their first 3 releases, are usually the college hippy types.  Probably because their first 2-3 albums do tend to lean toward more jam band like music & college hippies seem to listen to nothing but.  It's still amazing stuff nonetheless & there's not a Jamiroquai album that I skip tracks when listening to.   I think the acoustic tracks on Funk Odyssey challenged the Jamiroquai fans to open their mind up a bit. Synkronized & Dynamite would be considered the most commercially accesible albums. Unfortunately you still won't find them being played in clubs & on the radio in most areas of the US, which is a damn shame.   <br />I'm big on the concept of \\"old values with new ideas\\" & that's what Jamiroquai's music is all about in relation to the FUNK.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|First off, like many other real Korn fans, this is my least favorite Korn album, and unless they do this again, it will stay that way.  There are a lot of people saying that Korn is washed up and selling out, but I don't buy that.  Just 2 and a half years ago, they made Take a Look in The Mirror, and made hardly any money (which they weren't planning to, all of their concerts were in small time places, hence the Back To Basics tour name) and came out with the anti-record company song Y'all Want A Single, so I wouldn't say they were sell-outs.  As for being washed up, that depends on what they come out with next.  If they do a record anything like this again, I will still buy it, but I won't be as easy on them.  From what the members have been saying, they plan on coming out with at least a few more records, and if they want to do that, they better keep changing their music, because, like Take A Look In The Mirror, they can't do a record too much like this again.  Lets face it, they are not in their prime anymore, and to be honest, I don't know how much they have left in them.  They all said that all their demons are pretty much excorcised, and now that the pain and hate is gone, I don't know what they are planning on doing next.  Don't let the cover for the album fool you, this is not really a dark or heavy album, its more a celebration of life, or, to be more specific, sex.  Most of their albums have had a perv song or two on them, but they really go overboard on this record.  For example,  Twisted Transistor is apparently about a girl getting off with a radio(I am not so sure about that, I have read the lyrics and can't really decide, if so, it isn't blatant) Politics is about sleeping with your boss to get ahead, among other things, 10 or a Two Way is about a girl pleasuring herself, Getting Off is pretty self evident, don't you think?  Liar I think is about sleeping with a hooker, but I could be wrong.  Man!  Not that I mind, its just that it can become a little repetitive.  Another thing about not just this album, but Korn albums in general as of late; not since Issues has Korn come out with a really emotional album(Untouchables has deep stuff on it, and tries in places, but only has one song, Alone I Break on it that is really emotional, the voice synthesizers and subdued guitars on it just make it all sound too phony)  Take A Look In The Mirror wasn't trying to be emotional, and that was fine, but if Korn stops coming out with emotional albums they might as well hang it up, because that is what they are all about.  The music on here is very industrial-sounding, which makes sense after Head found Jesus(gagging)so you aren't going to hear any guitar work like on Falling Away From Me, thats for sure.  There ARE a few guitar heavy songs on here, like Hypocrites, Coming Undone, and, my personal favorite, Liar.  But then you hear songs like Love Song, which is a very decent song, but the guitars are almost completely absent from it.  My opinion on this album has changed from utter disgust on first listen to gradual acceptance, to starting to actually appreciate the fact that they went in a different direction to stay relevant.  I waited awhile to write this review, to make sure about how I felt about it.  I am glad I did, because I still don't like it, but I would still like to hear their songs, nothings more satisfying than hearing a new Jonathan Davis scat.  So, for the hardcore Korn fans out there, try not to get hasty and throw this cd in the nearest trash (which was my first instinct) and instead try to appreciate the fact that they are trying to stay on the scene.  I just hope that they know when to hang it up, because I would hate to see their record tarnished by doing this again.  Now to the song ratings:<br /><br />1 Twisted Transistor: 8/10  Almost everyone who doesn't live in a hole has heard this song.  I actually didn't find it too catchy, but it makes up for that ten-fold in the video.  I have to say that the music video for this is the best one they ever did, and its flat-out hilarious.<br /><br />2 Politics:  7/10  The riffs here aren't too original, and no, this isn't about government politics.  Its about domestic ones, sleeping with your boss to get ahead, etc etc......  Not bad, but not great either.<br /><br />3 Hypocrites: 9/10  Second-best song on the album.  Yes, guys, this is a partial swing at Head.  Its a anti-religion song, and I have always had a soft place in my heart for those.  It was one of the songs on here that kept me listening to it the first time without breaking it or burning it or anything.  The guitars on here, while not being Falling Away From Me or Ball Tongue good, are still heavy and decent.  It talks about a few things, like people who go to church and condemn bands like Korn and others, then go home and get drunk or cheat on their wives.  It also deals with blind faith, I GOTTA DO IT BLIND!  Also, a little bit of trivia, it is Munky who yells HYPOCRITES! Before Jon goes into the chorus.<br /><br />4 Souvenir: 7/10  Not that great a song, I usually skip it, but it makes more sense once you look up the lyrics.<br /><br />5 10 or a 2 Way: 7/10  I have already gone over what this song is about, so I don't need to say any more.  The drums on here are really quite good on this song, as they are throughout most of the album.  Since Head's departure, David and Munky really took care of the slack.<br /><br />6 Throw Me Away: 8/10  This song is one of the reasons why I gave this album a 4 star rating.  I am not in love with this song too much, but its nice that every song sounds different, because I don't know if I would have been able to finish this album if it all sounded the same.  Korn really experimented on a few of the songs on here.  It is pretty evident what this song is about.  Jonathan pleads, don't let them throw me away.....  Shows they still want to be on the scene.<br /><br />7 Love Song: 8/10  This song grew on me, because I couldn't get over how awful the guitar was on here(or lack of it) there are some decent parts that Munky has on here, but most of it is just the same dull riff over and over, easily overshadowed by the drums and Jonathan.  As for Fieldy, his bass really isn't all that audible on this album, which is a first for him.  I love the part where its only Jonathan's voice on here.  For the record, this song is about the soldiers who have died out in Iraq or other parts of the world.  Example is \\"Love song for the dear departed, head stone, for the broken-hearted.<br /><br />8 Open Up: 9/10  This isn't one of my favorites on here, kind of in the upper middle, but its REALLY original.  I haven't heard this kind of song by Korn or any other band.  I can't really understand what some of the parts mean, but the whole song structure is really original.  Also, the part at the end, whether it was an interlude or not, where the song goes into a short bagpipe solo, then it goes acoustic, then Jonathan scats first slowly, then its speeded up electronically, is really cool.  It then goes immediately into.....<br /><br />9 Coming Undone: 8/10  I am not really in love with the singles that Korn has come out with so far, Twisted Transistor was all right, and this is fairly catchy, but it lacks originality.  The music video for this proves it, too.  It basically shows them coming undone, I don't know how else to put it, but it seems like something that another band would do, and Korn has really over-done the whole I-am-going-crazy thing.<br /><br />10 Getting Off: 7/10 I don't mind the perv thing, as I told you, but this song is just too repetitive.  The chorus is all right, but everything else about the song is just blah.<br /><br />11 Liar: 10/10  Compared to alot of other Korn songs this song sucks, but compared to every other song on here its a masterpiece. Maybe its just me craving the heavy guitars and scatting.  But this song has everything a classic Korn song should: Heavy guitars, includinga few weird experimenting on Munky's part, Jonathan scatting, references to sex, not too short.....  I certainly hope it becomes Korn's next single.<br /><br />12 For No One: 5/10  At first 10 or a 2 Way was my least favorite song on this album, but at least it has some nice drumming and a cool interlude, while this song has nothing going for it. This song is about teenage rebellion, but its boring and impossible to get into.<br /><br />13 Seen It All: 8/10  The longest song on the album, and VERY industrial-sounding.  I guess this is the title-track of the album, because Jon references a little child holding a gift that is broken, which basically describes the cover art.  Not their best, but not bad either.  It is actually kind of a creepy song, and gets emotional and has some nice bagpipes.  This may actually be Korn's most bagpipe-heavy album.  Of course nothing will ever top Shoots and Ladders.  I also agree with a lot of other reviewers on here that say this should have been Korn's last song on the record.<br /><br />14 Tearjerker: 7/10  I guess they felt like they had to put a emotional song on here SOMEWHERE, and decided to stick in in the end.  This may be Korn's phoniest emotional song ever, I can't see anyone relating to it.  Faget was emotional, but had some sort of redemption and payback, Daddy was the same thing, it had a resolution with Jon cussing out the man who did this.  But this....  Its REALLY repetitive, goes nowhere, and is boring.  Jonathan once said that they had a superstition about having 13 tracks on an album, which is why Follow the Leader had all those empty tracks.  Maybe they should excorcise THAT demon too, and not do any songs like this again.<br /><br />Overall I would rate this album 75/100, which would be about a C, but I am giving Korn respect for being the last nu metal band standing.  They created this genre, and they are going to be around when it dies.  Unless they totally disban their roots and go to a whole different playing field, which I think they might.  I think the reason that so many of the tracks on here sound different is because they wanted to see what worked for them and their fans, before they chose which \\"door\\" to go through.  Because that is what this record is about, that is why you see all those doors on the cd, this isn't Korn evolved or anything, this is them experimenting with a lot of new sounds and deciding which one they want to try.  I for one just hope that Korn chooses the right door, because I look foward to hearing more from them.<br /><br />Overall this album is recommended to Korn fans and non-Korn fans, and please, resist the urge to throw it away the second you hear it, this will probably grow on you, and appreciate the fact that Korn is staying around.I couldn't get over how awful the guitar was on here(or lack of it) there are some decent parts that Munky has on here, but most of it is just the same dull riff over and over, easily overshadowed by the drums and Jonathan.

B00000G3AZ|4.0|I only have one trifle to add, as others have written detailed reviews of the film and did a better job of that than I could. The DVD has no extras and more importantly the quality of the video transfer is poor, especially when viewed on an HD television.
B000ENWKN8|2.0|Lately it seems like Rob Zombie has lost alot of his grit, this album sounds a lot like a Black Sabbath album or something of that nature.  I absolutely loved Hellbilly Delux, and Sinister Urge was all right, but Rob has really gone downhill in my opinion.  A lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired, Let it All Bleed out is all right, but I would take any track from Hellbilly over it.  BRING BACK THE OLD ROB ZOMBIE!!!!!
B000EMGAGW|1.0|\\"When Nas, Jay-Z, DMX Pac & Biggie(when they were alive),  Jadakiss,gangstarr, mobb deep 2 name a few drops album, I dont bother listening to it, I just buy it because you know you'll heavy hittin beats and verses hip hop lovers expect from them.I have never made a fool of myself buying cd's and supporting Hip-hop for most part of the 15 years. But I would say Mobb Deep made a fool of themselves and the whole Hip hop world by the Blood Money album \\"compilation\\" release.No real Mobb deep collabos that I yearn for. Llyod banks, Tony Yayo, young Buck and the fake puffy \\"50\\" all over a Mobb Deep album!!!! Is this for real????????They were meant to be thier own bosses even if on paper signed to 50. Common guys!!!!!! you could do better than this. How hungry were they to stoop so low...... to this level? An album of 14 tracks with no stand out track! No stand out rhyme! Capital P seeking cheap publicity by having a go at religion and God!!!!! The album to me, (if not to everyone, who's listened to it) sounded more like rhymes left over by 50, H & P put the pieces together to make an album. H & P rhyming like guys with no talent at all when they supposed to be gifted rappers. What a pity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have to put my cd on the net and give it for free. The money spent on the cd to me is like charity. Unfortunately on a WACK album....the WORST in Hip hop so far\\" What a loss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000EULJLU|3.0|Several years of reading reviews online here, and finally the first time I've bothered to log in and write a word. <br />Not because tool is better than any other band, prog or not.  perhaps the biggest reason is that the record captured me far more than lateralus, which after 5 years of listens, i still hold it against aenima, to which it cant compare.  Nor can this disc, in my mind.  I DO like 10,000 days, it has redeeming qualities in the bits of 'expansion', with the tabla's and chanting, progressive elements, and those proggy elements reminiscent of floyd (the guitar near the beginning of jambi). <br />For whatever reason though, as an AVID tool fan since when sober & prison sex were singles, I cannot bring myself to like an album better than aenima.  I will NEVER critcize tool for making whatever music THEY want to make, and i love progession and evolution, but at the same time i yearn for another album to all out grab me, kick my ass, and soothe me all at once the way aenima has. <br />this is NOT intended as a slam to 10,000 days (which i have barely touched upon).  the new album is a must buy for any tool fan, and obviously anyone willing to step outside the 4 minute radio limit.  No standout singles here beyond vicarious, IMO.  while not a concept album, as most tool, this is best listened to all the way through. <br />i know careful preparation is necessary with bands possessing this amount of vision, but i hope its not another 5 years before the fix is delivered.
B00005JKHN|3.0|This is a very well done DVD by Disney. The art looks great, and sound is wonderful.  If you're thinking of buying this, though, get this for the extras: all are dated and easily recall the era of the late 50's that the movie was released in. \\"4 Artists Paint 1 Tree\\" and \\"The Peter Tchaikovsky Story\\" are especially enjoyable and add another dimension to the viewing of the film.   <br /> <br />The commentary, on the other hand, is nothing special.  Yes, there are a couple of songs thrown in that got cut out of the final production.  But there is also quite a bit of buttering up of the final production as well as of Walt Disney himself.   The commentary is also almost completely disembodied from the film itself - it sounds like they carried out separate interviews with those involved on a few major topics (background art, overall design, Walt Disney) and simply rearranged clips with the voice of a narrator, while in large part ignoring the action of the film.   <br /> <br />Get it if you really need to complete the collection.  Otherwise, an extremely entertaining rent from your local library thanks to the extras they decided to include.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Every once in a while the conversation will turn to \\"favorite movies.\\" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it. <br /> <br />I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic. <br /> <br />No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully. <br /> <br />James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed. <br /> <br />This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, \\"flying\\". \\"Iceberg, right ahead!\\" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears. <br /> <br />The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many. <br /> <br />I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity. <br /> <br />Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've been a Tool fan ever since I saw the video for Sober back in 1990. I have to admit, I thought 10,000 Days was just an okay album when I first listened. Thought it was good but subpar for Tool. I thought it was missing something, not enough substance. As I listened to it more and more, I realized that it's not missing anything. Everything is great! The interludes blend in perfectly with the songs. I didn't care much for Rosetta Stone (must be listened together with Lost Keys) when I first listened to it. Now it's one of my favorite songs. The song kind of reminds me of Third Eye. Not music wise, but style wise. When the songs climaxes, I get chills. Come to think of it, I didn't like Third Eye much at all either when I first listened to it. Now it's one of my favorite Tool songs. Guys and gals, you don't listen to Tool, you experience them!  <br /> <br />To put it simply, this is not an album for Opiate fans, Undertow fans, Aenima fans, or Lateralus fans. This is an album for Tool fans. Opiate is different than Undertow, Undertow is than Aenima, Aenima is different than Lateralus, and now 10,000 Days is different than any other Tool albums, which, in my opinion is a great thing! Each Tool album has it's own characteristic, 10,000 days has it's own.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|<br />Pearl Jam is back after Riot Act with a new record that blows all preconceived expectations.  Yes.  Ed, Stone, Mike, Jeff and Matt have put together a cohesive and solid album.  A Versus vibe is all over this record with strong punkish songs, exploding solos, melodic riffs, incredible drums and bass lines and Ed's voice giving 101% on each track.  <br /> <br />Thank you PJ for opening the window and letting fresh air come through.  <br />
B000F1IQNM|4.0|I didn't expect to like this as much as I did.  The Brown children are out of control after the death of their mother (like most fairy tales - the mother is dead), and they have driven off 17 nannies with their mischevious shenanigans.  The prank they pull on nanny 17 at the beginning is funny and *seems* shocking, though it's quickly revealed to be harmless.   <br /> <br />Magical Nanny McPhee shows up once no more nannies are willing to, and takes control of the situation immediately.  I don't know if there is a spelled out reason for her various imperfections vanishing when the children learn something (when they learn the first lesson, one of her warts disappears, etc), but I took it to be a reminder of how people become more attractive to us once we know them? Or not to judge by appearences. <br /> <br />It has a very predictable fairy-tale ending, which you would expect - it is a child's film.  There was enough to keep me interested without adding any \\"adult\\" humor.  Nanny McPhee also teaches the father one of the lessons, to listen to his children. <br /> <br />Bright, colorful, with a hideous potential \\"evil stepmother\\", magic, good winning over evil, and consequences for misbehaving, this is great for children, funny and one that I think will be watched over and over - although the fairy-tale ending may appeal more to girls than boys.  It might also be a good discussion starter for behaving, or why pranks might be funny in movies, but not in real life.
B000000OA6|5.0|It still suprises me to think that Freddie was dying when he made this because this is one of the greatest albums ever.  You might expect someone who is dying of such a terrible disease such as AIDS to complain or stay in bed but not Freddie he had to go out on top, and that he did.  It begins with \\"Innuendo\\" a six minute progressive epic song that went straight to number 1 in England.  The song probably has alot to due with Freddie dying even if it was mostly written by Roger.  Regardless who wrote it is the best song Queen has written since Bohemian Rhapsody.  The following hit is a weird one.  \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" has a playful video and music yet its lyrics are depressing.  The song talks about what Freddie was going through during his illness with lines such as \\"I'm one card short of a full deck\\" and \\"I'm one wave short of a ship wreck\\".  Depressing indeed.  Next is the rocker \\"Headlong\\" which is one of the most upbeat songs on the album.  I have no clue what the song is about but I sure do love it.  \\"I Can't Live With You\\" is the next rocker song, while better on the later Queen Rocks album this song is pretty good with catchy lyrics and a nice rock stance to go along with it.  \\"Don't Try So Hard\\" is a ballad that is very powerful with Freddie singing in falsetto for some of it and it the middle is very strong \\"Oh what a beautiful world / this is the life for me\\" that part gives me shivers everytime.  Next is the Roger penned \\"Ride the Wild Wind\\" and Queen vets will know this is a Roger song right away with the fast tempo and the race car sounds.  It also has some very catchy YEAH YEAH YEAH's in it. The next is the Barcelona album demo \\"All God's People\\" and since Tim Rice worked with Freddie on Barcelona and he also did the Lion King it makes me wonder if he was inspired by this song because they sound very similiar.  Overally it's a good song with a powerful beginning but kind of dies off towards the end.  The next is one of the tearjerkers on the album called \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\".  It features a video with Freddie's last on screen appearance and animation from Disney.  The song is beautiful and the final line \\"I Still Love You\\" is very emotional to any Queen fan.  Now for a complete change of pace we go to \\"Delilah\\" which is a song about Freddie's favorite feline companion.  Not a very good song, kind of poppy and features the band mates with some terrible \\"Meows\\".  Roger hated this song and I can't blame him, yet I still respect Freddie that he wanted to write a song for his beloved cat.  The next is a little better, Brian May's \\"Hitman\\" is one of Queen's heaviest songs yet has some of the worst lyrics.  The Hitman referred to in the song can be a reference to the AIDS virus that was killing Freddie.  It's a fun song to bang your head too just don't listen to the lyrics too carefully.  Now we close out the album with two magnificent songs.  \\"Bijou\\" has one of the best guitar solos i've heard.  It does not have many lyrics but it does not need them as that guitar is just amazing and very sad.  It sets up the next song perfectly too.  Now for Queen's last epic song \\"The Show Must Go On\\".  Ask any Queen what their favorite Queen songs are and more than likely they will say this one.  It is an intense song about life continuing after Freddie was gone.  Freddie delivers on this song as his vocals really lift the song to an incredible high.  Overall if you're not sold yet than you probably won't be.  Innunedo is an album that defines a group like Queen.  It shows what kind of character they have, that they can go into the studio and create such a wonderful album with only a little time remaining.  What a fabulous group they were, and what a fabulous album this is.called \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\".  It features a video with Freddie's last on screen appearance and animation from Disney.  The song is beautiful and the final line \\"I Still Love You\\" is very emotional to any Queen fan.  Now for a complete change of pace we go to \\"Delilah\\" which is a song about Freddie's favorite feline companion.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I honestly can't fathom how this album is not a 5 star album all the way through, but that's not up to me.  Every time I listen to OK Computer, I find something new that I fall in love with.  If you have a true ear for talent, creativity, substance, and passion than you will not have any reason to see this album in any other way.
0804115613|5.0|I truly love this story.  I like the way the story goes back in time for a chapter and then is current (1986) the next chapter.  Just pay attention to the chapter titles so you know where you are (what city and date)  Flagg is a great storyteller.  When I finished reading the book, I went to the store and found green tomatoes and actually made the recipe which is in the back of the book.  My husband loved the fried green tomatoes.  I must go rent the movie now.  I have not seen it since it was out in the theatres.  I forgot there was a murder mystery along with the novel.  This is a must read.  A real feel good story.  I wish I could go visit Whistle Stop.  Other than Idgie being my favorite character, I would say the town of Whistle Stop is my favorite character.
1892005034|5.0|First, the basics.  Before I read this book, I had no idea that there were learnable techniques for enhancing your performance of empathy.  For that matter, I didn't even know that empathy is something that you do; I thought that it was just something that you feel.  Well, it turns out that empathy is really an activity with techniques, and this book teaches them. <br /> <br />Now for some context.  In the last year, I've read about twenty books on emotional intelligence (EQ) and related topics.  (If you're unfamiliar with the term, just think of EQ as \\"socio-emotional fitness\\".  It can be roughly divided into self-awareness, self-direction, social perception and relationship management.)  Good intellectual frameworks for understanding EQ have been easy for me to find; practical instructions for increasing your EQ seem rather more rare.  (By \\"practical instructions\\" I mean pragmatic action plans with specific things to DO, not just project proposals with goals to accomplish.  It's a shame how often the latter is presented when the former is needed.)  In my reading experience, \\"Nonviolent Communication\\" is THE premiere how-to guide for improving your performance at doing empathy, which is one of the fundamental competencies of EQ. <br /> <br />Third, a caution in the form of a metaphor.  The author is proffering you a diamond while demonstrating an oddly formal way of holding it.  Just take the diamond and ignore the formalities.  That is to say, other reviewers have pointed out that he uses some rather stilted language at times, and that's true; but, the phrasing is NOT the point.  The remarkable insights are what matter. <br /> <br />Fourth, an idiosyncratic recommendation.  One of most amazing ways that this book helped me was by teaching me how to empathize with my OWN needs.  That made it much easier for me to tackle certain problem behaviors of mine without threatening the universal human psychological needs that those behaviors were (self-defeatingly) satisfying.  (The book \\"Flawless!\\" by Tartaglia is a good place to start for that, BTW.)  I firmly believe that one of the best uses of \\"Nonviolent Communication\\" is to lay a strong cognitive foundation for future self-improvement. <br /> <br />Finally, some setting of expectations.  As with any competency training techniques -- musical performance, physical fitness, whatever -- how much you benefit will depend on how much you practice.  However, if you work at it then you will change your thinking, which will change your behavior, which will change your character and your circumstances, which will change your destiny, which will change the world. <br /> <br />This book is eagerly waiting to improve the human condition through you.  Will you activate it?
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is a very polarizing Pink Floyd album.  Some people love it, some hate, with few in between.  I personally love it.  It is a sound that they would never capture again, and it features on of the last Gilmour songs (before the Momentary Lapse/Division Bell disaster) and I believe the very last Rick Wright song. <br /> <br />The album opens with the title suite, called Atom Heart Mother, with six parts.  These are: <br />1.) Father's Shout: a very, very good opening, very interesting, introduces the music  very well. <br />2.) Breast Milky: the music really starts to develop here, keeps the suite moving, but not the best part of the song. <br />3.) Mother Fore: I believe this is the part with the chanting.  It's very odd, but very good at the same time <br />4.) Funky Dung: some more very interesting music <br />5.) Mind Your Throats Please: I think this part has both of the spoken sentences in the song, which are, \\"here is a loud announcement,\\" and, \\"silence in the studio.\\"  very good. <br />6.) Remergence: this final part ties everything together very well. <br />Overall, the song is amazing, but it takes a while to get into. <br /> <br />The next song is Waters' If.  Some call this song underdevoloped, which I find unfair.  The lyrics are powerful if you take time to analyze them (which you have to do to appreciate post-Barrett Floyd). <br /> <br />Summer '68 is, I believe, the last Rick Wright song with Pink Floyd.  It is about the \\"summer of love,\\" and is about a one night stand Wright had (or made up, I don't know).  It's a fun tune, and I love the line, \\"tommorrow brings another town, another girl like you.\\" <br /> <br />Fat Old Sun is the third gem on this album (AHM Suite and If being the others).  It is probably Gilmour's best lyrical effort.  It could be about smoking marijuana, but if you don't like drug songs, there are a multitude of other things it could be about, so don't worry. <br /> <br />Finally, the album ends with Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast, a song that should only be listened to in the context of the album.  It's interesting, but it gets old quickly. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is an excellent album to put in the car, or to listen to while you read, or to fall asleep to before you listen to it by itself.  Once you get to that point however, you will recognize this gem of an album for what it is: a gem.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Cannot wait for this season on DVD!  I already own Season 1.  Have not missed an episode of Season 2.  Cannot wait to rewatch the whole season on DVD before Season 3 begins.  A definite pre-order.  The show is smart and fun and the actors are so nice to look at!
1581250282|1.0|This book is one of the most boaring books i have read in my entire life. While many kids in highschool loathe reading, i happen to be one of the few who enjoy reading on my spare time. This book made me want to die. While i do belive philosophy is intresting, thought provoking, and entertaining, this book made me want to fall alseep. I love the ideas of these thinkers, but the way it's presented is just..boaring. I often had to read pages over and over again, because i could not grasp the concept. Not because it was too difficult, but because i found my mind wandering off onto other subjects.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|evreything on the album was amazing even the acoustic! Iam a big fan of slipknot and they combined the thrash metal scene in with emotional acoustic.go pick it up now if you dont have it.
0316666343|4.0|Have you ever wondered what it would be like in heaven? Do you ever wonder what it would be like in heaven if you have been raped, murdered, and your family has no clue what has happened to you? For Susie Salmon, this is her terrifying reality. Susie was raped and murdered by the seductive Mr. Harvey. In heaven Susie looks down on her sister's first and only love, her mother's affair, her brother trying to understand, and her father's agony of losing a child. This realistic fiction novel written by Alice Sebold will grab hold of you and take you along a long path of a family who will break apart and grow back together again. <br /> I absolutely fell in love with this book. I could not put The Lovely Bones down. Susie's journey to seek ways to help her family and a dear friend find their way after her death was epidemic. I just had to find out what was going to happen next! I would recommend this book to advanced 14 year old readers and up. I recommend The Lovely Bones to that age level because this book deals with rape, emotional pain of losing a family member, and a higher level of reading skill. I could most connect with Susie Salmon because I, like Susie, am 14, live in a small mid-western town, very gullible, and super anxious to be in high school. I adore realistic fiction because it is easily relatable to my life. I really enjoyed Sebold's style of writing in The Lovely Bones because I thought it was easy to follow with Susie being the narrator translating what was happening to each of her family members. <br /> All-in-all The Lovely Bones is a thrilling book that will keep the tears coming and the pages turning. <br />
B000EULJLU|3.0|Musically and lyrically, this album is a step back for Tool. Whereas the songs on Lateralus unfolded like symphonic movements, with well thought out motifs pushing each piece toward its own well-earned, ecstatic climax, the songs of 10,000 Days have none of this ingenuity. Nor does the album have the sense of thematic, spiritual purpose Lateralus had. While a band does not need to repeat the glories of a past album, and while it is always unfair to compare old with new, I do think it is safe to say that Tool is not putting the same care and craft into this effort that it is capable of. A good album by any standard, just not Tool's.
B00005U11Z|5.0|WOW,  I really enjoyed this DVD of the new line up of Journey (but still enjoy the classic Journey w/Steve Perry).  If there is a Journey fan in your family,  this is a must have for everyone.  The new songs they preform from the Arrival album, AMAZING and the other songs that are preformed also AMAZING.
B00004U3UG|5.0|This has probably been addressed, but I can't bring myself to read all those comments... <br /> <br />There is a region 3 DVD release of this film that is the director's cut...but the cut scenes were restored from film sources and look basically as good as the rest of the film. As stated above, the American releases of the director's cut use what looks like video footage to restore the cut scenes. I'm not sure what the issue is, legal probably, but the region 3 release is a must own for those (like me) who NEED the best version. <br /> <br />This was the sole reason I purchased a region-free player, but there have been many reasons since. Do a little research and you'll find many options. <br /> <br />5 stars for the film, not the DVD.
0596009208|4.0|Great coverage of the Java language with concrete examples. Note that some of the content and examples require Java 5.0 (a problem for those who haven't updated to the latest version). Great for newcomers to Java. Some content was lacking (deeper concentration on Threads). Altogether, great book.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|As soon as I saw who the official Amazon reviewer was, and the fact that she dissed the album, I knew I'd like it.  This same writer was my touchstone when with Stereo Review.  If she liked it, I stayed away. If she didn't, I bought it.  Too funny.  Some things never change. I guess a few other people agree with me.
B000EU1KRS|5.0|Basically, there has been a groundswell in the past 6 years of sample-based hip-hop , in which creative producers find the most unlikely licks and tracks from early 70s proto-funk, mid 60s jazz, 80s fusion-funk and anything else you can think of, put it in a blender and bounce it on out to thumping beats. This of course all has its roots in early nineties hip hop, but recent underground greats like Madlib, Jay-Dee, Doom and goods like DJ Shadow and Rjd2 have been pushing the envelope. We can see a lot of this strange brew emerging in the mainstream in Kanye West and others, but albums like Dangerdoom and Madvillainy show the underground selling well in their own right. I believe that Gnarls Barkley is going to be the great crossover hit that will send tweenie 13 year olds tired of bubblegum rap digging through the crates for old hip-hop, soul, gospel and funk albums to find out what real music is. <br />This album, in short, is truly great. Cee-Lo, a more mainstream rapper/singer/producer with a phenomenal voice and a great energy, teams up with Dangermouse to create a thrilling energy that should capture the attention of kids who like to swing and adults to miss the thrill of Marvin Gaye and Al Green. The continually exciting underground hip hop scene reaches a real peak on this album, and Cee-Lo shines like he never has before. Recommended for anyone looking for a great introduction to what is exciting in music today.
0920668372|1.0|How this book came to be so popular is beyond me. I bought it years ago when I heard people raving about it. Please! Yes, it is natural for a mother to love her child forever and hopefully the feeling is returned, but the bizarre way parent-child love is presented in this book is unnatural and borders on a weird, unhealthy relationship!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|If someone would of told me at the begginig of this year pearl jam would release one of, if not, their best albums this year in 2006, I would have laughed right in their face! Prior to its release it had garnerd a lot of hype and was said to be a return to form for pearl jam. J-records owner Clive Davis seemed esspecially enthused about this release talking about how its thier best ever and will bring them back to the spotlight blah blah whatever. Call me cynical, but after the painfully dissapointing \\"riot act\\" and \\"binural\\", I scoffed at the idea and dissmissed it as probley a weak attemp at another ten. I noticed this album had hit shelves when I picked up tools latest. I don't know what it was, maybe the positive early reviews I had read, or the fact I am a huge fan of everything the band did until '98, or maybe just the cool looking artwork, or most likely the discount price, but I decided to give it a go.To whatever force it was that led me to buying this album, I am most greatful.       This is not a weak attempt at recapturing the bands glory days. It is classy, relevent, catchy, powerful, and most importantly, rockes the past five or six PJ albums right out of the water.  This is definetly and pleasent suprise for me, concidering I had long since declared the band dead.     I couldent tell you what the standouts are on this record, becouse all the tracks are pure hard rock gold. I wouldent be suprised if this ended up being rememberd as the best rock album of the year. Hats off to these boys.
B000000W3G|5.0|Contrary to another review on this page, if you are a fan of The Smashing Pumpkins, you are going to love this set. Although I am quite a big Pumpkins fan, I think even non-hardcore fans will like it. Wheather you like the sorrowful splendor of Adore, the more up-beat feeling of Siamese Dream, or just the pure beauty of Mellon Collie, you're going to love this set because it has it all. There's even a bit of almost heavy metal-ness in the song 'Pastichio Medley' which is just 25 minutes of guitar riffs piled into one track. I know how bad that sounds now, but think of it like this: the riffs are like those catchy openings of songs like 'Today', 'Thirty-Three', and 'Here Is No Why', and they sound surprisingly good end-to-end.    <br /> <br />The tracks on this set still have that famous Smashing Pumpkins feel to them; I don't find them any less enjoyable than the songs on Mellon Collie or Adore. In fact, a lot of my favorite songs are on here. There's such a great variety: there are beautiful covers songs of The Carrs and The Cure, songs featuring mainly D'arcy and James on vocals, angry songs, sad songs, happy songs....oh, I could go on and on. I have to point out that D'arcy's voice is absolutely amazing on 'Dreaming', as is James's on 'The Boy'. Listen to the samples; I think you'll like what you hear.   <br /> <br />And then there's the cost factor. I actually bought mine here on Amazon for $40. It was not new, but was still in mint condition. Listen to the song samples, and if you like them and you can find it for a reasonable price, just go for it. Believe me, you will not regret it. This is truely a beautiful piece of art that I am very passionate about, and I hope you fall in love with it as much as I have.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I sometimes wonder if Trent Reznor (Whom I have great respect for and really enjoy his work) feels like Salieri to Mozart when listening to Tool or Perfect Circle.    I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  I loved Lateralus, it still blows my mind at how refined, insightful, spiritual, and flat out enjoyable experience it was.  10,000 days seems to be in the continuation of this psuedo-spiritual era of Tool.    If you are one of the Tool fan minority that did not like Lateralus, then 10,000 days will probably also no thrill you.  However if you liked Lateralus I sincerely believe that you will enjoy 10,000 days.      Though Lateralus is still a stronger experience in my opinion, 10,000 days is yet another example of Maynard James Keenan being one of the great living musicians.
B000EULJLU|3.0|their selling out, thats what i think. thats too bad because these guys use to rock. now what we have here is a mellowed laid back tool. while the music itself is not bad, it could have been alot heavier at times and a little darker. it seems like they took alot of the best parts from lateralus and expaded them into longer song on here, and also maynard seems to be getting a little carried away with his own voice, dude we know you're a great vocalist but you really don't need to try so hard to let everyone know it. i guess this happens to the best of bands, money starts rolling in and the whole reason for writing music loses its meaning after so many limo rides and groupies...
B000EULJLU|5.0|for those who have read all the bad reviews and are in a bit of confusion.. relax. those people dont know what thier talking about, they are way chained to the past. what tool did is bringing something new like always. <br /> <br />loved all the tracks, creative and powerful, yet the cd only misses one extra track.. it felt real short ;( <br /> <br />paving this fact.. this is one of the best cds this year so dont miss it !!
B000EULJLU|5.0|It's been five long years since Tool's has released a new album. Finally, 10,000 Days is out and it is amazing. I haven't been able to take this album out of my cd player since the day I bought it. Tool gave this album a variety of musical texture with songs such as Vicarious and Jambi that totally rock out and then songs such as 10,000 Days (Wings part 2) and Right In Two, which have a more laid back chillin vibe. 10,000 Days is by far Tool's lyrically best album. The music is also incredible. Sings like Jambi and Right in Two sent chills up my spin when first listening to them. It took me awhile but when I got into the album and listened to it a couple of times I found myself playing songs like The Pot and Rosetta Stoned over and over again. The only downfall in this album is the fillers like Lost Keys and Vigniti Tres. Tool should have put one more track on the album instead of the time fillers. Overall if you're a Tool fan this is a must have album.
0393317552|4.0|I have heard it argued that this book is dry and unreadable.  Personally, I think that those who would call it dry mistake a lack of flowery language for clarity of voice. <br /> <br />While it clearly has an agenda to prove, this book is very well articulated and supports most of its ideas very well with facts.  Nothing is ever proven (a difficult task indeed!), but the information presented is very compelling, and, even if you are not swayed by Diamond's thesis, the wealth of interesting data presented in an interesting and understandable fashion makes it worth the read.
B00000273M|5.0|During the 80s, the Bangles solidified themselves not only as one of the best girl groups, but one of the best groups overall.  This CD contains an anthology of their greatest hits and will take you back in time to the 80s. <br /> <br />Led by Susanna Hoffs' melodic vocals, Michael Steele's bass, Vicki Peterson's guitar, and Debbi Peterson's drums, the Bangles created a collection of songs that have stood the test of time and still remain popular today.  This CD is loaded with great songs, including \\"Going Down to Liverpool\\", the classic \\"Manic Monday\\", \\"If She Knew What She Wants\\", the #1 \\"Walk Like an Egyptian\\", \\"Hazy Shade of Winter\\" from the movie \\"Less Than Zero\\", the upbeat \\"In Your Room\\", and another #1 \\"Eternal Flame\\" <br /> <br />This greatest hits CD is the perfect collection for the person who doesn't want to go out and buy each individual album.  All of the best songs are contained in this great single CD.  I highly recommend this great disc.  Listen to this CD and hear one of the best girl groups from the 80s.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Although I think its absurd to review an album like this after 5 days, I have a special circumstance. Being in the business, I must confess I got hold of this album 2 weeks prior to release. I listened to it all day to its entirety never skipping around. I listened every day from start to finish, over and over until it came out on May 2nd. Then I went and bought the album. After killing 30 minutes with the stereoscopic lenses, I ran through the album in my car. Then I listened more at work, I listened in my car again, I listened with headphones... all different experiences. So the first run through, I locked on to a couple tracks and really liked them. I thought to myself \\"eh, this is pretty good, but not blowing me away.\\" Here's the catch, and this holds true for most Tool albums, this band makes you earn it. They make you listen over and over again. It takes patience to appreciate the genius of what is going on here. I was deeply angered by the moron who reviewed this album and called track #9 \\"Intension\\" \\"filler\\" and in his expert opinion said \\"skip it\\" Are you kidding me? Go listen to this track on a great system and turn it up loud around 6:30 into the song and listen as it flawlessly gives way to track #10, \\"Right In Two\\" Now after approximately 3 to 4 full length listens a day, I can without a doubt say this is my favorite Tool album to date. As one reviewer wrote \\"Tool is ridiculous\\" Yes, he's right, and this is the perfect analogy. Tool is ridiculous... ridiculously amazing. I like 10,000 Days because its different, it makes me emotional, and it is like a great journey. Is masterpiece a strong enough word?
B00006RCOB|5.0|When Tom Clancy came out with his first book THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER many people did not connect it to the fact that it appeared at the tail end of a short-lived movie-craze. A decade before, a former teacher in Wales Craig Thomas had written a book about the American military's quest to acquire the Soviet Union's latest super-weapon, a technologically advanced fighter that would leave the United States aerial defenses largely obsolete.<br />Of course structurally the two tales are very different and apart from both falling into the genre of techno-thriller these are two very different stories. But following the release of Clint Eastwood's adaptation of the Thomas book in 1982 the movie and television screens were strewn with tales of the latest technologically advanced [place mode of transportation here]. We had a super car in KNIGHT RIDER (currently in reruns on the Sci-Fi channel), and not one but two super helicopters with BLUE THUNDER on the big screen and AIRWOLF on television. It was only natural that a submarine, that most stealthy of all vehicles, would come in for the same treatment.<br />Yet what Thomas delivered in his novel was a perfect fusion of suspense and high adrenaline action adventure, a fact that Eastwood himself credited with his decision to persuade Warner Bros, to acquire the rights to the property on the 22:35 documentary included as a special feature on the disc.<br />In fact, despite this featurettes length, clocking as it does at a little more than 22 minutes, it does boast a wealth of information on the production of the movie and seeing it here had a special significance for me.<br />It was this very documentary that had led my family to sneak an 11-year old boy on the English-Scottish border into seeing this picture, despite that fact that it was certified (in the now defunct) AA, that meant that those seeing the movie had to be 14-years old or older. I remember that this merely added to the sense of excitement and wonder as the movie unfolded and the image of the Firefox streaking across the sky in the closing minutes became seared into my memory for years until I saw it once more - on the small screen,<br />Presented by the BBC's Iain Johnstone, the featurette gives us a glimpse into the work that went into the production of the movie. And includes on-camera archival interviews with Eastwood, Thomas, special effects guru John Dykstra and British actor Warren Clark who plays Pavel, the moustaches dissident who helps Eastwood's Mitchell Gant escape the KGB.<br />In addition to clips from FIREFOX, ANY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE and BRONCO BILLY the full-frame documentary also features clips of Eastwood working with the crew on the night scene on the riverbank. And shots of the art department transforming the Vienna subway into the Moscow subway by the addition of Russian language posters and signs. It is here that we learn that Thomas used street maps of Moscow when writing the novel.<br />Eastwood recounts the horror that his direction that the special effects shots be in daylight was met with and Dykstra talks about how they ran out of location when taking background shots for the speeding Firefox. It's a credit to Dykstra's Apogee team that the effects still deliver white-knuckle excitement in the last third of the film as Gant attempts to flee the Soviet Union.<br />Helping to place the movie in its proper historical perspective are shots from the films Washington DC premiere, an event that was attended by a number of the members of then President Ronald Reagan's administration.<br />Also included on the DVD is a cast and crew listing that allows the reader to select both Clint Eastwood and writer Alex Lasker for their respective filmographies. There is also the widescreen theatrical trailer that plays up the movies action sequences that make the movie look brimming with action. I was impressed that, given the age of the picture, the trailer looks in such great shape, its crisp and the colors wellbalanced. Indeed the movie also appears in great shape and even though by today's standard of ultimate editions these features seem a little thin on the ground, it's still a serviceable release with an excellent transfer.<br />But, what of the movie itself. It is in fact everything Eastwood said it was, a broad high-style adventure, along with the elements of a tight suspense film. Eastwood plays a burnt out pilot from Vietnam, still haunted by the horrors he witnessed. Yet, given the fact that he is fluent in Russian, he is the best shot the U.S. military has in stealing the Firefox, a supersonic fighter invisible to radar that operates through mind commands that require the pilot to THINK in Russian.<br />So, as the movie opens we see a helicopter flying through the Alaskan wilderness, it's the American military coming to try and persuade a reluctant Gant back into the service of his country. It's not long before he's in London being prepped for the mission by Kenneth Aubry (in a remarkable and memorable performance by Freddie Jones) and being transformed into the part of an American businessman. Then its onto Moscow where he meets up with a group of dissidents intent on helping him steal the fighter.<br />The suspense really ratchets up in the middle of the picture to true edge-of-your-seat tension as the KGB begins to put the clues together and close in on Gant, as he (aided by Pavel) attempts to reach the hanger holding the fighter.

But, what of the movie itself. It is in fact everything Eastwood said it was, a broad high-style adventure, along with the elements of a tight suspense film. Eastwood plays a burnt out pilot from Vietnam, still haunted by the horrors he witnessed. Yet, given the fact that he is fluent in Russian, he is the best shot the U.S. military has in stealing the Firefox, a supersonic fighter invisible to radar that operates through mind commands that require the pilot to THINK in Russian.   So, as the movie opens we see a helicopter flying through the Alaskan wilderness, it's the American military coming to try and persuade a reluctant Gant back into the service of his country. It's not long before he's in London being prepped for the mission by Kenneth Aubry (in a remarkable and memorable performance by Freddie Jones) and being transformed into the part of an American businessman. Then its onto Moscow where he meets up with a group of dissidents intent on helping him steal the fighter.  The suspense really ratchets up in the middle of the picture to true edge-of-your-seat tension as the KGB begins to put the clues together and close in on Gant, as he (aided by Pavel) attempts to reach the hanger holding the fighter. Indeed the final flight to freedom serves as a release of all that pent up tension, as the picture transforms itself from a suspense thriller into a roller-coaster ride of adventure.   In this section the movie picks up its pace and Klaus Löwitsch shines in these scenes as Gen. Vladimirov.as he attempts to second-guess the American. The sequences in this section still hold my attention today, as much as they did as an 11-year old 24 years ago.  With pre-CGI effects that still hold up remarkably well today, first-class performances from an incredible cast and tight scriptingin the adaptation of an excellent novel it should be no surprise that I list FIREFOX as one of my favorite thrillers.   Hopefully a more feature laden DVD will be released in the future, but this will do for now.  Recommended.
B00000AFFF|4.0|I bought this album in October of 1998- it had just come out. I happened to be in New York on vacation and went up to Radio City Music Hall. On the marquee: Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach. I went up to the window to find out if there were any tickets left. (This was about two days before the concert).<br /><br />There were two left. Anyway, great concert and interesting idea. The best song is still \\"God Give Me Strength,\\" but \\"My Thief\\" is also quite good. This is not \\"My Aim is True XIV!\\" It's Elvis' words and Elvis and Burt's music. If you like the way Elvis crafts a song, you'll enjoy this. If not, beware!
0066620996|3.0|After reading hundred of books in this genre, I've come to expect some rehashing of ideas which was no different this time around. Collins has some great ideas about building lasting businesses but most of it is very theoretical like what you learned when you were 21 in physics class at college...hey that's nice but will I ever use more than 10% of that it in the real world?  <br /> <br />One outstanding chapter which only a few companies use: Hire your employees based on ABILITY not EXPERIENCE. A 23 yr old genius with great work ethic who is undiscovered or underappreciated, is better than a 45 yr old veteran of the industry who wants a salary + benefits position looking to produce adequate results. You don't need to hire people with experience if you hire people that can and want to learn, who will cross the boundaries of their position and develope along with your company. Best chapter in the book, shame that most companies don't use the advice.

B00005JL96|1.0|Unless of course you think that a movie whose underlying premise and action all revolve around one alien trying to kill another one is suitable for small children. This movie starts out full of violence, and never gets better. Along the way we see bad family relations, destructive and manipulative behavior, and a pseudo-Barbie-like older sister. What's to love in this movie? Are people so hard up for something to do they love a movie that glorifies violence and hyper-activity as beloved?  I was astonished to discover so many 5 star reviews and recommendations as a kid's movie. If you have small children, find something else to do, this movie will only disturb them, it doesn't have enough value to risk it.
B000EBEHR2|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Placebo for a long time- ever since I saw them on MTV2 ten years ago, my jaw hit the floor and it was \\"pure morning\\" from then on. Their albums have always been there when I needed them the most, and for that I thank them. However, this album lacked what had drawn me to them again and again- their rhythm section. The earth rumbling baselines; the foundational drumming. Placebo is better then the sum of their parts, and, when this album only concentrated on one part we were left with a deflated ablum. The singing was what it had to be- overall, I felt it was strong. Yet, that is all we were left with, was the singing backed up by some digital keyboarding that would only get a C+ in my grade book. I am a huge fan of minimalism- hell, I even have an Eames chair- I just don't think it works for Placebo just yet.
B000002HPV|5.0|This is my favourite Bjork album, in fact one of my favourite albums in general. Almost every song on this album has its own creative genious. Homogenic opens with a moody soundscape that will bring the listener into this mysterious and isolated world right away. Strange electronic beats blend perfectly with the smooth strings and it makes for a sound that no one else has.     She has the ability to gather  all her outrageous concepts and mold those ideas and create an amazing sonic canvas that stands the test of time. \\"All Neon Like\\" is a soothing song with an cool beat. She has a nack for creating some of the most beautiful  sounds you can imagine! The groove is a electro groove. Words can not give you the effect of this music, you need to hear it for your self. I think this music is so creative.
B00008H2LB|3.0|It just gets repetitive.  All of the songs are more or less based off of a catchy chorus, while everything in between leads up to the chorus or is just bland.  Now there are some great songs on here, like Breaking the Habit, but many are simplistic and boring after the first listen.
0312323859|5.0|After reading Something Borrowed of course I had to pick this book up. I really enjoyed this one as well in fact it brought tears to my eyes at the end. I really liked how Griffin did not change Darcy's character and made you dislike her until she changed. I am looking forward to reading the next book when it comes out.
B000F7CMRW|5.0|Fantastic movie that offers great insight into the Middle East turmoil, we find ourselves embroiled in at present.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is just so awsome! Finally I get to watch the dubbed version after watching the japanese version of the film, I atomaticaly wanted to buy it. The CG in this movie is so overwhelming, I haven't played the whole entire game through yet but thats not necessary anymore. I already know the story and everything. For those who aren't FF fans will probaly have a hard time understanding the plot and everything. This is a must buy for all FF fans and Sc-Fi movie lovers. This is the best CG film without a doubt. I love the special features is will. Definatly a movie worth buying.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|Wait a minute, didn't these guys used to be a noise band? With drones that resembled Jesus and Mary Chain or Stone Roses? Well, even J&MC had their \\"Darklands,\\" and for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, their \\"Howl\\" of a detour out of the 80's and into the new century included a stop in the deep south and a collision with T-Bone Burnett. And the big shock is, it fits them like a biker glove.<br /><br />Turning off the amps and picking up a harmonica has served BRMC well. There are more than a few aspirations towards Dylan-hood here, like on \\"Complicated Situation,\\" and mountain blues stomps, like \\"Ain't No Easy Way.\\" These songs do stay the course of BMRC's prior albums in that they offer dark discourses, but the anguish seems more genuine in the falsetto moans of \\"Devil's Waiting\\" than on any of their first two albums. Should the band be able to stay united (they did break-up and reform before starting work on \\"Howl\\"), I am very interested in where their new muse leads them.<br /><br />One of 2005's best.
1400079179|3.0|I only give it 3 stars because of all the hype, and because I was upset when I heard that the Priory of Sion was just a hoax perpetrated by Pierre Plantard in 1956. Otherwise, it is a solid read.<br /><br />This book starts off well, but kind of falls apart at the end.<br /><br />It's easy to get wrapped up in this book, as the plot is intriguing to just about anyone. The hypotheses start wearing thin, however, as the book goes on, and I was not satisfied with the ending.<br /><br />Having read the Holy Blood, Holy Grail, this is far superior to that novel, since it is far less pretentious, and is labeled as pure fiction. If you are to read just one Dan Brown book, though, make it Angels and Demons, which is a far more enjoyable read from start to finish.
B000EGF0NW|4.0|I found this book very interesting.  I have never read a true life rape account.  Sebold is defiantly a champion to not only decide to not lose her sense of humour but to fight the rape charge and win.

B0009K7QZ8|4.0|It can't top the first season but It's definatly a great season and the widescreen view is awesome.  The extras are much better than last year's.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|I don't even know why I am writing this review, I mean, 'Funeral' has been, and still is, one of the most-talked about piece of music in the past years, so chances are high you already know everything about it you should know about this infamous album. But, if you do not, than this review might not be as hopeless after all.     Funeral is the album that boosted Arcade Fire into the hype atmosphere. Their previous effort is also a great piece of work, but it can not compare to this. What Arcade Fire did here, is creating something honest, filled with emotion, without feeling overdone. Even when you take the vocals away, the music itself would be one of the highlights of 2004. The chords are not very complex, but the arrangements are clever, and they make the right things stand up at the right time. The tracks shift gear every once in a while, without ever losing focus or thinking 'argh, I hate this part'. But combined (vocals/music) you enter another new level, with each track having a charactistic setting that can follow eachother without any problem or urge to press the skip button.    'Tunnels' is the first track, and strikes gold immediatly. The guitar builds to a climax with a beautiful piano and a dramatic drum joining it at the right moments. And when that climax arrives, the vocals screaming of emotion; check if you didn't fall off your chair.     'Laika' takes the listener into a more epic, story-telling setting, while 'Power Out' is powerful, taking the vocals to another level (read: even higher). 'Une Annee Sans Lumiere' listens like a lullaby, one where you wish it would never end. 'Kettles' accompanies you up the stairs to the imaginary light, followed by 'Crown of Love', the love song to take you back to reality.     By this time my mouth touched the floor, and I actually wanted to stop the cd from playing any further because I feared it could only get worse. Luckily I was terribly wrong. 'Wake Up' welcomes you with a wall of sound with matching vocals,then comes 'Haiti' , the delicate tropical track with a relaxed setting to let you dream away. And then, then comes one of the best song of the past years; 'Rebellion (Lies)', acknowledged by many. Again the amazing piano from 'Tunnels' makes it return, with drums and bass that makes you forget to breath for a second. It's one of the very few songs in all the music I heard that gives me goose bumps. It ends with 'In The Back Seat', an equaly good track as any other in here, with beautiful female vocals and matching violins.    I listen to all kinds of music, as long as it is any good. There are just a few albums I really love though, and this one ranks easily in that top category. Ofcourse there will always be people who don't like this kind of music, but if you don't own 'Funeral' , risking the chance that you might miss out on an amazing experience, would probably fortify a purchase. If you don't give it a shot, that's ok. But don't tell me I (and most others here) didn't warn you of missing out on something amazing.
B000002H97|5.0|Well just as pink floyd had \\"dark side of the moon\\" and it was an album that defined pink floyd and set a whole new atmosphere for them so did METALLICA with the black album!  <br /> <br />It set a whole new era, atmosphere and generation of music and they made it good and cool to be a metaller! <br /> <br />This is the album that got me into and appreciate the finer side of metal, with amazing sounding guitars, drums and bass, killler songs all amazingly arranged and blistering solos and vocals this IS THE album that not only defined METALLICA but what metal is and was and should sound and be. <br /> <br />Still today this album after 15 years is an album that you simply cannot ignore and have to play and keep playing! from the opening riff and first track of \\"enter sandman\\" to the last track \\"struggle within\\" if you are not into metal you WILL be taken on a dark, angry, emotional and amazing life changing journey that would almost certainly change your perception on metal. <br /> <br />In short!! if you don't have this album even still today! then you really are missing out on an absolute MASTERPIECE! <br /> <br />\\"KRANIUS - EVILUTION\\"
B000062YAY|5.0|After Captor of Sin (recorded live in Belgum) and Live Undead, Slayer nailed what is probably the best live recording in metal history. This is easily comparable to Iron Maiden's, Live After Death. I saw them twice for this tour and Decade captures every ounce of energy from the crowd while allowing each instrument to stand out. It's as close as you can get to being there. I've mentioned this album in the company of Cheap Trick's, Live at Budokan, The Band's, Last Waltz album and even Simon and Garfunkel's, Concert in Central Park. As a music lover and a live show junkie, I give this album all the credit in the world; not to mention this is easily the greatest collection of Slayer songs ever compiled. This is a perfect start for a new fan.
0679731725|5.0|Some books are powerful through the dramatic events they describe, or the profound observations they make, or the invocation of sex or violence or controversy.  \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is powerful through its quietude and control.  Stevens, an aging butler, keeps a journal during his odyssey through the British countryside, recounting the journey as well as a lifetime of professional and personal experiences. <br /> <br />The story Stevens tells is both an ordinary and a remarkable one, and this distilling of universal experiences into an apparently singular tale is compelling.  The narrator's wry observations and the gradual explication of his philosophy of life are entertaining and eminently readable and carry the novel along through its subdued series of events. <br /> <br />It's easy, at times, to miss the depth of the narrator's feeling, to see him as a set piece and an example of a way of life that is comical and outmoded.  Perhaps the author allows this intentionally, but interpreting the narrator's careful intensity as unruffled poise does the character, and his story, a disservice.  \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is not just the tale of a way of life now of questionable relevance; it is the tale of a man questioning his own relevance, and its power comes not from what it has to say about the destiny of the British servant class but from what it has to say about the eventual destiny of us all.
0316172324|4.0|In a book as research-rich as this one, I expected the writing to be \\"scholarly\\" and dense -- the opposite was true! I was surprised to find Gladwell's writing to be accessible and easy to read. I do wish there were more of a take-away, though -- is the conclusion to trust your gut because it's founded in conclusions drawn from data? Or not to trust your gut, because it can be wrong? Or only trust your gut if you're an expert? Not sure. But I'll trust my gut and recommend this book.
B000EMGJM2|4.0|A lot of people didn't even know who Van Hunt was when he hit the scene back in 2004.  Never moving to the middle to please the masses, Van Hunt would rather rock out on a slow ballad than resort to having pointless cameo appearances from artists (who have nothing to do with his music) just to sell a record.  Some might think that Van Hunt isn't soulful enough because he has all these rock elements incorporated into his sound.  If that's the case, then Sly Stone, Lenny Kravitz, Prince, or anybody with a guitar or live instrumentation must not be soulful either.  Van Hunt may have a few songs here and there that sound like the aforementioned artists, but his music is the culmination of those people's works if anything.  That's why On The Jungle Floor is some of Van Hunt's best work to date.<br /><br />Even though his self-titled release was just as good, On The Jungle Floor solidifies his sound for those who might have been thrown off with his first offering.  \\"If I Take You Home\\" begs the question of respectability for going home with someone too soon.  \\"Hot Stage Lights\\" is interesting to say the least, giving some \\"jive turkey\\" anecdotes similar to something Parliament Funkadelic would sing.  \\"Daredevil, Baby\\" starts as a slow, drawn-out tune that flips midway to a drum-heavy ballad.  \\"Ride, Ride, Ride\\" is a head-nodding jam that probably sounds the most like Lenny Kravitz than any other song on the disc.  The enjoyable \\"Being A Girl\\" follows, along with the progressive tune \\"Suspicion (She Knows Me Too Well).\\"  He breaks from the norm and actually pairs up with Nikka Costa for the duet \\"Mean Sleep,\\" a stand-out track in my opinion. \\"Priest Police\\" sounds a lot better than the title suggests, \\"Character\\" is reminiscent of a Curtis Mayfield classic, and the eclectic \\"No Sense Of Crime\\" might leave a few people raising their eyebrows. \\"At The End Of A Slow Dance\\" and \\"The Thrill of This Love\\" both sounds like British Rock songs from the 80s.<br /><br />Van Hunt closes with a few songs more in line with what fans are used to hearing.  \\"Hole In My Heart\\" is a mid tempo cut much like most of the tracks from his first album while \\"The Night Is Young\\" is a slow-paced selection with a choir backing his vocals with a sound more in line with a pop rock song from the late 70s or early 80s.  Any fan of Van Hunt will enjoy On The Jungle Floor with no problem.  Traditional R&B fans will continue to look at him as more of a pop rock artist.  Luckily, Van Hunt knows who he is and will continue his own path to stardom regardless of anybody's opinion.closes with a few songs more in line with what fans are used to hearing.  \\"Hole In My Heart\\" is a mid tempo cut much like most of the tracks from his first album while \\"The Night Is Young\\" is a slow-paced selection with a choir backing his vocals with a sound more in line with a pop rock song from the late 70s or early 80s.

B00005JO17|5.0|Chicken Little was far better than I expected in every way, but enough about the movie... we are now fans of Fish (Out of Water)!. Fish steals the movie and deserves his own movie altogether. What a cute and fun character! We watched the DVD several times just to see Fish's scenes again. Fish has his fans at Disney too obviously because when you surf through the DVD you find more of Fish than Chicken Little. He also has his own game in the official Chicken Little website. I think what makes Fish so endearing is his totally happy attitude no matter the situation... he seems ready for fun always. Don't know how he wound up with the other stereotypical Chicken Little story group (like \\"Turkey Lurkey\\" or whatever)... but Fish is more than a supporting character, he's a star and we hope to see more of him. Fish fans unite!!!

6303921248|5.0|I have watched several versions of Pride and Prejudice, and loved them all. <br /> <br />That being said, this version is by far, the most romantic and exciting of the lot. <br /> <br />I am 46 years old, but the repressed sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett had my heart racing and my palms sweating like a 16 year old school girl. <br /> <br />It brings home the sad fact that I am going to be single for the rest of my life because I will not settle for anything less than my own Mr. Darcy or Mr. Firth for that matter (for me, they are one and the same, no matter how Mr. Firth exclaims that he is not Mr. Darcy). <br /> <br />What I found to be the one of the most exquisite scenes was the dancing scene, as Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett kept separating and coming together while having an intellectual argument. <br /> <br />Equally exquisite was his admission of his admiration for her in his first proposal. <br /> <br />Finally, the last scene when Ms. Bennett states her feelings have changed (admitting her love), the look on Mr. Darcy's face as he was trying to appear in control lets you know that this was a man struggling with a passion he could barely contain. <br /> <br />Colin Firth is, was, and will always be my own Mr. Darcy. <br /> <br />Other great movies with Colin Firth are both Bridget Jones' movies, as well as Girl With a Pearl Earring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMUA|1.0|I like Tarantino movies.  But come on.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 are by far two of the worst movies ever.  On a list of top ten worst movies, both of these fit.  If VH1 made a Most Awesomely Bad Movie list, Kill Bill would be at the top of the list.
B00005JOYA|3.0|This is a tricky one...Fans of the game are going to be divided over the slight liberties taken with the plot, but more than likely they should be extremely pleased to see that Silent Hill the movie is the most faithful game-to-film adaptation ever seen up to now. Whole passages of action and imagery and sometimes even camera angles have been faithfully reproduced on screen, so the atmosphere of the original game has been in part quite successfully recreated. More difficult though, is assessing the movie's success as a stand-alone product and not just a fan's wet dream of seeing Playstation graphics come to life. The biggest hurdle to overcome was actually decyphering the original confusing plot and turning it into a coherent screenplay. Well, just understanding the plot is hard enough, and as someone who has played the game and read up on a few plot explanations myself, I still can't relate a clear version of it to anyone else.<br /><br />But let's start with the basics. A couple find that their young daughter is beset by nightmares and sleepwalking, and she's constantly crying out the name \\"Silent Hill\\" during the more upsetting night-time episodes. So the mother, Rose, decides to cart the girl off to the town of Silent Hill in an attempt to and trace the root cause behind it all. Now, there's a rather unnecessary sub-plot introduced here in which Rose's husband disagrees with her decision and then tries to follow her, which actually does the film a dis-service. Because, as we follow Rose's trip into a nightmare and fall under the spell of the subsequent horrific imagery, the film constantly snaps us out of it every 20 minutes or so to show us Sean Bean (the husband) trawling the internet from his comfortable living room, or driving around in his car or getting mixed up with less than helpful officers of the law. This really hurts the flow of the the film, although it may have been against the original plan as I have read that the whole husband idea was a late addition to the film after initial feedback pointed out there were no male characters in the film! They could have got round that one by keeping the main character as Harry Mason, rather than changing it from father to mother and thus creating the character of Rose.<br /><br />That's not to say I don't like Rose, and when the film is concentrating on her Silent Hill nightmare, its capable of being quite a dazzling horror film. Rose stumbles across many ghastly sights and locations, and is chased and attacked by twisted monsters such as the \\"body-bag\\" monsters and faceless nurses from Silent Hill 2, and the cockroaches and babies from Silent Hill 1. The locations are also brilliantly recreated, including the school and hospital, plus the industrial, metal clad \\"otherworld\\" version of the town that keeps popping up. I really wanted to see the amusement park too, but sadly this has been omitted.  Anyway, if you concentrate hard enough you should just about be able to work out the film's explanation for the whole grisly nightmare, but be warned that they don't make it easy for you. How many versions of Alessa / Sharon are there supposed to be? What exactly happened in that terrific-looking but garbled flashback? As one who played the game, I thought I would be able to fill in any blanks myself, but I was dismayed to discover that the film script actually changed one of the core elements of the denoument...which was:<br /><br />(SPOLIER AHEAD - only for people who have seen both the game and the film, or don't care!!)<br /><br />In the game, Dahlia Gillespie tortured her own daughter Alessa in an attempt to draw Cheryl back to Silent Hill, because she needed both girls to bring about the birth of the demon god Samael. But in the film, Alessa was burned alive by puritan witch hunters, and Dahlia was the innocent mother driven to madness by the loss of her child. Quite a switcheroo of character and motivations there for Dahlia! The character is little more than a wailing harridan in the film, and instead the main baddie is a religious cult leader played by Alice Krige. I love Alice Krige and would have enjoyed seeing her take the role of Dahlia - if it had been the rather more devious Dahlia from the game.<br /><br />(Spoiler over.)<br /><br />But the sad truth is that this is a bewildering experience for gamers and un-prepared cinemagoers alike. There's some powerful imagery here, like Alessa rising up out of the ground in her hospital bed and unleashing barbed wire on the terrified onlookers, but it would have helped the film if much more of it could be understood. Some of the shock sights like the disfigured nurse (Lisa Garland, it is assumed) and Pyramid Head (yay!!) are thrown in with very little explanation, which just jars the viewer still further. I had a lot of high hopes for this movie, and it came pretty close to satisfying them on some occasions - I was squirming in my seat with delight when I heard original music from the games playing up there on the screen. But it failed to fill me with the same horror that I experienced when playing the game, and I think it will also fail to manage it with new-comers to the story, which is a shame becasue there's a disturbing and unique tale in there somewhere. Maybe it was just too hard to crystallize into a motion picture. But they sure tried, and for that I am impressed.ling harridan in the film, and instead the main baddie is a religious cult leader played by Alice Krige.

0670032506|4.0|I never thought I could get too much of David Allen, the productivity guru whose `Getting Things Done' system has transformed my work and life habits. But this book borders on too much of a good thing.<br /><br />At least, that is, if you sit down and read right through it. The trick is to ration.<br /><br />While I don't know whether the number 52 was chosen to give us a two-to-three page sampling of Allen's writing on a weekly basis, the truth is it works well that way.  I'm integrating it into Allen's famous `weekly review', the bone marrow of a productive work-life organism.<br /><br />In such small doses, it's good stuff. Allen and his staff have culled these reflections from his writings over the year. The power of `GTD' lies in its simplicity, so you won't find vastly divergent essays on politics, literature, and the price of gasoline in Idaho.<br /><br />What you will find is a simple and tenacious focus on a system that allows you to clear your mind and focus on the one thing you're choosing to do right now.<br /><br />On balance and in moderation, that's a good thing.
B00028HBKM|2.0|One previous reviewer of this movie got it right. This is more like an MTV, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" or a George A. Romero version of the crucifixion. Gibson tried to make a Biblical epic but instead he ended up with something that looks somewhat like a snuff film. Pretty soon, the long scenes of torture get so sick, you just can't stand watching anymore. Why is the Crucifixion suddenly turning into a 1970s horror movie with demons, baby devils, Satan, and gore. Sometimes the torture got sick, other times it just got silly.  <br /> <br />I can't even believe that church leaders let their congregants watch this movie. They even let kids watch it despite the fact that it was rated R. This film should be redone.
1931559317|5.0|Roger Sinnott's Pocket Sky Atlas fills a big void and vital niche- one that emphasises portability, usability and practicality. Everything in this little volume is extremely well thought out- from the quality of the book, the practical spiral bound layout, the scale of the star maps, clear and readable printing, intelligent and helpful labelling of stars and deep sky objects (you will appreciate the use of popular names for some DSO's), to a pure user friendly feel. There is even a helpful Telrad target scale and angular distance for quick estimations. Eminently suitable for the field, this is also a great planning atlas for astrophotographers and visual observers alike. For visual observation, this atlas shines when partenered with a Telrad finder (I really hate the flimisier Riger finder!).    The only place I think this atlas comes up short is if you are doing serious star hopping under the telescope. This is understandable given the scale of the atlas. I recommend Uranometria or similar atlases if you are a serious star-hopper.     Sept 2008 Update: I now have 3 copies of this Atlas! One I leave in my car and read it at restaurants during lunch break. The other is in my observing bag and yet one is one my desk at home. I love this atlas. This is perfect for astrophotography and weeknight quick sessions with my TV-85.     This little book stands out well to repeated field use. Mine is looking great after a year of extensive (and rough) use- no pages fallen off, no fade, no issues.
B0000028M7|5.0|In response to the post by John Schmidt about Down in a Hole being song 12, I too have the same track order on my Dirt CD.  I bought Dirt the day it was released in 1992, and I've looked at later copies of the disc and for some reason Down in a Hole is song #4.  This screwed up my WMA file when I copied it on my computer.  Just had to rename the files after it was done copying.<br /><br />The only song that I usually skip over when I listen 1-close is Sickman.  For some reason this song just doesn't grab me the way all of the others do.<br /><br />And by the way, \\"Down in a Hole\\" is about a breakup Cantrell went through with his girlfriend.  I know it sounds like a song about Staley's life but I read an interview with him in Guitar magazine several years ago about this song.  He was hesitant to present it to his band mates because he thought they might think he was turning soft.  But once they saw the lyrics they jumped on board right away, and Down in a Hole is probably my favorite song ever!
0312995423|1.0|This Dan Brown \\"classic\\" starts off slowly and never picks up any steam.  About 60 dull pages in, I finally started skimming through the balance of the story just to see how it ends.  It ends predictably, I might add.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code this is not: Don't bother.
B000002J6F|5.0|They may be different animals, but I place Manassas on the same level as that other one-off masterpiece, Blind Faith.<br /><br />After listening, I don't find the praises for this album to be overstated at all.  Like others, I wore the vinyl out when I first got it.  Like others, I found it woefully underrated at the time.  Like others I've found the quality of the music ageless.  And like others, I think Manassas has achieved what few others have:  a double album with 20-for-20 winners.  That not only says genius (consistency like that has to be genius) but integrity.<br /><br />To the one who gave the set only 3 stars because there was nothing memorable, no \\"hook,\\" it's not because the cuts are weak but because they ALL are so strong, so good, that no one stands out.  Perhaps an overabundance of quality has that effect.  Maybe if the album were more uneven, standouts would be easier to discern.<br /><br />And maybe if the band were not so perfectly blended and balanced, maybe someone would have stood out, too.  Stills, though playing the lead, lets his backup through, making clear to all that for these guys, what matters is the music.<br /><br />Go to a lyrics page and follow along as you listen.  It really is poetry.  And, speaking of poetry, how about that Dylan riff!  And those plaintive, trenchant verses obviously aimed at Miss Collins....<br /><br />Monumental is no exaggeration, because I think fifty, a hundred years from now, this wonderful set will continue to stand tall as a testament to American music.
B00008X5J1|4.0|Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York is an endlessly fascinating film about the primal period of Manhattan when it was truly the melting pot, or should I say, burning pot? It is an extremely violent film, but I was in awe of the film's pacing and set pieces. The world Scorsese had created is certainly a dark one, but it is so realistic. The story, however, is not as tightly structured as the film editing. There is so much going on that I became absorbed by the film itself rather than the story. The story is so simple that I had no choice but to forget about it, take the ride and see what happens at the end: A boy's revenge for the death of his father. Ok, simple enough. Now, onto the history lesson. <br /> <br />Although I marvel at Scorsese's mastery of filmmaking, I cannot help but think that some of his energy are misguided. I can understand that he wants to make a very realistic picture of Manhattan Lower East Side during the Draft Riot, but why glorify the violence? Why glorify racism? Yeah, we all live in a tough world. Sure, this movie is not about sugarcoating America's dark past. But why did Scorsese have to write scenes in certain ways that glorify hatred? For example, when \\"The Butcher\\" was making a speech at the Chinese theater while the Chinese orchestra was playing, he suddenly said, \\"enough with this music, now it's time for some real American music!\\" Then the Chinese orchestra was violently pushed away and the good old American patriotic music began playing. All the men began to listen to Cutting's speech and this lone Chinese guy in the crowd was singled out and pulled away. It is a very tough scene, very manly, very brutal, very masculine and very racist in a tough guy way. It is as if Scorsese had associated toughness with racism. Now that's glorification! <br /> <br />Do you see what I mean about this? It is as if Scorsese had completely forgotten about making a commentary and became overwhelmed by the power of violence, hatred and male ego. It seems like Scorsese cannot get out of this mindset. I was a little disturbed by this and I even hoped that another ethnic group would be treated as such (I really did not want to go there). And even when other ethnic groups were in fact treated unfairly, I felt sympathy for these groups. When the black comrade of Vallon was ganged up near the end of the movie, I felt a serious injustice. However, in the Chinese scene, I felt as if these Chinese people weren't tough enough to be among these tough men. Why is that? I certainly would agree that this is a very realistic image. But why not allow the movie audience to sympathize with this Chinese orchestra? Why not let us feel as if they were treated unfairly? <br /> <br />I don't know, maybe I am a little too sensitive. Gangs of New York is a good movie, but certainly a little misguided. Scorsese should had given us something to think about, not to cheer on the brutality of white male ego. Yeah, it is cool and tough, but not when this sort of movie is created by such an influential filmmaker. It is unfortunate I sat through this movie hoping that an all ethnic group would be beaten by these gangs. And I guess it is ok if these white gangs were clobbering this ethnic group as long as other ethnic groups were clobbered in the same manner? Now that's a big relief! Whew! <br /> <br />Hatred is a vicious cycle...But beyond all of this, I have to admit, it is a hypnotic movie. I will have to see it again. Perhaps this movie is way ahead of its time. After all, most of Scorsese's movies are ahead of their time. <br /> <br />
B0006IIKS0|5.0|After reading a lot of negative reviews on here, I guess I can say I'm in the minority when I say this is a great documentary and I'm a even bigger fan(20 years and counting) after watching it.  I've never seen something about ANY rock band that is so 'in your face' and completely honest and totally destroys all the tough metal guy cliches.  James Hetfield chose to get help for his personal problems which, in turn, saved the band that him and Lars Ulrich started in 1982 as teenagers which, in turn, will let us(the fans) continuing listening to thier music.  I actually liked 'St Anger' but I hope the next CD with Rick Rubin sounds more 'normal'(lol).  To all the people saying they did this documentary for money... have you even freaking watched the thing? How about the bonus stuff on disc 2? Reading those comments tells me you have not been paying attention.  It's true Lars comes off as domineering in every sense of the word but to any longtime fans, they should know that by now.  Jason Newsted comes off as a disgruntled ex-bandmember(hint: watch the deleted scenes), from watching this DVD, I can determine that he did not mean to leave the band and basically attempted a 'fake out' with the other 3.  He lost, apparantly.  I'm still a big fan of this band and I hope they return with something so powerful that all the people slamming them on here will eat their words.  They can't do \\"Master of Puppets II\\" so give it up.  They did that when they were in their early 20's.  do you honestly think these guys, now in their early 40's, can pull that off? I don't think so.  And, to me, that is not necessarily a bad thing and is NOT a slam against them whatsoever.  KEEP ROCKIN' METALLICA!!!

B000002H5I|5.0|Tracy Chapman is a true artist.  Her debut album possesses the quality and solidity that was lacking in many singer-songwriters of her day, and her songs are completely original and introspective for an artist of her years (at her record's time of release): \\"Fast Car,\\" the standout single here, is a lyrically touching take on generational poverty set to beautiful acoustic music.  Her devotion to political activism is easily apparent on songs like \\"Talkin' Bout a Revolution,\\" \\"Across The Lines\\" and \\"Behind The Wall.\\"  Surprisingly consistent and brilliantly outspoken, Tracy Chapman is an album truly deserving of all of its achievements.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road  deserves its reputation as one of rock's best albums.    Few realize that Abbey Road, while actually released before Let it Be, was the Beatles' last recorded album. That this album was made after the catastrophe of Let it Be, with the members fighting, not talking to eachother, quitting and then returning, is miraculous.     Despite the \\"Lennon-McCartney\\" credit, for the most part each song was written by one band member alone. Thus, you can hear Lennon's personality in \\"Come Together,\\" \\"I Want You,\\" and \\"Polythene Pam,\\" McCartney's in \\"You Never Give Me Your Money,\\" \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window,\\" and \\"Golden Slumbers, and Harrison's in \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\" George Harrison proves himself to be an excellent songwriter on Abbey Road, his songs competing with Lennon and McCartney's for the first time. Even Ringo makes a contribution with \\"Octopus's Garden.\\"    Despite their unique styles, the songs of Abbey Road join together in a beautiful, poetic way, especially in the second half. The songs from \\"Because\\" to \\"End\\" join together seamlessly, each brilliant song complimenting the other. The sequence ends with a solo from each member (even a drum solo from Ringo), and the famous lyrics \\"in the end, the love you make is equal to the love you take.\\" This half of the album is my favorite sequence of any rock album. It is a fitting encore for such a great band.    I like to think that the format of this album represents the dynamics of the Beatles. The four members had dangerously different personalities, styles and intentions for the direction of the group, as these eclectic songs show. These differences sometimes caused strife and threatened to break up the group, but often, as on Abbey Road, cooperated to make a timeless masterpiece.
0385484518|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book. It has \\"old man\\" in the title, and I thought it was going to be a drag. But it is a really quick and a great read. This real life story is very touching and makes you think. I read this in about four hours and I do not even like to read. You will either love this book or hate it.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Ten has the reputation for being the best, but this is my favourite Pearl Jam album. It's also their most 'unknown' album when judged by sales figures. But then again it also seems to be their most well-balanced one. Where on later albums (bar the latest 'untitled' one which I cannot fairly judge yet -it's awesome btw-) the emphasis on some spots is too heavy on hard songs or ballads, this one flows better. Red Mosquito, Hail, Hail, Habit, Lukin and Mankind are among their most memorable rocksongs. Yes, Mankind has Gossard singing on it, but it has an awesome riff and the vocals are good for that kind of music. Sometimes, Present Tense and Off He Goes are among their best ballads and Smile, In My Tree and Who You Are show sides of the band we have never heard before and have barely heard later on. The excellent packaging deserves special attention: Each copy came with a different set of lyrics/polaroids and if you fold out the side with the polaroids on it and hold it 1 meter away from you the darker pictures form the pyramid-with-circle-within No Code-logo. Try it and be amazed.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|THE BAND: Eddie Vedder (vocals, guitar), Mike McCready (guitar), Stone Gossard (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), Matt Cameron (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2006) 13 tracks clocking in at just under 50 minutes. The case is a tri-fold package. Included with the disc is a 34-page booklet containing odd pictures, song titles/credits/lyics, and photo/design credits. This is Pearl Jam's 8th studio album. Recorded at Studio X, Seattle, WA. Label - Monkey Wrench / Sony BMG.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Welcome back to the rock scene Eddie & Company. After disappointing releases (i.e. \\"Riot Act\\", \\"Binaural\\", \\"Yield\\"), I kept waiting for the band to return to its form of the glory days (1991-94). Chances are, nothing Pearl Jam will release past/present/future will surpass their debut \\"Ten\\". But on the 2nd tier of PJ albums I put \\"Vs.\\", \\"Vitalogy\\" and now this self titled album of Pearl Jam's in 2006. Driving guitars -ranging from sharp, distorted, fuzzy and even acoustic. Eddie's trademark vocals - rock, pop, soulful, bluesy, and at times naturally incoherent and mumbly. Wonderful Matt Cameron drumming - the normal songs and the off beat rhythms... a true master behind the drum kit). The first half of the album is filled with the faster tracks. The 2nd half seems to slow down a bit. Slow songs \\"Come Back\\", \\"Inside Job\\", the sad \\"Gone\\", and the Beatle-esque \\"Parachutes\\" are simply stunning. If forced to choose, my least favorite songs would be - \\"Comatose\\" with it's odd off-meter guitars, and \\"Severed Hand\\" (I actually love the chorus here, but I keep hearing a 'beep-beep-beep' like a truck moving in reverse through out). A wonderful return to rock/grunge/garage form for Pearl Jam. For anyone that missed it, Pearl Jam rocked on David Letterman the week this album was released. Great disc.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|Band of Horses is a \\"new\\" band, in the sense that this is their debut album, but these guys have been around for quite a long time. Ben Bridwell and Matt Brooke, the main creative forces behind Band of Horses, were in a previous band, Carrisa's Weird, for many years, but that band never got anywhere.<br /><br />\\"Everything All the Time\\" (10 tracks, 36 min.) brings a sound reminiscent of early My Morning Jacket, with a mix of The Band and Neil Young, and quite terrific at that. The opener \\"First Song\\" sets the table, but followed by the harder-rocking \\"Wicked Gil\\". The standout is the current radio single \\"The Funeral\\", a 5+ min. melancholic tune that resonates long after you hear it and makes you want to hear it again and again. Other highlights include the pensive, acoustic \\"I Go to the Barn Because I Like Her\\" and the closer \\"St. Augustine\\".<br /><br />If you are wondering where I found out about Band of Horses, they get a lot of airplay on the internet-only station WOXY.com, the best indie-station in the country, bar none, check it out. Band of Horses is coming to Cincinnati in June, and I can't wait to see how these songs translate in a live setting. \\"Everything All The Time\\" is an outstanding album, highly recommended!
B000028U0Y|5.0|Although hoarse on several tracks, and the presence of a <br />small # of duds, the force of this live performance resonates <br />with character, humor, and pride.  Johnny told it like it was <br />and didn't give much of a damn, and people liked him for it.
0688163173|4.0|Shutter Island offers an exhilerating, suspenseful and well-written read.  The tale provides plenty of second-guessing and unknowns, until the truth is finally revealed.  There is no fluff, tangents or lack of reality in this book.  Set in the 1950's psychiatric facility on an isolated island during a hurricane--anything can happen.  This is a great page-turner.
B000EGCITG|4.0|Ok. Like the rest of the P!nk posse, I was eagerly awaiting the release of I'm Not Dead. I was disappointed with Try This and was hoping the P!nk would return to form on the new CD. I can say that I was pleasantly surprised when I purchased I'm Not Dead. Not only was it good; it was a marked improvement over Try This and shows a certain level of maturity in lyrical content and vocal control. <br /> <br />The first single, \\"Stupid Girls,\\" is probably the only song that is reminiscent of old-school P!nk. I think this was an excellent choice for the first single. I enjoy songs that strive to provide empowerment. Not only is \\"Stupid Girls\\" a fun song; it provides a positive message which is refreshing in today's pop music scene. <br /> <br />On \\"Dear Mr. President,\\" P!nk receives support from the Indigo Girls. In her open letter to President Bush, P!nk expresses her political opinions in a respectable manner. There are a few songs on I'm Not Dead that exhibit a folk vibe. In addition to \\"Dear Mr. President,\\" \\"Conversations with My 13 Year Old Self\\" and hidden-track \\"I Have Seen the Rain\\" could easily find home at a folk music fair. The hidden-track was written by P!nk's father, James T. Moore, while he was serving in Vietnam. On the recorded track, P!nk sings the duet with her dad. <br /> <br />Two of my favorite songs on this CD are \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\" and \\"U + UR Hand\\". Both songs are reminiscent of 70's dance music. I think either could be readily find its place on top 40 radio. <br /> <br />The CD may require a few extra spins. Take the risk and you'll be rewarded with some great music. <br /> <br /> <br />
6302484391|5.0|Other reviewers do a fine job summarizing the plot and the reasons for viewing this film, so here's an overlooked morsel to savor: the opening orchestral number is the ultimate inside joke.<br /><br />The number Alfred Newman conducts had been used as the title theme for the Oscar-winning movie \\"Gentlemen's Agreement\\" a half-decade earlier. While the plots of the two films are light years apart, the title of the earlier one (which had to do with anti-Semitism) addresses one of the final plot twists in \\"How To Marry...\\" In essence, the orchestra's opening performance represents a droll set-up to this delightful movie's windup, but so subtly that only Hollywood insiders would be aware of what was being done.<br /><br />Funniest bit in the movie: a very lecherous Fred Clark foiled by a bridge tolltaker.<br /><br />Innocent playfulness with a great Fifties cast and well worth a view.
B00005ML1M|4.0|I originally saw this movie in the theatre and remember the tension I felt during the Viet Nam scenes.  The 1st half is an accessible, almost cliche storyline.  The rough strict sargent pushes one recruit too far with tragic consequences.  The 1st half is saved by the strong acting of Vincet Donofrio who is almost unrecognizable if you seen some of his other work.   <br />The 2nd half has strong colors and is almost surreal.  It differes from Platoon, which is a realistic portrayal of life in the battlefield.  It may not be to everyone's liking but it is certainly imaginative.

B000001DTM|5.0|\\"Achtung Baby\\" is the best album by U2 and perhaps the best album of all-time. All of the songs sound as fresh now as they did 15 years ago. The lyrics by Bono are among his best ever, and The Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen produced the finest melodies of any U2 album. There's not one bad song on the entire album. One, Acrobat, and Until the End of the World are some of my favorite songs ever. All of the songs mesh very well together and create an amazing listening experience. Do not miss out on this album!  <br /> <br />1. Zoo Station - 7.5/10 (Good Intro) <br />2. Even Better Than The Real Thing - 9/10   <br />3. One  Listen Listen  Listen - 10/10 (Classic) <br />4.

You may be asking yourself, \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\"  YES! Buy this CD and enjoy the remainder of your life!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears may not have the most likeable of voices, but she sure can put together a great record.  From her 1998 Grammy-nominated single \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to the present, this pop music icon is an amazing performer regardless of her mediocre singing ability.  Her 2003 studio album In the Zone is her most adventurous record to date, as evident from the sheer brilliance of many of its singles.  \\"Toxic,\\" of course, is the most famous track here, garnering numerous awards, including Spears' first Grammy, but Britney's own composition \\"Everytime\\" and Madonna duet \\"Me Against the Music\\" are equally delightful.  Like every previous Britney Spears release before, In the Zone has its low moments, as heard in the mediocre \\"Early Mornin'\\" and tepid \\"Hookup,\\" but the bright sheen from the remaining tunes make up for these two awkward moments.  Britney, in fact, has never sounded more electronic (save for the ballads \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\"), and that's sad--but she's never been an artist that is known for their voice; Spears is known for her amazing pop singles, and this album should be judged according to its songs not the performance.  Though it's not her most listenable in terms of commercial appeal, and it's definitely not her best commercially, In the Zone is by far Britney Spears' most adventurous, sexual and mature.
B000002JK4|5.0|I have loved this album since the day it was released.  I still listen to it now and then.  Although, it has a very 80's, dated sound I still love it.  I have savored profound enjoyment out of these songs.  They never fail to put me in a content place.  POM is still my favorite out of all his solo work.  Pictures at Eleven is a wonderful visit back to its time as well.
055358202X|4.0|I have been reading fantasy books my entire life. What I would call high fantasy, thoughtful fantasy, really good literature that happens to be in the fantasy genre. Robin Hobb, Lois McMaster Bujold, and more recent authors such as Patrick Rothfuss, Greg Keyes, Ken Scholes, and R. Scott Bakker. Ken Scholes is a must read for anyone considering these books. In fact all of those authors I have enjoyed many times more than Martin's books.<br /><br />I did enjoy the first two books in the series more or less. All of them are at times (far from always) ponderous, crude (for the sake of being crude not for story telling), and just plain boring at times. The third one was just sick on top of that. I almost thought and still think that Martin was seeing how bad a book he could write with the third one and still have people fawning over it. So I foreswore the series.<br /><br />But I did read the first three and then the HBO series came out, and set me to wondering. But what also happened was library lending on the Kindle. So the book was free at a click and I thought I'd try book 4. Much to my surprise the years Martin took off really did him some good. Or perhaps it WAS because he intentionally left some character stories out. Whatever the case the impulses to veer toward page after page of sickness seemed to have left him. Now the Bakker books and the Scholes books have their fair share of war and worse. But they don't veer toward TV type page after page of violence.<br /><br />Martin for the most part doesn't here either. The story was actually interesting and his writing on 'broken men' quite good. Yes the Cersei chapters drag on but I found myself much more interested in Jamie than ever before. Sam's, and Arya's stories are also standouts. I still intend never to pay for a Martin book. Not after the horrific book three. But this book was decent enough that I have already downloaded book 5. We will see how that goes.<br /><br />If anyone also fell off the wagon after book three you might want to try a used copy or a library copy of Feast to see how you like it. I was pleasantly surprised to find a story again instead of 'off with their head', 'no off with their head' page after page. Is his world as deep, his characters as vivid, and the plot as interesting as the authors I mentioned? No, not to me. But this is a whole lot better than book 3.ok three you might want to try a used copy or a library copy of Feast to see how you like it.

B000F8O35U|5.0|The Little Mermaid is one of my favorite movies of all time. I remember being six years old and wanting to be Ariel. I was Little Mermaid crazy. I had everything. So of course I'm going to buy this DVD. But I wonder why Disney didn't make this a Platinum Edition DVD set? From what I understood movies that smashed box office records get Platinum Edition while other Disney movies that did good, but not great get Special Edition status. I just think that the Little Mermaid should have gotten the honor of getting Platinum DVD status.
0440241901|1.0|I searched amazon.com for \\"women's fiction\\" and came across the hugely popular Sophie Kinsella. I'd read a few of her books in her Madeleine Wickham-avatar, and found them delightful. I figured I couldn't possibly go wrong with such rave reviews. Oh, what a disappointment I was in for. Can You Keep a Secret falls into every stereotype women have had to contend with for the last century or more. To me, chick-lit translates into stories about real women -- women who are strong and smart. What's interesting about a caricature of incompetent women who are incomplete without a husband/boyfriend/significant-other, and can think of nothing else? I know we're better than that!
0790731509|5.0|One of Pauls best.    Don't you love guys that try and bloat reviews with big words to try and make them seem overly important? Sorry pal, you're not busting up[ any party... Just causing people to laugh at you.    A if giving Adam Sandler movies higher ratings that this wouldn't get people to laugh at you all on it's own=)    This dude gave this one star for bad acting, but gave Friday the 13th 5 stars.lol
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD. I especially enjoyed \\"J'ai Deux Amours\\". I have been whistling it all morning. I also enjoyed \\"Don't Wait Too Long\\" and \\"Lonesome Road\\". I was surprised by the Dylan song: \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\". I do like Ms. Peyroux's version better. Yes - She reminded me immediately of Billy Holiday. Very enjoyable - all the way through. Hope there is more to come from Ms. Peyroux - especially in French.
B000089RV6|5.0|Can't get enough of it. From its awesome opening song \\"Hells Bells\\", to its title song, to \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", to Brian's big \\"F*** you\\" to critics \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution.\\" Like every other dude that has reviewed this album, im gonna say it again. Sex, booze, and rock'n'roll. Angus shows his godliness with his unforgettable riffs and solos, and the Brian shows the world with his screeching voice that AC/DC aint gonna die just cuz Bon did. Buy this album if you consider urself a fan of rock'n'roll.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool continues their evolution in sound and scope.  This is a great album to pick up, whether you're a fan or not.  They build on the fundamentals inherent in Lateralus; music that is far from the lame and catchy pop tunes that have dominated the radio air waves since the late 90's.  This is a fantastic album that continues to focus on perceptions/deceptions involved with control, the spiritual, and understanding ones self.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|Avenged Sevenfold is definitely not a band that can be classified as metal. Nor should they be classified as punk. Of course because of MTV many bands like Avenged Sevenfold have been classified into the two music genres, and that is the biggest problem I have with them. The typical A7X fan is an emo convert who is \\"looking for something heavier\\". I mean comon look at the other cd's purchased by people who have bought this cd: Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and of course the fake metal but \\"heavier\\" Disturbed. A7X fan's are upset because their parents have been getting stricter about their curfews and they \\"just don't understand them\\". Obviously their fathers (and some of their mothers) didn't have any music that was quite as heavy as A7X so they can't identify with this \\"extreme\\" form of music. I mean comon; Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Megadeth, Testament, Opeth, and Pantera. Somehow A7X fans believe that this band is going to join the ranks of some of the previous band's mentioned (and many more) with their incompetant vocalist, sloppy  guitarists and mediocre drummer. <br /> <br />Oh and if you want to wear makeup and dress up all black back it up with something real, like try Dimmu Borgir or Emperor.
B000EJ9VUW|1.0|this band is terrible. they get worse and worse and people seem to like them more and more.... <br /> <br />this is a waste of time, uninspired, irrelevant music, with paltry vocals and \\"drums\\" the drummer stinks....the name of the album is Drums not Dead and the drummer stinks.... <br />The pace of the album is horrible, the vocals are whiny and breathy. this band is a transparent attempt to seem relevant. just like all the hipsters from their native williamsburg, brooklyn residence.... i like lots of weird music. there is absolutely nothing in this album that can hold my attention for more than a second (this coming from someone who loves miles davis and godspeed you black emperor and boris, all bands that reach and break the 20 minute mark and still remain interesting)....in fact, after purchasing the songs and trying to listen to it in various situations (ie, as background, while working, while sitting back and closing my eyes and trying to absorb it) i eventually just deleted the songs from my computer... <br /> <br /> <br />i couldnt even stand hearing it when it was shuffled with 3000 other songs... steer clear and if you really want such \\"experimental music\\" pick up some 70's era Miles Davis. Miles should have named his last few albums Drums not Dead, cuz that group had some freaking rhythm. And if thats too \\"old\\" or \\"outdated\\" for you, then go buy some animal collective, or aphex twin, or boards of canada, just dont buy this and leave another review giving it 5 stars...please.
B000EULJLU|5.0|If you have doubts about this CD give me 1 minute of your time. <br /> <br />Tool's music is radically complex. When I first go this CD I thought it was a little subpar after the psychadelicly spiritual Lateralus. It has been 5 years and most us former fans have forgotten the patient ear their music requires. Every forum I saw the first day it was out was all complaints. Several days later that is all different. It is celebrated as a master piece. Buy this album (don't illegally download!) and listen to it 2 or 3 times. Then listen through while reading the lyrics online. From that point forth its inspiring tale and beautiful melodies and puzzles are there for your picking
0307277674|1.0|Much as been written and television has added to this, so I won't produce any long diatribe. Basically it is not a very good book. It certainly must have an excellent advertising agency behind it to produce all this media attention and indeed is undoubtedly making this author quite pleased with himself and well-off financially.<br /><br />The premise is an interesting one to fictionally exploit. Why not? It's only purports to be a mass-market thriller, not a theological treatise. Unfortunately, it is poorly written, poorly organized, and doesn't provoke much in the way of interesting speculations. As an historian, I find several mistakes only due to poor research, albeit these could be overlooked for the sake of plot - if one could find a truly enticing plot to follow.<br /><br />There are some remarkably excellent fiction authors currently producing works that can be educational and thoughtful and, at the same time, just plain fun for a light read.  Save your money on this one.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Wow!!  I only have two Slayer releases and they are \\"Undisputed Attitude\\" and \\"Show No Mercy\\".   I've always loved these two CD's but wanted more! <br /> <br />I was waffling on what to get by this band and was thinking either \\"South of Heaven\\" or \\"Reign in Blood\\".  My buddy told me to get the latter.  I did. <br /> <br />I have NOT been disappointed by this CD.  The songs are fast, aggressive, thrashy and extremely angry!  And to boot most of the tracks are less than 3 minutes... a rare thing for a metal band. <br /> <br />If you're looking for excellent 80's speed/thrash metal then this one's for YOU!  If you're looking for the newer style of technical/boring/over-produced crap, then take a hike!  Ha ha.   <br /> <br />What a great album!!! <br /> <br />(btw, I am not Ting-Ting, she hates metal, but let me type this review in her account)
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I mean no disrespect to Pearl Jam with this review: they are a band with an all-around excellent ethic AND Stone Gossard and Jeff McCready are one ferocious guitar tandem, to name only two among a host of virtues the band possesses.  I mean no disrespect to the enthusiastic reviews on this page: I'm glad lots of music fans are getting excited about something other than American Idol, for one thing.  Who am I to take away your joy having to do with a band who has provided me countless hours of listening pleasure?<br /><br />That being said, this is only an average Pearl Jam effort.  Nothing stands out as poor on this one, but then again little stands out as particularly earth-shattering either.  Contrary to what so many others say here and elsewhere, PJ really aren't stepping all that far out of the box they kind of solidified with _Yield_ four albums back.  And that's when this model worked best.  Again, don't get me wrong: I have a soft spot for radio-friendly grunge protests like \\"World Wide Suicide.\\"  But they already mined this vein to mixed success on _Riot Act_.  Noble: sure.  But I don't tend to listen to rock bands because they're noble or for their ethics or whatever.  If my fave bands have these traits, fine: As long as they rock me into dimensions I've never known before.  _Pearl Jam_ tends not to do that.<br /><br />The record forcibly starts for me on track six, the Hammond B-3 fueled midtempo piece called \\"Parachutes.\\"  The Beatlesesque feel to this one isn't exactly unprecedented in the PJ catalog, but the overall structure puts it on its own wave, providing for a pleasant and rich listen.  On the first five songs, I hear them doing almost the exact sort of thing they did with \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" ten years ago.  I can't help but wondering if they packed the beginning of the album with up-tempo grunge rockers to hook new listeners with more of what came before.  It seems we get to hear what Pearl Jam is all about these days from \\"Parachutes\\" on.  Song seven, \\"Unemployable,\\" is another mid-tempo piece that sounds natural for these guys, with sparkling guitar and intermediately depressing lyrics about a person with no employment abilities.  My favorite of all is \\"Come Back,\\" a gospel-tinged piece that has Eddie crooning with as much suavity and soul as Ben E. King.  Again, this is somewhat new ground for Pearl Jam, and they sound very comfortable here (best of all, there's another go on the Hammond).  And again, this is not an up-tempo piece, it is slow tempo.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but Pearl Jam is getting up there in years and they just aren't the rebellious lads straight out of Green River and Mother Love Bone any more.  They are middle-aged men with children and wives.  It is appropriate that they don't have many more convincing versions of \\"Once\\" and \\"Go\\" in them any longer (think the Stones--sixty-five year old men just shouldn't be making regurgitated versions of \\"Brown Sugar,\\" even in the age of Viagra).  Rather, they sound most like themselves when they settle into a groove and sing about subjects more suitable to where they are in life at this moment.  Fist-shaking rage just isn't it any longer.  I'm not saying they have no more furious rock left in them any longer.  I'm just saying they don't convince me on this release.  Their true evolution is represented on the mellower pieces that occur in the last half of the album and for these pieces alone the album is worth several listens.  And if you are prepared for a mix of more of the same with some more serious soul-searching from these guys, you should also shell out the money for this one..

B00005JN0T|4.0|If you're an Isaac Asimov fan, prepare to be disappointed. This movie is almost completely unrelated to any of his fiction. It mentions the Three Laws. Other than that, this is not an Asimov story. (In fact, it was originally written as an unrelated screenplay and then minorly revised to fit Asimov's book.) The film is, in fact, an example of the \\"Frankenstein complex\\" that Asimov wrote his robot stories to oppose. <br /> <br />Taken on its own terms, though, I, Robot is not a bad movie. The action sequences are exciting, the storyline is interesting and well-developed and the dialogue is snappy and engaging. Will Smith portrays Del Spooner's troubled past very well. Even before the whole story comes out, you know something's very wrong and are curious for his history. <br /> <br />The film centers around Detective Spooner's investigation of the death of his friend, a prominent robot designer. There's evidence that Dr. Lanning was killed by one of his own robots. As Spooner investigates, though, he finds troubling signs of a much deeper problem. <br /> <br />All in all, it's not a bad movie. But don't think you're going to see an Asimov story. This is Hollywood s.f. all the way.

0385338082|1.0|After suffering through the first nine pages of CYKS, I gave up. I'd by now started to hate Emma with a passion, and couldn't care less about what might or might not happen to her. <br /> <br />I just don't get this new genre of \\"chicklit\\" in which Bridget Jones and the Sex in the City women reign. I love to read novels with women as the protagonists, but just don't understand the popularity of the characters created by Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes, Jane Green, Sophie Kinsella, and whoever wrote Sex in the City. I just cannot respect these women - I find them ditzy, scatterbrained, insecure, and pathetic.  <br />Clearly, I'm missing something. <br />
0596007124|5.0|It's almost impossible to fail with this book. By just reading through (do not skip any sections, no matter how silly they look!), all WHY's/HOW's will be soaked into your brain automatically. I read most of Head First books(EJB/Servlet&JSP deserve 5 stars, AJAX -4.5, HTML-4), but this is the best by far.<br /><br />You are wasting your time if you are still reading the reviews here.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|In a generation where artists like the Killers are rare, I can't believe anyone would put them down. I think everyone needs to stop classifying music, I mean how about we just let it be MUSIC and not this....or that....or too much like this band, or not enough like this band! I'm tired of it...It's as simple as this...The Killers is GOOD music, It doesn't get stuck in a rut where you could even begin to tag a genre to it, and that's what I like. I mean I don't really go for what's on the radio, but when I heard Mr. Brightside for the first time It was extremely refreshing, It just wasn't like all the other pop garbage out at the time. Basically I'm not going to say what are the best songs because you buy an album to listen to the whole thing, and that's what you'll get when you buy Hot Fuss, an album where EVERY song is good, no fillers, all heart. That's what it is all about for me!
0440238609|5.0|This trilogy of novels is about a young girl named Lyra and her adventures in saving the world, or rather, multiverse. The series is set in a parallel universe in which everybody has an external manifestation of some facet of their personality, called daemons. In The Golden Compass, children are being captured by people called \\"Gobblers,\\" and Lyra must go on a journey to find these children, rescue them, and meet some interesting characters along the way. Along the way, she learns more about herself, the motives of the Church (the primary authority in the land), and Dust, subatomic particles linked with human development. In The Subtle Knife, Lyra must help her newfound friend Will find his long-lost father. They soon learn about an epic battle that they too must be involved in, and this unfolds in the third book, The Amber Spyglass. <br /> <br />     Although fantastical and mystical, drawing on many Biblical and mythical allusions, Pullman's plot is coherent and logical. There is no \\"chosen one\\" or anything like that; it seems more like Pullman could have used any particularly clever child instead of simply Lyra, but evens just drew her towards her role in the battle. Indeed, typical fantasy fare isn't overplayed in this series, and it's a great fantasy series for anyone tired of same-old. <br /> <br />     Pullman also has an interesting take on the battle of good versus evil, with the side of good opposing those in power and standing in the name of progress, knowledge, and free will. Likewise, characters are often faced with moral ambiguities and frequently deliberate an issue, instead of jumping to the choice that is an Inherently Right And Just Choice. He develops many of his characters very deeply, and their personalities don't seem forced, but flow with their situations and develop likewise. The themes of the novels ring true especially with the more humanist ears. <br /> <br />     Pullman's language and imagery are very rich, and would probably be worthy of some literary analysis. Ostensibly the books are for children; however, there is so much depth to it that it seems they would appeal more to older readers, and most of the richness would zip over young minds. Indeed, I anticipate rereading the series at some point.
B000000W5L|5.0|Ok, if you like catchy tunes and big hits, this album isn't full of them. However, it's the best of the stones albums and is one of those albums that you can sit back and let it surprise you.     Its a double album, and only two of the tracks ('Happy' and 'Tumbling Dice') feature on the awesome 'Forty Licks' compilation. This means that (unless your're already an avid Stones fan) you haven't heard any of the other stuff on it. It's cool, sexy, and rough edged, kicking off with the inviting 'Rocks Off', and leading into high paced riots like 'turd on the run' and 'all down the line'. It also has some great under rated tracks in their own right (such as 'Shine a Light', 'Let it Loose', and 'Sweet Virginia').     Generally its a conceptual masterpiece and is the one achievement of the band's that should convince you of their true talent in record production, and not just on 'hit' generation.     If you want to compare it with similar stones albums, like 'Let it Bleed' for example, there aren't no-hoper tracks on Exile like 'Monkey Man' and 'Country Honk', the album plays through perfectly.  Also, although the album has alot of excellent material, it hasn't been extravegantly milked for everything it has, and as a consequence is not over-produced.    It is, however, an aquired taste, and takes several plays to get into properly due to its style and length, but, once you get into it, you will love it.    Happy listening!!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars is easily the best show in the history of television. Everything about it screams \\"amazing\\". Everything from the writing, acting, directing to the score, music selection, symbolysm to the action, mysogny, mis-direction, this show rocks. <br /> <br />The twenty two episode set of Veronica Mars should deffinitly be put on your wish list at least, as it is even better then the first season. Many new characters and twists are introduced but all of the elements and continuity from the first season remain in place. <br /> <br />It's almost unbelievable all of the little details that are present in each episode which is why I think it would be awseome to watch all 22 episodes, back to back, over say a week or something like that.  <br /> <br />Trust me. Even if you haven't seen the first season, you can still pick up certain aspects of the show if you watch every episode of the second. You won't regret purchasing this dvd, and remember that season three of Veronica Mars starts on the new CW network in September. Be there to watch and support it so that when season three DVD's come out, there are a full 22 episodes in it.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|For anyone who grew up watching the original King Kong, Peter Jackson's remake is especially disappointing. It is far less realistic or exciting than the original. While the original producers knew how to make a compelling hour and a half long film, Jackson clearly has no idea how to do that in a three hour long flick where he does not have a lengthy novel to serve as his literary guide. <br /> <br />After a promising beginning, Jackson's film starts to go south when we arrive at Skull Island. This movie has much more action and adventure on Skull Island than did the original. This movie has at least five major action sequences on Skull Island. These scenes have some fun value, but due to Jackson's use fo fuzzily photographed, slow-motion scenes, they are not as much fun as they could have been.  <br /> <br />An especially disappointing aspect of Jackson's version is that his three lead actors are able to repeatedly survive falling into ravines, numerous waves of attacking monsters and a dinosaur stampede without suffering even so much as a single injury. The remainder of the ship's crew perish, but the impossibility of the three lead actors being able to survive and thrive under those circumstances is a massive violation of the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoying a film such as this.  <br /> <br />Fundamentally, King Kong is not an action flick but rather a love story between the great ape and the beautiful blonde. This aspect of Jackson's film is poorly handled and gets pretty sappy.  <br /> <br />Basically, fans of the original King Kong are well advised to leave this one alone.

B000EULJLU|1.0|I am beyond dissapointed with the latest Tool record, which admittidly stunned me considerably.  I have been a fan of Tool since the release of Opiate, and have thoroughly enjoyed the progression of the band through their subsequent records.  The music became increasingly complex as their songs ventured well beyond what anyone else in the industry was capable of producing.  They were songs that drew in the listener, begging you to analyze them, both musically, and lyrically, being perfectly composed and nearly entrancing.  Maynard's prowess as a lyricist was remarkable; his selection of words and weaving of thought on previous records, particularly Lateralus, is worthy of study in any collegiate english course.  This records falls well short of this precident. <br />The composition of songs is poor, to say the least.  Most tracks on this record simply sound like a collection of riffs that Adam came up with, and were hastily formed into songs.  The beautiful continuity of previous works is completely lacking. Occasionlly, you do find something on this record that hearkens back to the excellent songwriting that you have come to expect from this band, and then you realize that it a riff from a prior record; you will hear several portions of a song that were basically plagarized from Aenima's Third Eye. Maynard's lyrics, however, are the greatest dissapointment.  They are juvenille, at best.  His word choice is poor, the structure of his rhyming is abismal, and his vocal melodies, with the exception of the track 10,000 Days, simply follow the melody of the song, making for less then exceptional music.  Very little is profound, very little is thought provoking.  You may argue that the title track is certainly something worth analyzing, but this too is old hat; how many times can Maynard demand our attention as he explores his fasination and dissapointment with Christianity?  I certianly have come to expect more than \\"you must have been high\\" from the man who wrote Lateralus.  Maynard, I would express the same sentiment towards you, and suggest that you have sold your original fanbase short with a substandard work.

I simply can't rave enough about this wonderful show and all who are connected with it's production.  It's truly a gem, standing out brightly against so much of the absolute junk on television today.<br /><br />It's never too late to become a fan of a fantastic show - if you're not yet familiar with Veronica Mars, I'd highly recommend you give it a chance.  If you enjoy witty, well-written television, this show is a MUST SEE.

B00005JOFQ|4.0|Okay--I LIVE in Wyoming, and first off, there are just too many cowboy hats. Here is a great irony: this movie tries to overcome stereotypes about gays, when the movie is 80% stereotype itself (read on--I still loved it--I just want to set the record straight).  It's so ridiculous.  Did Ang Lee even visit Wyoming?  Or just drive through to Alberta imagining every stereotype possible?  You just don't see that many cowboy hats (admittedly, I wear one, nearly alone among any neighbors or coworkers), whereas in the movie hardly anybody doesn't wear one.  And frankly, I don't know where they got the dialog coach (not from Wyoming, certainly) but few people in Wyoming have discernable accents, either, any more than any western state.  You might hear Spanish accents, Greek, even Italian any place in the state, but not that thick drawl that sounds more like somebody playing an old record too slow.<br /><br />Secondly, though this does not relate to stereotype but my own sense of taste, if Ang Lee had omitted the sex scene--or at least done it with discretion and omitted the nearly pornographic detail--the movie might have been an order of magnitude better.<br /><br />That said: gosh, I love it; I've seen it a bazillion times and even surfeit cannot drive the haunting melancholy from my mind.  I wouldn't recommend it to anybody unless they already knew what they were getting in to--it is by no means a FAMILY movie--but it plucked a strong chord with me.  I bought it as soon as it was out on DVD and have watched it (or portions thereof) nearly every night.  Painful, lovely, haunting--I have a new adjective after every viewing--but, like Jack said, I simply cannot quit it.  I wake in the night with lines or music from it in my mind.  That must say something about the movie!

Because there are so many stories/scenarios to choose from, we can find favorite topics and pick long or short stories depending on time and tiredness!

B0009R1T7M|5.0|This is a really good album from a fairly new and  interesting artist. The songs are very poetic. I have always been one of those people that really listened to the lyrics in a song. I find this a very unique type of album.Not only are the lyrics original, but so is the music. I like the softness of the songs here. I don't like albums where people yell at the top of their lungs, yet have nothing to say. I see Sufjan Stevens as a thinking person, who is in touch with the world around him. My three favorite songs are the silly \\"Night Zombies\\", the title track \\"Come On! Feel the Illinoise\\" and the most serious one \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\". This is a really good and varied album. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Waiting for Tool to release an album can be an odd experience, especially if you happen to be a relative newcomer to the band's legion of fans. On one hand you are curious about the musical direction the band has embarked on whilst making the album; if anything, listening to Tool's album in chronological order bears testament to this. On the other, there is the odd mixture of information, disinformation, rumours, hearsay and whatnot, much of it, to the delight of the fans themselves, originating from the band itself (Maynard even issued a statement on the Internet saying that the people who downloaded the album ahead of the release date would be very surprised come May 2nd, leading many to assume that this was a decoy). So it was against this background that Tool's latest offering, 10,000 Days came into the horizon. <br /> <br />The title, and the subsequent release of the track-listing, generated even more rumours. 10,000 Days? That title was almost normal by Tool standards. Consider the previous albums, EPs, etc - Undertow, Opiate, ?nima, Salival and Lateralus - and you begin to see how the title 10,000 Days seems almost out of place in their discography. <br /> <br />No matter. The album leaked on the Internet and, like bees are drawn to honey, was downloaded by those who have waited years for something new from Tool. I was amongst those who downloaded. <br /> <br />Vicarious, the opening track, is an odd song that will grow on most listeners. Upon hearing it for the first time, I was disappointed. Maynard's vocals sounded muffled and the song sounded like something that was deemed inappropriate for Lateralus. Subsequent listens have resulted in this becoming probably my favourite offering of the album. <br /> <br />From this odd beginning, the album begins to take shape and the path Tool travelled becomes increasingly clear. Up until ?nima, it was clear that this was a band that was pissed off, certainly Maynard was. Lateralus saw them channelling the anger intoa musical plain that can be described as ambient. The angry riffs and vocals were still there, but there was space for the listener to soak him or herself in before letting the anger take hold - sort of like Physical Graffiti Led Zeppelin meets Dark Side era Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />With 10,000 Days, it is different. The ambience is, thankfully, still there, but the attitude is missing. In comes an odd grasp of melody that was previously missing. When the listener first realizes this, it is disorienting, but - at the risk of repeating myself - subsequent listens are required to come to terms with it. And when that happens, it is a glorious feeling. <br /> <br />Central to this new sound - if I could call it that - is Maynard's vocals. He was always angry - with society, with its materialism - but here he is vulnerable, and with the vulnerability comes a new dimension to his vocals. No where is this more evident than in the song titled The Pot. Drug references aside, it contains a vocal performance that is wonderful. If drummer, Danny Carrey's drumming made Lateralus, then Maynard deserves the credit for making 10,000 Days a beautiful experience. <br /> <br />As for Danny himself, he is to Tool what John Bonham was to Led Zeppelin and what Keith Moon was to The Who. His odd rhythm patterns recall Lateralus, but it is evident that he continues to grow as an artist. Adam Jones and Justin Chancellor do their thing, but remain in the background. Adam, in particular, is very restrained with his lead work, conscious that there were greater things at play. <br /> <br />10,000 Days demands multiple listens, more so than Lateralus did. But that is the great thing about Tool; they take us where their vision - their pretentiousness - leads and we follow. With Days, like with Lateralus, we don't complain. <br /> <br />I probably won't with 10,000 Days as my MP3 player continues to play it on repeat. <br /> <br />It's been worth the wait, ladies and gents. <br /> <br />Theena Kumaragurunathan, May 2006.
0316168815|3.0|this book was so moving. it deals with the murder of this young girl in graphic and honest ways, refusing to sugar-coat it. i sobbed through a lot of it- which i never do - and found the pain so real and complicated. toward the end of the book, the author writes a scene that feels like a betrayal. it reverses everything that was so well done in the first 300 pages in a 'and then she woke up and none of it had happened' sort of way. it undermined my investment in these characters and seemed to dismiss the reality of what is lost when a child dies. i wanted to rip those pages right out of the book. without them, the story would deserve 5 stars. their inclusion cheats the reader out of a truthful depiction of grief without a fantasy cushion that doesn't really exist.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I have fallen in love with this movie and now with the soundtrack.  As you listen it casts a spell over you, and shuts out everything except the music and the emotion.  From the innocence of \\"Going to School\\" to the drama of \\"the Fire Scene and the Coming of War\\" it enchants and pulls you in.  Listening to this CD is almost like meditation.  I will buy another so I don't have to keep switching between my home stereo and my car.<br /><br />Many thanks to John Williams for sharing his genius, again, and to Yo Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman for heartfelt performances.
B000FDECGA|3.0|This film is actually parts 1 and 2 of the \\"Lone Wolf and Cub\\" series spliced together.  Additionally, the plot has been simplified, and the dialogue has been altered, in order to make it more easily understandable to American audiences.   <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor.  Forego this and get parts 1 through 6 of the entire series.  If you love this movie, then you'll love all of the others, too. <br /> <br />You will have to read subtitles, though.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is a more \\"realistic\\" High School Nerd movie - realistic in that Napoleon isn't a particularly stylized nerd.  His clothing is unique, perhaps, but there are tons of adolescent guys who draw fantasy creatures, sulk, never appear to pay attention, act awkwardly with girls, and/or never quite clue into the intricacies of social interaction.<br /><br />For those viewers who enjoy plot-driven action movies: this is not the film for you.  It essentially has no plot and is, rather, a series of vignettes and sight gags about a high school boy whose small-town life in Idaho is both mundane and bizarrly embarrassing.  As the commentary states, most of these vignettes are based on people and things that actually happened to the actors/writers/directors, as hard as that is to believe (i.e., the time machine bit).<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite is filmed almost in documentary style, which lends a certain wry, understated quality to the many, many sight gags the viewer is treated to.  The movie parodies the absurdity of people and life, but much more intelligently than most other comedies.  This is not Dumb and Dumber.<br /><br />While watching this movie, I continually asked my husband, \\"What the heck is this about?\\"  Napoleon Dynamite is original filmmaking and rather difficult to describe or even, sometimes, comprehend.  But it is funny and it is well done.  And the explanations the writers/directors/actors give in the commentary add a level of humor to the whole experience as well.<br /><br />One last observation: that is not Jon Heder's real hair.  Thank God.
B000001F9E|5.0|Pop music is a very bizarre adjudicator.  A band like Boston sells millions by pumping out a manufactured \\"hard rock\\" sound, bands like Journey, Styx and Foreigner sell millions playing non-descript, bland character-less pap, and Jim Morrison inexplicably gets called a poet.  Meanwhile, a band of brilliant musicians, which played with flair and passion, led by a true poet who wore his heart on his sleeve, Phil Lynott, gets cast into the ignominy of music dustbins.  Thin Lizzy was a hard rock band, and their presence loomed large over British hard rock in the '70's.  Lynott was your proto-typical glib Irishman and their influence reached everyone from the NWOBHM bands - especially Maiden and Leppard, to Metallica to the likes of U2 (Bono cribbed his share of note from the Lynott playbook), and early punk and new wave.  (Midge Ure, later of Ultravox, played on \\"Black Rose\\", while Lynott joined Paul Cook and Steve Jones in a one-off band called the Greedies, not to mention the likes of the Boomtown Rats.)  Heck, Wilco even covered \\"Cowboy Song\\".  \\"Jailbreak\\" is Thin Lizzy's finest moment. First of all, unlike most hard rock bands of their era and ilk, Lizzy could groove.  Armed with a great rhythm section propelled by one of the all-time under-rated drummer, Brian Downey, Lizzy actually fell in the cracks between the hard funk of the likes of Funkadelic and the boogie of a bands like ZZ Top.  One of the reasons given for Lizzy's failure to conquer the rock is that they were too while for black audiences, and too black for white rock audience.  However, just give a listen to \\"Angel From The Coast\\", a riff that Price nicked for \\"Baby I'm A Star\\".  There's plenty of sonic crunch - the title track, \\"Warrior\\" and Emrald all kick major butt.  However, Lizzy could slip into an easy groove on \\"Running Back\\", while,  Lynott spreads his Van Morrison influences all over the place on \\"Romeo And The Lonely Girl\\".  And, Lynott could always turn a phrase with charisma, as in the gentle plea for racial harmony in \\"Fight Or Fall\\".  And, of course, there's one of the greatest songs ever written, \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\", a song that distills all of Lynott's Springsteen influence into a tidy \\"back with my crew and life's good\\" sentiment.  \\"Won't be long 'til summer comes, now that the boys are here again\\", indeed!
B0006J28L4|5.0|Living in Atlanta during the late 80s and early 90s, I saw the fury that this film's release tapped.  I saw \\"X\\" paraphernalia everywhere - on hats, t-shirts, bumper stickers, you name it.  Malcolm X was (and still is) the hero of disenfranchised blacks in the Atlantan suburbs where I lived.  In fact, the famous Rodney King riots happenned around this time, and I saw firsthand the carnage and destruction wrought from such long-simmering anger and frustration.  I was steeped in it.  Of course, it didn't help that I'm considered white (technically I'm part-Latin, but this rarely matters in a majority-black setting).   <br /> <br />I saw the simmering, sullen hatred from dozens of pairs of eyes whenever I walked as a teen down the public sidewalks or boarded a MARTA bus, so I know how real and burning this kind of thing is. <br /> <br />I didn't watch the movie when it came out.   <br /> <br />I was in my early teens, for one; also, for the places where I lived, I would have been perhaps the only white face in attendance.  I was honestly scared to go, to tell the truth.  I lived in a place where \\"Gone With the Wind\\" was still foremost in people's minds - the slavery era had not really ended - and I was a sore reminder of a time that just would not die.  I can remember how scared and guilty I felt everywhere I went, though I had no clear idea why. <br /> <br />I had only known about \\"early\\" Malcolm X, his \\"any means necessary\\" motto (what I saw on t-shirts around me) and of his speeches about \\"white devils\\" and their systematic oppression of blacks.  I heard his name often in the same breath as declarations to \\"go back to Africa\\" or \\"end apartheid\\" (or even, \\"kill whitie\\").  Pictures of Malcolm X resembled the men exquisitely dressed in suits and bow ties (in the excruciating heat) that I saw on the medians of thoroughfares, ignoring me pointedly as they sold Nation of Islam literature and bean pies. <br />I had thought Malcolm X and his followers in Nation of Islam wasthe black equivalent of the KKK, so I figured it wasn't something for me to get into. <br /> <br />I finally saw the movie in 2004. <br /> <br />WOW. <br /> <br />I'm now reading Alex Haley's autobiography of Malcolm X. <br /> <br />This man has really impressed me.   <br /> <br />Denzell's depiction and Spike Lee's direction has inspired me to no end.  While I am neither black nor capable of understanding fully the pain of such history or its effects today, I was surrounded by its effects during my most tender years and cannot forget what it felt like to be around it. <br /> <br />I almost never buy DVDs.  They are a very rare, well-considered purchase for me.  Yet I want this one. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen it: do so.  It will change your life.  Agree with him or not, this was a man who examined the world without flinching and acted on his convictions; this was a man who was not afraid to admit when he was wrong and work to redress it.  This was a man who fought tooth and nail yet could think, reason, and even transform himself. <br /> <br />The majority of the learned have few convictions. <br /> <br />Those of conviction rarely have great intellect or eloquence. <br /> <br />Malcolm X was both.   <br /> <br />He was a man who understood what he was up against and what he had to lose, but did it anyway.  His skill was surpassed only by his doggedness; his impact was seconded only by his willingness to walk away from what did not hold together, even at GREAT personal cost. <br /> <br />Whether I agree with his faith or not, whether I agree with his philosophies or not, whether I agree with his methods or not... this is a man that I truly DO respect, a man who reinvented himself repeatedly after having invested himself completely, facing such tremendous loss and sorrow head-on, and never looking back.  He paid the ultimate price, and deserves our love and our respect. <br /> <br />Spike Lee and Denzell Washington have done a tremendous job here in re-introducing us to a great American hero, right or wrong.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Hostel Unrated Uncut Widescreen Special Edition...<br /><br />or... the same movie you saw in the theater.<br /><br />Waaaaaaaaay disappointed here. Not only in the edition of the movie... but in Eli Roth for not going all out on this one. If this is the real-deal movie that was SOOOOOOO bad that it was almost unmarketable... or whatever.... then the MPAA is really weird. It means they made him cut 2 seconds of footage to get an R. Jeez. Grow some, people.<br /><br />Not only does this \\"special edition\\" skimp on the gore and violence, but it also skimps BIIIIIIIIIIIIG time on the extras. One multi-angle filming sequence... one pretty long featurette, and a few commentary tracks... one with Harry Knowles from Aintitcoolnews.com....<br /><br />If anything they shoulda paid me for having to listen to that meaty geek spout sleazy fanboy lines at Eli Roth. Ugh. He mentions that he was the inspiration for Roth coming up with the idea of the movie because he had been looking online for sites where you could pay to kill people. The thought of that giant slug-beast breathing heavily whilst snapping away at the keyboard looking for sites where you can pay to kill asians is scarier than any horror film i've ever seen... Jeez.<br /><br />I'm guessing there's gonna be an ultra-special edition down the road soon. Utterly typical.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie greatly... no matter the rating. It was the idea to me that was more disturbing and horrific than the gore ever could be. If you're a hardcore gorehound though, this one just aint gonna do ya... go rent a Fulci film instead.<br /><br />Jennifer Lim is gorgeous though... that's fo sho.<br /><br />Even with half her face burned off.
B000EULJLU|3.0|First time that I ever submit a review, but I am so furious that I needed to do it. <br />4 freaking songs amongst the whole album, besides they are not that impressive, heavy or progressive. There is no atmosphere, at least not the one I was expecting so bad. <br />There is something lacking here, I feel like I picked up a CD which came out between Undertow and AEnima, what did these guys do? <br />We should ask them to go back to the studio and make a new album. <br />Why? Over 45 minutes of fillers do not make it up for me, sorry. <br />I really miss the complexity and the sounds of AEnima and the intensity of Lateralus. <br /> <br />
B000AMJDHY|3.0|Wanted to give a 2.5... I've been reading the reviews and am a little baffled. This album is good enough. For a first time out, I'd say they may have potential later on, but are no where near being super amazing or anything. <br /> <br />I'm just wondering how old those who are saying \\"It's the best thing I've ever heard!!\\" are? Or how much music you've listened to in your life?? It isn't awful or anything (anyone ever hear Hole's first album? Before Courtney got together with and dug her claws into Kurt? Dear God, what an awful awful piece of trash).. But I didn't fall off my couch and shout \\"YES!! Finally I have seen the light! This music is incredible!! waaa!!\\"...  <br /> <br />I think once they get older and grow up (and get life experience beyond a girlfriend cheating on them), providing they don't become a one-hit wonder, they might get better. I found the lyrics to be immature, while attempting way too much to be \\"deep\\" ... Though I can see where teens would like this. The lyrics really were too immature and meaningless for me though. <br /> <br />I was 14 when Green Day came out with Dookie and I thought their 3 albums at the time were the be-all and end-all of music. now I look back and see how silly and immature it was (though, still better than this CD.. They're music styles are different though and shouldn't really be compared. I was thinking more of the youth factor). When I turned 15, my music tastes changed and I got over it (though am still a fan)... But I understand where teens who are discovering their music tastes would like this. I can't imagine someone in their mid-20s or 30s saying this is one of the greatest CDs ever, though. It's impossible. <br /> <br />This wasn't incredible and it wasn't total garbage either... To me, the true garbage in music in the last 7 years were/are acts like Britney Spears, Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, N'Sync/Justin Timberlake, Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Ashlee Simpson, Pussycat Dolls (who told a bunch of hookersthey could be musicians?), Jennifer Lopez, .. oh, and Creed... I really loathe Creed..... <br /> <br />Yes, I agree that popular music in general has gone downhill... But for a first CD, I don't think this one is so terrible. It just REALLY doesn't live up to the hype. There have been so many stronger first efforts (and many crappier ones). So calm down kids and take a cold shower... ;) Or don't...  At least you're not buying Ashlee Simpson albums...
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Rihanna shows her Barbados-based dancehall roots on songs like \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" but there is plenty of pop and hip-hop to be found on her sophomore effort A Girl Like Me.  <br /> <br />Whoever decided to use a hot sample from Soft Cell's new wave classic \\"Tainted Love\\" for album opener and lead single \\"SOS\\" is a freakin' genius. The moment the wave of sound assaults my ears I can hardly control my body, I just have to dance. It's the obvious standout on the album.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album pales in comparison, but there are a few other great tracks. \\"Unfaithful\\" written by Nee-yo, fast on his way to becoming modern R&B's answer to Carole King, is gorgeous ballad from the perspective of a cheating woman. While Rihanna doesn't have the pipes of a Mary J. Blige or even Kelly Clarkson, the song doesn't require a large range, not unlike Britney Spears' \\"Everytime.\\"  <br /> <br />Other standouts are the high-energy Sean Paul duet \\"Break It Off\\" and a slow jam called \\"P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You)\\" There is little filler on the album, excepting the remix of \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want.\\" I have a feeling we will look back on this a huge step in Rihanna's journey to R&B superstardom.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I can safely say that 10,000 ranks among Lateralus buth lyrically and musically.  An amazing experience and fun to listen to over and over again.  Listening to the intrices of the lyrics and rythmms is like hearing a new song almost every time.  Is it just me, or does the beginning of \\"Intention\\" mirror the intro to schism?
B000BNX3B4|3.0|One of the least appreciated films of 2005 is Must Love Dogs, an upbeat romantic comedy about two recent divorcees. Directed and adapted to screen by Gary David Goldberg, veteran TV writer for such shows as MASH and Family Ties, the film offers a number of laughs and very little in the way of strained or forced moments. As usual, John Cusack's character appears on the big screen as an amicable and enigmatic personality. Cusack and Diane Lane make for a good onscreen pairing, but the script is somewhat lacking in its ability to deliver. Much like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail, the concept and the couple are intriguing, but the unmet high expectations leave much to be desired... <br /> <br />Must Love Dogs follows the life of Sarah Nolan (Diane Lane), a recently divorced preschool teacher attempting to move on with her life. Sarah's sister Carol (Elizabeth Perkins) is constantly nagging her to get out and meet Mr. Right, but her prodding does nothing to animate the borderline depressed Sarah. Nevertheless, Carol's well-intentioned act of signing her sister onto PerfectMatch.com provides a handful of prospective leads. One of them is a recently divorced woodworking artist named Jake (John Cusack), and the two agree to meet in the park with their dogs. The encounter is a forgettable one, but the two develop a mild attraction to one another. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Bob (Dermot Mulroney) the father of one of Sarah's students, develops his own attraction for Sarah, forming a love triangle that leaves Sarah in utter confusion. As Sarah's widowed father Bill (Christopher Plummer) plays the field with much greater success, it only seems to exacerbate Sarah's disillusioned outlook. But when one of her father's new female friends, the likeable and spunky Dolly (Stockard Channing) dispenses some of her own advice on life and relationships, it makes for a more interesting and humorous film. Caught in the lurch between two unknown outcomes, Sarah must choose the relationship that is right for her. But in the course of her hesitation, she risks losing the only relationship of the two which is truly worth her while. <br /> <br />Fun and oftentimes witty, Must Love Dogs has some great scenes and original one-liners. Based on the bestselling novel by Claire Cook, Must Love Dogs will never be confused with a deeply symbolic or Oscar worthy picture, and the plot itself is quite predictable. But the film manages to do the most important job a film can do: entertain. Although it suffers at moments from use of bad dialogue, it's not a total throwaway film. Like another recent Diane Lane movie, Under The Tuscan Sun, the mandatory gay friend with attractive significant other is present for relationship advice. That's just one of a variety of overused Hollywood clich?s the viewer will encounter, along with the coincidence of Jake meeting Sarah's father and Sarah's end-of-the-movie race to embrace Jake, of which I must ask, why couldn't she just wait until he got ashore? Because it wouldn't make for a magical romantic movie ending, that's why. Otherwise, Must Love Dogs is a likeable picture with many funny moments most will enjoy... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is beyond review. For those who have not yet experienced the true amazing qualities of this album , or who are too close minded to allow it to sink in, I feel sorry for you. This is as good of music as you will ever hear. Tool takes it to the next level, and this is coming from a long time fan. I havent listened to anything else since May 2!
B000EMGAGW|5.0|This cd is super!Mobb Deep are good rappers and with g-unit family in their back sounds beautiful.Don't miss it,it's fantastic!G-Uniiiiiiiiiiiiiit!forever!
B00005B36H|4.0|I remember being very disappointed when this album first came out...It just seemed worse than Aenima and Undertow, and many other Tool fans felt the same way. But after many listens it grew on me, especially after seeing the songs performed live. I think something about the production of this album is off for me, but the songs are unbelievable...I love this CD now. Not my favorite Tool, hence why it gets four stars, but still amazing.
B0007O38F8|5.0|The massacre is the best album of 2005 and is a classic!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Wow. This album is incredible. <br /> <br /> It technically has 6 songs, each a masterpiece: <br /> <br />1.) Vicarious <br />2.) Jambi <br />3.) Wings for Marie <br />4.) The Pot <br />5.) Rosetta Stone <br />6.) Right in Two <br /> <br />They all get better and better which each listen. Wings for Marie is divided into two tracks and Rosetta Stone has a lead-in track (Lost Keys) which works very well. Lipan Conjuring is somewhat of a transition track between the first and second halves of this album. Its not much but it doesnt detract either. Intension is a hauntingly beautiful piece that segues perfectly between Rosetta Stone and Right in Two. Vigniti Tres brings the album to a close with eerie sounds.  <br /> <br />I cant say enough about this album. The songs are like treasures that you discover more and more of each time you listen. To be honest, my first impression was ho-hum, now I'm totally blown away.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Put this disc in a player in front of anyone under 30 in the United States, and the odds are that they will be able to tell you the band's name within 45 seconds of the opening track, \\"Vicarious.\\" There is unquestionably a \\"Tool\\" sound, as unique as it is recognizable. Since the commercial success of their Junior record, Aenima, they have seemingly been given creative license to create as they see fit. Every record says something new about the band, and every record is strikingly unique. They release an album every half-decade, and seemingly re-invent themselves with every release. It is one of the mysterious strengths of Tool, that they can sound so completely different and still remain unmistakably Tool. Say what you will about the direction they take, they will do what they want. <br /> <br />On \\"10,000 Days,\\" Tool take a direction they've only explored in bits and pieces before: melancholy. Gone here is much of the visceral anger found in their earlier work. This record is...dare I say it...sad. The title track gleans its name from the 27 years Maynard's mother spent paralyzed from a stroke before passing away recently. It is unquestionably the most hauntingly beautiful thing in Tool's catalogue. In essence, much of the record is a dirge for her. He explores his relationship with her, his feelings of ineptitude, and ultimately, how her condition corrupted his faith in God. The mixed-metaphors and skewed allusions of the past are largely stripped away for a much more straight-forward lyrical approach. This is no mere anger, folks, this is the man's soul, bared and open. <br /> <br />Don't be deceived, however, Tool can still throw down some headbanging rock `n roll. Tracks such as \\"Vicarious,\\" \\"The Pot\\" (my favorite track), and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" are still Tool at their rockin' best. The atmospheric tracks (\\"Lost Keys, \\"Virginti Trees,\\" etc.) serve to fill the ambience of a complete album-listen, but are still a bit too much of the record. <br /> <br />My biggest disappointment with this record was the shift of focus off of Danny Carey. The drums were the lead vocalist on many tracks of Lateralus, a feature that contributed much to my personal enjoyment of the record. While he is still on top of his form in tracks such as \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"The Pot,\\" there are several songs on this record with no drums whatsoever, much to my chagrin. Listening to Danny play the drums is one of my favorite legal things to do in the world, and I simply wish this record would have had more of him. <br /> <br />The production is, in typical Tool fashion, spot on. There is dynamic range in spades, no evidence of clipping, and a complete lack of sibilance. This is a finely recorded, mixed, and produced record, of that you may be certain. Post-production is evident, but not overstated. Most notably used for the voice on \\"Rosetta Stoned,\\" the post production work makes this track truly disturbing when listened to out of some high-end equipment. It is immaculate. <br /> <br />In all, this is most definitely a Tool record, but a Tool record with a different focus. They are still making nu-metal, but-- as it is their right to do-- re-creating the genre. There is angry metal on this record, but it balanced by haunting beauty and tinged with sadness. A definite listen for anyone, and (of course) a must-own for any Tool fan.
B0000074BS|5.0|Ok let's just try to forget the butchering Ms. Stefani did to one of their songs and move on. Mark Hollis and company create a garden of lush sounds and melodies it's easy to believe this entire album was recorded barefoot lying in the grass. \\"Happiness is Easy\\" opens the album with a soothing bass line easing you into the album effortlessly. Before you know it, you're grooving to the tones wafting through the air like a butterfly on a leisurely journey. The piano in \\"Life's What You Make It\\" takes over bass duties and softly hammers the point home. Introspective as well as extroverted, Mr. Hollis just makes it seem so simple. Easy indeed.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I know many hard core Pj fans will be PO'ed at this comment but I have to say it. Wow, I can't believe this album is actually this good.  The last PJ album that I really liked was yield, which was great.  Binaural and Riot act just didn't sound good to me, especially Vedder's vocals. I thought he couldn't do it anymore, but I was wrong.  Vedder sounds rejuvenated and just rocks on this release.  The energy on this album is contagious.  Although I cant disagree more with the bands politics(I'm right wing Christian Conservative if anyone cares to know),  I like this very much.  Kudos
B0009SOFGI|4.0|The year is 1969. It's the height of the psychedelic era. Jimi Hendrix, the Grateful Dead all flowing and dropping hits. Out of the sewers of New York come The Stooges. Listen to this album and think, \\"it's 1969?\\" Unbelievable. One of the precursors of the late seventies punk movement, Iggy and Co. were lighting a fire underneath every man, woman and child wearing tye dye. If you doubt me, just listen to \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" for proof. Album after album, they delivered high power raucous tunes from beneath the grime. And if your only experience of this band and its front man is from commercials, then just stop reading right now and go buy the new album from Weezer. You are not ready. Put this on 10 and get dirty.
1400079179|3.0|This book is similar to the style of books John Grisham writes.  It has a fast moving (somewhat forced) plot with very little character development.<br /><br />From an entertainment viewpoint, the book's strength is the author's short chapters which leave you wanting for more.  However, it comes across as a bit too contrived and convenient.  As the two heroes of the book are being chased by police they suddenly have an ally with a bank official who smuggles them out of harms way with an armored car.  When things look impossible, they find another friend with a jet plane to fly them out of France.  On it goes.<br /><br />Further, the so called clues to find a code were right up there with a magic decoder ring (don't forget to drink your Ovaltine!)With all the concern over a heavily guarded secret of the New Testament and the ongoing chase, the book reads like an adult version of Where in the World is Carmen Santiago (almost caught, but not quite).<br /><br />Again, it was fun to read, but once the hype and the movie becomes history, so too will this book. What will not become history, though, is the need for people to get closer to the Lord.  I believe there are many out there searching, and that is why this book held their interest. They are looking for the truth.  It is sad and ironic, though, that they think it will be found in a piece of fiction.
B0000029DD|5.0|Sometimes an artist comes along and from the moment you hear the first note, you are immediately enthralled. This is Jeff Buckley. An epic album in scope and raw emotion, Buckley throws himself headlong into each lyric, chord change and style. Grace is the full length debut from an artist taken from the earth much too soon. Pouring himself into each song, you cannot escape the realism in his voice. The longing of \\"Lover, You Should Have Come Over\\" is a melancholy tune on the surface, but look underneath and you find a man stripped bare of all pretense and just says simply what he feels. This form of honesty is now a lost art in music today. Maybe his death will teach somebody something. One can always hope.
B000E41MS6|2.0|I grew up watching Doctor Who and was quite looking forward to Chris Eccleston's interpretation. I wasn't prepared for such poor quality writing, and it became quite obvious that Chris Eccleston didn't really relate to the character. Billie Piper has two facial expressions and is by far the worst companion the Doctor has ever had. The stories are mostly borrowed from such things as Pigs In Space and The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe. There is very little originality, imagination, or respect for the original Who concept. Plus, the monsters are extremely un-scary. Overall, this is possibly the worst season of Doctor Who and is best ignored.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is an excellent animation movie that is a timeless classic. The movie is a marvellous plot, beautiful music and remarkable art cinematography.<br /><br />My two young daughters are enchanted by Belle, who they see as a role model. She is exceptionally brave, very intelligent, unselfish and pretty and cannot be pushed around by anyone. She refused to marry the most eligible man in the village because of his despicable character and she falls in love with the beast because of its beauty within, not outside appearance. (The beast risks his life to rescue Belle from a pack of wild animals and he frees her so that she can be re-united with her sick father.)<br /><br />This is a moving film that has won an Oscar. It teaches a great lesson to children that it is a person's heart that matters, not what they own, their status in society or other outward appearances. This is exquisite entertainment for the whole family. Every kid should see this movie.
B000784WMW|4.0|Some have mentioned the quality of the images in this series.  I'd like to point out that in these older BBC productions, the style was to shoot the interiors in a soundstage using then-existing video technology, and to shoot the exteriors using film. This is the reason for the two \\"looks.\\"  Film was/is expensive compared to video, so I'm sure this was an important consideration for the BBC.  Video from 1983 is not the same as video in 2006, obviously.  The technology has changed (better and lighter cameras, better formats, etc) and today you can shoot with less lights for a more natural film look, for example.  Unfortunately, video, particularly in the older formats, has a much shorter lifespan than film and deteriorates more quickly.  When these shows have been put on DVD, you can really see the ravages of time (glitches, drop-outs, etc) as they have visibly deteriorated.  There is deterioration even if the masters were properly maintained, which they often were not.  It's literally a race against time for all these old programs produced on video (sitcoms, series, mini-series, you name it).  Much of our TV heritage is literally disintegrating!  I just purchased the 1973 BBC production of \\"Jane Eyre\\" with Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayson and although it is excellent, you can very clearly see that the original masters are not in good shape at all.  New digital technology has been wonderful for restoring film, but I haven't heard or read about this type of restoration being done on old video.  It may be quite expensive as well.  The American Film Institute and other groups have ongoing efforts to encourage restoration and proper archiving but I'm sure funding is a problem, as it always is.  I've also read that because of rights issues--DVDs and the revenue streams that they represent did not exist until recently, and often music rights have to be renegotiated-- sometimes films and series languish for years before they can be released again.  More time passing, more damage!<br /><br />I welcome any corrections or additions from anyone with more knowledge or technical expertise . . .amage!<br /><br />I welcome any corrections or additions from anyone with more knowledge or technical expertise . . .
B00005YXZH|5.0|Im going to start off saying that this is the first Wilco album i have owned/heard, and that its good, i mean real good. I must admit that there are certain tracks that have taken some warming up to, but this is a beautiful album. Jeff Tweedy's vocals are so unpolished yet there is something smooth about them at the same time (if that makes any sense). The music itself is fairly minimal, except for the distorted noise at the ends of various tracks, and makes for beautiful yet fairly sad songs, yet many are upbeat. In my opinion the best tracks are \\"Jesus Etc.\\", \\"Ashes of American Flags\\", and \\"Reservations\\". I have heard many negative things about the silly \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\", but i think that its great, catchy and rather poppy, but none the less a fun song that i can never skip. <br />This is a truely great album that i would recommend to almost anybody, so check it out, but i dont think the 30 sec. clips do it justice, and give it a thurough listening.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is a creeper. I've been patiently awaiting this release for 5 lllooonnngg years and I guess the hype has a tendency to blow up in your face and bring down how you initially recieve something this anticipated. I HAVE TO say, though, after a week of owning and dissecting, this album is a must-hear masterpeice. It's amazing how this band is able to take their music in so many different directions and still amaze. Pick this up, and give it time....you won't regret it.
B000001FTJ|5.0|Tom Waits went changed his whole sound for this album, changing incredibly from his previous 1980 release \\"Heart Attack and Vine\\" (not including the soundtrack to \\"One from the Heart\\" which was released in 1982). This album marked a turning point in his career; he strayed from the piano a little, and focused a lot on percussion. This album marks the beginning of his famous trio of albums hailed by most Waits fans to be his best work (Swordfishtrombones, Rain Dogs, and Franks Wild Years). This marked the first drastic change in style and even lyrics in his body of work thus far. With eerie carnival sounding instrumentals, to fast hard hitting percussion, to slow piano work, this album was one of his first to show how diverse his music is. It is also his first solo album released after marrying his wife Kathleen Brennan, and this changes many themes of his music, gearing less towards loneliness and more towards eccentric stories. <br />Overall this is a landmark in Tom Waits' career and an essential to any fan.
B000060OFT|5.0|My friends and I call this the DiCaprio version, and boy is it amazing!  I think perhaps this movie is a 5 star or a 1 star - in other words, you either love it or you hate it.  I definitely loved it! <br /> <br />This movie steps away from the traditional ideas of Romeo and Juliet and delivers something completely new.  Sure, seeing DiCaprio spouting Shakespeare takes a bit of getting used to, but once the original shock subsides the plot just takes over. <br /> <br />The amazing thing is that Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes actually manage it.  They pull it off!  Romeo and Juliet cease to be the protagonists of an archaic, dusty, old romance and become real people with real love. <br /> <br />One other thing, often overlooked: the music!  Each song is perfect for each scene - adding just enough, never distracting and never taking away. <br /> <br />Yes, the DiCaprio version is different, but that's exactly what Romeo and Juliet needed.
B000EULJLU|5.0|People who don't particularly enjoy this album seem to hate it because it is \\"different\\" from the previous albums from Tool.  But then again, haven't each and every Tool album been significantly different from the last?  I'm all for bands having the same sound they've had from day 1 of their careers, but Tool has changed for every album now, and they do it in such a way that keeps us entertained and wanting more.  Every new album has quite a different sound, but unlike many bands who change over the years, Tool tantalizes us with bits of old fused with the energy and sound of the new and tackles our brains with yet another awe-inspiring masterpiece.  From Vicarious to Viginti Tres this CD will amaze you.
1400079179|2.0|For a long time, I held out on reading The Da Vinci Code. A bunch of my friends & some folks at work were reading it and passing it around, but I had already read another book by author Dan  Brown and I didn't like it very much. Digital Fortress, written before The Da Vinci Code, is a similar thriller that takes place within a facility for super-computing, and it gets a lot of the computer stuff wrong. That annoyed me, and I knew that if Dan Brown's book about computer stuff-what I do for a living-annoyed me that much, then his book about Christianity-my reason for living-would be just painful.<br /><br />So I avoided the book for a while, but with the movie coming out, I found myself getting involved in more and more conversations about it. Friends wanted to know what I thought, and being the curious person I am, I knew I had to read the book to find out for myself.<br /><br />And I'm glad I did, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to you. I'll tell you why soon. But first, in this review, I want to tell you<br /><br />A quick summary of the plot, characters, and summary of this book<br /><br />Some of the things I liked about it, and some of the things that bothered me<br /><br />Finally, some guidelines for figuring out if this is a book you may want to read or avoid.<br /><br />Let me start by give you a quick outline of the plot: It's a murder-mystery, that quickly turns into a mystery about a secret that could \\"devastate the very foundations of mankind.\\"  The story begins with gruesome details of the murder of Jacques Saunier, a fictional curator of the Louvre museum. His body is disfigured with some unusual markings and symbols, and an American named Robert Langdon, and expert from the made-up department of Symbology at Harvard University, is called in to investigate. His investigation with French special forces is interrupted when a woman named Sophie Neveu-a police cryptographer who also happens to be the murdered man's estranged granddaughter--warns him that he's not there just to investigate, he's also a suspect! Together Robert and Sophie outwit the police as they escape to track down clues to solve Saunier's murder. The clues connect with secret societies and their rituals, hints hidden in architecture and art (especially that of Leonardo Da Vinci, hence the name), links to elite power structures within the Catholic church, and the quest for the holy grail.<br /><br />Now, if this were just a grail mystery, that would be one thing. But Dan Brown redefines the grail to mean a long-suppressed secret, that Mary Magdalene of the Bible represents the \\"Sacred Feminine,\\" a goddess figure that Jesus married and intended to build his church until her power was snatched away by Peter and his contemporaries. By the way, the book also contends that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a child, named her Sarah, and spirited her away to France, where her offspring founded a line of French kings.<br /><br />Needless to say, that last assertion bothered me. More than a little.<br /><br />Before I get to the annoying stuff, let me tell you what I liked about this book.<br /><br />First, it was a good mystery. Well-paced and well-written, it had me turning the pages, eager for the next set of clues, trying to figure out where it would all lead. I also enjoyed the puzzles, which were fun to solve (btw, even though it goes against my grain on multiple levels, there's a fun set of Google/DVC-themed puzzles on this site: [...])<br /><br />I also enjoyed the characters. They intrigued me, and I wanted to know more about them. Robert Langdon, to be played by Tom Hanks in the upcoming movie, is a dashing, humble hero who uses intellect, wit, and his vast storehouse of academic knowledge to help solve the mystery. Sophie Neveu is also compelling, although as the book advanced she got ditzier and ditzier, mindlessly serving up rhetorical devices to let the male characters launch into their rail-against-Christianity diatribes and monologues.<br /><br />Another interesting character is Leigh Teabing, a Grail historian and friend of Langdon. In the movie, he'll be played by fun-to-watch Ian McKellan (aka Gandalf, aka Magneto!). Teabing is interesting because he is so interestingly believable. He has an authoritative voice, and uses it to give voice to Brown's conspiracy theories in a way that they come off sounding solid, realistic, and entirely understandable.<br /><br />Many of the things Teabing said bothered me. The novel clips along pretty smoothly until he shows up. Prior to his entry into the plotline, I noticed a few annoying mis-facts and historical inaccuracies, but nothing too egregious, up until about page 250-ish. That's when Teabing starts to \\"reveal\\" history about the Christian church that's just not true. Among his assertions were that Jesus was not considered divine until the fourth century (not true: he was recognized as the Messiah almost from the instant of his birth; writings as far back as the first century make clear reference to his divinity), that the books of the Bible were not selected until the Council of Nicea in 325 AD, (also not true: the 4 Gospels in our Bible today were written within the lifespan of eyewitnesses of Jesus' life and death, and were circulated together from very early on; the selection of Gospels was not even an issue during the council of Nicea); that early Christian leaders were involved in a cover-up to conceal the sacred feminine (now this is just plain silly-early Christians were too busy hiding out and trying to not get arrested by Romans and fed to lions to pull off a conspiracy like this), and that there's a \\"secret knowledge\\" that brings a selected few closer to God through ritualistic sex (even if you leave out the sex, it's still way off-base, especially when you contrast the book's claim of \\"secret knowledge\\" or \\"gnosis\\" with what The Bible calls \\"epignosis\\" or \\"full knowledge\\" of God's love and forgiveness which is available to all people.).<br /><br />It's this kind of stuff-plus the pile-up of all the little historical inaccuracies, that kept me from enjoying the book.<br /><br />So, is this a book that you would enjoy? As a Christian, I'd recommend you read it if you like murder mysteries (but if it's a good mystery-read you're after,  I can recommend dozens more that are better, starting with This Present Darkness and the Left Behind series), AND you're secure in what you believe AND/OR you know the facts and are willing to do some research. If you do read it, for help with the research I'd suggest you pick up one of the many companion books that delineate the facts from fabrication, such as The Truth behind the Da Vinci Code by Richard Abanes or  Exploring the Da Vinci Code by Garry Poole and Lee Strobel.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to you if you're not a big reader or if you're not too crazy about mystery novels. You should also avoid this book if you don't want to be bothered with trying to figure out what's true and what's unreliable from a historical perspective. I would also not recommend this book if you're just curious and want to be conversant when the topic comes up in conversation.rving up rhetorical devices to let the male characters launch into their rail-against-Christianity diatribes and monologues.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Another interesting character is Leigh Teabing, a Grail historian and friend of Langdon.

B000EMGAGW|2.0|Well, the title of my opinion is said. I thought this CD was going to be decent, but the only good songs are Put Em in their Place, Pearly gates, and Outta Control remix. Even those get a 3 outta 5 rating from me. All these people say we give mobb low ratings cuz we hate G-unit. Not necessarily. Im not a fan of Gunit, and honestly is this CD was anything like Infamous or Amerikaz Nightmare, I would have bought it, Gunit or not. BUT, the album does not impress me. I was really hoping for somethin hott. Thought  wrong. Good thing I didnt buy it, I only previewed all the tracks. Havoc can still spit. Capitol P got too cocky. Alchemist produces boring beats. 50 is on over if not half the songs&lt;&lt;too much promotion. Have him on like 3, that would be coo.  But not 7 or 8. The lyrical delivery is not like it used to be. The lyrics alone are not like they used to be. No straight street  murderous rhymes like they had, especially Amerikaz Nightmare, which is my personal favorite of Mobb Deep. Great, they're makin more money, but they had to become 50's little doggies instead of being their own leaders to make that money. Sorry Mobb, but yall are sell outs. They're not Infamous any longer. They're phonies.  If they wanted more money, get signed somewhere else. Nas hopped on Def Jam with Jay Z. THAT album will NOT flop. Other than that, I support indedendent and un-pop albums. If yall wanna hear that, check out Immortal Technique, Royce 5'9, Chino XL to name a few. Anyways, I'm done here. Whoever likes this album, that's ya'll opinion. Regardless though, they sold out. ggggguNOT..phonies.
B00005JOVN|2.0|\\"The Poseidon\\"  does have a titanic cast, but please be warned: This is NOT a Epic Award-winning tearjerker. Don't expect to hear any Celine Dion songs or dead frozen bodies washed ashore. This movie was put together by computer geeks who knows what they are doing, and These geeks now works for Warn-A Brother Studios, The producers of the film. This movie does have a good ending; Only 7 survivors were rescued at the end. There's a high-brow to this movie: Stacey Ferguson (a.k.a Fergie-From The Black-Eye Peas) Gave us some affectionate eye-candy as the singer of the Big-Band that ranged in the new year-as the titanic ship has met its fate.
B000002KE2|4.0|130 reviews, what a joke right?    here's what i find amazing about the album. it's kind of chaotic, it's disjunctive. there's a lot going on and going into this album. it's like a whirlwind. i can't believe of the reviews ive read no one comments on the opening and the closing of this album.  Both standout reasons to hear this album.    If you havent heard, well.. what the hell is wrong with you? you must be 14 right?    wheels of confusion/the straightener starts and ends beautifully, it has some decent lyrics too. tomorrow's dream is a standard riff-heavy throwback to Master of Reality, mostly forgetable in my book, but there is a moment it shines around 1:40. changes, well you're in the mood for that or you're not. it's kind of just \\"there\\" to me. fx?  haha. whatever,  you be the judge.    supernaut! what a cocaine-induced mind-bending 1972 track. it does rock, scintillatingly, it rocks. you'll know it if you've been there before. Snowblind... wow. what a song. i always thought of that as one of their best. to heck with the references, you just know when you hear \\"let the winter sun shine on\\".  Cornucopia opens pretty doomishly, and from there, it just swaggers on in a condescending and bitter way. it's one of those you're either in the mood for or not.     laguna sunrise, mmmm. peaceful and serene, but in a very down to earth sort of way. think adam and eve without the serpent element and the blackness the world then descended into (you do know who adam and ever were right? sex-thirsty monkies in the glory garden!)  St. vitus dance? kind of like a hippy song gone wrong. sets the stage for killing yourself to live if you really think about it.    finally, under the sun/everyday comes and goes. ooo, so dark in the beginning. from there it chugs on in a self-serving, almost indignant way. changes to more hippy sounding everyday comes and goes which is also filled with social satire. comes back down to under the sun after a short and decent iommi solo and ends in agood way. actually ends in a very lovely and sad way, one of black sabbath's best moments here at the end of this tirade.    overall: a weird disc. much to gain at times and at others absolutely nothing at all. its a mandatory listen. give me vol. 4, sabbath bloody sabbath, and sabotage anyday.     Edit: i actually LOVE paranoid, not hate it.
B000002KDO|4.0|i've kind of grown bored of this disc.    the standout tracks are undoubtedly children of the grave and into the void.  solitude, might be perhaps the most poignant ballad by sabbath/ozzy ever... Maybe Not. INTO THE VOID, one of their best tracks ever.    Oh yeah, the acoustics are cool. children of the grave stills rocks everything.    Into the void, what a damn track. i love that f***ing song, worth getting the album alone. whos with me? sweet leaf and after forever just kind of annoy me, as does lord of this world. the acoustic tracks have a nostalgic quality but aren't as important as acoustics like \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" or \\"Fluff\\".    it's all into the void for me though. ;)
0671042858|4.0|Stephen King's, \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" was not the usual Stephen King book. However, this fairly slowed paced book turned out to be pretty good. The story of a nine-year old, Red-Sox fan, whose favorite player was the closer, Tom Gordon, touched your heart. Trisha gets lost in the woods and summons courage and maturity that many adults don't posses, to find her way out. This book took me about a week to read, however, everday that I picked the book up, i began to like it more and more. When I finished the book I new that it was a good choice to read it. Also, i would reccomend it to anyone looking for a quite-thriller.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|It rocks, it rolls, it moves me. Almost every song here is a winner. \\"Monsters\\" is my favorite song. The singing is somewhat reminiscent of \\"My Morning Jacket\\", some people think they are a rip off of them, I don't think so. I think this Album stands on the merits of the good songs. This is one of my favorite albums at the moment. I like the more acoustic songs like the ending song \\"St. Augustine\\".
B000CNFC76|5.0|Having read the book, the movie is not as good, but it certainly is entertaining and tells the story. Realistically, one cannot expect such a compression of many hours of storytelling into a couple to cover everything, but this video attempt does a great job.<br /><br />What is even more amazing is the followon to this true starting point for the love with golf that America enjoys.  Ouimet started it all.  Then Crenshaw plays first national competition at Brookline, only to top that with magnificent captaining come from behind Ryder Cup win there as well.  Magic on those links for sure!<br /><br />Ouimet overcomes many obstacles from father, his youth, his amateur status and social status as well, a caddie that one called a pygmy to outlast the two British giants of Ray and Vardon.<br /><br />The interchange between golfer and caddy and by his club member friend Hastiing and the club pro Campbell who truly give him the breaks needed to garner this historic win.<br /><br />The film cinematography as well as graphics, etc. is superb.  Especially enjoyed the graphics which showed Vardon tuning out all distractions, like the crowd, etc. were not even present.  The extra features are so good, with actual black and white footage with Ouimet himself before 1963 Open at Brookline.  Especially checkout the commentary with author Frost.<br /><br />More of these for hungry golf crowd that desires something more than Caddyshack.  Read the book also, as well as Crenshaw's: A Feel for the Game\\" and Vardon's: \\"The Complete Golfer.\\"
B000ETQRCM|1.0|I heard my first sample of Pearl Jam's brand new self titled CD when they performed Life Wasted on Saturday Night Live a few weeks back.<br /><br />I was excited for the performance. I wanted to like the new Pearl Jam. I was hoping for the old school Pearl Jam that was original...that rocked...that was cool to be into.<br /><br />What I got was a group that has lost its Rock edge. The performance couldn't have been worse. A bunch of guys that have cut their hair, gotten married, seemingly found more important things to do than make good music. It was a boring performance and Eddie's vocals were screechy at best.<br /><br />Fast forward to the CD release. Eddie's not as screechy on the studio CD, but the whole disk is not my style, nor is it the style that I was into Pearl Jam for on their earlier releases. On this release there are lots of slow, boring tunes. There are a few rockers where the guys during the recording at some point must have said, \\"C'mon...let's rock!\\" But clearly no real effort went into the rockers.<br /><br />According to lead singer, Eddie Vedder, \\"The name Pearl Jam is in reference to the pearl itself...and the natural process from which a pearl comes from. Basically, taking excrement or waste and turning it into something beautiful.\\" Pearl Jam have taken their great, original talents and turned them into waste. How's that for irony.<br /><br />Rockers need to take a pass on Pearl Jam.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This is quite simply one of the most progresive wide ranging and brilliant albums of the last 10 years. I'm not going to say anything more - just buy it, even if its the only album you buy this year, and discover it's depths and genius for yourself!!
0553062182|4.0|The great thing about this book is it identified a trait that had never really been discussed before in positive terms: high sensitivity.  A major aspect of this sensitivity is difficulty in social situations and a tendency to turn inward rather than outward, so people with this trait are known as being \\"antisocial,\\" \\"too quiet,\\" \\"too shy,\\" etc.  However, the trait encompasses so much more than this.  HSPs tend to be sensitive to most sensory stimulation, so find themselves uncomfortable in noisy and chaotic places.  Although Aron says that 30% of HSPs are extroverted, none of what she says about HSPs makes much sense for an extrovert.  These are the people who desperately need a calm oblivion to retreat to when the world gets to be too much, people who are drained by the hectic lifestyles that are so common these days and would rather curl up with a book than spend the evening at a bar.<br /><br />The strength of this book was its assurance that the trait is completely normal, not a flaw that we need to get over.  HSPs tend to have higher rates of psychological problems compared to the general population, largely in part due to living in a culture that tells them their personality and feelings are \\"wrong\\" and need to be changed.  Most books on shyness emphasize how to get over it; Aron emphasizes how to appreciate your strengths and live with what you have.<br /><br />That being said, not all of the book is useful.  Parts were difficult to get through; for example when Aron was comparing the body to an baby and talking about parenting your \\"infant/body,\\" she totally lost me and it was a struggle to continue reading.  The chapter on spirituality and Aron's claim that HSPs are more spiritual than others was not helpful to me either.<br /><br />The chapters on relationship, work, and medical issues were priceless though.  I constantly found myself knitting together the threads of my life.  Suddenly, it all made sense, why I had failed at certain things, why I had reacted in certain ways.  Although more practical advice in these areas (particularly work) would have been helpful, the book was most empowering just because it said, \\"this is how you are.  And that's okay.\\"had reacted in certain ways.  Although more practical advice in these areas (particularly work) would have been helpful, the book was most empowering just because it said, \\"this is how you are.  And that's okay.\\"
B0007Y08T2|5.0|Of all the Dark Tranquillity albums, this one strikes me the most in awe. Reigning as their best cover art in my opinion, it stands as a testament to Heaven itself.<br /><br />The opener, \\"Punish My Heaven\\", begins with incredible power and harsh vocals, but those intricate guitar leads are present with Niklas Sundin and Fredrik Johansson ready to impress. It was an experience that you do not often make musically...an experience that only leaves its mark...Being me, I disliked the tracks with female vocals on them more than the other because, well, I just don't like female vocals. I don't know why it is, but I just never enjoy listening to them. However, this album is packed with too many goods that other vocals become the least of my worries.<br /><br />\\"Midway Through Infinity\\" pounds its way through with intense drumwork and assault riffs.<br />\\"The Emptiness From Which I Fed\\" performs like an opera and has an intensely catchy solo beginning at 4:03.<br />\\"Mine Is The Grandeur...\\" / \\"...Of Melancholy Burning\\" fits together like two paintings side-by-side, too beautiful to say (Even though the latter has a chick singing).<br /><br />Like I said, this one needed some observing time, just like I do with all majestic or puzzling artwork. We find DT's old font (You know, that unparallel logo, which is fittingly at the top center). There are many portraits and canvases at the bottom, with continuous peacock feathers trailing across the right ones and branches across the left. The updated color creates a very brooding atmosphere for only a worthy record such as this. What blow my \\"mind's eye\\" is the way it trails into the universe like that, right into that supernova. Another quite haunting feature is the way the staircase trebles atop the gallery and amongst pillars and statues. It leads to a red throne, but it is just creepy because you are down in -The Gallery- while being sucked into the endless universe. Let us leave this by saying that this is the greatest artwork Dark Tranquillity ever wished to conceive.<br /><br />Recorded by the legendary Fredrik Nordstrom, you know this will not displease. This is also the first to feature Michael on vocals, as we all know. One thing to understand is that all the tracks here achieve greatness in their own right, which is why -The Gallery- stands as a strong, unified piece of the \\"Holy Trinity\\" between -Slaughter Of The Soul- and -The Jester Race-. People...Herein Lies The Beauty...to conceive.    Recorded by the legendary Fredrik Nordstrom, you know this will not displease. This is also the first to feature Michael on vocals, as we all know.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The red hot chili peppers double album mixes the mature sounds of By the Way with their funky roots.  I am a huge fan of By the Way(i have all the b-sides) and I also like Californication a lot.  I think the problem people have with double albums is that not every song can stand out as much as others.  Still there are a lot of strong songs on both discs.  The drums, guitar, and bass are all great and catchy.  Anthony's singing has improved on each album and the harmony between Anthony and John is great.  I have listen to the cd several times and it gets better every time.  If you liked By the Way and Californication, then you will most likely like Stadium Arcadium.
0553801503|2.0|With this book the Song of Ice and Fire series has completely 'jumped the shark'. What was a rather innovative approach to modern fantasy has now succumbed to the temptation of producing an endless series of epic books. <br /> <br />Long, rambling and self indulgent, the book has no discernable plot as far as I can tell. The compelling action and pace of the series so far has been abandoned in favour of what I assume us cynic attempt to extend the series and make more money.  <br /> <br />To make matters worse, the book just stops! Right where it starts getting interesting and things begin to happen .. with the promise that we'll have to wait for tweo books to get resolution.  <br /> <br />If you've read the previous books, keep with it, you can only hope the next one gets better.
B00008438V|4.0|The movie that played out just about any young mans fantasey between the ages of 12 and 16 (roughly) was the smash hit Wierd Science.<br /><br />Probably every teenager begining there sexual peak goes through that fantasey stage. Fantasizing abut the ultimate woman who is at your command, is older and more experienced and has nothing better to do then flirt with you in public so you can show off to all your friends. Only in this movie Gary and Wyatt dont just fantasize it, they create it.<br /><br />After watching Dr Frankenstien bring his monster to life, they condjur up a wild idea to make a computer program that things like a real woman so they can ask it questions to help them meet woman. Only once they hack into the army and gain more power (its a fantasey movie, you geeks think of something better to do then argue how its not possible) they end up not creating a program, but actualy creating a flesh and blood woman with somewhat genie type of powers.<br /><br />They call her Lisa and she helps them realise that all they really ever needed to do was be themselves, act natural, loosen up and have a good time. Just be yourself is the motto of the movie. And it's true. All those years of fantasizing and thinking you can never \\"score\\" (B&B) and fantasize about the ultimate woman falling into your lap arnt nesersery when you just be yourself and open your eyes to the real world.Also playing on the emotions of alination that some of us go through in life where you dont feel like you fit in, yet you want to.<br /><br />The cloths may somewhat have out-dated themselves but i think the movie will always be accepted in anyones generation in future. 20 odd years later, i wouldnt call it timeless, but it still definitly isnt a laugh fest at what the 80's dags where like. It still holds up strong today and continues to be a fun classic comedy.<br /><br />However; The cons about this DVD are the sound and vision arnt that great. It doesnt look all that much better then a VHSversion and the sound isnt that great for what claims to be DTS. However I can live with that, but I wont give this DVD more then 4 stars because 5 stars would mean it being perfect, and for this DVD to be perfect, that would require bonus features that are bonus features. Despite what the menu of this DVD claims it to be, a trailer is NOT a bonus feature. It wouldve been nice to have a reunion documentry, audio commentary, if any doco's where filmed during the shooting of this... something, anything wouldve been nice.
B00005JOE8|5.0|Ah yes, V for Vendetta. For those who value a movie with a message, this is perfect. For those who value free speech, freedom, and independance, this movie is for you. For those of you who would rather \\"watch\\" a movie and not actually think through it, this is NOT the movie for you.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is a clear message. A message and a glimpse.<br /><br />A glimpse of the future. It is inevitably true that all empires corrupt and must be overthrown. This movie is a reminder, a warning, and a set of instructions. Set in totalitarian Britain, where the media, the music, the news, the reading material and even the art put on display is controlled by the government. Those who believe this is not how it should be mysteriously vanish along with their families. This is not a movie for those who look at their politicians and their government and say \\"My oh my, those are the most un-selfish, moral people in the world.\\" This is a movie for those who actually see things as they are. Corruption will eventually eat away every government on this Earth. It just happens. All you can do is stand up for what you believe in. And V for Vendetta is a clear message to the people saying \\"Don't let your fear of \\"outside threats\\" let your government take your freedom away. Be ever mindful of YOUR place in this government. And as always, don't believe everything you see on television.\\"<br /><br />This movie does what so many other movies wish they had done. It outlines exactly how far a government would be willing to go to control you, and to make you afraid. Because when you are afraid, you can be controlled. So please, watch this movie. It isn't \\"Left wing conspiracy theorys\\" or \\"Left wing propoganda\\". Its the truth. And the truth can either kill you, or set you free.

B0009IW88A|5.0|Alot of the time the music, if not makes, contributes greatly to a movie's atmosphere. This is certainly the case with Batman Begins. Its an awesome movie, and at least some of the credit must go to the composers. Awesome music, buy it.
1573228737|5.0|I usually don't like books written in the \\"diary\\" format, but this one sucked me in and wouldn't let go. I sat down shortly after lunch to start reading, and didn't stop 'til long after bedtime. It was hard to tear myself away. It's a story that haunts you. Sarah Waters' style is lyrical, and the plot engrosses the reader almost instantly.<br /><br />It's top-notch historical fiction, rich in period detail from from the dull, grim life in an English women's prison to Victorian repression, it really does come alive.
0307263118|3.0|Max Morden is a not very accomplished art historian who has gone into retreat in a holiday home that he knew when he was young: the Cedars in de seaside resort Ballyless. There he contemplates several events that have changed his life: the recent loss of his beloved wife and another loss that occurred in his youth when holidaying in Ballyless. Max has all the time in the world and this becomes clear from the way in which this book is written: beautiful prose, but slightly archaic. You really have to work to read this book and in the end the outcomes are not terribly surprising. 4 stars for the prose, but 3 stars when also taking the actual story into consideration.
630471193X|3.0|It was exciting to see John Travolta acting so well again in a small-town setting.As far as the story went, I felt the wind-up was strong, but the actual throw went limp, landing short of the target. Somewhere in the middle of the story I felt the tampering of several hands, giving other parties more film time. Perhaps there were too many actors to fully satisfy here. Someone lost the nerve to go with the gut feeling and deliver a guy who could make serious changes and handle his super-powers. It was as if a Republican hand stepped in and decided \\"they couldn't afford it.\\" Travolta's character could have been better than \\"Charly\\" here and copped out. Rewrite the last third of the movie and you could get this off the ground where it lies.
B00008WT5C|5.0|AC/DC's \\"Let There Be Rock\\" is pure and raw energy. I always classified AC/DC in the \\"Heavy Metal\\" catagory, but this album borderlines \\"Punk\\". The loosenes and distortion just makes the speakers crackle with energy! This is AC/DC in top form and being exactly what they set out to be - Three cord noisemakers. Angus Youngs screaming guitar licks supported by brother Malcom's rythm's and Bon Scott's squeaky and eerie vocalizations are the perfect formula for a Hard Rock Feast! This is one of AC/DC's best. I highly recommend this album.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I think the world has to thank Ang Lee for making this masterpiece and for being brave enough to pick up a script that was being dubbed as \\"that gay cowboy movie\\".   <br /> <br />The movie, as I'm sure many have heard numerous times, is a wonderful version of the Annie Proulx short story and really does capture the essence of it and in some parts, extends the story a little bit more.   <br /> <br />The story of Jack and Ennis (and we cannot forget their unfortunate wives) is one that I can imagine rings true in a lot of closeted gay men.  Today's society is still fairly intolerant and homosexuals are often misunderstood, stereotyped and judged just because of their sexual preference.  Living in Malaysia (where this movie was banned), it is even more apparent how underground being gay is. <br /> <br />Beautfully made with sweeping cinematography (Ang Lee style) of Wyoming country, this movie is touching, heartbreaking and delicately made.  Through the amazing performances by all the actors, especially Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, the sensitivity of the subjects is subtley dealt with.  Some people I know have criticised the movie for being too slow and too contrived, but in my honest opinion, the pace of the movie was necessary to stir up emotions.  As for the movie being contrived, it is not the fault of the story that it makes people feel something. <br /> <br />All in all, highly recommended and should be viewed in full without any pre-judgement before opinions can be made.
B00008BXJG|5.0|What can be said about \\"Highway To Hell\\"? Most everyone has it in their CD collection. It's a classic Rock album that will still be played and on the racks 100 years from now. AC/DC is one of the most important bands in the past 30 years. The notch that they have carved out of Rock and Roll history is one to be appreciated, even by non fans. There is not a weak track on this album. It's pure and genuine. AC/DC albums will outlive us all, lets bask in the glow of their majestic presence!<br /><br />Long live Angus and the boys!
B000F6IOC0|2.0|Ok, I feel the need to start off saying that Underworld (1st movie) was a great stylized action movie with both an intriguing character in Selena (Beckinsale) and a great story line.  I watch it every chance I get and would highly recommend it.  I was really looking forward to Underworld Evolution... <br /> <br />That being said, I would not recommend Underworld Evolution.  <br /> <br />What made Underworld awesome was that it was telling a story of a \\"chosen one\\" but from the perspective of the guardian of that chosen one (Beckinsale's character). Add in it had great stylized action scenes (Matrix-esque, while still being original in appearance), a feel of a huge back history to the story, and very effective bad guys.  Now take all that and throw it out the window. You then have Underworld Evolution.   <br /> <br />The Evolution story takes the guardian and makes her the complete center of the story, without a clear reason why (beyond the fact that Beckinsale is insanely hot; she alone earns the second star).  This losses a key element that made this license original; as most people will tell you, sometimes the side characters can be more interesting than the top guys. Boba Fett and Morpheus are ultimately more interesting than Luke and Neo. Same thing with the characters in this movie. But something is lost immediately when Beckinsale's character becomes the top guy. <br /> <br />As well, the fight scenes are no where near as stylized, losing a great element to the story telling; though I am sure horror fans (which this movie CAN fall into that category, though I wouldn't put it there) will enjoy the drastic increase in blood and gore. I see no added benefit to the gore over intriguing fight scenes, but I will admit I am not a horror movie fan. <br /> <br />Add in the back story and the bad guys, the werewolves, take a weird Highlander-left field continuity turn that doesn't get explained properly. I don't want to give too much away, but even vampire/werewolf movie fans will not like this.  Maybe I didn't catch enough, but I doubt it. <br /> <br />I heard that both Beckinsale and the director (her husband) didn't want to do the same movie again, which I can completely respect. BUT this really is Highlander 2 to Highlander 1. I think anyone remotely interested in this movie will understand that comparison and save their money. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Not a good sequel or movie.  I can't even see an unrated cut making this a good movie. I truly wanted more from this movie, but I would say pass.  If you have to see this movie, rent it, but do not buy. <br />

0316172324|5.0|Blink is an amzing book to say the least.  Gladwell is able to take years of in-depth research and studies from diverse areas of psychology and sum them up into one umbrella idea. <br /> <br />As a recent psychology graduate who actually reads a few journals to keep current on studies it was amazing to find this book.  The wealth of science in Blink is \\"dumbed down\\" enough so that anyone can understand what each study was about; however, it still provides all the key information for the professional to find the study and do further research. <br /> <br />Overall the ideas presented in Blick are not etirely new.  The thing is they have never been put together in one place.  Everything you wanted to know about some of the most complex processes of the brain is put into a novel like thread that is easy for anyone to comprehend and put together but will leave even the ardent professional amazed at the systehsis of ideas. <br /> <br />A must read for anyone interested in the human mind!

0307277674|3.0|\\"How to Write Like Dan Brown\\"<br /><br />Chapter 1<br /><br />Bill was close, he knew it.  He walked away from the Starbucks counter with coffee in hand.<br /><br />Coffee, he thought.  He frowned.  What could it mean?  It would probably amuse the Starbucks owner that coffee was an anagram for \\"cof fee\\".  The first word, when translated from German, was pure gibberish because it wasn't German.  That might explain the consternation of the cashier's face when he tried to order in German.  \\"Fee,\\" of course, meant \\"cost.\\"<br /><br />And Bill certainly paid a lot for his latte.  Another anagram - latte:  \\"Late T\\".  Or \\"late tea\\", perhaps a mockery of a beverage preferred by obnoxious English people.  Maybe not as obnoxious as the French, however, who were certainly proud of their poodles and always asked visiting Americans about the quality of their poofy tails.<br /><br />Suddenly it struck him like lightning.  Could it be that simple?!?  He looked at the bottom of the cup and gasped in surprise.<br /><br />Chapter 2<br /><br />Susan ate a crumpet.  She began choking.<br /><br />Chapter 3<br /><br />Bill squealed in pain like the sacred feminine of pagan ancestors.  He had spilled his coffee on his front while trying to look at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />Chapter 4<br /><br />Susan managed to dislodge the crumpet from her mouth.  Boy, that guy spilling coffee on himself was really funny...<br /><br />Ok, enough joking.<br /><br />The story is fun to read, ignoring the rapid \\"chapter turning\\" approach to it all.  However, it's more simplistic than I hoped it would be.  It seems like a dying man with a stomach wound can certainly have enough time to scrawl hidden messages throughout the Louvre.  One would have thought there may have been blood around the Mona Lisa or Madonna of the Rocks, but we're led to believe that the French police are wholly inept.<br /><br />On another note, it appears that Opus Dei and the Vatican may be taking the book a little too seriously.  Some even have suggested boycotting the film.  IT'S FICTION, PEOPLE.  If you want to really get upset, let's film FACT - Spanish Inquisition anyone?  And what will this accomplish anyway?  By stirring up controversy, you're only asking rubbernecking people to stop on the highway and wonder what \\"caused the accident.\\"  Opus Dei will have inadvertently succeeded in advertising for the film.s film FACT - Spanish Inquisition anyone?

B000F8DB4O|5.0|This CD has to be the most satisfying of all his releases.  Not only does he satisfy the Metheny fan, he makes new fans out of those who enjoy hip grooves.  Take your pick on this CD.

B000EULJLU|5.0|This album, after many repeated, patient listens, should reveal itself to be an amazing work of art to any Tool fan.  It's even less immediately accessible at Lateralus, still the best rock album ever made in my opinion.  Tool has done exactly what I'd hoped:  grown sonically, while retaining their signature sound.  The A Perfect Circle influences are obvious and this is not a bad thing.  Each member of the band is experimenting in new ways.  Maynard mixes up his style of singing drastically throughout the album.  Adam and Justin are writing mind-bending riffs and Danny Carey, the world's most inventive, drummer, has once again managed to outdo himself by making his percussion the lead instrument in many passages.  I don't understand alot of the criticism for this album.  It's precisely the disc I wanted Tool to make.  Sure it's imperfect...I think it gets a bit slow at times and the interludes just don't do anything for me like on previous Tool albums.  That having been said, they have gone in a different direction and this is wonderful for the most creative group in heavy music.  Even more angular riffs, more ethereal passages, a more psychadelic sound, and new lyrical territory for Maynard.  10,000 Days is an incredible artistic statement from a band held to a higher standard by its fans and critics than any other.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is Red Hot Chili Peppers at their finest.  Seriously.  If you could compare this album to any of their others, the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik would probably come up.  But we're not here to compare are we?   <br /> <br />Again this is produced by Rick Rubin (who produced Blood Sugar Sex Magik) and many other great albums.  Although these guys produced 38 songs all together, they could only fit 28 of their finest on this 2-disk album.  The Peppers first single off of this album is already well known, and the music video is astounding when it comes to tributes to the rock n' roll world.  Yes, Dani California is a hit.  Was it the song in general that made the hit?  Yes, but the video added more spice to the mix.  DANI CALIFORNIA is a great song, but i do have to say this, \\"Dani California is not the greatest song on the album.\\"  So, my first suggestion to all of you buyers reading this review is this: If you love Dani, then get this album, because i can name at least ten other songs that are better then it.   <br /> <br />This album brings back the Peppers funky rythem that they kind of went away with starting with Californication.  \\"Hump De Bump\\" that is on Stadium Arcadium could possibly be the best song on the album just for its trippyness, hip style, smooth rythem, and the use of a trumpet.  It delivers with a kick, and gives loyal RHCP fans the satisfaction of the earlier music.  This song is very imaginative, and I can now say that only the best of the best in the way of funk can pull this song off.  The sound is amazing.  Wunderbar! <br /> <br />This album also can deliver some of RHCP's well known 'new style' slow songs, like Snow (Hey Oh), and She's Only 18.  This songs sound great, and listeners can really feel the lyrics flowing from anthony kiedis into them.  These songs feature amaing guitar riffs, jam sessions, and heart stopping solos' (the one you heard in Dani California was nothing compared to the rest of the album).   <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium is starting to bring out Anthony's words and mix and match them together so the listener can clearly understand what he's getting to.  This album stretches the lyrics out and glorifies everything in which Kiedis has to offer. <br /> <br />Probably the third best album from these guys falling short behind 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik', and 'Californiacation'.  Some may argue though, that this album exceeds Californiacation, and could challenge for the top spot.  A couple of songs that i picked that makes this album what it is are: Snow (Hey Oh), Tourture Me, Readymade, Especially in Michigan, and Hump De Bump.  I love how these songs really bring the album together.  When you hear Flea, and his bass kick in, you can't help but nod your head, or tap your feet to the beat, because its so amazing.  This album is pure Red Hot Chili Peppers funk.   <br /> <br />The Red Hot Chili Peppers have hit a note so high, that no other band today can hit (there may be a few exceptions...radiohead.....).  These guys put it out there, and you can obviously tell that Anthony's songwritting has improved.  They're a unique sound, and any hard core Red Hot Chili Peppers fan would enjoy this album.  Hell, even the RHCP poser fan would enjoy this, just because its good, and its new.  Figures.  But anyway, this album is a nessessity for any Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, or any rock fan in general that enjoys good riffs, solos, funk, and garage rock mixed into one.  If you have any Red Hot Chili Peppers album in your collection today, then get this album as soon as you can.  Seriously.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've had this album for 3 hours now. I've only been able to listen to it once, of course. I was hooked from the get-go and it only got better from there. \\"Dani California\\" starts slow but by the chorus you'll find yourself turning up the volume. Hardcore RHCP fans will not be disappointed. Infact, you might even say this is their best work by far.<br /><br />This album is not a joke...it's not experimental, nor is it a \\"last gas effort\\" as pre-reviewed on other nameless websites. Both discs are fantastic. \\"There's no skippers\\".<br /><br />In '99 I knew little of the Peppers, but over the last seven years and two albums (Californication & By The Way both of which are gems) I have grown to love this band. Not that I didn't like  them before.<br /><br />LISTEN! If you get anything out of this review get this:<br /><br />STADIUM ARCADIUM is a work of art that will keep you listening. I'm going to listen to it right now.<br /><br />If you're a fan of just \\"great music\\", pick up this stellar 2 CD set by rock's finest.
B00005JKN9|2.0|Saw this film on TV. Didn't care much for it. <br /> <br />Acting average. Costuming and scenery superb. Fight scenes splend especially the final one with Union Soldiers marching in to put down the draft riots. <br /> <br />Otherwise, this film was nothing but thugs wielding knives and naked whores. None of the characters were likable or even sympathetic. The only one close to likableness was Cutting. <br /> <br />The last scene of the movie pretty much matches my view of it in its entirety.
B000069HZP|4.0|The Game is an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br />Enjoyable isn't the same thing as \\"realistic.\\" <br /> <br />And it's not the same thing as \\"brilliant.\\" <br /> <br />But that doesn't take anything away from the fact that enjoyable movies are, well, enjoyable, and that's a good thing. <br /> <br />The Game follows a humorless business man, caught in the same kind of rut that had led his father before him to suicide, as he is ensnared in \\"The Game\\"--an intense, real-life psychological thriller that threatens to become \\"too real\\" at any moment. In the same way that Total Recall always kept alive the question of \\"what's really going on?\\", The Game keeps twisting and turning, refusing to show its cards until the very last scene. It's fun to watch, so long as you don't ask yourself too many questions, because the plot is quite unrealistic if you're the sort to care about that kind of thing. <br /> <br />The twisting and turning, the suspense, all of it is done well technically, but sometimes the story feels a little muted--a little \\"going through the motions.\\" The flashback sequences, meant to feel arty and unsettling, don't really contribute much and feel slightly pretentious. It's as though this movie was overly conscious of what it was trying to be, and what it was trying to do, and so it came out feeling manufactured and artificial. It is done well, but not brilliantly so. <br /> <br />So, The Game isn't realistic, and it's not brilliant, but if you have a few hours to spend, it will entertain you. \\"Entertaining\\"'s nothing to sneeze at--most movies don't get that far. A solid 3 3/4 stars, rounded up here to 4.
6305510016|3.0|I thought that this was an excellant film. <br /> <br />Beutiful scenes. Excellant acting by the supporting actresses and actors. Beutiful costuming. Great special effects.  <br /> <br />But it could have used a little work. Deleting all scenes with DiCaprio and what's her boobs would be my first recomendation. Would have improved the film greatly. I would also delete the class bigotry. The scenes of armed stewards shooting passengers have long since been disproven. Many rich men chose to go down with the Titanic so poor women ahd children could live. many men chose to die, shouting 'women and children first'. The first officer also deserves a little respect.  <br /> <br />Otherwise a great film. <br /> <br />A trival goof. Tommy Ryan wasn't a passenger. He was one of the crew. A steward.  Two other Ryans, Edward Ryan and Patrick Ryan were, both third class. None of them related.
B000683VI4|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies over the years and this is one of the very best.  Simply put, this is a beautifully told and very moving story that captures the essence of a lifetime of love and devotion.  Do not miss this film!<br /><br />The story begins and ends in a nursing home, but evolves through a series of flashbacks that occur when \\"Duke\\" (James Garner) reads a story from \\"The Notebook\\" to his companion (Gena Rowlands), who is suffering from dementia.  The flashbacks follow the story of Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and Allison Hamilton (Rachel McAdams), who meet at a carnival in Seabrook, South Carolina on June 6, 1940.  Noah is completely taken with Allie at first sight and doggedly pursues her until she gives in and goes out with him.  Over the summer the young people become very fond of each other, but Allie's parents (mostly her mother), who are well-to-do, have no desire for Allie to continue her relationship with Noah because he is a hometown boy who works in the lumberyard and has few prospects for ever becoming wealthy.  Thus, Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton (David Thornton, Joan Allen) break off the relationship by taking their daughter back to Charleston a few weeks early.  Although Noah writes a letter a day for the next year (365 in all), Mrs. Hamilton picks them off at the mailbox and Allie never sees them.  (For some strange reason, Allie never writes to Noah, maybe because he had hesitatingly broken off the relationship after witnessing the wrath of Allie's mother.)<br /><br />Noah, with the help of his father (Sam Shepard), who sells the family home while his son is away at war, acquires a local estate with lakefront property, but with a house built in the 18th century that needs extensive restoration.  Noah had made a promise to Allie that he would restore the house when he had taken her there to see the place.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Allie meets and falls in love with Lon Hammond Jr. (James Marsden) of Hammond Cotton, who she meets while doing voluntary nursing during the war.  They are about to be married when Allie happens to see a photograph of Noah in front of the restored house.  Memories then overwhelm her and she tells Lon that she must go back to Seabrook to wrap up a few things before the wedding.  Naturally, she shows up at Noah's house, where they reminisce, eat dinner in the room where promises were made 7 years before, and take a row boat ride out on the lake to visit the ducks and swans gathering there.  What follows is a wonderful scene where they get stuck in a downpour, discover that Noah's letters were purloined, and are swept up in the sweetness of earlier times.  During the few days that Allie remains at the house, there is a wonderful moment when Noah has gone out to buy breakfast and leaves Allie a note to follow arrows on the floor for a surprise, which turns out to be the only thing that Allie ever had time to do completely  on her own when she was young.  It is a precious moment when Allie walks into a room upstairs and discovers her surprise.<br /><br />Allie now has a very difficult decision to make, especially when Lon shows up in Seabrook.  The story of how the decision comes about and the relationship of the lovers to the nursing home occupants is the most moving part of the film.  This is a wonderful story that every viewer will certainly never forget.ry nursing during the war.

B000EOTAM6|4.0|I liked this movie a lot and, no doubt, Charlie Theron had a lot to do with that. But it was not just her. This movie was visually stimulating -- both the action and the scenery. It was fast paced, action packed, and had a plot, that although not completely new (what plot is?), or difficult to understand, it unraveled in such a way that kept you guessing most of the way through and then, put it together nicely.<br /><br />The one drawback, for me anyway, was the romantic connection between the leads. Although the romantic link, when made, was a strong one and pivotal to the plot, I did not feel that it was as convincing as it should have been. Unlike many reviewers, I think the movie should have been longer to explore more of the background of the characters and the resistance and, to find out how those fantastic women came by their extraordinary athletic powers.<br /><br />The movie makers did a good job of making a futuristic city. It was not full of flying cars or space ships -- simply a city in the future -- a type of \\"New World\\". (That's one of the things I liked about John Boorman's ZARDOZ.) Considering that the movie was shot in Berlin using buildings that were pre World War II (some over 150 years old) that was quite a feat and a nice touch.<br /><br />Some reviewers I've read thought some of the technology was too futuristic, perhaps beyond plausibility. But I would remind them of Arthur C. Clarke's third law: \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\"<br /><br />The movie had a satisfactory story, great visuals and action, and went by too fast.

0060934913|5.0|I read this book several years ago.  I found Bourdain's writing immensely entertaining.  His highly personal and amusing account of his experiences slaving in the food industry are a welcome relief from the ridiculously reverential foodie-centered writing that is so common.  I have given this book as gifts to friends who work in culinary fields and they have enjoyed it too.  A few weeks ago I bought a copy for my sister to read during a vacation trip.  She loved it too.    So I reread it.  It still made me laugh out loud.  So I am giving 5 stars to this immensely enjoyable book.
B0007P3582|1.0|G-Unot has become the new saying in the hip hop community, and snitching on fellow artists is the new bling bling, 50 has embodied everything that is not true hip hop is not. 50 has based his career on \\"beef\\" with lesser artists i.e. Ja Rule and murder inc. but when a more talented artist claps back like Shyne or Game 50 cannot fire back, and if he does it becomes a laughable track in which he says \\"G-Unit\\" 10 or more times. Like the reviewer above stated if you want some good NY hip hop get the new Ghostface Killah, or even get some Smif \\"N\\" Wessun, dont fall for this Corporate hip hop created for suburban white kids.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Cee-Lo and Danger Mouse's album is an album that I have been looking forward to for a while, and it was definitely worth the wait. While it is not the style that I expected, it is every bit as good in quality as I could have hoped for. I have been a fan of Cee-Lo's entire career, from his days as a street poet in the Goodie Mob to his soulful solo albums, and I have thoroughly enjoyed Danger Mouse's production on the Danger Doom collaboration with MF Doom and his other works with Gorillaz. In a collaboration between the two, I expected solid and original hip hop production and Cee-Lo's signature fusion of rap and soul. As soon as I popped \\"St. Elsewhere\\" into the player, I was blown away. No song is ever worth skipping, and the production fits the singing perfectly. It is hard to nail a genre to Gnarls Barkley. Cee-Lo's happy and silly singing is close to soul spanning over many generations, and Danger Mouse's intricate and many layered beats are reminiscent of soul, funk, jazz, rap, and rock at various times. He serves as an entire band for the singer. Cee-Lo fans expecting his street-conscious rap lyrics of the past will not find them here, but will instead be fulfilled with very funny, soulful, deep, and great lyrics sung in his high yet raspy voice. \\"St. Elsewhere\\" is an album that will appeal to many different types of listeners, and I'm sure both Cee-Lo and Danger Mouse will increase their audience here. Both of their huge efforts are evident. \\"St. Elsewhere\\" is also great because every song is the right length, averaging two and a half minutes, so that nothing is too much, yet every idea is explored sufficiently. It is the first album of its kind and really shines.<br /><br />The album opens with the beautiful trumpet line on \\"Go Go Gadget Gospel\\", a spinning, joyful song that Cee-Lo puts everything he has into. \\"Crazy\\", the album's single, has flutes, violins, and drumkits in the instrumental, and Cee-Lo's heartfelt verses about love and relationships are worth your ear over and over again. \\"St. Elsewhere\\" has a wonderful slow trumpet line, sad and encouraging lyrics, and is great overall. My favorite track is \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\", a very catchy rock song. The electric guitar and drum instrumentals keep my head bobbing, and the bullhorned verses complement it well. \\"Smiley Faces\\" is a very reminiscent track with excellent background voices and music and lyrics that keep you listening. \\"Boogie Monster\\" is a completely fun and silly track, with creepy music but hilarious lyrics with a twist ending. \\"Feng Shui\\"'s silly and random lyrics fit Danger Mouse's blissful yet simple production. \\"Just A Thought\\" is the deepest track lyrically, where Cee-Lo admits \\"I've tried everything but suicide...but it's crossed my mind.\\" The drum and guitar paint as gloomy a picture as the lyrics do. \\"Transformer\\" has organ and horns, and a chorus that you'll try to sing along to and find yourself unable. \\"Who Cares\\" sounds like a song by the Beatles, seriously. \\"On-Line\\" has whispery, seductive singing and a soulful back. \\"Necromancing\\" begins with the Marvin Gaye-styled introduction (\\"Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up\\") and turns into a story of sexual indulgence. The album ends strong with \\"Storm Coming\\", a cool bluesy track, and \\"The Last Time\\", with a beautiful chorus and beat.<br /><br />\\"St. Elsewhere\\" bends the music landscape and creates something like we've never been exposed to before. It takes experimental to the next level (think Andre 3000's \\"The Love Below\\" to the tenth power), yet is not too indulgent either, leaving the listener completely satisfied at all times. Anyone would love this, you could play it for the kids in the car, and I'm planning on giving copies to my rock-loving father, jazz and blues-loving grandfather, and R&B-loving sister.

I think all of the original artists would be pleased with the job he has done!!!! My absolute favorite song on this album is one Michael wrote himself....Home.  I can play that song over and over. I also enjoy his versions of Save the Last Dance and Can't Buy Me Love.  My wife usually does not like this style of music, but she likes Michael.  Go buy this album if you haven't already....You will not be disappointed!!!
B00030590I|4.0|\\"Hero\\" is a beautiful movie, as all Zhang Yimou movies are.  There are spectacular outdoor, epic-like scenes, and wondrously colorful costumes and fabrics (and swords!) in addition to the choreographed sword play.  I would also note that this movie was his most successful American box office flick--and therein lies a problem.<br /><br />Zhang Yimou is a great artist.  He uses the silver screen the way a Michelangelo or Rembrandt uses a canvas.  His sense of color and line and composition would cause Da Vinci or Picasso or any of the great Renaissance masters to sit up and take notice were they around today.  His films are universally admired not only for their visual artistry but--and this is where I take exception to the direction in which that this film suggests that Zhang Yimou is going--their story-telling ability and their unusual sensitivity to the human condition.  Here we have a fantasy of Chinese history brought to life.  We have supernatural swordplay--beautifully, hauntingly done, to be sure: sword play as ballet--but what we don't have is a real human story.<br /><br />This is more like a legend.  The great King of Qin, threatened by three great warriors--Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow--is now threatened by a third, the Nameless one (like somebody out of a Clint Eastwood movie), who has pretended to vanquish the other three as a means to get within ten paces of the hated King in order to slay him.  This is history as seen from the point of view of Great Men, not history as the force of events and conditions greater than any single person.  This is also history as myth.  It is nationalistic: the great Chinese king unites \\"our land\\" in a great historical event in which the Chinese people can take pride.<br /><br />It also glorifies war.  The great gray mass of soldiers in the service of the king (Zhang Yimou actually used something like 18,000 soldiers from the Revolutionary Army of the People's Republic of China in the production) represents a force that will go on to triumph over lesser forces.  The King of Qin can be seen as the ultimate warlord, the warlord with the largest army and therefore the one who will win.<br /><br />Yet, there is a sense in which this does not sit well with Zhang Yimou.  He likes the individual heroes, and indeed would have Nameless achieve his personal victory except that Nameless sees in the end that killing the king would not be a victory at all.  Furthermore, Zhang Yimou celebrates in the choreographed sword dances of his heroes the indomitable human spirit that will in the long run, triumph over the forces of sheer might.  We can see this in not only the beauty of the dances, but in the association of calligraphy--that uniquely human art form--with the play of the sword.  He who practices calligraphy with his heart and soul also learns the secrets of the sword.<br /><br />My problem with all this is that just prior to seeing this film I viewed Hotel Rwanda (2004) in which ironically the horrendous human slaughter in Rwanda was achieved in large part through the use of machetes made in China.  Can we celebrate the sword about which it is said: if you live by the sword you will die by the sword?  These are words that have only a tiny impact to us compared to what they meant to the people of 2,000 years ago who actually knew what it meant to die by the sword.  Or should we more correctly celebrate the word, not the sword?  For it is also said that the word is mightier than the sword.<br /><br />I think Zhang Yimou knows this, and I suspect part of what he wanted to convey in this film is that sort of message.  However, I think his love of beauty and his sense of what works cinematically overcame what he might have intended, and instead of a great film we have one that is merely beautiful.<br /><br />But by all means see this.  See this for his artistry of course.  See this to compare it to the legendary kung fu movies.  See this for Jet Li who plays Nameless and is a great favoriteof the Chinese cinema, and for Daoming Chen who plays the king.  And see this for the beautiful actresses Maggie Cheung, who plays Flying Snow, and Ziyi Zhang, who plays Moon.  And last but not least, see this for Tony Leung Chiu Wai who plays the enigmatic Broken Sword.great favorite of the Chinese cinema, and for Daoming Chen who plays the king.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|If you just focus on the guitar only and listen to the fire and emotion that John Frusciante plays with on this album, then this 2 CD set is worth the price alone.  I have read the Guitar World interview with John Frusciante, and he really poured a lot of his soul into this album more than any other Chili Peppers recording.  In my opinion, it shows!  The guitar work on this album will go down in history as Frusciante's best.<br /><br />I got deja vu after buying this as I was driving around in the rain listening to it in the car...when I bought Blood Sugar Sex Magic it was raining too.  I cut out of class in high school that day just to get it earlier than all my friends.
B00005TT77|5.0|It will always be incredibly challenging to match the artistic talent that The Beatles possessed. Nevertheless, this set of songs by the artists on this CD is as good as it gets to achieving a proper, respectful tribute to The Beatles with thoughtful and passionate cover songs.<br /><br />The CD has a whopping 17 tracks for almost an hour of music from the movie (or inspired by the movie) I Am Sam. The music was beautifully woven into the movie; but even with just this CD you'll be blown away! It's a must-have for fans of The Beatles, the artists here, and fans of great rock everywhere.<br /><br />The CD starts off strong with a rendition of \\"Two Of Us\\" by Aimee Mann and Michael Penn. I think their personal relationship helped make them harmonize so well for this song.  The Black Crowes do an excellent job with the musical arrangement for \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds;\\" the drums are first-class! Sheryl Crow injects a great country music accent to \\"Mother Nature's Son.\\" Sarah McLachlan performs a very sensitive rendition of \\"Blackbird;\\" and the CD ends beautifully with one of my very favorite Beatles songs, \\"Let It Be\\" performed by Nick Cave with Chaz Jankel on piano. Awesome!<br /><br />Amazon writes that some of the \\"reinterpretations (on this album)...are riskier.\\" I don't agree. While risks were taken, you won't know it! For example, Grandaddy does a great job of adding their own spice to \\"Revolution\\" and Paul Westerberg's voice was rather pleasing to my ear on \\"Nowhere Man.\\"<br /><br />The quality of the sound is excellent; and all of the musical arrangements are very thoughtfully produced. The liner notes come with a few color pictures from the motion picture I Am Sam; and you also get the song credits.<br /><br />Overall, this CD is the product of an exceptionally talented group of artists who perform a noticeably sensitive suite of covers of great Beatles songs. This album will touch a nerve in you and leave you wondering why they couldn't have recorded even more. The singers expressed even the finest of nuances in the meanings of every word in every song; and I treasure this album as one of my preferred CDs. If this were a vinyl album I would have worn the grooves off of it long ago.e recorded even more.

0142001104|5.0|In addition to all the other fine features of this book, I want to point one out that might escape notice: this is a wonderful 'how to do it' manual for teachers. Rosamund & Ben explain fundamental principles that should help anyone in a position to instruct others, at all levels. As a university instructor, this book helped me understand the critical importance of framing course work as a cooperative venture, with students encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning. Principles such as \\"it's all invented\\" and \\"give yourself an A\\" fit beautifully into the principles of active learning.<br /><br />If you an instructor responsible for helping others learn how to teach, I strongly recommend this book.

B000EULJLU|4.0|Dissonant and fragile, it is an album not for everyone.  Indeed, only two or three songs are worthy of radio air time (don't just call me pessimist, try and read between the lines).  It'd be impossible to represent the album here, one would have to listen to it.  It does, however, have nearly as much slow and melodic as it does hard rock, but very little which should simply be called \\"filler\\"!  10,000 days has a sound that takes fairly eccentric taste to enjoy.  On the whole, it is unlike previous Tool albums, and thus may leave a Tool fan devastated or refreshed.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|'I Write Sins Not Tragedies' was only the taste of the medicine you get when you pop in your new Panic! At the Disco album...After you explore the cd for a bit, you will soon realize that you can no longer be hardcore because of the simple fact that your ears have fallen deeply in love with the sound of what Fall Out Boy wants to be.  Call it Bubble Gum Pop Rock, call it Techno/Emo, call it whatever the hell you want, but PATD locks you in and does not realease you until you beg for mercy and escape.  The piano, the synth, and the catchy (yet remarkable)lyrics are everything you have ever wanted to say if you were ever to be your own band.  As catchy as the album is it says what you think and you know it!  Seriously, PATD has done a wonderful job in a debut and I am sure that if given the chance, their hype will be lived up to in a second album.  Also, watch out for that 'Time to Dance'...you will swear it is your new drug when you get hooked to it.  Take a few listens.

Just JUPITER(disc1)is the best chilli peppers cd ive heard. both discs are good but MARS(disc2) was not as good as the first, the first every song was great. the second had some i didnt like but great ones in there also. Favorite tracks-<br /><br />JUPITER-snow(hey oh),slow cheetah, torture me. MARS- tell me baby,21st century, death of a martian.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|With perfectly balanced song writing, beautiful melodies and a surprisingly rockin' ending, this CD leaves you asking for more from this band. I was very skeptical after hearing \\"By The Way\\" which seemed to be a seriously lack-luster album. But, this one proved to be another defining CD in the career of the Chili Peppers.<br /><br />Highlights on this Album:<br /><br />Snow (Hey Yo)<br /><br />Hump de Bump<br /><br />Tell Me Baby<br /><br />Hard to Concentrate<br /><br />Storm in a Teacup<br /><br />Death of a Martian<br /><br />The album is absolutely stunning all the way around. The songs fit together so perfectly that it is almost hard to resist this album's charm.

Fall out Boy is absolutely terrible now. This band combines dance with emo, which makes it very original. this is not mainstream. If you are considering buying this, do it.<br /><br />Don't listen t anything that Kommisar Vassily Zaitsev \\"Socialist Metal Head\\" ever says. He knows absolutely nothing about me, emo, or even metal.<br /><br />Also, Slayer is terrible. it is just noise. read my reviews about them. support real musicians<br /><br />And also, Dave who reviewed the Slayer album...just no. I am hot. You admit your ugly.

B0000CDL93|5.0|I hate Oliver Stone and sometimes it's for odd reasons. Like this movie. This is a great movie, I loved it. But it makes me hate Stone nonetheless. A few months ago there was a special on the History Channel about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In it, they used a computer to determine just who killed Kennedy. After watching that program I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin, the guy had actually spoke with people about how he wanted to feel important and the only way to do that was to kill a National Leader. This guy was an attention seeker. Reading a little bit into Jim Garrison, I found people who have stated that Garrison was a cruel man who bribed, drugged, and threatened people in order to get them to admit there was a conspiracy to kill JFK. This movie makes Garrison into a good guy and presents a lot of interesting theories about Kennedy's death. Theories that I haven't heard in anything else as being untrue, so I'm left to completely reverse my thinking on who killed Kennedy. But, anyway, I'll start talking about the movie. Kevin Costner, in an Oscar worthy performance, plays Jim Garrison. Garrison is a D.A. in New Orleans, who like all Americans, was shocked the day JFK was assassinated. Garrison watches the story unfold on television. Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman, who's performance is massively underrated. He should've got an Oscar nomination) <br />is captured and then killed by a man named Jack Ruby, who was rumored to have connections with the mob. While the rest of America accepts this as what has happened, Garrison sees something wrong and launches an investigation into the death of JFK. Throughout his search, he meets people like David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon), and X (Donald Sutherland) who all agree that there was a conspiracy and that a man named Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) was in on it. I don't want to give away the ending, but you probably know what happened with the Shaw case. Anyway, <br />mostof the people Garrison and his team interview wind up dead or backing out of what they said...Which ends up making this film all the more interesting. I do want to warn anyone who watches this movie to not accept all of this as fact. I don't know how much of this is true, although everything is pretty damn elaborate; but Oliver Stone has always had a reputation for \\"creative licenseing\\". Look at movies like Nixon, The Doors, & Alexander to see that. Nixon suggested that Richard Nixon knew something about the assassination of JFK. The Doors suggested that Jim Morrison was a blabbering idiot with an indian frequently coming in and out of his body. Oh, and then Alexader suggests that Alexander the Great was a homosexual who did not die in battle but at a later date. Stuff like that makes it hard for me to accept anything in this film. But the entertainment value here is enough to suggest watching it. It's truly a good movie that should not be passed up. <br />All the performances are great, the writing is great, and even the directing is great; Even though Stone still weaves in and out of black & white to color. <br />But, as I said, I think people should see this movie but don't make your decision on what really happened that day based solely on the film. <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />
B00005JL78|5.0|Ok, so since everyone and their grandma has seen this movie, and I haven't my boyfriend made me watch it; once more he gets a plus and everyone who likes it is correct for I can now see what all the hoopla is about. Since this has over six hundred review and since it seems than everyone has seen it I won't repeat the plot too much. <br /> <br />The movie starts with a bag; a crime is about to be committed and its being foreseen by three \\"Pre-Cogs,\\" psychic beings ( human) whose visions of murders have never been wrong and who work with the forces that keep murders down to zero. Well Tom Cruise (I'm not a fan either but he's great in this one, I give credit where it's due) ends up seeing himself committing a crime. Since the system has been flawless we know something is up, since he is a good, kind guy and he is not a murderer. His work place is crawling with private investigators who want a closer look, but who seem like they want him to fail.  <br /> <br />What I really enjoyed was the suspense, and the mapping of the puzzle; the answer of what the future will really be like for Chief John Anderton (Cruise) and the bad guys are there but you really have no idea who they really are. <br /> <br />There is a lot of futurist cars, police arrests, flying vehicles, insanely modern prison and a huge mystery surrounding the beginning of Pre-Crime which seems to put whoever gets close to revealing its truth in a death set up like the one John is in.  <br /> <br />As Anderson is on the run, he goes through incredible lengths to disguise himself in order not to her arrested he must go below the radar of the state-of-the-art automated city, where every step you take is monitored(eye transplant, facial muscle change, tricks and gimmicks) I found myself biting my lips when he came close to some bad ends. <br /> <br />This is definitely a futuristic type of a movie with tons of action, good fighting, great chases, jumping of buildings, going back in the past and getting some sweet revenge. Yes Minority Report is all that you think it will be, and maybe even more....
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack's third album gave us a new Godsmack. They had a new (and much better) drummer named Shannon Larkin and a different sound. They were still good ol' <br />angry Godsmack with crunching guitars, great basslines, and quick wristed fast drumming. Sully Erna's lyrics still stank of anger and pain, but they also had some slower melodic songs like \\"Serenity\\" which sounds like the song \\"Voodoo\\" off their first album but is way better. The album is a masterpiece of rock, every song is a five star song except \\"I Am\\" which is just a little weaker than the other songs. But here's the track list: <br /> <br />1. Straight Out of Line <br />2. Faceless <br />3. Changes <br />4. Make Me Believe <br />5. I Stand Alone <br />6. Re-Align <br />7. I F**king Hate You <br />8. Releasing the Demons <br />9. Dead & Broken <br />10. I Am <br />11. The Awakening <br />12. Serenity <br /> <br />The album opens with \\"Straight Out of Line\\" which is awesome and has a great music video too if you ever get to check that out. \\"Faceless\\" features a pretty angry Sully Erna. \\"Changes\\" is less angry and shows how diverse Godsmack can be. \\"Make Me Believe\\" has cool lyrics and is one of the best songs on the album. \\"I Stand Alone\\" is on the radio a lot, but is cool. \\"Re-Align\\" is another song you hear on the radio a lot, but is much better when played loud. \\"I F**king Hate You\\" has some smart lyricism. <br />\\"Releasing the Demons\\" is the 2nd best song on the album, in my opinion. \\"Dead & Broken\\" is another Godsmack classic. \\"I Am\\" is good, but it's the weakest song on the album. \\"The Awakening\\" is a weird & quick drum solo. The album closes with my favorite song on the album \\"Serenity\\" which is very much like \\"Voodoo\\" but a lot better.  <br /> <br />GRADE: A- <br />
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I was really surprised how much I loved this movie! Not to ruin it for the fans, but I'm not even a fan of Gwyneth, Jude and Angelina yet I absolutely adored this fantasy tale that was  beyond my expectations as they were all superb in it. <br /> <br />Sure I saw the trailer in theatres back in 2004 and it did cross my mind to see it one day and I can't say how glad I am that I did. This was a real adventure with this incredibly foggy and drawn on atmosphere of old 1930 with the curled hair, perfect makeup, crisp clothes, old fashioned automobiles, antique radios - it was full of the air of that era. At the same time the robots that attacked New York were beyond modern in science, it's surely nothing a man can see even in this day marching past his block as he's having his bagel and coffee in the morning reading the paper. <br /> <br />What was really extraordinary was the suspenseful tale of mystery; why did the giant robot attack happen and what was the reason for all the great scientist disappearing? It's obvious that they are being taken away by a scientist who was grand enough to build the nemesis who turned on them but why he needed them was another thing. <br /> <br />I was stunned, amazed and my interest was a 100% into the move as Sky Captain and Polly Perkins (Jude and Gwyneth) who had a personal conflict of the hearts in the past cross paths again while seeking help of Frankie Cook (Jolie) who plays a sexy amphibious squadron pilot capable of flying, diving into the water with her plain, averting monsters and doing incredible heroic stunts in order to get them to their goal; the missing mad scientist held responsible for the mayhem. This movie had some insanely amazing sequences under water, in the air, at battle and surprise wise. I was entertained the entire time and I was kind of mad at myself for not seeing it in the theatres the second it came out. <br /> <br />Other than the picturesque visuals I loved the love triangle between the ladies and Sky Captain, their courage for finding out the secret and all the little smart talk going on. I was laughing at the witty conversation a number of times and that really made me love this movie.  Its fast, smart, fun, you don't look at the time when its over and you will be wowed when its over, or at least I was and I will warmly recommend it to anyone with a bit of spare time and a comfy seat to enjoy and dive into this crazy adventure.
076790592X|5.0|I thought that Tuesdays with Morrie was an amazing book. Once I started reading it it was hard to put it down.  The advice that Morrie gave and the way that Mitch wrote about him portrayed him as an amazing man. By the end of the book I felt like I had been taught by Morrie and that I had learned all of the lessons that Mitch had.
B000001I0K|4.0|This music is slimey, grungy and slow. A mix of all the different styles I like in music. Cramps are what got me into Psychobilly. Though it is slower than most of their other music its not bad slow its the good slow. The creepy crawly horror where you know the monster is around the corner and you wait in breathless anticipation until the thing pounces. That feeling of anticipation is like what you get listening to this album. Most of them are covers like Ronnie Cook's slopper \\"The Goo Goo Muck\\", the garage classic by Randy Alvey \\"The Green Fuz\\", they do great justice to the genius masterpiece by the Novas \\"The Crusher\\" and the Trashmen's great \\"Sufrin' Bird\\" among others. There is originals on this album it is great sludgy music I'd expect nothing less from the psychobilly masters
B00005JOYA|5.0|All I have to say is wow. Fans of the game should not be disapointed. This movie payed good respect to the game. For the most part it followed the first game well. There are some different elements but it doesn't to me make much of a difference. Even if you have never played or heard of the game Silent Hill I think you will love this movie. This movie is very freaky and morbid in a lot of ways. There is some very disturbing stuff in this film. One thing I liked a lot about this movie was the over all look of the film. It mached the game perfectly. Also the creatures were just as I remembered them from the game sick and twisted.But what I liked most about the movie was how it used the same music that was in the game.  But I think fans and non fans of the game will enjoy this movie.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Alright so I waited a little bit before I reviewed this one to let it grow on me. I have have been a fan since undertow, and love opiate, but here's what I've noticed through the years of waiting, every album seems to have less songs and more fillers. Meaning nothing but junk and noise in between a 'real' song. I love the 4 or 5 songs on this album, but the 5 out of 11 tracks isn't good enough for a fan and when they make us wait 4 or 5 years to get the next album, it's just almost not worth it. It hurts saying anything negative, but when it's true....I don't want an album full of filler noise and instrumental tracks with weird talking in it, I want hard hitting 11 tracks of full band with vocals from maynard like they had in undertow, sure the last track on undertow was a little long with dialog and useless noise, but it was tastfully done with the \\"tool\\" feel of weirdness and dark side. I was just hoping for more. We wait and we wait, and we get 5 songs in five years, with no dualdisc options with 5.1 suround sound, or videos. NOTHING but 5 songs and a cool case. NOT WORTH IT. Go download the five songs on this disc and save your money.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I was very happy with 10,000 Days I thought it was awesome. Although they did not come out rocking as hard as they did in Lateralus, I think they rocked just hard enough. Many people are saying things like Great Album but not for Tool. I challenge you to write a better album for them. I will say their sound was kinda Pink Floydie, it seemed mystical and much more trippy then albums past, however it was very much Tool and it rocked. I'm excited for their next album. Hopefully we don't have to wait 5 more years for them to put it out.
0439227585|4.0|This book to me was a mysteries book for the reason that all the drama that started going on from the beginning of the book. First it starts with the Baudelaire children went for a walk in the beach when they found out that there house had burned down and there parents had been in it and their had died in the enormous fire. Soon they found them self's traveling from house to house until they found them self's in Count Olaf someone that there parent had never mentioned to them. They thought that they were in a fun place but soon they found out that he just wanted them so that he could get there fortune. But the oldest, Violet wasn't going to let that happen. So because of her effort in doing that Count Olaf threatens to throw sunny off a tower so that he could get the money. After all that commotion Count Olaf was arrested and thrown in Gail.
B00003CWPL|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the most amazing movies ever created. The first time you watch this I suggest that you dont try any make any sense of it and just go with it. Its visually amazing and its the expierence you have while watching this that will get you to either love it or hate it. There is alot of symbolisim in alot of scenes, but the film plays out as more of a bizzare nightmare than anything and there is no true meaning. It is escapist entertainment but so much more, David Lynch created something really unique with Eraserhead. Its not really a horror movie but you will see some extremely wierd and disturbing images and even dialogue. All in all one of the most strange but beautiful films ive ever seen, and I think everbody should see it atleast once.
B000EULJLU|5.0|i will admit when i heard tool's single for \\"Vicarious,\\" i was a little disheartened by how it sounded like the \\"Latterallus\\" album. however, when you spend time listening to the album, you hear something new each time you listen to a track you didn't hear before. everyone in the band really stepped up once again to create a great album that to me is their heaviest album yet. yes, you can hear similarities from \\"Latterallus\\" and \\"AEnema,\\" but it's more of taking what made those albums great and augmenting them to make them better. this is a must buy album for any tool fan.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|On the good side:<br /><br />1. The band has not rocked like this for a long time. There are plenty of rockers here fir those who got tired of their later stuff.<br /><br />2. The album is well balanced between the slower and the more upbeat songs. Particularly the second half of the album is not a let down.<br /><br />3. There are instant songs with catchy hooks.<br /><br />4. Pearl Jam have left out experimental filler and just focused on songs.<br /><br />On the bad side:<br /><br />1. Eddie has definitely lost his voice. He has difficulty reaching the notes, and he struggles when he is screaming<br /><br />2. The band sound at times like an average garage band copying Pearl Jam, not Pearl Jam themselves.<br /><br />3. The band has lost some of its creativity. So much so, that they seem to be ripping off AC/DC riffs (\\"Life wasted\\" \\"Comatose\\"). The rock songs are good but don't vary that much. Compare \\"Severed Hand\\" \\"World Wide Suicide\\" and \\"Big wave\\". Similar chord structures.<br /><br />4. The production is not very good. It sounds saturated, not clean. There is not enough and the guitars take over the other instruments way too much. Basically, it sounds like a band rehearsing in a garage.<br /><br />6. There is a feeling of pretentiousness in the air. You can feel it in songs like \\"marker in the sand\\" where Eddie sells his cheap philosophy, and the ultimately clicheed \\"world wide suicide\\"...as if we didn't know already...To top it all, the supposedly mindblowing concept of a mysterious avocado....I mean come on.<br /><br />Final comment:<br /><br />This is not a return to form, as I have read in other reviews. Go and compare this to Vs and Ten. There is no comparison in my opinion. The only reason why people seem to be saying this is because there is a lot more rock, but that is all. If you have followed the evolution of Pearl Jam, you will find that there are parts of this album which resemble \\"Yield\\"(\\"gone\\", \\"parachutes\\")  \\"Riot Act\\" (\\"marker in the sand\\", \\"unemployable\\", \\"come back\\") and \\"Binaural\\" (\\"army reserve\\").
B000E1YVZU|4.0|Almost 10 years ago, a Broadway musical named \\"Rent\\" opened and quickly spawned a devoted legion of fans known as \\"Rent-heads.\\"  A film version of the show was inevitable but took almost a decade to reach the big screen.  Was it worth the wait?  Well, yes and no.<br /><br />First, the good news: the overall spirit of the stage show, which I'll admit I've seen nine times, is intact.  The music is still excellent, and six of the eight original Broadway cast members reprise their portrayals for the big screen (and the two new additions are surprisingly strong as well).  If you've never seen the show (and most people haven't), you should still enjoy the film if you're a fan of musicals, rock music, and/or the independent spirit of broke twentysomethings.  If you can't stand movies where the characters frequently and spontaneously break into song, avoid this film (though these songs are much closer to today's rock music than most musicals you'll see).<br /><br />Now, the disappointing news: while the spirit remains the same and the cast is strong, director Chris Columbus (who directed the first two--and blandest--\\"Harry Potter\\" films) has made enough needless changes to the source material that the overall film will likely leave a frustrated taste in any hardcore Rent-head's mouth.  Some of the changes are good (having \\"Santa Fe\\" sung on a subway car works very well, and even the risky move of setting \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\" in a country club pays off), but Columbus tries too hard to please mass audiences by using flashier locations (Roger now sings \\"What You Own\\" in the middle of the New Mexico desert, making the number seem like a Calvin Klein ad) and replacing some of the musical's sung lyrics with spoken dialogue (which has a negatively comic effect for anyone already familiar with the show's music; imagine hearing Dorothy speak the lyrics to \\"Over the Rainbow\\" in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\").<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not you've seen \\"Rent\\" on stage, you should see the film if you're a fan of the musical genre.  It is a good film.  But the show is better.<br /><br />A note about the DVD:<br /><br />The bonus disc contains a great documentary called \\"No Day But Today,\\" which details \\"Rent\\" creator Jonathan Larson's life and the eventual genesis of \\"Rent.\\"  The documentary is excellent, especially considering it's a special feature on a DVD.  It stands well enough on its own that any fan of the show will love it whether or not they liked the film.<br /><br />The bonus disc also includes alternate/deleted scenes and songs including \\"Goodbye, Love,\\" \\"Halloween,\\" and an alternate ending that is far superior to the one they ended up using and closer to the ending of the stage show.  (Chris Columbus's commentary track on the alternate ending reveals his uncertainty with using the ending they did use, and he was right to be uncertain; he should have gone with his gut and kept this one.)
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Being that i have been a fan since 1986, and after hearing their last album i was a little skeptical. (\\"By the Way\\" made me cringe). First off, there are way too many mellow tracks on Stadium. There is some tasteful work on these two dics, but when they kick in to a funk jam you start to really dig the vibe, they drop off with continuous mellow songs. if they would have dropped a few of the mellow fillers and added a couple dirty funk jams this album would be their best work since Blood Sugar. i was listening itching for consistancy. this definetly a mature sound for them. they have hit new heights as song writers and a band. But the band 15 years ago seemed a lot more fun. i have to mention, john's guitar playing shines like  no other RHCP record. he rips some great solos and has never quite opened up like he does here. When you hear the 6 minute song, \\"Turn it again\\", you'll wish that they just jammed out more of them. For all the old school RHCP fans, you're never gonna get a BSSM  again. they've come to far as a band now. And plus, their in their 40s.
0783239955|5.0|One of the funniest films of the 1990's was a French comedy called \\"The Dinner Game.\\"  I saw the 1998 film out of boredom, and it was a wonderful surprise, instantly becoming one of my favorite movies.<br /><br />The simple plot concerns a man, Pierre, who attends a mean-spirited \\"idiot dinner\\" every week where each regular attendee must bring the stupidest person they can find.  Pierre strikes gold when he meets Fran?ois, who reconstructs famous architecture out of matchsticks.  However, before they can get to the dinner, Pierre throws his back out, and every effort Fran?ois (who doesn't know the real reason he was invited to dinner) makes to help Pierre backfires drastically and hilariously.<br /><br />What could be a hard-to-watch film about people's cruelty to each other instead becomes a delicious comedy of errors as, in the course of one evening, the endearing Fran?ois keeps bungling various aspects of Pierre's life such as his marriage, finances, friendships, and involvement with a nymphomaniac.<br /><br />Even if you don't like foreign films, give \\"The Dinner Game\\" a chance.
B0000636UN|3.0|Sheryl Crow's fourth release, C'mon, C'mon is a disapponintment after the best album in my opinion to date, The Globe Sessions. There is a only handful of tracks that are good, and those songs include:Steve McQueen, You're an Original, Safe and Sound, Hole in my Pocket, and the haunting closer, The Weather Channel. The rest of the tracks are mediocre and too poppy for my taste. There's guests apparances by Stevie Nicks, Lenny Kravitz, and even Gywneth Paltrow who sings background vocals on It's only Love. It's not her best or that creative, it's a little too happy and not a well-rounded array of songs, I recommend her prevoius albums before this one. C'mon, C'mon is anything but spectacular.
0307277674|2.0|\\"Many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.\\"<br /><br />-Leonardo Da Vinci<br /><br />Dan Brown prints this Da Vinci quote halfway through this surprisingly bad book.  Although it supposedly refers to the Bible, the beautiful irony is that it describes The Da Vinci Code perfectly.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say Brown was trying to be cute here.<br /><br />But the book is so poorly written that it's impossible to believe Brown is capable of something as stylistically sophisticated as self-parody.  If I could only have a 10-Euro Vatican Bearer Bond for every time \\"Sophie's jaw dropped\\", or \\"Langdon smiled\\", or someone had a revelation in italics!  I'd be half as rich as Dan Brown.<br /><br />Much of the Code reads like a bad screenplay.  The characters are flat and unbelievable.  A Harvard Symbology professor and a Cryptology expert stumped by one-star difficulty GAMES Magazine puzzles?  The descriptions are limited to the physical, and every action and behavior is completely spelled out for the reader in triplicate.  Nothing is left to the imagination.<br /><br />The story is actually pretty compelling, but the execution is so damn terrible that it's uninspiring.  12 hours spread out into 450+ pages and nearly 100 chapters is not exactly fast-paced.  Compared with something like The Bourne Identity, it's slow and tired.  Furthermore, the mythology lacks any sort of depth.  Most of it reads like a kindergarden teacher explaining the alphabet to 5-year olds.<br /><br />If there's one redeeming feature of The Code, it's that it has served as inspiration for non-readers to take a break from bad TV, movies and video games to favor bad books instead.  In my mind, that's progress.  Seriously.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Grease is the coolest musical I have ever seen. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were the \\"thing\\" back in the 1970s. Grease has great songs, fabulous choreography, and solid acting. My favorite songs are Summer Nights, Hopelessy Devoted to you, and You're the one that I want. I seen this movie about a million times, never gets old and boring. Defintely get this movie on widescreen, looks better. If you enjoy a musical here and there, make sure you add Grease to your retro-cool collection, Grease is the word!
B00006AW2P|4.0|This is one helluva debut! It is catchy, fresh, imaginative, and indicative of their myriad influences.<br /><br />Keith gives us plenty of two-string riffs, Mick shows his range, Brian shows his versatility, and the rhythm section sounds tight. Some of the stuff is a bit of a stretch (\\"Can I Get A Witness\\"), but let's face it - we could say that about every recording this band has ever released, right?<br /><br />The stand-outs are pure joy; \\"I'm A King Bee,\\" \\"Carol,\\" \\"Not Fade Away,\\" \\"Route 66,\\" \\"Tell Me,\\" \\"Little by Little,\\" and the blues instrumental \\"Now I've Got A Witness,\\" the latter two showcasing Keith's nascent interpretations of the work of his blues/rock guitar influences.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album that serves as a splendid launching point for this remarkable band and a wonderful introduction for anyone interested in exploring their deep, solid roots.
B00005NWM3|1.0|People that say that this album is dark really doesn't know what they are talking about.  I do not hate or feel contempt for any of the people that like this band or album.  They obviously just aren't that exposed to much music.  There was a time once when I thought Papa Roach was all that, then my friend gave me about 20 cd's full of Pantera, Korn, Mudvayne, A Perfect Circle, and Tool, and I realized how talentless and immature Papa Roach was.  The people who like or listen to this album just need to do the same.  Its all right guys, you can do it, spread your wings and leave this immature crap behind......<br /><br />Overall rating: 0/100<br /><br />DEFINITELY not recommended
B000EULJLU|5.0|I had to listen to this cd for at least a week before I thought it was even necessary to write a review. Tool has always been timely with thier cds placing quality in the highest esteem rather than pumping out a new record every other year like most hacks that people call artists are doing. Even though Maynard has been keeping busy with APC, Tool has still taken the appropriate time to put together a cd that any fan of progressive rock can truly appreciate to the fullest extent. From opening with two ear blasting beats, slowing down for the incredibly rythmic title track songs, leading to a different sound for tool with the more lyrically based Pot (reminescent of the 90's cd's), and then blasting into the continuing saga is that our escapee from A51.  <br /> <br />The cd is a well balanced mixed from the ever improving Tool. Just when you think nothing could follow their '01 release, we get a incredible piece of music that is nothing short of deity worthy.
0679736646|5.0|<br /> <br />Ubik is defiantly not for the novice, especially those who use liner narrative as a railway for thought and opinion.  <br /> <br />Do we define what is real based on what we experience? How do we know we are not in a dream or simply a character in someone else fantasy. Given the paranoid nature of PKD's writings, Ubik taps in to that subtle feeling we all have that something is not quite right with the world.  <br /> <br />PKD, himself having suffered from Schizophrenia, has remarkable insight into paranoia.  One can't help but experience a broad range of confusion as the protagonist of Ubik struggles to find a meaningful explanation for why things are not what they seem.  <br /> <br />As in the mind of PKD, things are not quite right with the world in Ubik. At points Ubik will provoke your own anxiety and pull you into a world where someone's life essence can be used up in an a sudden cascade of utter exhaustion. A world where latest Ubik models are available in a variety of colors.  A world in which people can hear each others thoughts, see the future, and use such talent for corporate espionage.   <br /> <br />Ubik explores or rather questions the nature of existence, the soul, and what is life. As our culture advances technologically, our brave new consumer world challenges our notions of life and what we know.  PKD's stories seem less like a distant future and more like someplace else in America we haven't been yet.  <br /> <br />In recent years, PKD's work has found a broader audience then the fans of Science Fiction. His works have become the feature films Blade runner, Total Recall, Imposter, The Truman Show, Minority Report, Paycheck, and most recently a Scanner Darkly.  <br /> <br />The influence of Ubik (or at least similar themes) are evident from the Outer Limits to the Matrix. In particular in Dark City, eXistenZ, Thirteen Floor, and unmistakably in the Spanish Film Abre Los Ojos (open your eyes) along with its flashy American remake, Vanilla Sky.  <br /> <br />Just aside, Vanilla Sky trades the gripping introspective qualities of Ubik found in Abre Los Ojos for some creative references to pop culture and multiple camera angles of Tom Curse striking various versions of the same pose.  <br /> <br />Ubik is one of my favorite PKD novels with themes that persist in provoking thought long after the work has been read, but only if used as directed. So use your Ubik. Take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes. <br />
0385504209|1.0|Avoid this cliche-ridden piece of rancid jetsam like the plague. It is thoughtless, plotless, depthless, pointless, and shameless.<br /><br />'Best-seller' status in AD 2006 should be warning enough, however.<br /><br />I'm now off to write a novel about Amazon's complicity in the propogation of pagan rites as revealed by their pentacle rating system.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|These DVDs are outstanding! High quality video and sound. Nothing to complain about them! Althoug I must recognize that the DVDs recorded at the Bayreuth Festival are better, we certainly cannot demerit this version of the Ring. They are also wonderful! Siegfried Jerusalem, Jessye Norman and Hildegard Behrens are simply marvelous!
B000EULJLU|4.0|Tool's 10,000 days is a bold expression of the sadness and angst of our times. But so is all of Tool's other albums. Tool's 10,000 days jams, there is no doubt about that. The cd is melodic, and you can even dance with it. It is an intimate portrayal of man versus nature. It seeks to understand the differnces and similarities to our material and spiritual existences. But so does all their albums. Even though I'm drawn more and more to this album, there is so much to find here, I'm contiunaly disappointed to hear many of the same tunes, lyrics, themes, sounds, expressions etc that they're expressed over the course of their artistic career. For example, the album's title track, 10,000 days, though emotional and gripping, seems like it is a mishmash of recycled material from all of Tool's previous efforts--Jimmy and parabola to name just a couple. I love the album, but am a bit disappointed. In the end, I must admit, Tool proves once again they're the master craftsmen of rock.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|After reading another review I guess that I was not the only one having problems with the mars disk.  it played in my car and in my cd player but i could not get it to play in my computer.  i did exchange it for another copy and it works fine now.
B000002IKR|5.0|When people think of thrash metal from the 80s, the Big Four(Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax) tend to come to mind. But if it had been the Big Five, Testament definitely would have been that fifth band. But even though they may not be as well-known, it doesn't take away from their music at all. And what good music it is! This lacks the polish of albums like Practice What You Preach, but I think that helps the music in this case. It is definitely raw, which always helps a band's first album in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Over the Wall blasts this killer album off with fast-paced and somewhat melodic riffing. When Chuck starts singing, you can tell this album will kick some ass because he sings with such power. You can't help but love it when he goes \\"Holding the quest for freedom THAT BECKONS ME!\\" Chuck gives some good shrieks on this song, and the guitar solo shows us the genius of Alex Skolnick (who was still a teenager at the time, I might add.) Very melodic and breathtaking solo, it's amazing how he could play so flawlessly at such a young age! The Haunting is a killer thrasher, with some very menacing riffs at the beginning. Chuck shows us just how fast he can sing on some parts of the song, and he also gives us some evil shrieks. My favorite one is when he goes \\"For the haunting now BEGINS!\\" Gives me goosebumps every time. Alex's solo is amazing, and pretty damn fast as well. Burnt Offerings has a very peaceful and soft intro, and Alex does some emotional guitar playing. But pretty soon the song picks up and turns into a killer metal tune. The singing and the riffs are both quite catchy and Louie's drumming is pretty good on here. Chuck's shrieks on this one are particularly sickening. Raging Waters is a mean metal song with ass-kicking riffs. Alex and Eric are both riff-masters by the way. Chuck sings the verses fast (How does he keep his breath?) and the chorus in a melodic voice. He even gives us some low growls towards the end, hinting at his later styleof singing. That is one of the many things I like about Chuck, he can sing in a low voice, a high voice, a melodic voice, you name it. Alex gives us another wild and fast guitar solo as well. Do or Die immediately grabs you with heavy riffs and stellar drum work. The chorus to this song is one of the catchiest choruses on the album, it may not sound like it fits, but you have to hear it because it really does work! Gotta love that shriek of \\"HELL IS THE PLACE YOU'LL GO!\\" Now that is a metal shriek, folks! Alex tops it all of with a good solo.  <br /> <br />Alone in the Dark starts with melodic guitar playing, which soon gets heavier. The chorus is on here is really melodic and nicely sung by Chuck, it doesn't even sound like him! If you have any doubts that he can sing, then check that chorus out! Speaking of melody, you gotta hear Alex's solo. It is wondefully done and very brilliant. Even the riffs have a bit of melody in there! C.O.T.L.O.D. is a killer speed metal song, perfect for mosh pits. Alex and Eric's riffs will beat you senseless right from the start. Louie's drumming on here is some of his best on the album, fast and crushing! I love those gang vocals of \\"Provoke the dead!\\" towards the end, and Chuck's laugh is great too. Nice little solo in there too! First Strike is Deadly has a creepy intro, but it soon turns into some awesome heavy metal! Louie is all over the drums, and the riffs on this song are metal through and through. Chuck's screams are some of best here, especailly when he goes \\"FIRST STRIKE IS DEADLY!\\" that always makes my hairs stand on end. This fantastic album ends with a fantastic closer: Apocalyptic City. It has a beautiful intro with great guitar work, but soon morphs some more kick-ass metal. \\"Burn! Feel no shame or pity/Burn! Apocalyptic City.\\" How can you not love those lyrics? Alex's solo is his best on the album. No contest at all. The melody is simply outstanding, you may find yourself rewinding the song just to hear that solo over and over again. Chuck gives one last shriek at the end, and it brings the album to a memorable close. <br /> <br />By 1987, there were many thrash bands, but I think Testament stands above many of them. Their riffs are brutal, yet catchy in a way. And I mentioned before how talented of a vocalist Chuck is. And having Alex Skolnick in your band doesn't hurt either! Trust me, if you haven't heard this guy before, then all of the praise he gets is deserved! He is not overrated in any way, his solos put him in a league of his own. This is not mainstream music, this is a raw and dirty piece of thrash metal. And if you like that mean sound in thrash (and why the hell wouldn't you?) then get The Legacy as soon as you can!

1591396190|4.0|In direct opposition to \\"environmental determinism\\", the perspective that businesses must simply accept the realities and boundaries of their markets, the Blue Ocean Strategy offers an enticing alternative.  Why not stretch the boundary or break it entirely by creating a value innovation that customers can use immediately?  Examples of Blue Ocean companies are Starbucks, The Body Shop and Cirque du Soleil.  They define their target market and function in a way that differentiates them so solidly from their competition as to leave them without much competition at all.   <br /> <br />There are six steps to the Blue Ocean Strategy: <br />1. Reconstruct market boundaries.  Strategically examine your industry's key competitive drivers. <br />2. Focus on the big picture, not the numbers.  Consider the competitive environment through your customer's eyes so that you stay focused on what matters to them. <br />3. Reach beyond existing demand.  Don't just focus on your current customers.  Look for your potential customers. <br />4. Get the strategic sequence right.  Technological innovation does not guarantee market success.  The technology must be made relevant to customers and provide value. <br />5. Overcome key organizational hurdles.   <br />6. Build execution into strategy.  Link engagement, explanation and expectation with the actual process of developing the strategy.  Executing a blue ocean strategy will require trust among your team. <br />

B000EULJLU|5.0|I've now had an entire week to digest Tool's fifth and latest studio offering, 10,000 Days.  I needed the whole week.  Like nearly anyone else who has committed themselves to truly appreciating this album, it took me time to really get a feel for it. <br /> <br />These guys are certainly the most enigmatic band I'm aware of.  They shy away from most festivals (save for Coachella), they don't jump out into the limelight, their videos don't even show their faces, and they generally are hermits.  Not that it's a bad thing, but it definitely adds to their mystique.  They can sell millions of albums just because of one reason - they just make damn good music.  10,000 Days is no exception.  Many fans who are expecting a certain sound might be disappointed.  But Tool are a very evolutionary band.  Sticking to one proven formula for every album is entirely too safe for these guys.  As singer Maynard James Keenan barks on 2001's release, Lateralus, the band have chosen to \\"spiral out, keep going.\\"   <br /> <br />That being said, while the songs on 10,000 Days may be a bit unexpected, one thing that we should always expect on a Tool release is unbelievable CD art.  No one will be disappointed in the least bit on this one.  Stereoscopic lenses built into the CD packaging?!  You've got to be kidding me!  The contest is over, give these guys a Grammy right now for Best CD Packaging.  No one will ever come close. <br /> <br />On to the music. <br /> <br />1. Vicarious (7:06).  The first single off the new album.  Immediately we are hit with the guitar and bass harmonies from Adam Jones and Justin Chancellor, respectively.  This song feels familiar with the odd timing and polyrhythmics from drum god Danny Carey.  It would be at home on Lateralus. Awesome lyrics from MJK, referencing the utter junk that we absorb ourselves into on the television, but he carefully keeps his vitriol in check by not getting too political. Great message.  Love the song, but it does feel a little bit too familiar for what I was hoping for. <br /> <br />2. Jambi (7:28).  Now is where it gets interesting!  Jones starts with a thrashy riff that we really haven't heard before, not from this band.  Can't quite tell what MJK is singing about.. perhaps his son?  Something about \\"wishing it all away\\" without pause if \\"they took you away\\".  The part where he starts singing \\"DIM MY EYES!!\\" is the MJK vocal harmony that we pine for. The one that will make your arm hairs stand at attention, and certainly remind me of something off Undertow.  Killer solo by Adam Jones!  He dug into Peter Frampton's attic and pulled out a talkbox!  Abrupt ending to the song, but it's one of the better Tooltunes I've heard across their entire catalog. <br /> <br />3. Wings for Marie (Pt 1) (6:11).  Normally we can count on track 3 on nearly any CD to  be something heavy, upbeat, possibly a single.  Tool throws us a curveball on this one.  It starts off very slow, quiet.  Soft guitar.  I can barely hear what MJK is saying.. but it's \\"you believed.. you believed in me\\".  This is one of the most experimental tracks they've ever done, but hearing the words, it's obvious this song (and subsequently the next) is a tribute to his mother, who passed away nearly three years ago. <br /> <br />4. 10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2) (11:13).  Seamless transition from the Wings Pt 1.  More soft singing, soft guitar.  Slow buildup over the first five minutes.  Great thunderstorm sound effects.  The thumping bassline and kick drum lend an almost Middle Eastern flavor to the track.  Tremendous crescendo midway through the song.  A man singing about his mother ascending as an angel.. this song is incredibly powerful.  You probably won't see a video of this song, and I doubt it will even be played live, but this is the most open and direct MJK has ever been about his personal life.  Amazing song. <br /> <br />5. The Pot (6:22).  I can't help but laugh when I read about people thinking it's not even MJK singing this song.  Yes, the song has an awkward intro.  But it's pretty cool that he has that type of flexibility in his voice.  Once the song gets going, we have a classic Tool track going very strong.  Carey and Chancellor are doing a great job of holding a beat down, and chorus is just awesome.  Venomous aura about MJK's lyrics.  This song is about the pot calling the kettle black.  Love the bridge in the middle of the song.  Jones' riffs are thick, chunky, and crunchy. The classic Tool fan in me makes me think this song absolutely kicks ass live.   <br /> <br />6. Lipan Conjuring (1:11).  A segue.  Weird, tribal chanting with what sounds like a rudimentary tambourine. <br /> <br />7. Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann) (3:46).  Another segue, but one that actually introduces the subsequent track.  Very eerie feedback effects from Jones layered behind a simple riff  Then we hear a nurse and a doctor, confronting a patient who will not speak... <br /> <br />8. Rosetta Stoned (11:11).  ..giving way to this song, starting off like a gerbil on acid.  Heavily distorted, rapidly-spat vocals.  From what I can make of it, we're hearing a story about alien abduction?  Alien encounter?  Hallucinogenics?  The meat of the song is a total showcase of Jones' excellent riffage, Carey's monumental drumming, and Chancellor's creativity on bass. It's a little bit difficult to get into at first, but it's a great track.  Will forever be known as \\"The Sh*t the Bed Song\\". <br /> <br />9. Intension (7:21).  Quickly becoming my favorite track on this album.  Revisiting the softness and subdued melody that starts the \\"Wings\\" suite, we have Jones' very simple guitar melody, Carey on what I think is a tabla and bongos, and Chancellor doing some serious slides (maybe using his Digitech Bass Whammy?) and MJK doing a chant that almost sounds Gregorian.  This song sounds like a ritualistic conjuring of spirits.  \\"Spark becomes a flame/Flame becomes a fire.\\"  Absolutely beautiful guitar melody halfway through the song, quickly helped out by what I think is the first time Tool have used a drum machine on an album.  I'm not sure who did the programming (probably Carey), but it's perfectly fitting for the song.  It lends an eerie, trip-hop feel to the track.  The song is extremely relaxing.   <br /> <br />10. Right in Two (8:55).  Another song that thrives off of a killer buildup.  Adam Jones never ceases to amaze me with his ability to write, simple, but great sounding riffs.  The first half of of the song is soft with clean riffs and quiet vocals, but leads up to a monstrous climax with Carey killing his bass drums and Jones just shredding his strings.  The lyrics imply an anti-war sentiment, and again, MJK is able to pull this off without getting too political.  A great track with a thunderous ending.   <br /> <br />11. Viginti Tres (5:02).  A noise track.  Of course we expected this, it's Tool! <br /> <br />Is it classic Tool?  In spots, yes.  It's certainly different from, say, Undertow (a CD that I believe is possibly the greatest album of all time).  But that was released 12 years ago.  No self-respecting Tool fan would ever expect them to rehash the same style of music.  The band is older now.  They are more experimental.  They are pushing the envelope (and watching it bend? LOL!  Couldn't help it, sorry!) of what rock music is about.  Some parts on this album DO rock incredibly hard - see \\"Jambi\\" and \\"The Pot\\".  But songs like the \\"Wings\\" suite and \\"Intension\\" show an introspective view into the band that we haven't yet seen.  It's an aural buffet for this reviewer.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|This doesn't suck, but after the second album, I'm constantly trying to find the band that I was SO into.  I like some weird stuff like they played on 'No Code'.  If you're a fan, you remember 'Mankind'.  THAT was a real treat. <br /> <br />I'm a fan, and this is getting closer to the Rock I wanna hear, but just not close enough. 2.5 stars actuallly.
0679731725|5.0|I have never read a book with better character voice and tone than \\"The Remains of the Day\\". Ishiguro has done a perfect job inhabiting the personality of Stevens, an aged and perfectly repressed English butler. Stevens has avoided emotional connections to anyone in his pursuit of being the perfect butler. He is not always honest with himself, so some of the beauty of the book comes from figuring things out from his reactions to people's reactions to him. The story is understated, but brilliantly done as Stevens reflects on his life and the reader begins to glimpse the problems that Stevens willfully ignored as a butler to Lord Darlington. I highly recommend \\"The Remains of the Day\\" as an absorbing and contemplative read.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Oh my.  Where do I start?  I can't say how much I love this stuff. I'm only worried I'm gonna wear this out too fast.  I can't stop playing it.  The thing is, this type of music is not easy to wear out (that's the only comparison to classic rock I can write-- but if they've got more under their sleeve like this CD, they WILL be a Classic Rock Band---let's hope they've got 30 years before that happens--).  I've seen people put 1975 as a timestamp on this type of music, but I don't agree.  Look at 1975 for a second.  For the most part, 1975 was not that good.  In those days, you had to search for good Rock.  This music is retro only in the fact that it is more ROCK AND ROLL than most people have heard in many years.  Not alternative, not punk, not grunge, and not the same nu-metal they've been hearing from 99.9% of the bands today.  Oh ya, and it's not another Alice in Chains rip-off.  I really hope the days of Alice in Chains rip-offs stop very SOON (even more annoying than the hair band days).    Well, maybe one of these tracks sounds a little like a song by Queen, but not THAT close.  Lenny Kravitz, Jet, Green Day, and a few others have flirted WAY more with plagiarism, and I like those guys too.  One band I hadn't seen put in comparison was Grand Funk.  I'm thinking I can hear that in the mix too.  They're pulling from more than a dozen influences that I can hear and that's real good in my book no matter what music you play.  I listened to The Darkness a couple years ago and wanted so much to not laugh and hear a band that could actually pull off an album such as this one, but compared to this... they were just a joke.     I play guitar.  This music is not as difficult to play as it is to write (for me).  That's because this is the music I have always been into.  By the time I got 1/2 way into this CD and realized I wasn't laughing or saying 'that sounds like...'--> I knew.  These guys got the 'feel' and 'atmosphere' of a really great record.      Thanks Wolfmother.      One more thought:  Rock and Roll is alive and well, and this is not only the best rock album I've heard this year, it may be the best in a long, long, LONG time.  I like Standard Blues, Real Country, Dance, Classical, Standard Pop, Classic Rock, Hair Bands, Grunge, Alternative, Nu-Metal, Bluegrass, Jazz, Slow Jazz, Folk, Punk, but this music deserves it's own format that our Almighty Guitar Gods wanted back in the day :)
0618526412|4.0|This is a beautifully written novel about dreams and being alone. Ordinary, flawed yet likeable people seek to transcend the poor, rough life that they live and to make their dreams reality. They are drawn to a deaf-mute, John Singer, who somehow everyone sees as being the only one who understands them. He himself is more isolated than any of them, because he is deaf and has no way to talk to anyone. <br />\\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" weaves a spellbinding tragedy, woven from the lives of several people. It was a page-turner, despite not having a fast-moving plot, because of the emotional power of the tale.  <br />I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the ending. It was a wonderful book, but the ending is so depressing, without a glimmer of hope for any character. Still, a moving story that will have a profound impact on the reader.
0451529308|5.0|This book is a wonderful book that tells the story of 4 girls who are living during the Civil war and trying to cope with their father away at war and their mother who is busy trying to make ends meet until their father returns. This book is great and touching. You see how unselfish these girls are and how they will do anything to help their mother. But this book also shows conflicts that arise between sisters. I recommend mothers and daughters and sisters to all read this book. ITs a great memory to share togehter.
B000EULJLU|5.0|First of all Tool is the best, most talented band of all time To have even one band member with this much talent is unheard of but all four are the best in what they do. You can tell they can connect their true emotions in thier music. Lateralus to me is flawless its their best work and to me the best album ever made. It takes you in and you feel like your out of your body, its so intense that it makes the hair stand up.... Aenima to me is just as good in a different way. At the time I thought they couldn't get any better from Aenima but to me they kept the intensity and pure chemistry going and got even better for Lateralus.  Waiting and waiting for this new album I was 100 percent thinking they were going to put their all into this album and even evolve more, but when I really listen to this album it seems like Maynards full attention isn't in Tool any more. To me the band still has it going but the direction of the music evolves from all four and I think Maynard isn't in the same mindset as the rest of the band anymore. There is three extremely good songs on this album but to me Right in Two is really the only song on this album where they are hitting on all cylinders. Rosetta Stoned is very good and its Tool alright but its still only 9 out of 10 stars. Rosetta Soned seems like they were still back in Aenema days when to me they have grown better than that. The song 10,000 Days is good but not up to par. Vicarius to me isn't even true Tool it seems forced. And the rest of the album to me isn't even Tool. I gave this album a five star rating mainly because I still look at Tool as the best band of all time. Was I dissapointed? ... Yes. Is it a good album? Yes..... but not the Tool they are capable of being. I will give Danny props for his contribution. Adam didn't seem all there on this album. It's still to me there third best album. Should you buy it? yes but only for a few songs.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is brilliant.  This is Audio Milton woven with fury and wonder.  This is mythology.  This is Greek tragedy. <br /> <br />What fascinates me about Tool is their progression.  Sure, I love their granite rock.  I love Keenan's primal, extended screams, via \\"Let Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee in.\\" <br /> <br />But there's no stasis in the imagination of the true artist.  Tool recognizes the past and builds upon it, transforms experience into something startling and new. <br /> <br />Quite frankly, 10,000 Days is a dangerous album.  It elicits gooseflesh and tempts with rising crescendos.  Both music and epic radiate with each revolution of the disc. <br /> <br />Be careful.  You will be enthralled.
B000E33VWW|5.0|The performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman was so good,it made me think you are watching the real Truman Capote just like watching Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles.The editing,camera work,costumes,the sets and the acting was the best.This movie should had won more awards it was nominated for.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I would not say that this was one of Burtons best films just because he has made so many great one such as such as \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\", \\"Beetlejuice\\", \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Batman\\" ect: but \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is certinaly good, You can tell that it is made by Mr. Burton mostly because the Shapes, colors & Characors have Burton written all over them!, Johnney Depp again delivers a knock out performance as Willie Wonka In what I thought was deserving of the Golden Globe for best performance in a Musical or comedy and a nomination for an oscar! Burton pours his heart into this film trying to make it more like the book rather than the 70's \\"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\". <br /> <br />In my opinion this is not as good as the 70's \\"Willie Wonka\\" but is quite good none the less, I though that they cut a few good things out and I also have to admitt that I was rather dissapointed with the new \\"Oompa Loompas\\"... But the misbehaving children in this one were better than the one's in the 70's! <br /> <br />The visuals in this movie were actually great and if you see how much money this movie cost to make you will see why ... One a new topic, some of the line sused in this film were drop dead hilarious such as ...  <br /> <br />Everything that you see in this room is edible, even I'm edible but that is what we call \\"Cannablism\\" and frowned upon in Most modern society's .... (Wonka) <br /> <br />\\"Was'nt that wonderful!, It started out a little slow but that ending ... I mean .... WOW! (Wonka) <br /> <br />\\"The ..........................\\" (Wonka) <br /> <br />\\"Parents?\\" (little girl) <br /> <br />\\"Yeah ... Mom's and Dad's!  (Wonka) <br /> <br />........ OOOOOOO you have to watch the film to understand!, I recommend this film to EVERYONE because this summer of 2005 boxoffice hit is really quite a fun filled and entertaining Burton Film. But let me say it again .... it's not as good as the original ....  <br /> <br />Grade: B+ <br />
1401301010|4.0|i have always been a fan of anthony kiedis. lets face it he's a hottie. but it wasnt until i saw rhcp live at ellis island a few years ago for the \\"by the way\\" debut that i was hooked. i have seen them live 3 times & cant wait til the next. i was at the book signing in manhattan when the book came out & i was star struck being face to face with anthony. i didnt have a clue as to what to say. i blurted something stupid & walked off. i then read the book from cover to cover barely putting it down. it had me. every spare moment i had i was reading and i am not much of a reader. the tv is usually what i watch in my spare time. the book was funny, sad, sometimes shocking, there were some disturbing parts. but all & all a great read. i wish i can talk to him about this book. there is alot i would ask and say to him. its amazing how he remembered half these stories being that he was messed up pretty much most of the time but the fact that he came clean & has grown both as a song writer & person is impressive. i think alot of us, being a product of the 70's & 80's can relate to the drug age & casual sex days & i have lost alot of friends along the way who were not as lucky as i was. i think he is a lucky guy for surviving all of this & looking forward to more from him in the future. this was a great book, i recommend it highly...
B000EULJLU|4.0|I will not delve deep into the mythos that has become Tool's career in music.  That has been stated far more eloquently by the original die-hard members of the ToolArmy several times already.  Those of you who hang on every thing that is Tool will have already purchased this CD and a review would not change that.  For those of you checking them and this CD out, I have two pieces of advice: 1) BUY IT  2) Be patient.  As many have said already, this CD is not meant to grab you, shake you around and beat its message into you.  It is subtle, it is very well thought out and it flows extremely well.  And most importantly of all, it is quite incredible.  This thing has been in my car stereo from the first day I got it.  If you have any interest in this genre of music or are even curious, don't miss out.  Fantastic. <br /> <br />p.s. Try and track down some lyrics for the songs and listen along with them.  The story and messages jump off the page as you read Maynard's lyrics.

0783240287|3.0|I was very pleased with the rapid delivery without having to pay extra.  I loved the stage play version , and the music , but the dvd-version leaves something to be desired.  I was dismayed that the producers felt it necessary to use near/nudity for the Egyptian female's costumes - totally not necessary - more like something you would expect in a Las Vegas burlesque show!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|We are waiting 4 years for this and now we can listen to it and judge it... so IS THIS THEIR BEST? <br />Of course and it is not only their best but one of the best ever albums and the best double album by far!!!
0440237688|4.0|I thought The Giver was a great book.  It was very interesting and each page I read the more I wanted to continue reading it.  Some of the things that made it interesting is seeing him find out about the real truth about his community.  I think it was interesting to see that because once he turned twelve years old his whole entire life changed and he learned new things from a man named The Giver.<br /><br />  The Giver had a major affect on how Jonas, the main character, lived his life.  I thought this book was filled with great details and some good metaphors. A good metaphor in the book is when the author describes Jonas' eyes as being unusual and different.  I think he meant the Jonas sees things differently then everybody else as you can tell from the book and how he acts.  Some of the books great details are about where he lives and the things that go on.  Like when they tell about the aircraft flying over his community and the trouble his friends got into telling people they would be released from the community when they were mad and not really meaning to say it.<br /><br />  It was also a great plot.  The community they live in seems interesting and you can almost picture it in your mind if you think about it.  I did enjoy this book because of the metaphors and how you can picture things through the author's details.  I think a lot of people would really enjoy this book if they read it.
0452283760|5.0|Fountainhead is a classic book in its own right. But as someone said in these reviews that you don't have to buy a philosophy completely in order to like it. I love the ideas of Ayn Rand but I don't buy them all like any 'second hander' would. For this reason my review contains criticism of Objectivism ( That has the tendency to become crypto- Nazism). It is just my opinion and I'm just using my freedom of expression for the sake of discussion as it is impossible for many to read Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and not dream up political parties!<br /><br /> Ayn Rand's brilliance shines and grips the reader from page 1. You're wildly engrossed by the mystique of this young Howard Roark. You Wonder, What he's upto? And you start your journey into the ideal of Individualism and the trend of the Crowd/ The herd/ The Collectivist/ The Second-hander.<br /><br />Mind you, this book is dangerous in the sense you may end up buying more than you would like to bargain! Ayn Rand is hauntingly convincing. It hits your mind and the soul. It agitates, stimulates and provokes you to think... question... think again.<br /><br />But I was delighted to read this book because I already held most of the ideals of the book very high in my heart and they were only confirmed as I read Fountainhead. It is exhilarating to discover that someone somewhere in this Universe not only shares your deepest thoughts but has profoundly manifested them in beautiful writing.<br /><br />CRITICISM- Of course few months after the reading you will be able to shake off your initial mania ( If you passively  buy  Rand's Objectivism) and you would see the holes in the philosophy of Objectivism. It is OK to disagree with Rand on some points as Objectivism requires us to be objective and listen to our OWN conscience/ Reason!<br /><br />For start, why must one disbelieve the existence of God to subscribe to Objectivism/ Individualism? Objectivism and Atheism must come together, because God DOES NOT EXIST, so says the Objectivist. Hmmm.. No one has seen black holes either but many believe in their existence, same is true with the dark matter and many other phenomena etc.. I think Agnosticism (on the question of God) would not be too irrational, better still... let it be a matter of one's conscience.<br /><br />Second, I question Howard Roark's morality and fairness. His first love- making with Dominique is a sort of consensual rape (???). Then he forgets her. Then he starts the sexual relationship again and continues it without any compunctions even when Dominique is married. Maybe he considers that the ethical issue regarding committing adultery is a religious diktat, a selfish, rational man is above that moral [...] ? I am not sure. I found it a behavior that undermines his integrity. It might sound harsh but for the sake of truth it is important to mention (in this review) that there is a very firm evidence that Ms. Rand herself carried on a long term/ intimate affair with much younger married man while she was still married to her husband. Both their spouses knew about it but were not allowed to interfere.<br /><br />Same UNAPOLOGETIC/ NONCHALANT adultery is portrayed in Atlas Shrugged between Mr. Reardon (who is a married man with a beautiful, devout-mostly- wife) and Miss Taggart. I found their first sex act to be a very funny scene where Mr. Reardon declares he has always lusted after Miss Taggart and that he is a sex animal of some sort who would not mind giving up his every ambition, dream and industrial empire just to have Miss Taggart as his bonk buddy. What in the Dickens was that???? I still crack up when I think of that fall of superman and superwoman for a night of nookie. Hilarious and UNNOTICED BY Randmaniacs.<br /><br />And what about Howard Roark being the poster boy for Cigarette companies. Our hero is a chain smoker of sorts and the picture is supposed to become romantic when Roark and Dominique smoke together. hmmmm... Why must a rational man smoke? Incidentally, Ms. Rand herself was a smoker and was diagnosed with lung cancer later in life...<br /><br />Another small thing that kind of confuses me, is Ms. Rand's consistent portrayal of THE IDEAL MAN or WOMAN as someone with Blond/ Red hair. What is with the hair colour? If only Anglo Saxon race is the ideal human race then rest of the planet is screwed and that's a lot of screwed people stuck in eternal doom because they are not the right race. Ayn Rand happened to be Jewish to thicken the plot...<br /><br />  Coming back to the mind of Roark, I find, Roark's most striking statement that contradicted all his other statements was his admission to Dominique, ''I LOVE YOU.'' I found it so glaring an expression coming from him. Love and submission is exactly against his militant beliefs about his selfishness, ego. Love = sacrifing yourSELF to other Self, that is anti- Self. But anyhow, Roark lets Dominique be the sexual plaything for two other men (She even marries both of them!) One more inconsistency in his integrity.<br /><br />His reverence, deep respect and submission to his mentor Architect in the beginning of the book is another notable example that shows Roark got a very soft, caring, humane and even EMOTIONAL nature. He is not cold, selfish and rational all times as the book seems to suggest in some parts.<br /><br />Great Novel from a great author--- But don't get me wrong because of above points. I had to mention them as - though I absolutely love this book- I cannot understand why some poeple want to make religion out of couple of novels. It seems some sort of 'Inerrancy of Ayn Rand, transliteration of Objectivism as personified in very entertaining novels'. It's just too much hype and mawkishness really.<br /><br />Such idol worship aside, DO READ Fountainhead whenever you get a chance. Most possibly, it will be one of the greatest AND VERY ENTERTAINING books you will ever read. This book has a great plot, very interesting characters; Toohey's character has been  developed terrifically. Even I was duped in the beginning of the book that Toohey was a good man! His character is an enigma really. Though he is the promoter of second handers he himself is a genius and a devilish manipulator. Rand presents him as a diabolical communist of sorts as she herself had strong hatred of communist ideology, mostly because of her experiences/impressions of Soviet Union.<br /><br />And surely, there is a great inspirational theme that boils down to: BE YOURSELF/ NEVER IMITATE other human beings/ NEVER BORROW SOMEONE ELSE'S IDEAS/ NEVER SEEK ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR THOUGHTS OR ACTIONS... in words of Rand There is absolutely no need to SACRIFICE SELF TO OTHERS AND VICE VERSA.

B000002VC5|5.0|This is my personal favorite Project album, but the one that took me the longest to get into.  It is the only Project album with no weak songs on it. <br /> <br />The album opens with the title track instrumental, one of the Project's best instrumentals.  The music is haunting, and fits the mood perfectly.  Turn it up at the beginning, and what you hear is very good. <br /> <br />Next comes I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You, an excellent song sung by Lenny Zakatek, probably my favorite Project singer.  The title gives the basic idea of the song.  Listen to the first forty or so seconds, and the way it shifts between earpieces is an experience. <br /> <br />Some Other Time is another excellent Project song, and perhaps the best on the album.  The imagery is excellent, and the line \\"could it be that somebody is looking into my mind\\" is one of the best lines of any Project song. <br /> <br />Breakdown actually comes before Some Other Time, I think, and is an excellent track.  The wordplay Woolfson uses in the song is excellent.  However, the chorus at the end really detracts from the song.  I understand how it fits, but it still detracts. <br /> <br />Don't Let it Show is one of the Project's best ballads.  The organ is absolutley incredible.  This should not be overlooked. <br /> <br />The Voice is a song that I have never quite figured out how to deal with.  The clapping in the middle annoys me to no end, but the rest of the song is pretty good.  Not great, but good. <br /> <br />Nucleues is a short, eerie instrumental.  Some would call it filler, but it sets the tone for the album, in many ways. <br /> <br />Day After Day is a third excellent Project ballad, well worth many listens.  It is the worst of the three on the album, which is high praise for the other two. <br /> <br />Total Eclipse is the first of two instrumentals to end the album.  The chanting makes this sound appropriate for a horror film, but it also fits on this album. <br /> <br />The album ends with Genesis Ch.1 V.32.  It should be noted that there are 31 verses in Genesis.  This is a very good closing instrumental. <br /> <br />The overall album follows a theme of a world controlled by robots, which it does very well, never straying too far, but never adhering too strictly.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|16 years after Tim Burton stunned audiences and critics with his believable and dark motion picture version of Batman, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) has remade the movie with an even more believable premise and darker edge.    After Burton and Batman star Michael Keaton left the Batman series in 1992 with Batman Returns, the sequels got worse and ridiculous (Joel Schumacher literally destroyed the Batman installments with Batman Forever, with Val Kilmer as Batman, and Batman And Robin, with George Clooney turning Batman into a smiling dummy). Nolan succeeds in bringing back the seriousness of the original Batman, with Christian Bale (The Machinist) donning the bat suit this time around.    As the title prescribes, the film explores Bruce Wayne's gradual emergence into the dark caped superhero, and in the process resurrects the death of his rich and famous parents. The film then shows Bruce getting picked up and raised by the family's butler Alfred, played by Michael Caine (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), departing from Gotham to no man's land where he learns the skills of fighting on the hands of ninja warrior Ducard, played by Liam Neeson (Gangs Of New York), being initiated into but refusing to join a dark cult known as the League of Shadows led by Ra's Al Ghul, played by Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), returning to a corrupt and crime-ridden Gotham city, reestablishing a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes, played by Katie Holmes, and vowing to bring back order to the city that his father help build, and in return got him killed, while in the process fight a relentless enemy known as The Scarecrow, played brilliantly by Cilian Murphy (Red Eye), with a little help from an honest detective named Jim Gordon, played by Gary Oldman (State Of Grace, JFK).     Nolan's directing never fails, while Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman is only second best to, if not equal to, Michael Keaton's. Whether you agree with me or not, Batman Begins is destined to be a new beginning for yet another adventurous and exciting Batman franchise, just as long as Joel Schumacher stays away!

B000002VCT|5.0|This is one of my favorite Alan Parsons Project Album.  I was randomly surfing my Dad's iPod, and he was once a huge Parsons fan.  I found the song What Goes Up..., and I played it.  It was the only song on this album that he had, but I absolutely loved.  I knew I needed to have more of this guy's work. <br /> <br />I was kept from getting this album for a long time, unfortunately, but once I did get it, I fell in love.  The entire album is centered lyrically around pyramids, and musically around one four note arrangement.  I am not good with music, but I noticed the sequence in Voyager, The Eagle Will Rise Again, In the Lap of the Gods, and I think some other places, too. <br /> <br />The album opens with the instrumental Voyager.  This is a very good instrumental, but it is short, and ends about when it should be beginning.  This is not a bad thing though, as it transitions perfectly into What Goes Up.... <br /> <br />What Goes Up... was, for the longest time, my favorite song.  It is a very mystical song, and is one of Woolfson's best lyrical efforts, and the instrumental interlude in the middle is not overdone (as it is in Silence and I and Ammonia Avenue, neither of which are on this album).  This was the first Project song I heard, and it's still one of my favorites. <br /> <br />The Eagle Will Rise Again is one of my favorite Project ballads.  This was the Project's strongpoint (ballads, that is), and this is no exception.  It is absolutely amazing.  Next comes my least favorite song, One More River.  While Lenny Zakatek generally sings my favorite Project songs, he also generally sings my least favorite, and this falls into the second category.  He is very talented, but his talents go to waste here. <br /> <br />Can't Take It With You is a weak effort by the Project, but it is better than One More River.  It is about crossing to the afterlife, but the lyrics are a bit superficial. <br /> <br />The album returns to form with the very good intrumental (with chanting) In the Lap of the Gods.  It is long, but also good. <br /> <br />Then comes Pyramania, the closest thing to a title track this album has.  It is an absolutely wonderful song about Pyramid Power, making fun of the legend that if you put a razor blade in a pyramid, it got sharper (but they do that anywhere).  This spurred people to put pyramids everywhere, claiming various effects (i.e. improving your food).  This is the most unique Project song there is, and one of the best. <br /> <br />Hyper-Gamma-Spaces follows, and is the best instrumental on the album.  It is fun and upbeat.  The album ends with Shadow of a Lonely Man, the second and lesser of the two ballads on the album, though still quite good. <br /> <br />This is an excellent starting place for those just getting into the Project, and a must-have for fans.

0689865384|4.0|_Uglies_ is the first book in a new trilogy for young adult readers by Scott Westerfeld. In a dystopian future, all \\"uglies\\" (people unaltered by plastic surgery) look forward to their 16th birthdays when they will become one of the envied \\"pretties.\\" Tally Youngblood is counting down the days until that magical birthday when she will at last become pretty and join her older friends for endless parties and fun in New Pretty Town. Her new friend, Shay, does not share her desire for prettiness. Just before their shared birthday, Shay leaves Uglyville behind and runs away to live outside the city. The authorities want Shay back, and they plan to use Tally to get her: they will turn Tally pretty only if she turns Shay in. <br /> Westerfeld's book is a riveting read, with plenty of action and an engagingly well-developed main character in Tally. Below the surface story, though, is an important commentary on the lengths people will go to in the pursuit of physical perfection. Westerfeld's book may be set in the future, but it deals with the same issues that young adults face today, such as the media's portrayal of perfection, body image, and peer pressure. In this new world, prettiness for all is meant to put everyone on equal footing. Perhaps the pretties are equal to one another, but the average are taught to focus on their flaws and hate themselves in order to preserve the status quo. In Tally's case, the idea of remaining average is so abhorrent that it is used as a weapon. Will Tally find the strength to resist societal pressure and find the extraordinary within herself? Or is being pretty and popular more important than integrity and true friendship? <br />
B000002LK1|4.0|If you're new to the band, this represents a great place to check them out. On this one, the group has made both some of their most accessible music (3 US hit singles spawned from this disc) as well as a very cohesive listen with only a dip or two. It's also the last of their burbling keyboard \\"80s\\" sound. After this one, the group would incorporate more and more guitars and de-emphasize the \\"tech\\".<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />Buoyant and sensual, \\"World in my Eyes\\" leads off the album on the right foot. (\\"Now let your mind do the walking/And let my body do the talking/Let me show you the world in my eyes\\") While  a chart stiff Stateside, Brits pushed it to the #17 spot. #8 U.S. smash \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" is probably the most addictive cut here though many can't remember the name of it. (You know, the one that goes 'All I ever wanted/All I ever needed/is here/in my arms...) Beyond that, dance-floor filler \\"Personal Jesus\\" [#20 U.S.] continues to be a favorite in clubs though its probable origins as a secular hymn of sorts has been taken by many as a more direct Christian anthem. [In fact, country legend Johnny Cash covered it, interpreting it no doubt as a mission statement for Christians at an individual level because of lines like \\"Things on your chest/You need to confess/I will deliver/You know I'm a forgiver\\"] while anti-honesty anthem \\"Policy of Truth\\" rounds out the hit trio (#15 in the U.S. (\\"Hide what you have to hide/And tell what you have to tell/You'll see your problems multiplied/If you continually decide/To faithfully pursue/The policy of truth\\") Beyond the hits, \\"Halo\\" also hits the mark. The song tells a guilt-wracked lover to lay down their  'halo in reverse' of shame. (\\"And when our worlds/They fall apart/When the walls come tumbling in/Though we may deserve it/It will be worth it\\")<br /><br />LOWS:<br />The weakest cuts here are wimpy ballad \\"Waiting for the Night\\" and overlong \\"Blue Dress\\".<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />A pretty consistently rewarding listen.

I am an avid reader, and there are some books which I have read more than once, but when I think about them years - or even months - later, I cannot for the life of me remember some of the main charactors' names. It is not so with this book. I could not forget it, or stop loving it, no matter what!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|what an enjoyable cd. combining these two artists is a thrill.i've listened several times and continue to play it over. their voices combined with knopfler's musicianship add up to great entertainment.
B000EPR7NE|4.0|We will not know for some ten days whether Hans Zimmer's score for Ron Howard's much atticipated film version of Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" will work for the film, but it seems a good fit.  Indeed, one might have wished to have this music as background for reading or re-reading the controversial novel.  An early review of the score seemed disappointed, but this is a solid piece that clearly stands well as a soundtrack album, and it may well be a musical cipher to the code.  Yes, there is an abundunce of \\"somber strings,\\" ominous even menacing undertones and mystery, \\"compelling choir,\\" and dramatic currents that abound. It is hardly quiet, save where it needs be, and perhaps lacks a thematic zinger (though a typical version of a Zimmer theme emerges late in the score rising to a crescendo in \\"Chevlaliers de Sangreal\\"), but it is quite effective, and indeed quite beautiful in places.  This is the kind of score that usually works well on the screen but often does not translate into a good listen at home in the den.  Zimmer has woven his strings, undertones, bells, piano, percussion, currents and crosscurrents, and his choral variations into an impressive score.  Over the next few days this writer fully intends to read the novel again (not for enlightenment, but for fun) and this recording is the perfect companion for it, and it will almost surely work with Howard's film adaptation.  A very good recording, and nicely packaged by Decca.
0440241588|1.0|Most of the book is about learning Italian and food.  Not joking.  If you read the book, you may learn how to say something in Italian, probably something food-related.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Like anyone at this point, I only got an initial impression of the record, albeit a strong one, since I gave it my full attention and listened on a good sound system, in a silent environment. To sum it up, it's a very well-writen, artistic, and enjoyable album. <br /> <br />It's a surprise. The more you know and have followed the band through its previous records, the more you'll be surprised at the  level of songwriting they have reached (think Beatles-level). Originality (or the -successful- pursuing of it) is a constant. Where it isn't completely original, it is a stellar interpretation of existing structures. <br /> <br />It's an achievement. There is no price to be paid for all this creativity: it never sounds idiotic, pretentious, or aggressive - but free and humble. Even the most daring propositions (like Animal Bar) sound pleasing. Rick (the producer) and the recording guys are to be taken credit for this, alongside the band. <br /> <br />It's funky, in more than one defition. 'The funk is back', for whom it makes sense, is a true affirmation. Flea actually sounds fat for the first time since Blood Sugar Sex Magik (the band's reference funk record), due to a different choice of instrument. On the Mars half, Anthony is heard using his voice in ways that inevitably remind us of that record, and earlier ones. Where the music gets obviously funky, the mix also gets propositally old-school and rough, to further bring us memories of things as remote as 'American Ghost Dance'. <br /> <br />It's strange. I began my experience with the album by reading the lyrics and looking at the artwork. They communicate confusion, uncertainty, chaos. Anthony's writing suggests disenchantment with our world, alleviated by cheap pleasures and distractions. He never sounds actually sad like he does on By the Way, but true happiness is equally absent. The whole experience, music added, forms a landscape non-coincidentally reminescent of our real world. <br /> <br />It's a development. Chad today is the same musician as he has been since Californication (his big growth happened much earlier, beginning with One Hot Minute). He's the only estatic one though. Anthony shows a new level of control over his voice, enabling him to deliver the perfect beauty of 'Especially in Michigan'. Flea finally takes (or accepts, or reaches?) the liberty to take that intrincate, spontaneous approach, characteristic of his live jams, to the studio. John keeps the voice layering going, this time flawlessly throughout the record, and masters his guitar into new sounds that rocket-propel the music forwards. <br /> <br />It's too much for a jewel case. In my local Brazilian pressing exemplar, the fat booklet doesn't fit easily into the plastic, resulting in a damaged booklet. The plastic holding the discs also doesn't open smoothly, which caused one of my discs to fall music-side-down to the ground. Today's cases are real bad, this album deserves a better one. <br /> <br />A great album to have that is never going to bother you. A must have for Peppers fans.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Speaking from the mouths of all Chili fans. This album is diverse in the idea that tracks are all unique, some more vocal and acoustic than others. We do not omit Flea's sick bass style playing. Although this album focuses its attention on Anthony's vocals more so than it does the musical efforts. A good double album, and worth the wait, thanks for the birthday gift guys!
B000ENV2P0|5.0|FINALLY!  I have been waiting for what seems like forever for this 28 playlist and WOW, what a value!  This album is rocking and classic Chilis and new and and and...  WOW, what can I say other than YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!  All the hype has been worth it.  The rich vibes, the playful lyrics that Chili Pepper diehards love are here.  There is a great article in SPIN this month about this album and what the guys are up to.  For a band that started as a joke, this is NO JOKE, this is serious rock n roll...  The Dani California video is hilarious and the making of it is even better.  LONG LIVE THE CHILI PEPPERS!!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Stadium Arcadium is a double cd, and as such is subject to all the bad associations that these releases have. Luckily for all RHCP fans, the result is better than you could have hoped for. The cds, called \\"Mars\\" and \\"Jupiter\\", are both full of catchy, funky tracks. Newcomers to the band will be able to dive right in, while hardcore fans will find that some of the material harks right back to the early days of \\"Blood Sex Sugar Magik\\" and \\"Freakey Styley\\". <br /> <br />Disc One Songs:  <br />Dani California: the lead single, very catchy. 4/5 <br />Snow (Hey Oh): great melody here. Great slower song. 5/5 <br />Charlie: excellent chorus. Kiedis in fine form here. 4/5 <br />Stadium Arcadium: the title track is slow and melancholy. Great use of the choir just like on Dani California. 3.5/5 <br />Hump de Bump: funky and fresh. Come have come straight off Freakey Styley. 3.5/5 <br />She's Only 18: a bit slower again, some good work from John here. 3/5 <br />Slow Cheetah: great melody, loses a bit at the chorus though. 3.5/5 <br />Torture Me: rocking out guitars, really strong song. Kiedis sounds frenzied, and Flea's bassline backs him up. 4.5/5 <br />Strip My Mind: starts off with some great chord arrangements from John. A bit too slow for my liking. 3/5 <br />Especially in Michigan: great bassline again. Just think of all the words than rhyme with Michigan... 4/5 <br />Warlocks: now I am convinced this is a Freakey Styley b-side kept for a few years...funky and exciting, even if the lyrics are a bit strange. 4/5 <br />C'mon Girl: catchy chorus, another \\"spoken\\" sounding song in the Peppers unique style. 4/5 <br />Wet Sand: I don't think this song knows quite where it wants to go... that said, its not bad, good use of different styles. 3/5 <br />Hey: seems a bit like a filler song. The chorus is pretty unimaginative and pretty unmemorable. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />Disc Two Songs:  <br />Desecration Smile: good sing-a-long song. Memorable and fun. 4/5 <br />Tell Me Baby: excellentsong, starts funky then goes melodic. Love the lyrics too. 4.5/5 <br />Hard To Concentrate: a wedding song from Anthony to John apparently. A bit slow, certainly a change from the old Chilis. 3.5/5 <br />21st Century: bouncing bass, Flea at his best. 4/5 <br />She Looks to Me: slower and memorable. Good lyrics too. 4/5 <br />Readymade: rockier sound, chords all over the place! But it works. 4/5 <br />If: predominantly acoustic song. Not really my thing but may appeal to some. 2.5/5 <br />Make You Feel Better: in my opinion, the best track on the album. Simple chords, Kiedis spits out the lyrics wonderfully. Someone said that the chorus sounds kind of like a Friends theme.. if so, bring that show back. Love it. 5/5 <br />Animal Bar: another great track, not quite sure what it's about..Simple guitar work but effective. 4.5/5 <br />So Much I: John goes nuts here, and the results are great. Signature RHCPs. It goes from slow to fast effortlessly. 4.5/5 <br />Storm in a Teacup: another old school track, fun and catchy. 4/5 <br />We Believe: slower, background lyrics are good here. 3.5/5 <br />Turn It Again: great chorus, another fun track. Long too, with some great solos near the end. 4/5 <br />Death of a Martian: apparently about the death of a pet. Good track, nice melody and lyrics. 4/5 <br /> <br />Disc two is slightly better in my opinion. Overall a very strong release, worth waiting for. If you like the Chili Peppers at all, and have a previous album, get this one. There is something for everyone here.  <br />
B0002F6AH0|5.0|As documentaries go, this one is a legend. Quite simply this documentary series has few peers; it is equal to, if not greater than Sir Kenneth Clark's \\"Civilization\\" or Alistair Cooke's \\"America.\\"  Rarely has global conflict on television been presented so well and so completely. From start to finish, and without the gee-whiz CGI and animation that characterize so many lesser documentaries on the History Channel, \\"World at War\\" still stands out at the top of the heap.<br /><br />Now, even after 30 years (the series was produced in 1973), this series is exemplary in both narration and the original (and rare!) film footage used. Retrospectives and interviews with the director and other individuals involved in the production share illuminating and revealing thoughts about the making of the series.  The installments and footage on early Nazi Germany are surprisingly good as is the coverage of the war in North Africa.  Unlike the BBC's \\"History of WWII\\" there are no \\"re-enactments\\" of Dunkirk using extras--this is, for the most part, a straight-forward presentation of the war, the facts behind it, its aftermath, and how it has shaped the world today.<br /><br />The series has a number of interviews with many of the principal players from both sides including Albert Speer (Hitler's architect and Minister of Works) and Adolf Galland (one of the most decorated German flying aces from the war) and other notable personalities from the war that are now, of course, deceased. They tell us candidly of Hitler, his ambitions, and his madness.<br /><br />Rarely does a documentary series stand the test of time like this one does.

0425152251|3.0|I am sure this is a good book for those of you who are interested in the history of philosophy. This book was interesting in the way it presented the information to you. I enjoyed the background plot more than the idea of philosophy. But then I am not one to get too philosophical about much. Go for it if you are up for a challenge. It is worth the time and effort.
0679422714|1.0|As a work of history this book is terrible. As a work of dubious fictional value, I guess it'll do. The author has an obvious axe to grind here and it shows thru on every page. Blanket claims are made and without any proof. Just the authors opinion. That is fine in a work without significance, but not in a historical book. I guess maybe I was expecting something from this book that it wasn't. As a  serious look at Mao and communist China this book is a major disapointment.
B000002LQR|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers-BloodSugarSexMagik *****<br /><br />Long considered the essential Red Hot Chili Peppers album, BloodSugarSexMagik really is the ultimate Chili Peppers album, well until Stadium Arcadium that is. Gangling guitars, funky bass, nice groove filled drumming, good vocals and lyrics and lots of energy. Sounds like every other Chili Peppers album huh, except this is better then all the others. Never sticking with one style of music for way to long this album jumps from funk to punk to hard rock to soul and every thing in between. It's impossible to get bored with this album because it is all over the place. Anthony Keidis' vocals are great here and his lyrics are some of his all time best in places. John Frushanti plays amazing guitar as always, Flea tares up the bass as usual, and Chad Smith dominates the drum set.<br /><br />The album opens up with `The Power Of Equality' which starts of with a nice intro and then dives right into the album head first. Great rocker with nice bass and it is a awesome way to start off the album. `If You Have To Ask' is next. A song filled with great guitar and a killer solo by John. The chorus is very, very catchy. It is sure to be one of your favorites on the album. `Breaking The Girl' slows things down a little bit for a nice change of pace. Before buying this album most people have no idea that the Chili Peppers have this side to their music, it is a slower acoustic ballad with some of Anthony Keidis' best lyrics and an all time favorite. `Breaking The Girl' is one of the bands all time best songs. `Funky Monks' has one of the coolest guitar riffs of all time. It is nothing short of amazing. It is so funky it hurts. The semi autobiographical lyrics are a nice touch to a fun song. Once again the band knows how to write a catchy chorus, one that will for sure be stuck in your head in the morning. Next is the first hit single off the album, `Suck My Kiss.' This song is still all over the radio to this day. Lyrics that only Anthony Keidis could create make this song an essential listen. A heavy bass line compliment this track perfectly. A personal favorite is next. `I Could Have Lied' is simply put one of the very best songs every written and recorded. The lyrics are extremely beautiful and the slow acoustic music is excellent for the atmosphere. The electric guitar solo's over the acoustic guitar is perfect one of John Frushantis' bigger shining moments as a masterful guitar player. This is one song you will press repeat for. `Mellowship Slinky In B Major' sounds like a throw back to the classic funk days of the 1970's with Parliament Funkadelic with Bottsy Collins and George Clinton. A great song that really show the band influences. `The Righteous And The Wicked' is a killer song. One of the better songs on the album. Great background vocals, and another great chorus. The whole band plays together perfectly on this track. Next is another classic Chili Peppers song and a major hit single in it's day. `Give It Away' is a fast paste song with really great guitar and out of this world bass. Chad Smith's Drumming is the heart of this song if you ask me though. Keidis' rapping ability comes through here and it's funny because he is actually really good at it. The killer title track is next, `BloodSugarSexMagik' is one of the bands all time best songs. The chorus alone is worth the price of this album, It's a personal favorite, one of my all time favorite songs. It's hard to explain because it is one of those songs that must be heard to appreciate. Next is a little song called `Under The Bridge' which is only really the bands essential song and the one that made them the massive rock starts that they are today, and for good reasons it is one of the most amazing songs ever written. The lyrics are absolutely beautiful, blissful. John's guitar playing will most likely never top this song. This is one of the all time best riffs ever, very few players will ever create something so amazingas this. The use of the choir in the end is genius and really makes the song twice as good as it would be with out it. Truly a classic. `Naked In The Rain' is a cool song, but it kind of reminds me of `Suck My Kiss' but it is still a really good song. `Apache Ros Peacock' is a strange song about New Orleans, its really a nice song with some great backing and group vocals. `The Greeting Song' is a great high energy fast paste song with loads of great guitar. It doesn't really stand out along with the rest of the album but the bass is some of Flea's all time best playing that is for sure. `My Lovely Man' is another great song and it really sounds like nothing the band has ever recorded before. Im not really sure how to describe it but it is a really good song with nice guitar playing, it really stands out. Ok, um.. `Sir Psycho Sexy' is one of the dirtiest songs ever. Someone was horny when they wrote the song, very sexual charge. It is a fun song to listen to and don't let the length worry you the song never gets boring it only gets better as the song goes along. The album closes with Robert Johnson cover, yes I said Robert Johnson the king of the Delta Blues. I really don't like it but I think they just did it for fun.<br /><br />So in the end this really is the best thing they boys have ever done. I think the Red Hot Chili Peppers will make a better album then this some day but for now this is the best place for people to start with the band so don't hesitate order now!ing as this.

B000002LQR|5.0|There's not much more I can about how truly great this album is. Like so many other people, it really changed me and helped shape my musical outlook from 1991 when it originally came out to the present.<br /><br />But the reason why I'm posting a review is to express my disdain that WB hasn't seen fit to remaster this extraordinary CD.<br /><br />The mix and everything is fine, but the volume levels are too low on the current CD. I know that their EMI back catalog all got the remastering treatment, so why hasn't WB done it to this majestic album.<br /><br />They remastered the few tracks off of this album that they put on the recent greatest hits, so why not the entire album?<br /><br />Oh, and as a bass player of about 16 years, this album pretty much changed my bass playing outlook like a lot of other fellow low end fiends.
B000E97HIA|4.0|If you're expecting or wishing that Prince would stick to one style, you're very likely to be disappointed.  I've always pretty much liked Prince ever since I was about 9 or 10 years old.  Some of the songs he's composed weren't really to my liking, but because the world revolves around no one person, you're not going to be happy all the time with everything one particular person does.  Even though I may have not liked each song Prince has put out there, I respect him as an artist and a person willing to take chances with different sounds and he's one of the few artists around who consistently produces albums that are very good as a whole - there are plenty of performers out there that put out a CD with a couple of good songs, and then fill the rest with idiotic skits and filler crap.  Prince is one of the few artists that I know that I can purchase an album and be exposed to something unique and different in every song, and genuinely enjoy most of them. <br /> <br />I think a lot of people that grew up when I did, children of the 70's, teens of the 80's and 20-somethings of the 90's, look and listen to recent Prince albums and expect that it will be just like 1999 or Purple Rain, which I believe are the albums that are most associated with Prince, I think when you mention his name, most people's first thoughts will go to something on one of those albums or in the film Purple Rain.  But you have to think back.  Most of the albums released by Prince at the time of their release contained sounds that were a lot different that what was out there on the radio and on the Top 40 at that same time.  Prince has definitely had his share of songs that were considered popular, but a lot of his stuff was simply his own, and even the ones that made it to the charts stood out from the songs that shared the chart with them.   <br /> <br />I don't think it's fair to compare Beck and Prince, but I think they are both very talented individuals who live to express themselves from music, that they have had the spotlight on them at one time, but that are probably generally more concerned with their art than their popularity.   <br /> <br />And while I realize this is a biased statement, I don't believe it is at all accurate to say that Britney, Jessica, and Justin (among others) are more talented than Prince.  I don't really see their music, while I can see they do posess talent, as more than just this churned out industrial mindless crap that is force-fed to kids; of course, similar statements were likely said about Prince in the 1980's.  They have not yet stood the test of time, Prince has, and most everything I have heard from these persons sounds pretty much the same.  We will see.  But that's just me, a crusty old, close to 40 guy that just doesn't listen to popular radio.  Thank God for XM and iPods.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|after 4 looong years the peppers came out with a new album and they make up for it with a double!! i was wondering if they were ever gonna make one and lo and behold there it is.  the first disc (Jupiter) is more catchy than the second disc (Mars).  The first disc is more catchy fun rock, and the second is more... well i guess experimental??  this is the part where the peppers mean by \\"flying high above earth\\".  its something to seriously listen to and chill and let it take u away.  instant favorites of mine on here are \\"dani california\\", \\"especially in michigan\\", \\"charlie\\" (awesome chorus on that one!!)\\"Stadium arcadium\\", \\"slow cheetah\\", \\"c'mon girl\\" (awesome bass line) \\"readymade\\" (awesome bass intro) and the beach feel of \\"animal bar\\".  most of these songs are very instrument based whee the lyrics are based off of them and not the instruments around the music.  If u like any pepper music, buy this and you wony be disappointed
B00005JOYA|5.0|I thought this film was really good and really well done compared to other videogame based movies. I thought it maintained a lot of the elements from the games and a lot of the original plot elements were kept. I just wish it had been a little bit scarrier but it still gets the job done. I'm so glad that Uwe Boll didn't get his hands on this because I know he would have butchered it. Big thumbs up on this movie.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Stadium Arcadium-Red Hot Chili Peppers *****<br /><br />To begin words cant even attempt to explain how amazing this album is. Stadium Arcadium is without a doubt the best Red Hot Chili Peppers album ever. I  had this album for a week before it was released because of a record shop owner I know so I have had time to digest it. I heard rumors that this was not going to be very good and just another album but it is so much more. With every listen I grow founder of the album. 28 tracks and not a single bad one, what are the chances of that? This maybe the very best double album ever, yes better then Physical Graffiti, The White Album, well maybe London Calling is better. The band really worked hard on this record and it shows. Anthony Keidis' lyrics, vocals and performance is just brilliant. Chad Smith's drumming is maybe the best it has ever been. Flea is playing the best he has in almost 15 years. John Frushanti is at an all time best here I am simply blown away by how this man gets better with every album and his performance here is that of legend. He said his inspirations for the album were Jimi Hendrix which you can clearly hear and finding faith which is cool itself.<br /><br />Disc one is clearly the better disc not to say two is bad it's just this side is even more amazing. The album opens up with `Dani California' which in my honest opinion is one of the very best songs the band has ever made. The lyrics are becoming an all time favorite and the guitar solo is so simple and yet one of the coolest I think I have ever heard. `Snow (Hey Oh)' is a great song with a nice melody and a killer guitar riff. To me the first two songs here the two best they really set the pace for the rest of the album. The title track `Stadium Arcadium' `Especially In Michigan' `Slow Chetah' `Warlocks' and `Charlie' are the stand out tracks on the first disc but all of the songs are good and are unique and really make this an interesting album that I don't think will ever get old.<br /><br />Disc two is slightly more mellow but still very good. A few instances moments balance this side of the album perfectly. This side opens with `Desecration Smile' which is slower and really sets the pace for the rest of this disc. Once again the musicianship is amazing and so are the lyrics and the over all performance. And once again all the songs are amazing but `If' `Animal Bar' `21st Century' `Hard To Concentrate' `Storm In A Teacup' and `Tell Me Baby' are the stand out tracks.<br /><br />Stadium Arcadium is really and album unlike any I have ever heard. I have never heard an album so clear where everything flows so perfectly with no bumps in the road. Unlike other albums where the band has followed a specific pattern or theme this one does not. Where By The Way was more laid back, BloodSugarSexMagik was more intense, and Mothers Milk was more funky this is an album that blends everything everyone loves about Red Hot Chili Peppers into one album. Easily going to be a classic and one I will recommend to anyone anywhere. Truly a masterpiece and easily the best album to come along in many, many years. Can't wait for the tour.br /> <br />Disc two is slightly more mellow but still very good. A few instances moments balance this side of the album perfectly.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Double albums can be tricky endeavors. Most of them could have easily been whittled down to a single great album (The Clash's \\"Sandinista\\" for example) while other double albums wouldn't be the same if a single track was removed.<br /><br />Stadium Arcadium falls in the latter category.<br /><br />I've been a Peppers fan ever since I first got to hear the Uplift Mofo Party Plan CD and I've been hooked ever since. The only release that I don't care for at all out of their entire catalog was 1995's One Hot Minute, which suffered greatly from one time guitarist Dave Navarro ruining their overall sound (not to mention the songs were awful for the most part).<br /><br />Some people have seriously complained about the more mellow direction that the Peppers have gone in starting with 1999's Californication (which was the return to the fold of guitarist John Frusciante).  People forget that now, these guys are in their mid 40's for the most part.  If you want to hear the in your face youthful aggression of their earlier stuff, then just go back and listen to their earlier stuff. Quit complaining that their new stuff isn't Blood Sugar Sex Magik 2.<br /><br />I'm 31 years old now and in a much, much different place than I was 15 years ago. I'm sure the same is for the Peppers as whole as well. I have found that the Pepper's change in direction to a certain extent over the last couple of albums mirrors my life as I've gotten older.<br /><br />But Stadium Arcadium is kind of a kick in the pants with some tracks harkening back to their older style of music. There's other stuff that is more in the laid back mode of 2002's By The Way, but it still has a bit more vibrancy than the stuff on that otherwise great release did.<br /><br />Cd #1 is a little over 62 minutes in length while CD #2 is just a few seconds shy of topping out at exactly an hour in length.<br /><br />That's a lot of music to digest. But the smorgasbord of styles they gallop through on this release makes this one of the best CD's in quite some time to just sit back, chill out and let the sounds envelop you.<br /><br />Some might argue that this release could have been paired down to a single CD of material, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Every song is a gem.<br /><br />Is this as great of a release as Blood Sugar Sex Magik is? Only time will tell, but I can say that it's their best release since that monumental 1991 classic.ill out and let the sounds envelop you.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am a Tool \\"fan\\" and not a \\"fanatic\\". I only rediscovered them in between the release of Lateralus and 10000 days when the Tool \\"hype\\" was at its zenith (I always ignored them years earlier when they were the toast of the town). Now I regret not discovering them earlier. Like all Tool albums Maynard's lyrics on 10000 days touch me emotionally especially \\"Jambi\\" and \\"Wings\\" Part 1 and 2. I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that I prefer the newer, softer style they are evolving into. If I need my fix of heavier music I look elsewhere. All in all this is an excellent introspective album that will enlighten you if you give it half a chance. Buy it.
B000EULJLU|2.0|Look.  Maynard wants you to know he's a genius.  That's great.  I'm all for an educated band.  I am admittedly an old school metalhead, more prone to SOD than Dream Theater.  But really, enough.  I have been a Tool fan since Opiate.  And as they go more prog, I get more bored.  This may be a great album for you if you want ambiance.  But I know these guys are capable of rocking the f--- out.  They have apparently just outgrown it.  Maybe I'm clinging too hard to my youth, but... just... so... boring... now...  2 minute intro, 58 seconds of song, 2 and a half minutes of signature Tool three note baseline, 1 minute of song, scream scream scream back to baseline...  And reviewers above me?  What's this about?  I truly respect intelligently laid out reviews, but repeatedly saying \\"I couldn't take it the first 15 times I heard it so I gave it 4 to 5 out of 5 stars.\\"  What?  Guys, it's okay to say you didn't care for it.  Maynard would have us believe he is much too intelligent and evolved to be hurt by this...  I give this two stars.  I won't claim it's a bad album, but I will tell anyone who likes the thrash inspired version of Tool to move along, there is nothing to see here.
B00004WGBE|5.0|I love period piece classics and this is by far one of my favorites.  I have read the book and though there are several differences, by whole the movie brought the book to life in a wonderful way.  I rate a movie how it draws you in, and this one had me hooked right away.
0451526279|5.0|The present novel is about the young women, Emma Woodhouse, who lives a pampered life with her father in Sussex. The family is well off financially and one of the wealthiest in Hartfield, part of Highbury. Her mother has passed away and her sister has married and left the home. Emma's governess, who is her best friend as well, has gone leaving Emma alone with her father. The story revolves around Emma's social life in the town and the development of Emma as a person. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.<br /><br />I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.<br /><br />Based on the four novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.<br /><br />Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.<br /><br />From what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.<br /><br />Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.<br /><br />This was written by a mature Jane Austen and by way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" The read is slow and a bit diffuse since there is no clear set of protagonists other than Emma, her brother-in-law, her reserved father and a few other residents of the town. The novel wanders for 350 pages, then comes together strongly at the end. Overall, it is a delightful and a pleasant read.ry of Cowper.

B000EMGAOY|4.0|You can look at this album in many ways -- the best they ever done, they best since this certain album, their worst album and so on.  <br /> <br />I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon of praises, neither am I going to throw this album under the bus. <br /> <br />I'm going to be honest. I don't really like the album. It's not garbage, it's still a good album, but the feel of it is rather alienating. Now, albeit it would be really stupid of me to think that four men, after years and years of maturity, would go back to their raunchiness of their older days, but I didn't think they would really channel into one album everything they have done (which is not a bad thing) into something that has more pop sensibility (which turned me off about the album). <br /> <br />As for the album itself, it features Flea more melodic, and a return to form in terms of gritty and groovy bass lines, but a bit more subdued; John Frusciante incorporates more rhythm guitar in addition to his trademark melodies, and he adds a certain Jimi Hendrix/Jimmy Page-esque virtuousity to it which brings about impressive solos; Chad Smith's drumming is a constant strong point and a display that he -- along with Stephen Perkins -- are amongst the best drummers of the past twenty five years; and Anthony Kiedis' vocals (at times too professional) is peaking. <br /> <br />The funk is back -- from dirty and gritty such as the \\"Charlie\\", \\"She's Only 18\\", and \\"Hump De Bump\\" to the more subdued funk of Californication to the present such as \\"21st Century\\", \\"Tell Me Baby\\", and \\"Dani California\\" and the heavier, more metal influenced material such as \\"Readymade\\" and \\"Storm In A Teacup\\". The majority of the album  stays with a late 60s early 70s feel of melodies, moodiness, and psychedelia, which was prominent on By The Way and Californication. <br /> <br />However, like I said, I don't like the album. I respect the album, but I don't necessarily like it. It is the feel of the album that has pushed me away fromit as a whole. However I will say the following: if you are a fan of the Peppers work of say, the past 7 years beginning with Californication, then I think you'll find enjoyment with this record; however, if you are a bigger fan of their older days and not too fond of their work after say Blood Sugar Sex Magik and One Hot Minute, then you might not think too highly of this record.
B000000OR9|3.0|Another CD title I haven't heard in quite sometime. First came out in 1989, as for some reason outside the two tracks \\"Jelly Roll\\" and the full throttled rocker \\"Valley Of The Kings\\", this album never did all that much for me. Some described it as heavy blues-like rock. I sort of thought of Blue Murder as like a hair band super-group, because of it's line-up, which was: John Sykes (Whitesnake / Thin Lizzy) - guitar & vocals, Tony Franklin (The Firm) - bass and Carmine Appice (Vanilla Fudge, Cactus) - drums. As an entire CD's worth of music, 'Blue Murder' barely makes the grade. Last I heard from Sykes was, when he was in a current 'line-up' of Thin Lizzy, touring with Deep Purple a few summers back. Actually, Sykes did a decent job of carrying on in the late Phil Lynott's spot. Before purchasing this CD, I highly recommend that you listen to sound clips first.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This has to be by far my favorite movie I have seen yet.  I watched it and couldn't get enough of the movie that I ordered the book.  The book does differ, but I prefer the movie ending over the books.  I thought that Daniela Denby-Ashe portrayed her character Margaret beautifully.  And Richard Armitage, well he was everything that I would want as a leading man, (except for the temper).  I want to be Margaret!  What really made this movie top rate to me is the historical plot.  It wasn't all about the rich and luxurious life styles that are usually played out, but of the life of a common industrial city back in the 19th Century.  My husband who hates my chick flicks really enjoyed this movie and its accurate portrayl of that time and has watched more than once with me.
B000EULJLU|5.0|For anyone who is a TRUE TOOL fan going back to the early to mid 90's, you are selfish to think that the whole album is going to be hard.  TOOL has evolved over the years into something that doesn't sound like any other band.  Fred Durst (what ever happened to him?) from Limp Bizkit once said it after Lateralus came out, \\"this band is way ahead of what kind of sound to produce that will keep people interested and listening).  Is it a wonder why they have sold over 10 million albums in the U.S.? I got chills listening to the 4th track as it is a continuation of the 3rd one.  The sheer beauty of this band is that they come out with an album every 5 years as it seems these days, and if you can't appreciate it for what it is, then don't be a TOOL fan.  This album has a good mix that is hard and soft. If you guys don't get it....thats what makes a good band....they can write soft stuff and hard stuff and still have people who are into it.  Don't you guys get it?  I seen TOOL at MSG 2 weeks after 9/11 and they rocked then even though NYC was cautious who they looked in the eye after what happened to our country, and this band brought a somber crowd out of the seats and rocked the Garden back then, and they still rock. If you don't see that, then you really don't appreciate music for what it is.  This album rocks, and you guys are a bunch of jokers if you are disappointed.<br /><br />-Jeff<br /><br />New Jersey
0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi is excruciatingly detailed.  I thought about stopping several times but in the end I was glad I did not.  The ending is very thought provoking.  Laborious Journey Great Ending.
B00000JS1M|5.0|Originally released in 1983, as 'Power & The Glory' was Saxon's sixth lp. No idea as to why there are several one-star reviews here by others. I remember this record being considered to be somewhat of an under rated classic back in the day when 'metal DID more or less rule'. Noticed that drummer Nigel Glockler had just joined the band. Tunes that I truly miss hearing on a semi-regular basis are the powerful title track \\"Power&The Glory\\" (VH1 Classic should play that video sometime), their anthem (sort of) \\"This Town Rocks\\", \\"Watching The Sky\\" and \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\". Prime '80's top of the line British metal to be had here. Highly recommended.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I think the movie was a good representation of what the crusaders were actually like, and it was a refreshing difference from the stereotypical depictions of Arabs and Muslims as demon spawn and evil incarnate. Yes, the crusaders did commit crimes of genocide; yes, the crusades were instigated on purposes of greediness and opportunistic exploitation of Arab dissention at the time; and yes, the Arabs were for the most part extremely tolerant to the European invaders, even though the \\"noble\\" knights pillaged, raped, and left bloodbaths on their merry way to \\"free\\" Jerusalem from the \\"radical\\" Muslims. I think these reviews show how revisionists are working these days, they start by accusing well-meaning directors of their own crimes, much like KG children steal a chocolate bar and claim the rightful owner is the thief! Extremely pathetic and completely childish and ludicrous. The movie was a realistic representation of what the Church was commiting at that time period, christian apologetics are claiming that the movie is a blatant attack on Catholicism. Didn't the Pope stand on a podium, raise a crimson cross and announce a crusade, one that lasted two centuries and caused tens of thousands of innocent Muslim lives, many of whom were women and children? I'm not sure how Ridley Scott could've put that in a positive light. The movie is for the most part accurate, Scott didn't pull any punches for the sake of Christian feelings, if you want a movie about how the chain-mailed hordes with the angry red crosses around their necks killing and raping as they press on to satisfy their pockets as saintly, pious, gracious, anointed heroes who protected their christian brethren (which is false, any historian worth his pay would tell that Arab christians fought alongside Arab Muslims in driving the European threat off the Arab lands) then I would suggest you look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Also, to my knowledge, in 683 AD the archbishop of al-Quods(Jerusalem) asked for Omar al-Khatab, and after the Caliph's arrival, the archbishop presented the keys of the city to him. There was no sack of the city whatsoever, furthermore Omar refused to pray in one of the churches when the archbishop invited him to, but he prayed outside it, because he was afraid that Muslims might turn the church into a mosque. Obviously the reviewer with the love of the thesaurus seems he got all his info wrong, that's what you get for reading an ignorant, hateful man's rant(Jon Spencer) about a religion he doesn't understand. The movie was a fair depiction, definately not Hollywood empty fodder like some of these angry Christian reviewers make it out to be.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Don't be fooled by a wave of Tool fans who would lay out their last dollar just to hear Maynard sing anything because \\"10,000 Days\\" by Tool is their worst album to date.  And, yes, I am aware that, when considering Tool's total production and how bad most music currently is, a bad Tool album is still better than 75% of the music on the radio.  However, this belief does not excuse a band when they produce inferior work.    It seems like forever since \\"Opiate\\" was released way back in 1992.  But it's live energy and its premonition like sense that the band was going to leave a mark, was difficult to ignore- Rating of an 8 out of 10.    Then, like a slam against the head, \\"Undertow\\" came and brought the band out of LA and onto MTV with its videos of \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex.\\"  Unlike the concept album approach that \\"Aenima\\" would have later, \\"Undertow\\" simply rocks with what would seem almost impossible: Long songs with subdued meanings- Rating of 10 out of 10.    \\"Aenima\\" in 1996 was this band's \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Zeppelin 4.\\"  Like \\"The Wall,\\" \\"Aenima\\" had a continous sound, although a looser theme.  Grabbing the listener's attention from the opening riff of \\"Stinkfist\\" and taking them on a ride through the destruction of LA, \\"Aenima\\" was what Tool was meant to represent: A band who didn't leave anything behind in the studio- Rating of 10 out of 10.    However, like they say, all good things must come to an end.  \\"Lateralus\\" was the first sign of Tool beginning to lose their way.  Concentrating too much on operatic backgrounds and falling in love with airy, synthesizer-like effects, the band only goes up-tempo for \\"Schism\\" and \\"Ticks and Leeches.\\"  When Maynard screams in the latter song, \\"Is this what you wanted, is this what you had in mind?\\" I did my best to scream back, \\"Yes, and don't you forget it!\\"  But, he wasn't listening-Rating of 7 out of 10.    Now, after five years of waiting, the band has released a bloated, 75 minute long opus entitled \\"10,000 Days.\\"  Its first single \\"Vicarious\\" comes close to the same sound of their \\"Lateralus\\" single, \\"Schism;\\" thereby suggesting that the band may have run out of new ideas.      For most of \\"10,000 Days,\\" there is a Gregorian Monk quality to it of chants and windchimes.  Which is hardly what I want to hear when I play a Tool CD.  Also, most of the songs are predictable, beginning softly to a restrained crescendo.  I say 'restrained' because there is the feeling that the band is holding back and worrying more about song structure than destroying the eardrums of its fans.  Well, I'm sorry, but I want Tool to make my eardrums to bleed like they did after listening to \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Aenima.\\"    Also, nearly absent from the whole album, is Maynard himself.  Sure he sings on nearly every song, but he doesn't sing on every song.  Real Tool fans will know what I mean- Rating of 6 out of 10.    I don't know if this will be Tool's last record, although I have a feeling it will be when considering the length of time between their prior albums.  If it is, I will still look back at the band as one of my all time favorites, right up there with Zeppelin, Floyd, and AIC.  Maybe I was hoping for too much in wanting them to go out with a bang instead of a whimper.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|At first glance I found it easy to agree with the common opinion; Stadium Arcadium seemed to have marginal portions of filler and was too long, although after numerous listens, each song emerges with it's own unique characteristics and establishes itself as a nessisary entity in a musical mosaic. <br /> <br />The album is full of carefree funk gems like Hump De Bump, Warlocks, 21st Century and Storm In A Teacup that are reminiscent but exist without being derivative of the former Chili Peppers success. <br /> <br />The tender moments are the most glorious and profound of the Chili's career like Slow Cheetah, Desecration Smile and She Looks To Me. They all carry a beautiful sophisticated air that is veritably matchless. <br /> <br />The Peppers take no drastic risks with this album, but it remains unconfused, and if Stadium Arcadium tracks were shuffled in with Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californication and By The Way tracks, they would be easily distinguished by a listener without previous knowledge of any of the Chili's discography. What I equate this to, is that there are thousands of ways to prepare, cook and present salmon, rice, fish eggs and seaweed, but there remains an ultimate refined presentation of these ingredients; sushi. The Chili Peppers bring peerless presence to the mix and have arranged and presented themselves in the most refined and polished way to date. This album is Anthony Kedis, Flea, John Frusciante and Chad Smith at their ultimate career pinnacle.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Judas Priest was a bit before my time, as I didn't really get into \\"metal\\" until the late '80s with Metallica, Anthrax, and Megadeth. Recently I acquired the \\"Metalogy\\" four disc set by Judas Priest and was immediately blown away by the disc that spanned \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" and \\"Defenders of the Faith.\\" <br /> <br />Yesterday I bought \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" even though the majority of the songs are on the \\"Metalogy\\" disc set. I had to. Man, that CD is just brutal (in a good way). Halfords vocals sound his strongest to me during this period and the music is almost flawless. I'm kind of sad I didn't discover this album when I was younger because it would have been a great album to puke-and-rally to. <br /> <br />If you consider yourself a \\"metal\\" fan, you need to own this CD. I can't think of anything out at that time that even touches it. <br /> <br />I've exceeded my use of quotation marks for one review. <br /> <br />~Slick
B00004RF83|5.0|A well written and well casted political thriller drama.  The characters are quite believable.  The tension gets so thick you can cut it with a knife.  At issue is the attempted takeover of the government by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs fo Staff.  The motivation of these characters is not personal glorification, but loyalty and patriotism.  This movie has philosophical weightiness to it but does not beat you over the head with it.
B00003CWN3|5.0|I found no flaws in the telling of the story of Teena Brandon in this film. I have read the tragic true life reports that, unfortunately lack the most insightful words of Teena herself, and I am amazed at how this film gives an honest, respectful portrayal of a human in pain who is making the most of her troubled life. I was moved, hurt and troubled myself about Teena's plight. The film does not exploit her difficulties, but fairly and delicately present a person, not an oddity. Hilary Swank transforms herself in this film perfectly, convincingly expressing the awkward efforts of a woman to fit into her psyche. The entire cast gives an outstanding performance. As a piece of theatrical art, this is definitely a gem, even though it is disturbing and tragic, especially because the facts it relays are true.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|I was fortunate enough to listen to this album in it's entirety on VH1.com on Monday 5/8/06.  After a couple of plays, I came to the conclusion that I would do myself a favor and save the twelve bucks that I would have dropped at Best Buy to buy this the next day.  This is without a doubt the boringest, dullest, and just down right dreadful music the RHCPs have ever released.  Dani California is an awesome track, however it's a yawn-fest the next 27 tracks.  It's like listening to Porcelin (from Californication) style tracks the next 2 hours. You will regret buying this if you are expecting the RHCP to rock, they have just sunk way down into the mellow out mode, with Anthony Keidis just Crooning his way through 27 songs Clay Aiken style.  How can you rate this 5 stars along the lines of Blood Sugar Sex Magik?  Buyer and fan beware.
0553584537|3.0|This was my first Lisa Gardner, and while I do plan to check out The Perfect Husband, this book (Alone) left me forcing myself to try to finish it. I gave it three stars, however, for the following reasons: <br /> <br />Police sniper Bobby Dodge is a character with depth and street smarts. Catherine Gagnon has dark, hidden depths to her soul. And the chemistry between the two - intensified by Dodge's inability to see the truth in her eyes - was simply stunning. <br /> <br />This book was well-written, the plot was intricate, but for some reason, I simply could not get into it. I skipped some and went to the end to see if my suspicions were correct, then put it down for something else. <br /> <br />I'm not sure why I wasn't taken with Alone. There are so many positives to this novel, I'm surprised it didn't suck me right in and leave me breathless. Instead, it left my mind wandering. <br /> <br />If you get it, try it used and see if it's your style.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|This is a fun movie.  Is it true to the Cussler Saga?  No is the simple answer.  That does not detract from the fun of this film.  The cast enjoyed themselves in this work or so it appeared.  The main characters do not resemble the written characters whatsoever.  This is still a far superior effort than \\"Raise the Titanic\\" from some years ago.  Read the book, watch the movie.  Enjoy both for what they have to offer.
0783225849|5.0|Seldom will you find horror, suspense and psychological thrills so skillfully done as you will with Psycho. This film is definitely on top of horror hill. Without the gore of modern flicks, it creeps you out like no other film. With only a handful of actors, the movie will hold your attention, make you squirm and make you think ahead with hope and fearful expectation. The best film of its kind. If you want to be scared, watch and be terrified.
B000002U82|5.0|The dark side of the moon is the greatest album of all time.I am surprised that The wall has outsold it even though it is a great album in it's own right.Please listen to songs like Money,Breathe and Time to be convinced that there will never be another album as great as this one.Recommended.
B00004Y6NM|3.0|I remember the buzz surrounding this album back in the mid-80's touting that \\"Eric Clapton is back!\\" There were full page ads in the music magazines at the time, mixed between articles on Ratt's new album, and whether or not David Lee Roth would be leaving Van Halen. Where did Eric Clapton fit into the scheme of things back in 1985?<br /><br />The musical climate had changed dramatically from when he had topped the charts in the '70's, and his two new 80's albums (\\"Money and Cigarettes\\" and \\"Another Ticket\\") made nary a whimper. So to help give him some direction, Clapton enlisted the help of Phil Collins, who could do no wrong at the time on the music charts. So that's why this album is so heavy on the slick 80's production and Phil Collins drum sound. Let's face it, back when this was released, the slick 80's sound wasn't a bad thing!<br /><br />The painfully obvious thing about this album is that it is indeed a transition album, showing an artist trying to acclimate to a new sound. One half of the album is very pop sounding (\\"She's Waiting,\\" \\"Forever Man,\\" \\"Never Make You Cry\\"), while the other half is still in '70's mode (\\"Knock on Wood,\\" \\"Same Old Blues,\\" \\"Something's Happening\\"). It never quite works and seems somewhat awkward at times. Yet when he shines, she shines brightly. \\"Forever Man\\" and \\"She's Waiting\\" proved to be the biggest hits off the album, showing that Clapton was still relevant in the 80's.<br /><br />My favorite track is actually one of the sleeper songs on the album, a beautiful little tune called \\"Never Make You Cry.\\" It's easy to dismiss as sticky-sweet fluff, but there's just something about it that puts it up there with \\"Wonderful Tonight.\\" Not in the same league, but definitely up there.
B000002IM7|5.0|When I first saw \\"King\\" on MTV I fell in love with the powerful groove of the band that in the coming years I would come to love more than any other.  I instantly relished the opportunity to turn on some of my friends to them, who would also become devoted fans.  The music was like nothing I had ever heard before and, despite the influence they have had on the world of hard rock, like nothing I have heard since.  The first sign of their uniqueness is their use of drop-D tuning.  The added crunch was important to give impetous to their grooves, but unlike most who have used this tuning since, power was not the only thing it added.  It gave Ty Tabor the ability to create chordal structures that were truly groundbreaking, making his guitar one of the most unique instruments in rock music.  The arrangements as a result were intricate, but the boys made it all fit into the overall structure of the song; the chords fit just right.  Doug Pinnick's voice is the heart of the band and on 'Planet' he sings with a gravity that touches your soul but with a freedom that takes you away.  The harmonies are unlike any other hard rock band (the only comparison I have ever come up with is CSN).  Finally, the songwriting and lyrical content are amazing.  The songs have solid grooves with powerful chord progressions and melodies that are memorable but inventive.  The lyrics are more intelligent and positive than any other metal band and probably were the main reason they never got off the ground.  They sang about spirituality and real issues in an age where blatant sexual references and satanic posing were the tickets to success.  'In the New Age' begins the album with a strong statement about pseudo-spirituality with a muscular melody playing against snaking guitar lines and almost spooky backing vocals.  Goldilox is a love song, one of a very few King's X love songs, of haunting beauty.  Then comes three songs that I always take as a set in my mind.  'Power of Love', 'Wonder' and 'Sometimes' are songs of spiritual longing that can make your heart break but since they are so smartly crafted they have are totally devoid of sappy sentimentality.  'Power of Love' is as the title suggests a 'powerful' ode to the meaning of love and one of my all-time favorite songs.  'Wonder' is a song about the band's struggle with how their spirituality fits in to their music and their everyday lives. Then 'Sometimes' comes back with the confidence that their faith finally brings them.  'King' is a song with a groove as big as Mack truck and just as heavy, yet, it is a song of hope for justice.  'What is This?' is an example of how exceptional King's X are at weaving a sound picture.  The verses admit the confussion and doubt that a life of faith brings to one in a world that rejects people who are different and the swirling, lurching guitar reflects it.  But, then the power of the chorus again brings home the reassurance that faith can still be.  'Far, Far Away' is overshadowed by the other songs on the record but its still a very good one--there simply is not a bad song here.  'Shot of Love', the second single, is probably the best song on the album but shows why they couldn't get very far.  How does a record company market a band whose best song references holy communion but shuns the label Christian?  Finally, the lyric \\"The lunatic says goodbye to those who say they love him\\" from the final cut, 'Visions' is an example of just how different King's X is. Most of the song is a durge that depicts the slow confusion of insanity--which Doug admits he feels sometimes--but then kicks into frantic crazyness that when played live leaves one floored by the band's tightness and control within a seemingly chaotic arrangement.  From top to bottom 'Out of the Silent Planet' is as perfect as you can get.  The only possible problem with it is that the sound isn't as polished as it could be, but that was never Producer Sam Taylor's intention anyway.  Polish would have gotten in the way of the emotion.  This is a band that could make you think and feel, a very rare thing.  Though FHL would be their most ambitious album and Dogman would be their most powerful album, this was their most consistanly brilliant album.  This one goes to 11.
B00005JNQA|4.0|The actors selected for this film and the excellent writing, directing, editing and plot development make this flick a great choice for those who enjoy both action and intrigue. Major plot avenues are fully travelled and definition and complete attention are still given to fine details. Character development, coupled with suspense, make the film and edge-of-your seat experience. If you enjoy films like The Bourne Identity and The Firm, you will definitely like this movie.
B000062TU1|5.0|Oh thank goodness I wasn't the only one who noticed missing scenes!  Like another reviewer, I too saw the ABC Family showing last December (and taped it on my DVR). So when I finally borke down and got the box-set last month, I was shocked that these important scenes were missing! Granted they are in the extra-dvd, but certainly would have been best to keep them in. This was also true for Chamber of Secrets (deleted scenes on extra dvd). Still, as a devoted 40-something fan of all that is HP, I would still recommend the movies (Azcaban is the best in the series of the films). Will be sad when the last book comes out...sigh...
B00004Y6NK|4.0|I have all of Eric Clapton's albums, including stuff from his Cream, Blind Faith, and Derek & the Dominoes days, and I have to say \\"August,\\" \\"Behind the Sun,\\" and \\"Journeyman\\" are the three albums of his I tend to come back to most. \\"August\\" is second only to \\"Journeyman\\" as the most enjoyable of the three.<br /><br />I've seen many complaints about Phil Collins's bad influence (pun intended) on the album, but it really doesn't phase me, as I enjoyed \\"Behind the Sun.\\" The album was released in '86, but the only song that sounds dated to me is the duo with Tina Turner,\\"Tearing Us Apart.\\" But songs like \\"It's in the Way that You Use it,\\" \\"Run,\\" \\"Holy Mother,\\" and \\"Miss You,\\" stand out as some of my favorites.<br /><br />If I recall, \\"Behind the Sun\\" (the album before \\"August\\") was hailed as somewhat of a comeback album, giving Clapton more of a commercial appeal, and putting him back in the public eye. \\"August\\" just extended the winning streak with the hit theme song from \\"The Color of Money\\" -- \\"It's in the Way That You Use it\\" -- as well as his reworking of \\"After Midnight\\" for a beer commercial (was that for Miller Lite?). And he looked every inch the suave guitar god -- styled hair, trimmed beard, and a good fashion sense. Best of all, he seemed to be having fun on stage again, helping to bring this material, as well as his older stuff, to life.<br /><br />So while \\"August\\" isn't \\"Slowhand\\" or \\"461 Ocean Boulevard,\\" it's a nice Clapton 80's time capsule, showing an artist that hit his stride after reinventing himself for a new decade of success.
B000E41MS6|4.0|I loved watch this series last year and it finaly come to the US on sci fi (but better late then never) I love to get the offical DVD I already got all of season one recorded on DVD from the TV so I can not justify the price(the only reason I did give it 5 stars <br />one note season 2 started a bit slow but girl in the fireplace comfermed the seson season a true hit
B0001NBMBC|1.0|You dissed yourself by saying you cant even imitate the complex sound of slipknot. LOL !! They have no talent! Kerry King could play at slipknots level when he was like 4 years old. For a band with 9 members you would think that they would be complex. Instead it sounds like crap. <br />If you are a slipknot fan reconsidering your bad taste in metal I suggest you try the following bands. Slayer, Opeth, Dimmu Borgir, Arch Enemy, Old Mans Child and Burzum.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|This new double cd from the peppers is just ok...it isnt great but it isnt bad. there are some good songs and there are some crappy ones. To me  \\"By The Way\\" is above and beyond better than this collection of tunes.........pick up PEARL JAM <br /> <br />thats an album!!!!!!!!
B00006EXL5|1.0|This has got to be one of the most musically-stunted bands i've ever heard!  In fact, the whole ridiculous EMO and NU-METAL genres and 'eras' did nothing whatsoever for rock music.  As i'm listening to this CD right now, I hear nothing but disjointed, simple power chords and juvenile screaming, that, in my day, would be considered pure noise.  MCR would have gotten pelted with tomatoes and booed off the stage!  Now I know why I found this CD used for 99 cents in the 'bargain bin'!  If anything, this band is proof that today's generation has lowered it's musical standards BIGTIME!  We must live in an age of diminished expectations, given the drivel kids listen to now.  The 'dumbing down of America' continues unabated...
B00005B36H|4.0|this album cannot be duplicated <br /> <br />10,000 days proves this theory!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Any new album of the Red Hot Chili Peppers is exiting news. Over the years they've shown they're capable of constantly renewing themselves and surprising you record after record with good songs and funky hooks. The Peppers are one of the few acts still around from the alternative revival at the end of the eighties and start of the nineties. So they've proven us enough they're here to stay. You might even call them the Rolling Stones of the alternative generation. This in itself is a small miracle seeing how their career developed. From the get go the Peppers were plagued by drugs and dying or changing band members. Yet in their present setting, with Frusciante back on board, the Peppers have been operating for the last ten years. So stability seems to have come to the band. The last ten years even found each individual member playing better. Both Flea's funk bombs and Frusciante's hooks have improved and Kiedis even learned how to sing. So why doesn't it get to me anymore?    In the days preceding the release of Stadium Arcedium MTV aired a career overview of the Peppers. The first half hour or so found me on my toes. I found my self exited to see those old images of the Chili Peppers, some almost twenty years back, it has really been that long. Even though the footage looks hopelessly dated by today's standards the band had a raw energy that was extremely appealing to the young teenager I was back then. The Peppers gradually progressed in their sound and song material as I grew older, seemingly growing with you. But when they started out they were an explosion of uninhibited sexual Funk/Punk power. I remembered feeling that \\"Fight Like a Brave\\" could have been written as a personal anthem for kids like me, remember feeling part of a generation while doing silly dances on \\"Freaky Styley\\", I remember my amazement when they released their masterpiece \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic\\", we talked about it for months. To sum it up, I noticed becoming melancholic while watchingMTV, realizing those days are really over.    So while this new Chili Peppers album truly is a strong effort, it will probably just disappear in my record collection again just as any other album they've did since that time. That has nothing to do with the wealth of the material that is here. I suspect Stadium Arcedium will appeal to a whole new generation of Peppers fans, although one could argue the album should have been condensed to a single disc. In all fairness they play their strengths like they do on any album, Kiedis is still committed to his songwriting, Flea and Frusciante are still churning out those great funky hooks, the ballads are moving as always, but I just rather remember the young punks they were back in the day. I'm getting older, sue me!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I am not sure about the reviewers who are looking for a \\"center piece\\".  Why does any CD need a \\"center piece\\" when all cuts are equally wonderful and different from the other cuts ?  Another point I would take issue with is that it does not take chances or never really breaks out.  What is wrong with these reviewers ? <br />The CD is a beautiful, melodic experience. Great harmonies, great arrangements.......I am not looking for psychic shock when I listen to music....If you are, go elsewhere.....This CD would rank up at the top along with Rosanne Cash's CD of 2006......
B000EULJLU|5.0|This like all tool albums takes quite a few listens to really take all in.  When i first got it I wasn't into it right away, but that wasn't any different than with aenima and lateralus.  After listening to it for a few days, and on a great system, it really hit me.  This album is right up their with aenima, if not better.  Tool really out did themselves with this one, but just remember it takes some listens to really appreciate.
1400079179|1.0|I read this book before it generated such publicity.  I had read Dan Brown's Angels & Demons, which I thought first rate.  A pluse pounding, heart racing thriller.  Because I enjoyed it so much, I purchased the Da Vinci Code.  What a let down!  It was no where near as well written or fast paced.  If you get a choice to choose between these two books, please choose Angels & Demons.  It is much better written.
B000002KHH|5.0|I will agree with heavymetalninja, yes, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin did create a foundation, but Black Sabbath made it called metal. Even today both of those bands are considered to be classic rock (who cares anyways about labeling?), but Sabbath will always be known as metal. This album helped pioneer metal into what is not only a huge genre, but is extremely important in today's world because it seems that the only musicians who could play pounding riffs with lightning speed and technicality anymore are those musicians who reside in metal. I think this is Black Sabbath's best album, with all the band members shining here. All the songs are great, with four of these contending for the best metal songs of all time. Black Sabbath is also the first band to actually be considered \\"evil\\" by many. Yes, Alice Cooper did the whole evil thing before hand, but that was shock-rock. Sabbath was no act. Also, Sabbath and their band members today both remain vital forces and influences in the genre they helped create. They also were one of the first to use the infamous down-tuned guitars to give the album a heavier feel. So, the point is if there was no Black Sabbath, then there wouldn't be anything, I suppose.    Black Sabbath has the classic line-up. With Tony Iommi on guitar, Terrance \\"Geezer\\" Butler on bass, Bill Ward on drums and the surreal John Michael \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne, now legendary, on vocals and lyrics. Tony Iommi, while not as good as his peers from the 60's and 70's, (but still great), was still able to write amazing and catchy riffs. Influenced by blues, jazz, and rock, Iommi wrote not only some of the haunting and chilling riffs ever recorded, and still cannot be bettered today. \\"Geezer\\" Butler is a great and underrated bassist, who also wrote most of the band's lyrics. He also thought of the name \\"Black Sabbath\\", and quickly converted from their old name, Earth. Bill Ward is an excellent drummer, with some catchy rhythms. And who could forget Ozzy? I could go on for years about him, but he was a true madman. He was no act. Just look at him now...he is completely burnt out. His drug abuse did not help his problems, which would later reflect to the controversy swirling around him. His vocals may not be great, but they are unique and fit perfectly with the dark, eerie music. Combine these guys together and you got Black Sabbath, or the foundation of metal.    This album, released in 1970 after the self-titled, has all the elements of a perfect album. Heavy riffs, light songs, powerful lyrics and great musicianship are all here, and expressed in every song. The album starts off with \\"War Pigs/Luke's Wall\\". The first half, the infamous War Pigs, is a protest to the Vietnam War and was supposed to be the title track. This has a great riff and very powerful and moving lyrics (which were recently ripped off by System of a Down in their chart-topping hit B.Y.O.B.) and I consider this to be Sabbath's best songs. The second half of it, \\"Luke's Wall\\", is the instrumental at the end, which is also very, very cool. \\"Paranoid\\" follows, and this is my favorite Black Sabbath song. Originally supposed to be filler, this song became a hit because of the great riff and lyrics. \\"Planet Caravan\\" is the famous slow, creepy song that is the perfect interlude to the next song. Caravan has been covered by many bands, and Ozzy's vocals shine. \\"Iron Man\\", considered by many the greatest metal song of all time, has a very simple, yet powerful riff that is known by everyone. The lyrics are about a guy who is paralyzed and ends the world. \\"Electric Funeral\\" is an underrated song not played on radio, and it has a cool intro and a nice riff. The lyrics are political again, this time pertaining to nuclear war.    The second half of this album starts off with \\"Hand Of Doom\\". This song is the first anti-heroin song by Black Sabbath, and the first of many by both the band and Ozzy Osbourne. Another underrated gem, I really like this one. I also like the transitions in this 7-minute long gem, apparently to represent shooting up the drug. Pretty creative, I might add. The instrumental, \\"Rat Salad\\", follows, and while I think this is filler, it is still a solid instrumental with a great drum solo in there from Bill Ward. The final masterpiece album closer, the epic \\"Jack The Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots\\", is actually not about what you think it is. Fairies Wear Boots is another epic from this album, and a fan favorite and included on almost every Sabbath compilation out there. They also play it live a lot. This caps off this monster of an album, which is still considered a classic by fans of many genre's alike. Their other 1970 release, the self-titled, is another great album that should be picked up. If you consider yourself to be a metalhead, then this is a law of the land. You should then look further into Black Sabbath, and I recommend the box set \\"Black Box: The Complete Original Black Sabbath\\", which is all the albums from the Ozzy Osbourne years. Even though all those albums are great, nothing matches to the first two. Classic!
B000002OZY|5.0|Pure Pete Townsend genius.  Overly analyzed.  If you don't get goose bumps from \\"....I get excitement at your feet.....\\", ice water runs through your veins.
0307277674|3.0|This mixed review comes because the book is well written and has plenty of suspense. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. But, unfortunately, Dan Brown thinks that his theories are somehow factual. Unfortunately for him, the fact is that the church had more issues in the first 3 centuries with Christ's humanity than his deity. Besides setting up the Council of Nicea in 325, there is no truth to the claim that Constantine had anything to do with creating Christ's deity or putting together the New Testament. In addition, Brown's theories that the NT is not trustworthy have no basis in fact. In fact, these errors make it hard to take this book seriously. Brown's lack of scholarly qualifications as well as his weak support and logical inconsistencies show that, while entertaining as fiction, the hype cannot be supported. Thus, I say, read the book for entertainment, but don't get caught up in its ridiculous claims. There are a number of good rebuttals against this book that show Dan Brown is no historian. Rather, fiction is his forte.
B000002UVZ|5.0|I hadn't listened to it in a while (a couple of years, probably) and got it out yesterday to listen to in my car. <br /> <br />I had forgotten just how brilliant this album is.  These songs, out of all their music, are the ones that sound best live. <br /> <br />No, it isn't \\"Murmur\\", their first full-length and best (IMHO) album, but it's wonderful from start to finish.
B00004WGYA|5.0|This album for me epitomised the 80's. Great catchy songs, overdosed with hits. This is the Duran's at their very best. Put on the white jacket, roll-up the sleeves, highlights in the hair and let the party begin.  A must-have classic album. Five stars is just not enough !!
B00070DK5K|4.0|Sure. The original release of this record wasn't the best it could have been but that was primarily because of technical reasons. Even the original liner notes acknowledge that there were overdubs. <br /> <br />If you were around when this record came out and by that I mean old enough to have been a fan , then you know that lots of Bowie supporters felt betrayed that the Spiders had been jettisoned in favor of a new band and approach. So they were opposed, in principle, to this record before it even hit the streets. But I didn't see it that way then. Sure. It didn't sound that great ,again from a technical point of view, and there were times when the juxtaposition of Earl Slick's guitars and Sanborn's sax didn't so great but the arrangements of these songs were superb.  <br /> <br />For example the version of Rock N' Roll suicide kicks total as$$ and blows the studio version away and I defy anyone to claim otherwise. The opener , 1984, is great the way it kicks in  ,and the horns make this tune as well as Herbie Flowers' bass lines (which are a total pleasure to listen to throughout the entire album). Width Of a Circle takes on a whole new air and completely exceeds the studio verison by far. And lets talk about Sweet Thing/Candidate. Fantastic dynamics and we are hearing Bowie's recently acquired baritone voice at work. For those of you too young to remember, just a short time before this record, Bowie had that Anthony Newly sound going on which was kind of screechy and irritatingly high. I'm glad he copped the Scott Walker vibe. I realize that Scott Walker is a complete  unknown to anyone under the age of 45 but do a google search kids and you'll be surprised to know that Bowie was mad for this guy's vocal tone to the extent that he emulated it.  <br /> <br />What amazes me most of all are the people who pan this record who do so only because they have done internet searches which indicated a disdain based on the reasons I've desribed above. Don't try to be hip and act like you are in the know just to try to fit in or sound older than you are -  just put aside your pride and preconveived notions and listen to the record and enjoy the awesome musicianship that is on offer here. It blows my mind that bands today can't even begin to reproduce this kind of sound on an organic basis. They have racks of samplers and even then it still sounds thin and heavily quantized.  <br /> <br />I agree that this record isn't perfect and maybe songs like \\"Knock On Wood\\" were a little bit odd to include but so what. It didn't \\"suck\\" an it only preasaged Bowie's flirtation with R&B and Soul that just a few months later resulted in Young Americans album. I must also admit that \\"Rebel Rebel\\" had that phasey,tinny <br />guitar but it wasn't the end of the world.  Frankly all tour versions of Rebel Rebel have been quite weak up until his most recent tour when it was finally restored to its original strength so don't blame \\"David Live\\" for it. Blame Bowie ! I guess he forgot that it was the driving, droning simplicity of the studio version that made it so appealing. Too bad he tried to \\"dress it up\\" in the live versions which only weakened it. <br /> <br />Anyway the new version of this record has been remixed and you can hear the layers and textures that were so flat in the original version. Too bad that Pro Tools technology wasn't available back in 74 else we wouldn't have had to wait so long to get this quality sound.
B000002U8A|3.0|This is an album of mixed pleasures. Some great pop songs intersperced with some tracks that are at best B-Sides. Stand out tracks are New Moon on Monday, Union of the Snake, The Reflex (although this was remixed later as the band were unsure of this mix) and Seventh Stranger....The rest are forgettable and I am sure that the boys would agree, not anywhere near their best. It is always difficult to follow a classic album like RIO, and this does not compare. If you are an avid Duranie, you'll love it, otherwise not recommended.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I'm a rock fan ... I'm not a red hot chili peppers fan. But I began interested in this rock band when I listen the greatest hits & the live album. After finishing listening to these two albums ... I listen the Blood Sugar Sex Magik, one of the best, & Californication another great album. I don't listen By the Way, because I'm afraid to that I did not like. <br />Meanwhile I listen this new double album ... & I'm very impresive. This is one the best albums of the year I one the best albums of the band. The choirs & the Kiedis voice are perfect for the style of this music. The Frusciante guitar are amazing, emulates the greatest guitar of rock history: Hendrix, Clapton, Knofler, Gilmour, etc ... The blues style of the bass of Flea are excelent, like always. And the middle tempo of the drummer Smith are excelent too. <br />This is and complex & complet album ... there are many styles of music ... some kind of blues fusion with rock, some kind of folk or country, very good acoustic songs, & amazing rock & funk songs like Blood sugar sex magik album. <br />It recomends very much. It's an excelent album. I wait for with anxiety the concert. <br />
0385720920|1.0|At first the author's voice reading the book was bothersome - whiny, halting, and \\"don't quit your day job\\" type of reading, however it fit the story perfectly.  I enjoyed listening to this quirky/weird story through maybe chapter 45, but then I had to give it up.  It really went nowhere and was beginning to bore me.  I guess I could have given it two red rubber beads, I mean stars, but I guess the worst review of a book is not being able to finish it.
B000E0WJIC|4.0|Cue the intro to The Poison and it will be clear that Bullet For My Valnetine's first full length promises to be epic. The somber string arrangements and dramatic lead guitar work sound like they could have been taken directly from Metallica's S&M, setting a perfect mood for what in many regards is a good old fashioned thrash metal record.    From there on BFMV follow a fairly standard metalcore formula: throat-searing vocals, rapid fire double bass drum assaults, unnatural harmonics, and dual-shredding guitar solos. While the Welsh metallers may not be pushing the envelope in terms of musical originality, their prowess and technical ability really shine on tracks like Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow, which owe as much to early Megadeth as they do to their contemporaries in Atreyu and Bleeding Through.    If you can look beyond Bullet's lack of originality and the obtruse directness of their lyrics (\\"I loved you; You hurt me!\\" screams frontman Matt Tuck in Room 409), there's no denying that these guys are technically accomplished musicians as well as tight songwriters. Is the market being saturated with this kind of music? Probably, but when it sounds this good, who cares?
B000EMGAGW|4.0|Frist of all why is everyone suprised by the guest appearances?  This album is being reeleased on G-Unit/Aftermath... so if seeing guest spots by 50 and GUnit shocks you then its your own fault for being so naive.  Overall this is a good album. Their lyrics are still gutter.  They do rap about ice a little bit but Mobb has ALWAYS done that and if you think they changed their lyrics for 50 cent once again you are wrong.  They have the exact same lyrical style as they did before, people just wanna hate cuz 50 sings some hooks on the album.  People are reading too much into it... This album is EXACTLY what you would think it would be... Its Mobb Deep (the same mobb that youve always known) with some 50 and Gunit guest spots. Nobody switches styles. Mobb keeps it street, 50 uses his rnb approach, yayo, young buck, lloyd banks etc all use the same style they have been using... so why everyone is so baffled by the sound of this album is beyond me. If you like Mobb Deep and think you might like hearin them with some G Unit artists give the album a try. if you dont think youd like that then dont buy it... But anyone who buys the album and then goes \\"i cant believe 50 is singin hooks\\" deserves their disappointment.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've listened to every single song on this cd, and have come to the conclusion that this cd is very, very good. It has every style the RHCP have ever used, and almost every song is great. There are 2 cds, and the 2 actually have a different sound. The first cd sounds a lot like By the Way, and is more radio friendly stuff. The second cd dives more into experimental stuff, but still has a few really catchy songs on it. That is my opinion, but some others might feel that way too. I noticed a distinct difference in the style of each cd. Now, there were some songs on the second cd that just werent very good. Overall though, there are so many songs on here that it doesnt matter if there are 3 or 4 songs that I dont personally like. And for 11-12 bucks, you cant beat it. RHCP have worked hard on this cd. You can tell. It sounds great, the songs are great, and it is just a great album to have.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Almost everytime a band releases an album of new material they are inclined to talk up the merits of said album.  <br /> <br />Anthony Keidis had this to say about the new Chilli Peppers release 'Stadium Arcadium'.... <br /> <br />'the best thing that we've ever done. There's this weird kind of sublime, subliminal undercurrent that is suggestive, in a spirited way, of our earliest records.'   <br /> <br />After listening to the disk it is hard to argue with him. Stadium Arcadium is up there with other great double rock albums such as the Gunner's 'Use your Illusion 1&2' and the Smashing Pumpkin's 'Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness' and at least on par with the best Chilli Pepper releases like 'Blood...Sugar...Sex...Magik', 'Freaky Styley' and 'Californication'  <br /> <br /> It has been almost four years since their last release 2002's 'By the way' and in that time the Peppers have built an impressive array of material with 28 songs split between two disks (named Jupiter and Mars) and have done so without littering either disk with filler to make up the numbers.  <br /> <br />As he did for 'Californication' Rick Rubin comes on board for production duty and continues the Chilli Pepper's renaissance with similiar texture and harmonies that worked so well on their earlier collaboration, in fact 'Dani California' would fit seamessly on 'Californication... as would 'Snow ((Hey Oh))' (which is apparently Anthony's favorite track on the album) <br /> <br />As usual Flea is all over the place dropping funk bombs with his usual flair and gutso...check out 'Hump de Bump' for some retro Chilli Funk or 'Tell me baby' for it's big bass beat. Anthony sings with his usual gutso but also lay's it down slow for the more laid back tunes singing with a heartfelt yearning for family values on 'Hard to concentrate'or the soulfull 'Slow cheetah'. As usual Chad lays down the beats and is solid throughout without being overpowering.  <br /> <br />The real scene stealer of the album however is John Frusciante who is back to the best blazing guitar power riffs that he was so adept at on Blood Sugar Sex Magik the feedback on 'She's only 18' the massive riff on 'Readymade' or the squealing bridge on 'Torture me'  <br /> <br /> <br />Anthony,Flea, John and Chad have been through a lot over the years from band bust ups with members coming and going, drug and drink problems and controversy over their choice of atire (remember the strategically placed tube socks?) Through it all they have managed to maintain their high level of passion for the punked up funk/rock sound they have made their own and the raw energy that their live performances have become renowned for.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Take the west, its majestic views and quiet nights.  Its hills and mountains and rivers and valleys.  A place that does not change much.  A frontier that often more than not, sees the beauty of nature far more than the ugliness man can sometimes bring to it.<br /><br />Now take that setting, and put man there.  Then in the center put two individuals who are proof as gods creatures, all are created equal, although they will never be treated that way by fellow man.<br /><br />The evil starts to slip in.  It starts to envelope the goodness of the heart and the heart says \\"I must hide\\".  The mind says \\"I must turn away\\".  And the man at the mike says \\"whoaaaah!!\\"  Gotcha, you see the real ignorance behind this movie is not the movie, or the people who were disappointed with it.  Its the people who are trolling here voting negative to every single person who has something to say about the movie that isn't crooning over it like its the next Casablanca of film.  Real prejudice and ignorance lies within, within people who are not willing to accept all gods creatures for who they are.  That is evident on this movies reviews.  People come on here and give it four stars and list a couple of minor faults and get 112 negatives to 23 positives?  That is messed up.  However, perfect in every way, for it shows that even the people who think they are open minded are in fact the ignorant ones.  Why not listen with an open mind?  You tell people to watch the movie with an open mind but then chastise anyone who disagrees with you deeming it a five star diva meant for the hall of fame.  I give the movie<br /><br />five stars, but I know that still wont stop whoever is out there trolling to negate it into never never land because I defend people who are honstley being constructive and intelligent in their crticism of this film.  These people are not the ones who took a tire iron to Jacks face, so stop treating them like they are, otherwise you are the one with the iron in your hand, on the side of the road.

B00005JL78|5.0|Starting four or five years ago, Cruise began collaborating with high-profile directors and producing some films that far exceeded in some way -- concept or spectacle -- whatever else was out at the time.  Suddenly Cruise became not only this big movie star, but a very interesting person besides.  MINORITY REPORT, the first Spielberg-Cruise collaboration, is a superior science fiction-action hybrid, with a very intriguing plot, and an ending so far away from the beginning you could lose track of how you got there.  In fact, when I saw it in the theater, I did.  But I didn't get so lost as to lose sight of the fact that an uncompromising science fiction film had just scrambled my mind.  This was a visionary masterpiece.<br /><br />Set in the far future year of 2054, Anderton (Cruise) is the chief of a new crime unit called Pre-crime.  In a bang-up opening sequence that demonstrates how the unit works, a SWAT-like team respond to an alarm triggered by three narcotized psychics afloat in a special isolation chamber.  The crime is merely predicted at this point.  The team invades the house, stops the would-be perpetrator just in the nick of time, then arrests him.  Because no actual crime has been committed, the predicted perpetrator is \\"haloed\\" -- an electronic headband that's shoved on his head and blanks him out -- and put into a special suspension storage facility.  After this sequence, we learn that there hasn't been a murder since the unit went into operation.  But it raises sticky moral and constitutional questions about imprisoning someone for a crime that never occurred, and the Pre-crime program is under review.  Enter a suspicious agent (Colin Farell), a menacing smartass seemingly with an axe to grind.<br /><br />Then the \\"precogs\\" -- the psychics -- predict the next murder, and the predicted perpetrator is none other than Anderton himself, his victim a man he's never even met.  Comprehending immediately that he's been set up by someone, he escapes to investigate who.  The escape and pursuit of clues is a formula for action, but Spielberg and Cruise refused to dumb it down to appeal just to the action crowd.  The plot deepens as you go along, interspersed with full-throttle action through a sleek metropolis fascinating in its conceptualization.<br /><br />The cinematography shows the future in sterilized colors, suggesting that everything was sleekly utilitarian, melding dazzling form with commonplace function, a corporate wonderland.  Every surface serves as an animated billboard scanning the passerby's eyes for identification, triggering sexy advertisements in which svelte models seamlessly refer to you by name and coo the latest fashion accouterments.  The casual acceptance of technical advancement is further suggested by the fact that an ex-con living in a government subsidized apartment building can perform a double eye transplant for a couple of thousand bucks.  And there are automobiles that deliver you right up to your apartment, and jet packs and 3-D home movies, and even a retired geneticist-cum-avocational botanist creating slithering plant life to assist in home security.  So while you're following this plot, you can be distracted by a technological wonderland regaling the senses in almost every scene.<br /><br />Lending texture to the film, there were respites from the warble of technology and breakneck chases, usually in the homes of the privileged, in the country, where the plot is deepened and suspicions widened.  During it all, there is no cool glibness to fit some movie star's image, no moments of actor self-indulgence.  Obviously Spielberg corralled everyone toward creating a real film, and not some blockbuster fiasco to be written off when the receipts were counted and the summer was over.<br /><br />The image on the DVD is sharp and pristine, capturing what I remembered it looked like in the theater.  The second disc has interviews and special effects pieces for those of us who really enjoyed thismovie and want to know all about it.  For science fiction fans, this is definitely one to add to the library.  This will be looked upon in the future as one of the good ones.ll about it.

B000056N8X|1.0|This is my first review of anything. I found this movie to be an honest piece of garbage. Conner MacLeod appears to be totally different from the original movie. He is aloof, shadowy and distant. He won the prize. How the heck are they still fighting Immortals. Why couldn't the dummies who wrote this film had some sort of continuity with the 1st film? <br /> <br /> <br />       They could have made a movie by placing it between events in the first film. Any true fans of these films must agree with me. I am not one to nitpick on minutiae (spelling??) but this is pure nonsense. Duncan kills Conner?!, c'mon what kind of bullcrap is that. I'm going to try to send this back and get my money back. Why didn't a review explain this blatant contradiction? <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is a great 2 cd set.  I love it because it's a very diverse set of songs and it's one of those cd's that gets better the more that you listen to it.  I actually like the second cd (Mars) better than the first cd (Jupiter).  It seems like the band experimented more with the music on the second cd.  The first cd seems to have more of a commercial appeal, but I still love it.  Love John's guitar work!  It's brilliant!  Flea is awesome as usual too!
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Forget everything you have read or heard about comparisons to Sabbath and Zeppelin. It's a moot point. Let those comparisons only describe the genre. This album stands on its own. If there had never been a Sabbath or Zep we would all still like this disc because it is amazing. It's the riffs. The hooks. That thick heavy groove. . .ahhhhhhhh. Shangri-La. <br /> <br />This is not a retro band as some have said. This is a rock band. This is what rock is supposed to sound like. Just because there haven't been any good ones for a long time doesn't mean anything.  <br /> <br />Welcome back, riff-based rock. We missed you. <br /> <br />I just saw Wolfmother last Saturday May 6 in Dallas in a small venue with about 2,000 other fans. I cannot begin to write how grateful I saw them so up-close because the opportunity will not present itself for a long time. These guys will be selling out stadiums very soon. You can take that to the bank. <br /> <br />Buy the album. Go see them if they come to your town. Get excited about the renaissance.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I wasn't the only one to scratch their head in amazement that Tool decided to name their new album \\"10,000 Days.\\" Concordantly, I'm probably not the only one to take back my initial shock and replace it with praise after listening to the title track. \\"10,000 Days\\" is one hell of an album in and of itself and is more than impressive.<br /><br />Epic. \\"10,000 Days\\" is epic.<br /><br />When you begin to listen to the album, you get one of the most straightforward songs on the album with 'Vicarious.\\" It's a bit disheartening at first when you hear that the guitars sound almost exactly the same as the guitars on \\"Schism,\\" but you'll have to overlook that. \\"Vicarious\\" is a song about Maynard's (real or fictional) reality TV fixation and his need to see death on the screen. But don't fret faithful Tool fan, the band is by no means stretched for material, the remainder of the album is filled with amazing and powerful lyrical content that could change your life. Honestly.<br /><br />This brings me to the 17-minute epic of \\"Wings for Marie/10,000 Days.\\" These two songs were written for Maynard's mother, whom apparently passed away a few years back. This is, without question, the most powerful Tool song on the album, and possibly to date. The lyrical content of \\"10,000 Days\\" is something that must be soaked in, not simply read. The song speaks of his mother's faith, her genuine nature, and her ascension to heaven (\\"Wings for Marie\\"). Unlike many Tool songs that start soft and steadily builds to its rock-out climax, \\"10,000 Days\\" toys with this idea but never sees it come to complete fruition. Though it climaxes, it never actually makes you want to rock out. It is my assumption that this is out of respect, but it also conveys the sincerity in Maynard's emotion and artistic creation quite vividly. He sings, \\"Please forgive this bold suggestion/Should you see your maker's face tonight/look em in the eye/look em in the eye, and tell them i never lived a lie/ never took a life but surely saved one, hallelujah!\\" The song is passionate, real and honest. It deserves to be treated as such.<br /><br />In my opinion, the album climaxes on track 4 with \\"10,000 Days.\\" However, it's hard to bring yourself back up after such a draining song. That is not to discount the rest of the album, however. Fans of Tool will recognize this as their more typical sound. \\"The Pot,\\" for example, is 6+ minutues of rock goddotry that examines substance abuse and hypocracy. Maynard exclaims, \\"So who are you to wave your finger? Who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?\\" and it just makes you want to say \\"HELL YEAH!\\" while throwing your fist (or a finger) in the air. From there, Tool has unfortunately decided to add a lot of filler tracks like \\"Lipan Conjuring,\\" \\"Lost Keys,\\" and \\"Viginiti Tres,\\" leaving only 3 of the final 6 songs on the album for the listener to enjoy. Though these filler tracks are interesting on first listen, they don't seem to set a mood or add to the album. \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" and \\"Intension\\" are both songs that are good in their own right, but are ultimately inconsequential in the shadow of the first half of the album. In fact, \\"Right In Two\\" is really the only song on the second half of the album worth mentioning. It starts of slowly but builds into a strong rock track that features unforgiving drumming, amazing guitars, and (what?) the bongos, which surprisingly add a lot to the song.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it, \\"10,000 Days\\" is an incredible album. With this album, Tool builds on their signature sound with lush backgrounds and intimate vocals and lyrics. However, the structuring of the album is ultimately its demise as the band seems too eager to fill a CD up to its limits. With 3 undeniable filler tracks, one has to wonder what this album would be like with only 8 tracks. Without question, it would be a shorter CD, but it might also be a better one.

B000EULJLU|4.0|well like all the other tool fans out there, i love the album.  but i also felt slightly slighted.  i mean when you hear that there are only about 5 or 6 songs on it, its the truth.  now don't get me wrong, i like the other songs, but when tool can rock like can why not use the space for more sonically booming songs.  they other thing that was kinda frustrating is maynards voice.  its awesome on some songs but alot of the time he is just kind of mumbling or talking.  again, when you can sound as good as he does why not belt it out?   but i gave it 4 stars because it really is a good album. maybe even great.  even the few misgivings of the album cant take away its effect.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|pearl jam, have spent the last ten years trying to evolve their sound, from the grunge heydays and make a new evolution and i must say \\"PEARL JAM HAVE MADE THEIR BEST ALBUM IN YEARS\\"   the cover, maybe an bit mundane but it gets it's job DONE..     this album starts off with a cracking track \\"life wasted\\"   with the blistering riff and off the cust, lyrics that you'd expect from MR eddie vedder   and then the number 1 single in america \\"world wide suicide\\"   which at first listen on mtv2 i thought was rubbish but as i processed in listening to the song again i believe it will be one of the best songs released this year..     after songs that captured my attention[apart from all thirteen]   were gone big wave severed hand[an absolute classic pogression for pearl jam]   army reserve and wasted reprise[wasted reprise being mellow and beautiful]     i must agree with hundred other reviewers this is an classic rock album from an band that processed from the grunge heyday and after an couple experimental albums they have landed on their feet     \\"MASTERPIECE\\"
0393057658|5.0|I have been a serious baseball fan for over 25 years.  I thought I knew the sport pretty well.  Moneyball changed all of that.  The book really opened my eyes on the real inner workings of building a MLB team.  Like many other baseball buffs I have built many fantasy baseball teams, but the book describes how building a real team is vastly more complex.  The chapters that describe the limited use of traditional scouts are fascinating.  While I love baseball stats and scouting reports, I now look at them very differently than before.  The book proves that baseball truly is a thinking man's sport.  Moneyball will go down as one of the most influential baseball books of all time.
B000069HJM|2.0|Coming out from 1987, wherein rock music at that time have evolved into another phase of a generation - in this case with avant-garde sounding alternative bands, consisting a mix of classical, choral, jazz fusion and some mixture of a highly developed punk sound in their forte - mainly headlined by the likes of The Pursuit Of Happiness, R.e.m., Bolshoi, Peter Murphy, Clannad, Midnight Oil, the Prefab Sprout among others, and most notably U2 itself which released their epic THE JOSHUA TREE album - along fellow veteran art-rock group Yes coming up with their highly powered follow up album BIG GENERATOR to their biggest hit 90125 (geared under the influence by South African artist Trevor Rabin (who've had himself collaborated with Roger Hodgson on Yes' TALK album)) at the same time -- Supertramp under the tutelage of Rick Davies presented this album, which in an attempt to carry on and fly-off without the band's other wing Roger Hodgson - which comes as perhaps the palest album that could ever be encountered from the band.   Sounding nothing less than an adult contemporary oriented stuff, it opens with Davies' \\"It's Alright\\", wherein it could be cited thus as Supertramp's equivalent to Queen's take on the pop/dance genre with the album HOT SPACE, along U2 itself for the album simply called POP --- thus as certain rock bands who've taken such attempt in their stride (whether for commercial or experimental reasons) are well scolded, ridiculed and scoffed at out of it; and all for the good reason, being that none of these bands are really well with trying to tread upon such a territory where they are not well inclined nor are apt with for their own grounds. Hence Supertramp's FREE AS A BIRD (not the Beatle track of course) is a mediocre album.       Considering Supertramp's set of fanbase along with other faithful Supertramp-fans across the globe, perhaps Davies is right to pursue Hodgson not to leave the band, considering the materials that Hodgson came up with on his first solo album EYE OF THE STORM, that if matched along with the combination of what input that Davies is capable to contribute on his own credit to juice up their broth - doubtless that Supertramp may've been among the biggest established band that there is amongst the other veteran rock bands out there, that is, if Hodgson did stick around with the group.  Thus as what Davies have spoken of from the lines on the song \\"Waiting So Long\\" of their final album with Hodgson, the FAMOUS LAST WORDS Lp=    \\"Did you say what you mean?  Do you mean what you say?  About this new scene   Is it really that way...    Yes I've been waiting such a long time  Just for something to ring true  Now I'd rather taste the old wine  Than mess around with something new.    And the blindness goes on...\\"      FREE AS A BIRD however gives a straight shot of what would turn out completely for the direction that the band went into under Davies' complete control - which is fully realized in their album SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE that came up exactly after a ten-year span from this album; where in that one, the band is consisting a host of band members that rivaled the size of other groups by the likes of Chicago or Electric Light Orchestra (for that matter), along with original SUPERTRAMP regulars John Helliwell and Bob Siebenberg in the line-up, and featuring Mark Hart coming on as an equivalent to fill in the space that Hodgson left within the band of sorts, who've first spew his own shot of vocals on the title track to this one \\"Free As A Bird\\", along with the song \\"Where I Stand\\" which is the first to come out written by Hart with Davies. Hart did a good take on the said album SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE though, with the songs \\"Sooner or Later\\" and that grooving track \\"Give Me A Chance\\", which subtly as such comes as a plea of his of sorts for the fans, that are both co-written with Davies as well.   Hart's compositions are pretty good enough to pass on par with something a little bit like those of Todd Rundgren's songs.    FREE AS A BIRD also continues with the thematic lyrical persuasions by Davies of sorts to Hodgson (hidden behind coated scenarios of a guy pursuing a chick) within as it went with for a number of the songs that Davies have came up with since Hodgson's departure from the band, quite peculiarly with this album FREE AS A BIRD is the song \\"It Doesn't Matter\\", which featured in its back-up vocal lines something that is sounding like a mock-like parody quite obviously and nothingless of Hodgson's vocal style - that goes similarly to the case of the song from SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE, its feature track \\"You Win, I Lose\\" along with the pun implied within its lyrics (that however nearly ruined the band's reputation with the presence of big-hooter model  Anna Nicole Smith on its video clip - so goes for such with the bile of Music Videos' inherently evil downsides), also along with the tracks \\"Live to Love You\\", and more openly on \\"And The Light\\" from SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE, where Davies appears to be even coming on to the point of breaking out.  FREE AS A BIRD ends with a track that recycles the lyrics (a trait that the band's inclined to, time and time again) - thematically to \\"Child of Vision\\" (the track that closed their biggest album BREAKFAST IN AMERICA) with various languages inserted, including a tagalog line `hindi ko alam' (meaning: I don't know) - which perhaps lived up to its title - \\"An Awful Thing To Waste\\", being that Davies' songwriting for the most part seem to have arrived at certain points as a cheat for the fans, considering that with his Roger Waters-esque like songwriting type of rendering for some of the songs he'd come up with - often there would be lengthy half-an-album-side tracks which seemed to've been written only within a whim of a minute.  Furthermore, Hodgson however, is reportedly generously appreciative of SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE, and coming on to good terms have agreed to finally return with the band, but all prospects for the possibility of this reunion have shortly vaporized when Davies broke the vow not to perform any of Hodgson's materials in the band's live shows in his (Hodgson's) absence.     And it was so that the ghost of having the presence of Roger Hodgson in the band would forever haunt Supertramp's continued existence, as permeatedly(sic) found upon many lines from the songs of the band since Hodgson's departure came in place.     Thus with the case thereof -- the line from the title track (which is something that came around long before the ever-suicidal Kurt Cobain of Nirvana came up with his epitaph-like swansong \\"You Know You're Right\\" of such in its lyrical veins) - apparently reflecting the notion or Davies' wishful-thinking that the band might somehow still be able to take-off, despite of Hodgson's absence (that is seemingly then refuted by the track \\"I'm Begging You\\" that followed which opened side two on the lp):    \\"Now I'm free as a bird  As I walk out of that door you have my word  I wont bother you no more  Yes Im feeling OK  As I face a brand new day\\"    and...    \\"It's gonna be a brand new story,  What's the use of former glory\\"    Yeah, right.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVIEW ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED 30 APRIL 2006, supposedly Crutchead's 76th review For Amazon
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam's last two albums were a bit lackluster,though they had some good moments. But this album is just great all through out. I would strongly recommend this album...it demonstrates why they have been a band for as long as they've been.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is the best album the Red Hot Chili Peppers have ever put out. <br />Nothing will top it,  <br />But it doesnt mean their albums are not good, they rock to. (Californication, By The Way, One Hot Minute, Stadium Arcadium, etc...)  <br />But nothing and i mean nothing will ever top this album, why? because it rocks. <br />The best songs are, Power of Equality,If You Have to ask, UNDER THE BRIDGE, give it away, SIR PYSCHO SEXY, Blood sugar sex magic(the song) and The righteous and the wicked. but the others are still damn good. but not as good as the ones stated.
B000001Y42|5.0|but this album is probably the best 'nu-metal' album ever released.  Oh $hit, did I say that out loud?  Ok, so here's an album that has just about everything going for it and promised to bring only good things from it's band BUT...sadly though, this was a one time thing.  From the opening track 'POLLUTION' if you've heard any of Limp's other records you'll know your in for something different to day the least, and if you've never heard Limp Bizkit (I don't think that's possible) then you know your in for a treat.  'POLLUTION' is a great heavy nu-metal track.  What you'll notice about this album is that even though it has rap/rock influence it's less rap and more rock, or I should say less rap beats and more heavy guitars...and a lot more screaming.  'COUNTERFEIT' is the best track here...brutal and intense and NOTHING like anything on their other records.  'NOBODY LOVES ME' is one of the sickest songs ever (thats a good thing), brutal brutal brutal.  'SOUR' slows things down, but then 'STALEMATE' blows them up again.  Notworthy is the first single and cover of George Michaels 'FAITH' which is BRILLIANT in every way.  It starts off simular to the original but Fred Durst vocals and his constant screaming make this an AMAZING track!  'STINK FINGER' is one of my favorite tracks as well...not sure what it's about, something about a loser in college I think but I could be SOOOOOO wrong.  'LEECH;, the demo track, is raw and awsome to say the least and I'm so glad they included this track here instead of cleaning it up or trashing it all together.  'INDIGO FLOW' has a great kick back vibe, and the closing track 'EVERYTHING' does the album well.  THis is a brilliant debut, it's just sad that they haven't released a single track that comes close to being the Limp we all knew they could have been.  Forget their 'Greatest Hits' album, buy this...this is the greatest hits!
B000EMGAOY|3.0|The Chili Peppers go back to their funk roots in their newest album \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" and this example can be heard in songs like the fifth track \\"Hump De Bump\\". The songs have to grow on you. I found myself thinking that some songs are average but I began to like it the more I heard it and the song progressed. The album overall feels that way. It's one of those albums that will grow to be appreciated more overtime.<br /><br />The title song \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is a great song. It's very melodic and you find yourself imaging what kind of a music video this song would make. With a record being this big, every song can't be perfection. I didn't really care for some songs, an example of that being track six \\"She's only 18\\". If you didn't like the single \\"Dani California\\", you probably won't like this album. It's basically that kind of sound, give or take, the entire album.
0679422714|2.0|A grindingly unreadable biography. I started to lose interest when the authors kept writing sentences such as: \\"Lo Pu told Po Lu to go to see Ko Lu and settle accounts.\\" Yes, go on with it then! Also: \\"Zhong Zhuzing (who we shall now refer to as ZZZ)...\\" Then why not also \\"refer\\" to Mao as MTT throughout? The sections describing Mao's infidelity are interesting and the people come alive, but otherwise the actions and individuals remain (to me) remote and mechanical.The authors fail to provide much of a context for all this running around and slaying and betrayal.Illuminates the relationship between China and Russia pretty well.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I've got to say, I loved this movie!  It brought back a lot of fond memories of FF VII.  Do you need to know the game to get the movie?...Not necessarily, but if you were into the game way back when...Oh man, are you gonna love this movie!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|A surprise came when my computer and stereo did not read the second disc to Stadium Arcadium.  On my way back to the store to exchange, I discovered that my *new* CD player could read the disc.  Is this part of an anti-piracy campaign?  Fine, I just wish there was a disclaimer...so there it is from me. <br /> <br />*RHCP continue to rock- Dont criticize, just ease back and listen.*
B000F0UV0E|4.0|This is a really good record, but it's not as good as everyone is giving it credit for. The Amazon reviewer has got it right. The album IS too tame. It IS overall too midtempo. And it doesn't really have a centerpiece although 'This Is Us' might be considered one. Does this album take big chances? Unequivocally, no. It sure doesn't. Of course, there are some really good songs such as 'Beachcombing' and 'Belle Starr' to name two. Some are just fun songs like 'Red Staggerwing' but others are way too sleepy and bland to be ranking this a 5 star album. 'Beyond My Wildest Dreams', yes it's got the nice and pretty acoustic guitar but it also is pretty bland with a cliche chorus that makes your mind wander. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the album is bad and if you read the Amazon reviewer's review, she didn't say it was bad either. I should probably get upwards of 50 flames for giving this four instead of five stars. If you played this album at a family reunion, no-one would bat an eye. Now, that doesn't make it a bad album, but it does mean that it's very safe and very pleasant.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|WOW, what a thoughtful inciteful and completely inspiring review I read a couple reviews down calling this album horrible. How dare you, and then they go on to insult the fans by saying \\"True\\" Pepper fans should stay away.. Well the fact is if you don't embrace every aspect of everything that the Chili Peppers create then you are not a true fan. If you don't take the time to embrace every factor that an artist creates musically then you are not a fan of music in general. This album is seriously just from top to bottom, front to back, Jupiter to Mars f-n awesome. I'm not saying that because the reviewer below is a multi platinum recording artist and obviously knows what he is talking about, and I'm not saying this in retaliation to the bad review. It's just a little thing I like to call \\"the truth\\".
B00005B364|5.0|This album was so well composed and executed that it has easily stood the test of time. It is good music through and through; clever, exciting, beautiful and moving. This band of dutch guys really knew what they were doing and boy could they play. They were (and still are) essentially an instrumental outfit with the melody carried by guitar, flute, keyboards and occasionally vocals. Focus didn't appear to be too much swayed by music fashions or commercial pressures of the music business when they recorded this album and that is one of the reasons why \\"Moving Waves\\" still sounds as fresh and exciting today as it did when it was released in the early 1970's.    The album kicks off with the one that was released as a 45, \\"Hocus Pocus\\" a thunderous, relentless rocker composed by Akkerman and van Leer. Suitably titled and very clever, it has lots of surprises, tricks and dazzling guitar licks and is comewhat comical. Keyboardist Thijs (pronounced Tys) van Leer plays the jester with his wild flute playing, whistling, yodelling and other crazy vocal gymnastics, effortlessly hitting notes higher than Brian and Carl Wilson ever went on any Beach Boys recording. Not to be outdone, guitarist Jan Akkerman provides a lot of the thrills and excitement with his amazing gibson les paul antics and oh what a cracking job by the Rhythm section, drummer Pierre van der Linden and bassist Cyril Havermans.    In contrast to this on the next track Jan displays his talent as a classical guitarist by playing his own composition, the gentle, haunting \\"Le clochard\\". Nice touch by Thijs with the mellotron backing which adds a touch of weirdness and eeriness to the piece. GORGEOUS. Track 3 \\"Janis\\" is another Akkerman compostion and features Thijs on multitracked, interwoven flute parts. This is probably the weakest track on the album, but is still interesting to listen to. The impressionistic title track \\"Moving waves\\" is one of the sayings of Hazrat Inayat Khan set to music by Thijs on vocals and piano. Listen to the words with the music that van Leer has written. The rippling piano chords and the crecendos and diminuendos conjur up the image of the waves as they \\"become excited and then all calm together\\". The ascending last few chords rise with the waves as they \\"reach upwards\\" (to the moon). This is good composing. Track 5, oh yes! Thijs van Leer's \\"Focus II\\" with Jazz and Classical influences and the most beautifully sensitive guitar playing by Jan. It is typical of Akkerman to add expression with the use of dynamics and subtle phrasing to enhance a melody as he does on this magical piece. STUNNING, however the best is yet to come.    The last track is made up of several different compositions, most by Thijs who came up with the overall concept \\"Eruption\\", aptly titled lasting 23 minutes. It commences with a line of music borrowed from Monteverdi's \\"L'Orfeo\\" with Thijs on Hammond organ and Jan using his violin guitar effect (volume control tweaking. You hear a smooth note without the plucking). The music is mesmerizing and quickly grabs your attention. After a few minutes it bursts into life taking you on a journey through the most amazing music with stunning guitar solos that never get boring and a couple of incredibly skillful and creative drum solos which add hugely to the overall piece and don't lose one's interest for a second. The richly melodic guitar oriented section \\"Tommy/Pupilla\\" segment is spine tinglingly sublime. The range of musical styles in this piece is incredible, from the Renaissance-style \\"Orpheus\\" and \\"Dayglow\\" to the Latin American style organ solo segment of \\"The bridge\\". The impact of each composition is enhanced by the contrast between it and the next, but despite the great variety it all flows and makes musical sense. Thijs displays his talent a a flautist producing the richest timbres achievable on a flute. His jazz-rock hammond organ playing is fabulous. I wonder if dutchman Eddie van Halen was paying homage to Focus whenhe used the title \\"Eruption\\" for his ground-breaking guitar piece for solo guitar in the late 70's.    Musically the band were in a different league to any other at the time if you consider the musical progressions within each piece and the expertise of each musician. Technically brilliant with a lot of feel and a real understanding of music, Jan Akkerman is one of the best and most versatile guitarists in the business. Drummer Pierre van der Linden has a lot of musicality, not only providing the beat and rhythm, but hugely augmenting the music with his incredibly creative, expressive and  skillful drumming. Cyril Havermans (later replaced by Bert Ruiter) plays a highly musical, rhythmic and solid bass. Multi-talented keyboardist, flautist and vocalist Thijs van Leer has a great gift for composition and has written music which stands among THE MOST EXCITING, ORIGINAL AND BRILLIANT ROCK/POP MUSIC EVER PRODUCED.    If you want to hear something dramatically different, then give \\"Moving waves\\" a few listens and you will be much rewarded. This is one of the best albums of \\"rock/pop\\" music ever recorded.
068484267X|3.0|Even at the most difficult of times, there is always hope for better to come. The narrator of the story, Frank McCourt, conveys this throughout his acclaimed memoir Angela's Ashes. Born in Depression-era Brooklyn and raised in Limerick, Ireland, Frank lived in poverty throughout most of his life. His mother, Angela, would sing to her children at night, giving them hope that one day there would be enough food and happiness for everyone, even though there was barely any hope left for herself. It is the coming-of-age story of Frank McCourt as he grows from an impoverished childhood to a maturity at the age of nineteen, when he is able to plan his own course in life. Before the age of ten, Frank is a witness to the death of his sister and two brothers. His father does not work much and when he does, he spends all of his earnings drinking at the local pub. He also is fond of telling stories and reminding the children that they hopefully will die for Ireland. Through all of the difficult times he had to endure, he grows spiritually, morally and intellectually. His family remains strong in spirit even through the poverty, near starvation and harassment.  <br /> This wonderfully written and deeply moving memoir is a story that changes your perspective and captivates your heart. It is narrated in the first person and is told in the present tense. This kind of immediacy centers on the reality of the child's experiences and avoids the impression, as the past tense might, that the story is being reflected upon by an adult on his childhood. The language used throughout the memoir is informal and common. Regional, Irish phrases, and vulgar expressions are used often to convey the way people really talked during the author's childhood in Limerick. Both tears and smiles are brought together as close as they be in this style of writing. An example of type of language used: \\"The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says: `Och, Angela,' puts on his cap and goes for a long walk\\" (113). The theme of poverty is persistent throughout the memoir. To the people in Limerick, poverty is accepted as a fact of life; there is nothing much to help the poor out of their misery.  <br />The title of the memoir indicates the ashes that fall from Angela's cigarettes and those in the fireplace that she continuously stares at blankly. Her ashes represent her crumbling hopes of raising a healthy family with a supportive husband. These dreams are withering and have almost died so that all she is left with are the smoldering ashes from the fire that provides them warmth. Frank grows to learn that he must take on the responsibility of keeping his own dreams alive in the end. At the end of the book, he leaves his broken family behind in order to make himself whole again in America.  <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but usually stick to their older stuff (think Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magik), and this album comes closer to the level of the old stuff than any of the more recent albums.   <br /> <br />For all of you out there that are still touting Californication as the best album, go out and buy Mother's Milk, and take a listen.  They have definitely calmed down throughout the years making more melodic music and songs, and leaving behind the funky rock beats and shouting that was prevalent in the older stuff.   <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium comes much closer to this old stuff than anything has in a while, but still has a lot of the slower songs, which means it probably won't push out Blood Sugar Sex Magik as their top album.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|This record will take you places. The Red Hot Chili Pepper's released one of my favorite albums of all time in 2002 with By The Way, and going into this one I knew it was going to be hard to top. While I think It's safe to say I still prefer By The Way to Stadium Arcadium, there is no denying the power this record posesses. Songs like Wet Sand and Animal Bar show a huge step in growth for the Pepper's, channeling the unknown spirits of life and death and bringing them full circle. Other tracks are great, but feel out of place in the structure of the record. What I believe it comes down to is an over abundance. Had the record been on one cd, it would probably work better as an album. What we have here is a collection of amazing songs. Really some of the best performances of the groups career. Highly recomended.
B00011CZRE|5.0|This is an outstanding thriller, one of my favorite movies. However, if you are thinking of buying this movie, do NOT buy the single-disc edition unless you feel like having to flip the disc over halfway through the movie. I bought this edition, not knowing that half of the movie is on one side of the disc and half on the other side. That is so retarded. I see the logic for a 3 or 4 hour movie having this, but not a 2-hour one like this one. Go with the New Line Platinum Edition, which has the whole movie on one side. I used to own the NLP edition so I know that's how the dvd is. I'm definately returning this edition and getting the NLP edition.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney Spears isn't an amazing singer, but lots of artists out there aren't that amazing either.  On Oops!...I Did It Again, her record-breaking sophomore release, her tepid vocals are often overproduced and electronic, a trend heard again on 2003's In the Zone, but that doesn't mean the material stinks; actually, this album is her most consistent.  The title track is the biggest, most popular song on the record, and one of Spears' biggest hits, and deservedly so--it's sheer brilliance in a breezy and quite entertaining three and a half minutes.  \\"Stronger\\" is excellent as well, though extremely overproduced vocally.  \\"Lucky,\\" like its predecessors, is also overproduced and electronic, but the message is autobiographical for Britney and it's a listenable song.  The remaining tracks on Oops!...I Did It Again follow similar suit, save for the awful ballads (excluding the somewhat decent \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know\\"), as being consistent pop songs.  Though this is probably her most ridiculed in terms of her performances, Britney Spears made a great pop album despite its flaws.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|Very simple... if you liked the Peppers before they completely wussed out, you will hate this album. <br /> <br />Chili Peppers pre-Blood Sugar Sex Magik were fantastic.  Everything since then has been awful and they seem to be getting worse with every album.  This album is no exception to that trend. <br /> <br />Real RHCP fans, stay FAR, FAR away from this garbage.
B000BAQ8A0|4.0|This is a wonderful performance, but the DVD suffers from an abyssmal video presentation.  While the camera work is very good, and the image IS anamorphically enhanced (for widescreen televisions), it appears as though the image was cropped from a standard-resolution video master.  As a result, there is considerable video noise and widespread (almost distracting) compression artifacts.  On a large screen the video is almost unwatchable.  Maybe I've been spoiled by opera DVDs made from high definition masters, but the video here is a major disappointment.<br /><br />I'd give a 5 for the performance and camera work.<br /><br />I'd give a 2-3 for the video presentation (it would be even lower if it was not anamorphic).
B000EULJLU|5.0|I had heard \\"Vicarious\\" on the radio and instantly identified it as a Tool song, and after the song ended I wanted to hear more of the songs on this new album.  Friends of mine were playing other tracks they got off filesharing services (which I don't advocate) and thought the album was in stores already. <br /> <br />Fast forward to May 2nd, and my friend and I saw the CD in a record store and figured it was out for a while...and even though we didn't have a CD player on us, we were awed at the package itself...the 3-D images are nothing like I've ever seen for album art and it prepares you for the Epic that awaits your CD player. <br />Epic is the only word that describes this sonic masterpiece.  Simply press \\"play\\" and put your headphones on and ride the emotional waves Maynard and Co. have crafted for us.  <br /> <br />Some tracks of note: <br />Vicarious--First single off this album but not the last...Excellent opener. <br />Wings of Marie/10,000 Days--A 17 min. song that goes from soft and thoughtful to an emotional crescendo that demands repeat listens. <br />The Pot--Filled with bass riffs and different shades of Maynard. <br />Rosetta Stoned--Yet another song that clocks in over 11 Min. and ends with what sounds like a eulogy to Layne Staley. <br />Right in Two--This song Plays deceptively slow at the beginning, almost like an APC song, but builds to a \\"Stinkfist\\" conclusion. <br /> <br />This album has been in my CD drive since May 2nd and gets better with every listen.  These songs grab you by the soul and don't let go.  Buy this CD....and don't download it!  Its worth every penny!
B0000640VO|5.0|\\"Amelie\\" is one of the more difficult movies to do a writeup for, simply because it's so completely off on its own: to my knowledge, there's never been another movie like this, before or since.  It's got a vibe all of it's own that makes it an inspiring and comedic standout. <br /> <br />   Amelie Poulain - played to perfection by Audrey Tatou in one of the world's alltime great performances - is a shy, somewhat elflike, highly idealistic girl with a strong sense of justice, an extremely acive imagination, and a thinly buried flair for mischief a mile wide.  After finding an old box of childhood treasures hidden behind some boards in her apartment, she takes it upon herself to track down the original owner of these toys and odds-&-ends.  When the original owner turns out to be a now-quite-melancholy older man who is deeply cheered by the return of these old memories, and touched by someone's having taken the time and effort to return them, Amelie too is uplifted, and thereafter takes it upon herself to help those whose lives she feels could use a boost.  In spite of her impish altruism, though, Amelie is unable to pursue her own dreams of her own accord, and the question of the movie is whether life will work out for Amelie even as she's secretly helping others to achieve their own dreams.  Of historical note, the movie features the best performance ever by a ceramic garden gnome(!) whom Amelie abducts from its owner's garden and sends on various trips around the world to get its picture taken and sent to the owner before its eventual triumphant return home, in hopes of inspiring that person to follow up on their own dream of world travel!  The angle is played so beautifully that the gnome actually becomes his own character, and it inspired the growing global trend of benevolent 'gnome-napping' that you may heard about, and has made its way into numerous travel commercials.  That there is just one of the many inventive schemes Amelie hatches to try and 'push' people towards happiness. <br /> <br />Truly, a one-of-a-kind movie, totally delightful.
B000A2H812|4.0|I'd never heard of Gogol Bordello, but they were one of the opening bands when I went to see Cake a few months ago.  We arrived in the middle of their set, and for a minute there I thought we had accidentally gone to the circus instead of a concert. <br /> <br />For the rest of their set, the four of us had a lot of laughs.  In fact, my comment at one point was \\"This sounds like gypsy punk\\".  Little did I know.  Unfortunately, the sound was horrendous and the stage antics only lended themselves to some hardy laughter.  It was certainly entertaining, there was no doubt. <br /> <br />A few weeks later, a co-worker of mine and I were on a business trip and we ran across this CD at a local record store.  He bought it and we promptly threw it into the rental car's CD player.  To our amazement, it not only sounded a lot like what we'd heard live, but it sounded much better. <br /> <br />I like fusions as much as the next guy, which I suppose is why I appreciate Gogol Bordello.  Would I go out and buy more of their stuff?  Probably not, but not because it's bad.  It's a very interesting listen and I credit these guys for creating something genuinely unique.  For that reason alone, I'd recommend this CD to anybody who thrives on different musical styles.  If your tastes run along the lines of most FM radio, you may not appreciate this.  If your tastes are more eclectic, you could do a lot worse than Gogol Bordello! <br /> <br />Viva la gypsys.
B000EGDB10|4.0|Brian De Palma's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is nearly summarized by a line from Emmanuelle Beart's character.  \\"Ethan,\\" she says, \\"you're not making much sense.\\"  How right she is.  The plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is a jumbled mess, thanks in part to director De Palma's bizarre yet artistic style.    What's clear is this: Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force).  The IMF is a top-secret division of the CIA which handles difficult undercover missions.  Hunt and his teammates, led by Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), are on a routine assignment when things go horribly wrong.  Phelps' team is ambushed and the team members are murdered, with the exception of Hunt.  But wait, it gets worse: Hunt is framed for the murders and is now being pursued by the IMF's other operatives.  It's up to Hunt to prove his innocence and find the real murderer(s), while evading his former agency.    The cast and crew is full of talent.  We have director De Palma, who's famous for his thrilling, artistic films, which include CARRIE, DRESSED TO KILL, BLOW OUT, SCARFACE, and THE UNTOUCHABLES.  De Palma is really the driving force behind the movie.  He gives it a dark, shady atmosphere, taking the film to bizarre new levels with his intriguing camera work, which include tilted close-ups and the occasional point-of-view shot.  Tom Cruise is great as Ethan Hunt, making us sympathize with this resourceful, clever young man.  Henry Czerny gives a good performance as the head of the IMF.  Jean Reno is typically good, but he's not given much to work with.  Ving Rhames is very likable as computer expert Luther Stickell.    Danny Elfman, always one to write memorable, original scores, delivers another fine soundtrack.  He puts Lalo Schifrin's unforgettable theme song to very good use.  At times, Elfman's score resembles the music of classic 60's spy shows - one of which was, of course, the original MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  The screenplay, by David Koepp and Robert Towne, bears little(if any) resemblance to the series on which its based.  Perhaps because of this, over the years the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE film series has come to stand on its own from the TV series.  The Koepp/Towne script is very good considering that, at its heart, this film IS an action movie.  Their script is based on a story by Koepp and Steven Zaillian (who also wrote such films as SCHINDLER'S LIST, GANGS OF NEW YORK, and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER).    As I've said, the film is a bit muddled.  I wasn't quite clear on what was happening until about halfway through the film.  This didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the film, however; De Palma's directing and Cruise's acting pulled me through.  The film is especially fun during the thrilling ending, which includes some great special effects by ILM (STAR WARS creator George Lucas' effects company).    Though it has little in common with the show on which its based, Brian De Palma's adaptation of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is a fun, well-made thriller that is guaranteed to please action movie fans.  I can't, however, make the same guarantee for the casual moviegoer.
B000002LK1|5.0|It's probably safe to say that just about everybody has heard Personal Jesus.  That may be DM's most easily accesible pop hit.  The good news, though, is that this entire album is as good, and sometimes better.  Violator is chock full of incredible grooves and that familiar Depeche Mode mood that die-hard fans can't get enough of. <br /> <br />There's no need to beat a dead horse.  There have been numerous reviews extolling the virtues of this record.  If you're already a DM fan, you know all about Violator.  If you're not, Violator may very well be the best pick for a starting place to begin to appreciate the genius at work here. <br /> <br />Depeche Mode hit a similar peak of creative genius with their 1986 release Black Celebration, but it's Violator that truly cemented their position in the annals of music history.  While Black Celebration was gloriously dark and extremely textured, Violator seems like an effort to capture that same dark, brooding sound while stripping down the arrangements to a level that is much more easily digested.  I love Black Celebration at least as much as this album, but B.C. demands your full attention in order to truly appreciate the deep layers of sound.  Violator isn't so demanding, yet still captivates the listener with lush melodies and that sublime touch of Martin's guitar that leaves you always wanting just a bit more. <br /> <br />As I've read in other reviews, and I agree, Violator may be one of the top rock/pop/whatever albums of all time.  Halo may well be one of the best tunes ever penned by any artist. <br /> <br />It's an absolute must for any fan of the genre.
6304806426|3.0|This film is the greatest paradox that I have encountered in a theater to date. Regarding the photography, acting, directing, etc., yes, The English Patient excelled. Why, then, as I walked out of the theater did I so let down? Despite the excellence of many aspects of the film, one walks away with a very hollow feeling; what was the purpose of all of the emotional and physical suffering of the protagonists? It was hard to not dislike both of them. Frankly, the Italian nurse and the Indian bomb-squad soldier were far more interesting characters. After ten years, I still don't understand how the high-quality ingredients resulted in such a flat dish.
B000059TEP|5.0|I read once,\\"A true love is like a ghost.Everybody talks about it,but nobody has seen one.\\"I have never seen a ghost.This movie is a romantic ghost story that might help to cultivate some hopes to those who have lost their loved ones.Very thrilling,though,full of suspences,laughters and you'd never seen so much tears in other movies.<br />I wished my previous loved dog would return to Earth like Sam.<br />It's the most brilliant performance of Demi Moore.Whoopi Goldberg's interpretation is excellent,to me she's the most exciting GHOST of all.
078681859X|5.0|After Harry Potter opened up my eyes to the magic of the fantasy genre, I've been on the lookout for other books I'd enjoy.  I tried the likes of Tolkien (too serious and complicated for me) and Eoin Colfer (Artemis Fowl was too 'kiddie' for me) but didn't really find any that I enjoyed... until I discovered The Amulet of Samarkand.  The world of Bartimaeus drew me in, and his point of view as a djinni (read: slave to magicians) was very refreshing, not to mention hilarous!!!  I was laughing out loud so many times while reading it.  I already bought book 2 & 3 a few pages into the book, and it was so exciting I finished reading it in record time.  Jonathan Stroud is now one of my favorite authors! :)
B000EGCITG|5.0|OK, I'm a forty-something whose only brushes with modern pop culture are the few tracks I hear when my kids are listening to the radio.  One night I stumbled upon this punked out looking girl singing on TV and before I could change the channel I was struck by the strength and spirit of her vocals.  I've been a fan ever since.  I don't like the hip-hop type music, so there weren't many songs on her early releases I liked, but \\"Try This\\" was pretty good, and this one is amazing!!!  I love every single track! Several of the songs \\"who knew\\", \\"long way to happy\\", \\"nobody knows\\", and \\"dear Mr. President\\" almost bring me to tears when I hear them.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|These guys are something special.  Bought the EP -- played it constantly until the album came out and I'm turning on everyone I know to this great band from down under.  Comparisons schmarisons -- these guys are uniquely original and all their individual songs seem to have a life of their own.  There's not a subpar song on the album and if you play it once, you will want to hear it again and again and again. The songs (Dimension, Love Train, etc.) keep playing in my head.  And the Frazetta cover, totally tripindicular...
B000EULJLU|4.0|I am probably one of the biggest Tool fans out there.  But my favorites are still their first three albums.  Opiate is one of those rare cds where you just stick it in and push play.  Every song rocks and the same goes for Undertow(my all-time favorite).  I had a feeling that they were going to go back to their old roots with 10,000 Days, and have  mostly shorter songs, that were heavy and fast.  Instead it seems more like Lateralus Pt.2.  Each song is almost 10+ minutes and some of it is just(I hate to say this about my favorite metal band) well some of it is just boring.  I dont know maybe it would sound better if you were on some serious psychadelic drugs or something.  Anyway, I was a little dissapointed with this one as I was with Lateralus.  But, I bought the CD anyway just knowing that I couldnt go wrong with the packaging.  It was definatley worth every penny.  A booklet with some very cool 3-D pictures.  I dont know maybe when I see them perform these new songs live, I will appreciate them a little better.  I would still recommend buying this disc for the packaging and to support the greatest metal band of our generation.<br />Okay......May 10th, 2006.........I have been listening to this alot and I must say that it is really growing on me. I especially like Right In Two,Vicarious,and The Pot.  This disc is actually WAY better than Lateralus.  The lyrics are very deep and the music is beautifully layered.  I would actually give this a five star rating.  I'm still unsure about Viginiti Tres.  All I am hearing is one long note of feedback?  All in all essential TOOL.  I cant wait to see them live!!
1592401791|2.0|Emerick was the Beatles recording engineer 40 or so years ago and has decided to write a book on his experiences with them in the studio.  Thus, he can now be considered the 612th 5th Beatle.  He pretty much portrays Ringo as a shmuck who can't sing and who barely could play drums without Paul to hold his hand.  His opinion of George isn't much better, dissing his guitar playing as well as his somber personality.  Lennon is portrayed as a talented flake, but overrated in his impact on the group.  Paul is Geoff's boy, the true leader of the group, the one who gets things done.  I'm always skeptical of someone who waits until after the death of his subject (or one of them) to write about them.  Harrison and Lennon are not around to refute any of what our hero, the previously unknown Geoff, tells us.  I'd be curious to hear Ringo's opinion of the portrayal.  No doubt that Paul has no problems with the book since it is so sycophantic towards him.  Why did it take 40 years to write this book and how is the author able to remember, verbatim, thoughts that he had back than as a 19 year old?      The funniest aspect of the book is the author's delusional sense of equality of importance with the band.  He derides Lennon's technical proficiency, stating something to the effect:  \\"The musician is focused on the music, which is as it should be.  The sound engineer is focused on the sound, which is as it should be.\\"  The way he presents it is with equality of importance to the overall result.  Imagine an equipment manager on a football team writing a book on his experiences:  \\"Peyton Manning was focused on the quarterback position, which is as it should be, he had little understanding of how to properly pack up shoulder pads.  I on the other hand was focused on the gear, not understanding the various nuances of the quarterback position.  Together, somehow we made it work\\".
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is a terrific album and a real artistic evolution for Dave.<br /><br />Sadly, a lot of people have gotten caught up in the copy-protection issue.<br /><br />Firstly, you should all know that Sony BMG Music was sued for copy protection on albums like these. They are offering a settlement of 7.50 cents an album and a download of the music without protection or a new copy to anyone who fills out a claim form.<br /><br />Secondly, there is no complicated fix requiring you to go into your computer registry and delete system files. Instead, when you first insert the CD simply hold down the shift key. On a Windows Computer this disables auto-run applications and will work to make a copy of the music on this album for your portable devices.
B00003CXB6|5.0|I have read many reviews of this movie and got tired of the stupid reasons many people have to complain about this movie.  Most comments are so ridiculous, that you can easily tell they might have a deeper reason why to destroy this movie even though they know is good.  Well I hope this comments are read by the right people who are not brainless as many others.  THE MOVIE WAS FULL PACKED WITH ACTION.  THE 2 T-REX'S ATTACKING THE MAN IN THE CAR, IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY GREAT SCENES, THE STEGOSAURUS ATTACK, WAS SO GOOD, THE RAPTORS SCENES KEPT ME ATTACHED TO MY SEAT, SCENES ON THE CLIFF WERE SO GOOD, DINOSOURS LOOSED ALL OVER THE ISLAND WAS VERY INTENSE.  T-REX ON THE SAN DIEGO, ONE OF THE FAVORITE SEQUENCES FOR MANY PEOPLE.  MY FAVORITE SEQUENCES WERE ON THE ISLAND THOUGH.  THE MOVIE IS INTENSE AND FULL OF ACTION.  EXCELLENT SEQUEL IF NOT BETTER.  MAYBE SOME PEOPLE HAVE NOT NOTICED BUT ON THIS PAGE YOU CAN FIND THAT THE MOVIE WAS A TOTAL SUCCESS ON THE WHOLE WORLD WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, IT MADE $614 MILLIONS WORLD WIDE.  ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE MOVIE WAS NOMINATE FOR: <br /> <br />OSCAR: Best Effects, Visual Effects <br /> <br />SATURN AWARD:Best Director, Steven Spielberg; Best Fantasy Film; Best Performance by a Younger Actor/Actress, Vanessa Lee Chester; Best Special Effects, Best Supporting Actor, Pete Postlethwaite  <br /> <br />Blockbuster Entertainment Award: Favorite Actor - Sci-Fi <br />Jeff Goldblum; Favorite Actress - Sci-Fi, Julianne Moore  <br /> <br />Grammy Awards: Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television <br /> <br />BETWEEN MANY OTHERS, & 3 WONS.  AFTER THIS IS SAID, I'M VERY SURE SPIELBERG IS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS OF THIS SEQUEL.  AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THE MOVIE WAS MADE TO ENTERTAIN AND SATISFY ALL DINOSAURS LOVERS OUT THERE, AND IT DID.  THE IS JUST FORGETTING ONCE AGAIN, HOW TO WATCH A MOVIE, GET DISCONNECTED FROM FIRST PARTS, AND WATCH THE SEQUEL AS IF IT WAS A TOTAL NEW MOVIE, AND VALUE IT FOR WHAT IT IS, AND NOT FOR WAS IS SUPPOSED TO BE, BETTER THAN THE FIRST PART.  SEQUELS ARE NOT MADE TO OVERPASS THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST PART, THEY'RE MADE TO GIVE YOU MORE, OF WHAT THEY KNOW FOR SURE YOU ENJOY ON THE ORIGINAL MOVIE, BUT BECAUSE OF THE TIME ISSUE, WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE FIRST ONE.  GO GET THEM ALL 3 AND WATCH ALL AS IF IT WAS JUST ONE MOVIE, AND THEN THINK, IF IS REALLY BAD.  I KNOW FOR SURE THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, WHO SAW THE MOVIE AROUND THE WORLD, THOUGHT THE SAME I DID: EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!! <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|At first I was dissapointed by this album because it's not what I expected.  But after giving this album time I have fallen in love whith it.  This is not the Tool you heard on Lateralus, which wasn't the Tool you heard on Aenima, which wasn't the Tool you heard on Undertow, etc...  This album may be too progressive for some but it is a MASTERPIECE.  There are so many layers to this album.  I highly suggest listening through a great pair of headphones with an open mind.  You have to hear everything to appreciate its genius and you will not hear everything with just a cursory listen or blasting it while driving.<br /><br />P.S. please don't review this album until you have givin it an honest chance.  You WILL have that 'breakthrough' and have another perfect Tool album to add to your collection.  10,000 Days deserved 5 stars.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|Its not like I didn't already snap up most of the imports and singles these songs came on...making this collection cause for a little after-the-fact chagrin. <br /> <br />Either way, Lost Dogs, if taken as a double album, puts most double sets (usually vanity projects) to shame. It is full of good songs (Wash & Yellow Ledbetter being just two examples).  <br /> <br />The treasure here, however, is \\"Footsteps.\\" Anyone want to explain to me why this one was never released as a single? I'd wager money it'd have hit #1.  <br /> <br />Pearl Jam is now back with a vengeance with their self-titled album (not that they ever went anywhere). While you're listening to the new music, you might want to check out these songs as well. There's a lot here to enjoy--and its some of the best work they ever did.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The introduction sequence from \\"Serenity\\" manages to cover so much background from \\"Firefly\\" in about five minutes - and yet, it doesn't seem forced. What we're witnessing here is a brush of a master at work. <br /> <br />The rest of the movie doesn't disappoint, either. Joss Whedon's \\"Serenity\\" is \\"Firefly\\"'s bigger, rowdier brother. Created with a budget of $45 million dollars, instead of two spaceships, we get ... fifty. Instead of one planet, we get a few. Instead of one fighting sequence, we get several - wireless, grounded, physical, and much better choregraphed than fighting in Whedon's previous TV work. <br /> <br />But what about the characters, you may ask ? Do we feel the same way about them as we did in the TV series ? Or have they been converted to mindless automatons, overshadowed by special effects on the green screens behind them ? <br />Well, you can set your fears aside, friend. The characters from \\"Firefly\\" are fully intact - both with their flaws and the funny banter - some of which is surely to be missed the first time around. This is why you should buy the DVD ! <br /> <br />\\"Serenity\\" appears to be the final chapter on the universe established in \\"Firefly\\". Somber as that thought may be, we can only wish the same sort of big-screen treatment for all of the other TV shows that we have grown to love.
B00005JOIH|4.0|When I heard that a director of the caliber of Steven Speilberg was making a movie based on the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, I was very excited. I remember the events as they happened and I have read of the revenge operation that followed. When I saw the movie \\"Munich\\" however, I was a bit disappointed. For all of the hype surrounding the movie I was geared up for one of Speilberg's best. But I think it fell short. First of all, as the release date for the movie approached, I read several news items stating that he was   rushing to complete it. The rush to have it ready for Oscar consideration showed.  Secondly, I have always read that the Mossad was a very elite organization, known for it's effective and efficient ruthlessness. They were considered the best of the best when it comes to covert operations. This movie showed the \\"hit team\\" as being a collection of incompetent \\"wannabes\\".  Thirdly, with all of the sources now available for this subject, I am troubled that Speilberg relied on one book (\\"Vengeance\\" by George Jonas). In fact, I have read that former Mossad agents have roundly blasted the Jonas book as \\"inaccurate\\". These are just a few of my gripes. On the bright side, I thought that Eric Bana turned in a wonderful performance.  I liked the movie just as an action movie as long as I didn't think about it being \\"based on real events\\". All things considered, I give it 4 stars, mainly because Bana's acting kept it from being a 3.  I also read where the widows of some of the murdered athletes saw the movie and approved of it. If they approve of it, it can't be all bad. It's a decent movie that is worth a look. But I agree with one of the other reviewers who says that if you want a truly complete and \\"balanced\\" look at the Munich massacre, you are much better served by checking out the documentary \\"One Day in September\\".  Also, the History Channel has an excellent documentary on the Mossad and the Munich revenge operation.
B00005JOYA|5.0|This seems to be a love/hate thing, except I think a more appropriate label would be an understand it/don't understand it thing. <br /> <br />I hear some people saying the visuals are great but the acting and plot are shallow...  Funny, that's exactly how I feel about ALL the Star Wars movies, and those are considered classics (not to mention that the acting in Silent Hill is leagues above anything Lucas and Co. have released). <br /> <br />I'm a fan of the series and feel the first game is a timeless classic that deserves to be re-released in the future untouched-- the grainy graphics are part of the ride.  This movie depicts the town perfectly, taking most, if not all, of the key scenes in the first game and adapting them into the movie.   <br /> <br />The plot is just as undecipherable as it is in the games, but that's the point.  You're not supposed to walk out of the theater knowing what just happened-- just as gamers who finished the game weren't supposed to power off their Playstation having any idea what just happened.  You either appreciate that or you don't.  If it's not your thing, that's fine.  If you think it's crap, cool.  But please don't go tell a dozen people that Silent Hill is crap just because it's not your cup of tea.  I think Star Wars is crap... but I understand that for some people, it's a religion. <br /> <br />--And what's with all the Sean Bean bashing?  Sean Bean is a great actor.  He was excellent in Goldeneye, excellent in LOTR, and excellent in what little role he has in this movie.   <br /> <br />Some things I may have done differently: <br /> <br />I would have made the main character a male.  I feel the directors stuck a foot in horror movie cliche by making both main characters in this film young, attractive women.  This is NOT a \\"blond running from the serial killer\\" story, but on the surface it comes across that way. <br /> <br />I would have toned down a bit of the explanation segments.  I think the way they are is acceptable, but the plot isn't meant to be understood and, therefore, fifteen minutes of back-story is rather pointless. <br /> <br />I would have fleshed out Sean Bean's character because I think he's a great actor and deserved a more significant role.  Despite what some claim, his part in this movie is NOT pointless.  The scenes where Bean is in one reality and our heroine in the other adds an element to the story that the games didn't. <br /> <br />And, finally, I would have added a core to the plot.  The movie doesn't have much of one, and while this is intentional, I think a little bit more time could have been spent adapting the game to the big screen in terms of plot development. <br /> <br /> <br />I didn't direct the movie, though, and my complaints are minor.  I'm a fan of horror movies and you get much more bang for your buck with this than you do a good number of recent horror films, such as The Grudge, Dark Water, and Skeleton Key.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Though many may strongly disagree with me, as a veiwer watching this movie I got the sense that the filmmakers had in mind for Kong to be the villain, and that audiences siding with the woman-kidnapping, man-killing, train-wrecking, city-rampaging beast was a wholly unexpected and unintentional reaction.  <br /> <br />Before anyone denounces me, consider this: never once in the original movie (as directly opposed by both the 1976 and 2005 remakes,) do any of the human characters voice sympathy for Kong or talk about how wrong and tragic it is that they take him out of his natural habitat and take him to New York as a prisoner. The woman Ann does NOT fall in love with him, but instead remains terrified of him to the very end, and shows no saddness or regret for him either when he's captured or when he's killed at the end; rather, one gets the sense that she is in fact happy and relieved now that she no longer has to fear for him coming for her. The planes that shoot down Kong at the end seem much like the calvery flying in to save the damsel in distress at the end of the movie. True that Kong does save Ann on the island no less than three times from the dinosaurs, yet even though we're no doubt meant to cheer Kong on in those scenes since if he lost the other monsters would surely kill Ann, the film dosen't seem to ask us to side with him once Jack finds Ann and runs back with her to the natives' village, with Kong in hot pursuit, or at any point in the film beyond that. <br /> <br />Just based on the way the human characters in the film, including Ann, react to Kong even at the end, Kong in this original film seems to me more of a sympathetic villain rather than a hero. But that's just me.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|At first, upon hearing that Stadium Arcadium was a double disc, i was a little afraid. Often with double discs, one of them is not that good. This was a delightful surprise. both discs have their high and low points, making an overall good cd. Now onto the music.              First i just have to say that the guitar on this cd is, simply put, the best it has ever been. Thats not all. There is also plenty of great bass-led songs alongh the lines of Suck my kiss. My only complaint is that the RHCP did not evolve much from their previous cd's. This is not a problem at all, however. If YOu loved any of RHCP\\"S previous cds, then you will love this.     It has all of the elements that make their past work great and a lot more that will keep you listening for hours.   This cd is just full of srprises. On ones first listen one might skip over 20 of 28, then on their next, only 10 and by the 3rd, all the track are good (with the exception of 3 or 4). This, above all, is why you should buy Stadium Arcadium. This is a cd that will be good forver          the diversity of stlye on this cd will amaze both new and old RHCP fans alike
B000EMGAGW|5.0|I gave Mobb Deep 5 stars cuz I'm a fan, but I'll admit this is probably not their best piece of work. There's about a 5 good tracks on the cd, the thing I liked the most about the cd was that it had the \\"Outta Control Remix\\", cuz the beat is pretty tight. I was a lil bit up in the air about Mobb's move to G-Unit, personally I thought this cd would've been better cuz of the move, but I was wrong. Hopfully they can bounce back.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I didn't know how this one was going to be because the last cd that RHCP put out there was like only one good song on the cd. So I was looking at tv at the song Dani California came on tv. I said to myself well if the rest of cd sounds like this one it will be way good. Sure enfo I picked it up today and played both of the cds the whole way throw and you know what I was right. If you like old RHCP then pick up this one you will not go wrong with this one!
B000EULJLU|2.0|Disappointing.  As a longtime Tool fan I never thought I would say it but this album is a sleeper.  It is an example of what happens when you devote half of yourself to a project.  The album has a complete lack of momentum and energy.  It is more of a funeral procession (which may be their intent judging by the lyrics).  Even when the band gets energetic it merely sounds busy not intense.  There is a total lack of swing and movement to the riffs, which is something Tool's prior album have been exemplary at doing.  I know the band makes music for themselves, not to please the critics or the fans.  However, I believe putting the Tool name on this album is misleading to those looking for a Tool album.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I have never written an online review for anything before but I felt like this had to be done.  This album is Pearl Jam at its finest.  It's not so much a return to form as it is a compilation of fifteen years of playing together.  It gets you excited to hear rock again.  It has a passion that I personally feel lacked in the last few years.  Pearl Jam made about as perfect of an album as they come.  It's raw, it's melodic, its energetic and it has substance.  Eddie Vedder went back to his earlier form of writing by using storytelling in his lyrics.  It's a musical ride.  Just get it.  Even if you haven't picked up a Pearl Jam album since you had a flannel shirt tied around your waist in high school...just get it.
B000059XUO|3.0|Very dark, very violent, stylized film, somewhat on the order of \\"Batman\\", but no lightness anywhere.  Premise is dead man comes back to life to avenge lover's death.  Blood and gore and shootings run rampant.  Brandon Lee was good - kind've reminded me of Johnny Depp.  And the head bad guy was very good, with a marvelously raspy bass voice.  But after having seen within a few days \\"Natural Born Killers\\", a rescreening of \\"Robocop\\" and now this, I cannot help but be struck by our society's penchant for being entertained by gore and bloody violence, in many cases quite sick.  I see no difference between this movie gore and the Roman gladiators performing for the populace.  Sure, in the arena men died, and all on the screen is make-believe, but the visuals are  the same.  We are impacted with the same sights and sounds, perhaps worse.  Why do human beings find this entertaining?  This is not new either; people used to love boxing, seeing a boxer's face get smashed to pulp.  Because it's not them?
0066620996|4.0|This management book has proven to be a hit among business professionals. It is easy to read, and covers a lot of material between its covers. The message I got from it is that to strategize is good. And if you fine tune your strategy enough you might grow your company from being merely good to becoming great.<br /><br />I would have liked the book better if it pointed out that many people try to fine-tune their businesses, but fail at creating great companies. Luck is an element of business that probably deserved its own chapter in this book. Unfortunately it was left out.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that no company stays great. What goes up must eventually come down. This book is about striving to get the company to go up. 4 stars!
B0006399FS|3.0|\\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is one of those albums that, aside from the popular songs, really doesn't have that much to offer.  If the whole album were filled with songs like \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"All Because of You\\", it would be a classic. Unfortunately, many of the songs lack the heart and soul as once heard in such albums as \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"Zooropa\\".  Lyrically, it has many more spiritual references, which is good; however, musically, it's really bland.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|So I heard Franz Ferdinand when I was in France in 2004.  Some fellow travellers from Australia said \\"...hey, these guys rock..\\" and I became an instant fan.  This makes up for the years of alternative rock that was...well, craptastic. <br /> <br />Fav tracks include Dark of the Matinee and Take Me Out. <br /> <br />Aussie Aussie Aussie!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 Days was definitely a little lack luster the first time through.  After a few listens from beginning to end, it really evolves into a masterpiece.  I read a review about lousy artwork, which is by far not true.  The packaging the cd comes in is amazing, evolving just like their music.  The glasses included on the cd cover create a tripped out 3D experience when viewed correctly (think Magic Eye but with clear pictures).  It does always seem after so much time, Tool should be releasing double albums, but it shows in the production and completeness of the songs the time put into the cd.  I wish i could fast forward to 5 years from now to hear the next installment.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|As a fan of the original game, I felt compelled to inform other fans about my opinions regarding this movie, as reviews for this movie seem overly positive.  First of all, let me say that I played, played, and replayed FFVII at the age of 17 when it was first released for the PC. I appreciated a lot of things about the game but what I liked most was the storyline, and how it resembled a classic mythological tale.  I heard information about the movie's development a long time ago, saw the various trailers, and was very excited and waited in anticipation for the release date, which was delayed time and time again.<br /><br />On the movie itself, there are two areas where this movie truly excels: action, and visuals. When it comes to action this movie certainly doesn't disappoint. The classic FFVII fight music plays for many of the battles (nostalgic for some, predictable for others) and swords clash with amazing speed. The visuals are also truly stunning. I've always appreciated the animation style of SquareSoft and particularly enjoyed a realistic rendition of these mainly androgynous Caucasian cartoon characters.<br /><br />Aside from the ludicrous and hard-to-follow fight scenes, there was very little else to hold the movie together. It was very difficult to tell what was going on in the movie, even for a person that studied the mythological structure of FFVII. The lines were dry and consisted mostly of dramatic exclamation of character's names. Add that to the bad English voice acting and it's almost unbearable.<br /><br />The edits in this movie needed serious work. If you're a sugar-pumped teenager with ADD you might call the edits fast-paced. If you're not, they're choppy, underdeveloped, and agonizingly jarring. I don't always need to see a different camera angle every two seconds, and would prefer more time to take in all the imagery that I'm being presented with.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this film deserved two stars because while its visuals and nostalgic value may be it's only saving grace, they are nevertheless secondary to plotline and pacing, which were in serious short supply.<br /><br />Maybe I'm getting old. Maybe my taste for film has refined some since I was 17. Maybe this movie's not meant for mature audiences. If so please disregard my review and purchase this movie. However, if you are considering purchasing this movie and are over the age of 20, please take my review to heart before making this purchase.and nostalgic value may be it's only saving grace, they are nevertheless secondary to plotline and pacing, which were in serious short supply.  <br /> <br />Maybe I'm getting old.

B00006IU73|4.0|In Absentia is one of those records that you instantly enjoy.  The music is all around brilliantly orchestrated and there are no fillers (gotta love some instrumental songs).  I really think that Steven Wilson is one of the best musicians out there today. \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" & \\"The Creator Has a Mastertape\\" are among personal favorites. I suggest anyone who enjoys this album also check out the band's second c.d \\"Up The Downstair\\", it's amazing as well.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|It seems the only difference between punk and pop is the type of people acting like whiny pricks about it on the internet... oh wait, never mind. Despite display of a pitch-perfect ear for pop melody and use of a style that defies categorization by the faux-hawkers and club junkies who claim to hate it, \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is rock in a hard place (the apparent line between pop and punk) and it's about as devisive to the public at large as a Good Charlotte record as a result. <br /> <br />Whatever you think of either of those genres, if you truly have an open ear for music, Panic! At the Disco deliver an interesting listen with their debut, fusing dance and club electronica of satire-caliber bluntness to the high tempos, blaring guitar chords, and endearing imperfections expected of a band raised by DIY punk rockers. Even if it means getting a record deal from a pit of damnation as reprehensible as MySpace, do it yourself. And stop whining without a microphone. <br /> <br />\\"The Only Difference\\" is a zippity-do-da-in-hell rave-up, with a right hook power chorus that makes for easiest visualization of the band's namesake. Just try not dancing to it, or at the very least not tapping your foot and/or snapping fingers as the opening bars suggest. The house techno bridge will kick in at exactly the same time as the ecstasy. <br /> <br />On the other end of the spectrum, \\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies,\\" an amusing inner monologue of a man scorned, opens with pizzicato strings and cello, but quickly turns around into another thudding head-bobber, while still using the cello and strings. Hey, it worked for Cursive. Why not these guys? <br /> <br />No, they're not perfect. Like any magician's act, once you know the tricks, \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" has potential to get tired in a hurry, and the smarmy lyrics can strike a nerve in the out-of-mood listener. And then there's the crop of people, the existence of whom I shall blame upon the band (and their work), who never bother to listen to the message being pounded into the ground over the course of a record, who love Panic! At the Disco because \\"the lead singer is so hot.\\" <br /> <br />But the fact remains: Panic! as songwriters are head and shoulders more clever than spiritual partners Good Charlotte and the Bloodhound Gang -- a song like \\"London Beckoned\\" can be interpreted as a confessional statement of purpose, or bleedingly sarcastic, depending on taste. And their music manages to be much easier to stomach than either of those aforementioned groups by virtue of varied instrumentation and a ear for melody with a much greater frequency response. If they're too pop for you, try Neon Blonde or the Blood Brothers. If they're too punk, congratulations on branching out from Ashlee Simpson. We'll see you on the other side.
B000002GYR|5.0|Tom Waits have always reminded me of Neil Young.  He either puts out a great album or it reminds you of getting a root canel.  Closing time is one of the great ones.  Listening to it is like sitting in a bar crying over your beer while a guy sitting at a piano with a couple of his buddies play in the the back corner. It a shame he have lost sight of the fact that this is what he is good at.  Simply songs with a heart felt message or story.
0895260131|1.0|The Quaran is very complex, and is interpreted wrongly more times than not. If one is not an EXPERT on the quarun, the TRUE meaning of the quaran in arabic AND THE REAL FACTS ABOUT PROPHET MOHAMMED'S (peace be apon him) LIFE AND CHARACTER, then one should shut their ignorant mouths (no offence).This book sugests that Mohemmed (peace be apon him) was evil! Is this the same Mohemmed who condemed his followers for burning down a church and rebuilt it? I do not pretent to be an expert, but i also know that the author of this book and those that have written +ive reviews certainly are not. Ignorance like this is what is the cause of evil in the world and the cause of any muslims, christians, jews or any other human commiting unjust attrocities. Surely the sheer stupidity of this book is immediatly highlighted in its summery! To critize islam, the quarun and Mohammed (peace be apon him)using those 'muslims' past and present who have wrongly interpreted it (as this book does) or used it as a tool for power and commited atrocious crimes, as evidence is ridiculous. Humans from all faiths and races have done equally bads things. How stupid would it be to hold the holacaust agaist all germans forever. This book is up there with Hitlers 'Mein Kamph'!
B0000027D5|3.0|This album shows what Mr. Santana does very well.  Play the quitar.  The problem is that it only works half the time.  When it flows the riffs are great.  The problem is that there are parts here, usually at the beginning of songs where the feedback and high pitchs sounds, just breaks the mood.  It is usally very easy to get sucked into the sounds as the melody takes you places few others can.  The problem it does not last.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Aeon Flux is a live-action adaptation of the critically-lauded animated T.V. show by Peter Chung. This movie was something of a gamble as the show only managed to spawn a small, but dedicated cult following. Now, comes along a big budget movie starring Charlize Theron as the eponoymous protagonist. Unfortunately, the show's creator had no input into the movie which only further alienates it from the fan base. However, I think fans will be pleasantly surprised at just how faithful the movie is to the show.<br /><br />Charlize Theron certainly has Aeon's emotionless attitude down cold and is more than up for her character's athleticism. It is an extremely physically demanding role that she is more than capable of, showing an impressive prowess. However, Marton Csokas is miscast as Trevor. He doesn't look like his animated counterpart nor does he act like him - a lecherous powermonger. Csokas goes in the opposite direction as a quietly confident leader.<br /><br />This film has top notch production design and special effects with well-choreographed action sequences often accompanied by the requisite techno music. The sterile, futuristic look, flashy martial arts and Orwellian society is reminiscent of Equilibrium, although its action sequences were much better as was its kinetic editing - something that this movie could have used more of. In an interesting twist, all of this society's top assassins are women and, like in the Kill Bill movies, there are ferocious fight scenes between highly trained and very dangerous women, each with their own unique skills.<br /><br />The animated series was a fantastic example of abstract sci-fi surrealism and to capture that in a live-action movie is a difficult task to say the least. The film tries to have it both ways. It's not quite abstract as it should be and is not as pedestrian as it could have been. Watching this movie, it's easy to see why it failed to capture a mainstream audience. It's too abstract for most and not abstract enough for the show's fans, leaving it in an odd state of limbo.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Charlize Theron and the film's producer Gale Anne Hurd. Theron talks about the challenges of the intense, physical training she underwent for this role and then Hurd, in turn, praises her physical prowess. This is fairly decent track and both commentators are engaging.<br /><br />Also included is a commentary by the film's screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. They point out connections between the film and the animated series. They also talk about how much exposition was needed to set up this world and how the challenge is to tell enough but not to overwhelm or bore the audience.<br /><br />\\"Creating a World: Aeon Flux\\" examines the challenge of adapting an experimental, non-narrative cartoon into a Hollywood movie. We see Peter Chung visiting the set and marveling at his drawings being brought to life.<br /><br />\\"The Locations of Aeon Flux.\\" Kusama originally wanted to shoot in Brasilia because it had an ideal, futuristic look that was surrounded by jungle. It wasn't practical for them to shoot there so Berlin was their next choice because it also had futuristic looking architecture.<br /><br />\\"The Stunts of Aeon Flux.\\" Charlize Theron trained hard for this role. She came from a dancing background so she was very flexible - an ideal attribute for her character. It's amazing to see the level of commitment she had for this movie and the fact that she did 95% of her own stunts!<br /><br />\\"The Costume Design Workshop of Aeon Flux\\" takes a look at how the film's many costumes were designed and then made. They took their inspiration from the film The Conformist (1970).<br /><br />\\"The Craft of the Set Photographer on Aeon Flux.\\" He took pictures on the set for publicity stills and sometimes even for the film's poster.

B00005JMXX|1.0|the movie is scientifically inaccurate and loaded w/ politics and biased point or views
B000805796|5.0|I am very puzzled by any negative reviews of this album.  It is an excellent collection of songs that this reviewer would certainly rather hear on the radio than the garbage passed off as \\"American pop music\\" today.  The songs rock.  This album, along with Emma Bunton's \\"Free Me\\" and Geri Halliwell's \\"Passion,\\" marks 2005 for me as the year of the solo Spice Girls.
0385504209|4.0|Starting off the book grabs and holds your attention from page to page. I'm not certain how accurate the historical accounts are but regardless of that the book is great and it keeps you enthralled through all of its twist and turns. I give 4 stars for the book alone. The historical references though, I ve' heard not all are accurate.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|Nothing caught my attention on this album...Even Dani Cal is just OK. The Peppers mellowed some in their previous album (which still sounded great!), but this one takes it to the nth degree and is a complete sleepfest. They've lost that edge. <br /> <br />I really regret not previewing it first (something I never had to do with their previous albums). <br /> <br />I should have realized the songs they were going to be making when they added those two extras in their 'Greatest Hits' (Fortune Faded, Save the Population) which bombed.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|This film finds its best moments in the opening credits, before the title \\"Hostel\\" ever hits the screen.  After that point, it is a quagmire of useless, non-relevent, sex-scenes and expressions of drug use.  After trudging through the first half of the movie, dealing with unrelated mentionings about the female anatomy, one hopes the movie will reach a higher standard and show the horror that was promised.  The only horror here, is the filmaking itself.  While the premise behind the movie is an interesting idea, the filmaker seemed too busy with style over imagery and symbolism over substance.  The film never scares the viewer.  It even falls short of being anything disturbing.  A true waste.
B000EGCITG|4.0|I loved Missundaztood.  I loved Can't Take Me Home.  Not impressed with Try This.  She's Not Dead is great!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This album (and Muse for that matter) flirts with the line of overblowness and lame-ness.  This gives Muse an emotional edge that makes their music more exicting than most; and with their talent and exceptional live performances a great band is created. I also love the fact that their lyrics can be both cryptic and straighforward.  For some it comes across as lame but for me it is perfect.    2. Apocalypse Please - A powerful beginning of the album with forceful piano and drum playing. Very dramatic that might be commenting that world leaders are \\"asking\\" for apocalypse with all the wars and fighting.  7.6/10    3. Time Is Running Out - One of the songs that introduced me to Muse.  A lot of synth noises and snaps make this song the pop-iest song on the album. Its either about a secret government organization or about a relationship, you make the call. Awesomely catchy song.  10/10 (one of three songs I would give a ten)  4. Sing For Absolution - Nice piano intro that progresses into a haunting song driven by vocals and a drum beat. It sounds like pleading for absolution as the end of the world comes. Beautiful song.  8.3/10    5. Stockholm Syndrome - A pretty heavy song. On a list of best guitar rifts ever the one in Stockholm Syndrome was voted #1.  The piano comes in during the chorus as the sound floats you away at high speeds. When Matt sings \\"Forget you, I wish I could!\\" I am always amazed. Probably applying the idea of Stockholm Syndrome to a relationship. Best song ever, you must experience it live.  10/10 (only third song I have currently given the title of perfection)    6. Falling Away With You - A soft acoustic song, that only picks up a little. A beautiful song that doesnt quite do it for me. About slowly drifting away from the other person in the relationship and not regreting it.  7.0/10    8. Hysteria - A heavy rocker with a very gothic sound.  I love the bass playing in this song.  The intro-riff is probably my favorite. The song has an awesome guitar solo. A very straightforward meaning of breaking down while \\"wanting\\" someone.  9.1/10    9. Blackout - A very peaceful and simple song that utilizes orchestra sounds. It is very focused on lyrics, it is about people not realizing the greatness of their youth until they are too old. Or maybe about a relationship that is just too good. It bores me a little but is amazingly peaceful.  7.4/10    10. Butterflies And Hurricanes - A song with many varied sound but has the air of importance. It has an interlude of a classical piece of Rocmaninoff (not sure how you spell it). This is the definition of an epic song. Many interpretations are possible but I believe this is saying that the end of the world is near and each person must step up to stop it.  8.5/10    11. The Small Print - Straight up rock song with a touch of dramatic-ness. A song that you want to sing along to but it is difficult to. The song is probably about someone selling their soul to the Devil.  It ranks in the upper-level of Muse songs.  8.9/10    12. Endlessly - Another soft song about loving someone unconditionally with little hope of them ever knowing. A very simple song.  8.0/10    13. Thoughts Of A Dying Atheist - A pretty standard song, with a little to much repition. About an atheist fearing death.  7.0/10    14. Ruled By Secrecy - A simple song with the feel of mystery.  Has a nice build-up at the end. Obviously has the idea of secrecy but a very complex idea for a song. Maybe one of Muse's most beautiful songs.  7.5/10    Final Note: Best album ever = 10/10 (only album I would give a 10). I recommend Muse to all people.
6304696558|4.0|Goldie Hawn in arguably one of her best films (certainly one of her greatest performances of the 80's).<br /><br />PRIVATE BENJAMIN is the story of a \\"Jewish princess\\" called Judy Benjamin (Goldie Hawn), whose new husband expires on the honeymoon.  With very little on the horizon, she rashly  decides to enter the army, but comes under the wrath of tyrannical Captain Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan in an Oscar-nominated performance, and later a short-lived television sitcom spin-off).<br /><br />A classic \\"fish out of water\\" story, produced by Hawn and largely-tailored to her comedy talents.<br /><br />An amazing supporting cast too, with Armand Assante, Sam Wanamaker, Mary Kay Place, Albert Brooks, P.J. Soles, Craig T. Nelson, Barbara Barrie, Harry Dean Stanton, Gretchen Wyler and Sally Kirkland.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|This is a beautiful album rivaling Absolution.  A bit more screaming and unintelligible language on this album put it slightly below Absolution.  Matt Bellamy's voice continues to make the songs beautiful no matter the type.  This album seems a little more dramatic than Absolution but there is nothing wrong with it. Muse continues in this album to be very dark and sometimes emotional with their dramatic style.    1. New Born - Another epic Muse song that starts out with synth noises and keybord going opposite to each other, eventually the guitar starts up and this song really takes off (like a rocket ship), a truely great Muse song. It might be about the losing of innocence.  9.7/10    2. Bliss - A crescendo song with the electric piano that remains in the background. I love the vocals in this fairly simple song. It might be about thinking God is too perfect.  8.9/10    3. Space Dementia - Starts out with a piano intro and it is driven by the piano. It eventually get a little funky. I dont exactly love the vocals in this song and it is very average for Muse.  7.3/10    4. Hyper Music - Extremely cool intro and very dramatic vocals power this song. It is pretty obvious what this song means and it is very powerful.  7.8/10    5. Plug In Baby - Great song that really features Matt's guitar playing. On a list of greatest guitar rifts ever this song makes the top 20. It is pretty awesome song to sing along to and feel the emotion, even though I dont really understand its meaning.  9.0/10    6. Citizen Erased - This song is fairly simple but is an emotional rollercoaster ride.  It is a little anti-climatic but how could you not love this song. \\"For one moment, I wish you'd hold your stage with no feelings at all.\\"  8.5/10    7. Micro Cuts - A pretty cool song with a lot of hatred. I wish I could understand what he was saying, so this is much better live.  7.5/10    8. Screenager - The only track I would consider skipping. It is just plain boring. A beautiful song that might be about harming ones self.  7.0/10    9. Darkshines - The piano really hits you hard but the effect of this wears off eventually. A pretty good song.  8.1/10    10. Feeling Good - A cover song (dont remember by who).  I love how this song progresses into \\"freedom is my lie.\\" Seems as if it is about a phoney sense of happiness.  8.8/10    11. Megalomania - A haunting spacy feeling song that uses a pipe organ.  7.3/10      Overall 9.7/10 While these songs might be more strange than Absolution there is not a glaringly weak track on this album.  It was an overall good and varied effort if not a bit overdramatic.

It's GREAT! My parents love it....I love it! I never grow tired of just letting the CD loop for hours on end. This is a great CD that you can't help but sway your head & hum along to. Makes you reminiscent of carefree days, even if you're too young to remember the crooner days of ole'.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Danger Mouse has now proven that he will be the most influential producer of the initial part of the 21st century, and definitely will hold a position in the greatest producers and artists of all time. No one foresaw his rise to fame through the bootleg 'Grey Album' that burst on the scene in 2004. Gnarls Barkley is the collaboration that proves the consistency of his talent and artistic flare. <br />The first single, \\"Crazy\\", combines the retroactive styles of Al Green-esque R&B with the modern stylings of Danger Mouse and Goodie Mod's Cee-lo Green. It has been long in coming that discoesque music should return to the fore-front of American music. The rest of the record is a well-produced, and similarly styled, collection of tracks. Though this may seem a little too stereotyped, the album truly transcends genres- combining, mixing, matching, cutting, re-appropriating...all these words may seem fit to describe the record, but it should be distilled into one word: perfection.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Every metal band there ever was (or will be) wished this album was to their credit ... this is THE DEFINITIVE metal album of all time - gutteral, raw, powerful, thumping, grinding, screaming, heavy! This makes brilliant bands like Maiden, Scorpions, Schenker, Priest et al look like amateurs! Once you finally get this album out of your player,try its predecessor \\"Reckless and Wild\\" and listen to the origin of thrash in the song \\"Fast As A Shark\\" and then pick up a more recent album \\"Death Row\\" cause those 2 albums on top of \\"Balls To The Wall\\" will ensure you have the best of the best in your metal collection.
B000ENV2P0|5.0|Wow I got my copy this morning, and this is the most musical album of all time!! If this doesn't win a grammy for Best Album, then I have lost faith in NARAS.. <br /> <br />Thank you John, Anthony, Chad, and Flea for all the good vibrations, musical harmonies, thunderous solos, and good times that are found on this album of a lifetime..
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I normally lisen to death metal, black metal, and the likes of a more hardcore sound, but i started lisening to the beetles about 3 months ago, and they are by far the best band ever to come along, With out even putting any real effort forward they produced spectaular songs that are not included in this recording because, lets face it, since when does the general public having a f***n clue about good music, if it ain't catching don't lisen, right, well with out that mind set, we probally wouldn't be constently plagued by the uneduated urban folk and their rap music,
0783225725|5.0|with those lines \\"stranger\\" settles the name game quickly. this is clint's second movie as director and his first try at a western. once again he shows he is equal to the task. <br />  a stranger rides out of the desert into the town of lago and in less than 5 mins. is attacked and kills 3 men.after that the townspeople ask him to protect them from outlaws getting out of jail and coming to the town for revenge.how he protects the town and who he is (or was) makes for a very sharp western myth at its best. <br />  no real extras(trailer and production notes), but film looks good,clear good sound,and even gives you both widescreen and pan and scan! very good disc
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Well, I've been a fan of Pearl Jam's music since \\"Ten\\" came out back in the day, when I was in junior high. Their music has kind of been a soundtrack for my life, considering that they're the only band form back then that's still together and making records - kick ass records, at that. And, at the risk of sounding repetitive in light of all reviews and comments, their giving the finger to MTV and the like while continuing to tour worldwide and make excellent music is no small matter in today's music scene, where even rock bands (or what sadly passes for rock bands) have short expiration dates and focus on their looks rather than their music, pretty much like it was back in the 80's in LA.    Please note that I stress the fact that I'm a fan of the MUSIC and not necessarily the band. I think that's a distinction that you have to make in order no to fall into moronic stances like \\"So-And-So doesn't support Dubya, so he's a commie and his music sucks\\", which is a common thread in most bad reviews I read in this website for all sorts of musicians. One has to be able to separate the artist from the art and judge it on its own merits. Just because I used to think Jeff Ament was a dork who dressed like Marky Mark, it didn't mean I couldn't appreciate his work as a graphic designer for the band or his contributions as a songwriter (Jeremy and Otherside come to mind). Likewise, just because I think Lindsay Lohan is hot, it doesn't mean I'll buy her sucky records or go to her lame concerts. Or even watch her stupid movies. See my point?    As for those complaining that this record is no \\"Ten\\" or \\"VS\\"...well, no record is. \\"The Black Album\\" is no \\"Master of Puppets\\", and \\"St. Anger\\" is certainly no \\"Black Album\\". Again, judge this disc - any disc - on its own merits.    Also, I really don't understand people who post \\"how much this-or-that\\" sucks \\"like always\\". If you don't like any record by a certain band,I just don't see why you'd go to the trouble of posting a review for one of their albums. That's an opinion as useless as that of the super fan who forgives everything a band does and loves even their lamest work. (And no, I'm not one of those, there are some PJ songs I loathe).    Well, after rambling for a bit, here's what I think of this album, in a nutshell: this is a really good and solid record with a few great songs and some passable ones, and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy good rock & roll. Period.
0792163710|5.0|if you love westerns(and you must if your looking at this)then this is one movie that you must have in your collection. never before or after was alan ladd asc good as he is here. his shane wants to stop wandering and wants to settle down. he finds a homesteder in need of help and sets out to work for him. the ranchesr in the area want the farmers out and have hired a very nasty killer(jack palance in an oscar nomatited role,just dripping venom at every few words he speaks) so before long shane must strap on the guns again. as a counter to all this we get brandon de wilde as the little boy who thinks shane is so cool, even more cool than his father. this is a great one and is a must for your collection!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|After \\"By the Way\\" in 2002 I joked with a couple friends that I wouldn't expect much more out of the Peppers, only because that record--along with \\"Californication\\"--were so good that topping them seemed unlikely.  But Anthony, Chad, Flea and John have proven me wrong.  \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is, arguably, their career best, and it's certainly the best collection of new studio tracks by any presently active pop-rock band in years.  With 28 new studio tracks (priced at one CD) that rock the gamut from funk to folk, dirty metal to jangly pop, superlative guitar and bass performances by John (who scorches here) and Flea (God of the bottom end), WB is practically giving away this wonderful music.  \\"SA\\" is also the group's most vocal record, with heavy harmonies lending a lustrous gloss to most of the tracks.  It's nearly impossible to resist boppin' and singing along.  This is certainly the record of the summer, the year, and quite probably the decade.  The talent in this band puts others to shame.  This music will likely embarass Dave Mathews, Pearl Jam, Radiohead, Coldplay, and other music fashionables who simply can't rise to this level of virtuosity and songcraft.  And somewhere in Dublin, U2s Bono is muttering \\"You sunk my battleship.\\"
B00006RCOB|3.0|remember when the russians were the bad guys of the world and we were always close to an all out nuke exchange with them? well this is from that time. <br />  the story is pre stelth plane about nam pilot gant(eastwood looking very out of place and very uncomfortable) is \\"taped\\" to help steal the russians new fighter plane the \\"firefox\\" because it can't be seen by rader and has a thought control weapons system. the reason that they pick clint(they make him one of the \\"unadjusted\\" pilots who can't forget the horror of nam,hum,where have i seen that before?)is because he speaks and \\"can think in russian\\"(whatever that means) and he fits the flight suit!!!!! honest i didn't make this up! <br />the whole point of the movie is to get clint in the planebut over 2/3's of the movie goes by before we even get close to the plane. <br />clint doesn't seem to feel comfortable in this movie even though he directed it. once we get in the air the movie moves up to really exciteing,but it's to little to late as the movie feels like it goes on forever. the f/x are great and it was a nice try but not clint's best movie.
0064409422|4.0|C.S. Lewis strikes again he is such a amazing writer,in which he writes The Chronicles of Narnia Series, This Review is on \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\\" It is such an exciting, emotional,and a very detalied magical story.  It's described with such beautiful imagery, cool battles, and sacrifice, the story even though its an exciting book it is a really childish book. This book reminds me of how me and my sister used to pretend we can fly and go in different worlds and fight monsters. It really had alot of imagination, which actually had me sit down and think of how cool it would actually be if in real life we were able to. I got really into this book, i give it an A!!!  <br /> <br />
B00004U28G|1.0|Wow,is the world so starved for chase movies that is mindless junk is sen as a great movie. if you like chase or race movies  get \\"cannonball\\" or \\"the gumball rally\\" instead. this is just one long mug at the camera by burt and friends with the one scene that is in every burt movie where he gets dramitac for a second and tells the reason he is like he is.(it was used to good effect in the longest yard,was ok in smokey and the bandit,and reached it's worst in this movie and stroker ace) <br />    burt moans all the time in interviews that he's not taken serious as an actor,well movies like this is the reason why,he doesn't act he just mugs for the camera and smiles,it takes more than that to be thought of as a great actor.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've listened to this non-stop for the last week, and haven't been disappointed by it for a second. Like Lateralus, it's an album that's better listened to as an album than by trying to pull singles off of it. Tool is the best band currently in the business in this regard, and the only band that's capable of putting out albums that sell themselves better as a package deal (like Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\") than as a modern hit-band putting out radio friendly singles. <br /> <br />I don't agree that there is any \\"filler\\" on the album at all; it has an ebb and flow of highs and lows like any good album should. If anything it's going to fall victim to impatience and overhype by people too eager to force it into some kind of five year payoff. It's not A Perfect Circle, and it's not Lateralus 2. <br /> <br />Given a chance, it stands on its own perfectly and is a brilliant album filled with emotion and feeling. 5 stars.
6304698682|4.0|i got to see this one in the theater with a big crowd and it was the best.sure it's \\"shane\\" with miners but it is still good to have clint back in the saddle. <br />  the plot(what there is of it)has the independent miners of lahood tring to get alone as a big mine company tries to squeese them out. the daughter of one of them prays for help,and in rides clint(think high plains drifter)as preacher,his only name. well after he gets there the days of the evil mine company are numbered. <br /> like i said not clint at his best,the action feels forced,and clint looks uncomfortable at times. still i give it 4 stars because clint in the saddle is a sight to behold!!!!
B000067IZ3|5.0|Bold and transcendent movie that literally broke the walls of a delicate, awful and overlooked issue, that day after day corrodes the entrails of the modern societies all over the world.<br /><br />Tense drama that will shock you from the first shot. The trilogy conformed by this picture, Requiem for a dream, and more recently, Mary full of grace are not a mere product of casualty.<br /><br />Powerful, merciless, cruel and struggling script that will beat in the family of a devoted ferocious prosecutor who combats this awful lash.<br /><br />Filmed in sepia tonality to accent still more the dramatis personae. Special mention to Benicio del Toro for this celebrated performance.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This film was the best full-length feature film with spectacular CGI!!  I couldn't believe my eyes when i saw the trailers on TV.  Me personally, it was 10 times better than \\"Spirits Within.\\"  A much better story and characters.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Ok, let's \\"cut to the chase\\" (rim shot please). Was it not for the fact that I'm so attached to Moving Pictures for all the obvious reasons (great songs; 25 years of saturation, etc.) I just might rank 1993's Counterparts as my favorite Rush album. Time and resonance are the only things working against that and not by much, I might add. But even those things aside, it just might be the BEST record in their catalog from top to bottom. (And considering that it's a lengthy 11 songs long - by Rush's usually brief song selection history that is - that says even more). <br /> <br />I'm going to get the stuff I didn't like out of the way first. <br /> <br />Ok, there. That's pretty much it. GOODNIGHT CLEVELAND..! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Really, I can't peg an appreciable or mentionable weak spot without lying to myself or digging into the ridiculous minutia. <br /> <br />Oh, sure...I like some songs better than others, naturally, but I must say there isn't a skip-worthy one in the bunch. Whereas previous albums (and I just did a trio of listens, from Presto to Counterparts this morning) have their share of filler, some more irksome than others but all still usually quite listenable, Counterparts didn't have a single song that I wouldn't have considered a top 5 song on most other records since and including Moving Pictures. I hesitate to say Between Sun & Moon, Alien Shore, and The Speed Of Love qualify, because I'm afraid that automatically implies something less-than-good. But moreso than maybe any other Rush record, these \\"weakest\\" tunes are very, very good and would be in the top third on most albums after 1981.  <br /> <br />The album is full of life and vitality....from the two most accessible songs Animate and Cold Fire (both excellent...and yeah, nice ride on the ride, Neil), to the poignancy of Nobody's Hero and Everyday Glory....from the playful, noodling magnificence of Leave That Thing Alone to the equally dorky-cool of Double Agent....and from the gritty guitars of Cut To The Chase to the heavy killer sound on Stick It Out. <br /> <br />It's also the best production job since Permanent Waves. Even the remasters of Roll The Bones and Presto still have a muted (even if improved) tone to `em, but Counterparts is bassy and full. Really loud record. It will be the next upgrade (over the CD-R I have) I purchase for sure. <br /> <br />Some observations: <br /> <br />1. Best lyrical effort on record by Peart...at least up to this point in the catalog. Lots of websites and fan reviews have actually criticized the content of the lyrics, but I think it's done well. Afterall, Counterparts has a relationship theme....a thread that extends from lyrics to the album title and cover imagery.  <br />2. Nice throw back to the 2112 era riffage in Double Agent....old school with a voice over twist. <br />3. Stick It Out is easily the heaviest Rush tune ever. Love this song and its ass-blistering energy. <br />4. Nobody's Hero is a crowning achievement for the band. That some fans ridicule this song is beyond me. <br />5. Geddy is in fine form here as well. I love the fine touches in background vocals throughout. Seems a little extra time was spent here and I think it shows. <br />6. While the keys are noticeable reduced on this record, I think some fans mistakenly jump to that as a major player as to why this record is an improvement over recent albums. While it's true that there's more guitar at work here, clearly the difference is in the songwriting...and the sustained energy. I think that has more to do with writing and arranging than purely instrumentation. No snoozers here. <br /> <br />I'm to understand that a bit of a lull is in store for me on the next record I review...(I still haven't listened to a single note of Test For Echo)...and that's probably quite true regardless of what I think of the album. And that's because topping Counterparts is likely to be a dubious (and arguably impossible) task. It may or may not happen again in their career. But either way it's quite encouraging to see a band who always seems to make very good records occasionally kick out the excellent piece. They did it in '80 and '81...then again in '84....and again in '93. So it looks good that there's another one down the pike still. (Quite honestly I've only given Vapor Trails the most cursory one-time listen and that was before embarking on this musical journey, so I very much look forward to revisiting it with fresher and more open ears). In the meantime, Counterparts is a landmark record...at least in terms of quality, if not historically.  <br /> <br />I'm really, really shocked this album isn't almost mutually adored on some Rush fan sites (many of which I see consider it slightly above average on the whole).  <br /> <br />It should be. <br /> <br />I give this album a perfect rating with a (-) for lack of familiarity. Erase that in a year's time. <br />
B000EMGAGW|4.0|I thought Blood Money was one of The Mobb's best efforts.  Of course it does not compare to The Infamous or to Murda Muzik but Blood Money is tight.   <br /> <br />The fact that Havoc still had a lot of production on the album (I think a bit over 70%) says to me that 50 was not trying to take over.  I am not really a 50 fan (The Massacre was a disaster to me) but I respect his creative ideas.  And even the other producers on the album still kept the sound somewhat Havoc-inspired. <br /> <br />A lot of people are confusing their reviews of Blood Money with their hatred for 50.  Hatred, or just tiredness of 50 aside, Blood Money is dope.  (Pearly Gates is ridiculous!!!) <br /> <br />Just give it a listen and try to be open minded.  They have been around for almost 15 years.  We owe them at least an unbiased listen.
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 Days is a well-crafted scotch aged to bring out many subtle flavors and nuances. Those who never experienced it will initially object to the potency of the substance. Even those who have had similar libations in the past may find it too powerful for the senses. But in time anyone who appreciates something different, a change of pace, and expert craftsmanship will come to embrace and love it.
0440213525|5.0|This book starts out innocently enough: young Mark Sway (age 11) and his younger brother Ricky (age 8) are out in a grassy area sharing a few cigarettes they stole from their mom, an over-worked, abused housewife; it would be Ricky's first cigarette, but not Mark's by far.  They get an unexpected surprise, however, when a crazed lawyer drives his car to the exact spot where Mark and Ricky were at (who are now hiding in the thick grass), pulls a hose from his car and begins pumping exhaust fumes into the car in an attempt to commit suicide...<br /><br />Mark enters the car to attempt to convince the deranged lawyer to stop trying to kill himself- and is taken hostage immediately.  The liquor loosens his tongue a little, though, and before passing out, the crook tells Mark that he knows where the body of a recently-assassinated US Senator is located.  Mark exits the car to try and calm his hysterical little bro down- and they both subsequently witness the man, a Jerome \\"Romey\\" Clifford, take a pistol and blow his brains out- taking his deadly secret to the grave with him- except Mark knows it now, too.<br /><br />And there are people who know that he knows it, too.  And when they start trying to force it out of him, he turns to the only one who believes him: a lawyer who just passed the bar four years prior- a lawyer who was paid a dollar as a retainer fee to help little Mark out.<br /><br />Grisham has once again crafted a thriller.  Frankly, I am a bit confused as to why people don't really like this one... It's just as good if not better than his other novels.<br /><br />Now just for fun, click the \\"yes\\" button to the proceeding  question
B000E97HIA|5.0|I got \\"3121\\" today and got blown away on my first listen. The impetus for getting it was \\"Incense and candles\\" but found what is oh-so-rare nowadays: buying an album to discover more than half of the songs are better than the song which made you buy it in the first place.  <br />It is arguably his best work. OK, maybe I am getting carried away but believe me, this is music at it's Princely best. <br />Buy it.
B00005OAA6|4.0|While currently Victoria is a mother of three sons & more of a celebrity, back in the latter half of 2001 she was a popstar. While she never found the commercial success this record deserved, it is a quite good pop record.<br /><br />Victoria's self-titled debut is pitched somewhere above Melanie B's lukewarm debut \\"Hot\\", but it doesn't reach the coveted \\"best of\\" spots like Emma's \\"Free Me\\", Melanie C's \\"Northern Star\\", or Geri's \\"Schizophonic\\". Here, we see that Victoria's influence is a bit more Toni Braxton than Madonna, as she channels American R&B elements through a British sophisti-pop filter. The overall sound is a shimmery cross between neo-new jack hip hop lite & melodic pop.<br /><br />\\"Not Such An Innocent Girl\\" opens the record on a high, it establishes the feel of the record. Stylish. Coifed. And ironically sensual. Other highlights include the Janet Jackson styled mid-tempo workout of \\"Midnight Fantasy\\", plush & actually genuine \\"A Mind of It's Own\\", & hip hop-lite bounce of \\"Like That\\". The latter is a rather defiant theme, some string work toward the end gives this cut even more depth.<br /><br />Victoria is in fine voice, clearly stronger from her touring with the Spice Girls & their last group record, 2000's \\"Forever\\".  She manages to be the detached seducer on \\"No Trix, No Games\\" & the removed \\" 'round the way girl\\" on \\"I Wish\\".<br /><br />The record begins to lose steam on the last few cuts, regaining it's footing on a rather touching tribute to her son Brooklyn on \\"Every Little Part of Me\\". Her rather large hit collabo with Dane Bowers & the Truesteppers, \\"Out of Your Mind\\" from the prior year isn't included. No clue as to why, but it would've quite well here.<br /><br />Basically, while there isn't anything that is breaking new ground, Victoria wears the sound of the album well. She probably won't record another full-length record, but this isn't a bad record to leave behind either.<br /><br />Worth a listen for any pop fan.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I'm 18 years old so I really cant say that I was into the Chili Peppers when they first came on to the music scene. The first Chili Peppers album I ever heard was Californiacation.  As soon as I heard it I was hooked on their soaring guitars, rock/funk beats, and roaring vocals. I soon realized that Californiacation wasnt even their best work after buying their other albums. The fact that they are the greatest band in the world today, and maybe the past twenty years is an understatment. Anybody who knows something about rock music will tell you that when it comes to pure soul, poured into music, nobody does it better than RHCP.  I bought By The Way in 2002 on the day of its release.  While it was still better than most any other music today, it didnt quite hold up to the work of albums such as Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Mothers Milk, and Freaky Styley.  I wondered if as they were getting older, their music was getting more subtle. My doubts were put to rest today with the purchase of Stadium Arcadium. This is probably RHCP's most extensive and soaring album to date. Twenty eight songs, all different, and all incredible in some way. True, there are still some softer, more subtle songs but they are much more thought provoking, and much better than the slower tracks heard on By The Way.  Songs such as the title track, Wet Sand, and Death of a Martian may be slower but they still have the same feel and soul of any other RHCP song. Snow (Hey Oh), soft or not, is one of the greatest songs that RHCP have ever recorded. For the most part, however, Stadium Arcadium rocks out with a sound and energy that hasnt been heard since Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  The first single, Dani California, is the perfect kick start to the album.  Anthony's rapper-like singing voice and John's funky rhythmic guitar prove to work perfectly. Flea's beyond brilliant bass playing once again provides the backbone of their sound. Other songs such as Tell Me Baby, Hump de Bump, Warlocks, and Storm In a Teacupsound like they could find a place on RHCP earlier albums with a level of intensity that hasnt been heard by the band in over 10 years. However, its the second to last track on the Mars CD, Turn It Again, that turns out to be the most powerful song of the entire elbum. I was blown away by the six minutes of pure energy shot off by this song. If RHCP releases this track as a single there is no doubt that it will tear up every chart in the country. Bottom line is that RHCP are back with this brilliant release that is sure to leave you breathless.
B00005JLWN|5.0|The cataclysm wrought by a third world war at the onset of the 21st century has forced the surviving world to abopt a new form of government to prevent the obliteration of the planet.  In the Kurt Wimmer written and directed intense sci-fi thriller \\"Equilibrium\\" the society known as Libria suppresses the act of feeling in its inhabitants.  With the aid of a drug Prozium, which all citizens inject at regular intervals, all emotions and feelings are quashed.  A vast militaristic organization has been created to root out any undesirables that don't follow these societal tenets.  At the apex of the enforcement arm are the Gramatan clerics, a group of super martial arts practitioners.<br /><br />Christian Bale stars as John Preston the most highly ranked Cleric with unsurpassed fighting skills.  Pure of thought and uncompromising, Bale and his partner Errol Partridge, played by Sean Bean comb the nether regions outside the city for rebels and to destroy any artifacts that could promote emotion and feelings.  His unflagging loyalty to societal head, Father played by Sean Pertwee is shaken when he is forced to kill Bean who has committed an unspeakable sensory crime.<br /><br />Bale purposely avoids dosing himself with Prozium which clears his mind and allows him to reconsider the jaded mores of the society.  Working with an ambitious and suspicious new partner Brandt played by Taye Diggs, he secretly joins forces with the underground while appearing to stalk them, striving to topple the gonernment.<br /><br />The underrated \\"Equilibrium\\" plays like a cross between \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"The Matrix\\" and compares quite favorably with the later.  Impressive action sequences filled with incredible gunplay propels the film forward, creating an exhilarating viewing experience.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is an album that people will be listening to for years to come.  I got it when it first came out, and have been listening to it on and off for about 2 years, for the first 6 months i absolutely rinsed it.  \\"through the wire\\" and \\"all falls down\\" influenced my decision to get this album initially, both very hot tracks in my opinion, but after u hear the whole thing you start skipping those tracks.  The best in my opinion are <br /> <br />Spaceship <br />Last Call <br />Family Business <br />Get em High <br /> <br />If you don't like those songs, or if you want really hardcore beats u wont like this.  There is a lot of soul influence and its really chilled, also the lyrics are smart throughout.. i prefer this to his next album, late registration! <br />
B0000019PA|5.0|This record transcends whatever words any mortal can write about it. Stop reading reviews and buy it. NOW.
B000005HLV|5.0|Some of you innocents might not know it, but there are some feelings most humans cannot even relate to and can never describe accurately as they are too obscure and unwelcoming to define. That is exactly why this album gets so much shallow feedback. If you like the woods and the night, fine, but this is music for people who TRULY HATE EVERY THING that interacts with life in a non-combative way. People hear the notoriety of this rigidly hateful music and somehow expect something definable, most people don't understand because they are too warm or too human to ever feel the way this album IS.  There is no excuse for listening to this while being in a good mood as this captures all the fun loving attitudes of a snuff film.  I must comment on the perfect job Attila has done on these vocals, stand out tracks include: \\"Cursed to Eternity\\", \\"Life Eternal\\",  and most definately \\"Buried by time & Dust\\" but once again a stranger to demonology or death rattle wouldn't know what a triumph this is. This might be the sickest music possible, it's more like a frequency for the misanthrope to vibrate along to. Obscure, Compelling, Not for humans. I like Bathory and Immortal too but come on, get over it. The fact that the album's writer's are both dead and the legacy left behind is one of remorseless bloodshed is no coincidence. Accidents don't just happen, something purposeful makes them happen and the human brain can only torture itself asking why. Allow this album to possess you and you'll feel why these dark things happen. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is an experience beyond critisism.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I think we can all agree from the reviews here, that Season 5 is not  a crowd pleaser.  Shooting was done around Sarah and Cynthia's real life pregnancies and this kind of spoilt it ... because Carrie looks pregnant throughout this season, and we all know her character is opposed to having a child.  As a result, she wears the most ridiculous costumes in this Season to try to hide it, which does not match her usual fashionable style.  You have to wonder why filming wasn't just put on hold.  Despite this, the season has its rewarding episodes out of the eight on offer.  IN particular, when Charolotte meets Harry, and Sam's vibrator.    The biggest problem with this season is that it is quite depressing, and none of the characters seem to want to be there.  Fortunately, the fun atmosphere picks up again in time for Season 6.  AS another reviwer pointed out, you can almost skip Season 5 and go straight to Season 6.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|If you've heard Gilmour's work in the context of Pink Floyd's albums -- and I mean *all* their albums -- than you've already heard just about every lick David throws out on this new solo album. <br /> <br />If you're one of those who have only heard Pink Floyd on the radio or via their 1973-79 run of hit albums (Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall), you'll probably enjoy this album a great deal, as you'll be treated with sounds you've never heard before. But if PF's more obscure albums are familiar to you, you may feel (like I did) that this album is full of noises that are all too familiar. It almost sounds like he sampled some of his best \\"unknown\\" guitar licks into a series of new songs. <br /> <br />I wanted to like this album -- I really did -- as there were some shining moments on Gilmour's two earlier solo albums. But I have to admit that I was rather disappointed that, after all this time away from recording, that he didn't have a batch of fresh tunes ready. Maybe next time.
0307276902|5.0|Title: Million Little Pieces Author: James Frey ISBN: 0307276902 <br /> <br />This is the best book I have ever read!! <br /> <br />\\"I woke up not knowing were I was or who I am.  I touch my right cheek and I am bleeding.\\" <br /> This book is about a drug addict his name is James Frey.  It mostly takes place at an addiction hall were alcoholics and drug users go.  It doesn't really say when it takes place but if I were to guess I would guess that it takes place around 2000.  It doesn't really say why he is like this but I would guess it is because he doesn't have any kids or a wife. And the genre is autobiography.  <br /> This book was definitely one of my favorite books.  Because I like how James told us all of the information.  And I am in to all the drug addictions and alcoholics.  I like to learn about all of some people's trouble mainly drugs, because it shows me how bad they are and it makes me not want to do them.  So as I am reading an excellent book I am also learning want to do and want not to do.  I would definitely recommend this book.  Because it was one of those books that I couldn't put down.  And it was a fast book.  Usually I get board of books on the 3rd chapter but not this one I never got board.  The people that might want to read this book is a young teen.  Because it talks about the problems with drugs and alcohol, and teens these days want to try all of that stuff but this book I think will change there minds. <br />  Do you connect with the character?  No I don't connect with the character, because he is into drugs and alcohol and I am against all of that. Do you enjoy this genre?  I do enjoy it, because it is true and it is the person who wrote it was the person actually living it.  Who would enjoy reading it?  Like I said before young teens, because they want to try drugs and alcohol and this book will I think change their minds.   <br />
B000ENV2P0|5.0|It's May 9th!! Today is the day!!<br /><br />So I put it in and turn it on.  It's more melodic than any of the other albums by RHCP by far.  It immediately takes me to another world far from work, bills, and other things I could possibly be thinking of.  The harmonies bring me to a place where I'm riding along highway 101 with the top down and my feet on the dashboard, the wind racing through my hair, taking each curve with grace.<br /><br />If you don't have it now, I would recommend going out and paying for it.  Don't download the bad quality from the internet.  It's worth it.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|When The Doors released Waiting for the Sun, many wondered where the punch and energy from the quartet went. However, many began to realize the importance and duality of such a band, too.<br /><br />First Impressions of Earth works that way for The Strokes, and it might disappoint some fans.<br /><br />If the song \\"Juicebox\\" is a supposed indication of what The Strokes have to offer right now, then the band is doing a poor job. While singer/songwriter Julian Casablancas wails like an immortal Jim Morrison throughout the chorus, the backbone of the song is pretty standard - rocking Strokes-ish material. In that case, the rest of the album slows down with the Mellotron laden \\"Ask Me Anything,\\" a long ballad for Casablancas, or the ethereal landscapes that bud in \\"15 Minutes,\\" revealing a thicker, more balanced Strokes.
B00005221M|5.0|Sticking to history and adding a personal touch are not an easy mixture in cinema. However, this film is successful in placing the viewer among the English, the French and the Native Americans torn between the two. It also develops characters that are easily followed and endeared or despised. I have watched the film many times and never advance to any favored scenes. The entire movie holds my interest and keeps me caring for, hoping for and suffering with the characters. A serious, interesting and personal expression of American history, The Last of the Mohicans is a cinematic gem.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|I guess I should stop the review there, considering I've summed up my appreciation for this band.<br /><br />No, that wouldn't do it justice.<br /><br />Wolfmother is one of the better bands making music and still retaining youth. They have energy, they roar, and they probably bite--depending on what you taste like.<br /><br />A song like \\"Woman\\" or \\"Dimension\\" are full of MC5 riffs, that play off a psychedelic, adrenaline-like wall that would make Black Sabbath proud.<br /><br />However, there is filler and a lot of it. By the time the album's clocking in at the end, you're missing the energy of the band and frankly churning through the lull. The songs are still orchestrated beautifully, but they seem to lose steam.<br /><br />The vocalist treads over ground that seems fairly obvious. (e.g. The White Stripes, Led Zeppelin) Yet there are times when he is stepping into his own. His appearance itself is deadly, so as a frontman he has it, where most are lacking.<br /><br />For eight dollars, you can't go wrong. This album is all the rage and energy that The White Stripes seemed to leave behind years ago after recording Elephant. They're not slowed down and they're not making songs for melodies, but melodies for songs...if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Keep watching this band, they will no doubt make a mark somewhere.
B00014K5TQ|3.0|A true story, this film presents facts within a most bizarre, theatrical whirlwind. I had never heard this story before watching the film, but I was taken into the fantasy world that one youth made into reality. From the perspective of a deeply involved participant, viewers are taken on the chaotic club ride led by a youth who was on a downward spiral. He remained delusional to the very conclusion, perhaps as confused as any viewer of this film. Amazingly, he collected an enormous following, occupying hundreds of hungry night life addicts. If you found something missing in the news reports, you'll get it after watching this film.
B000BPK2OI|5.0|Totally love this album. I must confess it was very VERY pleasent surprise when I receive this item and had the DVD with the concert. There is only one thing: I live in Europe and don't think I will be able to see the DVD.... but I also haven't tried. If I'll be able, I hope to have such good result from it as from the CD.  <br /> <br />But I must say: the CD is NOT live (as I thought it would be when I purchase it). Nevertheless..... is FABULASTIC!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Each Tool album, from the Opiate to 10,000 Days is an obvious mark in the band's (and its members) evolution.  If you don't get 10,000 Days just yet and you are a true Tool fan, I can offer you this advice: sit back and be patient, for you are just not there yet.  I am certain there are many diehard fans who have evolved from an angry, moshing, tattoo loving, drug abusing, blaming, angry  teenagers to contemplative, self reflecting, buddhist-like adults who now, on occassion,  smile.  Tool's evolution is quite reflective of the band member's own personal journey in this realm, and if you feel slighted by this album, just relax and it will come to you.  When Laterlaus first came out I loved it musically but didn't feel the connection within until a few months later. Now it it is the single album which defines me as a person.  I am certain 10,000 days will do the same, that is, when I am ready to let it.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This is amongst their BEST albums after TEN.I would rate it even better than Vs and Vitalogy.The songs,guitar solos and instrumentation are terrific.Please ignore the haters and get this TODAY.FIVE STARS.
0066620996|5.0|This book does a great job outlining the enduring qualities that ensure excellence. The facts of this book are extremely well documented and backed up by hard facts, not subjective rants.
0792846443|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of American cinema. Misery is about a famous author, Paul Sheldon (played by James Caan), who has just finished writing a book that does not yet have a title (\\"Untitled\\" was the name of it). He goes out leaving the lodge he was staying in and shortly after he leaves, there is a huge snowstorm coming down, so bad to a point that Paul loses control of his car (a '65 Mustang, believe it or not), and crashes down a hill and lies for sometime in the overturned car, mangled and almost dead. Luckily for him, along comes Annie Wilkes (played by Kathy Bates), who saves him and nurses him back to health in the comforts of her own country home. A couple of days later, Paul wakes up and sees himself in Annie's home, and he realizes that she is his \\"Number 1 Fan\\", and proves it by having all of Paul's published Misery archives of the Misery character. At first, Annie seems like a nice person, but shortly later on, she becomes a total [...] and reveals her true colors when she reads about Misery being killed. She has an extreme fit (probably much worse than a general PMS fit) about Misery's demise and insists that Paul write a new novel to \\"bring Misery back\\", which she called \\"Misery's Return\\"! (After making him burn his untitled book in a barbecue grill!!) How ridiculous and senseless that seems; it's quite obvious that when a character ends up dead in a story, he or she cannot possibly come back to life. Another incredible and intriguing scene is while Annie is at the store getting new typing paper for Paul because the kind she got was the kind that smudged, he gets out of his room and discovers Annie's scrapbook. This is where he learns of her troubled past by seeing the newspaper articles about these various people who were killed in her care at the hospital where she worked, including numerous infant babies (the scene where he hurries back to his room after hearing Annie's Jeep pull up returning to the house is a nail biter as well; you almost think he won't make it back in time but he does--narrowly). Annie also becomes obsessed with Paul and his writing of the \\"new novel\\" that not only is she nursing him back to health (in a macabre and slow way), but she is also holding him against his will in her home. In other words, Annie was making it quite difficult and almost impossible for Paul to survive and recover. Some of the people closest to him, his agent (played by screen legend Lauren Bacall), and Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen (the husband-and-wife police team), have almost no hope of ever finding Paul alive. But, towards the end of the movie, the sheriff goes to Annie's house inquiring about Paul, and Annie is giving just idle and small talk about her \\"general liking\\" for Paul's work. When the sheriff leaves, Paul makes a noise to distract the sheriff, sheriff walks back in, sees Paul downstairs in the cellar and gets shot by Annie's double barrel shotgun! The hobbling scene earlier in the film is scary to watch, and you almost feel the intense pain that Paul feels when Annie uses her strength to smash his ankles on that log; she did that to make sure he stays in his room and continues writing. Before she hobbles his feet, she also took away what I call his \\"freedom key\\", which was one of her bobby pins from her hair. What a hateful lady Annie is!!! The real showdown comes at the end of the movie when Paul and Annie are fighting. She's eager to find out what happens at the end of the book, but Paul tries to knock her out and the fight is on. The whole fight seems to be over when Paul trips Annie and she lands onto the typewriter (its bell rings when she bangs her head on it; ouch!!). But, a few seconds later, when Paul has crawled out of his room, Annie comes back for more and she is obviously finished off when Paul hits her with what I call an \\"iron version of Misery the pig\\", and it's over. I am a huge fan of this movie and of Kathy Bates. She is a great andexcellent actress and she truly deserved her Oscar for her role as Annie Wilkes. Annie Wilkes is also one of the most scary fictitious characters in the history of American cinema. Get this movie; with a mixed bag of comedy and horror, you will be almost scared to death and kind of amused!!!
B000002VCU|5.0|This is one of Parsons' best albums to date.  Every song on it has some allure, and the title tracks are two of his best. <br /> <br />The album opens with May Be A Price to Pay, which generally isn't my favorite Parsons song, but it fits in very well with the context of the album (gambling). <br /> <br />Games People Play is the standout track of the first five songs.  It was one of their first hits, and it is quite good indeed.  Well worth multiple listens.  The opening is similar to that of Damned If I Do. <br /> <br />Time was also a hit, and was one of the few Parsons songs I heard before I got into the project.  Some people would say you have no soul if this song doesn't make you melt.  It certainly has that capability, but it is too repetetive to be a standout song. <br /> <br />I Don't Wanna Go Home is my personal least favorite song on the album.  It is a Lenny Zakatek sung rocker, and it doesn't cut it for me. <br /> <br />The Gold Bug is a decent instrumental, but not nearly as good as the other on this disc.  The opening, with the whistling, is quite enjoyable. <br /> <br />After this, the disc changes to more of a focus on gambling.  The next five songs are almost one song, split into five parts. <br /> <br />This section opens with part 1 of the title track.  This is an absolutely fabulous song by Parsons, and is probably in his top 5 (including part 2 as well).  This song is the opener of this section, and it is essentially a person traveling to Vegas and seeing all of the gamblers. <br /> <br />Next comes Snake Eyes, a look into a gambler's obsession with the game.  The gambler is praying that the dice will give him just what he needs, and he asks for one more minute of gambling. <br /> <br />The Ace of Swords is next, and is one of my favorite Parsons instrumentals.  The slower opening is very good, and then the change to a more upbeat section is even better.  Fans of Mammagamma might like this instrumental. <br /> <br />Nothing Left to Lose signifies how the person who came to Vegas has lost everything gambling.  It begins to close the album, with some words, then an instrumental ending that includes a section from Snake Eyes. <br /> <br />The Turn of a Friendly Card (2) ends the album.  It has one stanza of lyrics and then the chorus from part 1, except that the stanza, which resembles the first stanza of part 1 (which showed the outsider looking in on Vegas), now shows that the visitor is himself a gambler, and is in fetters and chains (unable to break the addiction). <br /> <br />All in all, this is yet another fine album by the Alan Parsons Project.  Credit should be given to Eric Woolfson, who did much of the songwriting, and sang on Time (and I think something else as well).  This is an excellent album to get after listening to I Robot and Eye in the Sky in the Alan Parsons Project repetoire.
B000683VI4|4.0|Too often romance stories are heavy handed and fall into soap opera territory at its worst.  But the Notebook manages to convey the relationships in a realistic, entertaining way without relying on emotional manipulation.  The leads are all great and the chemistry works.  If you are in the mood for a romance, this is one of the better ones that I've seen.
B000002VCO|4.0|Ammonia Avenue is many Parsons fans' favorite album.  It's also many's least favorite.  It is furthering his change towards pop music, from the prog rock that he began as. <br /> <br />The album opens with Prime Time, one of the better tracks.  It is about fame, and being the star, much the same as Limelight (on the later album Stereotomy), but not quite as good.  Still, it is quite enjoyable. <br /> <br />Let Me Go Home reminds me of I Don't Wanna Go Home from Turn of a Friendly Card.  Both aren't very good.  Lyrically, this song doesn't fit on the album, and the lyrics themselves don't seem to go together.  Easily the worst song on the album. <br /> <br />One Good Reason is a step up.  It is a bit repetitive, but it is catchy, and worth listening to in the context of the album.  While it is not great out of context, all Parsons albums were meant to be listened to from start to finish.  Though this album's theme is not apparent, it still flows and should be treated as a concept album. <br /> <br />Since the Last Goodbye is a ballad that I personally enjoy.  It is not overdone, but not underdone either.  It's, as Goldilocks would say, just right. <br /> <br />Don't Answer Me is a lot like One Good Reason, in that it is very catchy.  As a song, it's pretty good, but it could be more refined, especially lyrically. <br /> <br />Dancing on a High Wire is one of my favorites on the album.  It could be better done, but Colin Blunstone's (I think they're his) vocals shine on this song. <br /> <br />You Don't Believe is another catchy song, and is probably right in the middle, behind Don't Answer Me and ahead of One Good Reason. <br /> <br />Pipeline is the only instrumental on this disc, which is disappointing, but it is quite well done.  It is not Parsons' best, but it is well better than his worst. <br /> <br />Then, last but not least, comes the title track.  This song is the gem of the album.  It is one of my favorite Parsons' songs, and probably makes any of my Top 50song lists.  The only downside is the overdone instrumental interlude in the middle, but even that sounds good (as opposed to the one in Silence and I, on Eye in the Sky). <br /> <br />This album is a good starting place for Parsons if you're a pop fan.  If you like songs more in the vein of Pink Floyd, start with I, Robot.  Then progress until you get to this album. <br /> <br />Like any Parsons album, it takes several listens, but fewer than most of his albums.
B00028HBL6|2.0|It's not a very subtle film is it?  It's not a complete disaster and technically it's flawless as could be expected but why would one want to watch torture for the duration of a feature length film?  Is the film aimed at the type of person who has, through the centuries showed up cheering at public executions and beatings?  Propably, and there is a lot of them isn't there?
0446677450|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in increasing their financial literacy.  Rich Dad Poor Dad teaches you to act like, be like and think like a Rich person instead of a poor person. The book is an easy & fun read. <br /> <br />Although I find Robert writing the book as an oversimplification of the wealth process, which is unlikely to take place for the average family person, that has a family and many other expenses to support, while living in the big cities <br /> <br />Robert's concept may very much work for the average single person just starting a life, in a region that the cost of living is cheap & is able to take the risk of struggling to make it big and be a failure for the rest. <br />
B00003003R|4.0|Well. It's hard to believe that it's already been more than 7 years since I bought this CD in 1999. Since then, it was always one of my favorite live performance CD so far. Probably it's because there are undeniable reasons in spite of a couple of weak points. <br /> <br />As the title of this CD [Live Era 87-93], it was only 7 years in the history that GN'R showed us their performance. Those days was one of the most exciting years ; thrilling, powerful, and exciting rock band ruled the world, not only US but also Europe, Asia, South America.. all over the world. I don't remember when it was the last time that we has a band like them; maybe only few exception is just U2 & Metallica. But one thing is sure - since the 90's there wasn't much time that we had such a real fun as we watched GN'R. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Green Day, Oasis, Blur, Radiohead, RATM... OK, they are all pretty good bands. But I always looked for GN'R's CD when I'm tired of their music. Why? Because I felt I need something more rocking and it was GN'R. And this CD has what I need; it was Rock And Roll.  <br /> <br />First off, this CD has pretty decent sellection even though I wish there were a couple of songs I like personally. I can't complain too much. But one song, 'Coma' only in Japanese edition is a real hidden gem. Don't miss it. <br /> <br />Sencondly, one weak point is too varied. Maybe this is a inevitable choice between a live CD which is selected from 1 or 2 good concert, or compilation of various performances. AXL chose the second one just like the title from their early days in 1987 to the last good days with original members SLASH & DUFF in 1993. And it made this CD set weak in the matter of concentration. Honestly, I prefer the first choice as a Fan, their legendary lives like Ritz in 1988, Monsters Of Rock 1988, or Rio in 1991. So I wish AXL release one more complete concert as DVD or CD sets. (I know there's not much chance for that, except bootlegs.) And I think it'd be better if there's some simple comments for each tracks like \\"Date/Place/Members\\". <br /> <br />In conclusion, this CD set is not perfectly satisfactory to me due to the standard of making, but I had no doubt about the quality itself.
B000059PQQ|1.0|I read the book and this wasn't as funny.  Richard Burton took this role because he was drunk most of time.  I don't about the rest of the cast, but I assume they were too.  Ewa must have flown back to Sweden to do swedish porn or where ever she came from because I never saw her in anymore movies here.  The book was hysterical, and with all the talent involved it really should have been a much better movie. Too bad.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Not BULLFROGS- as the movie has it - but real, live eensy-weensy, bijou tree frogs. Still, the experience, once experienced, will loom larger than the grudging, prosaic truth - larger than the fllimsy miniatures one might actually see or step on in an amphibious deluge - and so I forgive the Bunyanesque hyperbole and the gross exaggeration, in the interests of affirming, once and for all, the authenticity of such enchanted froggy precipitation -  a phenomenon I have witnessed on two stone-sober, perfectly sane occasions.<br /><br /> This is also the best movie of its type since Short Cuts.
0767817486|4.0|Midnight Express is a brilliant film that reflects an historical moment that those of us of a certain age certainly remember.  The first time I watched it, I sympathized primarily with Billy.  Regardless of his conviction, no one deserves the sadistic treatment he received throughout his incarceration.  And so what if the film makers changed some of the story?  It's a movie - fiction - not a documentary. <br /> <br />All the same - during a recent viewing, I covered my eyes in disbelief at Billy's unbelievably stupid and oblivious smuggling scheme. That's it kid - smuggle hash out of a country in political turmoil whose laws are arbitrarily and brutally enforced by the nation's military police.   <br /> <br />How dumb can you be? <br /> <br />In the mid-seventies, not long after Billy's prison escape, I travelled round Turkey where everyone, Turks and Westerners alike, partook of certain substances.  In Istanbul we frequented the infamous Pudding Shop, location of a cop scene in Midnight Express, never once imagining that anyone could, or would, be busted there.  During a five day stay with Turkish farmers, heavily armed soldiers at random MP roadblocks stopped our car four times.   <br /> <br />So who's the dumb one? <br /> <br />Midnight Express is a valuable primer on what not to do when travelling that shows the dreadful consequences of breaking laws in a state that lacks the legal safeguards we have (or used to have till W took office), and that I think some Americans too easily take for granted.   I am not passing judgement on Turkey, or on any country - but the reality is that some prison systems are worse than others.  Not much has changed since 1978 in that regard.
B00004SCX6|1.0|So, what is it that people see in Mrs. Spears? It's not her music, I've worked that much out. It probably isn't her nonexistant, overblown \\"sexuality\\", either. At this point, she's became a parody of herself. It's probably because she's tabloid fodder...yeah, that's it...it's useless people like Brittney that should be sent off to fight for Iraq.
B000EULJLU|5.0|If you have any interest in Tool, go ahead n pick this one up.  There's a lot of nay-sayers to go with this album.  Why?  Well Tool tends to draw a large crowd of atheistic and agnostic type minds because of Maynard's infamous anti-religious lyrics.  These guys, in my opinion, don't appreciate the entirety of Tool.  They worship Maynard, prolly would even give him a reach around if they could.  He is a great lyricist, but in this album theres very little references to an opinion of religion, FINALLY, it's time to move on!  What frosts peoples balls is the fact that many people know that, and have a hard time connecting with what Maynard is trying to say in many a song.  Well, lyrics are merely a tribute to music, but a lot of Tool fans beleive in the inverse relationship.  This is a beautifully composed album.  The tone and detail of which could only be compared to that of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.  And all of us that really appreciate the MUSIC don't even need to comment the octopus-like drumming of Danny Carey.  A+ in my opinion, a quartet that has truly grown into an overwhelming enigma when creating art.  Get some BAD ASS speakers, quiet everything else in the world. Close your eyes, and listen.  I'll see you when you come back to earth!!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Thank you Warner Home Video, for releasing the second season of my favorite television series in August instead of waiting until October as you did for Season 1.<br /><br />For those looking for the true heir to Buffy the Vampire Slayer in terms of a sharp script and snappy dialogue look no further than the UPN show Veronica Mars. Not since Sunnydale dropped into a deep chasm has television seen such a fabulous ensemble of talented young actors deliver such inventive dialogue in intelligent, darkly humorously directed fare.<br /><br />For me Tuesday nights became the most anticipated TV night of the week and I could not get enough of the show or its hot star Kristen Bell. It quickly shot up the rankings on my TiVo season pass where it now sits at number one and my Kristen Bell TiVo wish-list was set to auto-record so I would not miss any program in which she was featured. I remember the anger when my local UPN station decided to air a baseball game instead of one episode - never have I felt more like putting pen to paper to express my displeasure with a programming decision.<br /><br />So what is this show that induces such passion? It's a detective show, no it's a romantic drama, or is it a dark comedy? Well, in reality it is all of this and more. Set in the California city of Neptune, it paints the picture of a society split between the have's such as the rich Kane family or movie star Aaron Echoll's children and the have-nots (notably title character Veronica Mars and her friends Wallace and Weevil).<br /><br />Veronica is the daughter of Keith Mars, the former Sheriff, who is now a private detective. The first season centered around the investigation into the murder of Veronica's best friend Lilly and  Veronica's rape and the second  season centers on the investigation into a bus crash that sent a group of students over a cliff to their deaths - a bus that Veronica was supposed to be riding. In addition a second mystery that is not resolved until later in the season is who was responsible for the death of Weevil's cousin Felix.<br /><br />But, as Veronica continues her investigation each episode involves the investigation into a lesser mystery. From who was responsible for the death of a classmates dog to the blackmail of gay students<br /><br />Veronica (with the help of Wallace, Mac and assorted other friends) must navigate a world of pirate radio stations, Irish gangs and still vie for the Kane scholarship, which would allow her to make her dreams of attending Stanford a reality.<br /><br />In addition to the great script the other strength of the show is in assembling a wonderful ensemble of young actors. Led by Kristen Bell who as Veronica outdo's Buffy in the dry humor department, and ably supported by Canadian actor Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, the two really display a true father-daughter affection for each other which apparently was true off-screen as well. In addition to this dynamic there is also Percy Daggs III as Veronica's best friend (and cohort in her investigations) Wallace and Jason Dohring appears as Logan, the bad-boy rich kid son of Aaron (played by Harry Hamlin of \\"Clash of the Titans\\" fame).<br /><br />Completing the talented young cast is Francis Capra as biker bad-boy Weevil and new to this season is the very appealing and spunky Tessa Thompson as Wallace's girlfriend Jackie. She was disliked initially by fans though as the season went on she became more popular - personally I had liked her from her first scene.<br /><br />This show needs to be seen to be believed. Sure I am a diehard fan of the show, but I defy any viewer not to became charmed by the drama, romance, humor and well drawn characters. Yes, the mysteries are solved but a lot of the fun comes in the journey towards those last episodes of the season. The season finale aired just last night and I was blown away by it. I was shocked and drawn in to every emotionally powered minute of it and fans across the internet are raving about it.Season 3 simply cannot come soon enough for me.<br /><br />On this DVD set of six discs we are promised a behind the scenes featurette, gag reel and deleted scenes which would be a vast improvement on the relatively bare-bones season 1 release. Warner Bros. was apparently surprised by the fan following that VERONICA MARS had developed during season 1 so they did not prepare adequately for that season's DVD release. Thankfully they were better prepared this time around.me. <br />On this DVD set of six discs we are promised a behind the scenes featurette, gag reel and deleted scenes which would be a vast improvement on the relatively bare-bones season 1 release.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|First review in over 5 years of shopping at Amazon.. figured I had to put in my \\"vote\\" for this series. I can't recall being as excited about a network show.. ever.

I loved the movie, but the series was magic. *Taps fingers on desk waiting for the next chapter...*
B000063DGC|5.0|Randy Rhoads, was one of the greatest guitar players on the planet..  However, when he died March 19th, 1982, he was only 25 years of age. We never really got to see what this kid could do... but from this album... We already know today. Who knows what would've happened if he were still alive. Thank you for the awesome playing Randy.. You are just... fantastic, I can't describe. As Ozzy's wife says: \\"When he walked into the room, you just saw him, and he was beautiful\\". Ozzy hired him, even before he got to show his stuff, while he was warming up! <br /> <br />On the guitar solo track on this cd, there are so many notes played. His solos are better than Neal Schon's, and Brian May's, and hell, even Eddie Van Halen! I believe Randy could've smashed these guitar players of the 80's, 70's, and 60's. I believe Randy could even take on Yngwie Malmsteen, with his incredible speed, but that's 2 different genre's of music. <br /> <br />Here's the bottom line. There is nothing negative about this cd. Randy Rhoads and Poison's C.C. Deville are incredibly fast at playing live! 2 of the fastest players live I have ever heard! I can't compare Randy to C.C. however. <br /> <br />This cd is a real tribute to the great one, who influenced me, along with Neal Schon. Get it, if you love Randy Rhoads.... He is the real man.
6305358567|3.0|Lush, well produced, beautfully filmed, visually appealing, well-acted, all of these describe \\"Elizabeth.\\"  \\"Historical\\" however, does not.  I am very surprised at the number of people here who claim to be lovers of British history who praised the film for its accurate depiction of events.  Elizabeth could certainly play the fragile, indecisive maid when she needed to do so, but fragile and uncertain she was not-- she learned hard politics from a real master, her father, Henry VIII.<br />Certainly fond of Lord Dudley, there is no evidence they ever had a sexual relationship.  The sorry truth is, if Good Queen Bess ever had a sexual relationship it was with her abusive guardian, the husband of Queen Catherine (Parr).  Elizabeth and Anjou never met, in England or elsewhere (she did later meet his brother, who came closer than other man to marrying her but of course did not succeed).<br />The clothing and hair styles, while deserving of notice, are largely inaccurate, in some cases, Edwardian more than Elizabethan. This is somewhat surprising given the rich and accurate store of knowledge regarding the couterie of the period.<br />There are numerous other points to make, but simply know this:<br />This is a work of fiction, based on certain historical figures and a few historical events.  Watch the film and appreciate the fine acting, the beautiful settings and costumes, and the intensity and passion of the characters (who really were that proud, that devoted, and that ready to die for their various causes), but do not learn history from it.  Hopefully you'll be intrigued enough to find a few good books to read and learn of it yourself-- you may be surprised that the real stories are even more arresting.<br />History takes place over periods of years, decades, and longer, and even significant events that unfold quickly can be awfully hard to condense into a 2 hour movie, so faulting them for inaccuracies serves little purpose; audiences should however be better trained to recognize fiction and enjoy it but not necessarily learn historical facts from it.  Rather, learn about the human condition from fiction, which is the greatest purpose it serves.n and enjoy it but not necessarily learn historical facts from it.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|I have owned this CD for 3 days and as I type I am listening to it for the 7th time.  Every time I hear it I like it more.  It is music to listen to and savor.  Their sound alone is wonderful but listening to the lyrics and learning them enhances the experience.  The music is hypnotic and I find myself singing bits of \\"If this is Good-bye\\" or \\"Beyond my wildest dreams\\" as I go about my day.  It would be impossible to say which song I like best as there are 4 or 5 candidates for that title.  This is definitely a keeper!
B000EOTAM6|2.0|This film should have been made ten years ago at the height of Aeon Flux's popularity on MTV.  With that said and done, I must say Aeon Flux falls flat on its hopeful face.  The special effects are awesome, Charlize Theron is brilliant as Aeon Flux (although I hated her shoes) and Marton Csokas is the perfect Trevor Goodchild (although his appearance would have benefited greatly if he had bleached his hair blonde like the animated Trevor). Also Frances McDormand is good for a chuckle as the leader of the Monicans.  <br /> <br />However, the problem with this big screen version of Aeon Flux is there's too much focus on plot.  Part of the charm of the animated version is the ambiguity of the storyline, being thrust into the middle of the action not quite knowing the whats or the whys of what is happening. Aeon wasn't exactly a likeable, moral or \\"good guy\\" character and all of the blatant sexuality and sado-masochistic undertones found in the animated series are completely stripped away leaving behind a very homogenous film trying very hard to create a cohesive storyline out of a very incohesive and abstract half hour show.  And, if I recall correctly, didn't Aeon die at the end of every one of the early episodes? <br />Overall, an entertaining yet disappointing adaptation.
B0001A79JO|5.0|This band is one of the most talented to make an appearance in this century.  Miss Patricia Day Makes the band, in my opinion.  Shes a talented beautiful singer who can play her bass worth a damn and actually has quite a diverse style of playing as well.  Her slaps are well timed and placed in the songs, and the vocals nhance this. <br />Not only is she talented, but the rest of the band is as well.  How Often is it that a band comes out of nowhere not only playing older style music, but singing about horror movies?  And, not to mention again, doing it well.  The songs are diverse and skillfully mastered, and the Horrorpops show no signs of let-downs any time soon. <br />Great talent and skill can be found in this band.  Pick this one up!
B000EULJLU|3.0|I am a big Tool fan and their latest release is a little weak. I have listened to it numerous times (it's a Tool thing) and it's just not growing on me. They are some quality tunes: Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot, and Rosetta Stoned. However, the rest of the album is just not there. A lot of their riffs and rhythms sound like rehashed material: Vicarious sounds similar to Schism (Lateralus) and an almost identical riff from Jimmy (Aenima) can be heard halfway through Right in Two. I am usually amazed by the complex turns their songs take while they pull you in further and further. This time out I feel more like I'm on the outside wanting in. I expect a lot out this band because they have delivered on every other album. I keep trying to get into it, but it just ain't happening.
B000EULJLU|5.0|From the first song you know you are back in Tool territory.  \\"Vicarious\\" is everything the perfect Tool song should be.  Honestly, that song alone is worth the album price.  However, the album is like a long dark tour through hell on earth and never has it sounded more beautiful and satisfying.  Tool is back with a vengeance.  10,000 days for me means the number of days in a row I will listen to this album before I start the cycle all over again. If you like Tool, you'll like this record.  Just buckle up and enjoy the ride.  You'll be rocked and hypnotized.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|...this is a fantastic album, Gilmour-style! And fans of early Pink Floyd-albums such as \\"Meddle\\" have got absolutely no reason anymore to doubt David Gilmours' influence on the legendary band. I read some reviewers call it something like \\"Division Bell 2\\", personally I can't really say it reminds me that much of \\"The Division Bell\\" -as mentioned it sounds far more early Floydish to my ears, or in two words described; Haunting and melancholic.     It might be experienced as quite a demanding musical piece actually the first couple of times you listen yourself through it, the title track gave me nothing the first time I heard it -and honestly I had my doubts until it slowly grew on me, and today along with \\"Blue\\", \\"Smile\\", \\"A Pocketful Of Stones\\" (and so on...) it sounds just perfect. Perfect for a late and darkblue summers' night surrounded by friends (...like in the lyrics...), sipping beer in some total relaxing harmony. Every time I put on this cd I'm there. It has the sound of ocean, and solitude.    I think a couple of the songs somehow disturbs the experience just a bit, like they don't quite manage to fit no matter how many times I hear them. I'm not very fond of \\"Take a Breath\\", but mainly because it is a bit noisy and doesn't match the rest of the \\"feel\\" of the album. In my opinion.    Other than that; Finally, Dave! Good to have you back!
B0002EXH54|4.0|\\"Peace Sells...\\" was undisputably the album that put Megadeth on the map, and out of all Megadeth's albums it remains the one I enjoy best. It may lack the polish and technicality of their later albums such as \\"Rust in Peace,\\" or their peers in Metallica, but this album captures an air of energy and righteous anger that they never again matched. <br /> <br />The music here mostly constitutes fast, aggressive riffage from the rhythm guitar, with the lead playing impressively tricky technical licks over the top. The drumming is solid, but nothing to write home about. \\"Peace Sells...\\" demonstrates a definite hardcore punk influence in the contemptuous and sardonic attitude of the music. In keeping with that influence, the production is quite rough and here and there you'll hear a riff that just doesn't feel comfortable. This suggests that Megadeth's songwriting had yet to be perfected. But in the long run, it all just helps to contribute to the album's down-and-dirty attitude. And at the end of the day, it's easy to lose yourself in the speedy energy of the seemingly unbridled and untamed thrashery (I know thrashery isn't a word, go away!) of this composition. <br /> <br />Dave Mustaine... now here's an interesting situation. In keeping with the punk element of \\"Peace Sells...,\\" Mustaine can't sing to save himself. But the funny thing is that you, the listener, will find yourself not caring. Similarly to Quorthon of Sweden's Bathory, his voice actually compliments the music quite well because of the sheer amount of passion he puts into it. You can just see the contemptuous sneer on his face when you hear him drawl the opening \\"So whaddaya mean I don't believe in God?\\" of the title track. It would be a lie to claim that Mustaine ever came across as anything but an enigmatic frontman. <br /> <br />In conclusion, while the imperfect songwriting prevents \\"Peace Sells...\\" from being a genuine classic, this is still a considerable work of raw thrash metal. For anyone lookingto get into the genre, I reccomend picking this up soon after Metallica's \\"Master Of Puppets.\\"
B000EULJLU|2.0|Let me preface by saying that Tool is my favorite band of all time.  That's what made this so difficult.  There's not even a lot to say about this album, because there isn't a lot of album here.  There is a lot of sound-scapish environment creating effects, and not enough actual song.  Aenima and Lateralus were great because even when there wasn't a lot going on, you could tell it was going SOMEWHERE, and that the payoff would be well worth the wait.  Not the case here.  It's really become a chore to even listen to this.   <br /> <br />10,000 Days sounds like a compilation of B-Sides from Undertow through Lateralus.  Things they wrote and then thought, \\"No, that's not good enough to go on our album\\".  It all sounds rehashed.  Tell me The Pot doesn't sound like something from Undertow.  Maynard's lyrics seem a little tired as well.  Take for example, \\"Who are you to wave your finger?  You must have been out your head\\".  We've already been given that message on Aenima.  He's already said that.  Time to move on.  <br /> <br />\\"You must have been high\\" is possibly the worst offender.  Just a terrible lyric.   <br /> <br />And yes, it is worth nitpicking little things because as a Tool fan I have come to expect much much more from them.  Lateralus is, to me, a perfect album.  Aenima is also excellent.  This is because they are first and foremost albums, but they always managed to work the art in.  This seems like they just couldn't find a balance between the two here.  As I said earlier, just imagine 10,000 days as a compilation of B-Sides.  They don't fit together well as an album, you've heard it all before, and they aren't that good to begin with. <br /> <br />What stopped me from giving this 1 star?  Well, the production values are excellent, and everything sounds incredibly good.  But it doesn't matter if you use the most expensive paints and best brushes to paint your picture, if that picture is of a turd it's still going to be crap.  Oh, and the packaging.  The packaging is the best part of the album.  It's incredibly cool.
B000AL730O|5.0|I've heard someone call John Lennon the Mozart of the Beatles. But this record truly proves that Paul McCartney was the Johan Sebastian Bach. The arrangements are nicely interweaving. The melodies truly uniqe. This record is nothing short of a miracle. I'm so happy I got to hear it before I die.
0395389496|4.0|This beautifully written 1986 Caldecott Award winning book captivates readers young and old to love this Christmas classic.  The story is told from a young boy's point of view of waiting for Santa to arrive on Christmas Eve, only to find a train waiting outside his bedroom window ready to go to the North Pole.  Van Allsburg immediately draws the reader into the story by capturing the young boy leaning outside his window leading the reader to turn the page and see what the boy sees. The storyline follows the journey of a boy on the Polar Express train to see Santa in the North Pole and receive the first gift of Christmas.  It teaches a strong lesson for those who believe and is appropriate for children while bringing back the warm eager memories of waiting for Santa.  Van Allsburg's award winning illustrations are so realistic and fill the pages to capture the emotions and spirit of the children.  His use of shading to create shadows on each page capture the essence of the Christmas Eve night.  The lights in the background seem to pop out in the background as if one turned on a light switch.  The detailed realistic drawings capture the emotion of the young boy especially when he lost the bell that Santa had given him.  We see him on the train and empathize with him along with the other children as if we were riding right there in the train with him.  Although the illustrations gained the main recognition of the story, his use of rich descriptive language also strengthen the story.  Van Allsburg's use of similes to compare, give vivid details and appeal to the senses of the reader.  For example, one line describes the chocolate cocoa as \\" melted chocolate bars.\\"  The popularity of this book was made into a blockbuster movie and Van Allsburg's talent of lasting artisitic impression and rich language was not lost.  This book will continue to touch readers of all ages and capture the warm spirit of Christmas.
0060090367|5.0|Ok, simply put...I picked up this book at the perfect time.  I had just found out my recently divorced husband already had a new girlfriend, fished through my ever expanding book collection & picked up a Marian Keyes because I needed a good chuckle & I depend on her for that.  I could not have known how close to home Watermelon would hit.  I'm telling you that a paid shrink couldn't hope to come close to offering the truth, humility, and certainly not the laughs that this novel provided at a much needed time in my life.  This book hit home in every way, I kept finding myself saying \\"Oh, how true that is\\".  In short, what I'm trying to say is this is the best Marian Keyes I've read so far & I love all of her novels.  Even if you're not dealing with a slime ball ex, you will adore this book...I promise!!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Sweet merciful Christ.. what a brilliant collection of music. I've  been a Chili Peppers fan for years, and I always knew it was only a matter of time before they went and put out one of the greatest albums of all time. You can talk all you want about your brilliant, unknown underground bands, but it's about time that someone gave mainstream rock and roll a good solid kick in the ass, and Stadium Arcadium delivers. They're pumping out hit single after hit single, and not because they sound like everything else out there, but because they're better than anything else out there. It's as good as Dark Side of the Moon. It's as good as Electric Ladyland. It's as good countless Beatles albums. If anything, it's an improvement on all of the great pieces of music that have come before it, and it sets a new standard. It touches off all of the old Chili Peppers sounds, right back to their pre-fame days, except it takes them to a completely different level. \\"Hard to Concentrate\\" is the most beautiful, sincere love song I've ever heard, \\"Storm in a Teacup\\" is a throwback to Uplift Mofo Party plan complete with cosmic Hendrix-style guitar solos, \\"Charlie\\" will go on to be a classic drug anthem, and the title track is a breathtaking Pink Floyd-style psychedelic epic. John Frusciante, the driving force behind this brilliant piece of music, has officially emerged as the greatest guitarist of our time; an artist who explores the sonic capabilities of his instrument rather than just stopping at technical proficiency. The album as a whole sounds like it could be a damn good greatest hits album, and at least 20 of the 28 songs could skyrocket to the top of any singles chart. Make no mistake about it, this one isnt going anywhere for a while. We're gonna be hearing these songs all over radio stations everywhere for years to come. It's a classic for our generation.

B000EHSVOG|5.0|One of my all-time favorite disaster films of the 70s is presented in an amazing 2-disc special edition.  20th Century Fox pulled out all the stops on this release.  Disc 1 features a beautiful transfer of the film, along with several commentaries.  Disc 2 is AMAZING, featuring countless featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, story boards, publicity trailers, and much more...PLUS a set of mini lobby cards and a replica of the original \\"TI\\" press book are included.  An absolutely wonderful edition of this classic.  \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" is also given a similar royal treatment.  Too bad that Universal couldn't have taken the time and care with their new release of \\"Earthquake\\".
B0000505IM|1.0|Sat down and saw this one on televion. <br /> <br />Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money. <br /> <br />What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats.  <br /> <br />The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional.  <br /> <br />This film Awful.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|I own every Pearl Jam album.  I was always blown away by the passion of their earlier work, but the CDs in later years were passionless.  Each time a new CD was released, reviewers would praise the latest CD, but each work became weaker and weaker, although each had a few bright spots.  Although, Riot Act was dismissal from beginning to end.  I read reviews of the latest work which said the old Pearl Jam is back.  They said the band had the passion and hooks from the earlier days.  They are wrong.  Although Pearl Jam is still better than most \\"mainstream\\" bands on the radio, this work is still very disappointing.  They have tried to regain their passion, but it sounds and feels forced.  It is evident that they are angry about the state of America and the world, but they no longer know how to express that anger in their music.
B00004CWXO|5.0|This is a great submarine movie. Best I have seen. <br /> <br />Though bitter, depressing and often quite scinical, this movie gives the audience the feel of Germany's U-boat arm during the battle of the Atlantic from the whoring and drinking of crews on leave in France knowing they are about to die in battle next mission to the deployment in battle against allied convoys, this movie gives the audience the feel of being there. <br /> <br />Extremely well done.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|More boring than the chicken vs. the egg argument is the Pearl Jam, circa 1991 vs. Pearl Jam, Current debate.  \\"Hey (insert 35-year old pot smoking liberal tree hugger name here), don't you just wish Pearl Jam would sound more like they did on (insert single from Ten, VS. or Vitalogy here)?\\"  \\"I sure do, (insert 38-year old SUV driving, John Kerry bumper sticker-toting executive name here).  I miss the days when they put out REAL grunge.\\"   <br /> <br />Since No Code debuted #1 in 1996, people have discussed, ad nauseum, the decline of Pearl Jam; musically, lyrically, philosophically, morally, orally, florally, etc., etc., etc.  Usually around a table sprinkled with cigarette ashes and copies of the local urban underground newspaper. Thanks to the debut album \\"Ten,\\" the flannel wearing, nose-pierced, liberal arts college attending, suburbanite grunge fans who praised PJ as possibly the greatest rock of all time because of Jeremy, or Black, or (God help me) Yellowledbetter, have blinded themselves to very some solid albums.  The self-titled, Pearl Jam, will inevitably fall into this category of underappreciated albums.  These close-minded Pearl Jam fans who cry for the return of the \\"real\\" Eddie Vedder seem to invariably forget that Jeremy, Black and (God help me) Yellowledbetter have all been used as musak in their dentist's elevator.  These same close-minded Pearl Jam fans forget that each album since Ten has been raked over the coals by the \\"true\\" Pearl Jam fans for being softer than the previous release, less angst-ridden, or too experimental for grunge.  Always waiting for the release of Ten II, these \\"true\\" fans poo-poo everything Pearl Jam puts out that doesn't sound like Alive, and God bless the internet for giving these people a voice. <br /> <br />Just for once, spare me the \\"PEARL JAM IS BACK!!!\\" and \\"GRUNGE LIVES\\" garbage. <br /> <br />For the friend of mine who has placed fantastic albums like Yield and Binaural in the \\"background music\\" category, this album is for you.  The self-titled, Pearl Jam, has a number of characteristics to appeal to the grunge loving fans who can't forget 1991 and those of us who have matured; in life and musically.   <br /> <br />The first is the catchiness of the album.  Radio has consistently shunned songs like Who You Are, Insignificance or Given to Fly from post-Vitalogy albums.  However, songs such as Life Wasted, World Wide Suicide and Unemployable do have a radio-friendly quality that will very likely help songs from the self-titled album to remain on the radio for a slightly longer period than singles from the previous few albums.  For everybody looking for Daughter Reprise, you won't find it here.  But what you will find is a uniquely sounding reprise to Life Wasted.  Suck it up.  You'll like it.   <br /> <br />Second is ANGST.  Pearl Jam is an album the maladjusted, angst-ridden teenagers who despise George W. Bush for, well, whatever their favorite band to tell them to despise him for, will absolutely adore.  Personally, I wish rock bands could go without infusing politics into their music (thank you very much Rage Against the Machine).  Thus, the lack of the fifth star.  However relevant to the age Bush-hating is, it's hard to take Green Day, System of a Down and Pearl Jam seriously when it's put to music.  Anybody who remembers \\"Bushleaguer\\" from Riot Act could see this coming.  Political as this album is, Vedder has done a decent job fusing the lyrics and the music together into a package that doesn't overwhelm the listener with his political bent.  Which is nice (\\"Don't want to be an American Idiot...\\") <br /> <br />Finally - this is for all of the morons who think Vedder's voice has lost an unidentifiable quality only evident in the first three albums - Vedder's vocals are amazing.  Unlike every other 15-year fan of the band, I have never felt like Vedder lost something vocally (or lyrically for that matter) in each subsequent album.  Vedder's voice has surpassed every other arena rock band's leading man...ever.  Nobody holds a candle to Eddie Vedder, and the self-titled album is no exception.  His voice is as crisp as in any previous album: a mix of harmonic screaming and Neil Young.  I got that too:  just cut me off in traffic while I'm listening to No Code. <br /> <br />Old Metallica vs. New Metallica.  Van Halen, David Lee Roth vs. Van Halen, Sammy Haggar.  And very unfortunately, Pearl Jam, Ten vs. Pearl Jam, Everything else.  It's difficult to analyze subsequent albums when a band's first, or second, or third, have such a powerful effect on us.  One can't forget the feeling Alive gave you while smoking their first cigarette, or all the times they got high to Rearviewmirror, I'm sure.  But for 50 minutes, let go of the past and let yourself enjoy a solid rock album.  I promise that you won't be disappointed.  And your co-workers will be happy that you finally have a reason to stop tying that flannel shirt around your waist.

B00005JN2Z|1.0|We all knew form the previews of this movie that Tom Cruse is a hit man and Jamie Foxx is a cab driver. And, that Tom commandeers Jamie and his cab for a night of killing. The problem, for me was when the mild-mannered, soft-spoken cab driver turns into a macho operative and then a super hero.<br /><br />Max (Jamie Foxx) has been a cab driver for twelve years. Although he has dreams and aspirations; that's about all they are. After twelve years he is still a cab drive. Yet, when he picks up a sophisticated lady lawyer, he charms her with his quick wit and knowledge; to the point that she gives him her phone without him even asking for it. I did not buy that for a minute.<br /><br />His next fare is Vincent (Tom Cruse). Vincent wants to hire Max's cab for the night and is willing to pay well beyond Max's usual night-time take. Yet Max resist. (Why? I don't understand this.) Reluctantly Max agrees to Vincent's request but only after Vincent really pushes the issue. Then, everything changes when Max -- by accident -- finds out that Vincent is a killer. And, that Vincent plans on killing more people with Max as his wheel man.<br /><br />Remember, Max is a mild-mannered, passive type of person. So he not only fears for his life but he is scared out of his wits. And so, he allows Vincent to intimidate him into going along on the killing spree.<br /><br />Of course all does not go as planned.<br /><br />Without giving away the plot (if you can call it that) Max is forced by Vincent to confront some very bad people -- on his own. Yet, while being scared out of his wits and surrounded by gun wheeling henchmen; Max is able to bluff the very bad man by putting on a macho act. I did not buy that for a second.<br /><br />After more killings, Max is still scared but decides that Vincent must be stopped. So, without regard for his own life (anymore), Max makes an all out effort to stop Vincent. That, of course, does not work. Vincent leaves Max in a precarious situation and continues to go after his next victim. So Max, in his now obsession to stop Vincent, overpowers a police officer who is arresting him, takes the police officer's gun, and goes after Vincent to stop him. I did not buy that for a millisecond. And I am glad I did not buy this movie.on and continues to go after his next victim. So Max, in his now obsession to stop Vincent, overpowers a police officer who is arresting him, takes the police officer's gun, and goes after Vincent to stop him.

B000F7CMRM|5.0|I went and saw this movie four times. Not because it was that good, although it is, but because I will admittedly include myself among the others who labored to keep the ends tied together on this movie. It's easy to forgive my slow comprehension since I believe the confusion of this movie was intentional, so that neither the audience OR the movies characters have a clear view of the bigger picture. Everyone is lost in the same fog. I'm further clouded with how a movie of this caliber ever made the big screen! <br /> <br />It's not easy to give a synopsis of this movie, and I'm not sure I would trust any review that tries to make it seem as if they have this movie -- or the issues it covers -- all figured out. Instead, I think the movie is speculating about the many anonymous faces and the lives that go with them that constitute the loose political debates we often indulge. From a proverbial 10,000 foot view it's easy to polarize all the players -- this one being good, this one being evil. Sure, there are sub-characters in this movie that wouldn't take much effort to hate, but none of the foreground characters come off as malicious -- and yet, they all make moral compromises that are easily debateble. Matt Damon's character in particular represents a broader version of so many people I've certainly met in my travels whose ambitions seem to cloud the values that we know are at the very heart of them -- or, at least, that's what we hope. <br /> <br />Hollywood movies usually offer a very simple prescription that makes the ingestion of two hours painless and effortless. Entertainment comes first. And if there's a message to be said, it is usually stripped down to the point of passive platitudes.  <br /> <br />Syriana is the exact opposite. It's the cinematic equivalent of active reading. You really do have to pay attention and it does require the brain to work. In my case, my brain put in overtime.
B000001ESF|5.0|2112, released in April 1976, was Rush's fourth album.<br /><br />Before 2112, Rush had released three albums (Rush, Fly By Night, and Caress of Steel).  These weren't bad albums, but they didn't sell like Mercury was hoping for.  If 2112 was like Rush's previous three albums then who knows what would have happened to Rush.  But fortunately, 2112 was a multiplatinum breakout album, and Rush was able to continue being Rush.<br /><br />The album starts off with Rush's twenty minute, science fiction title track, \\"2112.\\"  Neil Peart wrote the lyrics with, quote, \\"Acknowledgment to the genius of Ayn Rand.\\"  2112 starts off with a space-sounding overture followed by the heaviest part of the song titled, \\"The Temples of Syrinx.\\"  The Overture and The Temples of Syrinx are the only parts of the song you ever hear on the radio or on Rush compilations.  Then the song drifts between softer and harder music from the soft Discovery to the much faster Soliloquy and Grand Finale.  (The only place to find the complete version of 2112 live is on Different Stages).<br /><br />The second song on the album is \\"A Passage To Bangkok.\\"  This is a fun, fast moving song, which can be found live on Exit Stage... Left.<br /><br />The next three songs are slow moving and I'm not going into detail on them.<br /><br />The final song is \\"Something For Nothing.\\"  It's my second favorite song on the album along with \\"A Passage To Bangkok.\\"  It's slightly heavier than \\"A Passage To Bangkok,\\" and it contains the best guitar solo on the album other than all the solos on \\"2112.\\"  An excellent live version of the song can be found on All The World's A Stage.<br /><br />In the end, you get the entire version of \\"2112,\\" \\"A Passage To Bangkok,\\" and \\"Something For Nothing\\" for under ten bucks.  That's great considering that this is the only Rush album (studio and compilation) that has the full version of 2112.<br /><br />If you like 2112, then these next albums are hugely recommended.<br /><br />A Farewell To Kings<br /><br />Permanent Waves<br /><br />Moving Pictures<br /><br />Signals<br /><br />Here are some fun facts about 2112.<br /><br />1) 2112 is Rush's longest song<br /><br />2) Lessons is Rush's only song with Alex Lifeson writing the lyrics<br /><br />3) 2112 was Rush's first platinum album<br /><br />4) It took Rush one day to write and record the song \\"The Twilight Zone.\\"> <br />A Farewell To Kings <br />Permanent Waves <br />Moving Pictures <br />Signals <br /> <br />Here are some fun facts about 2112. <br /> <br />1) 2112 is Rush's longest song <br />2) Lessons is Rush's only song with Alex Lifeson writing the lyrics <br />3) 2112 was Rush's first platinum album <br />4) It took Rush one day to write and record the song \\"The Twilight Zone.\\"

Films like this appeal only to the lowest dominator. Films like this insult your intelligence. Films like this should be shunned.  <br /> <br />Lets hope that Hollywood does not insult the families who lost loved ones on 9/11. I fear, however, the worst. The structure predictably will be something like this:- <br /> <br />America gets invaded by evildoers (purportedly based on real events, but is 99% historically inaccurate - see the film U571 as an example), which of course is \\"unprovoked\\" ===> Love story with some plastic actor (insert Ben Affleck or someone of that elk) ensues ===> Stretch film out for further two hours with trite, sentimental \\"God Bless America\\" - type dialogue ==> Hero then gets into plane and destroys evildoers single handed and saves America (and the World).  <br /> <br />Sigh...[shakes head in dispair]  <br /> <br /> <br />

But 15 years later, they came together and recorded a new album in their producers home, where Blood Sugar Sex Magic was recorded, they released an album so great that i am speechless. I meen i cant possibly phathom how great this album truly is. If you at all like RHCP then buy it if you already have not, if you think that RHCP is a bunch of [...] then i say to you, buy this album and i guaruntee that your opinion on this legendary band will change completely.

1932100385|5.0|The central message of this extraordinary book is: consume whole foods in the context of a plant-based diet.  If you do you will greatly decrease the likelihood that you will die prematurely from the \\"diseases of affluence\\" that ravage our society, including cancer, heart failure and diabetes.<br /><br />This is a diet that makes eminent sense and is in accord with what we may surmise was the natural diet of our ancestors in the prehistory before the rise of agriculture and animal husbandry.  Campbell shows through intensive and wide-ranging studies, in particular through evidence from the \\"China Study: the most comprehensive study of health and nutrition ever conducted,\\" that it is a diet that will prevent and even reverse disease.<br /><br />Campbell is no pie-in-the-sky visionary or nutritional quack with a bogus agenda, nor is he an animal rights activist trying to find justification for his concerns.  He is a bonafide mainstream scientist with forty years of experience who is currently Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University.  Furthermore, he grew up on a farm, and prior to his learning about the effect diet can have on human health, he ate a more or less traditional American diet heavy on the meat, milk, fat, refined sugars and starches.<br /><br />I have been reading books on nutrition and diet for decades.  I have seen food fads come and go, and I have seen the rise of the supersize in which McDonald's and other large corporations have seduced us into eating not only foods that are bad for us, but lured us into eating (and drinking) them in large quantities.  As a result we have become among the fattest people on the planet with something like two-thirds of the population overweight and one-third obese. (p. 135)  Part of this is due to lack of exercise, but a significant part is due to eating too much.  But Campbell believes that it isn't just how much we are eating, it is what we are eating.  He maintains that eating exclusively from a whole foods, plant-based diet and maintaining an otherwise healthy lifestyle, we can eat as much as we like and not only keep trim but avoid the terrible diseases of affluence that haunt our society.<br /><br />What is different about Campbell's book is first the enormous amount of scientific evidence he presents, and second the idea that eating not just fats and overly processed foods is bad for you, but that eating too much protein, especially animal protein, is correlated with the scourges of diabetes, cancer and heart failure.  Animal protein consumption in conjunction with various carcinogens in the environment causes cancer, to put it bluntly, is his message.  This surprising finding is supported by Campbell's discovery that the effect of the carcinogen aflatoxin is almost completely negated when a low protein diet is followed.  In particular, his research targets casein, protein from cow's milk, as contributing to the formation of cancerous tumors.  He believes that consuming diary products on a regular basis is dangerous to your health.<br /><br />All told, this is without doubt the best book on nutrition, diet, and health that I have ever read, and believe me, I've read a few over the years.  The arguments presented, over and above the very persuasive evidence, are compelling.  One of the things I like to do when evaluating opposing views on what is good for human beings is to ask myself how was it in the prehistory?  What sort of diet did humans become adapted to over the millennia?  It was only about 10,000 years ago that animal husbandry began; in other words, it's only been about 10,000 years since any people have depended on milk as a food.  Furthermore, although prehistoric humans were hunters and scavengers, it is clear that the bulk of their diet came from gathering plant sources.  Even when they did slay an animal, that animal's flesh was lean, not fatty.  This is not to say that prehistoric humans did not eat animal flesh.  They did.  In some cultures (the Inuit for example) animal flesh was the mainstay of the diet.  But they are exceptions.  Furthermore, the deleterious effects of a diet containing significant amounts of animal products would not have affected prehistoric peoples much since few lived long lives.  Today most people (in the Western world at least) will live into their sixties, seventies and eighties.  How free from pain and discomfort and how active and healthful they will be for how long will depend to some large measure on what they eat.  This is Dr. Campbell's message.<br /><br />Another, more sinister message is contained in \\"Part IV: Why Haven't You Heard This Before?\\"  It is here that Campbell chastises the medical profession, the scientific establishment and the government for being in the pocket of the various corporate interests.  He shows how we have been indoctrinated by the diary, meat, poultry and drug industries into eating an unhealthy diet and attempting to treat the symptoms of the chronic diseases of affluence caused in part by that diet with ineffective and expensive drugs and invasive and dangerous treatments.  He shows how under the Bush administration the recommended daily allowances (RDAs) from the government's Food and Nutrition Board have been revised so that increased amounts of fatty, highly processed, sugared and protein-stuffed foods are now more okay than ever.  (See pages 306-314 for the appalling details.)<br /><br />Why is this happening?  Because corporate vested interests have hoodwinked the medical profession and taken control of the government agencies and have bought off the politicians.  Campbell writes: \\"...[W]hen it comes to health, government is not for the people; it is for the food industry and the pharmaceutical industry at the expense of the people.\\" (p. 318)  He adds, \\"The whole system is paid for by the drug industry, from education to research.  The drug industry has bought the minds of the medical profession.\\" (p. 332)  He concludes (in italics): \\"The health damage that results from doctors' ignorance of nutrition is astounding.\\" (p. 329)mal flesh was the mainstay of the diet.

1400079179|1.0|As a fan of Brown, I was sad to see his cult-like comments about this book in which he proclaims himself the new expert on 2,000 years of history. His grasp of this history is closer to a senior high school student, and was more than a little unusual. I know any author needs to fall in love with the topic, but this one was over the top. Nice fiction effort. I look forward to his future books. I hope he can just drop this X-file level story-line and move on. He is so creative with fiction, that I would appeal that he not quit this area of giftedness for amateur history class.

B00009NDAF|4.0|I'm going to be an intern in IBM starting June and I was told to read this book as an introduction to what Gerstner did with IBM.  Quite honestly, all I knew of Gerstner was the simple fact that he turned around an ailing IBM and made it into the company it is today. This book certainly gave me more insight into the workings of the company and the man who changed the way it worked. <br /> <br />What struck me most is that I felt like I was learning to hold on to the reigns of IBM as Gerstner described he did.  He not only mentioned that he was unfamiliar with the technology coming in as the CEO, but also the large diaspora of products and services it touched.  It felt like both he and I were learning about IBM in that regard, which is something I liked.  As a first time reader, I appreciated the fact that I wasn't lost in the daily business jargon and it made me want to read more.   <br /> <br />Now like a lot of reviewers have mentioned, it's a self congratulatory work, and he makes no qualms about it.  But why should he be modest? He doesn't discredit others when the names need to be mentioned, then why should he leave his name out? After saving a nearly dying 'national treasure' from a never returning point, I think he deserves it all.  He also mentions how he had to fire over 130 thousand people and lay down the law when it came to enforcing his way.  He didn't hide the fact that he was stern, ruthless, and straightforward with his methods, because they were ultimately methods that worked in a big big manner. <br /> <br />Obviously, this is a one sided account of the IBM story of the 90s.  But it is a good one-sided story.  At the end of the day, the story ends happily, and that's what counts.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|SAW really brings back the true HORROR in horror movies. This is not some *teen comedic-slasher* movie that seems to jhust mock horror. This is a real good bloody, gruesome story that could frighten anyone. With that being said, yes, it does have a big CSI influence on it, but still, it is a horror film. Anyways i really like this movie..one of my favorites
B000003TAL|5.0|There is no doubt that I would rate this as one of the best abums of the 80's and Sonic Youth's best abum. However, if you are not a Sonic Youth fan already, I would steer you to their olater albums first. This album is very atmosphereic. It changes moods from mellow and pensive to raging guitar riffs. It has an almost purposeful low-fi sound (think of early albums from Dinosaur Jr. or Guided by Voices). If you are not into experimental, indie rock, go to Sonic Youth's later albums like \\"Goo\\" or \\"Dirty\\". They are more accessible. ( I wouldnt say that they compromise integrity though) However, if you are a music explorer; someone who likes bands like radiohead, there is a reason that Sonic Youth are considered the godfathers(with apologies to Kim Gordon, the female bassist) of underground music. I defy you to talk to a person who loves indie rock who does not love this band, and particularly this album.
0446614459|2.0|After having read Baldacci's \\"Camel Club\\" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really \\"know\\" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article...
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Few artists remain relevant contributors to the world of music after so many years. Neil is not merely relevant though, as recent releases continue to match his greatest works. Prairie Wind is absolutely essential Neil. Of the so dubbed trilogy of Harvest, Harvest Moon, and Prairie Wind, Praire Wind is by far the greatest. The mood is flawlessly set, the lyrics and music complement each other splendidly and every song hits with the impact that great music always does. There's something very unique about Young; no one else sounds quite like him or writes quite like him. His songs just touch me in a way that those of few others can. Praire Wind features some of his most brilliant songwriting. Every single track hits the mark. I don't just recommend Prairie Wind to diehards or even Neil fans, but to everyone and anyone that loves good music.
0440224764|4.0|This is my second Grisham book and just like the first one i read (The Rainmaker) it seems to me everything works out way too easily for his main characters... for them nothing seems to go wrong, everything falls into place way too easily; which makes them kinda implausible...<br /><br />This book starts with a very interesting story; they've just found Patrick in Brazil, a lawyer and ex-partner of a firm in the USA who is accused of having stolen 90 million dollars and murdered a person in the process.  The books draws you in with the interest of finding out how this character pulled this off and, more than just how, why he did it.<br /><br />All in all, i think it's a good book; even though after a while you can easily guess what to expect next..... the only thing that was a shocker was the ending... at least not everything happened the way Patrick planned it....

0812975219|5.0|When FBR came out, it created a sensation among quantitative financial traders, but the arguments are primarily philosophical, not mathemtical or financial. It slowly trickled out to a wider readership and became the classic exposition of the nature of randomness in human experience. People bought it for clever writing and insight into the world of quantitative finance, but the ideas stuck with them because they are important and true in a much broader context. Yes, this book teaches how to make high risk trades without blowing up, but the bigger point is life consists of high risk trades, and there are powerful social forces dedicated to hiding that fact.<br /><br />Inevitably, a reaction set in and you see a lot of newer reviews saying either \\"I knew this all along,\\" or \\"he should be nicer and more humble.\\" While the core ideas have been explored for at least 2,500 years, there is important new insight in this book. And the only reason someone could make these points in a quiet voice today is that FBR shattered the ossified consensus and introduced a new paradigm.<br /><br />While it's true many of the ideas have been reflected in other works, sometimes sanded down to be less upsetting or stripped of philosophic rigor, you should go back to the original. Agree or disagree with Taleb, an educated person today has to know what he said, in his own words. This is a classic people will be reading for decades, maybe longer. Accept no substitutes.
B00012QM9K|5.0|I first saw this film in the theater, on a field trip in 11th grade! First, I applaud my classmates' parents on being open-minded enough to sign all those permission slips. <br /> <br />Before seeing this film, I'd never heard of Oskar Schindler (as I suspect many people hadn't) and had somewhat mixed feeling toward him throughout the film. But the end..oh man! Seeing him break down at the notion that he could have saved more (Jews) with the ring on his finger or the car he's chauffered away in... <br /> <br />The black and white with a hint of color really empowers this film to deliver excellent drama and you can't help but become attached to the characters of the film. <br /> <br />Definitely in my top 5 films of all time.

B000EULJLU|5.0|One should never be quick to judge an album too harshly (or generously, for that matter) without listening to it several times.  In this respect, 10,000 Days is not Tool's best album, but it deserves the best possible rating. <br /> <br />Many reviewers are complaining that they waited 5 years and did not get what they expected.  To those reviewers: your mistake was attempting to predict what Tool would give us.  Since their inception, Tool has been the most progressive and groundbreaking group of artists in music.  If what you initially hear is not aesthetically pleasing to your senses, it should not mean Tool has produced a sub-par album.  As lecturing as it sounds, it takes discipline to appreciate the art that Tool provides. <br /> <br />That being said, this is not an album for a new-found Tool fan.  It incorporates many aspects of their previous albums, both thematically ('Vicarious' echoes the metaphor presented in 'Stinkfist' off of Aenima) and musically/melodically ('Rosetta Stoned' being the obvious example, but there are other instances of this).  There may be a few initial annoyances...one in particular for myself was the overwhelmingly processed vocals at the beginning of The Pot, which I was able to get over.  For some, the vocals are hard to hear on a few songs.  For others, it's the \\"filler\\" tracks (as far as I'm concerned, Tool does not write filler, but to each his own).  What I hope all Tool fans understand is that with how meticulous the band is, everything on 10,000 Days was done for a particular reason, whether it be to open your ears or challenge your thoughts. <br /> <br />Give this album another few listens if you have your reservations.  Bridge Tool's previous albums with this one.  Open your ears and your mind; you'll grow to appreciate 10,000 Days.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I can appreciate and respect bands that evolve and re-invent themselves over the course of several albums. I mean, who wants a band to make a bunch of records with songs that sound exactly the same. it gets boring after a while. unless, the band finds a way to keep things sounding fresh and new, while still un-changing their musical style. over the course of the past 5 albums, from Bloodsugarsexmagik to the brand new Stadium Arcadium, the Peppers have morphed their sound from greasy, hyper-funk rock, to a more sparse, bare bones minimalist rock, with pretty/sad melodies and simple harmonious song progessions. there are some brief, funk workouts here & there, but on this album and on their past 2 albums, the dominant factor are the happy/sad California pop structures. not that these aren't good songs, but the undeniable truth is that we want them to bring back the hardcore funk-rock element so bad. with Stadium Arcadium, the RHCP have settled into their niche comfortably, which have pleased some fans, but alienated others. as mature musicians, they probably have made a conscious effort to shake the sex-funk tag that they have been branded with since the mid-80's. so in a way, we don't blame them for their stylistic shift throughout the 90's, and into the 00's decade. also, history shows that releasing a double-album doesn't hurt either (look at Smashing Pumpkins' Mellon Collie, Nine Inch Nails' The Fragile, and Led Zep's Physical Grafitti). so overall, Stadium Arcadium is a great landmark album for the Chili Peppers, including elements of all of the past 4 albums as well as perfecting what they did with their previous By The Way album. compared to their older albums, it may not hold as special a place in our hearts, however compared to alot of other albums released in 2006, I would say it deserves a spot as a contender for album of the year.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|As the producer of Gorillaz' hit album Demon Days and the man behind the masterful mash of The Beatles and Jay-Z, Danger Mouse has taken a step out of the shadows for the Gnarls Barkley project with his soulful Goodie Mob mate Cee-Lo. <br />Initial Gnarls Barkley single Crazy has already broken sales records for downloads, so has St Elsewhere got any chance of delivering the goods after such a lofty preview taste? Sadly the answer is no, but don't write off St Elsewhere just yet. <br />The glorified brimstone preacher zeal of Go Go Gadget Gospel - complete with pacey horns and a kicking beat - is a spectacular opening salvo for the album before Crazy's ubiquitous sounds kick in. Crazy is a marvellous single that stands alongside Marvin Gaye and Al Greene in terms of invigorating soul, but it's also the highpoint on an album where all other tracks are weighed down by Crazy's brilliance. Among the fragmentary marvels are some genuine highlights. The cover of The Violent Femmes' Gone Daddy Gone, although a peculiar choice for a rewrite, is delivered with percussive precision, The Boogie Monster adds a subtle sexual lyric as its groove fades out and the flamenco guitars and schizophrenic breakbeats of Just A Thought mark it out as possible second single. With the majority of the tracks clocking in at less than three minutes, the short and sharp delivery of St Elsewhere means that many great ideas fly by rapidly without ever feeling fully formulated. <br />Like the act's titular namesake, there's some fancy work, agility and plenty of three-pointers on St Elsewhere, but when it comes to the crunch Gnarls Barkley fails to score an MVP in this rookie season.
B000E1155E|4.0|I bought this album because a guy whose opinion I respect musically after he introduced me to the work of \\"The Band\\" who in my humble opinion are at the pinnacle of rock bands told me this is the first new music he has heard in a long while worth taking a listen to and on my first listen I wasn't impressed, but that had a lot to do with the equalization settings that were programmed into my stereo at the time.  I zeroed my EQ and the mix in the recording came to life and some fairly interesting lyrics became intelligible, at which point I gave it a more thorough listen and got the following impression. <br /> <br />To my ears this is The Beatles \\"Pre-George Martin\\"  in other words this is a fairly soild YOUNG band that could benefit from a World Class Producer, but then again what band couldn't.  I'm not saying they are The Beatles, that has been said plenty, and not really what I would think about the band, just an impression about the benefits of a solid producer for a solid band that is GREEN to creating a pop song and recording. <br /> <br />Having said that, there is a sort of Steely Dan/Frank Zappa/Phish influenced UPBEAT to the music that is interesting. <br /> <br />Having said that, it has a bit of the angst of early Green Day, coupled with a sort of Blink-182 punk pop attitude that has a touch of a No Doubt feel to it as well that I find interesting.  To me, the group is a bit like the Sex Pistols without the in your face attitude. <br /> <br />Lyrically, they have room for growth, but they are clearly writing about their own experiences in an interesting and intelligent way which to me suggests that this is a band that could grow dramatically in terms of lyrics, because they haven't yet grasped the power of endings, they have a few songs with good hooks, but they haven't got anything with a great hook yet, at least on this album. <br /> <br />Using the gold standard to which these young guys have been compared they may be on a par technically with The Beatles when they made \\"Please Please Me\\" but they certainly aren't technically where those greats were when they made \\"Sgt. Peppers.\\"  Again, for a GREEN band they are pretty damn solid rythmically and lyrically they are doing some interesting stuff, while remaining true to their own sound. <br /> <br />I've already said that I hear a lot of Jam influence, and there is a definate punk pop attitude to the album, but I hear disco and hip hop in the rythym section as well, while the group is clearly a rock band.  That for me is quite an interesting fusion which is why I think critics have been hyping the band.  They have a sound that is very much their own. <br /> <br />I personally don't hear \\"The White Stripes\\" as others have suggested in this music, but I haven't listened to a lot of \\"The White Stripes,\\" just what I've been exposed to on the radio, so I may be missing something. <br /> <br />For a band of 19 to 20 year olds to be this solid rythmically is what I think has impressed the critics.  I think that the critics are primarily impressed by the potential which is considerable. <br /> <br />The lead singer has an interesting, voice that is a bit unique, but not completely unique.  The singer doesn't have a powerful voice, but he is a capable singer. <br /> <br />Assuming arguendo that the band wrote all of the material on the album, then lyrically they are pretty solid, but could use some seasoning and additional life experience to fire their creative juices and tighten loose lyrics that are none the less interesting. <br /> <br />For my taste, \\"Riot Van\\" is the most interesting song on the album.  It is essentially the story of teenagers having their chops busted by the cops, and a bit of a universal story because of it, but the song is also revealing because while it is quite interesting lyrically, the ending is weak.  Endings are the band's weakness at this time, and the thing that I believe a world class producer could and should fix in a second album. <br /><br />As a debut effort, I'm impressed because there is a unique sound here, but a touch of formula, just a touch, would bring these guys up a level. <br /> <br />Is it the second coming of The Beatles, no, unless you compare the sales in Europe followed by what looks like a fairly quick catching on in the US. <br /> <br />Does the band have the potential to become a great rock band, yes because they do have a unique sound, and they have an ability to turn an interesting phrase which is the first step towards pop rock greatness. <br /> <br />Other highlights of the Album would be \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" which has a reference to \\"Roxanne\\" that works because it turns that songs themes on its ear. <br /> <br />\\"Red light indicates doors are secured\\" is very interesting rythymically, but I have to also say that the rythym of the song sounds a lot like a riff from a song by a great New York Jam Band, \\"The Niche\\"  who you can hear on their website [...]  Just an observation that leads me to believe that the rythymic influences of funk/jam are strong in the album. <br /> <br />\\"Mardy Bum\\" with its catchy use of the word \\"argumentative\\" is probably the best pop rock song on the album and again quite strong rythymically. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is pretty good too to be honest, and the band at their age with such a solid rythym section shows a great deal of promise.  \\"A Certain Romance\\" is a pretty good song indeed, but very British, and clearly one of the songs that lets you know that these guys are very Tongue in Cheek. <br /> <br />Remember, humor in music is a good thing and I don't think these guys have forgotten that.  In fact, there isn't anything wrong with good drinking music which is what the album is in the end.  They are decidedly a great bar band, which is where all great bands really need to start. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000ELIVB0|4.0|Best known for their beautifully tender Heartbeats (touchingly covered by Jose Gonzalez and used during Sony's Bravia television campaign featuring thousands of super balls filmed bouncing down a Chicago street), Swedish brother and sister duo The Knife have followed up on the vibrant electro styles of 2005's Deep Cuts with an album far more sinister and shadowy. Keeping with their surreal style, Karin and Olof Dreijer began recording Silent Shout in an abandoned carbon dioxide factory before relocating to the underground catacombs of an ancient Stockholm church. Karin's squeaky yet heartbreaking vocals have been thoroughly manipulated on Silent Shout, with the Scandinavian pop overtones of Deep Cuts being replaced by a much darker vibe. The glacial synthesizers of The Captain are as sharp as the band's name suggest, while the frenetic We Share Our Mother's Health - complete with Teutonic vocals announcing `We come down from the north' - sounds like an electro take on Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song. Although the filtered effects and overwhelming darkness of many of the songs make it frequently opaque, Silent Shout's highlight Marble House lightens the mood a little. Featuring Swedish musician Jay Jay Johanson as a guest singer, this future single finds his tender vocals offsetting Karin's creepy sounds. The exciting Madonna-versus-Royksopp style of Marble House, the delicate From Off To On and the skittery beats of the opening title track mean that although Silent Shout has less commercial zest, its enlightened and progressive nature has the power to both confound and delight.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|A delightful combination of sweetness and fun make this film <br />a good bet for a pleasant afternoon.  True, it is not a realistic picture of Casanova, nor does it explore the social or personal dynamics of such a notorious womanizer.  Basically, it's good clean and abundant humor in the glorious setting of Venice.  Indeed, some the visuals are truly spectacular.  Casanova is getting into trouble with women, as usual, then he finds someone he truly cares for...and she thinks him a rake.  So he has to disguise himself as her bethrothed rich fiance whom she has never seen.  (The real fiance is an overweight merchant who sells the best lard in Europe). <br /> <br />The movie pokes some pleasant fun at intolerance, particularly by the Church. Jeremy Irons is well cast as the inquisitor who informs us that heresy is anything that he says it is. Given the choice, I really thought this picture was much better than \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" ...although it clearly is not in the same class as \\"Dangerous Beauty.\\"   In a word, entertaining.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I absolutely loved the last album, By the Way, and never thought I would ever listen to a better album, but Stadium Arcadium certainly is. It's just fantastic!! It was so much better and diverse than I expected it to be. I love every song in it and I don't care how long it is. I don't get tired while listening to it. It's beautiful and fulfilling music. It made me very happy to buy it and I beleieve it can also make you happy, if you take the time to appreciate this wonderful work of art.
B000EO6IE4|5.0|THIS VIDEO IS SUPERB, THIS IS MY FAVORITE CONCERT THAT BARBRA STREISAND HAS DONE. I THINK CMV COLUMBIA MUSIC VIDEO SHOULD RELEASE THIS CONCERT ON DVD. THIS CONCERT HAS ALL HER HIT SONGS INCLUDING THE WAY WE WERE , PEOPLE , EVERGREEN , HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN ,AND SOMEWHERE. BARRY GIBB ALSO APPEARS ON THIS VIDEO TO SING WITH BARBRA THE HITS GUILTY AND WHAT KIND OF FOOL. IF YOUR A BIG FAN OF BARBRA STREISAND I RECCOMEND THIS VIDEO.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|ok first off. i keep reading reviews from some people about how they have been disappointed with every single album that the chili peppers have made ever since Blood Sugar Sex Magik. ok i'm sry but it is nearly impossible to make another album like that. Great albums like that are unique and CANNOT be remade. that's what makes them great! i mean come on. AC/DC could never recreate another Back In Black. And another thing about the disapointment in people about not having another Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The reason none of the cds that the chili peppers have made are exactly the same is because they actually grew up! thats what makes a band great when they can change their style and still put out decent albums. ok anyways back to the review on this great cd. <br />All in all Stadium Arcadium is one of the best albums the chili peppers have ever put out. I'd have to say its their 2nd best of all time. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is their best of course and probably it'll always stay like that. But overall i cant really see any points in this cd thats boring. The best songs on here, in my opinion, are Dani California (they did a great job picking their single), Snow ((Hey Oh)), Stadium Arcadium, Shes only 18, Especially in Michigan, C'mon Girl, Tell me Baby (prolly my fav of the whole album), Hard to Concentrate, 21st Century, Readymade, If, Storm in a Teacup (this is a song that captures the old chili peppers from the Blood Sugar era), and Turn it Again. The 2nd disc, to me, is a better one cuz its a little heavier. The true hero of the cd, though, is John Frusciante. He really out did himself on this one. Of course Anthony and Flea show their usual amazingness BUT John is the star in this Double Album. His solo's are AMAZING! i'm serious. <br />well anyways, if i were u i'd buy it if u like this band. I did and i am totally satisfied. This cd exceeds all of its expectations and more. AND HOW CAN U BEAT THE PRICE OF A 2 FOR 1 DEAL!!!???
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Anyone who gives this release less than four stars, self-proclaimed RHCP fans included, is a moron. And please, for Christ's sake, STOP reviewing albums you haven't listened to yet! I'm tired of reading reviews by people who say \\"I haven't listened to it all yet\\" or they're \\"not sure yet.\\" Whatever your opinion may be, at least make it an INFORMED opinion. That being said, I must reiterate that this is one of the best, if not the best, album I've EVER heard--and this is coming from a long-time fan, a 35 year old-lawyer, practicing musician and former freelance music journalist/staff writer. Not that I feel I have to justify my own opinion, but I get the sense that a great deal of these reviews are coming from 20-year old poseurs who were still wetting their diapers when \\"Bloodsugarsexmagic\\" was released. Get a clue, people. RHCP are the Beatles of the last twenty years.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|Hans Zimmer is my favorite score composer.  I find that when I first listen to a new score of his I anticipate it being like his other scores that are favorites of mine.  Usually I'm pleasantly surprised by his forays into new styles.  This was certainly the case with The Da Vinci Code.  If I were to compare this score to others of his I would say it's closest to Thin Red Line, Hannibal, and Batman Begins.  It's definitely unlike Zimmer's action scores (King Arthur, Gladiator, Crimson Tide, or The Peacemaker), it's much more etherial at times and intense at others without being overpowering.    This score captures the mystery, intrigue, and suspense of both the novel and the movie.    The emotional track #13 \\"CheValiers de Sangreal\\" is certainly the crowning achievement of the entire score.  This track will likely be used in movie trailers for years to come as Zimmer's masterpiece \\"Journey To The Line\\" is.  The CD is worth purchasing for this track alone.    This score merits serious Oscar consideration.  There's nothing out this year that even begins to compares to it.
B00005JOIH|5.0|One of the greatest ironies of international politics in the wake of World War II is that you can make an argument that the most fascist nation on the face of the planet is the state of Israel. This will strike most people as an oxymoronic claim because they will associate fascism with Nazi Germany, which means the Holocaust and the attempted extermination of every Jew in Europe. But as a political ideology that existed outside Hitler's Third Reich such as Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain, and Peron's Argentina, fascism had a specific dynamic that viewed life as an ongoing \\"struggle\\" for \\"order.\\" Mussolini was always proclaiming a struggle for wheat or whatnot, and we all know about his ability to get the trains to run on time. This dynamic stands in remarked contrast to the Whig-Liberal dynamic of \\"liberty\\" and \\"property,\\" but if you recall the Cold War then you can appreciate how fascist elements worked there way in American politics as well. In Israel, where everybody considers themself to be soldiers, life is indeed such a struggle more so than any other nation you can name.<br /><br />The argument that in its struggle to survive the state of Israel has become more like its enemy than it would wish to be in a better world is at the core of Steven Spielberg's \\"Munich.\\" The massacre of the Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich is presented as the opening act on the modern age of terrorism, and you do not need the camera's final shot to show the World Trade Center in the distance to know that this drama is still ongoing. Ultimately, the film is not about what happened at Munich but how the Israeli government responded. There is no small degree of symbolism in which some athletes innocently help the Palestinian members of Black September into the Olympic village. Actually footage of the coverage of the hostage drama, including Jim McCay's unforgettable announcement to the world that \\"they're all gone\\" is mixed with shots of what the terrorists are doing. But the actual deaths of the terrorists and their hostages comes later in the film, as the main character keeps recalling the events as justification for what he has to do and later for what he has done.<br /><br />Fulfilling the injunction of an eye for an eye in the Torah, the Israeli government comes up with a list of eleven Palestinians to die for the eleven Israelis murdered in Munich. Avner (Eric Bana), a former bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) is made the leader of a secret and unofficial group that will track down the Palestinians and kill them. His only link to the government is Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), who will make sure there is enough money to get the job done. Working with Avner are Hans (Hanns Zischler), who can forge necessary documents, Steve (Daniel Craig), who is always eager to pull the trigger, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has gone from making toys to building bombs, and Carl (Ciaran Hinds), who cleans up the evidence and who is the only member of the group to question what they are doing.<br /><br />We question because like the characters in the film we have to take at face value that these men need to be killed. But the first has translated \\"The Arabian Nights\\" into Italian. The second asks the world to note how many Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since Munich. They are not the terrorists, but they do share their ethnicity and perhaps their politics. But what about a man kissing his daughter goodbye makes him a terrorist? Avner gets information about where to find his targets from Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a Frenchman who could be connected to anybody from the C.I.A. to Mossad for all Avner knows. Meanwhile, as Avner and his men cross more names off of their list Black September is escalating its attacks, and there comes a point at which the hunters become the hunted, not that this stops them from pushing on with their missions.<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" is inspired by real events rather than an attempt to document what the Israelis did in response to the Olympic massacre. What I know about the true history is that they succeeded in killing many of their targets, who may or may not have been directly involved in Munich. The screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the book \\"Vengeance\\" by George Jonas, goes out of its way to make the attendant ironies of this endeavor palatable. While they use the same weapons in an effort to terrorize the terrorists, what separates Avner's group from their targets is their avoidance of collateral damage, which becomes impossible. But the pivotal scene in the film becomes not an assassination attempt but an moment of black comedy when Avner's team is forced by circumstances to share a safe house with a group of PLO members. Avner has a conversation with a man who is clearly himself as a Palestenian, doing what he is doing in the hope for a home. Devoid of specific reference to ethnicity or religion, the words could be said (and have been said) by those on both sides.<br /><br />I am reminded of Lincoln's words during his Second Inaugural where he observed that both sides had prayed to the same God, because Arabs and Israelis do not believe that they pray to the same God. Each believes God has promised this dispute territory to them and them along, and the difference between these mirror beliefs that makes us think it will never be resolved in anything other than blood and death is that each holds that there God IS God. The judgment of Spielberg and this film is that the path taken by Avren and his men did not make things better. It is pointed out that those who replaced the dead escalated the violence and the Twin Towers remind us where this road has taken us without an end in sight. The great tragedy could well be that there is no end and suggesting that a particular course of action has made things worse is not a retroactive argument for having done nothing. What is happening could well be as foreordained as any Greek tragedy and those who feel \\"Munich\\" attacks them are projecting what they know in their souls onto what they see on the screen.se to the Olympic massacre.

B000E1OI7G|1.0|Compared to the British series of the same title this is a very bad rip off.  The acting is of poor quality as well as the dialogue.  I would not waste my dime on this, instead I would get the original.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|This is not a typical horror movie. It is a movie that tells a horrible story based on true events, and this is what makes it scary for me...the fact that is based on true events.<br /><br />Yes! After you see it you keep thinking about it, you wonder if the horrendous events you see in the movie can actually be true. It challenges you, and probably makes you question about your faith and what you really believe. After I saw it, I did a little research to know more about the story that inspired this movie and it resulted shocking for me.<br /><br />That's why I give only three stars to this movie because for me this is the kind of subject that I rather see in a documentary than in a movie. Movies are supposed to entertain, and yes, teach you something, but entertaining is what I'm looking and I didn't get it here.<br /><br />You don't want to see the Exorcism of Emily Rose twice; probably you don't want to see it at all. If you are curious, and like this kind of movie, you can rent it, watch it on pay per view, but don't waste you money... it does not worth it.
B0006399FS|3.0|How can \\"single\\" from NY say there isn't a good song on this CD? I can't believe U2 would put out such a bad CD, Vertigo is Kick Ass because of the guitar and the positive lyrics. Come on you Beotch! You must have said that because of your X. Also if you really did dislike it with one play that allways means to play it 2 more times then leave it for a couple weeks or longer and come back to it. The best albums ever made are the ones that you get into slowly, that are complicated. The ones that you love right away become boring. ROCK ON!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|So who told you this was a follow up to Lateralus?  It's not \\"Part 2\\" and going into it with that expectation you will be disappointed.  The album stands on it's own. I have never listened to a Tool album that just blew me out of the water the first time out, it takes a little time and digging around in the lyrics for everything to click. This one is no different. Just give it time. Go out to the Toolshed site and listen to the album with the lyrics pulled up. Listen to it for another month.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I listened to this cd, it's pretty good. You can hear the meshuggah influence, lotsa a fun to listen to. But that's not why I'm writing this review. Some of you Tool fans take yourselves way to seriously. This is commercial music that will sell millions of copies. Stop with the \\"high art\\" crap that \\"takes time to fully appreciate.\\" It just makes you sound pretentious. Tool is playing power chords for God's sake! They're not that innovative! If someone doesn't like tool, maybe it's cuz they don't like it, not because they don't understand their musical genius.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Simply stated...this is the best RHCP album yet! I have been listening to these guys for almost 23 years, and while they have been in a slump for awhile (in my opinion)they have made a full comeback with this album. <br /> <br />Play it loud and play it often...the groove is back and the funk is so funky that Mr. Clinton must be green with envy. <br /> <br />

B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I've read Jane Austin's Pride & Prejudice twice, seen the A&E mini-series with Colin Firth (love him!) and I've now seen Pride & Prejudice 2005 (about four times in one week).  This is going to be a comparative between the mini-series and the movie.<br /><br />First of all, I think it is important to note that the mini-series is approx. five hours long and the movie is approx. half that.  This provides the mini-series with an advantage.  The mini-series is SO true to the book in just about every realm.  One has a chance to get to know the characters thoroughly and fall in love with Mr. Darcy right along with Lizzy.<br /><br />However, there is one major thing missing from the mini-series that the movie possessed:  PASSION!  Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy was bar none, but the young lady who played Lizzy (cannot recall her name at the moment) lacked the passion to match his own.  She also made Lizzy into far too serious a character.  In my opinion, she lacked the spunk that Lizzy had in the book.  Keep in mind, this was my opinion when I first watched the mini-series and watching the 2005 movie only made me far more aware of this opinion.  When Ms. Austin wrote Lizzy, she intended a character who was spunky, light hearted and very intelligent.  Ms. Knightly's portrayal of Lizzy matched what I had always imagined Lizzy being (and looking) like.<br /><br />Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfayden were by far breathtaking in the portrayals of their respective characters.  I was left breathless many times by the slight looks given by Matthew Macfayden and received by Keira Knightly.  Keira Knightly's performance of Lizzy's obvious hatred/affection for Mr. Darcy seeps through the screen into your own heart!  The passion of the 2005 movie version is undeniable!<br /><br />However, be aware that Hollywood did what Hollywood does best:  Fluffed it up and made it their own.  The mini-series version is so deep and involved with the original story line that it is totally engrossing.  However, the movie version brings the story to life with the passion and resonance that Ms. Austin intended.<br /><br />I would recommend watching both.  The mini-series for the depth of character development and strict storyline and the movie for the passion and moral awareness that this story was meant to portray.version brings the story to life with the passion and resonance that Ms. Austin intended.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|1st let me say that i have been a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers since Uplift Mofo Party Plan & the only mistep in their catalog is One Hot Minute. OHM is still a decent album but it sounded like they were venturing in to Jane's Addiction territory rather than sounding like the RHCP. <br /> <br />Having said that i'm not going to break you brain telling how this album raises the level of consciousness in the universe, or how it revealed to me the secrets of life, as other reviewers would have you believe. <br /> <br />this is a great RHCP album front to back from the opening riffs of Dani California on Jupiter to the closing of Death of a Martian on Mars there is not a bad song on this cd. <br /> <br />the songs envelop you, they wrap you up, take you on a journey & give you a release, which is the same thing that every release did for me with the 2 exceptions being OHM & BTW. OHM was an experiment that went the opposite direction & BTW is a transition album to Stadium Arcadium. <br /> <br />now if you look at BTW as a transition album you will hear why SA is one of the best releases of 2006. <br /> <br />Dani California for starters is a perfect melting pot of Flea, John & Chad showing off the punk funk that made them the biggest selling act in the world & also showcases Anthony's vocal stylings from Californication & BTW. <br /> <br />Snow (Hey Oh) is back to traditional RHCP's punk funk with Anthony rapping over top, there are tons of examples of this throughout this 2 disc set.  <br /> <br />Hump De Bump is another return to punk funk <br /> <br />the 2nd disk is funk song-mellow song & it follows that pattern to an extent but the mellow songs are written like Dani California, punk funk musical stylings with mellow vocals & they sound BEAUTIFUL! <br /> <br />to all those who are tossing thsi album aside or giving it less than stellar reviews give it another twirl, to those who have yet to buy it this marks the return of the White Chocolate Punk Funk Gods knownto all as the Red Hot Chili Peppers. <br /> <br />not only is this album worth the price of admission it's worthy of many trips back through the line to ride again. <br /> <br />so go out by this record along with the past catalog take a ride on the Love Rollercoaster with some Funky Monks to see Sir Psycho Sexy with your Uplift Mofo Party Plan in tow & don't forget to get Freaky Styley Under the Bridge. <br /> <br />lastly to quote George Clinton \\"If you fake the FUNK, your nose will grow!\\" <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!

However, The Holy Grail IS a close second. <br /> <br />Imagine what it would've been like to have been mistaken for Jesus! Well, this is what happened to Brian, just an average sod with no real religious or political affiliation. In true Python fashion, things go awry on the turn of a dime. <br /> <br />John Cleese is brilliant as always, especially as the leader of the Judean Peoples' Front (or is it The Peoples' Front of Judea?). I've seen this movie dozens of times and it just never gets old. The musical number near the end is visceral! <br /> <br />Simply genius.

Consider this: 128 chapters, each about a page to a page-and-a-half long. Each chapter alternates between the action at NSA (in America) and a bad-guy chase in Spain. With a page-long chapter, there's only enough time for a few actions, a few lines of dialogue in each. It also features a heroine who is not only brilliant but -- of course -- beautiful. It's never enough to have an intelligent woman; she has to be stunning and in her 30's as well. Yawn. <br /> <br />Susan, the heroine, ostensibly has an IQ of over 160, yet she misses plot points that have the reader groaning at their blatant self-evidence. When in an early chapter, her boss is explaining the details of a corporate double-cross, she answers him with wide-eyed questions. \\"...Different?\\" \\"...Unbreakable?\\" \\"What!?\\" <br /> <br />The plot's conclusion can be guessed long before the final chapters, and you are left with the impression that this novel was written with one objective: ultimately to look good on a movie screen. The characters are not developed and the dialogue is often laughable. I enjoyed \\"Da Vinci Code\\" as long as I overlooked the similarity of Brown's writing style to Sydney Sheldon's; but \\"Digital Fortress\\" has nothing going for it.
B000002IMG|5.0|If you enjoyed headbanging to The Legacy, then don't even think about whether or not you should get The New Order because I will answer that question for you right now: YES! This is another serving of pure and unadulterated thrash metal. Alex and Eric seemed to have kicked up the heaviness of their riffs a bit. They aren't as raw, but they seem to be a bit more aggressive. The songwriting is also a lot stronger on this album. It's just one year later and the band is already showing a good amount of growth.  <br /> <br />Eerie Inhabitants starts with slow and creepy guitar playing. Alex's solo has a very dark and shadowy sound, a great indicator of what the album sounds like. But don't let the slow intro fool you, this song picks up and gets into some heavy thrash. Chuck's singing kicks ass right from the start. My favorite line in this song is \\"Nobody listens to their CRYING!\\" Damn good shirek right there. Alex's solo is amazing and filled with melody. A very emotional sound. And it goes on for almost a whole minute! The New Order immediately showcases the talents of the great Alex Skolnick, as it opens with a killer guitar solo. Right after that, we get some pretty damn heavy riffs that beat you into the ground. For such a heavy song, it has some pretty catchy verses! Alex's solo starts off slow, but soon gets pretty wild while still sounding melodic. I am sure everyone knows Trial by Fire, as it is a Testament classic. It begins with a calm, melodic solo by Alex. But do not be fooled because the heavy riffs soon come in to kick some ass. The riffs may be heavy, but trust me they are still catchy. This song is a bit slower-paced, but don't worry because a fast one is up next: Into the Pit. It starts with some mean riffs, but the song soon speeds up and goes into headbanging mode. Louie's drum work on here is a highlight, and you gotta love Chuck's fast singing. I love the line \\"The mass production and the killing of all.\\" If you want metal that kicks the sh*t out of you, then just blast this song. And Alex's solos! These are good examples of fast-paced guitar solos! Nobody's Fault is an Aerosmith cover. I haven't heard the original, so I won't compare the two. But right away, you can tell the song has more of a hard rock feel rather than thrash metal. It's a pretty good tune, with some catchy guitar playing and some good high notes hit by Chuck. I like the way he sings the chorus, and the solos are played well.  <br /> <br />A Day of Reckoning starts with a cool solo, and then the riffs come to steal the show! A lot of people seem to think this song is filler, but I like it. It's pretty good and catchy metal. Hypnosis is a creepy instrumental. It is just a two minute guitar solo played by Alex, but it is amazing. It's very slow and filled with melody, albeit a creepy one! If you sit back and take this song in, then I warn you, you may get a few goosebumps. Disciples of the Watch starts with another creepy solo, but it sets the song very well. After a few heavy riffs, Louie kicks in with some awesome drumming and the pace picks up. Chuck does some fast singing, and on the line \\"I'll burn you to that cross\\", he gives us a good growl, which hints at how he would sing later on. I know I rant about Alex's solos a lot, but the one he does here is one of his best. It's fast and melodic, I haven't heard too many solos like that! The Preacher is another fast tune. It begins with an amazingly melodic and foreboding riff. Then Chuck belts out \\"THE PREACHER!\\" in that high voice we all know and love. The verses are sung pretty fast, this could very well be Chuck's fastest singing on the album. The riffs played before the solo and during the solo are very catchy. Chuck also gives us some sick shrieks at the end of the song, definitely some of his best. Musical Death (A Dirge) is another instrumental. It is very slow and the guitars have a beautiful sound. Definitely a great tune to kick back to on a cool and crisp day. Eric even gives us anifty little solo! Speaking of solos, Alex does some of his best work on this song, his solos can bring a tear to your eye if you are caught off guard. Even though it is a slow song, it ends the album wonderfully. <br /> <br />The Legacy was a tough album to surpass, but the boys managed. The New Order shows the talents of these guys even more than the debut did. Forget the sophomore slump curse, Testament weren't hit by that! It's a shame metal doesn't sound much like this anymore, a lot of the younger guys should take some notice. I guess all we can do is pray, but until then, we've got these great older albums to put on. Combine some great, melodic thrash metal with one of the coolest album covers, and The New Order proves to be one of the highlights of 1988!
0671799320|4.0|This is a thoroughly readable text starting with the discovery of oil in Titusville, Pennsylvania and ending with the Iranian revolution. I ponder what insight Yergin would bring to a follow-up book but he is secure resting on his laurels. This book is a must-read for anyone wishing to understand the power-struggles in the oil industry. As for shortages, Yergin suggests that there have been several. Once oil became scarce in Pennsylvania, which supplied kerosene for lamps throughout the world, new discoveries followed in turn-in Indonesia, in east Texas, Russia, Iraq, Iran, and the Arabian peninsula. It is small wonder that as the thirst for oil grew, we, in the modern world, became accustomed to new finds. Beyond the new discoveries, Yergin explains how Standard Oil of Indiana saved the day by developing, in the early 1900s, a new process for cracking oil to produce gasoline efficiently. Without this invention, the internal combustion engine would have stalled on the market-long before Henry Ford could dismiss his customer's complaint about the model T by saying, \\"They can have any color they want, as long as it's black.\\" This is also a story about interesting characters. The descriptions of Rockefeller, Getty and the founders of Shell and British Petroleum were very entertaining. But, I am forgetting the undertone in Yergin's book. I enjoyed the tales of how the thirst for oil affected the strategies of the warring parties during World War II. And, how political intrigue between the great powers (England, the US, and others), and the indigenous people, who owned the oil, worked to shape our modern world.<br /><br />Hey, if you found this helpful, please show your appreciation.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Pearl Jam has been my favorite back since high school, but admittedly I started losing interest with their two consecutive mediocre albums (Riot Act, Binuaral). I wasn't sure that they had a good album in them anymore, but luckily this new CD has provem me wrong. My favorites so far are Unemployable, Big Waive, Inside Job, and Marker in the Sand. The only negative I can think of is the album doesn't have a \\"classic\\" PJ song (there is no Rearview Mirror, Alive, Jeremy, Better Man, Corduroy, etc), but either way, after all this time, it is great to see PJ relevant again and I can't wait to catch them live this year.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Most interesting album I've heard in a while. Definitely worth picking up, if only for its unique sounds. <br /> <br />Best tracks: Just A Thought, Crazy, Smiley Faces, Storm Coming. <br /> <br />I'll keep the review short so as not to reiterate good points made about the album already, but keep in mind that this is worth buying if only for the fact that the sound is quite original. This is music that is hard to classify, a la Bran Van 3000. If you're looking for a change of pace from the everyday hip-hop/pop then check this out.
B00005JKG7|4.0|\\"Scary then and still scary now.\\" That's what a lot of people say about this movie, and I have no argument against that. I'm not particularly a fan of \\"ghost stories\\" but this is well done and still looks good, which is why they keep coming out with DVDs on this film and a recent re-make. It's a classic. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the re-make didn't have the cast this film had. Ladies go first in this \\"original\\" with Adrienne Barbeau in the lead as \\"Stevie Wayne,\\" a small- town disc-jockey whose studio is a lighthouse. \\"Wayne\\" has a sexy voice that complements the story and adds a nice touch to it. Then there's the real life mother-daughter duo of Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The male lead is played by someone I am not familiar with, Charles Cyphers, but he does a fine job. John Houseman gets good billing here but he's only in the film the first three minutes! <br /> <br />The \\"star\\" of this film, however, is the silvery, luminescent fog....a special-effect that was eerie 25 years ago and still has that effect. The films only lasts 90 minutes to the story zips by, the violence is effective but not overdone and the suspense is terrific. <br />
0060764899|5.0|C.S. Lewis does a remarkable job at describing the characters, events, and seasons in the story. It is appropriate for both young and old, and should be experienced by all.
0714843377|3.0|Good book, easy to read. I finished this book in less than 2 hours. The other reviewers are exactly right, this book is targeted to advertising workers.  Good, but not great.
6305095442|4.0|Though this was not the first modern horror film to use parody (Dawn of the Dead, An American Werewolf in London are examples), the lengths to which is goes are wildly imaginative. Just like Re-Animator spoofed the sci-fi/horror genre, Evil Dead 2 takes on the slasher film genre and sends it up way before the Scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer/Scary Movie cash cows. For those who liked the \\"tree\\" sequence in the first Evil Dead movie, imagine it being magnified over and over again. Using the stop motion animation technique in a deliberately crude fashion, Evil Dead 2 is still wildly imaginative.  A person tries to fight off their own severed hand. Visions appear from nowhere. The first sequence in speeded up time is dizzily unnerving. If you don't like slasher films (believe me this is a hell of a lot better than any Friday the 13th film, take your pick) or if you're one of those old blue haired types ranting about \\"video nasties\\" then stay away. However, if you want a good, gorey and even sometimes scary descent into madness then Evil Dead 2 is for you. For real film fanatics, one might note (though on a far more intellectual level)the sense of the world collapsing and turning against the protagonist(s) of the film can also be found (albeit much more arty and far less gorey) in the films of Jan Svankmeyer. As for the casual horror buff, Evil Dead II is a classic of the subgenre of splatter films with a sense of humor which would be taken to new heights with Rob Zombie's \\"The Devil's Rejects\\". Leave the lights on.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I originally posted a review where I gave this album 3 stars, but it has grown on me and I think it deserves 4 (I only give a 5 to albums I consider classics). Stadium Arcadium does show how the band have matured so much over the years and now that I am 30 years old it's hard to believe the Chilli Peppers have been around since I was in junior high! Not many bands out there have that type of longevity, but the Peppers seem to get better with age. My favorites on this album are Charlie, Strip My Mind, Wet Sand, Tortue Me, Desecration Smile, She Looks to Me, and Animal Bar. Some have complained about filler and though some songs are better then others (as with any album) I don't think this CD has any throw away songs. My only complaint is that I wish there was a few more flat out rock songs instead of the mid-tempo songs that mostly dominate, but that is a mild complaint as from beggining to end this is a highly enjoyable album. Recent weeks have seen the release of album from Pearl Jam, Tool and now the Chilli Peppers so it's nice to see that rock is alive and well. Stadium Arcadium is one of those albums that will remain in my CD player for a long time to come.  <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Im getting shivers thinking about this album. My ex-boyfriend got me into tool with Aenima almost 10 years ago. I love Undertow and Aenima. Lateralus was a little disappointing, but this is back in full force. Powerful and beautiful at the same time. Takes many many listens to fully appreciate
B000EULJLU|5.0|I will be the first to admit to you that I was like many others after one run through of the new album.  I felt a little annoyed by the \\"filler\\" that took up a couple tracks on the album, and many other tracks didn't really catch my ear.  I kept telling myself to leave it in my player and give it time.  Slowly, each track started to show new things to me that I hadn't heard the first times through.  I found myself pressing replay on several tracks over and over again to get a second helping.   <br /> <br />Several reviews I have read of this album have stated it is like A Perfect Circle or an album for new Tool fans.  I completely disagree on both accounts.  APC is much more melodic and a completely different sound.  I also don't think this album is something that someone new to Tool is going to like either.  This album, in my opinion, is for people who love Tools ability to make an album come alive after hearing it several times and hearing it the way it was meant to be heard.  It is an evolution of Lateralus.  It continues on with tracks that seem to never end, and when they do, you feel like they passed by quickly.  The highs and the lows on this album keep you guessing.  For me, Tool is more like art and less like music.  I too enjoy songs with repitition and more traditional sound, but this is something I can put on and almost feel.   <br /> <br />If you are new to Tool, I suggest you start with an older album and work your way up to this album.  If you have enjoyed the evolution of Tool through the years, this album is the next chapter in a very awesome ride!
0064400557|5.0|Charlotte's Web is a book about friendship which encompasses all the good characteristics of a classic story: adventure, comedy, drama, miracles, compassion and love, life and death. I believe E.B. White did a remarkable job in creating a story that would be loved by adults and children alike for many, many years.
0060536357|5.0|Nearly two decades after the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, Wall Street is back where it started.  The people have changed, but greed and scheming to get to the top is constant.<br /><br />I found the book extremely well written and incredibly researched.  Though I'm a frequent reader of the WSJ and a veteran of M&A and venture capital, I learned more about what happens on the inside in these mega-mergers and leveraged buyouts than anywhere else.<br /><br />The only fault of the book is the flipside of its strength.  There is so much in-depth detail on so many characters that I found it difficult to keep track of the players and their roles.<br /><br />If I had to recommend one book on how Wall Street runs, this would be the book.
B000EULJLU|3.0|After what seemed like forever, but was really just another 5 years, we finally have a new tool set. Now thousands of tool fans can purchase the latest so thousands more can get their pirate copies, but was it worth the wait?     While waiting we have been given Perfect Circle and maybe it's just me but it seems that Maynard is using the best stuff in Perfect Circle and leaving tool with the b-sides these days.  Don't get me wrong 10,000 Days is respectable enough. As with Lateralus, tool seems to have matured their angst and anger but like the goth who grows up to be a stockbroker something is lost.    Yes, the 'tool' feel is there in the melodies but the bite is missing.  Now it's true that no one could possibly sustain the tone of undertow or opiate but perhaps that's what I still crave; that every 5 years I get to hear a bit more rightous indignation done with the style only Maynard can create.     Still, when all is said the worst tool is heads above anything else out there and this is in no way the worst.
0385504209|1.0|Dan Brown's book has not one grain of historical fact in it!  Yet people are actually believing this stuff.  It's all fiction.  I also do not like the fact that the book continually bashes Catholics.  If this book was saying all of the Quaran was wrong this book would not be read by anyone.  Do not see this film.  Or read this book!
B000ENV2P0|5.0|i have remained a hardcore frusciante fan since he left, yet found the peppers albums since his return more and more disapointing (not entirely, just mostly).  <br />then..this album. WOW! if you have given up on them after bssm or even before, you must give them another chance! by far the best thing they have ever done. too many favorite songs to list, although slow cheetah is currently my fav. <br />now, about the expensive version... <br />i hate to say i feel ripped off because the music contained is worth every penny and then some, but, well...i feel ripped off. <br />an extra $30 or so for basically a dvd is what i feel like i got. <br />the packaging just makes getting to the cd's harder, the dvd is just ok, nothing great. another funky monks type documentary would have been pure magic, the album being recorded in the same mansion, etc. the \\"28 page booklet\\" is merely the lyrics and credits and some photos, basically what they probably added in a smaller version on the regular version of the cd. the \\"original artwork\\" also could've just been part of the cheaper versions booklet (and maybe it is). everything else is just junk trinckets not worth the extra mony. marbles, blank paper, and a wooden top.  <br />anyways...i cant recommend the more than double price sticker for a crummy gimmick, but the actual album has got to be one of my all time top 5 albums already, and this coming from someone who basically gave up on them after bssm. buy the new cd without hesitation, but proceed with caution on throwing down your money for an overpriced box of junk is all im trying to say.
0307277674|5.0|I read this book recently and could hardly put it down. The auther led me on a thrilling chase through several european countries and also through history. This book is great fun to read.<br /><br />I've noticed that there seems to be a lot of confusion among the readership over the historicity of key aspects of the book. Just keep in mind that this is a work of FICTION. No reputable biblical scholar believes that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married; or that the Holy Grail refers to Mary. This is pure imagination on the part of the author.<br /><br />Another reviewer on this site pointed out how Mr. Brown changed the floor plan of the Louvre to make the story better. The historicity of the book has similarly departed from the best scholarship.<br /><br />So--enjoy!  Just don't confuse fantasy with reality.<br /><br />LRK
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Buyers are definately getting their moneys worth and more for this 2 disc special edition which is loaded with extras. One of the best disaster films made during the 70s, it still holds up well today and is notable for atmosphere and a sense of place as well as an incredible cast. Not only does the film include the big names of the day (like Paul Newman, Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway) but the stellar attractions are great performances by some of the grand stars from the classic era - William Holden, Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones (in her last screen appearance). The extra features include original featurettes made at the time of the films release in 1974 as well as the recent \\"AMC Backstory\\" which dishes out the gossip about the behind-the-scenes antics and attitudes of the cast. A \\"We Remember\\" segment includes interviews from Richard Chamberlain, Susan Blakely, Susan Flannery and Robert Vaughn. Also included are a set of mini lobby cards and a booklet with articles about the story and cast. An audio commentary by film historian FX Sweeney is interesting and entertaining. Scene specific commentary is provided for many of the action scenes. A significant improvement over the older dvd release in both picture quality and a wealth of extras!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I absolutely love this album, if i were to separately rate the discs, disc 1 would get 5 stars and disc 2 would get 3 stars. <br /> <br />The main problem i see with this album is with some weak spots on the second CD, it starts and ends strong, but there is a 4-5 song lapse in them middle that leaves you wishing that they had kept the momentum going.  <br /> <br />is it the best RHCP album? by far, but i think that the track order was poorly chosen and it seems that more well produced tracks were placed together.  <br /> <br />High Lights... \\"Dani California\\" \\"Snow ((Hey Oh))\\" \\"Charlie\\" \\"Torture Me\\" \\"Warlocks\\" \\"Tell me Baby\\" \\"Hard to Concentrate\\"
0316096199|5.0|I read this book in one weekend.  It was impossible to put down, and though it brought back some awful memories, I was glad to have read it.  Sebold writes very openly about aftermath of her rape and the ripple effect it can have not only on the victim, but the people around her.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|Think Eternal Sunshine.  Or Vanilla Sky.  Stay is a movie that is much along the same lines as these.  I never saw any previews for the movie, and I am glad I did not, based on some of the other reviews.   <br /> <br />Stay is a movie that deals with the portion of life that exists between life and death.  The movie is full of symbolism and dualism.  It is the type of movie that providing too much plot actually ruins the ending. <br /> <br />I will say, though, if you are looking for a horror film or a movie you will not have to think much about, then this movie is NOT for you.  However, if you love looking at life from a different perspective and wouldn't mind seeing a movie at least twice (it's virtually impossible to catch everything the first time), then you will love this movie, and it will make its way to your top 10 favorite movie list.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I wanted to like this movie, and I was prepared to accept a less than strict adaptation of the book, but I couldn't forgive the ridiculously indecorous little additions to a work based so heavily on the complexities of manner and conduct in Austenian society.  I didn't mind the family's poorness being enhanced to bring understanding to a modern audience of the wide breach between Bennett and Darcy, but I thought Knightly's coarse, greasy banged version of the subtle and witty Elizabeth went beyond the boundaries of \\"youthful\\" or \\"exuberant\\" and marched straight into the realms of the just plain inelegant.  For example, who thought it would be cute for Knightly to smack her food and lick her fingers at the breakfast table?  That kind of thing has nothing to do with youth or a modern adaptation--it's rude even today.  A main part of the original story was that Elizabeth and Jane had manners far superior to their family's, and were not themselves the objectionable ones.  Darcy even says as much at one point, a comment which was included in the movie's dialogue but hardly demonstrated in its acting.     Elizabeth Bennett is one of my favorite literary characters, but all the things I like the most about her, her careful cleverness, her grace under fire, her classy superiority to the huffy rudeness dealt out to her by the upper class, were all but lost in this 'sassy farm girl meets stuck up rich dude' version of Austen's infinitely more subtle work.  In truth, this movie had a lot to live up to given the success of the BBC version (a fact which can be seen in its complete omission of that now famous scene where a dripping Darcy meets a shocked Elizabeth at his estate), but in my opinion, in its effort to do so, it simply overplayed its hand.
B000EULJLU|4.0|With all the negative reviews going around, I'll start off by saying that no, I am not a ToolSheep. In fact, Tool isn't even in my top 10, as far as favourites are concerned. <br /> <br />To be honest with you, I liked this album. I liked it a lot. Don't get me wrong, though. 10,000 Days (which of itself is a rather poor title) has nothing on Lateralus which is by far Tool's best work. With that said, I'm not going to take anything away from this one. <br /> <br />People posting reviews need to judge the album and not the band. I know there are a lot of ToolSheep on here who brag about Tool being the band of all bands, and that they saved the world again. Not quite. <br /> <br />My favourite songs on this album were Wings for Marie (pt 1) and 10,000 Days (Wings pt 2). Coincidentally, these two tracks were probably the most laid back and most anti-climactic songs on the record. This is what strikes me as interesting. I must say that one of the first things I noticed about this record was the lack of climactic interludes. Tool is known as a climactic band, one that \\"takes you somewhere.\\" A classic example is the song \\"Lateralis\\" off of the previous album. Listen to it and pay attention around the 7-minute mark and you will catch my drift. 10,000 Days doesn't really grasp climactica, if you will. This record is rather difficult to get into, even by Tool's standards. <br /> <br />I thought the riffs and the vocals for \\"Jambi\\" were excellent, complementing the opening song \\"Vicarious,\\" which is somewhat similar to Schism. I do, admittedly, notice some Lateralus on this album. A lot of it is subtle, though. Mostly a riff here and a passage there, but nothing too serious. <br /> <br />I think the lack of climax and the seemingly drawn-out experience of this album undermine it, or could undermine it, to say the least. I found myself waiting and waiting on certain tracks for something to happen - primarily in \\"Roseta Stoned,\\" \\"Right in Two,\\" and \\"Intension.\\" Now, \\"Roseta Stoned\\" did pick up nicely. \\"Right in Two\\" did so as well (although to a much lesser extent), but \\"Intension\\" hasn't done it for me. Neither have the transitional tracks in the middle of the album. But I will tell you that \\"[Wings pt 1 and 2],\\" coupled with \\"Vicarious,\\" \\"Jambi,\\" \\"The Pot,\\" and \\"Roseta Stoned\\" make the album worth it for me. <br /> <br />It lacked climax. It lacked progression, and it seemed to give me a feeling of \\"Is this it?\\" upon my first listens, but it is a very good album in my opinion. The songs grow on you, and I found myself liking the tracks a lot sooner rather than later. In fact, I really didn't like \\"The Pot\\" too much at first (because of Maynard's voice at the beginning) but it is now one of my favourite songs.  <br /> <br />I guess this one was worth the wait. It's no Lateralus by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a very good record. It won't crack my top 3 for 2006 which is a disppointment on its own (in respect to Tool's standards), but I still enjoyed listening to it. Maybe it's because I'm not a Toolaholic I'm able to accept this album and find what I enjoy about it (without resorting to monumental expectation). I still expected post-Lateralus brilliance, but I didn't get it. However, I am not disappointed with this release. Good album. I'll listen to it plenty.
B00003CX95|3.0|This is  good rollicking tale, violent and bloody but it is just a story. I have mixed feelings about it having worked in the Scottish tourist industry. Braveheart was good for the industry but I have spent a lot of time explaining that the movies captions have nothing to do with reality. Showing a date suggests some sort of accuracy and this is not so. The inaccuracies are well documented so I will not bother to repeat them. But a thought for all you red blooded males. Having been hanged and drawn you don't just grit your teeth and yell freedom when they hack off your genitals and start pulling your viscera from your belly.

B000EMGAGW|5.0|Don't pay no attention to the haters this album is literally FYA!  There is not a track on the album that I don't like.  Some I like better than others, but that's how it is with all albums.  They're not kids, you can pick a favorite song.  Well I'll break it down track by track for ya. <br /> <br />1. Smoke It- 5/5 A great opening for the album.   <br />2. Put 'Em In Their Place- 5/5 A good single for me, but not for radio play, they didn't get it with this one.   <br />3. Stole Something- 4/5 Banks comes on with a nice verse on this one   <br />4. Creep- 4.5/5 Beat is annoying at first, but you'll get used to it.  50 has a good verse on it.   <br />5. Speaking So Freely- 4/5 I like the hook on this one   <br />6. Backstage Pass- 4.5/5 Hot beat, good song overall   <br />7. Give It To Me- 5/5 This is the 2nd single off the album, it will help get it more sells.  Great beat.   <br />8. Click Click- 5/5 P and Yayo spit some real verses on this track   <br />9. Pearly Gates- 5/5 One of my favorites, good verses from 50, Hav, and P (especially P, although they edited it)   <br />10. Capital P Capital H- 4/5  Nice beat, P gon tell u how it is.   <br />11. Daydreamin'- 5/5 Another one of my favorites on here.  Tellin it how it was when they were dreamin of becoming rappers.   <br />12. The Infamous-3.5/5 Not one of my favs, don't like the beat compared to the others on the album.   <br />13. In Love With The Moulah- 5/5 Another of my favs, a metaphor comparing money to women.   <br />14. It's Alright- 5/5 Yep u guessed it, another one.  MJB does a good hook on this one for sure.   <br />15. Have A Party- 5/5 Nate Dogg what else to say?   <br />16.

B000EULJLU|5.0|If there is one thing that has always been true about TOol it is that their songwriting and stylistic choices are flawless.  I have never heard a better band when it comes to developing a consistently powerful and moving shape for their sound, and that shape differs from album to album.  A lot of Tool fans seem to have forgotten this.  10,000 days blends the band's ambient and melodic sensibilities with the staccato math rock sounds of some of their notable opening acts from their last tour, like Meshugga and Fantomas.  What results is a consistently heavy and intimate sound, different from the distant ethereality of Lateralus, although comparisons are inevitable.  The band has evolved enough to no longer rely on the Build-up/Release pattern followed closely on Aenema and Lateralus, their songwriting has become much more flexible and mature.  I think it would be very easy for a band of TOol's talent to continue in the same vein as their previous works and maintain the support of many of their recently (relatively) acquired fanbase, but 10,000 days is an effort in a different direction.  I think it is as much more exciting and honest album because of this.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie deserves a star in recognition of the work the crew put in and for nothing else. <br /> <br />Seeing the shorts was enough for me, there was no way I would actually pay to see this movie. But tonight I watched some of it on TV and cried with laughter. Why? The storyline was dire, the acting was embarrassing and the dialogue made me think of steaming elephant excrement. It is difficult to find the words to describe how truly awful this movie is. It is worth watching only for the side splitting laughter factor and very relaxing. The only serious element is that some poor deluded fools might think that this is historically accurate. All it does is to illustrate how badly prepared and complacent the USA was in 1941. But any accuracy is totally submerged by the pure garbage that surrounds it and you would have to be mentally retarded to take any of it seriously. If laughter is a health tonic though this is the elixir of life.

B00005AQF7|2.0|I remember when I was a youngster in 1993 and everybody and their mama were listening to and buying this album. I was eleven and I bought the cassette single to Gin And Juice, and enjoyed it terribly. I was ELEVEN. You would have thought Snoop was the second coming of Christ or something back then. <br /> <br />But Snoop Dogg isn't Christ. He's a misogynistic ghetto moron who makes money off of the image of pimping and disrespecting black women. Remember when he showed up at the VMA's with dog collars and leashes around those women's necks? How fitting for a dude who treats women like animals anyway. Very classy. See, if you listen to MOST of his vomit-inducing music, you understand that Snoop sees women as objects to be sexed and exploited, not beautiful human beings to be loved and understood. That's why when he DOES pay homage to women in songs like Beautiful, I take it with a grain of salt because I know that's not the real him. And all of this is something I couldn't grasp when I was eleven. <br /> <br />Snoop Dogg is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you; so you go and find a \\"nice girl\\" because you can respect, marry, and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with  \\"bad girls\\" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the \\"bad girls\\" because they're sluts, so you go back to the \\"good girl.\\" But she's not nasty enough for you, so...around and around we go. Women are basically being punished for men's refusal to make up their minds or to live in the 21st century. <br /> <br />Since the way a man treats women usually starts with experiences with his mother, I'm led to believe he must have witnessed his mom selling herself on the street corner for an ounce of crack. It screwed up his image of women forever. The best treatmentSnoop can give a woman he claims to love (his wife) is to cheat on her openly with groupies and make porn in the backyard. <br /> <br />I guess the whole pimp, hoez, gangsta, cursing 400 times on one album thing is admirable and entertaining if your i.q. is equal to your age.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I'll explain my views, I won't apologize for them. <br />
1592401791|5.0|I am a big Beatles fan and have read most of the books about them.    This book does a great job of explaining the Beatles' recording process in a unique and insightful way that is enjoyable to the recording professional or someone who simply appreciates music.  It has been a long time since I learned anything new about the Beatles from a book.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This film has stuck with me more than any other film I have ever seen in my life. I watched it 5 days ago and simply cannot stop thinking about it. I wanted to immediately watch it again once it was over. I just didn't want the story to end, especially the way it did.  <br />The characters Ennis and Jack, superbly played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, the absolutely stunning directoral work done by Ang Lee, and the heartwrenchingly beautiful musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla, have all been swimming in my head and heart nonstop these last few days and nights. I have been profoundly affected by this film. <br />I plan on seeing it again and again and listening to the original score and reading the story over and over again as well. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good love story.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|Seriously, who ever thinks that this album is not Placebo's Best, definetly does not understand Their intentions. <br /> <br />This is an album of pure evolution. if you did not like it, it means you dont understand Placebo. <br />yes, it is different to their past albums, but that is what happens. musically Placebo is very much further away than they where with Sleeping With Ghosts. <br /> <br />This determines Placebo as one of the most important bands out there. <br />Seriously, if you did not like it, listen to it again, if you think their lyrics lack substance, it means you dont understand where Molko is heading. Brian Molko is heading to the abstract in lyrics and that is just genious. saying more and more with less. its amazing how Brian can say Soooo much with so little. <br /> <br />and well, what can i say about songs like \\"Pierrot the Clown\\" real genious, this album helped me out of the dark <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I liked their previous albums, but this album blows my mind!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is definitely the best album of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't turn it off. If I do turn off the CD player, the music is still playing in my head. Thank god, after those horrible new albums from Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam. I now have an album I can listen to for the rest of the year.
B000002MTR|2.0|I'm really surprised to see how many good reviews this album is getting amongst most of the reviewers below, especially the ones mentioning its supposed funkiness. To be frank, I've waited eagerly for a new RHCP album at the time of this release, and never thought they would even match \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\", let alone outclass it. BUT GOD, to say these 13 tracks (two more got scrapped at the last moment before release) were an utter disappointment would be an understatement. Call that \\"free metal\\" or \\"deviant funk\\", or else, it's stunning to think they took so much time after \\"BSSM\\"'s success to dare recording such a tuneless mess; \\"Warped\\" is arguably their worst single EVER, and tracks like \\"Deep Kick\\" and \\"Transcending\\" made me wonder why, compared to that, The Butthole Surfers weren't hailed as the new Beatles in their heyday (joke). Only \\"My Friends\\" (which sounds anyhow like a suspicious \\"Under The Bridge\\" re-hash) and the exquisite \\"Walkabout\\" surface from this. Fortunately, they got back Frusciante and went further in their pop-funk grooviness afterwards.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|I would give her first album a 4 out of 5 but this one is much better if i could i would give it 7 out of 5. Honestly at first I didn't like the song \\"SOS\\" at first but now I think it is a great song.  The fast pace songs like \\"SOS\\" and \\"Break It Off\\" are catchy and you can dance to them. The ballads like \\"Unfaithful\\" and \\"P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You)\\" are nice to listen to and show just how well Rihanna can sing. I will admit that there is one filler track on the album. That track is \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\". Rihanna is great but this track does not do her justice. Even though that is a filler track this album is deffinately worth buying.
B00028HBKM|2.0|Why all the horrible blood and gore? Straight out of a B zombie zombie movie. Yeah, I get that it's supposed to empasize the pain and suffering that Jesus went through to cleanse you of your sins but was all of it needed? The movie The God Who Wasn't There did a minute-by-minute tally of blood, violence, gore, etc. All  but the first 10 minutes and 6 later minutes contained things you'd expect to see in a horror movie. Gibson=sadist?

B000002KB8|5.0|Don't let anyone tell you any different. It all started here. Led Zeppelin, The Who, and even Pink Floyd are often cited as being prime influences on the then-fresh and evolving state of heavy metal, yet these comparisons are false, just about every band from the era being much more influenced by blues, early r&b, and their predecessors in the rock and roll community. While Sabbath are masters of all the above named crafts, their dark, occult-themed lyrics, Iommi's sludge-like but delightful guitar playing (especially for a guy missing two fingers!), Osbourne's once-upon-a-time demonic howls, and an extremely heavy for their time rhythm section, Sabbath holds all the trademarks of an early metal band moreso than anything else. Although it may sound primitive compared to today's standards of metal, where lightning fast, thunderous blastbeats and finger-twisting shredding are the norm for an exceptional metal band, the fact that none of these bands would be around today without the influence of this first record says much more about the band than their lack of virtuosity compared to todays standards. <br /> <br />This would be the worlds introduction to Ozzy Osbourne's trademark, off-key vocals, which since then have secured his place on the throne as the King of Darkness, and while Paranoid may be the definitive Sabbath album for many fans, the roots are really laid here, with this debut, indisputably one of the best from any band of the era. Tony Iommi's guitar playing is the definition of the era in which he became a legend, and his melodic if gritty riffing and sharp pentatonic solos are groundbreaking, keeping in mind that only recently before this albums release two fingers on his critical fretting hand had been torn off in a machine accident on the last day of his factory job. <br /> <br />Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are in my opinion one of the best rhythm sections in the classic rock era, second only to Bonham and Jones, Ward's drumming being truly ahead of its time. Going into a track by track review is pointless, as anyone who hasn't heard each and every one of these classics by now has been dwelling in caves for the last 40 years, but among my favorites are Wicked World, which features exceptional classical guitar picking to counter the rollicking blues riffing dominating the verses, the title track, whose sounds of thunder and ominous church bells would become staples of the metal scene in years to come, and The Wizard, upon which Osbourne's harmonica playing give the early metal ballad a decidedly unique back country twist. <br /> <br />Black Sabbath would go on to create many more great albums and many more unsatisfactory ones throughout their career, which was plagued by constant disputes within the original lineup before finally reuniting for their present day original arrangement, but this self titled record is the definitive moment when heavy metal was born. Slayer and Metallica may have taken it to the next level, and Zeppelin may get the credit for it, but this is truly the gem of the early metal scene which absolutely cannot be missed.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|I'm fan of Zimmer's scores since 1992 (my favourite composer with Jerry Goldsmith).I have all his scores and I will go to Madrid to see him. <br /> <br />I'm happy to say after the past year little dissapointment with batman begins, hans is back at his best! <br /> <br />Da Vinci Code is his most mature, complex, rich and moving score to date.(in my opinion better than The thin red line) <br /> <br />I can't understand why internet reviewers doesn't rate this score with at least 4 stars, I guess a lot of Zimmer detractors and haters around.But I don't have enough words for say how amazing is this new Zimmer score.Just listen it. <br /> <br />THANKS HANS FOR YOU CRAZYNESS AND YOUR SENSIBILITY ! <br /> <br />(My Favourites Zimmer's scores are: Prince of egypt, the last samurai, Beyond Rangoon, Da Vinci Code, King arthur, k2....) <br />

B0007MWZEK|2.0|I've had the Swivel Sweeper for 5 months now.  As stated in the other reviews, the commercial totally \\"oversells\\" this product.  It has not broken or anything... It just doesn't do what you \\"imagine\\" it would do based on what is presented to you on the advertisement.  It will pick up a tiny amount of material before spitting it back out in another area of your house while you continue to \\"sweep\\" with it.  Well, when I vaccum, I let my 2 yr old play with it so she feels like she's \\"helping mommy\\" - Other than that, it's junk.
0446310786|5.0|Jean Louis, a little white girl, witnessed the discrimination that an African American was accused to rape a young while woman whose family had bad reputation; however, the African American did not rape the woman who was hurt by her father. Would the African American be set free with the help of Jean Louis' father, Atticus, who had good reputation in the law area or be put in jail? Would this event affect Jean's pure life? This book is full of childhood, happiness, and sadness. Moreover, the more you read, the more surprise you would get.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I liked this movie but the sexual situations means that you should not allow children to see it.  The sad part is that by eliminating the two porn movie stand-ins (whose characters are undeveloped anyway) this movie would have been better and more appropriate for teenagers.    In fact that is about the only false note in this movie.  There are just too many couples to follow in one sitting.    That said, I laughed out loud thru much of this movie.  Some people have compared this to Four Weddings and a Funeral but I enjoyed this more.  The pairing of the author and the housekeeper who cannot speak to one another is funny throughout the movie as is the guy who thinks that since he cannot find love in England it is simply because he is on the wrong continent.  Hugh Grant is dead on as a new Prime Minister- he looks as uncomfortable playing the role as you would imagine a man newly elected to the position would really feel.    Great flick!
B000E5N62U|4.0|Having been a Steely Dan fan for a few decades now...I am always interested in what they are up to.  I have owned the first two solo efforts from Mr. Fagen for many years. It's not my purpose to address them here.  Morph The Cat is an interesting CD and in my opinion is a lot better than the last one he put out on his own.  The arrangements, production, instruments, and writing are all outstanding.  The title cut is a bit morbid and not a standout on this one.  The songs H Gang and What I do... are getting quite a bit of airplay in this neck of the woods.  Both are very good songs! Brite Nitegown is a bit weird, but okay.  The jazzy song... The Great Pagoda of Funn is another good song.  Security Joan is obviously a song inspired by Homeland Security..very timely!  The Night Belongs To Mona...this song has shades of Peg, from the Aja CD.  Mary Shut The Garden Door...is an okay song. This is a good CD overall from an artist who is true to his style of music!!!  Thanks Donald for all the great years of music that you have given to us all.  Hopefully, their is much more to come!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have to say after hearing and reading some reviews of this album I was ready for a bit of a letdown. But, this album is as good as everyone has said it is. Probably the best double album released in a very long time. Their are a lot of songs on here that can be singles. Both discs are great and I will disagree a little bit with one of the reviews I read saying that this album was a return to older days foe the Peppers. While that may be true to a certain degree it is not entirely true. This album expands on the music they have been making since John Frusciante returned. While all of the members have truly outdone themselves on this album it is Frusciante who truly stands out and shines on every song. So buy this album and enjoy.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|A beautiful progression of music.  The energy and spirit transmitted through Stadium Arcadium will enchant your ears.  This is a must have for any Chili Peppers fan and anyone with musical interest.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|Funny but small children should not be allowed to see this - particularly the DVD which added back some scenes that were not in the theatres.  This is not a \\"puppet movie\\" like the Muppets. Small children wouldn't understand very much about this movie since it is a satire. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed the goofiness of this movie, the reason people should buy this DVD has to do with the extras on it.  Unlike most DVD's which have deleted scenes, or actors talking about their characters-- this movie had DVD Bonus Features which showed the actual set design problems, filming techniques used, and the thought that went into the design of the puppets.  It was very informative for people who wish to work in the film industry or just movie lovers who want a true feel for what it takes to film a movie (even one with puppets)! <br /> <br />This movie was fun in a dumb sort of way-- just as a satire should be.  It riffs on Hollywood liberals, action flick dialogue, and its depiction of North Korea's leader Kim Jung Il is a hoot.  It is funny to see how many people opposed this movie when it came out (Hollywood liberals, the North Korean government, etc.). <br /> <br />Again, not for children!  The sex acts that the puppets performed were so gross at times that grown women I watched it with ran from the room.  Grown men were disgusted but laughing. <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|A masterpiece! That's probably the only word I can think of to describe this new TOOL album. And I'm absolutely sure most of the listeners will have a different opinion about it. After all, this kind of music will require you to sit, relax and pay attention. I must confess that when I first listened to Wings Part I & II, I didn't enjoy \\"it\\" and quickly skipped the songs after the first minute.    This pair of tunes slowly builds up to become two of the most sensitive songs ever created by TOOL or any other band. I can only compare this level of music - progressive in its most part - to a band like Led Zeppelin, given the ability to successfuly craft a 10 minutes song and transform it into an epic.    Like a movie, these two songs have memorable moments. In Wings I, that part when Keenan with multiple voices roaming around and singing \\"... What have I done\\" sends a shiver down my spine. \\"10000 days in the fire is long enough... you're going home\\" in the second part with that background vocal through the last word actually brings a tear to my eyes. And I'm not really sure why.    The lyrics perfectly fit the music, sometimes complementing well a riff and leaving a question mark over our heads, as always.  VICARIOUS and JAMBI are for this album what THE GRUDGE and LATERALUS were for the band's last one, in my opinion. Flawless and unpredictable. THE POT reminds me of old times TOOL, a rock song that is a joy to sing along.    And ROSETTA STONED has to be one of the most complex and eerie songs this band has ever created. It shines among the best of TOOL's work.    A couple of Melvins-inspired fillers can be found too. And I'm glad to report that they flow well between the songs.    Don't mind some the nay-sayers or reviewers of some popular metal websites stating that \\"TOOL is the Radiohead of n?-metal\\" cause they are musical orcs with their minds probably lost somewhere in the 60's.    If you enjoyed Lateralus, I bet you'll enjoy this one. For me, this one is even better than Lateralus although it makes no sense to compare them.    One last thing: there's no bassist and drummer who can  fit together so well as Justin and Danny in the world today. Don't give up the first time you listen to this album. It has so much to offer beyond the first spin.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|...that hears Alan Parsons music throughout most of this CD?  Most Pink Floyd fans know Alan Parsons, if only through the terrific engineering work that he did in DSOTM.  David Gilmour also collaborated with Alan Parsons on the first cut of Parsons' latest effort, A VALID PATH.  This cut, entitled RETURN TO TRUNGUSKA is one of my favorites by either performer, and made me wonder why it took them so long to get together.  It was pure magic and the absolute highlight of A VALID PATH. <br /> <br />Then I purchased ON AN ISLAND and my first impression was that this is Gilmour's tribute to Alan Parsons.  I was stunned.  All the musical nuances were there, and much like Alan Parsons' later works, it took some time to warm up to several of the cuts on this album.  But warm up, I did.  I asked my son about this (he too is a big Pink Floyd and Alan Parsons fan), but he didn't see the similarities.  Perhaps you won't either, but to me there is little doubt. <br /> <br />ON AN ISLAND is not a typical Pink Floyd album.  There is little immediate \\"Floyd\\" gratification and entire CD is extremely laid back.  But it's full of rich, subtle textures, and of course is personified with the wonderful guitar work of Gilmour.  It begins with the soaring CASTELLORIZON, then blends in nicely with ON AN ISLAND (my personal favorite of this CD).  THE BLUE (more wonderful and soaring guitar work) would work very well on Alan Parson's ON AIR album.  TAKE A BREATH was the first cut that had no Alan Parsons in it and I found it impressive.  RED SKY AT NIGHT is highlighted with a haunting sax.  THIS HEAVEN is very bluesy with a Parsons' overtone.  THEN I CLOSE MY EYES once again shows subtle and beautiful guitar and piano work.  SMILE is even more subdued, yet I enjoyed it just the same.  A POCKETFUL OF STONES is pure Parsons' \\"B\\" material.  I suspect that by now many felt that this CD was dull.  WHERE WE START (the last cut on the CD) doesn't do anything to change this muted feeling, but damn ifI didn't end up enjoying this one as well.  There is a real \\"lonely\\" feeling throughout this work.  And while there is nothing near Gilmour's/Parsons' magnificent RETURN TO TRUNGUSKA that is on the Parsons' album, I found this latest work to be surprisingly satisfying. <br /> <br />Thanks, David (now hurry up and release PULSE!).  Between 1 and 10, I give ON AN ISLAND a pretty solid 8 (although I admit that on my first listening I would have been hard-pressed giving it a 6.  If you're looking for hard-hitting Pink Floyd, you won't find it anywhere on this CD.  For many, it may take some time and several hours of listening before fully appreciating this work.  For many others, they simply won't like it (as seen by the number of one-star reviews).
B000EMGAOY|5.0|First of all, I would Like to say that some might complain that the red hot chilis only release an album every 3 or 4 years, but is it worth the wait..... certainly!  After hearing the band saying that it was their best work yet and was i let down or dissapointed.... certainly not!  I thought that 'californication' and 'by the way' and of course we cant forget their greatest hits would be the pinnacle of the chili peppers carrer!  How wrong was I?  Stadium Arcadium tops and betters both of these albums.  There is something for everybody in it.  For the lovers of slow rock, we have 'Snow [Hey Oh], Slow chettah and Desceration Smile'  For The lovers of hard rock we have torture me and for the lovers of the funky style we have tell me baby and Dani California along with a host of other good tracks.  Stadium Arcadium excells in every department and is easily the best rock album if not the best album of the year.  The chili peppers have proved themselves once again!
B0006HXXBA|5.0|i love kreator, but they fell off my radar sometime around renewal. i like outcast but never even took the time to listen to whatever was between the two. i heard they had a new one out that kicked ass. violent revolution. (hang with me i'm getting to this one.) when i finally took my time to get v.r. enemy of god was already out. violent revolution kicked my ass. and i was hoping enemy of god would be half as good. i could never have imagined something better. it's not only better than violent revolution it's better than anything i've ever heard. yes kicks even slayers ass. my mp3 player says i've listened to each track 57 times.  cause you have to listen to each one every song is so Fing good i can't tell which one is my favorite. like watching a bikini contest with hundreds of hot chicks you think one is your favorite until you see the next one then she's your favorite. thats how this cd is my favorite song is the one thats on till the next one starts. this is the greatest metal album ever!!!!
B00005QK5X|5.0|A very addictive set of records... Particularily 'Is this Real?' and 'YOA'. It's beautifully flawed stuff: self-romanticized teenager music that takes itself too seriously; but damn, is it awesome. <br /> <br />Very sincere. Honest, sometimes angry and most often naive. Very thoughtful changes, sometimes almost amatuerishly ornate. Oh yeah. And they also rock. <br /> <br />Listen to any of these records once, and I can understand if you aren't blown away. Listen three times, and if you're not madly, hopelessly in love, it's because you have no soul.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|A psycho (played by John Malkovich) plans to kill the President, and Clint Eastwood, an aging, almost over-the-hill secret service agent, is trying to stop him. Malkovich torments Eastwood - Eastwood was on duty protecting Kennedy when he was shot in Dallas, and he didn't react accordingly when the shots went off; Malkovich knows it and drives him batty about it. Eastwood's been carrying that psychological scar ever since, and now he has a chance to redeem himself.<br /><br />In many of Eastwood's movies it's hard to sympathize with him because he's either so cruel and antagonistic or else almost unscathingly superhuman; here he does win our sympathy because finally he IS more human and like the rest of us: he's out of shape, he gets the flu, it takes a while to win the girl (Rene Russo). It's a nice change. There is nothing unique about the story or the way the plot unfolds: crazy man on the loose, Eastwood and cops try to track him down - though it's done very well. The tension is maintained, yet the director (Wolfgang Petersen) takes time to develop the characters, especially Eastwood. Of course there's the wow finish: Eastwood takes the bullet meant for the President (he's only wounded), thus redeeming himself. It's a very well-done thriller; definitely worth a watch.

B00005ATZT|3.0|Anyone who truly enjoyed the TV series THE FUGITIVE, starring David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, as I did (I still think it was one of the best dramatic series - ever), will probably be disappointed in this movie remake starring Harrison Ford as the maligned doctor intent on finding his wife's real killer, as I was. Tommy Lee Jones plays Lt. Gerard, the police officer determined to bring Kimble back after he escapes from prison (on the TV show he escaped after the train he and Gerard were riding transporting Kimble to prison wrecked). Kimble saw a one-armed man running from his house the night his wife was murdered, and is convinced he's the killer.<br /><br />The movie becomes nothing more than a thrill-packed chase flick (some might say that's enough). Jones's character is much more interesting than Ford's. Ford does some very improbable things, such as going back to the hospital while on the lam and going to the jail to talk to a suspect with one arm - things that would have been thought too crazy for the TV show audience (and rightly so). Janssen's portrayal of Kimble was superb: there was a constant nervousness about him, a relentless fear exuding from him as if expecting disaster around every corner, and a bone-weariness that captured Kimble and his dilemma perfectly. Ford displays none of those qualities, and comes across as a man who is out to prove his innocence, by golly, you wait and see -  despite the fact that it's almost a given from the start. And, of course, he does, and it's a dummy conclusion: it ends up he was the target of a drug scam by a big pharmaceutical company. What a drag. That never would have washed in the TV series.<br /><br />I would recommend the TV series over this movie any day, but unfortunately the TV series isn't available on DVD. Why that is I don't know, but I hope it becomes available soon. Real soon.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Alright.. having been a fan of RHCP since Blood Sugar sex Magic. I have to say this is by far their best album. Not that i own all of their albums though. I have \\"Freaky Styley\\", \\"Mothers Milk\\", \\"Blook Sugar Sex Magic\\", \\"One Hot Minute\\", \\"Californication\\", \\"By The Way\\", and now \\"Stadium Arcadium\\". So I'm no expert.. but i at least have a good idea of what they are capable of. And this is simply their greatest album, and by far the best album i have heard in the last 10 years. <br /> <br />And how good is it? Well 28 tracks and 2 hours later. Every single song rated as an 8-10 on my scale. Not a single track that i don't enjoy listening to. Also.. Anthony is at his absolute best as far as singing goes. He can rhyme like no other, and his voice is still going strong. The back up vocals from Johny, and his AMAZING guitar solos. And Fleas bass playing are simply stunning. And Chad on drums is doing as good as i have ever heard. All in all, every single song has a catchy beat, amazing lyrics, beautiful, creative, full of energy and it just kicks ass!! <br /> <br />You don't even have to know the words, and you find yourself nodding your head, tapping your feet, and trying your best to sing along, even if you don't know the words yet!! I'm actually sitting here listening to the second Disk. And whoever said it was more mellow.. is smoking crack. More experimental yes.. mellow.. no! The Mars disk is actually quite good. I cant pick which one i enjoy more. Hell.. if they could take every track and put it on one disk.. it could be considered a greatest hits album for all i cared. \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Californication, and now Stadium Arcadium are easily my favorite albums. In a top 10 list. Stadium would easily be on top. Along with Foo Fighters, \\"the Colour and the shape\\" NIN \\"The Fragile\\" Pearl Jams \\"10\\" along with my 200+ artists that i love listening to. So they make a good standing in the top. What can i say, i love music. And i like to think that i have good taste. And if you think so.. Buy this album, tell your friends! Its about time artists are rewarded for making pure music. No politics, no preaching, nothing more than feel good music with the best musicians in the industry. Enjoy! <br />
B000E1155E|5.0|What a blast of fresh natural energy and variety, that rips and roars from the very beginning. \\"Whatever People say I am That's what I am not \\" by the Arctic Monkeys is an album with good songs and music from a bunch of guys who are just out of their teens. The singing is so natural, young and spontaneous. You sometimes get a feel that they are a mix of the band \\"Oasis\\" (for vocals) and the band \\"Offspring\\" when it comes to music but then, they are not. The Arctic Monkeys are original in their own way. The musicianship is top-notch with exciting guitar riffs, meaningful solo leads, lovely bass lines and good drumming. I watched some live footage of the band and the drummer is a must-watch/hear. Believe me his drum kit has only one tom! So much from such a modest set-up.  <br /> <br />Most of the songs on the album average 3 minutes or less in length. Short songs work and eventually what you get is 13 songs. Who said \\"13\\" was unlucky. Even the slow songs exude style. <br /> <br />My favourites are \\"When the Sun goes down\\", \\"Red Lights Indicate the Doors are secure\\", \\"A Certain Romance\\", \\"From Ritz to the Rubble\\", \\"Mardy Bum\\", \\"Riot Van\\" with a touch of melancholy in the last two. \\"Perhaps Vampires is a bit strong but..\\", \\"Fake tales of San Francisco\\" and \\"View from the afternoon, the\\" are contenders for second best songs. The rest are listenable too. <br /> <br />Lyrics are spontaneous and natural and certainly not Kitsch. And who says bands of the past cannot be jabbed at. Didn't we like it in the 70's when Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits jabbed at \\"..those trumpet playing bands...\\" in \\"Sultans of Swing\\". <br /> <br />So what can Coldplay learn from The Arctic Monkeys? Originality, of course!. AM are not copying another band or being someone else. If I were a member of Coldplay I would simply quit the band and become a fan of the Arctic Monkeys. Like another reviewer put it, hype is the only flaw of this band. Eagerly awaiting their next offering.
B000093OU8|4.0|As Gary throws us another curve ball, he prooves that he can indeed reinvent himself over and over again. <br /> <br />On this outing, Gary shows us he doesn't need a drummer.  That's right, nothing but drum machines on this one, but you'd be hard pressed to hear it as such.  The drum progamming on this is nothing short of brilliance.  I wonder if a drummer did the programming? <br /> <br />While this album does have some leanings toward's his previous album \\"Run For Cover\\", it shows us some new direction for Gary.  A Celtic/Irish feel permiates most of the album and as usual, Gary's guitar playing does nothing short of amaze and astonish.  The man can simply play that guitar second to none.  :)
0345409671|5.0|After stalking and killing a ruthless but enthrallingly passionate mobster named Roger, Lestat is approached by his ghost. At the same time, he is becoming increasingly paranoid that he's being followed by the devil himself, and he is growing interested in Roger's daughter Dora, a devout and popular television evangelist, who he wants to spare from embarrassment. Lestat and his companions try to protect her \\"church\\" from the fact that her father was a killer.<br /><br />Eventually, Lestat meets the devil, who calls himself \\"Memnoch\\". He takes Lestat on a whirlwind tour of heaven, hell, and the main epochs in the evolution of the universe. The tour offers a retelling of the entirety of biblical history from the devil's point of view in an effort by Memnoch to convince Lestat to join him in a noble quest. In his journey, Memnoch claims he is not evil but merely working for God by ushering lost souls into Heaven. Lestat is left with the confused choice of whether he will help the devil or not.<br /><br />After the tour, Lestat believes himself to have had a major revelation. Among other things, he believes that he has seen Christ's crucifixion and that he has received Veronica's Veil; he has also lost an eye in Hell. He tells his story to Armand, David, and Dora, who have joined him in New York. Dora and Armand are deeply affected upon seeing the veil; Dora takes it and reveals it to the world, and Armand goes into the sun in order to convince people that a miracle has occurred.<br /><br />At the end of the novel, Lestat and David go to New Orleans, where Maharet returns Lestat's eye to him along with a note from Memnoch. This note reveals that Memnoch may have been manipulating Lestat to serve his own agenda. Lestat then loses control of himself and Maharet is forced to chain him in the basement of the St. Elizabeth's convent, which is owned by the vampires, so that he will not hurt himself or others. When he is at last released, Lestat enters a prolonged coma on the floor of St. Elizabeth's (in which he remains for the next few installments of the Vampire Chronicles).<br /><br />It is later stated that during Lestat's coma, he is actually outside of his body. During which, he is forced into labor by angelic beings (stated in Blackwood Farm).<br /><br />Although the novel fits in the Vampire Chronicles storyline, the vast majority of it consists of the \\"tour\\" Memnoch gives Lestat of heaven, hell, and of the cosmology and theology behind it all.<br /><br />The novel follows up on claims made by David Talbot in The Tale of the Body Thief that God and the devil are on better terms than most Christians believe; it also reinterprets biblical stories to create a complete history of Earth, Heaven, and Hell that fits neatly with the history of vampires given in The Queen of the Damned.<br /><br />Reference:[...]<br /><br />This book is truly inspiring,I would recommend it to new and old readers alike,enjoy...Nigeln the floor of St. Elizabeth's (in which he remains for the next few installments of the Vampire Chronicles). <br /> <br />It is later stated that during Lestat's coma, he is actually outside of his body.

0273617109|4.0|I read the Pyramid Principle in 1995 and dutifully trained myself to use it, with a little help from a class with Ms. Minto.<br /><br />The hardest part was realizing that the Pyramid Principle isn't about forcing your current writing into Minto's structure; it's having the courage to tear your argument apart and recraft it if you can't support it in a properly constructed pyramid.<br /><br />It took effort and practice to master, but it was well worth it. My writing has been widely published, and my articles are often praised for their clarity. The clarity comes from Minto, plain and simple.

B0000033P0|5.0|There is nobody, NO-BOD-Y, better at the keyboards than Keith Emerson. This has been proven on every album ELP's ever released, from the first eponymous one with \\"Lucky Man\\" on it, to \\"Love Beach\\". How this man keeps from getting carpal tunnel syndrome, I'll never know, for the aural histrionics are incredible! On this album, their second and one of their best, the magic of Lake's sonorous, nasal low tenor, Emerson's adeptness and overdubbing and Palmer's percussive punctuation, helps the ELP formula take shape, though there isn't a classical cover here, like there is on the first album,\\"Trilogy\\" and \\"Love Beach\\", but there is \\"The Only Way\\" and \\"Time and Space\\", which SORTA sound classical.<br /><br />Has anybody ever noticed how much Greg Lake looks like etchings or paintings of protestant reformer Martin Luther? He seems to have the same sort of fire the medieval rabble-rouser had in his vocals as well, like he's trying to foment demonstrations all over the place in the group's songs. But the scary thing is how the entire group looks like they just stepped out of the road company cast of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or a very grand Dungeons and Dragons game! Chances are ELP was and has been the Muzak of the D&D crowd for years, anyway, so it all fits!<br /><br />The grand work on this album, \\"Tarkus\\" takes up the first side, going from the track \\"Eruption\\" to \\"Aquatarkus\\", whatever that is, but you don't care what it's about, you just groove to the stream-of-consciousness rant of Lake's singing and Emerson's mind-boggling keyboard work.<br /><br />It turns out that \\"Tarkus\\" is the name of that strange combination creature on the cover of the album, an armadillo with the bottom half of a Sherman tank, who is an analogy of the brutality of war. Another creature, called a Manticore, (at one time, the name of the label WEA Records allowed ELP to form for its releases,) drives this marauding juggernaut away, saving the people and the countryside from its destruction. You know what...you really couldn't care less about this tale! You just groove on the incredible music and talent involved in the production! This album, along with \\"Trilogy\\", \\"Emerson, Lake & Palmer\\", \\"Love Beach\\" and perhaps \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" are among the best things you will ever hear issue out of a hi-fi speaker, classical, rock, jazz or otherwise...<br /><br />The second side has the incredible \\"The Only Way\\", a song that asks the musical question: \\"Can You believe...God makes you breathe? How did he lose...six million jews?!\\" and my personal favorite from the album, \\"Bitches' Crystal\\", a song apparently celebrating the world of, you guessed it, DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS!! With a \\"heretic priestess\\", tortured spirits that cry and ghostly images dying, the arrangement sees Emerson flashing his fingies across the piano keys like some unreal Padarewski, faster than anybody I've ever heard play keyboards.<br /><br />Save up your shekels, and buy \\"Emerson, Lake and Palmer\\", \\"Tarkus\\", \\"Trilogy\\", Brain Salad Surgery\\", and \\"Love Beach\\", and just sit back and be dazzled by some of the best musicianship to see a Billboard chart!<br /><br />I really can't praise these guys enough!dn't care less about this tale!

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Stadium arcadium is an absolute gem of an album.This is the album that has finally led me to join the already vast legion of pepper's fans around the world,and one that will undoubtedly gain the red hot chili peppers a much broader fan base while also getting them a whole bunch of well deserved awards.Through the sheer maturity,sophistication and grandeur that coexists and prevails in these wonderful 28 groovy & hooky anthems,the red hot chili peppers have topped themselves by delivering an album that is hard not to like or resist. Furthermore,it is an album that simply said,redefines the meaning of what modern rock & roll music is supposed to sound like,which in itself; is quite an achievement coming from a band that has been around this long.If you don't believe me,just go to aol.com(full listening party)and listen to the whole album for free before you buy it,and you'll see why i speak so highly of this wonderful album.After you've done so,I simply dare you to find an album as relevant,enjoyable and satisfying as this one.Enough said.

B000EQH2QK|2.0|Shakira has definite potential for making good music (Laundry Service), but Oral Fixation isn't it!  Hips Don't Lie and La Tortura are the only two songs that are worth listening to on this cd.  Laundry Service is a better Shakira cd because it has a mix between Spanish songs and English songs.  But making an English singing cd cold turkey isn't cool.  She wanted to explore both fields and that's fine, I'm cool with that.  But Shakira, please go back to singing in Spanish!

B0000AQS0F|3.0|Like me title says, it reminds me very much of the Japanese animation series Cowboy Bebop.  Pretty entertaining to watch, I'll have to admit, but I did not enjoy it as much as many other reviewers did.  I don't disagree with most of their comments but its not quite my taste.  That's just what it is, taste.   <br /> <br />So what did I not like? <br />- I am not so much a 'western movie' friend.  Somehow, horse riding, double barrel shotgun, trench coat... was not too appealing to me, especially in a sci fi program. <br />- The attempt to put some Chinese (language, custume...) in there was interesting, but executed poorly.  I speak and read Chinese.  When the caption suggested that they are speaking in Chinese, I could figure out 30% if I try very hard.  My suggestion is: either do it with some effort or don't do it.  While it may be interesting to some, it quite offensive to those who actually speak the language.  I assume that by using Chinese-like name and language implies some characters have some sort of Chinese inheritage?  How hard is it in today's market to find an Asian actor to play even one of the character?  Imagine making a movie with an attempt to include African American background by occasionally including some poor Southern accent, and have actors with darker skin to 'play' an African American character...  Yes, that how a Chinese would feel watching that aspect of the program.  <br /> <br />Other than those, I actually enjoyed the show. <br />

B000EULJLU|5.0|As other reviewers have stated, you shouldn't be quick to judge 10,000 Days after just one listen. The beauty of all great music is that unlike the mind-numbing pop and rap that is lowering the standards of humanity, it takes time for you to absorb and appreciate. If you want instant gratification, go summon an old Limp Bizkit record. If you are patient and open-minded, you will be richly rewarded with the music of 10,000 days. Believe me, this was worth the five year wait.

B000EULJLU|3.0|I gave 10,000 days a 3 out of five because it does not meet up with the par of previous Tool albums.  From my count, 6 out of the 11 songs are actually songs.  Yet, The six are excedingly harmonious nevertheless.  The rest are melodies, random lyrics, and cacophonous sounds.  If you have recently encountered Tool music I suggest you buy this cd but purchase some of their earlier albums first, like Lateralus, Undertow, Opiate, Salival, and Aenima.  Nevertheless, if you buy 10,000 days first, keep in mind that this is not the pinnacle of their ability.

Even back then, you can taste the magic. If you like U2, you will love this album...For the casual fan, buy it, and see what all the fuss was about...

B000001FS3|5.0|If you only have one U2 album in your collection, this has to be it...There comes a moment every once in a while when everthing falls into place and lightening strikes...In the 90's it was the Joshua Tree. We all know the big ones 'With or Without You', 'I Still haven't Found', 'Where the Streets have no Name', but what about 'Red Hill Town', 'One Tree Hill', 'Mother's of the Disappeared'. There are no fillers on this album. Classic U2 - Music at it's best...Our grandchildren will be buying this in 30-40yrs time. Timeless, cannot recommend highly enough.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't help but notice new customers reviews are posted daily--and not one is negative.  I just finished watching the series today, but unfortunately my discovery of the brilliant writing and multi-dimensional characters is four years too late to prevent the show's cancellation.  It's a shame that this series was given so little chance.  Highly recommended for any looking for a departure from the profusion of average television programs on today.  A warning however, be ready for an abrupt ending that will undoubtedly leave you wanting more.
B00080ZG10|2.0|With the exception of Cate Blanchett (as Katherine Hepburn)and some of the spectacular flying scenes, I found this film over-long, boring and irritating...(ok, it won 5 oscars but the only one that really mattered was the best supporting actress one).DiCaprio, indeed a good actor, was unconvincing as Howard Hughes and gave a lacklustre performance. I struggled to get to grips with this film as it meandered aimlessly from one scene to the next. I expected better from Scorcesse. If you like watching paint dry, you will love this movie...otherwise, stay clear...

B000001E18|2.0|This is Edge's album (his pet project)...He drove the recording process and initiated much of what can be heard here. The album was pretty much recorded between tour dates and it shows. Bono said that Europa was a natural successor to Achtung Baby (well, Bono gets it wrong sometimes). Achtung Baby was classic U2. I can summarise this album in 3 words 'Numb', 'Lemon' and 'Stay'...after that it is a non-event.<br /><br />I agree with experimentation, but Edge - you just gotta let the other guys in (you are better as a four-piece). For U2 Fans only....By the way, the less said about the Johnny Cash collaboration, the better...
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Steven Spielberg once again impressed us with this raw, but very moving and exciting movie, inspired by the 1972 olympic games. The special effects are intense, plus there's this whole big story behind, very complex, you have to be very focused since the first minute to understand it, but it's very good.<br /><br />This is not a tragedy, it is based on a tragedy, but it's mainly a drama, about a man who has to \\"kill to survive\\" and be safe. It's actually a bit long, but you can watch it complete very easily; there are no boring parts at all.<br /><br />But I would recommend it to people and teenagers capable to judge between good and bad...or else we could find a kid imitating and putting bombs everywhere!<br /><br />It's a very good story, and Steven Spielberg surely did a great job in this movie.
B000001EAQ|2.0|For starters, I love U2. They are without doubt the most influential band in the world today. But, not all U2 albums can be classics. This is 'experimental' U2, and some of it works and other bits don't. 'Discoteque', 'Please', 'Staring At the Sun' and 'Gone' are all terrific but the rest meander into meaningless self-indulgent fodder..I have tried to like this album but have given up....For U2 fans only, otherwise get the best tracks on their Best-Of albums...
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Syriana is an eye-opening look at the nature of the international oil industry. The film has the feel of a behind the scenes documentary where the viewer is able to watch key players abuse authority, power, position, etc. to make as much dough as possible while keeping as much oil as possible flowing into the U.S.    Extraordinarily prescient, given the fact that the Middle East has passed their Peak Oil Production (including Saudia Arabia some time between 2002 and 2006), as we had done in the early 70's (around the time of the oil crisis) and Russia had in the 80's. The North Sea is also virtually used up. With China and India soon to overtake American consumers as the chief abusers of this quickly depleting natural resource, it is no wonder why we are witnessing the U.S. government taking over one of the largest oil producers in the world, and another big oil producer attempting to arm itself with nukes in order to prevent the U.S. from attempting to 'steal' or manipulate their oil situation. Without oil, modern American society would alter dramatically in a verynegative way and that is why some believe that it is necessary to do absolutely whatever it takes to grab our share of oil - even if it means the unlawful invasion of a sovereign nation.    And that is what Syriana shows - unscrupulous, corrupt sociopaths murdering and screwing everybody over for every last barrel they can get before it runs out.    I understand that many Americans *choose* to ignore or disbelieve that oil is indeed running out with all major oil fields having surpassed their peaks (which doesn't mean we are only halfway through it, as anywhere up to the last 10-25% of a given oil field is extremely poor quality not to mention more expensive to extract as could ever possibly be gained on the market).  It is a scary thought, and people *choose* to ignore facts. Ignorance is bliss, as they say. And these ignorant types, of course, won't like Syriana.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Chili Peppers deliver their best CD in what many thought was the twilight of their career. How good is Stadium Arcadium? It's a stunner because it serves the expected and unexpected in equal portions. The Peppers have never sounded so pop (that's a good thing). The original yet limited punk-funk act has flowered into perhaps the most diverse band in America. Couple that with musicianship that is second to none and you get a four-headed monster primed for chart domination. Anthony Kiedis singing (once a weakness) has never been better. Flea and Chad Smith are untouchable as rhythm making madmen. But the star of this inner-space journey is John Frusciante. His playing is reaching a level that almost has me using the H-word (Hendrix!). He is one of the few guitarists who can play with quiet beauty (Stadium Arcadium), crunching funk (Hump de bump) and hard rock power and grace (throughout both discs). It's a performance for the ages (rock, that is) and he will finally get the recognition he deserves. Flea said it best: If you don't like the new record then you don't like RHCP. It's all here: radio friendly peppers (Dani California), slow thoughtful peppers (Slow Cheetah) and bust a nut PEPPERS (Tell Me Baby, Readymade). Stadium Arcadium is their masterpiece; enjoy...
B000EULJLU|5.0|Well, Ive been listening for a week straight, and Im convinced this is the greatest piece of music released in the last 26 years. This belongs alongside Beethoven and Da Vinci as incredible art. The complexities, the power, the subtlety...I cant say enough about how good this album is. There is no highlight, no lowlight, the entire album flows as one. It takes a while to hear it as one long composition but once you do it becomes absolutely brilliant.  <br /> <br />Masterpiece is an understatement here.
0596007124|1.0|The Head First series is a colossal waste of time.  This series is like the \\"Complete Idiots Guide\\" or \\"For Dummies\\" guides but from O'Reilly.  The books are littered with cartoons and analogies that detract from the subject matter.  This series has a retching case of the cutes.<br /><br />A developer wants facts and usable information, not glyphs, jokes, puns, cartoons, and waste.  The O'Reilly series of books are famous for their to-the-point bare-bones factual content.  This style of book is like Marvel or DC comics trying to teach children technology.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, energy, or worse, your money on this series.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is a truly unique album. It's the only record they made, and it's the only one they needed to make. This is a totally 1970's hardrock album, but like nothing else that came out in that decade (even compared to the other punk albums of the time). What the likes of The Stooges, Alice Cooper, Ziggy Stardust-era David Bowie, and the New York Dolls started in the early-7O's, the Pistols picked up on and made trashier and nastier. If you're looking for pristine production value, great musicianship, and poppy sounding vocals then D0N'T BUY THIS ALBUM - it's Punk Rock after all!!! But that's not to propigate the myth that these guys had no musical talent. Guitarist Steve Jones knew how to bust out the power-chords and old fashion Chuck Berry riffs and solos. Yeah, that's not the most complicated stuff, but that doesn't matter, it sounded damn good! And singer Johnny Rotten was the perfect \\"angry youth\\" frontman. The annoying, pissed off voice mixed with the politically tinged, smarmy, sarcastic, and offensive lyrics is brilliant! The two most well known songs from the album, \\"Anarchy In The UK\\" and \\"God Save The Queen\\", aren't the best tracks here, and over the past 30 years have overshadowed the rest of the album - which is all great. There isn't a single bad song on Nevermind The Bollocks. \\"Bodies\\" (about a woman getting an abortion) is probably still one of the most offensive songs ever written. In \\"New York\\" Johnny Rotten takes on this 195O's-rock style crooning when he sings the chorus which is classic. And now, nearly 20 years after the fall of communism and the Berlin Wall, there's still something menancing and sinister about the jackboot marching intro to \\"Holiday In The Sun\\". The album was almost entirly the product of Steve Jones and Johnny Rotten. Yeah, Paul Cook played drums, but bassist Glen Matlock was gone by this point, and they wouldn't let Sid Vicious play bass because he sucked. And while Malcom McLaren may have been the overbearing, string-pulling manager, he had almost nothing to do with how this album ended up sounding (the story is that he thought it sounded horrible). Some of the material on Nevermind The Bollocks is dated (it came out in 1977 after all), but the Jones/Rotten/Cook touch makes it still very entertaining today. The mythology surrounding the bizzarre story of the Sex Pistols has given rise to a lot misinformation. This is very clear by the ton of wrong stuff in many of the reviews I've read here on Amazon, intersetingly enough mostly by the people who have only negative things to say about the Pistols. So seriously, actually listen to the album and get your facts straight before writing a review - and just because you're only 16 is no excuse!
1594200823|4.0|A well-written, informative, and at times disturbing book.  It's scary to contemplate how distanced we've become from our food sources, and the consequences this distance has for our planet, animal welfare, our own health, and our future.  I do quibble with some of his statements about vegetarianism, as does another reviewer above.  Perhaps Pollan was in a bit of a rush to return to his meat-eating ways.  Meat-eating may be our natural state, though our current habits of meat-eating are far from natural.  Pollan does a great deal more to illustrate this point than he does to detract from it by his potentially misinformed statements on the vegetarian and vegan causes.  Overall, I highly recommend this book.
B000002H97|2.0|I have never had real contempt for a rock album, but I have to say that I can't stand this CD. In the 8O's Metallica were the great American thrash-metal band. The first time I saw slamdancing/moshpit outside of a small club, and in an arena, was at a Metallica concert in 1989. There is N0 thrash or speed on this album. I'm all for groups musically progressing, but come on, this was Metallica! If they hadn't had 4 heavy albums in the 80's this probably would have been washed away with all the other metal that disapeared when the alterna-rock boom happened in the early 9O's. I had to give it 2 stars because \\"Enter Sandman\\" is a great song, and \\"Sad But True\\" isn't too bad, but the rest is B0RING. This is all pretty much mid-tempo metal, and the lyrics aren't anything catchy or inspiring. And what's up with \\"Don't Tread 0n Me\\"? The \\"Here We Go Patriotism!\\" lyrics are like something a redneck country singer would have written, not the longhaired, anti-establishment, rebelious Metallica?! So yeah, it was the begining of the end for these guys right here. I don't often cast \\"sellout\\" stones, but in 1991 Metallica deserved it and have kept deserving it since. Buy the first 4 Metallica albums from the 8O's and stop there.
B00000DHRX|4.0|If you're looking for the full version of Careless Whisper, it's not on this CD. The music companies could make it easy to know what version of a song is on CD's by listing the time of each track on the cover notes.
158234082X|5.0|Tony Bourdain is a smart, witty, funny, and deeply twisted individual, and is also a first-rate writer whose non-fiction is as entertaining and expressive as any novel I have ever read. I first became aware of Tony through his cable television show \\"No Reservations\\" (which is the only television show that I go out of my way to see each week.) I immediately bought this book after seeing the episode on Icelandic cuisine, as I thought he was intelligent yet not another insufferable food snob. He is a man who wants to try everything and has absolutely no fear or prejudices about food and excels at telling it like it is.<br /><br />This book recounts his life and career rising to the top of the pack in the culinary world. It is a deeply personal and unvarnished look at the world of big-league professional food, and is full of insights on both food and the restaurant business. When I was younger I worked as a line cook in a relatively nice restaurant. Although my experience was somewhat less frenetic and more sanitary than the scene in New York, I can certainly attest that the cast of characters (and their flaws) revealed in this book is right on the money.<br /><br />One thing I like about Bourdain and this book is that he tells the truth even when it's ugly. He explains why, for instance, not to order meat well done or why not to even think about ordering fish on Monday. (He's right on both accounts.) He doesn't dodge his own past when others would fail to mention diversionary activities such as a heroin addiction, and even though he comes across as cantankerous, he is a guy you can take at his word.<br /><br />Some of this book is pure gold, not just for cooks and would be chefs, but for everyone. His writing (\\"Rules to Live By,\\" page 64, and \\"A Commencement Address,\\" page 293 in particular) is excellent and applies to any profession. He also shares many inside secrets of Les Halles (and other restaurants he has worked at), of winning \\"mise-en-place\\" (or just \\"meez;\\" people who really want to cook professionally should take this to heart), and technical opinions (why and how to use an offset serrated knife.)<br /><br />This book is coarse and not for the faint of heart, but if you really want to know about cooking or cooks, it is the best (and funniest) single volume ever written. I highly recommend this bookeople who really want to cook professionally should take this to heart), and technical opinions (why and how to use an offset serrated knife.)<br /><br />This book is coarse and not for the faint of heart, but if you really want to know about cooking or cooks, it is the best (and funniest) single volume ever written.

B000EMGAOY|4.0|The Peppers rock their new album out... Haven't even gotten to the second silver circle yet, but I can tell it is going to be just as good as the first disc... or better.   I have listened to the half several times today, trying to give it attention it deserves now.  Most of today has been combined with driving.  Great driving music.  <br /> <br />So far, all the songs have a bit of funk, but are combined with that middle-aged thoughtfulness that has been found in the lyrics and groove of last couple albums.   Not anything bad, just older.  Wine is better with age.  So is wisdom.   <br /> <br />The album is well mixed, I hear everyone just fine, at all the right moments.  Rick Rubin does such a good job at this.   MOst of the song have tons of funk and settle into a compromisable well-absorbing groove.   Any of the songs serve as a good example.  Anthony is on top of it... lyrically and vocally.  Mr. Frucaiatne's guitar lines are all in fine form... anyway,  I love the album...  <br /> <br />Favorites right now are \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", \\"Slow Cheetah\\", \\"WEt Sand\\", and \\"Hey\\".... they are really all good though... <br /> <br />Can't wait to check out disc 2.... Can't wait for the live vibe that they are so good at.... <br /> <br />Peppers kind of lost me in the albums following Blood Sugar, but this brings them back for sure!   <br /> <br />I only give this album 4 stars because I only give the very very best albums 5 stars and I haven't listened to this one but maybe two or three times through, and only disc 1!!!  <br /> <br />rossg77
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting for a new TOOL album to come out.  Especially since the  music world thought that they might not get back together.  Well, the day has come.  All TOOL fans mus here this album.  It is melodicly enchanting and maynards words and voice just take me away and put me into a trance, just like the other albums.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I agree with most of the \\"listeners\\" out there that \\"get\\" this album. As with Lateralus,10,000 days requires repeated listening in a secluded space(a.e. listening to it with headphones on and without distractions). I must admit I did this new album a disservice the first time I listened to it. I invited a couple of friends over who are also huge Tool fans and we listened to it played on my \\"boombox\\". Needless to say we agreed that it was slightly dissapointing. BIG MISTAKE! So later that night I did what I did when I bought Lateralus. I put on the headphones,cranked it up and went on the surreal,metaphysical musical journey that this incredible band dared me and other fans to go on. I opened up my mind and my heart and went through the \\"gates\\" of transcension.Three times in a row(three+ hours) I listened and came to the conclusion that this is yet another masterpiece from what I consider the best band out there PERIOD! As much as I love progressive,intelligent bands such as System of a Down and The Mars Volta, they cannot touch the deep profoundness that Tool exhibit in each and every song they produce. It's spiritual,organic,profound, and a thousand other adjectives that wouldn't do it justice.I will admit,10,000 days will not be to everyone's likes and tastes. If,like me, you want to be entertained,enlightened, and challenged simultaneosly by a band that will ultimately earn a place as one of the all time great rock and roll bands to ever exist besides the likes of Pink Floyd,The Beatles,King Crimson,etc. then pick up this album a.s.a.p.You will not be dissapointed. Also being a drummer myself, I'll say that Danny Carey is \\"the\\" best rock drummer out there period. He could give Neil Peart and Bill Bruford a run for their money anyday of the week. He absolutely shreds. Maynard,Adam,and Justin are also on an elite level of musicianship and artistry that can't be touched by the majority of today's bands.Keep going strong Tool. You give all of us fellow musicians a high level of intelligence we should all aim for.If some of you out there want to listen to a band that always rocks out but never changes then go buy stuff from Godsmack or Korn. They are great bands, but they will never be on the same league as Tool. TOOL RULES!
B0006L16N8|4.0|This is the first Coldplay album I have totally listened to.  It was recommended to me by a fan and I fell in love with the flow of the entire album.  It is a mellow dream of lyrics and music.  I am a fan for life.
630522885X|3.0|Being unfamiliar with the criterion laserdisc print of this film, I can't really comment on the quality of this FOX LORBER edition. I can imagine that the colors could be a little more vibrant, as this edition did seem a little \\"washed out\\".  But since its the only print available right now on DVD (region 1 anyways), I find it satisfactory (otherwise I would give this film a rating of 5 stars).  For those nitwits that don't find the character played by the exquisite Martine Carol fleshed out enough...Pay closer attention.. if youre looking for history rather than fiction..ummm, go die.  This truly is one of the most remarkable films of all time. The subject matter, while set in the 19th century, is handled as (post?)modern as anything out right now. This is a story of a figure whose (vulgar?) exploits and scandals could only be tamed (at the hands of men and the status quo) by being reduced to a SPECTACLE (how true of ANY revolution!!!!!! ).    Buy the fox lorber print ...its cheap enough. theres so much to be gained by this film.  theres a haphazard review. hope it was helpful.    p.s. Martine Carol is gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004TH83|4.0|Sadly, so many others have never either. Why is that a problem? A few reasons: First, she's around the same age as Celine Dion...yet hasn't achieved nearly the same success yet. 35 years old is not old by hardly any standards...but usually divas are born in their late teens...early 20's. I know of few exceptions to this rule. They want them fresh out of the egg.<br /><br />Second, she likely won't achieve the measure of success of a Celine or Barbra, given her age and given that she's being strongly compared to Celine and is being called \\"The next Celine\\"...as if the world needs two Celines at the same time. Perhaps if Celine's days of success were over...<br /><br />Barbra was compared to Garland back in the early 60's, but remember, Garland was far past her prime and quickly heading downward, while Celine is still considered at the top of her game, youthful, vibrant and will likely follow up her past successes with many more to come. Will there be room for two vocalists who sing substantially the same, look similar, are the same age and who are both French Candadian? I can't imagine it.<br /><br />Third, it's been nearly 4 years since the release of this CD...and where are the follow ups? Celine was cranking out an album nearly ever year before Vegas...and Mariah had a number one hit for every year of the 90's. Has Lara already gone \\"bye bye\\" before even making a huge splash in the U.S.? Time will tell, I guess.<br /><br />Lara is a phenomenal singer...and, in a different world, she'd be the current Celine Dion. Unfortunately, she was born in the wrong decade for that.
0671027387|3.0|Dan Brown writes ok. No more, no less. To write a book on the topic of a possible child of christ Da Vinci Code was a smart plan and gave mr Brown much fame. But don't be mistaken. His books are by far no literature. Nice reads though! Deception Point has a nice storyline. Several parts of the book could be skipped and do not offer anything to the main plotline. The boat scene at the end of the book is written completely over the top. The only thing I missed was a giant Yeti coming from the water to rescue everybody ;-).<br /><br />Do I recommend this book?<br /><br />Yes, it's a nice read when you're on a holiday, in the train or airplane.<br /><br />No, not a very good example of interesting style, vocabulary a.s.o.
B0009X7664|5.0|<br />A Reflection Of Our Lives  <br /> <br />The following May 2006 review of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is an update to my prior January 2000 review of the same movie. This updated review refers to the superior \\"Legacy Series Edition\\" of the movie which is now the preferred DVD purchase choice. The \\"Legacy Series Edition\\" includes notably better sound options (Dolby Digital 5.1) than previous editions (such as the \\"Collectors Edition\\") as well as various `extras' now included in the \\"Legacy\\" two disc set. The `5.1 sound option' alone is worth upgrading to the \\"Legacy Series Edition\\" and many fans will appreciate the new `extras' included on the new version. Now, on to the movie (and the book)...  <br /> <br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a timeless classic, displayed in breathtaking imaginative and visual beauty whether you read the book or watch the movie. Either genre brings to life the old south, its charm, its bigotry, its prejudice, its fear of the unknown, and ultimately its triumph of the human soul.  <br /> <br />There is a beauty to both the movie and the book which seems to change as one grows older. The timelessness of the movie/book is evidenced on two different levels. Both are appreciated today as much as when they were originally released. Perhaps more importantly, children under the age of 10 identify with the book or movie as only a child can. As one grows older, you see the movie/book through the eyes of an adult and from a different perspective. A parent can also appreciate the movie, reliving it through their own children's eyes.  <br /> <br />The BOOK is essentially the 'coming of age' of Jem as he slowly leaves his childhood behind and begins to understand the harsh realities of life in the deep South. The MOVIE more represents the 'coming of age' of Scout as she views the black and white realities which slowly surround her. Scout's innocence reminds adults of their moral code and conduct in the movie, the book, and (surprisingly) in real life. She is able to center us on our own humanity as is witnessed in many scenes; chiefly in the (midnight) jail scene where she single handedly (and unknowingly) stops a lynching by simply saying `hello' to someone she recognizes in the lynch mob.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, I suppose, the movie represents our 'coming of age', as a child, as an adult, as individuals, and as a society. Each of us must decide whether we will take up the hangman's noose or drop the rope in favor of the child within.  <br /> <br />On a different level, Boo Radley represents all of these same fears, prejudices, and bigotry ingrained within America, North and South. Only when we finally meet Boo for the first time, do we recognize a human face, a protector, a neighbor, rather than the devil himself. Scout and Jem's journey is also our journey, one in which we all make. Some choose to see the fearful murderer who lives in the Radley house, while others choose to see the human being and ultimately reach out to say \\"Hey Boo...\\"  <br /> <br />In this black and white book, in this black and white movie, in this black and white world, there will always be a Bob or Mayella Ewell. Fortunately, there will also be a Boo, an Atticus, a Tom, a Jem, or a Scout. Hopefully they will be there for each of us when we \\"waked up in the morning...\\"  <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Rushed out to buy this new album. Being a long time Chili Peppers fan I was so anxious & excited due to all the hype <br />and it was right on! Great rock album, balanced w/mellowness as well as funkiness!!! Can't wait to listen to it more & more!
B000E41MS6|5.0|I ordered these DVDs from the UK last year and have watched the entire season (13 episodes) straight through 15+ times.  The writing, the acting, and the special effects are all top notch - equal to anything we're seeing here on SciFi (Batllestar Galactica, Stargate SG-1, etc).   <br /> <br />If you ever watched the old series - even if you didn't like it - this show is worth it.  It picks up where the original series and TV movie left off.  Christopher Eccleston (28 Days Later) plays the ninth Doctor and if anyone can be said to \\"chew up the scenery\\" it is him.  He has boundless energy and an infectious, if somewhat mischievous, smile. <br /> <br />The new companion is Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and she is not like any companion from the old series.  The closest comparison you could make would be to Sarah Jane Smith from the late seventies.  However, Rose has more depth and a more participatory role in the series.  No longer do the Doctor's companions simply stand there and scream. <br /> <br />Later stories introduce other, equally compelling, companions like Captain Jack Harkness.  With a few exceptions all of the characters in the series are fleshed out and have solid motivations.   <br /> <br />The stories are clever and some are downright gripping.  All of the old series mythos are there (Time Lords, Daleks, the TARDIS, the sonic screwdriver, etc).  There are also quite a few new twists and there are a couple of moments in the 13 epsiodes where long-time fans will feel their jaws drop.  I smiled uncontrollably through all of them the first time I saw them. <br /> <br />At the price Amazon is asking this is a steal (I paid twice as much to get them from the UK).  Highly recommended. <br /> <br />

B000002BBY|4.0|\\"What`s the Story Morning Glory\\" was the first Oasis album I heard. I remember finding songs like \\"Don`t Look Back in Anger\\" and \\"Some Might Say\\" remarkable and refreshingly different. The album is still my favourite album by the band; in fact some of their later albums seem rather longwinded to me, with only few really good songs.<br /><br />On this album some of the best Oasis songs are to be found. Besides the two songs already mentioned you find the great ballads \\"Champagne Supernova\\" and \\"Cast No Shadow\\".<br /><br />\\"She`s Electric\\" is an up-beat track, greatly inspired by the Beatles. \\"Wonderwall\\" has a great acoustic guitar-riff, but the song somehow does not seem to have aged as well as many of the other tracks.<br /><br />\\"Hello\\" and and the title track are fine rockers and live-favourites. All in all,  the most consistent Oasis album.  There are signs on their newest album, though, that more fine albums can be hoped in the future.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have been a RHCP fan since Californiacation, and I am well familiar with their older material.  After a few hours of listening, this album is clearly the Peppers' best album yet. <br /> <br />Why is it so great? Stadium Arcadium is probably the most diverse album they have already made. Some songs (\\"Tell Me Baby\\", \\"Charlie\\", \\"Hump De Bump\\") are EXTREMELY funky and some are very alternative and reminescent to their newer material (\\"Hey\\", \\"She Looks to Me\\").  To top it off, each musician has grown since By the Way; Anthony's vocals seem stronger, Flea got his groove back, and Chad is becoming more technical. The standout of the CD is, without a doubt, Frusciante; this album is an answer to critics of By the Way/Californiacation that said that Frusciante lost his touch.  Stadium Arcadium has, without a doubt, Frusciante's best riffs and solos. <br /> <br />JUPITER: <br />1. Dani California - 9.5/10 <br />2. Snow - 9/10 <br />3. Charlie - 10/10 <br />4.

0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has written what is possibly the best book of the year.  This is well deserving of the praise it has received since its issue.  _Team of Rivals_ is not a typical biography, nor is it a history of the Civil War era.  It is, instead, a study of how Abraham Lincoln brought together a diverse group of people who in many cases were personally opposed to each other and forged them into a team.  This book shows how Lincoln turned opponents into partners, disparagers into praisers, and potential enemies into allies.  Ms. Goodwin has a terrific writing style, and it took an effort to actually put the book down for the evening.  I was actually sorry the book ended because it was so enjoyable to read.  It is richly detailed with many items that are little known and brought together here for the first time.  Ms. Goodwin has decisively proved the Lincoln theme has not been exhausted.
B000EULJLU|5.0|first off, stop advising fans to give it a chance, or multiple listens, before making judgements-- who doesn't listen to a new tool albumn 10,000 times anyway?  they are doing exactly what they have always done: pouring over every creative impulse they have, disecting what they hear and pushing themselves (and us) into ever stranger and unexplored territories.  tool is more than music, more than a band, they are examples of what Collective energy can do when the creative forces are embraced.  stop analizing 10K Days for a week and just listen/read/feel what these guys have been working on for the past five years... is it really any less than we expected? <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Vicariously I live while the whole world dies <br />Much better you than I. <br />You all need it too, don't lie! <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|4.0|So far my favorite song is track 10. It delivers everything Tool stands for for me. Hypnotic layering ultimately reaching a plateau of some of the most hair raising rock. It's a technically sound cd (almost said album). The mix is incredible. It really does look like they were messing in Eddie Munster's basement as the trippy cover art indicates. They came out with something unparalleled by any other group in this genre.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Emmylou Harris and Mark Knopfler are simply fantastic!  I would give them one thousand stars if it were an option.  I have seen both of them in concert and this cd is audio candy if there has ever been audio candy!  Every cut on this cd will haunt you like chocolate ice cream in the freezer... <br /> <br />If you just \\"like\\" these two folks now-buy the cd to fall in love with them. I am an Emmylou Harris \\"junkie\\" and have all the songs by Dire Straits.  Buy the record and enjoy thses two masters-you will not be sorry.
B000EULJLU|3.0|The new album, 10,000 Days, is exactly what has become the new standard for a Tool album.  Flashes of pure brillance and energy in a few tracks, and a whole bunch of \\"noodling\\" and lost musical interludes.  I'm trying real hard to like it.  If you are a dedicated Tool fan, I guess you need this in your collection (like me) but what happened to the energy-filled CD's jam-packed full of rockin tracks like Opiate, Undertow, and Aenima?  In this fan's opinion, the past two Tool albums   have been highly-indulgent.
B000002HJR|5.0|being an avid fan of pantera from day one, i had read in early '95, i believe, an advertisement in some mag. about Phil Anselmo's new side band Down, was releasing an album/cd of heavy, Sab. like metal. i new at that point that is was going to be a good one. you know how you often can't wait for a new title to be released, then are a little disappointed when you buy it, and listen to it? well, let's just say the opposite happened here. i was literally blown away! this is surely one of the best releases of the '90's, and maybe one of the best heavy releases of the last 20 years. sludgy, riff laden, well engineered, you name it, it has it. having owned over 2,000 titles from the last 30 years or so, this ranks right up there with some of the best. check it out. i have turned more people on to this cd than probably any other, and none have been disappointed, or thought i over-hyped it's merits. read the reviews. see if i'm lyin' to ya, then buy it, and join the club. peace.
0876855575|5.0|Like most of his books this is loosely based on Bukowskis real life experiences. Ham on Rye covers Bukowskis childhood and early adulthood, ending around his second year of college. Even though he had a pretty terrible childhood if your to believe this book he finds a lot of humor in some very horrid situations. I found myself laughing out loud constantly while reading this, so this is not some depressing whine fest. Even though its sad at times its also a VERY funny book. One slightly annoying thing is, even though he paints himself as the ultimate loser in virtually every facet of life he does not seem to be able to resist the urge to paint himself as a tough guy straight out of a corny Hollywood movie. Never losing a fight in his teen years, crushing an ape like college football player during a pick up football game, and even telling the ridiculously unlikely story of beating up a professional boxer in a backyard boxing match, even though he had never trained, been an athlete or even had a pair of boxing gloves on in his life! But besides that slight annoyance this book is a truly great read.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have been listening to Tool since the early 90's and have truly enjoyed every CD they have released.  I was really anxious to hear 10,000 Days and picked it up as soon as I could.  I was not a bit disappointed. <br /> <br />Having since gone through and read a number of reviews saying this disc didn't make any strides forward or that it isn't as good as Aenima, I just had to tell my opinion. <br /> <br />I think alot of people have missed alot of the things that Tool have done on this album that makes it sound different than any other.  The complex song structures and time signatures are still there, but they have gone further with their sound.  As everyone by now knows, Adam used a talk-box on this album, which I think was a perfect addition to the guitar solo on \\"Jambi\\".  Also, Maynard has obviously tried to expand his vocal abilities (\\"The Pot\\") which, in my opinion, adds more character to the sound and really changes the song from what it might have been.  Additionally they have mixed the vocals to be more on the same level as the rest of the band so as to make the vocals almost an instrument themselves.  Lastly, I commend Maynard for \\"Wings For Marie\\" and \\"10,000 Days\\".  They are for the most part \\"softer\\" songs, but listening to the lyrics makes them both amazing pieces of art and a fitting tribute to his mother. <br /> <br />As is usual with Tool CD's, it takes a while to get the full effect and really appreciate what they have created.  But after just a couple listens, you really start to realize what a great album this is.  And to all those that have criticized them for not being heavy or anything like that, Tool doesn't make their music to please everyone.  They make their music because it is what they feel and enjoy (just read some interviews).  On a side note, I encourage any Tool fans to pick up the latest edition of Guitar World.  The interview with Adam will give you a good taste of what they are doing musically and what they wanted to accomplish onthis disc.  <br /> <br />I think Tool has once again created another wonderful piece of art (CD and artwork) and 10,000 Days was worth every penny.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This DVD is incredible... One thing that is troubling to me though is Petrucci's guitar on this, particularly on the last song \\"In the name of God\\" I can not even hear it.  Is this just my copy or was his guitar lower than everyone else on the stage?? (which is an outrage if it is true)
B000EMGAOY|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers invented the rap/metal genre a good decade before the term was coined, not that the band's music is simplistic as the sub-genre would suggest as the Peppers also include elements of funk and jazz among others. This could explain how the band has survived, releasing nine albums as other rap/rockers like Limp Bizkit and Korn have disappeared into virtual obscurity. And the Peppers add to their funky legacy with Stadium Arcadium. <br /> <br />But ever since John Frusciante rejoined the band, the Peppers have gone on a mellower path with their last albums, Californication and By the Way. And even though Rick Rubin, who was at the help of the break out album, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, is back, the band continues the softer terrain. Even the louder songs on the set never reach the bombast of Give it Away or other songs that go even further back in their catalog. Lyrically, Anthony Kiedis also shows growth from the guy who was the master of the single entendre fifteen years ago (although the jury's still out on how dirty She's Only 18 is, but Hump de Bump isn't as suggestive as you might think). Of course they had to grow up sometime because no one wants to see a dude on the wrong side of forty wearing nothing but a sock. Then again, I don't want to see that from a dude on the right side of forty. But anyways. <br /> <br />If there is a downside to Staduim Arcadium is that, like almost every double album, it is way too long clocking in at over two hours and twenty-eight tracks. Then again the album doesn't plunge into the pit falls that has brought down other recent double disks by not dividing the album into specific genres like party songs and slow jams so both disk sounds like two full length Pepper albums, and the two disks, Mars and Venus, have no intrinsic means to them. As expected with this many tracks, there are a few songs that quickly got old and I found my skipping songs like Snow (Oh Now) and So Much I after a few listenings. <br /> <br/>Other songs have a very distinct Peppers song so much that when I first heard Tell Me Baby I thought it was Don't Stop. There a few songs that utilizes a horn sections reminiscent to elder funker Parliament and much to the pleasure of Christopher Walken, Readymade has a killer cowbell part. But in the end, the set could have been scaled down to a single disk, although not getting rid of the up tempo songs, as there were too many mid tempo songs bogging down the two disks.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Easily one of the most thoughtful films of all time, made with such TLC and intimacy that the crew MUST have been looking at themselves during filming and said \\"do you realize what a masterpiece this is going to be?\\" It is the only film I have ever seen without a beginning or an end. Sounds outrageous, I know, but it's true! The film is train running in a circle, and we are simply dropped onto it in the middle of its run. Backreading quantum physics, time travel, and the nature of the universe before seeing this wont save you! Nothing can prepare you for this. At the end, you could have everything figured out in your head weeks after, and still not be satisfyed with your own explanation. Be prepared to think. Like jumping onto a moving train, it helps to have a running start.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|I've been a fan of Pearl Jam since the Ten days, so it's not like I never heard of them, OK! <br /> <br />This is their WORST album to date, uncatchy songs, weird guitar riffs and rhythms, vocals suck, weak meaningless solos, even the cover art is weak. <br /> <br />Here is their Albums List From Best To Worst. <br /> <br />VS <br />TEN <br />VITALOGY <br />YIELD <br />NO CODE <br />RIOT ACT <br />BINAURAL <br />THIS ALBUM
B000EULJLU|2.0|I am saying this cause Metallica's last album was an embarassment. I am a big Tool fan and I have to say this album is subpar,I love the lyrics and jamming power riffs from the past albums but it seems like alot of the tracks on this album are missing this. On alot of the tracks, it seems to me that the lyrics are drowned out by the instrumental.You might think that is good since we are talking about Tool, but the instrumental is weak. I swear some of the tracks would sound great in an elevator. The best song of this cd is Vicarious which sounds like a fill-in song on one of their past CD's. It is worth the price of a CD to get this but in the future it wont be a CD you will want to pull out and jam to like the previous masterpieces.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|:: WARNING THIS IS A LONG REVIEW::<br /><br />  I listened to the first Disc on Vh1 last night and I loved it.<br /><br />  I bought it today and listened to the first disc while I was out walking. Really awesome material here.<br /><br /> I have been a peppers fan for a long time,in my opinion Californication was a bit of a miss for me, while it had some great rockers,the funky songs kind of fell flat.<br /><br />  By The Way was kind of depressing to me while it has some really awesome songs it was another miss.<br /><br />  Stadium Arcadium is awesome!!! I love it.<br /><br />This is the 5th LP to feature,the current line up.<br /><br />  Mothers Milk<br /><br />  Blood Sugar Sex Magik<br /><br />  Californication<br /><br />  By The Way<br /><br />  and now Stadium Arcadium<br /><br />  My two favorites are BSSM and SA.<br /><br /> I don't think that either Mars or Jupiter top either, they are just one working entitie that progresses in a way it should.<br /><br />  Jupiter has most of the Funky Songs and Mars has the majority of the Rocking songs, both with a nice mix of Mellow songs.<br /><br />  The Mellow songs on here arn't a chore to listen to like they were on the past two albums, not saying that they wern't good on the past two albums,Porcelain, Warm Tape are some of my Favorite tracks, they are just kind of like I have to be in a certain mood to listen to them.<br /><br />  All the songs on this album have a very nice balance and amazing work from all it's players.<br /><br />  Oh and I am stoked that Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez did a guest spot :D.<br /><br />  Sorry for the legnthy review.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|A well balanced film of Lynch, who is prone to excess  sometimes though a brilliant director. This is a simple story about a man who goes to see his brother with a farm tractor.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|Everyone giving this album 5 star reviews seems to be obsessed with this band.  So far, I have listened to both discs of this double album and I am really not impressed, I am actually a little disappointed.  This is kind of bland in my opinion.  Most of these songs lacked any real punch for me.  It was like background music for whatever I was doing but nothing more.  I will have to give it a few more spins and see what it does for me.  I give three stars cause it is the Chili Peppers and I did hate Californication when it came out and ultimately ended up liking it so I am being a bit generous.  Plus, this is alot better than all the pop punk/emo garbage people are listening to nowadays. But to whoever said this album is better than Pink Floyd's Darkside of the Moon, you need to chill on that talk.  After about 15 years if this album is still on Billboards Top 200 albums list and this album has influenced hundreds of bands than maybe you have an argument.  But for now don't let your excitement of a new album get the best of you. One of the few songs that is good is Especially in Michigan, and that is in part because of Omar Rodriguez's guitar work.  Other than that nothing sticks out.  If you are an obsessed fan, go get this album but if you are just a casual fan of this band, I recommend getting Frusciante's solo work.  It is vastly different from RHCP but a little more rewarding than this album.
B000002B30|5.0|This is the Springsteen I know and love.  I don't like his folky music he does nowadays.  This is the classic Bruce and it's what he suits best. <br />Dancing In The Dark is one of the best songs in the universe.  I cannot stress that enough.  I could listen to it for days on end without boredom or frustration.  Other than that amazing song the other best are Born To Run and Streets Of Philadelphia (so hauntingly beautiful).  If there is a song I hate more than watching grass grow, it is Secret Garden. <br />This is a cd to get if you want to familiarize yourself with the classic Bruce.  I wish he could write more music like this instead of the folk music he's turned to lately.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is back in top form! Not much can be said about this album except it is unbelievable. You must experience it to understand it...It took me a while but then once it sunk in I was overwhelmed by how good this is! I love Jambi, 10,000 days and Rosetta Stone especially...8:36 on Rosetta Stone gives me shivers everytime.
B000F1IQMS|5.0|Excellent performances by actors and actresses.  It just another great historic production and a typical out-of-this-world Stephen Spielberg as director.  It kept me on my toes throughout the movie.  It would have been better through the planning of their activities, however, they are probably still top secret.  The Jews are definitely the elite of the world's Special Forces.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Great but where is Angel, Happy When I'm crying among some others left off here. I don't get it. They could have completed it, but they didn't. There was still time left on the cd to include these tracks.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|If you are a Red Hot Chili Pepper fan, there is no question you should buy this album. From gentle grooves, funky ass riffs, to hearing John Frusciante on a higer level, this is their finest hour. Stadium Arcadium is an instant classic with 18 songs that could be hit singles in a minute. I was nervous after By The Way and the fearsome foursome, Chad, Flea, John, and Anthony have proven the staying power of the Red Hot Chili Peppers! With out any hesitation buy this album!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I just started listening to this album and I can honestly say it is great. My friend didn't like the last album, but I think they keep getting better. This album is very solid at first listen which is impressive.
0385335482|5.0|This book (the entire series, really) is absolutely wonderful. I read it a couple of years ago now and have continued reading everything Ms. Kinsella publishes. It is so hysterical. You will laugh and cry, because you're laughing so hard! I love Becky. She's such a quark heroine and makes my shopping addiction look commonplace. At times you will also find yourself yelling at her though - literally. I found myself wanting to scream at the book, hoping Becky would realize what she is doing. She never will though. This book and its sequels are amazing. I highly recommend them to anyone who likes shopping, comedy and quirky yet lovable heroines. Enjoy!
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|This book reads as a thriller/mystery but has so much to say about life and death.  One of the best books I have ever read.  Beautifully written.  At times, very touching, funny.  As I was reading this book, I thought, what a talent this writer has.  Parts of it almost made me cry and I don't cry easily.  I couldn't put it down and was so disappointed when it ended.  I look forward to seeing more works from this author.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I can't compare this to other RHCP albums because it just came out yesterday and it hasn't set in yet. But I can however give you an idea of what it sounds like. <br /> This is the funkiest CD since BSSM, and their hardest rocking CD yet. It has more distorted rock then ever before, and more guitar solos then ever before.  <br /> <br /> Every intrument has steped its game up. Johns guitar solos, and flea has really come in hard, fast, and furious with the bass on all tracks. And Chad never intrudes with drums where its not necessary, like most other drummers, and he keeps the necessary rolls and fills throughout the album.  <br /> <br /> Theres no bad songs on here. Infact, almost every reviewer has listed a compleatly diffrent favorites list, and most of the 28 songs have made it on one list or another, so every song appeals to someone.  <br /> <br />Every song is different and they don't blend togeather at all. Each disc also has a different atmosphere to it. <br />This is the best album of the year so far, I recomend picking this up before anything else.
B000AGTPUU|1.0|Ok, the visuals were stunning, but other than that, this movie didn't fall, it plummeted! The characters were awful: A goody-two-shoes girl, a boy who is determined not to have fun, and a dumb boy who doesn't believe in Santa even if he is surrounded by elves. The movie is boring. The only exciting bits are motion simulators, and the bits that try to be funny just aren't. With all the computer animation these days, you'd think that they'd make a GOOD story to go along with the visuals.   It's all just chit chat about nothing, and two songs that are just flat out weird. I do not recommend this to anyone who hasn't read the book, because you won't want to read it after this movie.  The time of the movie is entirely taken up by a really boring and depressing train ride. It seemse like the creators wanted the movie to be long enough, so the filled it in with junky parts.  Santa was scowly, and seemed mean. The movie was flat out awful.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album redefined the Beatles and redefined rock music in general.  Everyone on the whole planet should own this album.  Everyone who I know who hates the Beatles loves this album.
B00005JOYA|5.0|Silent Hill is a movie about a young girl named sharon who repeatedly sleepwalks while having horrible nightmares. Her mother Rose has heard the mentioning of a town called Silent Hill and she wonders if taking her daughter there will help cure the nightmares. Apon entering the city, Rose losses Sharon and is on a hunt to find her, when she soon realizes that this town is nothing she ever thought it would be. During the daylight hours, the town is empty with nothing but a faint drizzle of ash falling. But as night falls, the demonic horror shows its face and shows the grasp it has on the town. Now Rose is on a race of time to survive long enough to find her daughter and leave this town for ever. The only problem is, she has very small clues on where Sharon is. Will the 2 ever make it out alive or will they too become held down by the evils grip for ever? Any person who played the original SH game, then they can understand that this movie fits pretty well with the game. Not completely but its enough to know where the makers are coming from.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|When I first reviewed Pearl Jam I was caught up in the excitement of the band, in my opinion, releasing their first great record since Yield. Over the last month of consistent listening to the album, I feel this has the chance to be something special in the Pearl Jam catalogue.<br /><br />The beauty of Pearl Jam is how each song demands your attention in much the same way Ten does. Peal Jam has a complete 1 to 13 feel to it that as the weeks have passed has a way of demanding continued spins on the stereo.<br /><br />The reason I beleive is that while the music is at first energetic and accessible, the songs have a meaty undercurrent provided by Eddie Vedder's spot on lyrics. Unemployable is a great example of this, at first I was grabbed by its bouncy feel and pop sensibility, but the tale of middle class worker being bounced from his job has a way of changing your original impresion as what first feels like a light pop hit is actually a Sprinsteen like tale of middle class frustration.<br /><br />The same goes for the opening string of hard rockers that blasts the record off, at first the sheer energy of the guitar playing grabs your eardrums, but at the core of each tune are some very descriptive lyrics that alter your original impression of the tunes. What at first seem like simply uptempo rock n roll are actually spot on rants describing some disturbing tales based in our modern culture. Severed Hand in particular has grown in terms of my fondness as the story of a woman appearing to hear of the death of her husband grows more rivetting with each listen.<br /><br />In time I beleive this album has the chance to stand up as one of the band's best ever.
B000002P72|5.0|Absolutely one of the finest live albums of all times.  I bought this album because it was listed as one of the top 100 guitar albums of all time in Guitar Player Magazine.  You get lightning in a bottle here with BB King at the height of his powers.  The audience is alive and you can feel the young woman hyperventilating and swooning to BB King's rendition of some blues classics.  His voice is flawless, still velvety smooth, especially when compared with later live albums by BB King.  There is the perfect mixture of BB King's introductions or setups for each tune, guitar, vocals and audience reaction.  The sound is immaculate, balanced and clear. His guitar playing is efficient and his timing is perfect.  It makes you wonder why more recent \\"live albums\\" lack the spontaneity and quality found in this recording.  The only regret is the album is not longer.
B000000XB9|5.0|This band have a song library to match anyone out with the exception of the Beatles.  This includes the Stones, the Who, Zepplin and Queen.  The others may command larger crowd and more airplay on the \\"we play anything\\" radio stations. These songs stand the test of time.  \\"I heard it thru the grapewine\\", \\"Who will stop the rain\\" and \\"Bad Moon Raising\\" and countless others are as good now as when they were first records and rank up there with the all time best rock songs of all time. <br /> <br />This collection is the more complete of any of the CCR's GH.    If you are not going to buy the complete set of orginals, this should be the one you own.  Even if you own all the rest, this is still the one to put on and hear them from the beginning to the end of their life.
1594481784|5.0|Read the book because it is insightful regarding relationships from the male perspective,because it gives a glimpse into the mind of a fanatic collector(music or other), or because it's doggone entertaining. But read the damn book. The protagonist decides to examine his life after, as is often the case, a painful episode in his life. Normally this type of book is a turn off to most men, but this book is so funny, and so dead on accurate that you don't mind taking the trip through Rob's(the protagonist) psyche.<br /><br />The humor comes in many forms. Rob's co-workers provide some hefty laughs with their top 5 lists, sarcasm and realistic portrayal of music geeks. Rob himself supplies many laffs with his self effacement and irony. And the turns the story takes itself are sometimes hilarious, sometimes just strange.( Wait til you find out what happens at the funeral of Rob's ex's father)<br /><br />The poignancy and depth of the book sneaks up on ya. One minute your chuckling over Rob's frustration with fans of Phil Collins, the next your sharing in a truthful,sometimes almost brutally so, insight into his mind.<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is that any book that can take a self -obsessed guy's ruminating on music,relationships and life in general, and keep me interested because of the humor and truthfulness of the inner and outer dialogues, is a damn fine book. Try it. It makes soul searching fun!!!
0060234814|5.0|The book, \\"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,\\" is the second book in the legendary series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia.\\" There are seven books at all, all written by C.S. Lewis. This book was published only five years after the end of World War II. The author dedicates this book to Lucy, a girl, that like the characters in the story, went to live in a country house, escaping from London in the war years. <br />   The author begin telling the story of four siblings, the Pevensyes. Peter, the oldest, Susan, the second oldest, Edmund, the second youngest, and Lucy, the youngest were all sent to a country house to live with professor Kirke, during the war.  <br />   They went to live in a humongous old mansion, where only an old professor and his maid, Mrs. Macready. One day, they were playing hide and seek, when Lucy, the youngest, found a spare room, empty like many other rooms in the house. The only difference was that this was not a completely empty room, but there was a wardrobe in it, and as soon as she entered the room, she was astonished with the wardrobe, there was something different about it. It was an old wardrobe with many drawings on it, and she thought it was a very beautiful wardrobe. They were still playing hide and seek, so, she hid inside the wardrobe, and she kept on going further in, until she thought to herself, \\"this must be a simply enormous wardrobe!\\" She had been walking through coats which didnt let her see what was in front of her, but she felt something cold under her feet, and wet. Soon, there were no more coats, instead, there were branches of  trees on her face. She was shocked when she saw that she was in the middle of a wood and it was winter. She had entered the world of Narnia, and there she had incredible adventures and she even met Mr. Tumnus, a faun.  <br />   When she came back to Earth, what seemed to heve lasted many hours in Narnia, didnt take any time at all, here on Earth. She tried to explain to them what hapened but theydidnt believe her. <br />   It was many days later that they were playing hide and seek again, and they all went in the wardrobe to hide and they saw that she was telling the truth. And That's how the whole adenture begins. <br />   All four of them were in Narnia this time, and they had to try to rescue their brother Edmund from the White Witch, the responsible for the eternal winter in Narnia.  <br />   Meanwhile, they met Aslan, the creator, the real king of Narnia, who helped them rescue their brother, and made them kings and queens of Narnia after they Fought the White Whitch, killed her and put an end to the long winter, bringing peace to Narnia again.  <br />   They were Kings and Queens for many years, until one day when they were walking through the woods and, accidentally, went in the wardrobe and came back to Earth. Like I said, it doesnt matter how much time you spend in Narnia, it doesnt take any time here, so after many years there, they came back at the same exactly time that they went in, and they became kids again. <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Alone by Edgar Allan Poe (1830) <br /> <br />    From childhood's hour I have not been <br />    As others were; I have not seen <br />    As others saw; I could not bring <br />    My passions from a common spring. <br />    From the same source I have not taken <br />    My sorrow; I could not awaken <br />    My heart to joy at the same tone; <br />    And all I loved, I loved alone. <br />    Then- in my childhood, in the dawn <br />    Of a most stormy life- was drawn <br />    From every depth of good and ill <br />    The mystery which binds me still: <br />    From the torrent, or the fountain, <br />    From the red cliff of the mountain, <br />    From the sun that round me rolled <br />    In its autumn tint of gold, <br />    From the lightning in the sky <br />    As it passed me flying by, <br />    From the thunder and the storm, <br />    And the cloud that took the form <br />    (When the rest of Heaven was blue) <br />    Of a demon in my view.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|I really enjoyed the direction in this movie.  The opening scene recalls that of Fight Club, but it is much more poignant.  The scenes move quickly and stand on their own, and though many of the sequences are contrived and are hyperbolic, they ring true because This story is based on true events.  The lead character was a real man and these things go down.  Don't get me wrong, I'm no liberal.  In the Clinton administration, the US was still the largest supplier of weapons in the world.  I digress to the bottomline: you'll enjoy this movie GUARANTEED.  (you have to have enjoyed a bloody movie like Fight Club though)
0974153001|5.0|This is the book I have waited years to find. Beautiful step by step photos. I can't wait to get started.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is music that challenges the senses, common thought processes, and anything generally perceived as 'normal'...What i like about Lateralus and now this cd is that it is an experience..Preconceived notions about what music should sound like must be thrown out the window, to even have a glimpse of understanding this kind of art...it is music to be appreciated..Personally i love it, it has a life of its own. Outstanding tempo changes, subtle textures, and incredible chemistry between the band members highlight this album..You can't compare this kind of music to any other, including Lateralus..because like Lateralus it takes TIME.  Time tells everything, and this is music that grows on you, or at least on me.  I give it 5 stars because it is BOLD, challenging, intelligent art.  Its not for everybody.  This is the first review I've ever written and i felt compelled to, because it was irritating reading other peoples comments on this cd, because its not what they 'expected'..I feel you can't expect anything from a band like TOOL, you just open your mind and listen.  This is real music from real geniuses, pure art.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Holocaust is personal for me so I don't pick usualy movies with this topic--too close to home. But this movie came highly recommended. It is funny! It is beautiful. I love how it twists and turns. Touring guide grandfather who until now refuses to see,and worked hard to forget his past--so hard he tried to incorporate himself to society that we see him first as a regular Anti-semite. When collector from America shows up to dig his family history, grandfather's eyesite and past returns. I enjoyed portrayal of Ukraine--time setting appeared to me as early post communist enthusiasm for everything American. We see spresent Ukraine through eyes of grandson who travels with grandfather and does everything to emulate what to him seems to be American -- it is caricature perspective, since he really does not know what Americans are like . I thought couple of times during movie that some jokes will be lost to those who did not have \\"fortune\\" to live under communism. Probably American casual viewer will miss some hilarity.  For lovers of great film this is going to be a treat.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|All thoughs people saying this album is rubbish, are stupid people who would not like it even if it had every song a hit. <br />There just thoughs type of people who hate every new album. <br /> <br />First of the album is \\"Dani California\\", (should be number 1) - 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Snow a excellant song first i didn't like it now i love it. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />3. Charlie one of my favourites. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />4. Stadium Arcadium not as good as i thought it would be as it is the name of the album, but still good. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />5. Hump De Bump my all time favourite Chili song. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />6. She's Only 18, even though i have listened to it alot, i still can't remember the song beat and lyrics. <br />5/10 <br /> <br />7. Slow Cheetah sounds like it could of come of By The Way. <br /> <br />8. Torture Me good song good be a hit. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />9. Strip My Mind i love this song. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />10. Espially In Michigan, i find this song rather boring really. <br />4/10 <br /> <br />11. Warlocks, probably just a adder to the album. <br />6/10 <br /> <br />12. C'mon Girl, can't really remember this song, so i must not be brilliant. <br />5/10 <br /> <br />13. Wet Sand, this is one of my favourites. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />14. Hey i quite like this one, ive got a feeling it is just a filler though. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />1. Desecration Smile, this is a great song, good beat, good lyrics, always make a great song. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />2. Tell Me Baby, was one of the singles, a very good song and i just love it. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />3. Hard To Concentrate, dont really likw this song, it never really gets going, but did have potiental. <br />6/10 <br /> <br />4. 21st Century, love the chorus, this song could come quite famous. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />5. She Looks To Me, quite a boring acoustic song, the lyrics are good though. <br />6/10 <br /> <br />6. Readymade, a excellant guitar solo, and flea's bass is beter than ever. <br />10.10 <br /> <br />7. If, i actaully really like this song. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />8. Make You Feel Better, one of the best on the album. <br />10.10 <br /> <br />9. Animal Bar, know idea what it is about, but the beat is good. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />10. So Much I, not the best. <br />4/10 <br /> <br />11. Storm In A Teacup, amazingly good funky beat, better than most songs on BSSM. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />12. We Believe, love this song, when the choir starts, thats when the song really gets going. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />13. Turn It Again, amazing again, not a bad momment. <br />10.10 <br /> <br />14. Death Of A Martian, a very unusaul chili's song. But is very good, probably good enough for greatest hits! <br />10.10 <br /> <br />Altogether, this album rocks! and is better than Californacation, By The Way. But not quite as good as BSSM, i may change my mind though!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Oh yeah, this is how a double album should be done. 28 songs, 2 cds, with at least 20 good enough to be singles from this double disc surprise we get from RHCP. For those who think the album sucks from just listening to Dani California alone, f*ck you and hear what the rest of the album has to offer.  <br /> <br />Its surprisingly good with a great flow, having funky rhythms of old-skool RHCP, mellower reflections and hard-rocking tunes. In short, its a summation of the styles RHCP used before, and , dammit, believe me when I say, this is good, no, GREAT stuff here! Chad Smith is tight as ever on the drum kit, playing more jazzy and funky fills, Flea with his finger popping bass lines, Anthony shows both his mellow and funky vocals here.  <br /> <br />But the real star of the show is John Frusciante, making up all those years of heroin loss with this. Awesome solos back to back with each song! A lot of people say this, but John Frusciante may well be the Jimi Hendrix of our time. He's got the skills to back it up! Funky, electric, soulful guitar licks that leave you knocked in this wild psychedelic ride! <br /> <br />So attention to the Foo Fighters, Springsteen, Nelly and Guns and Roses, this is how a double album should be done! It actually keeps listeners entertained all throughout and never bores them! Standout tracks include: Readymade, Snow( Hey OH), Dani California, etc. <br /> <br />OH YEAH, it goes to show that the Chili Peppers can still pull off some great tricks up their sleeves!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Jesus tap-dancing Christ I am in complete shock and awe when it comes to Stadium Arcadium.  This is absolutely rediculous.... to have four people come together to create these 28 hits is unheard of. Both albums are amazing all the way through. Each song is perfect in its own right. Anyone calling \\"Hey\\" (track 14 on Jupiter) filler, is absolutely out of their mind. This is the greatest makeout song ever written! Plus, John's solo at the end has the most pure heart and soul that I have heard come from a guitar in a VERY long time.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|Let's get one thing clear right off the bat: I really, really, really enjoy Lasse Hallstrom's films. The Cider House Rules, The Shipping News (one of my all time favorites), Chocolat, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape are a few that stand out. So I went into this movie expecting the typical Lasse-style film ...and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />For those looking for a historically accurate recounting of Casanova's life, you best look elsewhere; this movie only touches on a few aspects of the great lover. Here we get a fun, raucous comedy with cinematic character (all filmed on location in Venice) along with sumptuous sets and startling costumes.<br /><br />Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain, 2005) plays the starring role and does so with a wit and charm reserved for such a part. Indeed, I'm becoming more and more impressed with Mr. Ledger. His ability to play a confused gay cowboy in one film, then a slight historical figure in the next speaks well for his future acting career.<br /><br />The story...<br /><br />Casanova's life is in jeopardy. The Prince of Venice has been covering for Casanova's immoral behavior (fornicating and adulterating) but the Catholic Church has had enough. Inquisitor Pucci (played perfectly by the baritone-voiced Jeremy Irons) has come to Venice to hang the famed lover of women. But confusion reigns as Casanova misdirects the Inquisitor by taking on the (phony) mantle of Paprizzio, a famed pork lard salesman. Oliver Platt (again, perfectly cast) nearly steals the show as the real - and rotund -Paprizzio who comes to Venice to marry the beautiful Francesca Bruni (Sienna Miller). Casanova falls in love with Francesca while Paprizzio falls for another. But Casanova is promised to another \\"virgin\\" whom he must marry in order to save his neck. Can he go against his womanizing behavior and get married? Is his affection for Francesca just another set of desires? Or could it be true love?<br /><br />Against all of this slapstick behavior is the beautiful backdrop of Venice. Its amazing streets, waterways, ancient buildings with staggeringly beautiful edifices, and, of course, the usual Lasse Hallstrom direction of all of it; this is what Mr. Hallstrom loves more than anything else: letting the settings become a character themselves.<br /><br />This isn't to say the movie is perfect. It isn't. The script, although holding its own charm, was fairly shallow and predictable. For instance, when Paprizzio is rebuffed by Francesca, his future wife, everyone knows that Paprizzio will find another mate close by.<br /><br />But even so, the film is packed full of great dialogue, great sets, even better costumes, and some wonderful actors (How could you possibly dislike a film with Oliver Platt, Jeremy Irons, Lena Olin, and Heath Ledger in it?) History buffs should avoid the film like the plague, but if you like slight comedies and, in particular, have enjoyed the Lasse Hallstrom films listed above, you'll delight in this flick.

B000EULJLU|4.0|I've been listening to this CD quite a bit over the last week and I think it rocks. It is what you would expect from Tool and I am satisfied with new material, period.  When you're starving for product and you like the band what's not to like? I wouldn't say it's the greatest CD ever or crap like that, but I like what I like and that's good enough for me. No need to get all analytical about it or post a Tool dissertation to showcase my scary intellect. To all the genius OGT hookers with penises out there who are \\"dissappointed\\" (sic) with this record I say, go find another band that you can brag about to your friends that you \\"discovered\\" and quit whining.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is the first music I've bought in about five years, a direct result of hearing them perform live on Imus a few weeks ago. The blend of these two voices, the guitar layering, the neat chord changes, and the lyrics are all really something to behold. \\"If This Is Goodbye\\" is one of the most exquisite recordings I've ever heard. With each listening, I feel like it further imprints itself in some kind of personal, all-time place of honor.
B000EULJLU|2.0|The first Tool album I ever listened to was Lateralus.  I liked it.  It was like walking outside one day to see a massive rhinocerobot, ten stories tall charging towards you.  As it passes over you, it's lack of stomach and breast plate.  You look into gears, lights, electrical snakes coiling around cast-iron angels.  Air rush from r(hin)obot lifts you into the air, into r(hin)obot.  Lights, colors, shapes, spiral, machine elves, feathered serpent, marble statue of empty space, stars.  Then you descend.  You look back at the r(hin)obot as passes and leaves, and think, \\"I'm gonna miss that r(hin)obot.\\" <br /> <br />Then listened to Undertow.  It was like walking outside and beeing covered by a massive wave of sludgy swampwater.  Constant movement and shapes shift, distort.  Is that an alligator or flying tree?   <br /> <br />Then I listened to Aenima.  Probably my favorite.  Imagine a tornado engulfs you.  You look around.  Where has this tornado been?  I see a . . .  Ferris Wheel.  Clown Head.  Lights.  Giant Wooden Fish.  Metal Apple.  It goes on for too long.  But there's no regret when it's over. <br /> <br />Opiate?  It's riding a zombie dragon, and blowing **** the **** up. <br /> <br />This?  Imagine all those cool experiences are supplied by Tool.  Then you're friend says, \\"Yo, dude.  Tool makes a new experience.  It will done soon.  Go to Best Buy wit me to pick it up?\\"  You say, \\"Of course.\\"  You go to Best Buy the first day the new experience is available.  You see a giant ice pyramid with a dead monkey on top.  At first you're expecting something cool to happen like always, but nothing.  Then, you're like, \\"Maybe it's just denser.  Maybe It'll make sense if wait a little longer.  Maybe if I look at hippy-b*tch paintings through b*tch-hippy glasses It'll make sense.\\"  But no.  Then you're like, \\"WTF?  Ice Monkey?  This isn't art.  This is ar-suck.  I hate this.  I'm dissappointed.  On a (dissapointment) scale of one to ten (with ten most disappointed), I'dgive myself an eleven. <br /> <br />Then the next day, once the expectations go away you look at the ice pyramid again and notice that once it melts there are some old Atari video game controllers shaped like brass knuckles, and the plastic monkey is wearing a PETA t-shirt.  And you're like, \\"That's interesting and slightly entertaining. <br /> <br />Jambi: Heavy, interesting.  Military music.  Trippy music.  Both. <br />Title Track: Pulsates.  Grows.  Rises and falls.  Flows.  <br />Others: Big melty ice (not a) pyramid (any longer) of suck.
078681859X|5.0|Many of the fantasy books that come out sound pretty much the same, even more so now since the booming popularity of the Harry Potter series which are excellent in my opinion.  They are filled with young majicians who have to save the world from corrupt adult majician who only care about power and money.  The amulet of Samarkand is repetitive when it comes to the main plot of the story but it's written in a way that's different than any of the books I've read, and in this case change is good.  The book flipflops from Nathinial who is the young wizard who has to save London, and Bartimaeus, a 5000 year old djini he has summoned.  Nathanials chapters are in third person and Bartimaeus' chapters are in first person, not to mention the very comical footnotes from Bartimaeus clarifying himself and giving you background info on other demons and such.  I am not one to laugh while I am reading, even if I find something funny but I gave a chuckle or two while reading this one.  I'm not going to go into the story, you can read all about that in other reviews, I will say that I finished this book in about a week which for me is fast b/c I don't read every day.  People who pick this book up thinking it's going to be the next Harry Potter will be disappointed, this book isn't Harry Potter and the author isn't J.K. Rowling.  It's the Amulet of Samarkand by Jonathan Stroud, I think people who pan the book forget that.  It's an excellent book and I have bought book 2 \\"The Golem's Eye\\" and can't wait for it to get here so I can start reading it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|You have got to be one self obsessive egomaniacal close-minded dead brain to have even an ounce of criticism for this album or any TOOL album for that matter. This band is the epitome of artistic musical perfection(or inperfection what ever art means to you) & \\"10,000 days\\" is just another example of there above & beyond the rest greatness & if you disagree with me than your a critic not a music fan. With that said if you love music & if you love TOOL then this album & the brilliant package it come's in is an absolute no-brainer! If you have anything negative to say about this album then your 'eyeballs deep in muddy waters' & your nothing but a TOOL!
6305181772|4.0|I often wish that Hollywood would make more movies that require an IQ above the third grade.  The success of this movie, and many like it, exactly proves this point.  There were parts that got a little bit confusing, but for the most part it was easy enough to follow. <br /> <br />The action in this movie is pretty awesome.  This movie, despite the \\"smartness\\", remains an action movie first and foremost.  So any action buff should be checking this movie out without a doubt.
B00000099Y|5.0|I would like to pry open my third eye(think for myself) & write my own review about this Brilliant album that eptomizes great art/music but instead I'm just going to agree with SAMHOT'S review 100% and advise you to take the time to read it because i couldn't say it any better than that so READ HIS or HER REVIEW & forget mine!
B000EQ5TSI|3.0|The first movie was pretty good.  The second movie is a decent followup with more explosives, more action, and more stunts.  The only thing is that it slowed down on plot, story, and its appeal towards a mental capacity above the third grade. <br /> <br />A lot of people really appreciated how \\"smart\\" the first movie was.  Some people complained about it being a bit confusing so for the second movie they dumbed it down.  Did it work?  Well, it is hard to tell.  First of all, the second installment did make more money but won less critical and audience acclaim.  Personally, I prefer the first movie over the second. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint was that they tended to do the face-switching game way too much.  Every other person wasn't who he claimed to be.  In the end, they just used it as a copout whenever they couldn't further their plot without something original.
B00006JU7T|4.0|I read Serpico's bio after seeing the movie and fell that the movie stayed very true to the book.  I knocked down a star since Serpico's love life isn't done that well.  We have a scene where the police corruption is eating up at him so badly that he can't have a relationship.  I thought that the scenes with his first girlfriend were pointless and didn't add to the character development much.  The heart of the movie is Serpico's fight to be a different type of cop.  Then he must fight the system to expose corruption.  It's also great to see Pacino's work before he tried to be too hammy.  He can convey a lot of emotions in one look and doesn't have to resort to yelling a la Scent of a Woman/And Justice for All.
1400079179|2.0|The book was written to be turned into a movie and make the author a gizzilionaire.  Did I have fun reading it? YES.  It is fast paced, pseudo smart if you want to read something dumb and quite entertaining.  Do I believe everything it says? No, definitely not all of it;  it does put forward over due plausible arguments and hypotheses.  But there are better authorities and more intelligent discussions.  Do I recommend it?  If you like to be entertained, definitely.  It is like Eye of the needle, but it upsets the religious right!  :-)
B000EULJLU|5.0|I don't understand why some people are giving this album so much criticism. 10,000 Days is a great album, from Vicarious to Right In Two I enjoyed every minute of it. I will agree that the last track, Viginti Tres, probably shouldn't be considered a \\"song\\" in the traditional sense, but instead of looking at it and saying \\"I don't like that. It's not even a song! why would they do that?\\" look at it as a song from a band who are doing their own thing and being creative. Creativity is something that is seriously lacking in today's music scene with all the cookie cutter generic bands that are cutting records left and right. 10,000 Days has some of Tool's best work in it, the guitar work is astonishing and the skull punching drums are something to be admired. 10,000 Days is easily one of my favorite albums to have ever been released.
044024157X|4.0|The Last Juror by John Grisham is not his typical legal thriller, but is more a coming of age story of a young reporter, Willie Traynor and the southern town he comes to call his home. He comes to Clanton as a college dropout, working as a cub reporter on the town's small newspaper. Within a couple of months, the owner of the newspaper has died and Willie, through a helpful investment from a rich relative, finds himself the owner, publisher and editor of the paper. Soon after he assumes ownership, the town is rocked by the brutal rape and murder of a young widow, Rhoda Kaselaw. In her dying words, she accuses Danny Padgett, a member of a powerful family that has been notorious for years for engaging in crimes ranging from drug dealing, to smuggling, to running moonshine back in the days of Prohibition. Despite the implicit knowledge of the family's criminal activities, no member of the family had ever been arrested until Danny Padgett was arrested for Rhoda Kaselaw's murder. <br /> <br />At the surface, this novel is about the trial of Danny Padgett, who is convicted and sentenced to life in prison, and then released after nine years. After his release, a series of murders occurs among the members of the jury that convicted him. <br /> <br />All of this is, however, merely the dressing for the real story, which is the growth of Willie from a naive, liberal kid who plans to sell the paper as soon as it starts showing a profit, into a well-respected member of the community. The book also traces his friendship with Miss Callie Ruffin, the first black woman to register to vote in Ford County and, with the trial of Danny Padgett, the first black woman to be seated on a jury. <br /> <br />It also details the growth of the town of Clanton from a pre-Civil Rights era southern town to a modern town that has faced its racist past. <br /> <br />This is a lovely book, at times humorous and at times sad, sometimes even occasionally scary, but more than anything, it is a life story. Those readers who pick it up hoping to find the thrill and suspense of Grisham's early novels will be disappointed by the gentile descriptions of luncheons with Miss Callie. But those who are interested in a rich story will find that as the book develops, they not only fall in love with Miss Callie, but they develop a deep respect and admiration for Willie Traynor, as he transforms from a callow youth into a responsible and prestigious adult. <br />
B00006DEF9|5.0|For most film critics  this is the top-of- the- top  movie musical. It  has a number of truly outstanding numbers, Donald O'Connor's 'Make em Laugh'is one. But the piece-de-resistance is of course Gene Kelly's most incredible 'Singing in the Rain' number.<br /><br />This particular piece when he dances with his umbrella under the rain is  filled with carefree joy, with simple sheer utter happiness. From time to time it simply ' breaks out inside me' when I am walking, whether in the rain or not. It is a case of Art enhancing Life of something you have seen on the screen not simply dying the minute you cease to look at it but resounding through the rest of your life.<br /><br />It just 'makes us happy again.'
1400079179|4.0|A few weeks ago, I spent all weekend read this book and was not disappointed. As a Christian, I am not offended with the story line. It is fiction after all but the facts of the story are fascinating. I thought it was well written.
B00007FCTH|2.0|This is by critical consensus one of the great movies of all time. In many polls it is taken to be the greatest film of all time.<br /><br />My sense is that this is critical opinion only, and that few ordinary moviewatchers like myself would think it even close to the top.<br /><br />I must admit I have seen once, or maybe one- and- one half times only.<br /><br />The whole mystery around Kane's last utterance 'Rosebud' and the subsequent search by flashbacks to discover 'who he really was' did not grip. I suppose this is because the type of Citizen Kane, the Hearst-modeled tycoon is not a type which holds any real interest for me. The aura of great wealth and power in business is simply something which leaves me cold.<br /><br />So if the major character is not appealing or of greatest interest, then what can be so 'great' in 'Citizen Kane'?<br /><br />Here I think there are answers which I as a layperson simply do not get. The introduction of 'deep focus photography'is one such element surely.<br /><br />In any case this is a movie I did not particularly enjoy watching. But I do not here propose my own reactions as standard of judgment for anyone else.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I Love this CD. It's absolutely amazing.<br /><br />To start, I'm afraid I have to say that Panic! At The Disco is a bit like Fall Out Boy. But only  a little. Pete Wentz would hardly use as many cusses as this group, and never starts off a song with \\"the poor groomsbride is a whore\\". Both are equally talented groups.<br /><br />I Constantly thank God for Esteban, I Write Sins Not Tragedies, Intermission, Camisado, and Lying is the Most Fun..are my favorites on the CD. This is a very talented group we're dealing with. Very original,and the lyrics can be thought provoking.<br /><br />I love this group. Panic! at the Disco is one of my all time favorites.
B00004ZD69|5.0|So its the day before Christmas and my best friend gave me this album.  Not as a Christmas present though, that part was merely a coincidence.  We have practically the same ears so my faith was clenched when he said go home put on the headphones, cut off the lights and light a candle.  So the following night I struck a match and found God. Say no more.      Disclaimer:  If you are listening to this music without headphones you are missing everything
0743455967|5.0|The story of how Stevie King gradually became best-selling horror writer, Stephen King, is fascinating for anyone - whether a writer or reader. If you've ever asked, been asked, or wanted to ask a writer how they do it, where they get their ideas from, here's your answer. And you get the answer from one of the most famous of today's popular writers. King doesn't just try to answer these illusive questions, in typical story-teller fashion he attempts to SHOW the process.<br /><br />On Writing is an inspirational journey and a very personal one. I'm happy to admit I chuckled a lot, choked back tears, and writhed at the description of a doctor bursting young Stevie's eardrums. King can still tell a story. This is a book I know I'll refer to often for inspiration, and for that feeling that someone else knows what it's like to spend time at this writing thing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a fan of the movies (sci-fi in particular) but passed on \\"Serenity\\" (the feature film based on \\"Firefly\\") when it was in the theaters. I heard it was based on a cancelled TV show, so I figured I wouldn't \\"get it.\\" When \\"Serenity\\" came out on video, I decided it was time to have a look. Long story short -- I REALLY enjoyed it, and then did the next logical thing: I decided to check out the TV series that led up to it. That was a good decision on my part; a very good one.  <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\" is about a crew of good-hearted space pirates several hundred years in the future that are just trying to make ends meet. They have a ship, the Serenity, and pass their time going from planet to planet on the \\"outer rim\\" of civilization in the galaxy, picking up \\"jobs\\" that pay (i.e., stealing) and trying to avoid Federation authorities and the Reavers (some great bad guys).  <br /> <br />Ok, so how is it? In a word, \\"Firefly\\" is fantastic -- mesmerizing (ok, two words). I couldn't stop watching it, one episode after another. ALL of the episodes are great; there ain't a clunker in the bunch. I can't remember being this hooked by a TV series since the \\"Sopranos\\" came out on video. I love the futuristic setting and the glimpses of how our civilization has progressed, the fleshed-out 3-D characters, the sharp dialogue, and the interesting situations that the crew finds itself in.  <br /> <br />I have no idea how this show could have been cancelled. It could only have been done by someone looking at numbers, not someone who had actually watched the show.  <br /> <br />The characters are especially good -- the kind you wish you could spend more time with and get to know even better when you are done watching. The cast works extremely well together and that's was one of the primary things that drew me in -- you can tell there were no big egos in the group and that everyone was having fun. If you watch the extras (for the series, and with \\"Serenity\\"), you will hear the same message from them directly. It sounds like they had a blast, and it shows.  <br /> <br />It's just an added bonus that they're all easy on the eyes. You probably won't have heard of anyone associated with this series (except maybe Joss Whedon, the auteur, or perhaps Ron Glass, the actor from \\"Barney Miller\\" back in the 1970s), but you might be inclined to look them up on the internet after you finish watching.  <br /> <br />They are all great, but Nathan Fillion stands out as the Captain, \\"Mal\\" (short for Malcolm, although I wouldn't be surprised if its a double entendre). He is simply a great actor, and I can't wait to see where he turns up next. Two other favorites of mine are Summer Glau and Morena Baccarin, excellent actresses and beautiful to boot.  <br /> <br />The scripts are excellent too -- lots of word-play humor and, just as importantly, the characters say things that you would expect people to say in their situations. The slow-burn flirting between two main characters is handled particularly well.  <br /> <br />In case you think I've suspended all critical thinking and become an unthinking sci-fi zealot, let me pick a few nits as well. First, technology does not seem to have progressed very far in many ways from what it is now. In particular, it seems odds that people ae still pretty much firing off 20th century guns when the shooting starts. Second, there is a fair amount of violence in many episodes and a fair number of people die. A couple times the three main \\"fighting\\" characters seemed to take death and killing people a little too much in stride. On the other hand, they *are* essentially pirates or bandits, life is cheap, and they do abide by a code that basically requires them to do everything possible to avoid killing people. But if someone tries to kill them first...  <br /> <br />That's really about it when it comes to things that made me stop and think about for a minute...but those thoughts pass quickly and then I come back to thinking what a great show this is.  <br /> <br />So who should buy this? I would recommend it to *everyone* except those who might have a problem with the violence, which gets heavy at times. You know who you are. There is a little swearing, but it's all in Chinese! (it will make perfect sense when you watch it). As a parent of two young children (ages 6 and 8) who are just getting into Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc., I briefly considered watching it with my kids, but the show is really intended for adults. Someday, though....  <br /> <br />You don't see many products on Amazon that average a 5-star rating, especially when 2500 people have their say. You don't need to be a sci-fi fan, you just need to be able to appreciate high-quality entertainment when you see it. As you will see on Joss Whedon's humorous introduction to the series, this whole project was a labor of love. That comes through in every single episode.  <br /> <br />So, why are you still reading this? :)
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is fantastic.  There are some reviews that say that the album has too slow of a feel to it or that it is just garbage because it doesnt sound like the Chili's of decades past.  If anything, the band has evolved into a more rock feel and sounds awesome.  Flea's basslines are still powerful and stand out in the songs while Fruciante's guitar playing is really showcased on the album.  I'd have to say that I was a little bit skeptical when i heard that RHCP was releasing 28 songs simultaneously but now i feel like it was definately the right move.  Personally, i'm a fan of the Jupiter disk over mars but some standouts on the album include: <br /> <br />Dani California, <br />Snow (Hey Oh), <br />Charlie, <br />Hump de Bump, <br />Torture Me, <br />Strip My Mind, <br />Wet Sand, <br />and Storm in a Teacup <br /> <br />I haven't listened to anything else since i got it yesterday morning and I've listened through the album a few times.  The biggest piece of advice i can give to anybody that starts off skeptical is to listen through it a few times and let it grow on you.  It definately will...
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Wow. I'm a huge Chili Peppers fan, but I'm a bigger John Frusciante fan. And you can totally hear his influence on this album more than  on any other album they have put out, even more than Californication and By The Way. Even saying that, this double album goes back to their funk roots much more than By The Way did, and manages to somehow mix the funk in with Frusciante's melodic genius. The result is an instant classic that is going to be on everyone's play list for years. I can totally see Stadium Arcadium being listened to for decades to come. All four members bring their very best to the table, and it totally shows. To steal a line I read on the RollingStone.com review, this release is easily on the same level as some other band's greatest hits albums. Every song is strong, and the sound is consistently original and unique. Is it perfect? No, it's not absoutely perfect. But it is very, very, VERY good. A must-buy if you are a Chili Peppers fan of any era, and even if you aren't it definitely deserves a listen. A fantastic CD worthy of your attention, don't pass it up.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|This is a good album (if you look past the publicity).<br /><br />A lot of \\"underground\\" people just love to hate on A7X because they're on MTV, if I was a narrow minded idiot I'd hate them too. But you can't judge a band on how popular they are (or what they look like for that matter) music is about MUSIC nothing eles.<br /><br />This album isn't as good as Sounding The Seventh Trumpet (then again, not much is) but it's still worth buying.<br /><br />M. Shadow's voice is a little obnoxious at first, but after you listen to the CD a couple times you'll get it.<br /><br />I'm sure everyone who's reading this has heard Bat Country or Beast And The Harlot. So you know what you're expecting with this album, amazing guitar solo's, and all around fantastic musicianship.<br /><br />Don't listen to the bad reviews or your big tough underground friends, buy this cd... it won't make you any less \\"hardcore\\".
B0001611DI|5.0|Although I enjoyed the remake as a good action film, the original Dawn of the Dead is a horror comic come to life. So what if some of the zombies are blue, the blood is pink, or a guns and ammo store defies zoning ordinances by showing up in the mall! It's a comic book and those things don't matter when you're engrossed in the idea of the story. In the remake, people seek refuge inside a mall from the zombie scourge. In the original, people conquer the mall because of the zombies. These people don't want to leave the mall, they're forced to leave by a bunch of biker hooligans who mess their utopian land of consumerism. Throughout their journey from lows to highs to lows again, we're treated to a zombie who's partially beheaded by helicopter blades, a few great zombie bites were chunks of meat are taken out of a few arms, legs, and necks, and one groovy shot gun blast to the head of one poor unsuspecting public housing resident.  <br /> <br />If you want great state of the art special effects and nonstop action, then the remake is your film. If you want a better story that you can watch more than once, then pop in this original. I like them both, but I like this one over and over again. <br /> <br />I own this dvd (single disc) and find the extras satisfactory. There are no documentaries, but I like the commentary which takes place right in Romero's own home.  <br />
0694003611|5.0|This book in one of my daughter's favorites and I read it to her every night before bedtime for a couple of years.  It's a classic with not only captivating prose, but great illustrations that your child will love.  I'd recommend getting the companion book, \\"My World\\" also by Margaret Wise Brown.  It's more of a 'daytime' book, but still a wonder.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|Overall the album show a mature Shakira who hasn't forgotten her original style.  It hasn't been since \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones?\\" that Shakira has really made an album that balances rock style and hardcore ballads. <br /> <br />How Do You Do- One of her best songs ever.  In this rock inspired song she talks about not just her faith, but that of others.  She has questions, questions a lot of us ask in our heads but never say verbally (hence oral fixation). 5/5 <br /> <br />Illegal- A song she does with Santana, it is a rock-style ballad that talks about the pain she feels when leaving a relationship. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Hips Don't Lie- A song with Wyclef Jean that is a partial remake of his Dirty Dancing song \\"Dance Like This\\".  This hip-hop/latin sounding song is an obvious hit when hearing it.  It really breathes life into the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />Animal City-  A great song that sounds flamenco inspired.  Here she speaks about people trying to bring you down when they find out you are famous. 5/5 <br /> <br />Don't Bother- This song reminds me of classic Shakira.  She incorporates humor (\\"practices tai chi\\") with a hard hitting sound and topic. 5/5 <br /> <br />The Day and The Time- A song she does with Gustavo Cerati sounds very positive and uplifting. 4/5 <br /> <br />Dreams for Plans- A ballad that starts off really slow, but later develops a steady beat.  Best ballad in the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />Hey You-  The music sounds very comedic here.  The song as a whole sounds very carnival style with typical Shakira humor. 5/5 <br /> <br />Your Embrace- A ballad, but I found this one to be dispensible.  It's just o.k. 2/5 <br /> <br />Costume Makes The Clown-  Here she pick up on some of the topics covered in \\"Laundry Service\\" (\\"told you I felt lucky with my humble breast\\") and makes it extremely catchy with a rock setting. 5/5 <br /> <br />Something- A French-inspired ballad, this is one of her best songs on the CD in terms of lyrics.  Here Shakira is in love, and to her it seems perfect. 5/5 <br /> <br />Timor- Comic relief is the main element here with this song that tries to bring forth political awareness.  She makes strong statements about politicians and an individual's place in the world.  The hard sound makes it even better! 5/5 <br /> <br />La Tortura- The Spanglish re-release of her first hit off the oral fixation series is a good way to end the album on a high note.  It shows her eclectic taste in music, language, and artists she works with. 5/5

0307276902|4.0|I bought this book after the Oprah incident.  I agree with a lot of other readers. Who cares if some or most of it was fabricated? It was a very good read.  As far as I'm concerned that's all that matters.  I enjoyed meeting the characters in the book.  I also enjoyed the way it was written - very different.  There is no way that this book deserves anything less than 3 stars.  Frey is a good author and this was a great book!
B000EMGAOY|1.0|Absolute waste of money!  Hillel is spinning in his grave! Anthony needs to stop trying to sing and get back to the funk/rap that made the peppers.  I'm not sure if it is their age or lack of drugs, but they should just hang it up. <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|okay, i was skimming through the reviews and noticed people complaining about how this album is bad, or isnt like other red hot chili pepper albums. in my opinion almost every track on here has a counter part featured on a previous chili peppers album. im not saying the songs sound exactly like other songs, but this collection of songs is more of a view of the peppers career as a whole. <br />*= personal favorites ( i know theres alot of them ) <br /> <br />Dani California- 8/10 after extensive radio play this song has        burned out somewhat for me, but overall good song, great chorus <br /> <br />*Snow ((Hey Oh))- 9/10 this song is mellow and features some great guitar work, a standout track on Jupiter <br /> <br />*Charlie - 8/10 the lyrics are somewhat mindless, but it's got some great hooks and it brings back some classic peppers funk <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium - 9/10 the californication of the first disc, great slow tune <br /> <br />*Hump De Bump - 9/10 another standout track, im liking the funk thrown in this record, conisdering By the Way was lacking in this area. <br /> <br />*She's Only 18- 8/10 this song instantly clicked with me, while not perfect its got a good feel to it, and some nice solo work <br /> <br />Slow Cheetah- 7/10 this song is a bit long and slow, its doesnt mix well with the disc, its about out of place if you ask me, not too bad <br /> <br />*Tortue Me - 9/10 picks the pace back up, features some nice trumpet work, overall a pretty rockin song <br /> <br />*Strip My Mind - 9/10 i love the feel of this song, its a nice mellow rock song, features some excellent vocals <br /> <br />*Especially In Michigan- 9/10 this is a great song, and one you'll be wanting to come back to <br /> <br />*Warlocks -9/10 one word \\"Rockapotomus\\" <br /> <br />C'mon Girl- 8/10 alot of this album depends on the style of chili peppers you like, if you like it all ( like me) the better. but this is another slower somewhat funky song <br /> <br />*Wet Sand- 8/10 a tad bit long, but its a great song nonetheless (notice the last minute or so is almost identical to John F's solo album To Record Water for Ten Days' 'Murderer') <br /> <br />Hey- 7/10 i dont really know about this song. i think it needs some time to grow <br /> <br />Overall i'd say the 1st disc is full of hits and things new and old pepper fans can appreciate. its not too slow like many people claim.  <br /> <br />I havent had time to listen to 2nd disc as much, and i wouldnt be doing it any justice if i fully reviewed it so heres a mini review : <br /> <br />Mars- overall 8/10 it's got its standout tracks Tell Me Baby, 21st Century, Readymade, Storm In A Teacup just to name a few and a personal top track for me is Desecration Smile. this disc is definately faster, but also features more experimental material, so alot of this stuff is new for even long time fans. theres never a \\"been there done that\\" feel on this disc. <br /> <br />I would say after a few listens through theres no standout tracks that scream \\"single\\", but maybe thats because all the songs are good. if you havent ever picked up a RHCP album its a good time to start, i might not suggest this to be the first but definately conisder picking this up. To fans,(like myself) this contains ALOT of stuff so theres a little something for everybody. i might also mention nearly every song features a John F solo somewhere (which is a good thing, as many of them are downright incredible in todays world of commercial pop-rap) <br /> <br />hopefully this is helpful <br />until the next RHCP album, ~peace out~
006056251X|5.0|What more can I say that previous reviewers haven't already praised? I worried that my impression of Sebastian in the latter part of Lillian's story would tarnish this reading but Kleypas immediately reminds you why he's completely irresistible. From the moment Evie and Sebastien are thrust into that carriage bound for Gretna Green,  he's done nothing but melt your heart. I won't go into too much detail after that, it's always better to read the book for yourself.<br /><br />I've said this in another Wallflower review but I'll say it again: I love how Lisa Kleypas has ventured to a more comedic, light-hearted tone because she's  really made it her own. There's no other book I look more forward to reading than Daisy's story, \\"Scandal in Spring.\\" This has definitely been one of the best series I've read so far.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|Everything up to and including Blood Sugar Sex Magik are great.  One Hot Minute had its moments, but Calfornication was bad, By The Way was worse, and Stadium Arcadium is just plain Garbage.  Save your money.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The double disc album is absolutely amazing.  Its not like they're albums in the past.. which are great aswell.  They have grown into a fantastic band and they sound great together.
B0000025T6|4.0|others have said how great this album is - i just thought i'd add a comment about the sound quality.  i believe these are demo tapes, and in my (completely unprofessional - please, someone who knows better correct me if i mix things up!) opinion they're pretty good for that.  but they are not well recorded.  what i want to try to explain is that, at least to my ears, the poor quality doesn't detract from the music.<br /><br />the two main problems i hear are poor dynamic range/levels and excess echo/reverb.  the first problem means that loud sounds are sometimes distorted (particularly the vocals), which can make you wince, but it's an intermittent problem and gives a raw edge that matches the material.  the second is perhaps more a matter of taste - some reverb with vocal/acoustic guitar is a good thing, but this may be a bit rich.  on the other hand it might help cover up some of the distortion.  or maybe i'm confusing the two.<br /><br />there's also a third problem on a couple of tracks where the instruments are more \\"closely\\" miked than the vocals.  so you get the impression that you're listening to a distant singer playing a guitar close by.  but the better tracks (in my opinion) are the more \\"intimate\\" ones, where the vocal is as close as the instruments and this problem does not occur.<br /><br />whatever.  what i'm trying to get round to saying is: that's it.  frequency response is pretty much ok, i think, as is the balance between voice and instruments.  so despite the problems it works, because the problems match the contents.<br /><br />in other words - it's worth it.  this is good music.
B000AMWIVM|2.0|After i rented it I went up to people and went \\"I saw Saw!\\" It sounded stupid i dont like repeating myself like that because you know I like have a really big vocabulary and that makes i tlook like I have a really small one.  it was even when the other person said \\"i saw saw 2\\" because then I like couldn't tell if they saw saw too or saw Saw 2 you know it was totally confusing.  It was like this one time at work because i'm a waiter you know and well, this dude told me hed give me a big tip but when i wnet to his table after he left I just found this note that said \\"give better service\\" i mean, WTF?  that wasnt nice. and Where was the tip you know?  i hate that dude.     <br />Anyway the movies pretty cool i guess.  i liked Hostel better though it was rad
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I'm not a \\"fanboy\\" of the Red Hot Chili Peppers (or any other band, for that matter), but I feel compelled, as a lover of music, to express my thoughts on this latest offering from my favorite middle-aged foursome.   <br /> <br />It is rare to find a good album these days.  When I say a \\"good\\" album, I'm talking about a disc that can spin in my car or home stereo, front to back, without skipping any songs.  I'm talking about an album that surprises you each time you listen to it because you forget that \\"that song\\" was on there!  A good album is fun, exciting, diverse, well-crafted, creative, and explores the full capabilities of the artists who recorded it.   <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium is not just ONE \\"good\\" album, it's TWO.  I fully expected at least half of this collection to be absolutely useless, musically.  I expected to have to use my fast forward button more than usual and to inevitably be forced to burn a mix cd of my \\"favorite\\" songs.  The only problem with this collection of songs is that I have to take one disc out in order to play the other one!   <br /> <br />This is the Red Hot Chili Peppers at their finest in every way.  Musically, lyrically, and in every other way, this double album is everything I knew the Chili Peppers COULD do, but never thought they WOULD.  They have scratched every itch I had for this project at least once (sometimes, they scratch several times until the itch is nearly gone!).  I think that offering this hearty bunch of near-perfect songs to the fans after an already distinguished resume says a lot about this band.  They sound like they really ENJOYED putting this project together.   <br /> <br />First of all, the musicianship on this album is second to none.  I'm not a musician, but I listen to TONS of music and this stuff just sounds like candy!  Chad Smith is the perfect drummer for this band.  Flea's basslines are so crisp they seem impossible.  John Frusciante's guitar work is something that can't be overstated.  His ability to create soundscapes and texture and mood in a song is uncanny.  Anthony Kiedis' voice has peaked at just the right time and his lyrics seem to flow out of him just as naturally as breathing.   <br /> <br />The album seems almost effortless to listen to, with absolutely NO \\"stinkers\\" on it and plenty of barn-burners to go around.  As for \\"Jupiter\\" (the first disc), it is an almost perfect journey through everything you would expect from a band in their prime.  They push every button; they bombard with riffs, solos, basslines and grooves that I never knew they still had in 'em.  Talking about each individual song would take too long, but sufficeth to say, they're all indispensible to this first disc.  If the album had only been one disc, Jupiter would be more than enough!   <br /> <br />When Mars attacks with the gem, Desecration Smile and then leads into Tell Me Baby and Hard to Concentrate, THAT'S when I nearly wet my britches.  How in the WORLD do we still have great songs left over for this second disc?  I would've been staggered if those three songs would have been the only good ones left, but they're not.  They're followed by some of the most funked-out, lean-back-and-smile-while-you-play-air-guitar, joygasmic songs I've ever heard.  As the final notes of Turn It Again played through my Camry's speakers, I realized the tremendous feat that the Chili Peppers had pulled off:  They have made TWO GREAT ALBUMS and sold them for the price of one.  They have given an immeasureable gift to all music lovers for years to come.  The density, texture, and sonic forest of Stadium Arcadium is something I will enjoy exploring indefinitely.  There are more hooks in this album than a bait & tackle expo.  It will literally take YEARS to even get to the point where you could possibly be \\"tired\\" of this many good songs!   <br /> <br />I want to truly thank the Chili Peppers for giving us this piece of their lives and this ripe, juicy fruit of their labor.  If they ever readthis, I hope they know how much their work is appreciated.
B0002IQHY8|3.0|Indeed he does.  On the opener, Return To Tunguska, he makes a special guest appearance. <br /> <br />This is a very weak album from Parsons.  Very little of it is worth listening to.  The songs More Lost Without You, We Play the Game, and You Can Run all feature sappy lyrics with little or no real signature marks that make them different from every other song out there.  Tijuaniac and L'arc en Ciel (rainbow in French) are both slightly better instrumentals, but aren't great. <br /> <br />This leaves four good songs.  The first is Return to Tunguska, but it is a little long, and doesn't really do enough to fill almost nine minutes.  Also, I didn't realize that David Gilmour was on the album until I read the credits, as his guitar on this track is not his best. <br /> <br />Mammagamma '04 is decent, but the original (on Eye in the Sky) was much better, and so this song not only lacks originality, but it doesn't even improve the original. <br /> <br />A Recurring Dream Withing a Dream is the best song on the album.  It is a combination of two works for Tales of Mystery and Imagination, the Raven and A Dream Within a Dream.  Unlike Mammagamma 04, this song drastically improves both the originals.  The opening is very good (this part came from A Dream Within a Dream), and the rest is from the Raven, and is also very good. <br /> <br />The album ends with Chomolungma, an interesting instrumental with chanting, but is not as good as Return To Tunguska or Mammagamma 04 (except for the originality). <br /> <br />It would seem to me that when three of the top four songs on a non-instrumental album are instrumentals, and when two of the top four (including the very best) are remakes of older songs, there is something wrong with the CD.  Honestly, nothing on here is necessary if you're a fan of the Alan Parsons Project.  If you're an electronica fan, go for it.  But keep in mind that this CD is nothing special, and that you could essentially go out and buy the same thing froma hundred other bands.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|Ok I have to jump on the packaging bandwagon because let's face it, we wouldn't drop this much $ if we didn't already like the show.  I have only gotten to season 4 but 2 of the episodes skip and are almost impossible to watch-one of them is one of my favorites.<br /><br />I never saw SATC on tv but I always enjoyed it on dvd.  I am happy w/the special features of the set.
B000002U8G|5.0|We used to call it \\"acid rock.\\"  Other practitioners were Amon Duul II, Can, Hawkwind, Van der Graaf Generator, Ash Ra Tempel and other more ephemeral acts whose names I forget.  There's been a great resurgance in interest in this type of music, and in the last ten years bands like Flying Saucer Attack and Bardo Pond have pushed it's bounderies much further than we could have hoped for back in the early 70s.  All that notwithstanding, this remains at the pinnacle of the genre, mainly because of the transcendent (originally side long) \\"Echoes.\\"  It has exactly the right trajectory, if you know what I mean, and the amazing middle section with Gilmour's twisted lead (listen to that perfect controlled feedback) over a totally destructive rhythm loop should be entitled \\"music for peaking.\\"  I still have my original vinyl copy purchased in 1972, and it sounds just as awesomely heavy as it ever did.  Long before Spacemen 3, we were taking drugs to listen to music made by people who were taking drugs to make music to take drugs to. In that vein, this is the real deal, and any young people whose exposure to Floyd is limited to \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wall\\" should pick this up immediately.  If you're like most of us old-time Floyd fans, it will become one of your favorite albums of all time.
B000000W5L|5.0|Incredible. After listening to Sirius and the stones channel, I discovered this Album. What a masterpiece. Bluesy Rock, what ever happened to it?
B00003CWL6|2.0|Written by a Hollywood hack t.v. writer (Alan Ball) whose own grade-b sitcom had recently bombed. And so he thinks to himself: Ha! I'll try my hand at feature film writing! Result: A feature film that plays like a grade-b t.v. sitcom.    This film completely and totally panders to stereotypical self-righteous liberal values. \\"The emptiness of the institution of marriage, the emptiness of child-rearing, the emptiness of capitalism, the emptiness of life itself.\\"  And also: \\"Don't blame people, the victims of all of this nonsense and insanity.\\"     This film completely overlooks the fact that not one of its characters (and I mean CHARACTERS) even mildly attempts to lift a finger to find themselves out of their morass. Instead, they wallow in it.  Not one of these self-indulgent, self-righteous, hedonistic, self-centered, self-absorbed people attempts to critique themselves and look in the mirror.  Their problems are the fault of everybody and everything else.      So what are we supposed to think, walking out of the movie theatre...?  Trouble with your marriage?  Get divorced.  Trouble with people at work?  Trash them and quit the job. Trouble with life in general?  Retire to your garage and smoke pot.     Empty values, empty characters, empty movie.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's Chariot has honestly changed my life. I'm sure that most people think that this is exageration or whatever, but its the truth. Its an album that is charged with soul, Gavin seems to have poured his soul into this and you can hear it through the lyrics and the music. Especially in the stripped bonus disc. Every single song on this cd is out of this world. Gavin is an amazing songwriter and can play the stuff out of the piano. He has soul and his voice is so incredible, the thing he can do with it, just crazy. This is one of the few albums I own that I can listen to all the way through without my musical A.D.D. kicking in, meaning, I can listen to each song all the way through without flipping impatiently. The love songs are true and from the heart, and songs like \\"I Don't Want To Be\\" speak to everyone about life. The first time I heard that song was on One Tree Hill when Gavin was first getting famous and I couldn't believe that someone could write something like that. In fact, my dad thinks that's the best song Gavin has ever written. When my family was going through hard times at home, I put on Chariot and  life just seemed better. Musically and lyrically, its by far the best album and my favorite that I own. Buy this because it will change your opinion of music in general. Through Gavin's music, I  discovered better music.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Okay first off everybody complaining about the RHCP being soft, maybe your just not RHCP fans.  The bands decision to make whatever kind of music they want is THEIR decision remember now, they are the RHCP not you.  When metallica made the Black Album or Metallica then went on to make Load, everybody complained about them being soft or whatever.  Lars explained it perfectly who is anybody to tell them how to play their own music and their own style.   <br /> <br />I believed the Chili Peppers were at their musical peak on Californication and By the way, but I believe musically they have out done themselves.  This is the best singing wise AK has ever been, and John is a symphonic master, Fleas bass lines are good as ever, and chad keeps holding it down.   <br /> <br />Great tracks: <br />Wet Sand <br />Snow <br />Hard To Concentrate  <br />Strip my Mind <br />Dani California <br />Charlie <br />Torture me <br /> <br />However I like all of the songs on the albums, those are just some of my favorites after about 5 listents through both cd's. <br />As far as musicianship goes this is one of their finest, and their stuff is still Funkadelik as hell.  Just they have channeld their extreme funk riffs and rap flows into something new, different, more mature, and excelent.  If you have not picked this album up I would highly recomend going and getting it right now.
1932907009|5.0|After having read several how-to books on screenwriting I found myself needing something else--what exactly I wasn't sure.  I've written a short, and have a number of others in progress, but the prospect of a feature length script seemed daunting. <br /> <br />On a hunch I bought this and I'm really glad I did.  Despite making my way through, among other books, McKee's \\"Story\\" (one of the few \\"must reads\\" for the amateur screewriter in my humble opinion), I still didn't have a clear idea of how to proceed--that is, until Blake Snyder's \\"Save the Cat.\\"  Snyder's Beat Sheet and Board ideas are worth their weight in gold and I'm happy as hell I chanced upon them at this point in my writing process.  I almost immediately recognized them as being solutions to my major stumbling blocks as a writer. <br /> <br />The rest of the book contains very useful advice and insight as well, and it's all written in a humorous, friendly and engaging style. <br /> <br />Memento--I liked the movie quite a bit, although I can understand Snyder's reaction.  Maybe Carrie-Anne Moss clouds my judgement.  Who knows... <br /> <br />Blake, thank you for writing this book.
B000F1IQMS|5.0|I have always been a Steven Spielberg fan, and have enjoyed all his movies with the single exception of Saving Private Ryan (yes, I might be the only person in the world who did not like that movie - I felt it was too gruesome, and I hated the shakey camera filming) so I might be somewhat biased when it comes to him.  Yet this film, which portrays both the internal and external political struggles of terrorism, and the personal impact for one man and his family of being an active participant in retaliation (more terrorism), was a moving film.  <br /> <br />   Of greatest personal signifigance was a scene where the team from Israel was rented a safehouse that had also been rented by members of the PLO for the same time frame.  This scene developed the argument between Palestine and Israel in a way that I believe most people, like me, who are not Arabic, or Jewish, can understand.  This is so important for people, ESPECIALLY Americans, to comprehend.  Yet for some reason, many Americans just don't get it.   <br /> <br />   What has happened historically in this region, and within the last 75 years, is that the Allies (from WWII) displaced the Palestian People, removed them from the homes they felt they owned, they had mortgages on, they had decorated, they had raised thier children in... just like the homes we live in in the USA, in order to restore Israel's people to their beloved holy land, from biblical times.  This would be the equavelent of moving all the people from Rhode Island into say, Central Florida.  Taking all the current residents of Central Florida forcibly out of their homes, and moving them to they Keys. There is no way that doing this would be without major problems. As American's we would not allow this to happen, so why is the world so suprised that Palestine is angry? <br /> <br />   This movie touches upon the feelings of a Palestinan in one scene, and in the next, that same Palestianian is gunned down. It also depicts the Jewish reaction to Palestine, on two levels; the political and the righteous. This sceries of two scenes is so telling of the reality of this situation.  I felt that this alone worth the money for this DVD.   <br /> <br />   Of course there is much more to this movie! <br /> <br />   When a Jewish man says to another Jewish man, \\"come, break bread with me\\", and the other man turns away, it forces you to look at the personal issues faced by each member of any terrorist team.  Who does an assassin break bread with?   <br /> <br />   Is there any sense at all to the impact of terrorism?  No!  Not for the terrorist (if they have a heart), and not for the people he fights for.   <br /> <br />   I am not exactly sure Mr. Spielberg would agree with me that this is the movies most important message, but it is what I took away from it.  I know that anyone who watches this movie, will be touched by it.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Sure, it's vintage Tool but it sounds like they've got to the stage where they have a 'formula' for making a Tool song and won't deviate from it.  <br /> <br />I'm glad they've stuck to their roots but at the same time, I wanted to be challenged. I think they are giving the fans the quick fix.
B000092ZYX|5.0|First of all, to the last reviewer, this isn't their last album, they will be coming out with their seventh album probably sometime in early 2007 I'm thinking (they have yet to sign with a label).  Anyways though, this album in my opinion is equally as magnificent as The Bends, OKC, Kid A, and Amnesiac!  They have never really repeated themselves and this album goes into yet another new direction just like all the other ablums do, and sounds a lot different from anything else they've ever done!  I don't know a really great way to review this album, so I'll just rate each song on a scale of 1 - 10 :)  1.2+2=5 - 8/10 Great song/beginning for the ablum!  2.Sit Down. Stand Up. - 8/10 Another great piano-driven song from RH!  3.Sail to the Moon - 10/10 A superb song i think! IDK I just really love the piano and guitar work that's here! Also, great atmospheric song too!  4.Backdrifts - 7/10 good song, i owned this album for a whole year before it finally clicked with me.  5.Go to Sleep - 9/10 Excellent rock song! Really though, this is the song that got me into RH :)  6.Where I End and You Begin - 8/10 Great song! Phil Selway's drumming and Colin Greenwood's bass are awesome on this one, as well as Thom's voice and lyrics!  7.We Suck Young Blood - 9/10 Yet another fantastic song, took me a couple listens to get into this one. Really different from anything they've ever done!  8.The Gloaming - 8/10 Pretty great song, again though, one might have to listen to this one atleast a couple times to get into it.  9.There There - 9/10 Awesome song that really goes places :) I have no idea why it took me awhile to really appreciate this track, Ed and Jonny's drumming in this one makes it special though!  10.I Will - 8/10 Really good song that's a great change of pace I think. Simplistic but that's not a bad thing :)  11.A Punchup at a Wedding - 8/10 Great song, love the lyrics.  12.Myxomatosis - 7/10 Good song, it's quite creative and unlike anything i've heard before.  13.Scatterbrain - 9/10 Awesome song with great guitar and drum work and of course as always great vocals from Thomy boy!  14.A Wolf at the Door - 9/10 Unbelievable outro! Very creative! How do they come up with this stuff?!  All in all, I think all the songs here are good, so of course I think it's worth buying :) As with all Radiohead albums, give it time and you just may see how brilliant these guys really are, and that risk-taking is the best way to go! Anyway, if you want to get a bunch of info on Radiohead's next album, go to Green Plastic's website, I'm always reading what some of these guys have to say and most of them are pretty insightful and optimistic about the future of Radiohead and so am I :)
B000AYQLX6|5.0|This is a very strong album by John Lennon despite what some people (and even Amazon) write and say. True, there's a little bit of filler in the song \\"Ya Ya,\\" but it's sweet that he worked with son Julian for the song and it's not intended to be the focal point of the album.<br /><br />Particularly strong songs on the CD include both the studio recording and the live concert recording with Elton John of \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night,\\" \\"Bless You,\\" \\"Scared,\\" \\"#9 Dream,\\" and both versions of \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out).\\" John may not have been at his best but I for one would never have guessed it. The electricity in both versions (studio and live with Elton John) of \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\" is intense!<br /><br />I am very impressed by John's lyrics for the song \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out).\\" There's a sad truth to it and John's philosophy about life is too often the reality:<br /><br />Nobody loves you when you're down<br /><br />  and out<br /><br />Nobody knows you when you're on<br /><br />  cloud nine<br /><br />Everybody's hustlin' for a buck and a dime<br /><br />I'll scratch your back and you knife mine<br /><br />\\"Bless You\\" was equally moving. John sings about his love for a woman who is now in the arms of another man. He pines for her and I could identify with his sadness based on my own life experiences as I'm sure many people can. This is a very good, strong ballad that will strike a nerve in many of you! The ending interview with John is also nicely done.<br /><br />The quality of the sound is excellent. I do agree with people who notice a slight hypocrisy in that when Yoko remastered this album (which was made during a time John spent temporarily separated from Yoko) she chose to morph his picture with hers on the actual CD itself. I don't think that's reflective of the way John felt about Yoko when much of this album was recorded.<br /><br />The liner notes are excellent. They include all the lyrics (except for the very few words uttered in \\"Ya Ya\\") and the song credits are given, too. A great plus! Lennon and Beatles fans will recognize the name of Jim Keltner on drums. Jesse Ed Davis does a great job on guitar, too. I'm sorry that some people were disappointed as they expected that John's tongue would still pop out at them when they opened the CD cover. The CD cover, as I'm sure they know, was made the way it was to save a few bucks on the manufacturing expenses. However, you do get copies of a few paintings John painted when he was young and I loved that!<br /><br />All in all, this CD is a must-have for Lennon fans, fans of rock and pop, and people who want to get familiar with John's work after The Beatles broke up. The album has a strong 1970's rock sound and feel to it with a huge side dish of passion, heart and soul.

0790729342|5.0|Later to be known as a man of dignity, honesty, and fragility, Mel Gibson is known to most ignorant men as a pansy. However, for the select few who can actually bare the man, we always come to our senses to watch this film whenever time is on our side. Once Mel was known for his survival instincts, keen street smarts, and his signature everyman-for-himself attitude. This movie proves that in all aspects...<br /><br />Max Rockatansky is the protoganist on the verge of collapse. His wife and child were murdered by a group of bikers, only later to be almost fully exacted on by Max single handedly.. He now runs life on the highway with his faithful canine and the champion Pursuit Special Interceptor. Suffering from disillusionment, society seems all to desperate in his eyes...just as desperate as he is to stay alive in search of pertroleum. What you will find throughout the movie from here will only bring you driving plot sequences and entertaining scenes that will keep you watching the whole way through. All the action never gets old, many instance come up that will make you have that tad laugh you want to let out, and the ending chase will leave you wanting to explore scene selection the next time around.<br /><br />The best way to sit through this is with an open mind, so be aware of things that you might not see in a normal action film. Now since this is science fiction, there will be many skeptics upon stupidity and pointless aspects to this film, but hopefully you will understand the true concept about this movie and everything that fills it.<br /><br />Anyways, this is a exemplary masterpiece in every way possible for a film. This is Mel the way he wanted to be portrayed in the beginning...raw, tough, and in your face. He makes sure you understand what kind of hell he has been through, and this movie is a veteran example of such reality. I highly recommend adding this to the library which you have forged, as it only reigns as an essential piece in film history. If you already purchased it before, give it another round. Only classics are worthy of so...ory. If you already purchased it before, give it another round. Only classics are worthy of so...
0007111584|5.0|I am attempting to order another copy of this wonderful book because my 40 year old son remembers my reading it to him as a little boy and he wants a copy for his two year old son!  The conversations you can have with your child as you examine the pages are incredible! Our copy is completely worn out, but I have saved it for when he visits!
B000ENWKN8|5.0|I would have given this album 4 out of 5 due to my one major gripe--the instrumental fillers scattered throughout. The reason for 5 stars then is because of some very strange reviews that dish out one star ratings for no GOOD reason. One reviewer said the album has no catchy songs--I cannot stop singing American Witch, Foxy Foxy, The Devil's Rejects or Lords of Salem. If it's groove you're after, look no further! I've always been a MASSIVE fan of White Zombie, but I just couldn't get into Rob's solo stuff--I personally don't care too much for Hellbilly Deluxe. What I'm probably getting at is that liking this album boils down to taste. Do you like White Zombie, Pantera, Brand New Sin, Corrosion of Conformity or Black Label Society? You'll Probably like this. If you like Hellbilly Deluxe era Rob, Deathstars, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson style power pop/shock rock, sample ridden music, then you'd probably be displeased with this release. As it stands though, this is no ground breaking album but to my ears at least its catchy as all hell. Looks like even Zombies have to grow up some time. Recommended.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|This review is not about the music. It is about the case that the CD is packaged in. While aesthetically clever and unique, the case is larger in width and length than a standard CD case (if there is such a thing). The depth is also reduced to about 1/4 the normal size, almost like a beverage coaster.<br /><br />The only reason this bothers me is because it is too large for my shelves. On the built-in CD rack, designed for \\"standard CD cases\\", this case simply will not fit in any angle. On a regular shelf where there is no limit to storage size, the only odd thing about the case is that is sticks out farther than other CD cases.<br /><br />I would say \\"case closed\\", but it's only my observation.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|If you are not a fan of Final Fantasy, the game, then you will be totally confused by the plot (I am not a fan, so the first 5 minutes mystified me) but the graphics and action scenes will keep you interested. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this to anyone who does not watch alot of anime but Fanal Fantasy VII will be a treat for any fans of shows like \\"Dragon Ball Z\\". The action in this film is fast and furious, displaying super-human people performing incredible feats of strength and speed.  <br /> <br />The animation is very similar to another Final Fantasy film, \\"The Spirits Within\\" - which has the same weaknesses: incredible animation, wacky/convoluted plot. The high quality of the animation is one of this film's saving graces. <br /> <br />Final Fantasy VII is packaged as a two disk set, filled with extras, so you get your money's worth. If you are a FF fan, then by all means buy this DVD. Anime fans will enjoy this one as well.
B00000JCB2|1.0|Limp Bizkit are without a doubt the worst band in existance! I just want to pull out a knife and stab that dumb fu** Fred Durst! I hate him more than words can explain. The guitarist is the worst guitarist in history! He plays 2 notes in all of their songs and thank god he doesn't solo. The DJ is also dumb and the only good thing he did was the DJ scratching on the Sepultura song \\"Lookaway\\" which was his only shining moment! The song \\"Nookie\\" is very overplayed on MTV and the lyrics on that song seem like they were written in 5 seconds! It seems like every Limp Bizkit album just gets worse. Their debut \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'all\\" although still abysmal was their least worse album. \\"Results May Vary\\" is their worse.<br /><br />Here's a sample of the chorus on \\"Nookie\\":<br /><br />I did it all for the nookie, c'mon<br /><br />The nookie, c'mon<br /><br />So you can take that cookie<br /><br />And stick it up your.. yeah!<br /><br />Stick it up your.. yeah!<br /><br />Stick it up your.. yeah!<br /><br />Stick it up your<br /><br />Wasn't that horrible?! Well listen to the entire album and prepare to vomit...
0451191153|4.0|I love and hate this book at the same time.      I love it because I have never read anything like it.  It engaged me, challenged me, made me angry and happy.  But most of all, it questioned my viewpoint on life, my relationships, my own agenda and my quest for happiness.  And that is what I believe a book above all should do to its reader.    I hate it because Howard Roark, the hero of the book, is so idealized.  Everyone else in this books struggles with their demons, their place in society and their relationships with each other.  Roark, however, is different.  He appears to have it all figured out.  He always knows what to say and what to do.  There are never any doubts, no regrets, hardly any pains.  I asked myself: how does he do it and how did he get to this point?  He is supposed to epitomize the ideal of happiness and content.  But in that ideal, he seems so inhuman.  He actually does not seem like a real person.  Where you would expect a character to struggle with a decision, Roark storms forward without any faltering.  If Rand intended Roark to be the person that we should all strive to be, I cannot figure out how to be him.    The curious thing about the book is that all the other characters actually depict the human traits that you expect in a fictional character.  There is the woman who seems to have everything except for love and happiness.  There is the man, who has risen from the slums of poverty by working hard and corrupting others.  There is the man who lives through the opinion of others and is never truly himself, and there is the man who has figured out how to construct public opinions through his own manipulations.  All these characters struggle, all of them develop, change, come to an awareness of themselves.  Only Roark is the same on page 1 as he is on page 700.    Yes, this is a long book, but don't be discouraged by its length of Roark's idealized character.  The story keeps you going and the interweaving of plot lines is fantastic.  Read it!  Really read it, even if you don't believe in Objectivism or Rand's theories.  You will find that besides its faults and ideals, it is a fantastic read that will surely challenge your outlook on life.
0345457692|3.0|This book contains multiple chapters depicting nothing but graphically detailed sex. Then once you get past that, you get to read about the main character, former ex-UN envoy Kovacs blowing numerous heads off shoulders, sometimes just for kicks. Maybe I'm not ready to admit to being so desensitized by our pop culture, or maybe I just missed the irony of this genre called cyberpunk.  <br /> <br />In any case, the plot was somewhat difficult to follow, so plan on reading this one carefully if you actually care about the story (although I gather that true fans of this genus really only care about the sex and blood). Also, the whole concept of real death is quite timely in our day and age as we get closer and closer to the actual ability to clone humans. Altered Carbon's particular \\"brand\\" of cloning is basically done by writing a person's conscience to a computer chip and implanting it in the brain stem. When the body dies the conscience is simply transplanted to a new body (or sleeve). A person is not truly dead (real death) until the chip is destroyed. <br /> <br />Overall, a good concept was somewhat ruined for me by the gratuitous sex and violence. I guess Morgan figured he could make a few extra sales to teenage boys if he threw in these sections. <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|when I heard its a double album and it has 28 songs the first thing that came to my mind was...i'm never going to finish listening to it but after the first 2 songs I was hooked!! This album is a new masterpiece of the 21st century!<br /><br />Listen to song like:<br /><br />- Especially In Michigan<br /><br />- Snow (Hey Oh)<br /><br />- She's Only 18<br /><br />- Tell Me Baby<br /><br />- Readymade<br /><br />After listening to the second disc it came up to me that they sound a bit like Led Zeppelin..some songs the way they are structured and the chorus with the guitar solos...it's like listening to a modern day Zeppelin!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Quite possibly the greatest album created... 10,000 Days stands alone today, in a music industry saturated in failing shallow phony pop idols, and delivers a refreshing sound that rings true through to the soul.  Once again, TOOL remarkably incorporates visual 3D art (with stereoscopic glasses included in the packaging), with inspirational soul rattling music (with profound lyrics included in the song) to coagulate a magnificent triumph of art, philosophy, spirituality, and thought.
B000EULJLU|5.0|For the dedicated Tool fan, elitist Tool snob, or even casual passerby fan, I would offer these words of advice, take them or leave them: <br /> <br />1. If you know anything at all about Tool, you know that it takes time to appreciate their work. Unlike easily digestible candy like... anything on the radio, Tool's music is very dense, complicated, and progressive. If you agree with that, then surely you would agree that it's A BIT EARLY FOR OVER ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE TO OFFER A WORTHWHILE OPINION/REVIEW OF THE ALBUM MERE WEEKS AFTER IT'S RELEASE. So many listeners have commented on how long it took them to appreciate Lateralus, only to follow their comments with judgement on this album. GIVE IT TIME. Just look at how many Lateralus reviews confess that the album grew on them over the years. Time allows for an album to sink in. <br /> <br />2. Saying one album is better than another is a defeatist way of rating an album; try judging it on it's own terms. Does it rule? Does it suck? An album can still be a five AND be less favored when compared to a past release by the band. It's a seperate album with seperate intentions, sounds, motivations. Hell, it may as well be considered a differnt band; five years is a long time. Time allows the listener to further seperate one album from the last. <br /> <br />Yeah, I kind of went against my little rant by giving the album a five so early, but I'm guessing the album isn't going to sound WORSE in five years. And I had to put something...

It was more than just one of noble ambition or grandeur of design; Johnny's virtues were just as hard-fought as his vices. In life Johnny Cash struggled for and against the God whose grip on him was so frustratingly and thankfully relentless that it was able to absorb all that fierce rage and all those addictions. Johnny could sing about murder and God in the same song and with the same voice because to do otherwise would have been dishonest. At the same time, he let that despair, agony, and rejection stand on their own-he lent them integrity. There was no serious salvation unless there was first some serious sin. Cash echoed St. Paul: \\"It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.\\" But there is at least one thing that Cash never was, and that is a moralist. He did not chalk doubt up to a misunderstanding. Rather, Cash showed that doubt is itself proper to faith.

His spirit was scarred, busted, threadbare, but fearless, peaceable, witty and wise.

B000EMGAOY|1.0|When I heard the Peppers were recording with Rick Rubin once again I held out some hopes for a more rock/funk oriented Peppers.  Sadly mistaken once again, about 23 songs to put you to sleep with and a few that almost rock.  If you were hoping for a Blood Sugar or Mother's Milk vibe don't buy this.  If you liked there last ballad filled album this is for you.  I am done with the Chili Peppers, what once was my favorite band has now become music to fall asleep too.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|When I opened the box and saw what I was getting for $39.99 I almost fainted. What a box of junk I thought. The plastic is so fragile. First I had to put the thing together.

I really had to work hard to get it on and not to BREAK the fragile plastic on it.  <br /> <br />The dirt collector is small. When I went through the house it seemed to work well on dust and dirt. When I went to dump it the bottom was dirty and dusty, not just the actual dirt catcher. This device is just for quick use to get up dirt and cat litter and whatever else. It does not work good on my carpet though. It seems to try to work too hard.  <br /> <br />Now I don't really hate the product because it did do the job I inteded it to do. But I had to return it simply because the product is worth $10.00 max. It's a cheaply made product. A total rip off at $40 bucks. I just don't understand how these As Seen On TV companies continue to rip off the US population. We must stop buying their products until they start to bring prices to a proper range and end there \\"Get This Free\\" (just add shipping) campaign. I recently saw an add on TV for a product that added a free item and wanted to charge $8.99 to ship the free item along with the shipping for the regular item. The total shipping ended up being $17.99 for 2 items. Please people boycott those As Seen On TV products that force extra postage for free items.  <br />(sorry, had to get that off my chest ;-}
B000EMGAOY|5.0|[...]  yeahyeah, personally they're just sooooooo easy to hate and I'd never wanna hang out with them, but damn if john, flea and chad aren't getting tighter and tighter with each release..  john returning to the group was the best thing that could have ever happened to them--(remember the dave navarro guitar-ed turd one hot minute?!) and with  this his 3rd recorded album since rejoining, (5th overall) the group just really shines.  his playing is just so good! the screamy, stabby f-you of a solo on \\"torture me\\", the trademark dry as a saltine funk muting scratch of \\"hump de bump\\" and the hendrix ape-ing/tributing of \\"purple haze\\" on \\"dani california\\", and the machine gun arpegiatting of \\"snow (hey oh)\\" and the screaming soaring speeding stuff on \\"so much i\\"..I could go on and on.   john is this record's MVP, hands down.   according to a magazine article I read a few years back, supposedly all he does in his spare time [...] is yoga and play guitar. it shows in his playing.  --him and flea work and weave together magically and frusciante's sparse, lean parts give flea and chad plenty of room to fill, which they do like the seasoned vets they are.  chad's drumming is pocket-perfect..and flea? please.  \\"21st century\\"?!!???  oh no.  john's guit burns.  but flea is just---bass monster.  yeahyeah--people dig claypool, but michael \\"flea\\" balzary wins.  he's my favorite bassist working and age has really broadened his playing. bass isn't what you play but what you DON'T play and flea's understanding of what to play and when and where and how much just gets better and better as years go by.  and it was great to hear the return of his trumpet playing..  anthony's singing is pretty much what you'd expect---but he really jumps (unapologetically) back to the rap/rock/whiteboyfunk/vocalizing of the groups earliest records.  and the rick rubin production just sounds rock.  neil diamond record aside, the guys production is gold and it's no wonder the chili's keep going to him forthe knob twiddles. he brings out their best.    musically the album is a lot edgier and funkier than some of their last releases--shades of uplift mofo even. \\"tell me baby\\"? funk and slap ala old skool flea, digging alla the old moves from \\"higher ground\\" out from the trunkafunk.  volume/content wise, think a tubbier blood sugar, with all of the high's and lows but all working to a greater good.   double albums (especially with the extra time of a cd's) are very hard to pull off (c'mon, how many double non-live studio records do you see these days from non-jam bands??! ) and the rhcp score here.   I really liked californication and by the way even more but this beats out them both--and that's a tall order for an album spread over 2 discs.    good stuff.   it's worth having.  I like it.    oh and the hamburger pimp from dolemite should claim \\"readymade\\" as his new theme....it'd fit.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It was a great year for music, but there's something about this album that puts it on a different level.  Absolution is not as original as the Scissor Sisters' debut nor as fun as Franz Ferdinand's first album, and it's not even as pretty as Keane's Hopes and Fears, but Absolution is in some ways the culmination of decades of rock experimentation.  In a flawlessly-produced album featuring roaring guitars and virtuosic piano, Bellamy and his mates riff about finding meaning in the world in the face of an upcoming end of it all. Each song pushes you a little closer to the edge, with the ominous Apocalpyse giving way to Time is Running Out, which (even though early) is the musical and emotional keystone of the album. The next few songs develop further the theme of this album, with Stockholm Syndrome and Hysteria as the highlights.  Much the way Yorke loved to do though, right when you think you've got Muse figured out they throw Butterflies & Hurricanes at you.  A reference to chaos theory (watch Jurassic Park if you need a refresher course), this  song offers the call to action that the album has been dancing around.  \\"You've got to be the best, you've got to change the world and use this chance to be heard. Your time is NOW\\" yells Bellamy over the pianos and violins before his Rachmaninov interlude takes over.  The rest of the album is beautiful, though after Butterflies nearly any song would be a waste of time.  This might very well be the most important rock album to hit the shelves since the turn of the century.  Think the best of Radiohead and Queen with the best of past and future Muse (Muscle Museum, Fillip, Newborn, Feeling Good...), and combine that with the thematic powerhouse of the end of the world, and you have what might be the most important rock album since the turn of the millenium.
B000002572|5.0|I burned this same CD and this is amazing music. Every single song is still being played on the radio in 2006, 29 years later. This has to be one of the top 10 rock albums ever produced.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|This album has had some bad press. But compare it to the shoddy 'work' of some of the manufactured pop rubbish there is around, and it is a classic. You wouldn't find such musicality, such diversity in the tracks, such feeling and such damn solid beats on their albums. I love it. <br /> <br />Although they pretty much all appeal to me, two stand-out tracks are 'Juicebox' and 'Heart In A Cage'. They both most notably contain that low, heavy bass which gives the song texture and and that old-school feel. The latter is my favourite song at the moment and I can listen to it without becoming tired of it several times over, straight after one another; once doesn't seem to be enough. It makes you want to sing, cry, sleep, smile, dance and lie on the floor all at the time. Anything that does that to you surely deserves some credit. <br /> <br />I think it is something of an acquired taste and varies somewhat from what we know and love of the Strokes from the 'Is This It' days. But their music has just matured and they don't seem afraid to make a new and original sound, in a musical world where new bands are sculpted and blinkered into thinking that they must go the 'Kelly Clarkson' and 'Shane Ward' way, or no way at all. There is different music out there, and we shouldn't limit ourselves to what the masses tell us we should listen to. <br /> <br />Yeah.. so, like, I liked it. Innit. <br /> <br />

B000EULJLU|5.0|Like many others, I was definitely disappointed on my first couple of listens.  It seemed disjointed, awkwardly and randomly developed, and lacking in compelling pay-off climaxes.  But then again, I initially felt this way about all previous Tool songs not named \\"Sober.\\"  On repeated listens, when I became more familiar with where they were headed in each song, I then became able to appreciate the subtle movements that develop along the way.  Now, the entire album has come together for me and I am both thrilled and relieved (it would have killed me if Tool came out with a dud).      \\"Vicarious\\" is a very catchy song with a cool guitar riff and is infused with a bright energy (as opposed to being moody and dark).  \\"Jambi\\" starts with a machine gun guitar attack but then Maynard goes through several nice melodies, and then in the middle, there is a breakout rhythm jam session by the drums and bass guitar.  The \\"Wings\\" suite is extremely moody and solemn with brief, loud climaxes.  The barely connected interaction between the low, elegiac singing and the elegant guitar progression which finishes each part is particularly interesting.  \\"The Pot\\" has surprising high-pitched jazzy (or is it Eastern-style?) vocals which blend precisely into an otherwise straight-up hard-rocking song.  Though annoying at first, this is really a welcome addition to Maynard's singing repertoire.  \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" is a quick, soft segue.  \\"Lost Keys\\" has a bright guitar progression and includes a conversation between a doctor and nurse, which then leads into \\"Rosetta Stoned.\\"  This one was the hardest to swallow at first.  I realized after a while, that much of the song is taken from pieces of \\"Third Eye\\"--they both have repetitive industrial noise/yelling, they have some of the same guitar riffs, and both have sweet melodies hidden within.  After realizing this, this 11 minute song has become very nice to listen to.  \\"Intension\\" is a beautiful, almost-acoustic guitar piece with an almost Lane Staley-like chanting by Maynard.  This segues into \\"Right in Two,\\" a bright, melodious song with sweet guitar picking, a loud instrumental break in the middle, and then a modest but fulfilling climax at the end.      Musically, as described repeatedly above, this album is brighter and more melodious than any previous Tool album.  It's like if you took a lot of Lateralus's structures, added snippets of Aenima, and then combined them with the brighter and catchy sounds of the first two APC albums, then you'd have \\"10,000 Days.\\"  The progression here, then, is not to become more experimental (as Aenima did by fusing the epic metal format with jazz, industrial, and Eastern music; and Lateralus did by establishing cold, hard, \\"logic-based\\" song structures and complex time-signatures and time-signature changes, along with tribal-influenced drumming), but instead to infuse APC's brighter and catchier sounds into what Tool has already accomplished.  Some may be disappointed with this development, but it has been a breath of fresh air to me.  Unlike any of their previous albums, which I can only fully enjoy when it is nighttime and I am feeling really moody, I can actually enjoy this album during daylight hours while driving around or at work or running errands.    Lyrically, Maynard has again moved forward.  Undertow was mostly about venting frustration and angst due to the difficult circumstances the \\"speaker\\" had been facing while growing up.  Aenima was about the \\"speaker's\\" delving into an understanding of the psychology underlying all his pain and anger.  Lateralus dealt with more abstract philosophies on how to live better and appreciate life more.  Finally, 10,000 Days is about trying to grasp and come to terms with the immense implications of being surrounded by long-suffering and, finally, death.  With each album, the \\"speaker\\" has explored, discovered, and matured, and the subject matter and the tone of the lyrics is a reflection of this maturation process.  These albums are like a documentation of 16 years of a man's observations, introspection, and conclusions.    The biggest flaws in this album for me are that too many previous Tool ideas have been identically repeated throughout this album, some guitar solos are a little too uninspiring (though I loved the solo in \\"Jambi\\"), and some of the songs (\\"Jambi\\" and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\") could have ended better or more interestingly.  But when you are in the business of making only epic-length songs, these problems are bound to happen.  Otherwise, the new material is brilliant and fresh.    Finally, I believe that the greatest thing about Tool is their ability to create complete and thoroughly thought-out albums, each of which immerses the listener inside an exhilarating and heart-wrenching world, and then to evolve and mature compellingly with each album.  10,000 Days, then, is an appropriate next step and is executed brilliantly.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|It might be that I'm a purist, but I felt that there were a lot of things about this adaptation that were just WRONG. When I first saw it, I was determined to give it a fair chance- I came in knowing that there was probably a lot that they would have to cut out so that it would not be 5 or 6 hours long, but I did not expect some of the strange things that they added instead. <br /> Elizabeth Bennet just didn't seem right to me- she didn't have nearly as much sweetness as was needed to balance out her \\"archness\\". To me, she came off not so much clever and lively as having a 21st century bad attitude.  <br />As for Darcy, I was happy that he was a little more sympathetic than he had been portrayed as in the A&E version, but they also took out so much of his arrogance and pride that it makes you wonder why he was so universally disliked in the first place! Besides this, the second proposal and the final \\"goddess divine\\" scene seemed like it was taken straight out of some cheap Romance novel. <br />However, so that I do not seem so incredibly negative, I might also mention that there were some things that I did like quite a lot. The music and the cinematography was beautiful, and some of the secondary characters were just about right- Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine especially, barring the odd scene when Lady C. comes to the Bennets' house in the middle of the night. <br /> <br />All in all, it was a pretty good movie- it just wasn't Austen.
B00007KWHG|5.0|i thought is was great, i got home and listened to the CD for hours, the music is great music from, that film  THE WANDERERS
B00005RFAI|4.0|I bought Pink's first CD years ago and wasn't impressed but with one song. (I hate when that happens) so I haven't been in a rush to run out and purchase more material from her.  But then I heard Dear Mr. President and ran out and bought I'm not dead.  Absolutely wonderful CD.  So I decided to backtrack and buy her popular missundaztood.  This is a good CD with the title track, don't let me get me, just like a pill, get the party started, and lastly, family portait making this purchase well worth the money.  If you skipped over this CD, you're doing yourself a disservice.
B000EPR7NE|4.0|Snatched this album from Itunes  on release date. Even before I listened to it, I noticed the track titles which to be seemed really interesting! I wrote a small blog on it. If you wanna check it out[...], Movies section.<br />Now to the music. I am re listening to it for the third time and even if nothing stands out as a theme, overall it's perfect background for the novel and the story. And that is what a soundtrack should be in the first place. The tone is somber but also mystical and almost sacred. Strings are a perfect choice and Hans Zimmer does a wonderful job overall! Each track has a spirif of its own. 13 tracks appear in the film and each is a step towards enlightment. Enjoy :)
B000EULJLU|5.0|Well, i read some of the waffle written both before this album was released and since.  As a result i wasn't sure what to expect and it has been with a mixture of fear and anticipation that i have been waiting for my copy to be delivered.   <br /> <br />Now, i am not a Tool fanatic, but i do believe that Aenima is probably the greatest rock/metal album i have ever heard.   <br /> <br />So, when 10,000 days arrived in my post box this morning i was preparing myself for disappointment, given some of the less than flattering reviews, and having to match up to previous greatness. <br /> <br />All i have to say is this:  It's brilliant
B00005K9LM|3.0|This album came out in 1984 when Metallica was more popular. Some of the songs on the album are a bit commercial but the twin guitar attack does not disappoint. I think it interesting that Judas Priest didn't really score any hits after the 80's. It is still good meat and potatoes metal.
1400032717|5.0|This book was a fantastic, though strange read.  Seeing the world through a savant's eyes is fascinating, especially since the wording was done so well.  The story is all about change and the disruption change causes.  But, there is a lesson to be learned from the saying \\"going with the flow\\" :P  All-in-all, a touching, sweet, scary, sad, confused, exciting, story of a boy with a special affinity for numbers and getting into trouble.

B00005A46T|5.0|I have long since passed the mainstream metal genre but this is BY FAR the best Slipknot album.  Definitely the hardest one out.  I mostly listen to 6 Feet Under, Cryptopsy, etc...but this, this is good.  My only complaint is that there is more rap-metal style in here than I would like.  Other than that, this is a great album.  And for you aftermarket car audio people, Joey Jordison really goes wild with his drumming in this one.  Enjoy.
B000EULJLU|5.0|An alternate title for this review could well be, Tool:  Slowest tempoed Progressive band ever!  If you didn't catch onto the progressive vibe on Lateralis, you surely can't miss it on 10,000 Days.  However, instead of the speedy spiraling tempoes usually found in progressive rock, Tool puts forth slow and undulating tribal rythms dished out at thunderous pace. <br />From the album packaging and artwork to the music itself, Tool is everything a great rock album should be:  Thought provoking, groundbreaking, sonicly pleasing, and intense.  10,000 Days is all of this, full tilt. <br />This album at first listen seems like the logical progression from Lateralis, with the slow burning \\"Vicarious\\".  However, just as Lateralis proved to be a huge leap forward from the AEnima album, so does 10,000 Days take us into new soundscapes and territories as well as some old, long since abandoned places, in subsiquent tracks.  Track two, \\"Jambi\\", keeps the hard rock proginy on course showcasing why Danny Carey is one of the greatest drummers of this age.  Next we delve into new ambient territory with \\"Wings for Marie\\" and \\"10,000 Days\\" both very slow and light tracks that put one in a trance like state and really take you to a place that Tool is all about:  Expanding your mind!  Track fives, \\"The Pot\\" is an instant Tool classic showcasing all band members in top form.  The vocals, riffs, and bassline pull you along and it's just impossible to not get up for this song.  It harkens \\"Sober\\" and \\"Aenima\\" wrapped up into 6 minutes and 21 seconds of pure rock bliss.   <br />The interlude of the album comes in the tribal \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" and the ambient \\"Lost Keys\\".  Track 8 brings us back to where \\"The Pot\\" left off.  \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" is classic Tool from start to finish some 11 minutes later.  Next we get more of the softer side of Tool in \\"Intension\\" and then the albums true crescendo in \\"Right in Two\\" a rock masterpiece.  The album closes with the most ambient track in the entire tool catalogue, \\"Viginti Tres\\".  <br />Take your favorite mind expanding drug and delve into 10,000 Days.  Listen after listen brings at once something new and a great appreciation for holding this beatiful work of art in your collection.  Rock on!
B0000025BL|5.0|forget sgt pepper, this is the greatest fukin record ever made. it pushes music beyond its limits. it will never be topped.
B000063DFN|5.0|I think the genious of this album is lost on the fact that its heavy metal.  Rime of the Ancient Mariner, based on a poem written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, is simply brilliant.  Bruce Dickenson's singing is so powerful, convincing, full of depth and thoughtfulness that its hard to classify as simply music.  The rest of the songs are also very strong, especially Powerslave, as a wole I have to think this is my favorite Maiden album.  To classify Powerslave with any metal thats come out in the last 20 years should be a crime.  Like a bell curve that reached its peak in 1986, the music industry has taken a steady nose dive after this Powerslave release and has never recovered, mainly because the musicianship, intelligence, creativity and guts are simply not there,  the way they are on Powerslave.  Moreover greed controls people and suffocates any hope of creativity, unlike Maiden albums of the early years.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Nirvana are the most overrated band in history, and this compilation proves they were nothing but a one hit wonder. I said it once and here it is again..... <br /> <br />It's quite unbelievable how overrated Nirvana are, there is no other band in history that are regard so highly with so little work to show for it. Rolling Stone and other music magazine continue to eat up the rubbish Cobain and co. created, simply because they needed something new after the 80's to sell their publications. I admit that I own a lot of Nirvana's work, but I accept it for what it really is, watered down heavy metal with no lyrical or musical depth.  <br /> <br />Where do your start with Nirvana's short coming. First of all they were presented as some kind of saviours of rock, who had come to save us from hair metal. A band that would bring content, along with heavy riffs. The truth is, Nirvana are a one hit wonder, they never really reached the standards smell like teen spirit set. People will always argue about the many classic on 'In Utero' or 'Unplugged in New York', but they really were just one hit wonders. Further more that one hit was a based on a riff stolen from Boston's 'More than a felling'. The fact is Nirvana and Kurt Cobain specially, are nothing but rip-off artists, the only difference between them and Oasis is that Oasis admitted they ripped off other bands. Nirvana stole riffs and ideas from everybody, Boston, Killing Joke, Mudhoney, Sonic Youth, and Meat Puppets. You name it, they stole it.  <br /> <br />That brings me to the so called musical greatness that is Kurt Cobain, the biggest hack in history. I've seen Rolling Stone put him in there greatest song writers of all time and guitarists. Please the guy's songs were dull and repetitive and drug nightmares, even then he could not pull that off with the half ass class of Alice in Chains. His guitar work was awful. All his decent riffs were ripped off from other bands. His also an unbelievable hypocrite. He states that Pearl Jam are sell outs, but Nirvana were signed to Geffen and practically brought grunge to suburbia. He also appears on the cover of Bliss magazine and continues doe interviews for MTV, playing their poster boy for grunge. Who's the real sell out? He was so upset with becoming successful, why didn't he stop making videos and stop releasing singles like Pearl Jam. The truth is Kurt Cobain had no real talent, he stole a riff off Bosten and made a fortune, and when it was time for a follow, he could not cut it, so took the easy route and took his life, so people will forever go one about what he could have achieved. They guy is a hack and if he was still alive now, he still be a one hit wonder.  <br />

B000F1IQN2|5.0|Speilberg surprised me with this.  It is a truly open-minded story based on the aftermath of the Munich Olympic massacre in 1972.  It would have been easy to villainize the Palestinians for this act.  And they certainly would have earned it for what they did.  But Speilberg uses the atrocity to illustrate that there are in fact legitimate and understandable issues on both sides.  And only when we really look at that can we move toward peace. Politics aside though is it a great film on it's own?  Yes!  Especially if you like femme fatales- that Dutch assasin- wow!  I would have said f-it and let her bribe me into not killing her.  This is a great action-adventure/drama with some great comedic bits thrown in as well.  I am not going to spoil it by recapping the storyline.  Just see it.

038572179X|5.0|Ian McEwan is one of the most highly-regarded novelists working today, and with damn good reason. Atonement is an outstanding novel. It is the story of one day in the life of 13 year old Briony Tallis, and the terrible crime she commits, and her eventual attempt at \\"atonement\\". Briony is an aspiring writer (and, we are aware from the start, she will eventually be a very highly regarded novelist), and she is planning to present a play for her beloved older brother Leon, visiting from London, on this day in 1935. The first half of the book presents the events of that day through the intertwined perceptions of several people: Briony; her older sister Cecilia, who has just finished at Cambridge; their charlady's son, Robbie, who has also finished at Cambridge and will be trying for medical school (sponsored by Mr. Tallis); and Briony's mother Emily Tallis, an invalid whose husband stays away and is clearly cheating on her. The other key characters are the Quinceys: 15 year old Lola and 9 year old twin boys Jackson and Pierrot, who have come to stay with the Tallises while their parents (Emily's sister and her husband) go through a divorce.  <br /> <br />Briony recruits her cousins to act in her play but they seem ready to ruin it. Robbie and Cecilia, long friends from having grown up together, begin to discover a deeper attraction. The amiable Leon shows up with his crude and rich friend Paul Marshall. Dinner ends suddenly with the young boys running away, and a terrible event while searching for them is compounded by Briony's \\"crime\\", which I won't reveal but is truly wrenching, truly a \\"crime\\", but in a way understandable.  <br /> <br />The novel then jumps forward 5 years to the beginning of the War, specifically the retreat from Dunkirk, and the effects of Briony's crime are revealed. Briony herself begins to try to atone ... Finally, in 1999 the aging Briony, a lionized novelist, reflects on her secrets, and on her final attempt at atonement.  <br /> <br />It's really excellent stuff -- terribly wrenching, also sweetly moving, quite exciting. The view of the events at Dunkirk is a very effective. Briony, Robbie, and Cecilia are captured with exactness and honesty. The prose is very fine, very balanced and elegant. The real thing.  <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|After listening for a week, I must say, this is my favorite tool album. Everytime I hear a song it feels like the first time in a way...
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a fascinating novel, both technically adept and interesting (rather a tour-de-force, indeed) and emotionally involving. It was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in the UK, and indeed was the betting favorite, though it did not win. I thought it quite wonderful -- I would say teetering on the edge of greatness but falling just short.  <br /> <br />It opens with a section called \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\". This is about an American travelling in the South Seas in about 1850. This stops abruptly, and the novel continues with \\"Letters from Zedelghem\\", about a bisexual Englishman, Robert Frobisher, a composer, who flees to Belgium to escape creditors, and inveigles his way to a job with the great composer Vyvyan Ayrs. Frobisher's letters are to his lover, physicist Rupert Sixsmith: and the next section, \\"Half Lives: the First Luisa Rey Mystery\\", purports to be a thriller, in which journalist Luisa Rey meets the aging Rupert Sixsmith, who has written a suppressed report concerning the flaws in the design of a new nuclear reactor. This \\"novel\\" stops literally with Luisa in midair, and we jump to \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\", in which Cavendish, a vanity press publisher, lucks into a bestselling mobster's memoir, only to run into trouble when his family demands a cut, by force. Cavendish flees but somehow is committed to a strange geriatric home. But before we learn how his story comes out, we proceed to \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451\\", set in a future Korea, in which Sonmi-451, a \\"fabricant\\", one of many enslaved by the Unanimity government, dictates her memories to an archivist before her execution. Finally, the center of the novel is taken up with \\"Sloosha's Crossin' and Ev'rythin' After\\", in which Zachry, a resident of Hawaii after technological civilization has collapsed, part of a bucolic society that worships Sonmi, tells of the visit of a \\"Prescient\\" woman (from an island which has managed to retain some technological knowledge), andthe terrible changes coming to his people. From there the novel cascades down through the first five sections in reverse order, completing each half-finished narrative. There are cunning links between each section, and an overall thematic pattern.  <br /> <br />As I said, I liked it a great deal. The main weakness is some plot missteps, particularly in the Luisa Rey and Sonmi-451 segments. The middle section drags a bit (and it is written in a dialect that is well done but that makes reading a bit difficult), and the first/last section (the Adam Ewing stuff) is also less involving than the rest. The SFnal ideas are not precisely new, but they are well-handled, particularly the Sonmi-451 stuff, especially the revelations of Sonmi-451's nature (which does have some nice original touches).  <br /> <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This album really deserves 4 stars for the music, but these guys are the real deal and deserve 5 stars.  I was excited a month ago to be able to buy records by Pearl Jam, Neil Young, and the Chili Peppers all within a couple weeks of each other.  Neil Young delivered like always.  The Chili Peppers album was a big stinky fart of a record.  The Pearl Jam album rocked way more than I expected.   <br /> <br />These guys are honest and just write good songs.  I'd like to hear some of the riffs be a tad more focused...yes I'd like to see Eddie lose the guitar and let the other two handle it.  Two guitars is more than enough.  This is a solid record from beginning to end-go buy it!
B000F1IQNM|4.0|Stellar British actors are gathered for the production of `Nanny McPhee,' British family picture, which includes Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Kelly McDonald, Imelda Staunton, Derek Jacobi, and Angela Lansbury. The director is Kirk Jones, who did a wicked comedy `Waking Ned Divine' back in 1998, set in a small Irish village where small lies beget another bigger lies. In 'Nanny McPhee' it is small magic by the newly arrived governess in black that rehabilitate the troubled relations between the kids and their father. But this happens only after several `close calls' that provide us with darkly funny moments. <br /> <br />For `Nanny McPhee' Emma Thompson wrote the script based on the children's book by Christina Brand `Nurse Matilda,' and herself stars as the `nanny' with one big protruding front tooth. She arrives at the door of one Mr. Brown (Colin Firth), with a magic walking cane with which she casts a spell on the unruly motherless children who had been so good at making the life of the previous governesses very miserable.  <br /> <br />But Nanny McPhee is no ordinary governess, with her magic which is totally different from Mary Poppins.' Kids may act very rudely, even try to deceive Nanny McPhee, but she only lets them face the consequences of their bad behaviors. The story may sound preachy and humorless (and some may find it so), but thanks to the credible interactions between Emma Thompson and the seven children, especially Thomas Sangster, the film's main story is always involving. <br /> <br />The film has a sub-plot about the hasty plans of Mr. Brown and his remarriage. Mr. Brown reluctantly decides on marrying again, because his stern and aristocratic aunt (Angela Lansbury) orders him to do so within a month. Every piece is put in the right place at the end of the story (including the unrequited love of illiterate but sweet maid Evangeline played by very sweet Kelly McDonald), but things look a little too good and predictable, with more obvious slapsticksand less darker implications. <br /> <br />Forget about the dancing donkey and that kind of silly things in `Nanny McPhee.' The magic works in this film, but not that way. In `Nanny McPhee,' the magic is there to sort out the troubles in Mr. Brown's house, making the kids well-behaved and, more importantly, wiser. Its world is soaked in brilliant colors - interior of the room, the costume, and so on - and Nanny McPhee, always dressed in black, remains the same, giving the driest wit and humor. I love the film for this dry wit and humor, quintessentially British. <br />
B000DWMN2S|2.0|I know that everyone who has read the book says the same thing: the novel is SO much better than the movie.  I have read the book.  I agree with these people.<br /><br />Jonathan Safran Foer's 'Everything Is Illuminated' is, in my mind, a masterpiece.  Although he doesn't follow what most would call a traditional writing style, his story is told in a way that draws the reader in and gives them no other choice than to FEEL.  At some points humorous and silly, extremely serious and sad, and at other times just plain weird, Foer's novel was a work of art.<br /><br />The film, to me, did not even make sense.  The fact that I entered the theater with the story already in mind probably kept me from understanding the extreme changes that were made in the film adaptation, but even so, these were changes that did not need to be made.  The very climax of the book, as far as I could tell, was completely REMOVED from the film!  I may have just missed something (to be fair, I did only see the film once), but I'm pretty sure that the most crucial part of the story was GONE!<br /><br />That really upset me.  I saw the film with my dad.  He loved it.  I asked him to explain the resolution to me.  He couldn't.  He never read the book.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was, for the most part, accurate and enjoyable.  The second half, not so much.  The entire piece, though, had a beautiful &lt;em>appearance&lt;/em>.  The actors who filled the roles of Alex and his grandfather were remarkable!  And if the story only weren't so different from that of the book, I most likely would have loved the film, as it was headed in a good direction.<br /><br />Overall, it was a major disappointment, and I wouldn't feel right giving it any more than two stars.
B00006878K|5.0|Albert absolutely wails on both guitar and vocals. Not a single moment is wasted, though the opportunity to waste moments isn't really allowed. The album, especially Albert's playing, is truly breathtaking and thus the only complaint is, as another reviewer said, that they fade the tracks out right when it sounds like Albert is heating up. Still, this album is very highly recommended and it's influence on rockers/blues-rockers can be heard more clearly than that of nearly any other blues album. If you are familiar with Cream's seminal Disraeli Gears, then you will especially enjoy this, as Clapton's work on that album is heavily inspired by this album.
B0000541AM|4.0|I remember watching this as a teenager and now in my 40-somethings, I still enjoyed it as much as the first time. <br />The Director's Cut is just fine and does not deter any from the original.  Even though the dialog is a bit dated -- do people still say \\"Can you dig it?\\" -- its still a good addition to your collection - A classic!
B000286S8S|3.0|Well, well, well. After listening to this album all the way through for the first time since I bought it, I had to ask myself the question, \\"Why?\\". Yes, Van Halen's latest addition to their discography does nothing to encourage any young and coming fans, who may want to go on and by more Van Halen albums. Personally, I've never enjoyed the Sammy Hagar years, and I've constantly found that the years, though drastically shortened, with David Lee Roth have done more to make me want to continue basking in the glow that is Van Halen. If you're in the same boat as I am, BEWARE!!! This album takes the route of focusing more on Hagar, and less on Roth. Yes, \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" really isn't. The album, opens up with \\"Eruption\\", causing you to foolishly believe that you've just purchased a maginifcent album....but then come the next three tracks, \\"Learning To See\\", \\"Up For Breakfast\\" and \\"It's About Time\\", which are the newest songs to be inserted into the VH Catalogue. Now, yes, admittedly, ANY greatest hits album that has been recently issued by a still-surviving group must have the new stuff(case in point, observe The Who's \\"Then And Now\\", which features two new tracks: \\"Old Red Wine\\", and \\"Real Good Looking Boy\\"), however, the real problem persists in the four more Hagar tunes then there are Roth tunes. The only two Hagar hits that I've ever enjoyed appear on this album(\\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\", and \\"Right Now\\"), which merits one star in and of itself. The other two stars that I've awarded go to the fact that you've got a great selection of David-Lee-Roth-era hits on here, however, you have to swim like hell through the river of despondency that is Sammy-Hagar-era VH in order to land ashore on the bountiful land of \\"VH + David Lee Roth='HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!!'\\" Now, I'm sure by reading this, some hardcore VH fans will be instantly plotting for my inevitable defeat, but hear me out. I have nothing against Sammy Hagar himself(personally, I've always enjoyed hearing \\"I Can't Drive 55\\"), I just adamantly believe that when Sammy Hagar joined the group, they lost that edge that they had over all other groups when Roth was a part of them, and this, so-called \\"Greatest Hits Collection\\" is living proof of the aforementioned statement.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Well the title is pretty self explanitory but I'll throw in my input for those who are seeking advice and is present to the musical question: \\"Should I buy this CD?\\" If you are seeking a mezmerizing catchy CD and what I consider to be Red Hot Chili Pepper's GREATEST WORK to date then go for it. I look at it this way, if you don't enjoy this CD then you simply dont enjoy Red Hot Chili Peppers PERIOD. I've seen some reviews pointing negatively towards Stadium Arcadium and wondered how the heck these people even like Red Hot Chili Peppers in the first place, how can you enjoy a band and not even like their best album? I don't believe I came across a single track on Stadium Arcadium that I disliked even the slightest bit, as said in the title the songs are euphoric and carry a strange \\"space like\\" feel to them (hence the CD names Jupiter and Mars). Plus these guys are even nice enough to send us not one but two CDs, totaling 28 new songs and a booklet containing the lyrics, now if that is not fan friendly then I don't know what is. So for those who ask themselves \\"Is it worth it?\\", the answer is simple: Totally and utterly worth it. Happy listening, and for you Red Hot's, bravo.

B000EULJLU|4.0|I wish it didn't take so long between Tool albums.  But because it does take so long, the standards they're held to are much higher than bands that release albums every couple years.  Such is the case with their latest studio effor 10,000 Days.  After the near genius of Lateralus it's almost a given that they weren't going to easily top that recording.  Just like with the stock market, the quality can't just keep improving forever without some type of reset.  And I think that is the issue with this recording.  As another reviewer pointed out, this recording sounds like the bridge between Aenima and Lateralus rather than the successor to Lateralus.   <br /> <br />While 10,000 Days is not a bad album by any stretch; it just doesn't build upon or even approach the promise set by Lateralus.  There are flashes of brilliance like with Vicarious and 10,000 Days among the missteps like Intension or the backward steps like The Pot.  I guess as a band you've made your mark in the world of music when you can put out a recording that is better than just about anyone else in a genre and still be criticized for coming up short.  At least the band scores bonus points for one of the coolest cd packages I've ever seen. <br /> <br />While I'm a huge Tool fan and have about 20 assorted live performances; I'm also not a fanboy.  For me to give a 5 star rating I have to think that a recording is genre defining.  I felt that way with Lateralus, but I don't fee that way about 10,000 Days.  There's just too much lost and or unrealized potential for me to go that high.  Tool has shown remarkable progress from the Opiate days till Lateralus.  So if the band keeps putting out material in the future, we'll most likely evaluate this album as a speed bump on the highway of musical immortality.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is the best I've heard from them, the best I've heard from anyone in a long long time. However good you think it will be, it'll be better. Many instant classics, and since no one seems to have endorsed this song yet I'm gonna have to remind everyone of the amazing \\"Slow Cheetah.\\"  <br />They go back to some of their old roots in some of their songs, but they've made it sound a thousand times better. And a lot of songs are innovative in a way that will blow your mind. BUY THE ALBUM... twice.
B00002EPJH|5.0|In a world with so much noise and clamor it is a pleasure to listen to this album. The set is so wonderfully put together and it shows the love for the ballad. K.J. has demonstrated that music does not have to be a constant flurry of notes and tempo to hit the mark. For those who complain about the sound quality of the recording I would suggest for this once, they listen with their hearts instead of their ears, with this perspective they will appreciate the music even more.
0747263744|5.0|Some fantasies are impossible to classify, and are almost impossible to review.  \\"American Gods\\" is one of them.  Zelazny's \\"Lord of Light\\" is a story of a 'gods versus gods' war, and so is this book.  But in Gaiman's book, everyone is either a god, an unusually decent American, a serial killer disguised as a decent American, or a wife who returns from the dead.  The only gods who don't show up are Big J and his only begotten Son.  My favorite characters are the Egyptian deities who run a funeral home in Cairo---that's Illinois, not Egypt, even though one of them likes to snack off bits of organ meat from his customers.<br /><br />All the way through \\"American Gods\\" I kept asking myself, 'what could possibly be a happy ending for this book?'  All gods require believers and sacrifice in order to exist.  The gods we imported to America with us are hungry, cranky, and old.  The new gods (one is thinly disguised as Bill Gates) are afraid that their life-spans are going to be very short.  Who still believes in the railroad god?<br /><br />Gods die, the very old ones who lose all of their followers.  Why does Gaiman include their stories?  Well, it certainly lends to the dark atmospherics of his book.  I think he also wanted to show how these gods and their worshippers came to this land:  some as traders; some in chains; some as warriors and hunters.  Here, he says, here is how we ended up elbow-to-elbow with Odin and Ibis-headed gods, gods of the internet, and gods of the land.  No wonder Armageddon is inevitable.<br /><br />Or is it?  Can an ex-con named Shadow, his dead wife, and some of his very odd friends stave off the final confrontation?  Follow Gaiman to an eerie motel in the navel of America and celebrate (or mourn) the twilight of at least one god.  Follow him to San Francisco and witness the violent demise of the Queen of Sheba.  With this book, Gaiman has turned himself into the William Least Heat Moon of America's fantasy highways.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is their best work, and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br />This is their deepest, hardest, most emotive and well they still show they are funky monks! <br /> <br />There are tracks on this album that seem like it was straight off BSSM as well as some from later albums such as Californication or BTW. They have really DAMN good ballads as well as funk numbers that will get you dancing. The guitar solos on this album are the best yet from John F. and you can expect the live versions to be even better than they already are. This band has gone through alot and this is their music at their most mature period. I hope they continue like this. They know what they're doing. Hail the funky monks! <br /> <br />And I'm sorry I can't choose one song from the album to talk about. Simply because every single song is bloody brilliant!  <br /> <br />(gosh the solo in turn it again is killer!)
B0009OU22I|4.0|The 1977 film \\"MacArthur\\" is well aware that there were two sides to the controversial military leader General Douglas MacArthur, and you can almost see the makers of this film flipping a coin to decide which side Gregory Peck gets to show in the next scene. On the one hand there was the brilliant military strategist and leader who directed Allied forces in the Pacific against the Japanese in World War II and for the first half of the Koran War. On the other hand that was the vain and egotistical man who selected official photographs with as much care as he plained invasions and attacks. Most of the credit in this film goes to Peck's performance in making these two diverse sides fit together for the most part.<br /><br />The contrast between the two is probably best captured in two scenes involving Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright (Sandy Kenyon), who was left behind in command of the Philippines when FDR ordered MacArthur to get to safety in Australia. Even though he promises MacArthur he \\"will be here or I'll be dead,\\" Wainwright is ultimately forced to surrender and MacArthur goes off the deep end, insisting that Wainwright has gone insane and heaping invective on the man's name. Later in the film, on the day the Japanese signed the articles of surrender on the U.S.S. \\"Missouri,\\" Wainwright arrives, a gaunt figure after years of captivity in a Japanese prison. MacArthur embraces Wainwright warmly, brushing away all apologies and assuring the man he can have his Corps back as soon as he says the word. MacArthur remains the same man, unconcerned by the obvious contradictions of his nature.<br /><br />Director Joseph Sargent frames this biopic with MacArthur's famous speech to the cadets of West Point, where he extols the virtues of \\"Duty,\\" \\"Honor,\\" \\"Country.\\" Beyond a brief look back at his early life and military career, the story of the film begins with the general and his besieged forces in the Philippines. But throughout the film we are supposed to hear those words \\"Duty,\\" \\"Honor,\\" \\"Country\\" resonating. MacArthur is forced to leave the Philippines, but he vows to return, and he does. The UN forces are almost forced off the Korean peninsula, but MacArthur retakes it all before the Chinese get involved. MacArthur is able to force FDR to go with his plans, but finds Harry Truman unwilling to go along, thereby ending a distinguished military career of over half-a-century.<br /><br />Which sides comes out ahead? The ways Sargent tries to balance the two sides gets pretty interesting. Both Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) and Truman (Ed Flanders) have their pokes at MacArthur, while it is a pair of his Japanese adversaries who speak to his military ability (scenes that are reminiscent of the Germans doing the same thing in \\"Patton\\"). The Presidents give the general credit for his military endeavors, but those accolades are buried beneath the verbal ripostes; on the political side the rebuttal comes from actual film footage of Republican Senators (e.g., Nixon of California) supporting MacArthur and blasting Truman. Even stranger, MacArthur's aides are forced to play it both ways. On the one hand they are doing everything they can for the general's public relations, but then there are also times when they basically roll their eyes at what is coming out of MacArthur's mouth.<br /><br />In the end, MacArthur is not only redeemed by Peck's performance, but by having the final two scenes of the film be the famous pair of speeches MacArthur delivered when he returned to the United States. The first was the \\"The Old Soldiers\\" speech given to the Joint Session of Congress and the other the speech to the cadets. When you have a character who has been saying some pretty stupid things from time to time throughout the film and then allow him to reach such flights of oratorical elegance, it is hard not to end on his side of the ledger. \\"MacArthur\\" is not enough to allow anyone to make a reasoned judgment on the man and his career, but it shouldbe enough to inspire those who are interested to go read some books that can provide you better evidence for really making up your mind.t it should be enough to inspire those who are interested to go read some books that can provide you better evidence for really making up your mind.
1400079179|1.0|Silly Book #2<br /><br />Okay, I admit it, I'm the last person in the Northern Hemisphere - except for a pocket of Zapotecs - who has not read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". But, wanting to make sure that I had the code framed correctly I had read \\"Angels and Demons - the prequel (see my review over there). I got both books in Blackpool, England and read them here while recovering from a travel injury - who said air travel today is boring?<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is not much better reading in England as it would have been at home in Austin, Texas. I cannot believe the furor about this book. Basically, it is a mediocre \\"little boy\\" book. Would have qualified as B level airplane reading but not much more. Why is it so popular? Well, I still don't know even after watching 3 hours of BBC television shows on the background, making of, truth and fiction behind it and the success of the book.<br /><br />All I can say is that this is a silly little - although almost 600 pages - book and an appropriate sequel to \\"Angels and Demons\\" - two silly books!.  Why did I read the whole thing? Why would an American watch a cricket match??? At least, it did not make me apoplectic!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Admittedly, I am a huge Tool fan.  I have been since I first saw them live on their Undertow tour back in '94.  I've been to 9 other shows since.  There is a reason for my obsession.  No other band, album, or individual song has struck such a resonant chord within my being like Tool.  It just feels right.  They make complicated, intricate music seem simple.  I challenge anyone who doesn't \\"get\\" Tool, to try to listen to only the drums on each song.  Danny Carey (the drummer) is absolutely phenomenol.  Once the you can enter the rhythm of the drums, all of the other instruments fall into place.  Anyway, about 10,000 days...  This album was everything I have been waiting for and more.  There are plenty of nay-sayers out there, but so what.  They don't get it.  What a sad life it must be to be a nay-sayer...nothing is ever good enough.  It is true what other people have been saying, this album grows on you.  I think part of it is that it is so overwhelming and complex the first few times you listen to it, it takes a little while to get your mental footing, so to speak.  Once you start to understand the music, the more you listen to it, the more you WANT to listen to it.  Once again, Maynard has outdone himself with his lyrics and vocal melodies.  \\"The Pot\\" stands out as a complete surprise with Maynards almost falsetto vocals layered over music that harkens back to \\"Opiate\\" or \\"Undertow\\".  I've read that some people find the track \\"10,000 days\\" boring and long, but oh my god, it is anything but.  The lyrics reference Maynards dead mother and her ascension to heaven, while the music grooves along with rain and thunder in the background.  Tool is not a force to be taken lightly, although those who don't get it act as if it is.  Those of us in the know treat the band and its art with reverence and respect.   <br /> <br />To think for yourself, you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness...chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself...then press play on this album, and lay back with your eyes closed...see you on the other side...
B0007XT87G|5.0|Okay, to all of you giving this CD three stars or under, you are either: <br /> <br />A) Upset because Porcupine Tree aren't making pop music like on Stupid Dream <br />B) Mad that they are EXPERIMENTING with heavier music <br />C) Mad because you heard this was METAL while a lot of it is not <br /> <br />Deadwing is NOT metal by any means. Listen to tracks like Lazarus, Arriving Somewhere but Not Here, Melotron Scratch, Glass Arm Shattering and The Start of Something Beautiful before making this stupid assumption. Sure, it has a lot of heavier elements than that of their earlier albums, but in my opinion, it is controlled. It isn't heavy for the sake of being heavy. <br /> <br />Standout tracks include the hard rocking title track and \\"Shallow\\", the poppy \\"Lazarus\\", the absolutely progressive, masterpiece known as \\"Arriving Somewhere but Not Here\\", the psychedelic \\"Mellotron Scratch\\", and \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\". Hell, every track on this CD is worth listening to because this album is pure brilliance. <br /> <br />Overall, Deadwing is worth every cent and every second you can give it. If you liked In Absentia, you will adore this album. If you like GREAT music, and don't judge this album as OMG ultimate death metal album, you will love it. Go get this now.

B000EHRVP6|1.0|I like horror.  I like gore.  I really really do.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre?  Awesome.  SAW?  Brilliant.  Cannibal Holocaust?  Hell yeah.  Hostel?  I think I'd rather be one of the victims than sit through this movie again.  I'll spare the details as I'm sure they've been rehashed to death, but... the entire movie was just a mess.  The first half was slow and boring, with uninteresting characters.  The second half, while fully living up to its blood feast promise, failed to shock or terrify.  Note to Eli Roth: Graphic torture scenes do not automagically equate to frightening, or even disturbing, when there is no emotional attachment to the characters.  It's just... \\"eh\\".  It's not that I'm numb to the violence... SAW disturbed me greatly, as have several other gory pictures, but, there was a connection with the  protagonists that just wasn't there in \\"Hostel,\\" with the exception of Kana.  She was innocent... her torture scene was the only one that shook me, and even by then you've been exposed to so much violence, crappy acting, and painful storytelling that you're just wanting the movie to end.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|New Aussie band Wolfmother are on the rise right now, with their retro hard-rock blend that is equal parts Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Maybe a bit of Deep Purple thrown in for good measure. With influences like that, this band has a lot to live up to.<br /><br />But in their self-titled debut album, Wolfmother proves that they are more than the sum of their influences. Their hard rock is murky, raw, and energetic, the sort of thing you can dance or mosh to, and their slower songs are still sharp and wild around the edges. This is definitely one for the fans of good rock'n'roll.<br /><br />It opens with an earsplitting yell, and if you're not expecting it, it's sure to make you sit up and listen. It's followed by a crunchy, murky mass of hard rock with an otherworldly edge. After getting lost in the desert, \\"I had to write something down/And I found myself alone, and then I let go of everything/Into another DI-MEN-SION!\\" frontman Andrew Stockdale hollers.<br /><br />Things steady out in the songs that follow, with Wolfmother exploring different kinds of hard rock. Yes, every kind I can think of. They dip into everything from steady bass grinds to hard psychedelica to catchy fuzz. And as they explore different sounds and styles, they manage to keep the same rough, wild edge in every song.<br /><br />Wolfmother even dabble in quieter music in \\"Mind's Eye,\\" a panoramic rock number with stretches of quiet, almost pretty music, and the closer almost sounds like a folk song at times. This band is in great form in these songs, which show the complexity of their music, but it sounds like the musicians are barely restraining themselves.<br /><br />There's something almost larger-than-life about Wolfmother's sound, with their wild lyrics and wilder musical skills. That quality is the sign of a really good rock band. They have energy, they have skill, and while their skill leans on that whole Zeppelin/Sabbath sound, they sound fresh.<br /><br />They also sound loud.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|It may seem strange but besides Ten, I always thought the best album that Pearl Jam ever made wasn't even an album, it was their collection of b-sides and rarities called Lost Dogs.  On that collection Pearl Jam played hard, anthemic rock as well as well crafted ballads that highlighted what they do well, stadium rock. <br /> <br />And low and behold, after close to a decade of being out in the proverbial woods away from mainstream rock, they have come back with this gem of an album.  Pearl Jam's self titled release is a definite return to form and one of the strongest releases so far this year.  <br /> <br />The album kicks off with a 5 pack of brilliant hard rocking numbers.  The highlight of this opening salvo is World Wide Suicide.  The song highlights Pearl Jam in fuzzy garage rock mode.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately the album peaks early, but the rest of the songs are far from throw away numbers.  Wasted Reprise seems kind of unneccesary, but other than that, the rest of the numbers are solid.  Come Back is probably the best song on the end of the album.  It's a well composed ballad with heartfelt lyrics that shows Pearl Jam can handle this material well.   <br /> <br />Pearl Jam seems to make catchy anthemic rock with such tossed off ease that it seems like they were shying away from that type of material for a better part of a decade because it wasn't challenging enough.  Though albums like Yield and No Code have their moments, this is definitely their best proper album since Vitalogy.  This comes highly recommended to any fan of Pearl Jam.  If you look good ole hard garage rock, then this album is also for you.
B000EULJLU|2.0|I haven't heard this album yet, but it can't possibly be better than Tool's masterpiece \\"Aenima.\\"  Lateralus was just OK.  They will never top Aenima.  Never.
B00095MLGC|5.0|Up the Downstair is one of the most underrated Porcupine Tree albums. It is probably my third or fourth favorite (with Deadwing, In Absentia and Signify in front) by this incredible band. This album has everything: hints of psychedelia, progressive rock, and some metal. <br /> <br />Standout tracks are the psychedelic \\"Synesthesia\\", the dreamy and melodic \\"Always Never\\", the groovy title track, the short but sweet \\"Small Fish\\", and my personal favorite (and supposedly, Steven Wilson's) \\"Fadeaway\\". The second disc, Staircase Infinities, is also very good.

0812550757|3.0|As a sequal to Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead is a disappointment.  However, the story itself is all right.      The story takes place 3000 years after the bugger war where Ender won the war by destroying the bugger race.  Now, humanity has a guilty conscience for that distruction.  For the last 3000 years Ender has been travelling at light speed, so time hasn't touched him much.  He is only 35.      He travels to a planet that has an intelligent species on it, affectionately called the piggies.  Not only is humanity feeling guilty about the bugs, but so it Ender.  A disturbing evolutionary trauma took place in the piggies past.  All life on the piggies' planet is infected with a virus that wiped out most life, leaving very little biodiversity.  When humans arrive, they become sick, but find a way to hold the virus at bay.  If the piggies leave the planet like they want to, any planet they touch down on will be reduced to chaos due to the virus.  Ender wants to make sure that the piggies are not exterminated.    Ender, also, has a secret.  The buggers were not totally extinct.  He carries with him a hive queen in suspended animation.  For the last 3000 years he's been waiting for the right planet and the right time to allow her to come to life and give birth to her 10,000 offspring.     All in all the book is all right, but is preachy throughout.  The message is that all that matters are intentions, not consequences, which Card announces not too far into the book.  Anybody can come up with hundreds, thousands, of examples throughout history where this type of sentiment is simply absurd.      Another questionable idea Card has is that keeping secrets, any secret, is bad and does harm.  The people I've run across who believe this lay bare people's lives out of spite and cruelty, or to sell newspapers.  Card foolishly thinks that laying bare your life will act as a catharsis, but I have yet to meet anyone who feels relieved after embarassing secrets are told.
B000EULJLU|3.0|That is a question I had to ask myself as I began listening to this album.  A five year wait does a lot to jack expectations for a new album sky high, so I was expecting genius on this album.  It this genius?  Well, I can't say that I absolutely love it, but it does have it's moments of genius.  Has Tool finally ran out of steam, are they spinning their wheels, did they finally make a bad album?  No, I don't think this is a bad album without merits, but it is the weakest of all there albums.   <br /> <br />The part of 10,000 Days that is genius is the 17 minute suite Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days.  Maynard beautifully eulogizies his mother with this tender piece of mellow and ambient progressive rock.  The 17 minute suite reminded me of Pink Floyd, circa Obscured by Clouds and Atom Heart Mother.  The songs are slow developing and meander, but this time I wasn't really worried about a song being 17 minutes long because I was enraptured by it for the whole time.   <br /> <br />If Wings for Marie/10,000 Days is a shining moment of genius, then Vicarious and all of the ambient interludes are where 10,000 Days shows it's flaws.  Vicarious sounds like Sober and Stinkfist redux.  For a band who doesn't keep their fans waiting for five years this is probably ok, but if you take five years and this is all you come up with, then you aren't trying hard enough.  Their is also too much ambient noise and soundscapes.  An album doesn't necessarily have to fill up a full 80 minutes.  Have some guts and make a 6 song album without filler ala King Crimson.   <br /> <br />Tool are unquestionably marketing geniuses.  They make two hugely popular and admittadly brillant albums in a row and develop a cult following who discet every note and word from these guys like they're sacred.  They wait five years and put out this good, but not great album that is just as dark and dense as anything they have ever done.  The Tool fans are so eager to get their hands on this album, that it is not just a new album, it's the next volume in the holy work of Tool.  If you are a fan, you probably already have this, if your not, do not start here.  Go for Aenima or Undertow, then get Lateralus.  It's not amazing, but it's still pretty good.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|this really is.......rubbish! im a big fan of all the final fantasy games and i so loved ff7. but the film was a bitter dissapointment. <br />bad-points:- the fighting sequences was just to fast to see what was happining and who was being hit.....bit like kung-fu-hustle with people flying though the air and all other bizzare things! theres no or little magic no summons(which i was expecting) you see very little of sepheroth? <br />all in all i would wait till its in the ?3.99 bin at your local off-licence!! and even then its a rip-off!

B000EMGAOY|5.0|RHCP just keep getting better and better. The album shows their depth and growth over the years. If you are an RHCP fan, you won't be disappointed. It's better than anything out there.
0441013597|5.0|See my other reviews to what is the best.  Don't get me wrong, this one is second out of hundreds and possibly thousands of sci-fi books that I've read.    Frank Herbert manages to write an unbelievably cool story, creating the most interesting characters that I've ever read about in fiction.  He, even, manages to carry on the story, writing excellent follow ups (books 2 and 3 OK, but 4 and 5 are just as solid as this one).      The book starts out with a planet swap between two royal families, the Atreides and the Harkonnens.  The swap turns out to be a double cross, with the emprorer in cahoots with the Baron Harkonnen (the emporer thinks House Atreides is too powerful).  All the Atreides gets wiped out, with the exception of Paul, Duke Atreides son, and the Duke's widow, Lady Jessica.    The Atreides took over Arrakis (Dune), a desert planet that is the only place in the universe where the spice exists, making it the most important planet.  No one knows too much about the spice since Dune is such a hostile planet, but it is harvested whenever possible.      Lady Jessica and Paul escape into the deep desert and are thought dead, but the Fremen, Dune natives, rescue them.  They find that the Fremens have harnessed the power of the spice and know its secret (how it's created).  The drug works as a geriatric drug making a person live longer and if used properly produces serious psychologic enhancements.      Lady Jessica becomes a high priestess among the Fremens due the change wrought by the spice.  For Paul, the spice changes him into a near god.  After two years of exile, he becomes the undisputed leader of the Fremens and marches on the Harkonnens and the rest of the universe with the formidable Fremen army.    Highly recommend this book to any reader, even those not interested in science fiction.
B0009ML238|5.0|I couldn't disagree more with the one-star reviewer.  Sure, there may be some similarities with DT and SyX, but a lot of prog metal bands have elements that sound like each other.  The real test is whether the songs are good.  The songs on this album are amazing.  \\"Sin\\" is one of the coolest songs I've heard. <br />\\"Alive\\" is also very enjoyable.  \\"Biosfear\\" is a great instrumental with smoking guitar.  I enjoy every song on this album.  There are a lot of different moods and textures, from smooth and soothing to ferocious.  The singer is great.  He has an awesome high range, and honestly sounds nothing like Labrie or Russell Allen.  If you like great prog metal, no matter what bands they may sound familiar to, then Circus Maximus will surely please.
0307276902|5.0|This is a great book. even if the author did \\"alter\\" some of his memories I still think it served the purpose the author was triing to get across. for you people who look at it as \\"oh he lied and made the whole thing up that makes me not like the book and I am not going to acknowlege it\\" I say thats the wrong thing to do. I thought it was a amazing book and it made me take a look at my own life. thank you james. top marks from me.

B0000029LG|4.0|My only real complaint with the first disc is the exclusion of Dirty Diana, Smooth Criminal and Give In To Me.  Other than that, it is definitely a fine collection.    The second disc is a decent collection of new and old material. Highlights include: Scream,They Don't Care About Us,Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song,Come Together,You Are Not Alone,Childhood,  History,Little Susie, and Smile.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|WrestleMania was a great ppv event and an even better dvd with tons of extras and the whole event too. Heres a review of the whole dvd. <br /> <br />Disc 1 <br />Wrestlemania video after the harlem boys choir sings <br /> <br />Match 1 United States Championship Big Show (c) Vs John Cena <br />The was pretty good opener it got the crowd going. Nice FU by cena even though big show kicked out it had a pretty good ending to a decent opener that did what it was suppose to. 6/10 <br /> <br />Backstage Bischoff tells Coach to look for the undertaker <br /> <br />Backstage Randy Orton cuts a promo on mick foley also show footage of the fued over the past couple of months <br /> <br />Match 2 World Tag Team Championship Fatal Four Way Booker T & Rob Van Dam vs The Dudley Boys vs La Resistance vs Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade. <br />This a pretty good tag team match better than the smackdown fatal four way match that happened later in the way. It was a good way to get alot of the raw stars on the card with a fatal four way. I rather have had this match been elimination style but still pretty decent some good moves by every team Nice sequence to finish the match. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />Backstage coach looks for the undertaker and runs into mean gene and bobby heenan pretty funny segment <br /> <br />Match 3 Christian Vs Chris Jericho <br />This was a really good match it had a pretty decent storyline with a good twist at the end of this match these two wrestlers had good chemistry. It was the first great match of the night and the whole match told a story. 8/10 <br /> <br />Mick Foley & The Rock interview pretty entertaining <br /> <br />Match 4 Handicap Match Randy Orton, Ric Flair & Batista Vs Mick Foley & The Rock <br />This was prolly the greatest handicap match ever because there havent even been that many good ones. This was a great match flair & The Rock were so over with crowd they had there enteraining moments of this match. The whole match was based around mick and randy orton but every wrestler had there moments in this match it good finish crowd was really into this one. 8/10 <br /> <br />WWE Hall Of Fame Ceremoy <br />all the wrestlers that were inducten in the class of o4 were shown. <br /> <br />Playboy Evening Gown Match Torrie & Sable Vs Jackie & Stacy <br />Wasnt really a match but all four women are just smoking hot. 2/10 for actual match but for the enterainment value 10/10 <br /> <br />Backstage Eddie motivates Chris Beniot <br /> <br />Match 6 WWE Cruiserweight Open Chavo Guerrero vs. Jamie Noble vs. Funaki vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Nunzio vs. Tajiri vs. Shannon Moore vs. Billy Kidman <br />This was a pretty enterianing match each wrestler got its spots in except for funaki. Just would have asked for about 5 or 10 minutes addes to this match but other than that was still a good match 7/10 <br /> <br />Match 7 Interpromotional Match: Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar: Special Guest-Referee, Stone Cold Steve Austin <br />This match was just terrible i mean it was so hyped up as being a brawl it just couldnt do anything right. It would have been better if both wrestlers didnt leave the company right after this match but still it was one of the biggest dissapoinments in wrestlemania history they should have added a gimmick like a cage match or something to make it more entaining. 4/10 <br /> <br />Mr. McMahon Thanks You <br /> <br />Match 8 WWE Tag Team Championship: Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi vs. APA vs. Basham Brothers vs. World's Greatest Tag Team <br />Nothing special pretty boring one worst matches of the night 4.5/10 <br /> <br />Disc 2 <br /> <br />Jesse the Body interview Donald Trump <br /> <br />Match 9 Women's Championship Victoria Vs Molly <br />Alright the gimmick really didnt help this bout go over 4/10 <br /> <br />Match 10 WWE Championship Eddie Guerrero Vs Kurt Angle <br />This was a hell of a match very good main event by smackdown both wrestlers gave it all they had and it really showed very originalway to end this match which proves the lying cheating and stealing for guerrero. 9/10 <br /> <br />Match 11 Undertaker Vs Kane <br />Pretty good storyline great promos to lead into this match real cool entrance by undertaker felt like a wrestlemania moment the overall match was alright wasnt long at all cause prolly undertakers ring rust. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Match 12 World Heavyweight Championship Chris Beniot Vs Triple H Vs Shawn Michaels <br />This was the match of the year what a match about 25 to 30 minute match that was action packed it had everything from tablebumps to submissions to techinacal wrestling even a little high flying manuvers. This will defienatly be remembered as one of the greatest main events to any ppv not only wrestlemania. 10/10 <br /> <br />WrestleMania XX Recall <br /> <br />Extras for (disc 2) <br />WWE Confidental  <br />The Rock 'N' Connection pretty good feature good length to. <br />NYC Press Conference pretty average press conference <br /> <br />Pre Match Comments <br />Billy Kidman <br />Rey Misterio <br />Molly <br />Mean Gene Okelund <br />pretty decent comments about there upcoming match or just wrestlemania in genera <br /> <br />Post Match comments <br />John Cena <br />RVD & Booker T <br />Mick Foley <br />Big Show <br />Christian <br />Chavo Guerrero <br />Billy Graham <br />Molly <br />Fans <br />Nothing special average at best <br /> <br />Dudley Boyz Vs Lance Storm & Val Venis  <br />match from the previous weeks sunday night heat for a spot in the title match pretty decent match 5/10 <br /> <br />Byte This eddie guerrero nice little extra interview <br /> <br />TV Promos prolly seen all of them before anyways but still good thing that they added them. <br /> <br />Disc 3 <br />The Mania of WrestleMania  <br />A great 45 minute documentary over wrestlemania XIX with a great voice over by jesse the body venture even has some deleted scenes that were not shown on Tv <br /> <br />WrestleMania 10 Greates Matches <br />Prettygood showcase of the ten greates matches hosted by ric flair there just highlights of the matches but still pretty good <br /> <br />Overall this is a great DVD to pick up <br />Match of the night easily the triple threat world championship match it was just a phenominal way to the the grand daddy of them all.
B000007MVM|4.0|This album is the sound of a man whose mind is sometimes lucid but more often than not in disarray. Consequently Syd's music is disjointed, haunting and haunted. Syd seems to realize only in his most lucid moments that he's not quite connected to the world anymore, but we can percieve his deterioration immediately. There's that feeling of whimsy that permeates the first Pink Floyd album, but there's also a darker and more desperate side to The Madcap Laughs that is it's unique and ironic strength. It's sometimes scattershot and full of nonsequitors both lyrical and musical, and Syd's backing band obviously had trouble playing with him. But when it works, most often on the acoustic songs, Syd's music is deeply emotional. The old flashes of brilliance are very apparent even as Syd's once bright sun is slowly extinguished by his madness.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|This movie is as good as the novel by Stephen King. Some things were changed, but I still love this film. The effects and actng were great.
B00005221M|5.0|\\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is a thrilling movie based on a book by the same title authored by James Fenimore Cooper. The film is well produced and with great acting. The music is outstanding and the photography and scenery are marvellous. The movie is close to the original story in the book.<br /><br />The action and costumes are realistic. The film does a good job of showing the indigenous/native Americans in very good light. The film shows their rich culture and customs and their epic struggle to maintain their way of life.<br /><br />This is an entertaining romance and adventure movie. The adventure side is characterised by a lot of fighting and manly deeds. The romance side has an interesting love triangle where two men, one that is rich and despicable and the other poor and a gentlemanly have to compete for the same pretty lady.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|After \\"listening\\" to the trailers for \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" I was captivated by the beautiful orchestral music mixing in with the choir...<br /><br />I went into a craze just to get this cd... and its amazing!<br /><br />Hans Zimmer knows how to make music, the classical way... Amazing in movies like King Arthur...<br /><br />I recommend any instrumental listener to get this score!
0684824906|1.0|Buy this book only if you want to contribute to Doris' effort to buy a house in the Hamptons. There is almost nothing new in this book. Not quite [...], it very closely follows the detailed works of Catton, Sandburg and Foote.  Her attention to the battles of the Civil War is embarrassingly scant. Doris does however excel in the re-retelling of little personal tidbits and petty gossip concerning Lincoln and those around him-great and small.  THIS OVERRATED BOOK IS NOT A BOOK FOR THE SERIOUS CIVIL WAR OR LINCOLN SCHOLAR.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Not a bad moment on this album!, <br />these are the songs I expect to become famous, <br />(1 being the best chance, 10 being still a good chance.) <br />1.

Death Of A Martian (can imagine playing on music channels) <br />9. Turn It Again <br />10. Hard To Concentrate <br /> <br />I would of put Dani California at number 8, but thats all ready famous so there's no need. <br />This is one of there best albums, heres my five favourites in order. <br />1.

B000002IZ4|5.0|The poetic heroine induced lyrics of Scott Wieland, the catchy hard guitar riffs of Dean DeLeo, and the concise song structures all are rolled into a tight package better known as Purple by Stone Temple Pilots.     The album begins with a hard rock, grungy sounding song called Meatplow that will certainly delight grunge fans and headbangers. The next song, vasoline, a massive radio hit, is very concise in song structure. The music on this song is also very repetitous and hard. Lounge Fly, the next track on the album is also very hard and in additon to this precussion heavy.    Interstate Love Song, a classic alt.rock/hardrock single follows Lounge Fly. Hook filled and concise, the song finishes in about 3:20. \\"Leavin on a Southern Train only yesterday you lied\\" sings Scott Wieland in delusionment.    The rest of the album is similar. Most of the songs are very concise like the first half of the album. Still remains is a beautifully written song discussing sexual tension. Pretty Penny is an acoustic song that sounds much different from the other songs on the album. Ah yes... Silver Gun Superman... a hard rock song that discussing jealously in relationships... should please headbangers. Big Empty is a catchy power ballad, that is featured in the movie The Crow. Unglued is a hard rock song discussing let's just say something very common in a teenage boy's life... ok.... Army Ants a song that has awesome lyrics and a very interesting meaning if you can understand Scott's heroine induced babbling. Finally is Kitchenware and Candy Bars- the first half of this song is best defined as a power-ballad with Wieland singing \\"sell me down the river.\\" After this a strange strange hidden track follows, completing a 42:00 long masterpiece. Highly reccomended to grunge fans, alt.rock fans and headbangers.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Not the best of RHCP but still an amazing cd.  There isn't 1 song that I don't mind listening to.  The best tracks in my proffessional opinion are Snow, Charlie, Stadium Arcadium(like californication), Hump De Bump(strait funky and make me wanna start dancing), She's Only 18(sick classic rock sound), Torture Me, Strip My Mind(Slow and kinda sounds like The Band's \\"\\"), 21st Century, Readymade(vicious solo, heavier sounding), Made You Feel Better(upbeat), So Much I(also funky as hell), and finally Storm In A Teacup (perfect classic RHCP song). All the others are nice as hell too but these are just the standouts.
B000B8657S|3.0|The recording of all 600-plus of Franz Schubert's songs was a labor of love for Hyperion Records and accompanist Graham Johnson. The project was characterized by a consistent level of top-notch performances by some of the premier Lied singers of our generation. While there might seem an economy in buying this complete 40-disc set, Beware. Inside the box you get 37 CDs of Schubert's songs for piano and voice presented in chronological order of composition, plus three CDs of songs by contemporary composers, often setting the same poems that Schubert used. Also included is a 400-page book of The Complete Song Texts, but here is the rub: the book lacks the liner notes from the individual CD booklets of the series.<br /><br />Graham Johnson's original commentaries had insights into the genesis of the songs and the technical features fitting music to text. Where you got an exhaustive paragraph (or five) devoted to each song, here you get only a thumbnail biography of each year in Schubert's life followed by the texts of the songs for that year. The print is very small and the English translations are in an italicized font that makes the h's look like b's. Hyperion admits the difficulty of reprinting the original liner notes: \\"Several university presses have shown interest until they realised the scale of the project. We have worked out that the publication would run to nearly a million words--without the song texts. It would need at least two volumes. So we must see.\\" In the meantime there is John Reed's Schubert Song Companion with commentaries on a majority of these songs.<br /><br />There is a scholarly benefit to the chronological sequencing of the songs; you can trace Schubert's development from precocious teen to master songcrafter. There is some tediousness in the early material, however. Adrian Thompson tackles a lot of the awkward young works, and generally I would want to skip these when relistening to the set. Another quirk of the chronological presentation is that it divides Winterreise across two CDs. Schubert composed this work in two parts as he discovered M&uuml;ller's poems, hence there are intervening songs that divide the opus. Frankly, I would have preferred Winterreise on one disc.<br /><br />It is nice, in one way, that by reordering the series you get a continuously varied lineup of performers; sopranos followed by tenors followed by altos and baritones. If, however, you want to listen to everything recorded by Arleen Auger, her material is scattered across fifteen discs. There is something to be said for the focus of the original CDs--Goethe songs, strophic songs, water songs, night, nature, etc. Schubert had a vast output that lends itself to thematic programming. Graham Johnson himself frames it best in the notes to Volume 1:<br />\\"[The lesser-known songs] are, in their own shy way, treasures, but placed together in a large jewel-case, a boxed set, there is a danger that too many of them, one after the other, make a dull effect.... Should they not be displayed a few at a time where the famous items of the collection throw light on, rather than show up, their humbler brothers?\\"<br /><br />There are omissions in the box set, not of actual songs but of individual performances. Janet Baker's rendition of \\"Der Pilgrim\\" D794 is left out to avoid duplication with Thomas Allen's. Three tracks from Brigitte Fassbaender's solo disc are replaced with takes by other singers. So on for Anthony Rolfe Johnson, Margaret Price and others.<br /><br />If I had to do it all over again I would invest in each of the individual CDs of the series. If a book of the liner notes is ever published, that will be another chunk of money, diminishing the economy of the box set. For those of you interested in Schubert's chronological development as a song writer--get the original CDs, rip them as MP3s onto your computer, resequence them according to Hyperion's Web site and upload them onto your iPod.Winterreise across two CDs.

If a book of the liner notes is ever published, that will be another chunk of money, diminishing the economy of the box set. For those of you interested in Schubert's chronological development as a song writer--get the original CDs, rip them as MP3s onto your computer, resequence them according to Hyperion's Web site and upload them onto your iPod.
B000AARKO4|5.0|I know most people will disagree with me when I say this is a better movie than Gladiator but it is.  It is about two cultures fighting for what they belive is right.  It is a fantastic movie.  The thing I don't like is that Ridley Scott seems to wimp out by portraying the Christians as bloodthristy and having the Muslims seem like heroes.  Its almost as if hes afraid of upsetting people. Overall its a great film.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Most of tool's previous albums were much easier to enjoy. They kicked off excellent and immediatly entered your blood, and began flowing through your body. I'm saying this having only heard Aemina and Lateralus. They both had interesting beginings for the albums, as well as cool names. So, I wonder if Tool was in the studio and had an idea to make their fans believe they they had given up with their cool music. With a common sounding beginning, and a dull name. Then they did another thing, they changed their music to be a quiet, subtle, and probably the most emotional album they've made. The songs are certainly more emotional than their earlier songs like \\"Hooker with a penis\\". Hmm. <br />Yeah, but this album is good. It probably would have done much better if it had been released in the Winter though.
B000EULJLU|2.0|The new album is like a series of bad romps in the back seat...    You get five minutes of flabby, veiny [...] a flash of the Holiest of Holies, a couple of quick tugs on the johnson, and peck on the cheek.    There are four separate spots where things drag on for several minutes, obviously missing whatever groove they thought they had, and when they finally get into something tasty, it's over in like 20 seconds. I don't want to have to dance with Mr. Brownstone or eat some 'shrooms to \\"get it\\".     Sure the last two disks took some time, and several listens to get all of the textures, and you have to have already bought into it to give that much time. But believe me, TOOL detractors, it paid off with the last two disks.    But this mostly meanders, doesn't find a groove (not hooks mind you, just some musicality that's worth listening to) for a very long time, and when one reveals itself, they seem to want to kill it as soon as possible and launch off into another \\"mood setting\\" piece.    But if you set the mood, let build up and anticipation begin and grow, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE AN EVENTUAL PAYOFF!!! Very little here. Lot's of teasing, lot's of texture, with a little crunch and out.    TOOL seems to be trying to be too many things and finally is nothing at all. If they want to be prog, and have 15 minute suites, they've got to have more musicality throughout to keep the listener's head in the game. Listen to YES' Relayer, long, meandering tracks, but, after several listens, every inch has something worth hearing. THIS is TOOL'S Tales From Topographic Oceans. Too indulgent, some decent sounds, but nothing sustaining to make it worth the listen.    I guess I've just got face it, Undertow was the best, Aenima was different, but listenable front to back, Lateralus had some weak spots, but was offset by some truly amazing spots, perhaps some of the best so far. This just doubled the weak spots, without compensating passages, with brutal vocal mix into the bargain. Might have been 2.5 or 3 stars, but just too many mounting weaknesses.    In the immortal words of Neal Page- \\"Here's a good idea - have a POINT. It makes it SO much more interesting for the listener!\\"

B00001U0CP|5.0|I thought this was a real page turner.  It was chalk full of forensics details that made the tense action very real to me.  The action was smart and full of unpredictable surprises.  At the same time, Dr. Scarpetta is a very human and likeable character, and the book has quite a bit of deep emotion in addition to the fast action.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Most double albums are hard to get through without getting sick of the music, but this album is perfect.  First Disc is a little bit softer ('by the way' type songs), and the second disc is heavier, both are incredible. The good thing about this album is that you instantly pick your favorites, and then it gets hard because they are all good.  And then before you know it, the songs that weren't your favorites soon become them....buy this album.
0930289528|3.0|Despite the author's bellyaching, the film version of this book is a vast improvement. The movie gets rid of extraneous characters, improves the dialogue, deletes the anti-climactic ending, makes sensible changes regarding plot and characterization, and generally polishes up what is essentially a fairly amateurish \\"graphic novel.\\" The seeds of a good story are there, but a good *editor* was clearly nowhere to be found. Additionally, the book's artwork is murky, dark, and the inking isn't crisp. Go see the movie instead.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This CD goes off all the way thru.. I thought it couldnt get much better than crazy but the whole CD is on point..  I bought it and have been listening every since..

1860498825|5.0|This novel is set around the 1860s in London and full of rich details about how people lived, worked (and didn't work) and survived in and around this incredible city. Sarah Waters is a witch of a story-teller so there was no question of putting this book down once I started.<br /><br />It's a story of Sue, an orphan raised by Mrs. Sucksby among thieves in Southwark, who is taken into a scheme by posing as a maid to Maud whom a dashing ne'er-do-well nicknamed \\"Gentleman\\" intends to marry and then send to the madhouse, dividing her fortune between himself and Sue.  That's the barest plot outline possible, otherwise I'll spoil the best for the new reader.<br /><br />In the main, this story describes a quest, the quest for Sue and Maud to extricate themselves from their gargantuan physical and emotional difficulties and see each other again.  They are thwarted by enormous obstacles: were ever fictional characters made to endure so much torture?!  They live only to find each other and, one assumes, some real quiet, quality time together at last.  This final 'at last' is the Holy Grail of this story within which is depicted tremendous characterizations and hair-raising, shocking (gasp!) situations.<br /><br />At first the characterizations made me laugh, they were that delightful and full of fun.  And language!  They spat and spoke, snarled, snapped, swore and sermonized all on top of each other in Mrs. Sucksby's overheated kitchen filled with various levels of thieving souls.  The deeper I went into this labyrinth of a plot -- as well being a labyrinth of viciousness and nastiness -- the more impatient I became to find the thread, to see where we were going in this intrigue.  No one in this book is good, and not many are even nice. The exception is in some of the smaller players, in particular Charles the Knife boy, who almost never stops crying, a characteristic waterfall of tears which Sue puts to good use when she needs to beg on the street and people take pity on the weeping Charles, a wonderful touch among many such.
B000053VAF|5.0|The massage is a good one however comming from catholics , it's hard to take seriously . I was raised CHRISTAN but lost my faith because I'm a minority and the church my family went to wasn't very open minded . I was teased , threaten , and even assaulted because it's christan belief to be fearfull of any one who's different and to impower them selves at minority's expence !<br />What do I mean by impower ? Christans project there insecuritys , personal problems , objections of \\"kinds of people\\" and the world around them , and will use minoritys as examles (SLANDER) in any kind of complaint of any kind about people (liberals) ... THEY ALSO MISTREAT AND DEMEAN US BECAUSE THEY WANT TO THINK THEIR BETTER THEN US ! It's this elitist dishonest , bigoted , makebeleave , nonsense that has left me hatefull of RELIGION !<br /><br />AS FOR THE FILM , IT'S FUNNY AND VERY SMART ..... JUST DON'T JUDGE ALL CATHOLICS BY THE MESSAGE IN THIS FILM , NOT ALL CHRISTIANS ARE AS OPEN MINDED AS THE ONES WHO MADE THIS FILM .<br /><br />P.S. KEVIN SMITH RULES !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000EULJLU|3.0|First of all I rate this 3 1/2 stars, I wish Amazon would enable .5 stars.  Secondly, I have listened to this entire album and more than once.  Some people, namely hardcore fans, will review an album without even listening to the whole piece of work.  Now for the review... <br /> <br />After five years of waiting, Tool has arrived with an 11 song monster album.  10,000 Days starts off with the explosive Vicarious, which is a vicious attack on the media.  I felt the instrumentation was excellent but Maynard's whispered vocals didn't seem to fit the context of the song.  The next is just as powerful, maybe better if it had more changes.  It is titled Jambi and contains a mind blowing chugging riff throughout.  Wings for Marie and it's \\"sister\\" song the self titled track work well together, but little change occurs.  Tool's previous work use to contain many different key changes and bridges, whereas this one almost gets boring, but in a sense does contain an ambience to it.  The Pot is a great song with Maynard really stretching his voice like I've never heard.  I wasn't even sure if it was him until 2 minutes into the song.   <br /> <br />The problem with the album comes with the 6th and 7th tracks.  I felt annoyed by the two and yes, they are fillers.  After a five year absence one might think Tool would supply their deserving fans with more than filler, I don't have time for them. <br /> <br />The album does redeem itself with the intense Roseta Stoned which might be as insane as Ticks and Leeches from the last record.  My favourite song is easily the last song Right in Two, it displays all of Tool powers and from every band member.  I say this is the last track because Viginti Tres is just a slap in the face to the record and its listener.  Static and noise is no way to close an album and it left the 10,000 days and myself feeling empty. <br /> <br />I would recommend this record if you have all the others and want more.  Don't expect to be blown away, but do expect pleasant changes and nice surprises.  Perhaps in another 10,000 days we will get another Tool record and it will be more solid.
B00000JS1M|5.0|I can't believe those that rated this album with 1 or 2 stars. This was, and is, definitely one of the best Metal albums of all time. I remember when the album originally came out. It was viewed as Saxon's best. I actually had the opportunity to see Saxon after this album came out. They were incredible. It's ashame that they never received the recognition they deserved. <br /> <br />For true Metal fans, get this album! It should defintely be in your collection if you appreciate original 80's Heavy Metal and not some water downed version of it.
0743455967|5.0|Love this book. When I began writing, I read it from cover to cover.<br /><br />It was a great insight into Mr. King himself but also offered additional \\"nuts and bolts\\" of writing I needed to know...like write a minimum of XYZ words per day, how to set up your writing area, etc<br /><br />I loved the part of the book where he shares with the reader his initial phone call about his first big sale - Carrie - in paperback. I got chills and said, \\"I can do that if I develop my talent and work hard.\\"<br /><br />I recommed this book for any new writer.
0375831002|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I read a lot. This book delivered more physical chills with it's truth than any other I've ever read. It is slow going at first, but it is necessary to truely understand the losses that occur later. I just finished the book. I'm sitting at my desk at work, sneaking in a chapter where I can, just like Liesel did, and as I neared the end, I actually started crying. Words really can be the most powerful force on earth.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I read and loved the novel, and have yet to see the play, but the soundtrack is fabulous on its own. Although it may not have the best vocals you can find in a Broadway performance, and some of the lyrics are a bit awkward at parts, the orchestra completely makes up for it all. Plus, the songs are terribly catchy, and will play in your head for days, maybe weeks, after you listen to the soundtrack a couple of times. And now for the song by song breakdown: <br /> <br />No One Mourns the Wicked - As with all the songs on this CD, the orchestra is amazing. The beginning isn't my favorite, because Chenoweth (Glinda) is singing in the style of Glinda in the movie. You know; high and uninterpretable. It gets much better through the middle though.  <br /> <br />Dear Old Shiz - Short and sweet. Not a huge hit when compared with the other tracks, but the vocals are nice, and the story it tells is important. <br /> <br />The Wizard and I - Menzel (Elphaba) is wonderful in this song, although I dislike all of Shelley's (Madame Morrible)parts. Again, the story is important. <br /> <br />What is this Feeling? - Hilarious! The orchestra, again, is fantastic. The lyrics are funny, and the vocals are perfect for the song. I believe there is one spot where the harmony is off by a little bit, but this song will be stuck in your head for forever. This is one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Something Bad - Youmans (Doctor Dillamond) has a nice voice, if you will pardon the goat sounds. Again, Menzel shines in this song. <br /> <br />Dancing Through Life - First off, a bit of extra opinion here, but Butz (Fiyero) has an incredibly sexy voice. Apart from that, the vocals are fantastic, the lyrics are funny and slightly philosophical, and the music changes are great. I love this song. <br /> <br />Popular - One word: Fantastic. Popular is incredibly catchy, and very well done on Chenoweth's part. <br /> <br />I'm Not That Girl - Sweet and sad. The orchestra, however, is the saving grace ofthis song. <br /> <br />One Short Day - Very catchy, and of course, important to the story. <br /> <br />A Sentimental Man - Grey's (The Wizard) vocals are alright. But this isn't one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />Defying Gravity - Probably one of my all-time favorites of this album. If you know the story, you know how sad it is. The music is incredible, the vocals wonderful, lyrics are incredible and memorable, and the story is heart breaking. My favorite part: \\"So if you care to find me, look to the western sky\\". <br /> <br />Thank Goodness - If Shelley hadn't had a part in the middle of this song, I would really like it. I always fast forward past that part. The rest of the song is really good. At the end you'll be thinking 'Poor Glinda'. <br /> <br />Wonderful - The best of Grey's songs. <br /> <br />I'm Not That Girl (Reprise) - Better with Chenoweth singing it. The music is superb. <br /> <br />As Long As You're Mine - So incredibly sweet. The vocals are fabulous, the music better. This song deserves being set on repeat. <br /> <br />No Good Deed - My favorite track on the entire album. Menzel pulls off the bitterness and longing perfectly. It's a tragic song and gives you an insight into Elphaba's mind. The music, especially the bass beats at the end, is spectacular. <br /> <br />March of the Witch Hunters - An okay song. The background singers are best. <br /> <br />For Good - Very sad. Pretty good. I've heard it's better live. Personally, I think it's too hard to follow up As Long As You're Mine and No Good Deed. <br /> <br />Finale - Good music of course. Not incredibly important, but still very good. <br /> <br /> <br />My advice: Buy this album. You definitely won't regret it. The songs are moving, funny, beautiful, and they all tell such a wonderful story. And I think the music is some of the best on Broadway that I've heard.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|The only reason I saw this movie in the first place is that I saw Cloud, Sephiroth, and the others in Kingdom Hearts, and then I saw the trailer for this movie.  Being the hormonal 18 year old I am, I thought 'Hey, Sephiroth is hot in KH, so why not watch the movie?'  Well, when I did, I was blown from my seat.  The visuals are wonderful, and so is the voice acting.  I have never played a single Final Fantasy game, but the movie was still easy to follow, and the action was spetacular. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie for everyone, except little kids of course, cause it has a PG-13 rating.  It doesn't matter if you've never played FF, this movie is for you!

0307276902|1.0|i picked up this book (at the library, fortunately) to see what all the hype is about. btw, note that had this guy not been backed by oprah, not a word have been said. but i digress. i envy frey his lucrative writing career, but he is by no stretch of the imagination a great writer. it's pretty boring, actually. every day in rehab is the same. he eats, he talks with people, he argues with counselors about how he'll never get better, he berates himself for being a drug addict and criminal, he pines over a girl, he eats lunch and dinner, and then we repeat the cycle.  <br /> <br />and, pre-oprah hype, how could anyone not see the fake parts of this book? the scene in which he describes Leonard's father dying -- is so fakey and straight out of a Godfather or Goodfellas movie. uck.  <br /> <br />worth a peek if you're curious, but see if you can borrow your friend's copy. or hit the library.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Okay, I want to say first off that I'm and RHCP fan til the end, and even after then :) Since the day my big sis blasted her Mother's Milk tape (yes, tape), I was hooked. Ever since that time I've proceeded to purchase all tapes, then cds Chilis. So, yeah, I'm a little bias. That being said, I find this new release a nice progression of their finely honed sound and 23 year music career. Any die hard fan can appreciate outcome of years of chaos to produce their finest achievement. And, honestly, if they're anything like me, two cds is a perfect amount to feel satisfied by and should hold me over for however long it takes for them to release another cd (which I will buy without hesitation). Sure I miss the spitting lyrical warped rapping our beautiful AK has provided most notibly in the past on Blood Sugar Sex Magik (my personal favorite that almost never leaves my cd rotation). Of course, as everyone know, Flea is the master of the bass. He can't be rivaled. Johns talent on the guitar (the man sees the guitar as an extension of himself) is powerful in a way that hasn't been properly displayed since BSSM. Chad is just the MAN and as always, a force to be rekoned with. As you can see my love is deep. Anyway, you'll have your own favorites as I have have mine. Just by damn thing and let it invade your soul. <br /> <br /> <br />~ And it's nice out here. I think I'll stay for a while. . .
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This movie was a great reflection of Johnny Cash's life. However, I think it could have been longer. It spends brief moments on his childhood and on his adult life as a star. Flashing from one moment of the childhood tragedy of the death of his brother. Then to his failed marriage to Vivian Cash.  <br /> <br />The one thing this film did focus on was the relationship that Johnny Cash had with his father after the death of his older brother Jack. The arguments between him and his father who never seemed to think that anything Johnny ever did in his life was worth anything. Complaining about his failed career as a door to door salesman which barely put food on the table and a roof over his families head which was not the life that his wife Vivian was accustomed to. <br /> <br />Then, Enter the fiery June Carter, who becomes johnny's singing partner, they record and perform some of the greatest hits in Country music history such as \\"The Ring of Fire\\" written by June Carter about falling in Love With Johnny and \\"Jackson\\" which they performed together after Johnny's Marriage Proposal to June on stage, She later helps Johnny through his drug addiction.  <br /> <br />This was an amazing movie but the story Line moved to quick it didn't elaborate on any single part in his life.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Attempting to understand what drives people to kill other people for any reason is, in the pit of the soul, a challenging enigma.  Whether that 'reason' is war between countries at odds, protecting one's self when endangered, revenge or vengeance for deeds perpetrated by 'the other', for panic in the moment of survival - each of these feels wrong despite the fundamental belief to the contrary at the moment of killing.  MUNICH is about killing, about vengeance, about protection of 'home', about existence in a world so bifurcated by age-old schisms, and about us.  And while absorbing all of the 2 1/2 hour plus visual and philosophical information put forth in this epic film, the viewer is so paralyzed by the story that blinking for a second seems irreverent.<br /><br />The tragedy of the 1972 Olympics - the brutal kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes by masked Arab/Palestinian marauders - is brought to the screen with brave and gutsy realism by a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth based on George Jonas' book Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, directed with straightforward, no-nonsense sensitivity to all participants by Steven Spielberg, and brought to life by a cast that simply could not be finer.  From the opening of the film sans credits with the Black September act of breaking into the Olympic games in Munich, the film moves swiftly through the formation of an anti-terrorist league of Israeli assassins whose job it is to hunt down the killers and murder them, to the final painfully unsettled end.  This is all under the instruction and guidance of Golda Meir (brilliantly played by Lynn Cohen) and her advisors.<br /><br />The team of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler), and Mossad Accountant (Oded Teomi) are instructed by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) and stripped of their identities to enter this mission.  They roam the world based on information purchased from a secret group led by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and Papa (Michael Lonsdale).  Gradually growing into the roles of assassins the group begins to murder each of the perpetrators until their success is noticed by all manner of secret agencies (including the American CIA) and the tables are turned: the lives of the Israeli assassins are as endangered as those of the Arab murderers.  In a particularly touching moment in the dark, Avner and a Palestinian soldier debate the need for the state of Israel and the opposite need for holding onto home by the Palestinian: it is a moment of writing that sums up the entire Israeli conflict.<br /><br />The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and the music score by the always fine John Williams add dimensions of atmosphere to this dark film, but it is Spielberg doing what he does best in directing attention to moments in history that will never be buried that makes this phenomenal movie an emotional experience for everyone, no matter their political or religious beliefs.  It is simply a brilliant film about the need for Home - that sacred place whether internal or external that maintains the reason to live and even to die for it.  Highly Recommended.

B000B8QG4A|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when I was younger, and wanted to share it!! <br />It is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie for all ages! <br />I will enjoy watching it again!! <br />It will bring a SMILE to your face!
0553579908|4.0|The novel basically served as a beginning to the epical series(GOT being an intro to the characters). After the unexpected twists and turns in the last novel, all the characters now are faced with increasingly difficult decisions as swords are unsheathed and fires of war rage in the seven kingdoms after the tentative peace brought down by Robert's usurping the throne is finally destroyed by Lannister greed. As I said great, but due to the nature of the novel, which is to position the players of the game of thrones for the storm that is to come, the plot might be slow to some; still it's definately worth the read.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|... you can't get past the fact that the Peppers in '06 don't sound like they did in '86. It took the Beatles what, six years to get from \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" to \\"A Day in the Life\\"? And here some people are griping about how the Peppers 20 years on aren't still swaggering around with socks on their dongs and slapping out sophomoric funky jams about getting laid. That isn't growing soft or selling out; it's called maturing - as human beings, as men, as musicians. Unless the band in question is AC/DC, I have no interest in hearing a band sound exaclty like they did 20 years ago. Fact is, I really wasn't a fan of the Peppers back then; not because I was too young, but becaust that stuff just didn't interest me. But this does. The musicianship on this album is incredible, and it's one of the most consistent double albums I've ever heard. To my ears, there's almost no filler here, and I'm finding a new favorite song on it every time I listen (at last pass, it was \\"Wet Sand.\\") And yet for all the musical maturity on display, it's still funky and fun - it's not like these guys are making Sting records for the wine and cheese set. I'm by no means a diehard Peppers fan, but this album blows me away.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have always been a fan of the red hot chili peppers. this album totally rocks. I listened to the bass and was blown away by his style of playing. I wish that i could filter out each instrument to hear how the band works so well together.There are twenty eight tracks and none of them are fillers. The price was cheap for the quality of the album.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Without comparing Wolfmother to anyone, this is an extremely listenable album.  I was first introduced to Wolfmother when I heard there Australian release of Minds Eye.  The track order is different than the U.S. release and some of the songs were rerecorded for the U.S. release.  I immediately fell in love with the sound these guys produced, but I am a greater fan of the original track line up.  Wolfmother has been getting some sub par reviews because they sound very similar to a Black Sabbath/Led Zeppelin type band.  It is true, they do have a nostalgic sound of the '70s, but they have added there own sound to it.  Songs such as Vagabond and Minds Eye are two songs that show what Wolfmother is all about.  You will not see that type of variety on any album released after '78 or '79.  For those who feel these guys sound too much like Zep or Sabbath, remember, even the mighty Led Zeppelin used old blues songs early in their career to produce a sound they could call their own.  If you don't believe me, look at songs such as Bring it on Home from Led Zeppelin II and Gallow's Pole from Led Zeppelin III.  These songs are old blues songs made modern (for thier time) by Zeppelin.  For a final statement, if you are a music lover who is looking for a different sound than what is constantly being released during this day and age, you will like Wolfmother...if you are a classic rock fan who loves such bands as The Who, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, King Crimson, and many more, you will absolutely love Wolfmother!!!
B000E5KOJS|5.0|Jean-Pierre Ponnelle specialized in filming opera: lip synching the singing while recording recitatives live. He intended to film all of Mozart's operas but passed away (in August 1988), scant weeks after the completion of this film. He filmed only 4 Mozart operas: le Nozze di Figaro, la Clemenza di Tito, Mitridate and Cosi. It is a pity we will never see his Don Giovanni or Magic Flute. Ponnelle brought keen insight and subtle beauty to his filmed operas: never more evident than here, in his vision of a contest of mistaken identity and love held in a beautiful seaside Palladian villa.<br /><br />Mozart composed Cosi fan Tutte in a few weeks in autumn 1789 on commission from Emperor Joseph II of Austria (famous for this critique of Mozart: \\"Too beautiful for our ears and monstrous many notes, my dear Mozart\\". Mozart supposedly replied \\"Exactly as many as necessary, your majesty\\"). 1789 was a hard year for the composer. He composed few other works that year as he sank into despondency over his financial situation. Despite his emotional turmoil, Cosi is one of his loveliest scores with 12 gorgeous arias balanced by 18 ensembles of heart melting beauty. All this is framed by an indefinable sadness; creating that trademark Mozartian emotional ambiguity, hallmark of his greatness. When done right, Cosi fan Tutte (\\"They all do it\\" or \\"They are all like that\\". It loses in translation.) just might be the most perfect opera buffa Mozart ever composed. The opera premiered in Vienna on 26 January 1790. It was immediately controversial for its subject matter. Beethoven hated it, considering it immoral and idiotic. That kind of criticism didn't help its commercial prospects in the 19th Century.<br /><br />Ponnelle manages to get it right, with the proper combination of visual and vocal beauty. Because the singers lip synch their arias, they can concentrate on their acting which is good enough for comic opera. It was filmed in Munich 1-15 June 1988 with the sound recording made 25 February-12 March 1988 in Vienna. Edita Gruberova and Delores Ziegler are the sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella. They are very similar in appearance: making the story that much more believable. They even sound somewhat alike. I had some difficulty telling them apart, which made the opera more fun for me. I thought they were fine in the film. Ferruccio Furlanetto is Guglielmo. He is a well known Leporello, so Mozart wears well on him. Luis Lima is Ferrando. They are both energetic, if not especially romantic, lovers. Their singing is fine with Furlanetto the better comedian. Don Alfonso is sung by the distinguished looking Paolo Montarsolo. He looks the part, though his voice does get a little tattered now and again. Teresa Stratas is Despina and she is funny and effervescent when it is called for. Mozart indicates that she is to sing \\"dryly\\" in her comic scenes in disguise. Some may find her voice grating when she goes over-the-top. Her normal singing voice is limpid and warm. Quite a contrast. Nikolaus Harnoncourt conducts the Vienna Philharmonic, drawing a good, solid performance from them. I thought they lacked a little of their usual Mozartian sparkle. Perhaps this was an artifact of recording for a film.<br /><br />The picture format is NTSC with a 4:3 aspect ratio shot full-screen. The picture appears digitally remastered for this apparent DGG DVD re-release. It looks fine and clear with no visual artifacts. If there were any, they have now been removed. Region code is 0 worldwide. Sound formats are PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 Digital Surround. Both formats sound good with the DTS widening the soundfield and providing nice ambiance from the rear speakers. Menus are in English. Subtitles are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Chinese. There is a marvelously revealing 34 minute film of Ponnelle rehearsing Cosi as a bonus. Total time of the 2 discs is 209 minutes.<br /><br />Ponnelle's final fimed opera is beautiful to look at and lovely to listen to. It is not the finest recorded Cosi but it is quite good nevertheless. Recommended, as long as it is not your only Cosi fan tutte and you are willing to accept lip synching.<br /><br />Mike BirmanCosi but it is quite good nevertheless.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Trying to pin down how I feel about \\"10,000 Days\\" has been a real struggle.  Like most of you, my first impression of the album was not very good.  I was disturbingly disappointed.  TooL was one of those bands that I believed would never let me down.  They came dangerously close to doing just that with \\"10,000 Days.\\"  Of course I kept listening ...over and over.  The biggest challenge was Wings Pt 1 & 2.  \\"Too much open space for a TooL record\\" was my original thought.  So, I focused on those two songs for days.  I could tell that if I was ever going to completely love \\"10,000 Days\\" I would have to find a way to like Wings Pt 1 & 2.  Well, considering my 5 star rating of \\"10,000 Days\\" I think it's pretty obvious what happened.  Wings pt 1 & 2 have really opened up to me and I thoroughly enjoy both songs (especially pt 2 which I now consider a TooL classic).  After my \\"Wings\\" experiment the rest of the album was much easier to enjoy. \\"Vicarious,\\"  \\"Jambi,\\" \\"The Pot,\\" \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" and \\"Right in Two\\" are all instant TooL classics.       The interludes are very TooL-ish and I can take them or leave them.  But that rings true for every TooL album so I'm used to that kind of filler from the band.    Overall, I've obviously become very fond of \\"10,000 Days.\\"  It may not stand up to \\"Aenima,\\" but it's right there with any other TooL release to date.    Now, do we have to wait another 5 years?
B000ETQRCM|5.0|About 80% of the album is really really good, add some great lyrics, and the credibility that they have sustained for several years and you've got an outstanding effort. That's something you won't probably be getting from bands like the strokes in the future.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|first of all, i haven't read much of the previous reviewers, so i cannot comment on them.  i will say that i bought this for two reasons.  partly, simply cause i like the band alot.  secondly, after reading the Guitar World interview with john, i was very anxious to hear what he was talkin bout. <br /> <br />my first reaction of this one, while listening to the highly detailed mixing john did, was WOW.  rather inspiring, creative, soulful stuff.  the production techniques are really amazing.  he drew inspiration from all over, including the voices in his head.  the average listener or critic would probably oversee all this, but if you actually pay attention to the music, you will hear all sorts of overdubbing, backward tracks, and so forth, that really take it to another level.  on top of john's production creativity, his playing is especially soulful.  alot of the time, you barely hear guitar aside from some soft rhythm.  then outa nowhere for a short time, he bursts in with some really powerful notes.  the kind of stuff that ya can really feel.  he has really come a long way, mostly thanks to his newfound spirituality.  definatly inspires my playing. also, the vocals are really solid.  some of the best singin yet, with well placed backing vocals, and vocal effects.  chad's drummin is definatly amazing, as well as flea, of course.  they really click perfectly.  just to throw a song out there, one of my favorites is Especially in Michigan.  it kind of combines everything they can do. <br /> <br />however, with all the initial praise, i do have to say that after listenin to both discs in a row, it gets pretty repetative.  it's almost unneccesary to have 2 discs.  don't get me wrong, 13 bucks for two discs full of great music is quite the deal.  but i'm perfectly satisfied with the jupiter disc.  maybe throw mars in when i've heard jupiter too much, ya know?  anyway, if ya dig any of the chili peppers' stuff, or music with heart, pick this up.  otherwise, stick to your soul-less corperate bands.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Bashing this record just for the prog rock aversion vision, is just plain prejudice, because by now you probably know what you're getting into when buying this record, virtuosity, experimentation, jamming.. etc. <br />That being said, if you have a short attention span, it's obvious you won't like this record, It would be like bahing a ramones record just because there a no guitar solos, or complex song structures. Just listen to the record in the proper context, We all know Omar is one selfish musician, but he has  made a really interesnting effort nevertheless.
B000BGH22W|4.0|This, so far, is the darkest of the HP stories.  I think the music reflects that.  I, personally, think the earlier John Williams melodies for HP are a bit too repetitive but I wouldn't have minded if this album had had a bit more repitition of the HP and Krum/Bulgarian theme. I love how this soundtrack has made the HP theme more full and dark, reflecting how the characters are all growing up.  The last three by \\"The Wierd Sisters\\" though different aren't really all as bad as people seem to be saying.  I really like the last two and it has given me impetus to try out more of this genre if I can find some that has decent lyrics.
0399241515|5.0|Alexander Tate <br /> <br /> This book named Scorpia written by Anthony Horowitz is the second book in the \\"Alex Rider Adventures\\" was an awesome book! It was full of suspense and was an all time thriller. I would give it two thumbs up. It was very amazing how Alex(the main character) did all of these death defying stunts when he was only 14 years old.  <br /> Alex first went to Venice to look for Scorpia, which at the time he had no clue what it was, in order to find the truth about his father. When he finds the truth about his father he falls into a world of hurt, anger, revenge, and dishonesty. In the end though Alex cleared his mind and went back to the good side called MI6. MI6 was a spy program that saves the world and stops Scorpia. Scorpia was an assassin group that was a major terrorist organization that did people's dirty work for them, but at a very high price in money or gold. Alex also had to become friends and trust the person who was the whole leader of the organization of Scorpia. Her name was Mrs. Rothman, a very rich woman who's sidekick was Nile. He was a black belt in karate and in weapons.       <br /> So if you like a James Bond-like adventure that has suspense and thrills you should really read this book and all of the other books in the Alex Rider Adventure series.
B00003OO3O|4.0|When I first bought this on vinyl some twenty years ago, I was not too impressed with it. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because I loved ' Phenomenon ' so much and was disappointed that it didn't sound more like that album. Maybe it's because most of the songs didn't catch on at first listen. Maybe it was the song titles, which I don't think rank amongst their best. Whatever the case was, I remember not liking it that much and foolishly traded it away. Some twenty years later, I bought this on CD and now realize how wrong I first was about this album.<br /><br />Yeah, the songs are not as immediately likable as the tunes from ' Phenomenon ' and the high points aren't as high, but taken on it's own terms, this is a great album. Tunes that didn't catch my ear at first, like the two opening hard rockers, ' Let It Roll ' and  'Shoot Shoot ', I now absolutely love and tunes that I liked the first time around, such as the ballad ' High Flyer ' and the crunchy hard rocker ' Mother Mary ' , I like even more now. This is certainly a more aggressive and heavier album than it's predecessor, but it's also more diverse in terms of material. Keyboards, courtesy of Ten Years After keyboardist Chick Churchill, make their first appearance on a UFO album and definitely add, as opposed to subtract, from the overall sound. The keyboards are at their most effective on the album's closing track, ' This Kid's (including ' Between The Walls '), particularly during the last two and a half minutes. At the moment, this is my favorite song on the album. It fades out with some mournful sounding church (or ' Churchill '!) organ, leaving me wanting more, which is a nice way to end on album.<br /><br />Catchy guitar riffs, singalongable vocal melodies AND guitar solos are in abundance throughout the album, even on what I think are some of the album's weaker cuts such as ' Dance Your Life Away ' and ' Love Lost Love '. Oh yes, and I almost forgot to mention Pete Way's ' Too Much Of Nothing ', which has a very early Alice Cooper-like bass and drum section in the middle. Oh yes..again..I like Andy Parker's very solid drumming on ' Shoot Shoot '. See, there is a bunch to like on ' Force It '! You should buy it!Alice Cooper-like bass and drum section in the middle. Oh yes..again..I like Andy Parker's very solid drumming on ' Shoot Shoot '. See, there is a bunch to like on ' Force It '! You should buy it!
B00025ETIW|4.0|In an Itunes era, it is easy to assume that the best method would be to purchase songs individually. Visit an online store, pick up the singles, save yourself some cash and avoid the filler material.  <br /> <br />My Chemical Romance's sophomore effort is a rare treat in popular rock. \\"I'm Not Okay\\", \\"Helena\\" and \\"Ghost of You\\" are exceptional songs and very well selected singles. However, much of the remaining album is well worth the cash. \\"To the End\\" , \\"Thank You For The Venom\\", \\"Cemetary Drive\\", and \\"I Never Told You What I Do For A Living\\" keep this album worth listening to far longer than I expected. <br /> <br />Many of the songs on the album maintain their aggressive speed and breakneck pace. This is probably the albums only weakness. At the center of the album lies \\"Ghost Of You\\" - no song is easier to relate to or more emotional on the album. However, the album the returns to its breakneck pacing. If the band had included several more tracks along the lines of their central power ballad, the album would have had a more complete feel and a more balanced pace. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album as one of the better efforts released on a major label this year, other than the Rolling Stone's \\"Big Bang\\" release. But often times it felt like I was listening to the first of two cds. This cd focusing on the hardrock they've perfected so well, but missing the tracks that acquire a higher level of emotional resonance such as \\"Ghost of You.\\"
B0000029AL|5.0|This CD is so good and dream on is my favourite song by a-smith of all time.They are the best band in the world and this album along with all their others prove it.Each song on this CD is worth ten stars and it would be worth the price even if it was like 100.00.Awesome CD to go with the best band around.<br /><br />Pick it up along with all of their others.<br /><br />10 Stars!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is the third RHCP's album I've bought, and the best by far. \\"Californication\\" and \\"By the Way\\" were great, but both have some songs that are average at best. \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" despite being a double, 28-song CD, has no filler material. Every song is of high quality and unique in its own way. There is a perfect blend of fast, mid, and slow-tempo songs, as well as many styles. They include slow and mellow, pop-rock, funky, hard rock, and a new style on a few that can only be understood if you were to here it. I'd best describe it as a combination of funk and rock thrown into one song. It's easy to hear that Anthony has improved his vocals over the past four years on this CD. Flea's bass is awesome as usual, and John has taken his already superb guitar skills to a new level throughout the album. Overall just an outstanding piece of work. As a fan I really can't ask them for more.
B00005JNQA|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Considering the level of talent involved in its making (Sean Penn, Nicole Kidman and Catherine Keener in front of the camera and director Sydney Pollack behind), \\"The Interpreter\\" turns out to be a surprisingly dull and lackluster political thriller, one whose attempts at topicality can't make up for the film's extreme over length and tedious plotline.<br /><br />Kidman plays Sylvia, an interpreter working at the U.N., who accidentally overhears what sounds like death threats aimed at an African dictator who is scheduled to deliver a speech before the General Assembly in a few weeks.  Penn and Keener are investigators who begin to suspect that Sylvia may not be quiet the disinterested observer she portrays herself to be in regards to the case.<br /><br />There's nothing overtly wrong with \\"The Interpreter\\" except that it never manages to engage us very fully in either its storyline or its characters.  Everyone involved in the production - from writer to director to actor - seems to be just going through the motions here.  In the inevitable romantic scenes, Penn and Kidman generate zero charisma together, and Keener is essentially wasted in her role as Penn's unsmiling, cynical partner.<br /><br />On second thought, there is one aspect to \\"The Interpreter\\" that might, be deemed offensive by some - and that is the film's willingness to use sensitive topics like genocide and terrorism as mere window dressing for what is, when all is said and done, a pretty lightweight whodunit confection.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|I've been such a huge Alicia fan since she came out and this is a brilliant performance she spills on this stage. It's like you can feel her voice (Not many artist have the capability to do that). She sings with such passion. I love every song on the C.D. I even like how the background singers sung. Everything was amaizing. I wish I could've been there. My Favorite Tracks are:<br /><br />1.Stolen Moments<br /><br />2.If I Aint Got You<br /><br />3.A Woman's Worth<br /><br />4.Fallin<br /><br />5.Streets Of New York<br /><br />But All Of The Songs Were Great.<br /><br />*Alicia Keys Looks Good As Hell Also.................Lol
B000EMGAOY|1.0|RHCP used to be one of my favorite bands.  You can't beat Mother's Milk or Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  I heard reviewers saying the Peppers were going back to their roots and returning to the Mother's Milk sound.  What a joke.  This is more of the slow ballad garbage they put out on the last album.  Where's the funk, the sillyness, and the crazyness that made the band what they were?  Where's the funk-rap?  I can't imagine the Peppers wearing only their tubesocks singing these slow love songs.  I agree with the other reviewers - the RHCP are dead.  I have such fond memories of MM and BSSM.  The only memory I have for this album is it hitting the dumpster.
B0000549B2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I just saw it last week and I decided to go get in DVD. Denzel is the greatest actor of all-time. He didn't dissapoint in this one. Very nice movie!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Hard-driving, nearly punk-style songs, including an amazingly biting anti-war song (World Wide Suicide) combine with some of the most poignant songs (Come Back).  This album is simply amazing and I can't stop listenting to it.  Pearl Jam score big with this one.  It rocks and it's intelligently written.
B000EULJLU|5.0|There was a lot of anticipation and the expectations were high before this album was released.  I mean after you make albums like Aenima and Lateralus which are absolute masterpieces you can be certain that everything that you make will be compared to them.  I mean I doubt that Tool will ever create anything as brilliant as those two albums ever again which is a shame because everything else will be pretty much inferior to them.  10,000 Days is a great album and it has some memorable songs like Rosetta Stoned, Jambi and the title track, 10.00 Days but unfortanetly people expect Tool to produce material as good as their previous two and sad to say, that's not going to happen.  Having said that, this is a good album from one of the best rock bands since Floyd and Zep and definately worth your time.
B000002P72|5.0|One of the first things people notice when listening to B.B. King's Live At The Regal album is that the response of the audience is rapturous, almost like the congregation at a Pentecostal church. There's a reason for this. This is simply the natural response of anyone hearing the King of the Blues at the peak of his powers. <br /> <br />The critic Lester Bangs once wrote that the reason we listen to music in the first place is to hear passion expressed. If this is the case, which I believe it is for most of us, I can think of very few recordings that are more worthy of your time than Live At The Regal. <br /> <br />I was going to continue on about B.B.'s silky-smooth guitar tone on this album, Erick Labson's excellent remastering job on this CD (Wow - those drums sound GREAT!), B.B.'s incredible gift for pacing a show just right, and so forth, but this is all ultimately superfluous. Let me simply say that B.B. King's music transcends genre distinctions - he is simply one of the treasures of American popular music, and this is him at his finest. To paraphrase a commentator I recently heard on NPR, you really have to hate music to not like this.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is one of the mind bogling album. Just listen to the song \\"Storm in a tea cup\\" to realize the supreme power of the great RHCP
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Like most, I enjoyed this album back in the 80's.   \\"Money For Nothing\\" is  great, but I had grown a little tired of it.   Upon picking up Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris' new release \\"All The Roadrunning,\\" I decided to go out and buy this CD.   A nice surprise with a lot of songs I had forgotten about.    \\"Walk of Life\\" is a memorable anthem and the video came back to me, as did the opening song \\"So Far Away.\\" I also think \\"Your Latest Trick\\" is a very good song.  I especially like the saxophone.   However, I believe the best on this CD is the title track \\"Brothers in Arms.\\"    Haunting in its beauty, it is my favorite. I noticed some of the other reviewers did not care much for it.    Give it another listen!   This song was also featured in Season 2 of Miami Vice in the episode \\"Out Where The Buses Don't Run.\\"   Very poignant as it played at the end of the episode.   Just saw the Robert Redford/Brad Pitt thriller \\"Spy Game\\" and there it was again.  \\"Why Worry\\" is also very good.   I had heard the Art Garfunkel version (which I enjoyed), but Mark's take on this is a little different and considerably longer.   And, of course, the unedited version of \\"Money For Nothing\\" makes me realize how much I enjoyed it then and how much I love it now!

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam started out as an amazingly popular seattle grunge band. Over the decade in which they have been popular they have adapted to the changing musical tastes of the culture. And as a seattle band they still keep up with the current seattle scene. This is evident from the track 6, parachutes. The new slow softer type of music that has become big within the last 4 years in seattle. The rest of the cd is signature Pearl Jam. Not as much of the strong grunge, but lets face it the grunge scene is over. Pearl Jam sees that and have just slightly changed there genre from grunge to a more contemporary sound.  <br />    One downside to me is that world wide suicide sounds a little U2-ish. Other than that the cd is great.
B0006L16N8|2.0|If you want to give these guys credit for anything, they certainly deserve credit for taking soft rock all the way to the top again.  They should be called Radioplay because they take basic elements of the Radiohead sound (not the experimentation) and set it to easy-on-the-ears melodies, beats, and lyrics.  \\"Lost in Love\\" has nothing on this one.  I'm actually eagerly anticipating the Coldplay covers album of Air Supply.  \\"All Out of Love\\" with a brittle beat--that will really be something!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I am surprised reading some of the negative reviews for this excellent album.PJ has returned with an album which has seen them returning to their roots and produce a strong album containing classics like Worldwide suicide,Life wasted and Big wave.Buy this with Ten,Vs,Vitalogy and Binaural.
B0000027RL|5.0|I love most of the albums they put out after this one, but Eddie's voice has such a truly desperate edge here.  It's one really nervy guy with a bunch of top-notch musicians backing him up.  \\"Vs.\\" and \\"Vitalogy\\" both have an edge to them, too, but of a different sort.  They just got progressively more comfortable after _Ten_ and had to make their music come from that basis.  This is the chronicle of a young man in an existential crisis who happens to be able to portray it very well.  One of the essential recordings in the history of rock . . . \\"Evenflow,\\" \\"Jeremy,\\" \\"Once,\\" \\"Deep,\\" \\"Garden\\" . . . all of these never fail to provide chills and this is only the beginning of the rewards of this one.

B00001U0E1|5.0|Some dismiss this movie as a chick flick.  I frankly don't see it.  My anti-chick flick sensors didn't activate once during multiple viewings of this film.<br /><br />This is an intelligent, witty, camp film that I seem to find something new to laugh at each time I see it.<br /><br />It definitely helps if you are fan of Shakespeare (read English major) like I am.<br /><br />The action centers around the Rose, one of the leading theaters of the period and the set they use is authentic and despite its simple nature invokes the power of theater.<br /><br />The casting is inspired and each actor sets his teeth into their role with relish.  You can't say too many good things about this cast.  Judy Dench is brilliant as a gnarly old but savvy queen Elizabeth,  Joseph Fiennes is great as a floundering young Will Shakespeare and  Geoffrey Rush is inspired as the tight rope walking theater owner William Hensley.<br /><br />The story line has enough twists and turns to freeze your attention waiting for the next near disaster to fall on top of Will and Hensley whether it be a cuckolded duke, a blood thirsty loan shark with a taste for the theater or the malevolent master of the revelers.<br /><br />Easily among the top ten films that have been made in the last ten years.

B00082IJ08|5.0|In a time when most bands have decided to play it totally safe and become hugely boring by putting out mediocre albums,with a few exceptions of course(namely green day,arcade fire,block party,red hot chilli peppers and the kaiser chiefs)it's really refreshing to have a band(made up of cartoons?)kicking major ass with an album of this caliber.Demon days is not only original,  inspiring and super cool,but is the kind of album that leaves you wondering why other band are so undaring.No fillers here at all and never a dull moment,and what is really amazing is the way mr \\"I got the magic touch\\" Damon Albarn and co.have managed to blend in so many music styles(rock,funk,rap,disco and even a little gospel)and convey them in such a cohesive way.This is truly a gem of an album,and one that will undoubtedly stand the test of time.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I was eager to listen straight through this album as soon as I got it.  To say that I merely enjoyed it would be an understatement.  Throughout the two (that's right, two) CDs, you can feel some things pulled in from previous songs.  Stylistically speaking, I would approximate this to be a mixture of one part Blood Sugar Sex Magik + Californication and two parts By the Way.   <br /> <br />Although I expected more funk tracks, I love what I got.  Unfortunately, though, I can't see any tracks on this album making it to my swim meet psyche-up mix (made up of songs from Blood Sugar and Californication).   <br /> <br />A review that I read online mentioned that this was more of a summation of the Chili Peppers' previous work than an advancement, and I'd have to agree.  It's quite a bit more mellow than things we heard from them ten years ago, and this worked out quite well.   <br /> <br />Anyone else have the insatiable urge to listen to the entire album at once?  This may be the first album that I've ever listened to all the way through multiple times without picking out tracks to skip! <br /> <br />I would VERY HIGHLY recommend Stadium Arcadium.
B00097DXZS|5.0|This is a terrific CD. If like me however, you can only play your CDs on your PC, you need to take the advice to bypass the trojan rootkit installer with the shift button. This is most important. I am not some troller with a vendetta, otherwise I wouldn't be recommending the CD. However if you want the trojan installed, then feel free to let it do it's dirty stuff. If you don't know whether you already have it; or want it removed, there are applications available which purport to do that, such as \\"Resolve\\" disinfector, an 81k ap. I believe MS also have a fix, and ZoneAlarm firewall and AVG anti-virus also have addressed the problem. Some of these CDs have been recalled due to huge backlash, but don't rely on Sony or any other mfr to provide warnings of future trojans, which they've announced their intention to continue with. <br /> <br />One other thing, bands usually have no say over the finished product, and normally are opposed to copy protection & DRM. So don't be holding it against Santana. If bands speak out against it, they might also incur the vengeance of the labels involved. <br /> <br />The music pimps have nothing but contempt for consumers, and only care about control and $$$s
1400062071|2.0|What could have been a wonderful read, and a well-written story, was interspersed with detailed, pornographic accounts of one man's sexual infidelity.

B0000029GA|5.0|First off let me say that I've been a Nas Fan since this album came out in 94. I had never listened to this album,I just remember Whatching the Music Vids for the singles that came out for the album(I was like 8 years old so I wasn't as big a Hip Hop \\"head\\" as I am now). Right off the bat, I new that Nas Was a Great Lyricist. During the Mid 90's their were three MC's that I saw something \\"special\\" in, more so then any other rapper in that era, and those rappers were; Tupac,Biggie, and of course, Nas. As the years went by and my love for Hip Hop grew, so did my respect for Nas. Nowadays, Nas is probably my second favarite rapper, behind Tupac(although Nas is a better Lyricist,Pac is the more Multi-Talented Individual). <br /> <br />  I always meant to Buy Illmatic, but for some reason or another I just kept putting it off. So I Finelly Bought it about A mounth ago. I bumped it all the way threw, from the begining of song 1 to the end of song 10, I listened to it one more time a couple days later, and honestly, I haven't listened to it since. Yes, the album had Amazing Lyrics, Nas had Amazing flow, and the production(for it's time) was superb, but to tell you the truth, I didn't fine this album to be anywhere near as \\"Amazing\\" and \\"Incredible\\" as everyone makes it out to be. Am I saying that the album is Overrated? No. It was a great album, thus the 5 star rating I gave it, however, I do think that the album is a bit Overlly appreciated, as well as Overhyped. Just My Opinion.  <br />
B000056NX5|5.0|There are a lot of things I liked more about this one the the 73 version.  First, it started as a stage musical, and finally there is a movie that makes it feel like a stage musical.  My second comment is one where I can't be sure if it's just better recording technology now than back in the 70s, but all the singers came across as much stronger and much more full.  I've heard people call this version \\"too overdone\\"... yeah, I'd hope the choreography was overdone on a stage musical, it might have been more overdone than the original version, but the original seems like the one over the top sense it was never aiming to be a stage performance.  Oh, and the new Pilate can't be beat, he comes across as extremeley intimmidating and powerful, the old version always seemed week.  The new costumes just prove how well done this musical was written that it can be set to almost any time period and any dress and culture and still be pulled off.  The new Judas shows more emotion, the new Pharisees are more lively, and the new Mary is both a great singer and good looking.  Oh, and if you ever bother watching the special features, this project was done by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim RIce themselves, I'm pretty sure their intentions were kept true.  Oh, and a response to the person complaining that it was unrealistic because Jesus's eyes were the wrong color, get over it, it's a musical, not a church history movie.
B00003CXRM|2.0|This movie appears to be a random mix of themes and genres. It's partly a narrative about Depression era life in the South, partly country-western musical, partly surreal fantasy, partly comedy, partly picaresque adventure, partly indictment of the Klu Klux Klan, partly Dickensian character study - well, the list could go on and on. The result is a scarecrow, a straw man covered in everybody's cast off clothes - out there flapping goofily in the field. <br /> <br />No, I don't understand the point or praise of this one. If you like your movies to be even remotely logical or representative of real life, I don't think you will like it either. <br />
B000FDFVZ6|3.0|the book started out strong and extremely suspenseful but then it got long and drawn out and the end was truly a disappointment.  the story certainly makes you believe there is a heaven, but also makes you wonder if there is really justice here on earth.  it's definitely a story with an original spin.  i would love to hear what others have to say about it.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|At first I wondered, \\"Why remake King Kong again?\\" It's been done several times and never very well (did you see the stinker version with Jessica Lange?). Even though the original 1931 version used stop animation filming for Kong and was in black and white and had cinema's early sound, it is still unquestionably the benchmark version. Even Jackson concedes that. Jackson is humble enough to not have wanted to surpass the original, but rather put forth his own version and have it be judged on its own merits. <br /> <br />I didn't want to like this film. I really didn't. But I do. It's awesome! <br /> <br />Jackson and his talented actors and crew have created a masterpiece of a film that fully engages the viewer. Even though you know what is going to happen if you've ever seen the original, you will be on pins and needles during some of the action sequences. <br /> <br />So realistic is Kong that you fully expect him to really exist. I understand that Andy Serkis \\"played\\" Kong and the gorilla was then animated based on Serkis' movements. Brilliant, simply brilliant! <br /> <br />Naomi Watts is simply marvelous in her Fay Wray role. She brings life and innocence to what could have been an unforgiving role opposite Kong's upstaging. And yet, their scenes together are some of the most brilliant in the film as she and Kong truly seem to connect. My hat is off to Watts (and Serkis if he was participating during the shooting of the scenes together) and Jackson for this ability. <br /> <br />There's no need to rehash the storyline - we all know it. <br /> <br />The cast of actors are all memorable and well cast. I particularly liked Jamie Bell's portrayal of a stowaway-cum-deck hand role and Jack Black (whom I don't usually like) as a scoundrel of a film producer/director. <br /> <br />There are two action sequences during which I was literally holding my breath. One features Kong, Watts, and three huge Allosaurs. Another features the crew of the ship and hundreds of giant size creepy crawlies (if you are bothered by bugs, you'll go insane during this scene). <br /> <br />This is good stuff folks. Get this film!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|First of all, for anyone who is a fan of the more mature Chili Peppers, this album is definately for you.  Secondly, if your a fan of the Flea-tastic bass beat tunes of the Chili Peppers, this album if definately for you.  Last of all, if you like the Chili Peppers that are inbetween, this album is definately for you!  This album combines songs directed at Anthony's voice, John's great guitar work, and unlike By The Way, Flea's back with a vengence. <br /> <br />A huge fan of the chili peppers since I bought their Californication CD.  An even huger fan when I listened to By The Way for nearly a year straight in my car...  It was a hard task to push By The Way out of my \\"Favorite Album of All Time\\" rankings, and this one just about does it.  Like the previous 2 albums, it took a few days to grow on me.  Now that it has, I can predict quite a few hit songs on here (How I predicted dosed, otherside, , universally speaking, and parallel universe to be hits)   <br /> <br />Hits on this track: <br />*Dani California (actually my least favorite hit) <br />*Snow (Hey Oh) <br />*Stadium Arcadium - Every once in a while they decide to get serious and sing lyrics that halfway make sense (or arn't encoded with meaning)...this is one of them.   <br />*Hard to Concentrate <br /> <br />And my personal favorites which  have a wonderful tune: <br />*Snow (Hey Oh) <br />*Only in Michigan <br />*If <br />*hard to Concentrate <br />*Death of a Martian <br /> <br />Overall this album is going to keep the chili peppers on the charts for at least a year.
B000EULJLU|2.0|This album starts off great with Vicarious and Jambi, then pretty much goes downhill from there, until Right In Two. The rest is mediocre at best (The Pot, Rosetta Stoned), or just plain garbage (Wings for Marie, Lipan Conjuring, Lost Keys, Viginti Tres).    For me, Tool has always shown a progression, or evolution to their music. And it has always made some kind of emotional statement to me, a connection. I personally and not finding either in this album.      It really pains me to be writing this, as I wanted to give this 5 stars, as I would every other Tool album. Unfortunatly, this album does not merit it.     That having been said, the packaging of this album is friggin incredible. The artwork is amazing, and alone is worth the money.
6301966562|5.0|I first saw \\"Electric Dreams\\" when I was 10 years old.  Computers were a rather new concept.  If I remember correctly, we had a little exposure at school...playing math games and such on them. The thought of a computer becoming obsessed with it's owner, having a mind of it's own and having the ability to cause havoc was thrilling during the time!  I found this movie very entertaining.  It's one of those that you can watch over and over.  Although a bit cheesy, I loved it!  I hope that it will one day be released on DVD!  In addition, the soundtrack is AWESOME!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I love this series!  The pilot on this set is great.  It really sets the tone for the whole series.  Episode 2 is wonderful, too because you get to see Suki at her clumsiest.  If you like this series, GET the DVDs.  It's still funny the second, third, fourth, fifth, etc time you watch it.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Tool is one of the most musically progressive and talented group of individuals out there. BUT they have not had practice working as a creative unit and it shows badly on this album. Rather than feeling like the masterpiece it should be, after a five year haitus, 10,000 Days feels more like a collection of Lateralus b-sides. The Tool formula has altered little from their previous album. This grieves me because each release since Opiate has had massive progressions in their sound, accept this one. <br /> <br />The only reason the album recieves more than two stars is the fact that Maynard has become somewhat more personal in his lyrical aproach, proof that his stint with A Perfect Circle has at least given him time to grow as a writer, even if his vocal expression tends to stay somewhat static throughout this album. <br /> <br />I wish I could say more, but I'm dissapointed.
B000E1OI7G|5.0|Sure, the brits may have done a fine job on there show, but Traffic is one of the better films to come out since 2000. The film has a haunting quality that is starting to resonate more and more in today's society.
1573301183|5.0|Thank God AIC agreeed to do this show!  Whenever I need to listen to some REAL music and someone who can actually SING, I can just pop this DVD in.  Without a doubt, Layne Staley had THE most unique and beautiful voice I've ever heard.  Quite a few have commented on his deteriorating appearance in this show.  To me, this man was then and will ALWAYS be beautiful!   <br /> <br />You will definitely get your money's worth with this one!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Silence speaks louder than words... Love speaks louder than words ...     I'm a university professor and I tend to consider myself as a rather rational-intellectual and somewhat stoic person... but then came Brokeback Mountain which caught me off guard and has generated in me unforeseen emotion.     Brokeback Mountain is at once the most lyrical, powerful, inspirational, yet heart-wrenching film in a long time, without doubt one of the most important and greatest films of the last few decades. This is truly an exceptional achievement, a landmark film with an amazing story/script, outstanding and exceptional acting, masterful direction, unhurried and controlled pace, breathtaking cinematography, simple yet excellent and beautiful music, and most importantly, unprecedented emotional impact. Its treatment of human nature, loneliness, longing for love, self-repression, intolerance, is done with admirable subtlety and sensitivity. This story is simply universal. Images of this film and stirring emotions will haunt you for days and weeks.  This is an extraordinary deeply moving film... simply unforgettable!     Brokeback Mountain is a rare work of art in which silence speaks louder than words. Eyes and smiles can be very eloquent. Sometimes words are not necessary and are simply obstacles to the truest expression. Ennis's visit to Jack's room near the end of the film is a scene in total silence: he is alone and no word is uttered. Yet, this is surely one the most powerful and probably one of the most unforgettable scenes in recent cinematic history for its meaning and emotional impact... love speaks louder than words. Ang Lee realizes the full power of image in his exploration of the most intimate human emotions. Avoiding facile and superficial stereotypes, the great author Annie Proulx and director Ang Lee have created truer-than-life characters and, thanks of course to the unforgettable and heartbreaking performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, \\"Ennis and Jack\\"now live forever, they are now undeniably part of the American literary and cinematic culture. How many other films have accomplished this in recent years?     Brokeback Mountain will remain a milestone in cinematic history and is already considered a \\"reference\\". This film has been talked about all over the world and has attained unprecedented internationally acclaim - the \\"Brokeback phenomenon\\" has significantly crossed borders and, through the media and the Internet, has reached numerous foreign countries. Rarely did a film have such a strong impact on society, in the media, and with the general public. Brokeback Mountain has undeniably been the \\"Most Acclaimed and Honoured Film\\" of 2005 (and, as a matter of fact, of the last decade) and will of course be remembered as \\"THE\\" movie-event and most important film of 2005 despite the inexplicable absence of an Oscar for Best Picture to its already impressive crown.     It's sad to say, but the recent disgraceful Oscar scandal proved how \\"important\\" and \\"necessary\\" this film is, and how many boundaries there are still to be conquered. After receiving dozens of prestigious awards worldwide, Brokeback Mountain might have been too subtle, too true, simply \\"too good\\", for the LA-based Academy... yes, the more I think of it, the feelings expressed in BBM are probably much too sincere and too profound for the Hollywood peanut gallery who often seems to prefer car crashes, car chases, explosions, fire, violence, rape, theft, gun shots, murders, etc. In any case, the newly released DVD of Brokeback will stand as a permanent reminder of how great this film is and how unimportant, irrelevant and meaningless the Oscars and the Academy really are.      Countless people from all walks of life around the world will never forget Brokeback Mountain. This film is not pushing a specific moral, instead, it makes us think, it makes us feel, it makes us reflect on the true meaning and value of our lives.    If you haven't seen this filmyet, get the DVD, enjoy this truly exceptional masterpiece, and \\"live the Brokeback Mountain experience\\"!
B000000OAH|4.0|This album contains some of Queen's greatest tracks-the rollicking Fat Bottomed Girls , Bicycle Race and one of my favourite Queen songs-Don't Stop Me Now.<br />Also noteworthy are the fast paced Let Me Entertain You and Fun It , the melancholy Leaving Home Ain't Easy and Jealousy , the Middle Eastern style  Mustapha and the waltzing 50's style Dreamer's Ball.<br />An excellent album featuring a very important stage in the bands development.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|THE BAND: Billy Gibbons (guitars, vocals, hermonica, fiddle, baritone sax, keyboards), Dusty Hill (bass, vocals, tenor sax, keyboards), Frank Beard (drums, percussion, vocals, alto sax). Bill Ham (manager, producer, inspiration).<br /><br />THE DISCS: (2004) 38 tracks on two discs clocking in at approximately 154 minutes (78+ on Disc-1, 75+ on Disc-2). Included with the discs is an 18-page booklet containing a 12 pages of history and retrospective on the band, song titles/credits and chart success, assorted pictures, what songs came from which albums; 14 album covers pictured on 1 page, and thank you's. Digitally remastered sound. Label - Warner Bros.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: ZZ Top's First Album (3), Rio Grande Mud (3), Tres Hombres (4), Fandango! (5), Tejas (2), Deguello (4), El Loco (2), Eliminator (4), Afterburner (5), Recycler (2), Greatest Hits (1), Promo Singles (3).<br /><br />COMMENTS: 30+ years and still chugging along. ZZ Top has proven it's ability to rock & roll over the years. Complete with their trademark Texas-blues fused rock, overly long beards, (probably not cheap) sunglasses, love of fast hot rods, and seemingly countless videos on MTV. The liner notes are extensive in regards to the birth of the band - touching on family, teenage garage bands (The Moving Sidewalks & The Warlocks), running into producer Bill Ham (backstage at a Doors concert), first gig (1970), opening  shows for Jimi Hendrix, etc. Outside of the 4-disc box set that's overly priced - as of 2004 this is now the best ZZ Top compilation available. The two other most notable 'best of' pacakges are now expendable. 9 of 10 songs are here on \\"Rancho Texicano\\" from ZZ Top's first 'Best Of' compilation (1977)... only song missing is \\"No Back Door Love Affair\\". 15 of the 18 songs off ZZ Top's \\"Greatest Hits (1992) are here as well (missing are \\"Gun Love\\", \\"Give It Up\\" and \\"Planet Of Women\\"). All of the omissions are OK in my book. The only songs I would have removed from \\"Rancho\\" would be \\"Mexican Blackbird\\" and \\"Woke Up With Wood\\"... and replaced them with the strangely absent \\"TV Dinners\\" and/or \\"Concrete And Steel\\". Overall though, the 38 songs are simply dead on accurate. All songs are the original studio versions except the last 2 dance remixes of \\"Legs\\" and \\"Velcro Fly\\" (you do however get the original versions of these 2 songs earlier on the disc), and 2 live songs (\\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" and \\"Thunderbird\\"). Anyone else find it interesting when reading the liner notes, that Billy, Frank, and Dusty all play the saxophone? Every rock & roll collection needs some ZZ TOP and this is the ideal place to start. Great set of discs (5 stars).ird\\" and \\"Woke Up With Wood\\"... and replaced them with the strangely absent \\"TV Dinners\\" and/or \\"Concrete And Steel\\".

0553801503|4.0|I really enjoyed the ways in which this 4'th volume diverged from the previous 3. I'm a little puzzled at the criticisms from other fans of the series, because its really very similar in strengths and weaknesses, it just focuses on different locales. I continued to find the characters fascinating, and liked the way the storyline is advanced by different characters. Yes, there are some caricatures - Cersei, for example is over the top, but that's ok in this genre. This volume was particularly strong in providing background for the different realms and societies of Westeros, like the militancy of the Seven Gods worshippers, all very imaginative. I do keep thinking of GRR Martin as a high level D&D DM. It certainly kept me reading obsessively, and wanting to go on to the next volume.
B000001ELF|5.0|THE BAND: Ace Frehley (lead/rhythm/acoustic guitars, bass, lead and backing vocals). Ace didn't have a band per say, but several studio session players helping him out - including Anton Fig (drums & percussion), Will Lee (bass), and Carl Tallarico (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1978) 9 songs clocking in at approximately 37 minutes. Included with the disc is a 2-page foldout with song titles/credits, musicians, and thank you's. Recorded at The Mansion in Sharon, CT. All songs written or co-written by Ace Frehley, except \\"New York Groove\\" (written by Russ Ballard, best known for his solo career and his years with Argent). Label - Casablanca. In 1997, Mercury (label) has digitally remastered most of the early Kiss releases including each of their solo albums from '78.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I always loved Ace's solo album the most (of the four). It had two of the best songs (\\"Rip It Out\\" and \\"New York Groove\\")... and it simply rocked the hardest out of the four. \\"Rip It Out\\" was such a heavy song featuring some brilliant guitar work... but it also featured amazing drums by Anton Fig. Fig is a master drummer and it was a huge bonus for Ace to score him on his solo album. Fig has a huge resume and has been an important session player for so many top artists of the time (Bob Dylan, Journey, Kiss, Peter Frampton, Mick Jagger, Billy Joel, Warren Zevon, Billy Squier, Joe Satriani, etc)... as well as being the drummer for David Letterman's \\"Late Show\\" with Paul Schafer. \\"Speedin' Back To My Baby\\" provided a nice 1-2 punch to start the album. \\"Snow Blind\\" and \\"Ozone\\" were songs about accesses and addictions and possibly self taught experiences from the 'Spaceman' himself. \\"What's On Your Mind?\\" is a great rock song leaning toward the more pop side. \\"New York Groove\\" was the highest charting song (#20) of any of the Kiss solo albums. Being raised near NYC, I heard this song on the radio all the time - and it was very deserving. \\"Fractured Mirror\\" might be the real gem on the album... the instrumental has a nice blend of acoustic and electric guitars. Ace Frehley also proved he was a capable singer. Great disc.album... the instrumental has a nice blend of acoustic and electric guitars. Ace Frehley also proved he was a capable singer. Great disc.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Anyone who has a name like Starwars Fan shouldn't be reviewing music in the first place... if you're so in love with star wars and you don't think anything after bloodsugarsexmagik was good you need to pull your head out of your pompous 'i'm better than you' ass. the red hot chili peppers are one of the best rock bands ever formed. they have influenced all sorts of artists including another great band, 311. there have been dozens and dozens of known bands that attribute their sound at least in part to the chili peppers. this cd is one of their best and deserves a place in the best they've ever done. unlike bands like aerosmith and bon jovi and motley crue this band can still play. when you've been around as long as them and you can still put out music that is as creative and great as they did here... you belong in the history books as one of the best ever. so don't listen to star wars boy and get this cd... the best money you can spend right now.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Being an avid music fan, you can find me with headphones on at least 5 hours a day.  Most of my time at work is spent at a desk with headphones on and, without a doubt, these are the best bang for the buck. <br /> <br />These headphones are meant for portability.  So if you plan on using your headphones with a portable cd player, fm tuner, mp3 player, etc. then life doesn't get any better than with these.  Otherwise, you will probably need to purchase an extension cord to go along with them. <br /> <br />The sound is perfect for your average person, and they are unbreakable.  Well... almost. The cord will often get loose at a joint somewhere, so you will need to plan on buying a new pair once every 9 months or so if you use your headphones often.  But, unless you are jerking on the cords in an unnatural way, you cannot break these.  Bend them anyway you want, and they immediately return to their original shape. <br /> <br />If you are going to wear a pair of headphones for extended periods of time, you will probably want the following features: <br /> <br />ultra-light, <br />flexible/unbreakable, <br />good sound, <br />stays on your head (even if you take the buds out of your ears), or hangs around neck, <br />and are cheap enough that you don't mind buying a pair once or twice a year. <br /> <br />Honestly, there are times when my music has been paused for a short period of time and I have to touch my ears to see if I even have the headphones on.  They are *that* comfortable.  I buy three at a time so that I have a backup and I can give a pair away to a friend who I see wearing poor sounding or uncomfortable headphones that usually come default with their device (ahem, ipod).
B00005O3VD|4.0|Funny Girl is an old fashioned musical telling an old fashioned story. The real life star was Fanny Brice, played by Barbra Streisand. The songs are fantastic ( especially My Man and Don?t Rain on my Parade) and the costumes are full of life and color. Omar Shariff is dashing as Nick Arnstein, the gambler husband. Walter Pidgeon is good as Folrenz Ziegfeld. Anne Francis has a small part as Fanny?s showgirl friend. Personally, I would have wanted her role to be a little larger.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|\\"Wet Sand\\" and \\"Desecration Smile\\" may be two of the best songs that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have ever done.  by the way (pun intended) I find another masterpiece every time I listen.  ( I was there when BSSM made history a long time ago, and I have many memories with  OHM, CALI and BTW)  WOW! Rock on..................
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool never ceases to amaze me. They must have all these outside voices tempting them to make an Aenema 2 or another Lateralus, but as usual they do it their way. They make music they enjoy making, when they want to make it ( or perhaps, like their heroes the equally Briiliant King crimson, when they feel its neccessary). They dont cave in to the enormous pressure of Record Labels or worry and fret about the  short attention span of supposed \\"Fans\\" and I applaud  them for that. <br /> <br />With that out of the way I have to say this is to me the definite Tool album, it seems to encompass all their previous work and expand it to new heights. Powerful, dense, Intelligent and focused 10,000 days shines with an almost at times improvished feel to it, that will take repeated but worthwhile listens to fully grasp. An absolute amazing album to immerse yourself in check out: Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot,Intension, Right in Two, Rosetta Stoned
0451526643|3.0|This novel pretty much hits you over the head with its message, which is that people have to have some purpose in their lives (besides being rich and beautiful). <br /> <br />Fitzgerald's protagonist, Anthony Patch, is a young man of leisure who expects to inherit substantial wealth one day.  He marries a beautiful nihilist, Gloria, and lives a life of pleasure seeking with her until he becomes an alcoholic and approaches his ruin.  He's a mean drunk, too, and in case the reader has any remaining sympathy for him, Fitzgerald has him tell a story about once kicking a kitten. <br /> <br />While it is beautifully written, and probably has value as a cautionary tale, more subtlety would have made this a better novel.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Chili Peppers have been making music since before I was born and yet, as you can hear in this new double album, they just get better and better with time. For me, songs like \\"Snow\\" and \\"Hard to Concentrate\\" are as beautiful as music gets. I hope they never stop making music.
B00005ATQF|5.0|I can't count the times at work or elsewhere I have heard a group of guys exchanging one-liners from this film. Act I or act II the dialouge itself is tremendous, as is the movie.    I had researched the availability of this title on widescreen and have found that the standard version that is available is the theatrical widescreen. On the dvd release you are actually seeing more of the picture than what was shown in the theatrical release. If you want to see it as it was shown in theaters cover the top and bottom two inches of your screen for an approximate 1:85 aspect ratio. These 'bars' were removed for dvd release.    There will never be a 'widescreen' release of this film as the standard version is that release. The aspect ratio is 1:33 but this is not a pan and scan.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|i have always been a zombie fan. however when i first heard \\"foxy, Foxy\\" i was a bit put off by the lack of composition. i have since found that the hectic sound is great to listen to while working out. as fo the rest of the album, i love it.
1592402038|4.0|I found it funny and enjoyable. This is subjective I realize, but I don't find much all that amusing these days, and in spite of an unavoidable pedantic tone (still not nearly so harsh and condescending as say, Fowler) at times- I thought Truss hit a homerun.<br />The book is bright, quick and informative, and the puns were kept to a minimum. Granted it had a bit of that NPR humor (National Public Radio in the U.S.) which can grate, but the bone dry English wit compensated. There was also a lot of helpful information. As an example, I'm always at a bit of a loss with semi-colons myself, and Truss does some good work at pointing out why they are still around and how to use them properly (and wrongly). She doesn't persuade me to cut back on the dash use- she points out that it is difficult to use wrongly which I find a strength rather than a weakness. If the goal is to clarify, as is the central theme of the book, then whatever is simplest and best seems to me the way to go. If the semi-colon must go the way of the buggy-whip, the sooner the better for me. Still, a well-placed semi-colon is mighty impressive, all the more so for its near-anachronistic quality.<br /><br />A short but fun read on a subject difficult to make fun. I'm hoping she comes out with a longer book on grammar some day. I give it 4+ stars.
068987474X|5.0|This book is fabulous.  I got the audio CD and I'm listening to it for the second time now.  It will make you laugh out loud!!!  I'd highly recommend it for anyone who is single and agonizing over all kinds of excuses that people give.  I agree with a previous reviewer.  This book isn't just for women.  When I listened to it, I sounded like some of the excuses and thought, wow, Greg's right.  I just wasn't really into that boyfriend!  :-)
B000EMGAOY|4.0|If you liked Californication you will love this one. Not every track is great, but I can basically listen to both cd's all the way through and enjoy it. There are some great sounding tracks on this album and if u are a fan u will enjoy it. CD 2 is a little better than CD 1 IMO but thats for u to decide. I dont know what these people are thinking who just blatenly say this album sucks. Buy it, and just sit back and enjoy
B000EMGAOY|2.0|For all of you who were looking forward to a chili peppers album that goes back to their funky roots like Mother's Milk and such older albums, prepare for dissappointment because the new cd is mostly slow, generic, pop-rock, failing to bring out the musical talent that the band actually has.  Simple beats by Chad Smith and basslines using root notes for one of the best bassists isn't cutting it....this album deserves a two at the highest
B000002KB8|5.0|Seriously.  I am.  Now I don't understand why people review cd's.  I came on to this site casue I wanted to see what people thought of kung fu from various parts of the country and world.  What I found out is thta there are really no die hards in here, I decided to review all that I have seen, and I have seen many.  So whenever I saw a review that I like I would click on the rest of their reviews and see that everybody reviews cd's.  Or I would see that it is a top reviwer and click on their stuff and would literally see that they only reviewed this one movie of the genre.  And too often their review is a replica of one on kungfucinema.com.  That is truly unfortuante, when talking about a movie, you are seeing and hearing it, big difference.  The images blended with sounds, acting, production values, costumes, etc. You can comment on the special features, you can tell how good the sound and picture is, and say if it is widescreened.  What do you do with a cd, say that it plays?  So everybody who hates this cd, if you actually made it through all of those words, than stop, put your not helpful vote here, and leave.  You do not know music.<br /><br />So if I am seriously going to review a cd, review then I will only do like 2 or 3, the ones that make you FEEL their music and the ones that make you think that they understand your life when the music plays.  It is nice to close your eyes and listen to the music and imagine what the world could be like.  Now this music is for everybody but even better for people who like to think and do NOT LIKE THINGS THAT ARE LINEAR.  If you are expecting to hear a song that is supposed to just fit in with the rest of the junk you hear on the radio nowadays, give your cd to me, I will copy it and copy it and continue to leave this cd everywhere I think people may pick it up.<br /><br />Now since this is the best album of all time I will actually review it.  I used to just come on this site and say yeah, that movie is good.  Then I figured out that I am the first person to review it literally half of the time.  I am only doing a few reiews on cd's so if you like this and ask me to do more, than do not ask me, it is retarded, and I will not do it.<br /><br />track #1-  this is black sabbath.  I cannot say that this is my favorite song by them, but it is their best.  Name me a better song that represents what black sabbath is truer than this.<br /><br />track #2- the wizard is a very unique song.  Though only a handful of sabbath songs could be considered  not original, this one still stands out from the rest.  The way ozzy is so intune with the harmonica to tony's guitar should truly inspire anybody wanting to have a band, which of course has happened or music would proabbaly have just stopped in the 80's.<br /><br />track #3-first half is the makes it the the least powerful song on the album, but still nice to chill to.  But nib is the second half and I still haven't figured what the hell this song is about.  But it is a nice tune.<br /><br />track #4-my favorite song for like 5 years, seriously.  Anybody who comments on how the sound is all distorted, well that is how tony tunes his guitar, and once again sabbath haters, this album is UNIQUE.  So go wait for creed's next album to come out or, sorry I just am not able to to name any good new bands, they all suck but go away fast enough for me.  Except those dam dave mathews songs.  That dud sucks.  Listen to this song some time if you want to hear a band that can really play music.  And fans of the guitar genre, you wil like this, I promise the distortion will influence you and what you listen to.<br /><br />track 5- this is my fav ever.  It seems like a lot of different songs mixed together, but always somehow finds it's way back to the main chorus.  I honestly feel like I am in another  universe when playing this track.  Now this cd has honestly been in my car cd player for well over a year straight.  Before that, it was in their for like 4 years straight.  And still, i just need ot hear it sometimes to make me feel ok again.<br /><br />So don't think that this is literally all I listen to, but I don't have much variety.  Sure many othres were great, zepillin, the beatles, but bands like sabbath and hendrix in his small time are everlasting.<br /><br />BTW- sabbath fans, I pretty much hate all new music.  But check out this movie called rekka deadly outlaw.  It is worth the buy for the music alone.  I forget their name but they are truly japan's black sabbath.ar it sometimes to make me feel ok again.      So don't think that this is literally all I listen to, but I don't have much variety.  Sure many othres were great, zepillin, the beatles, but bands like sabbath and hendrix in his small time are everlasting.      BTW- sabbath fans, I pretty much hate all new music.

B000002MUW|5.0|Bedtimes Stories and Erotica are two of Madonna's best albums.They both were underated.Bedtimes Stories sold well,it sold about 3 million in the US..thats nothing compared to her Like A Virgin(10 Million) and True Blue (8 million)albums,but this album is very good.The best track on here is Human Nature,which oddly missed the Top 40,peaking at #46.Other highlights include Survival,Secret,and Take A Bow.This album should have suceeded.I believe this is far from her worst album. Actually her worst album recorded in my opinion,would have to be \\"Music\\" with the exception of \\"Don't Tell Me\\". Make sure you pick up a copy of this album.    Charts  Album  Bedtime Stories #3......3 platinum    Singles  Secret #3  Take A Bow #1(7 weeks)  Human Nature #46  Bedtime Story #42
B00000IQV7|5.0|Robin Williams is one of those rare super successful comedians who can take a barebones script and fill it with all sorts of fun-ness, hilarity, and jovialocularity that soon, the barebones script transforms into a morbidly obese, oddly smelling dude who rings your doorbell at dinnertime on a weeknight and offers to cut your grass \\"for $10 less than the guy who's doing it now.\\"<br /><br />Patch Adams is almost the perfect Robin Williams vehicle. A more perfect vehicle for Robin would be some sort of school bus with him way in the back and a bunch of fabulous guys (pharmacuetical sales, commercial real estate or possibly children talent agents) talking on their cell phones and admiring their platinum bracelets that look so good with their slicked back hair. You know what I'm talking about. Well, that vehicle is driven by some sort of small monkey on a mountainous highway. And instead of paying attention to the road, the monkey is distracted by the glare of all the platinum bracelets and plunges into the Caspian Sea and all are lost. To me, that is the perfect vehicle for Robin Williams.
B00000273M|5.0|The Bangles are great group that never goes out of style...I remember as a child purchasing the Manic Monday 45rpm.....and I played it over and over......When this was released..I bought it and of course all the hits are here....Standouts are If She Knew What She Wants,Manic Monday,Eternal Flame,In Your Room,Walk Like An Egyptian,Walking Down Your Street,A Hazy Shade Of Winter,and Be With You...........MAKE SURE YOU GET A COPY OF THIS GREAT ALBUM FROM A GREAT GROUP!
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I really expected this movie to blow me away. Unfortunately, It didn't. Yes, there are great special affects and storm(my favorite) finally gets a chance to fly, but she doesn't do much of anything else. I really expected storm to shine in this movie, but once again she left something to be desired. I guess I am expecting the characters to be more like the animated version of the x-men that aired on fox in the 90's. Another major flaw is having two main characters killed off. I mean come on folks, cyclops and the professor are key characters.And once again it's wolverine that saves the day. I don't have a beef against wolverine but having him take out a powerful mutant like the phoenix is just stretching it a little. I can see maybe the professor or magneto or maybe even storm, but wolverine. He gets way to much credit as far as I'm concerned. Magneto really shows his stuff in this one and so does Pyro,everyone else just sort of tags along for the ride. That is except for wolverine who always has to be the hero. Sorry, folks but if there's going to be an x-men 4 they had better bring it. I hope they include the most powerful and evil super villian ever (Apocalypse)!!
B000002MFN|5.0|Erotica is a great album.It was very underated.I don't see how,maybe the Sex Book was too much?

B00005JNQS|3.0|A lighthearted, occassionally funny film that suffers from a simple plotline and an one-joke premise. Robin Williams is OK, but (I can't believe I'm saying this) insufficiently manic. CGI does look great--what better arena for its shiny surfaces than robots? <br /> <br />Good for young kids, but anyone over 13 will be bored.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|The Robocop movies are the best sci fi movie out there. the first 2 (espicly 2) had lots (and i mean lots, its like skulls getting cut open and limbs shot off entirly) of blood and gore. now i do remember being a kid and watching the 3rd and after that i checked out the second then the first and man the 3rd dosent compair to the first 2. but my favroite Robocop movie has to be number 2 cuse of how dirty and gory it was. Frank Miller really needs to get a Directers Cut of number 2 out there cuse as i understand alot was cut from that movie it just nees more cuse it leaves you wantin more but in a good way. these movies are classics and will never die out and frankly the terminator just keeps getting worse as the movies progress.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars is the story of a young man (Luke Skywalker) who in just one day's time goes on an incredible and unbelievable adventure of a lifetime, exploring the depths of outer space, confronting terrible evil, and prevailing against a machine designed for terror and destruction. <br />     George Lucas' first Star Wars film \\"A New Hope\\" is one of the best movies of all time, but it is also one of the most unbelievable, and succeeds at suspending one's disbelief.  As one example, Luke Skywalker leaves his home planet on board the Millennium Falcon, a space ship about the size of a basketball court.  While traveling through space the Falcon provides its passengers with \\"Earth-like\\" gravity, always keeping their feet firmly planted on the floor.   <br />     Another example of how well Star Wars \\"suspends disbelief\\" revolves around the story's main plot line: that a small, manmade, metal moon has been designed by the evil empire in order to keep control of all its imperial possessions through the threat of terrible force.  The empire's \\"Death Star\\" moon is equipped with enough fire power to destroy a planet, and early on in the movie it does fire a death ray that completely obliterates a whole planet.  The problem is that the Death Star is a moon.  If the empire wants to go destroy a planet it has to go \\"hover\\" over to some region of the galaxy where it can then fire its guns.  Traveling at the speed of light, it would take about 4 years for someone on Earth to reach the next closest solar system to our Sun.  The Death Star does not travel at the speed of light.  It hovers.  If the Death Star hovered at a considerable rate of thousands of miles per hour, that would still be only a tiny fraction of the speed of light.  When the Falcon escapes the Death Star, because \\"the old man got the tractor beam out of commission,\\" the space ship blasts off into hyper space, traveling a tremendous distance in a short amount of time to reach the Rebel base.  Then, in hot pursuit, comes the Death Star, \\"hovering\\" after Luke, Leia, and Han in the Falcon.  That very same day the Death Star catches up to the Falcon at the Rebel base.  Luke, a farm boy from an insignificant corner of the universe, is entrusted by the Rebels and gets equipped with one of the Alliance's X-Wing fighters so that he can go destroy the Death Star before it destroys the Rebel base.  And as the Death Star makes its final approach to the Rebels' planet, the evil imperial lord Darth Vader says, \\"This will be a day long remembered.  We have seen the end of Kenobi.  We shall soon see the end of the Rebellion.\\"  The key word is \\"day.\\"  This whole Star Wars adventure took place in just one day.  So the Death Star covered many millions, or perhaps many billions of miles, in a fraction of a day.  Conquering this impossibility of reality is really what make Star Wars so great.  The plot features the triumph of good over evil.  The cinematography features the triumph of science fiction over physics. <br />Review by: Adam Platts <br /> <br />
0385338082|5.0|\\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" was such fun to read.  I read the entire book in one day!  The reading is very light, quick and entertaining. I think this book would make a very cute chick flick movie!  I hope they do that!
B000007NYS|5.0|This self-titled release by Lucinda Williams is still her best album as a whole. Every song is a gem and all the songs fit together nicely as a whole. I loved this cd so much I bought it on both cassette and cd when it originally came out. The tape died a long time ago, but the cd is still holding up well. Note that the original release of this album had 12 tracks on it. Any tracks tacked on after that are extras that were not part of the original song sequence.
B000E0OBK6|5.0|Jarhead is a masterpiece about the NEW kind of war--the wars we are fighting now. Wars for which we train our 20 year-old troops to fight World War II again (with a few new wrinkles). Here is a true  story of marine snipers, superbly trained to kill, not to think, not to read, not to medidate. We then put them in the desert for 6 months (in 1990) with nothing to do . It is only surprising they didn't go even crazier. <br />Then they run around in the desert, second fiddle forever to political tactics and high-speed bombers (who provide friendly fire for entertainment). Think of this film as \\"Prelude to Baghdad 2006\\" and try to imagine these same kids in downtown Baghdad, terrifying, both for them and for Americans who want American policy to treat our soldeirs like humans---and the citizens of other countries like humans.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Not only is this the worst version of this story that I have ever seen, but it is the worst movie I have seen in a long time.  And I just saw \\"Uptown Girls.\\"
0743454537|3.0|I first discovered Jodi Picoult when a friend loaned me her copy of \\"Keeping Faith\\". I loved the book and have also read her latest \\"Tenth Circle\\". I have just finished \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" and I have to say that this was my last Jodi Picoult read. The way she moves from one character to another with each chapter is monotonous and never really pulls them together. I kept waiting for the story to \\"start\\". I was intrigued by the premise and therefore very disappointed in the way it was handled. I thought the ending was a cheap shot. It was as if she couldn't figure out how it should end, so she just killed off the main character! As I said, after Tenth Circle and now this one, I am ready to move on to other authors. Sorry!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I bought this film based solely on the rave reviews on Amazon--a first for me--and I am SO glad I did! If you love Pride and Prejudice and other BBC mini-series, you will love this movie. A bit darker than Wives and Daughters by Elizabeth Gaskell, North and South depicts the conditions of cotton mill workers in industrialized England and the tensions between classes at the time. Richard Armitage gives an outstanding performance as Mr. Thornton. If you like the dark and brooding types (ala Colin Firth, who will always hold a special place in my heart), you'll definitely sigh over him! And the ending--yes, it's changed from the book and is perhaps unrealistic--is very satisfying and romantic! I only wish Gaskell had written more so the movie didn't have to end. For all BBC and P&P lovers, watch this movie--you won't be disappointed.
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|This band is so influenced by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath they might as well haved named themselves \\"Black Zeppelin\\". The singer should just admit he's imitating R. Plant. <br />  <br />That being said, it's not horrible. It's fun to listen to.. as long as you know that you're gonna hear Black Zeppelin on every track... <br /> <br />...Except for the inexplicable 2 song departure from the rest of the album:  <br />The track \\"Apple Tree\\" sounds so much like the White Stripes, I think they stole Jack's notebook-- and right after that \\"Joker & the Thief\\" which sounds like: if Jack White & the Who made a song together. The opening is such a ripoff of \\"Baba O'Riley\\", I'm surprised they're not being sued by the Who.  <br /> <br />Other than that... Black Zeppelin... not bad, nothing original. <br /> <br />*By the way, if Zeppelin & Sabbath never existed, there would BE NO Wolfmother.
B0002LU8OU|4.0|With its debonair lyrics and cool arrangements this is the first Lloyd Cole album to listen to. Perfect Skin, Forest Fire and Rattlesnakes made a classic debut set of superb singles, and Are You Ready To Be Heartbroken? could easily have been a fourth (an earlier version nearly became their first single and is included on the second disc).<br /><br />Much is made of the cinematic and literary references, but far from being pretentious this seems an accurate reflection of the kinds of allusions made in normal conversations of the time. According to the illuminating sleeve notes to which all the band contribute, Julie Burchill remarked in her album review that she had no use for a country and western Velvet Underground, showing that she was as off-target regarding the Commotions as she was on everything else.<br /><br />Although the album has been re-issued before with B-sides as bonus tracks, this time the original album is the sole incumbent of disc one and so there is a natural close at the album's end, enabling it to be enjoyed as an entity.<br /><br />The second disc gathers together all the B-sides from the 7\\" and 12\\" versions of the three singles: The Sea And The Sand/You Will Never Be No Good from Perfect Skin; Andy's Babies (about Warhol's Factory acolytes) and Glory (a Television cover) from Forest Fire. Sweetness was thought by the band to be too good to be a B-side but at the time was hurriedly recorded in Wales while they were touring, when they needed something to back the Rattlesnakes single (the single's third track, Four Flights Up, was taken from the album). Jesus Said was recorded in Islington in early 1985 with Paul Hardiman, who produced the first album, and so belongs here, but it didn't get released until 1987 when it became the flip of My Bag (although Lloyd Cole prefers it to anything on the second album, Easy Pieces). One live favourite, Beautiful City, was left off the album but the outtake is included here (as well as a live version).<br /><br />The only released track missing is the lovely 12\\" version of Forest Fire (about 45 precious seconds longer than the album version), though a shorter one-take Maida Vale session version from Radio One's Evening Session is included. Two other tracks from the same session add Jocelyn Pook and Audrey Riley on violin and cello, and there is a live-to-air performance of Patience for Saturday Live, from Broadcasting House's sub basement S2 studio (I think Lloyd Cole's comments for Forest Fire in the notes actually refer to this earlier session).<br /><br />Also previously unreleased are the demo for Perfect Skin and five live recordings from 1984 and 1985. These were recorded at Nightmoves, the Marquee and Glasgow's Barrowlands, some for radio broadcast..  <br /> <br />The only released track missing is the lovely 12\\" version of Forest Fire (about 45 precious seconds longer than the album version), though a shorter one-take Maida Vale session version from Radio One's Evening Session is included.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|These two are in the best of the best category of musicians. Always a treat. This is beyond. Take the best of the both of them, and then combine their musical styles and vocal, and wham...just listen, and you'll BE THERE. Seven years is not so long to wish for this amazing collaboration. <br />Wish they would take it on the road.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|After the attrocious \\"By The Way\\", I could've sworn that one of my favorite bands was dead. The unadulterated funk, hard rock, intelligent songwriting, and brilliant vocal deliveries were all gone; replaced by lukewarm ballads and conventional songwriting (a trend that began on the brilliant \\"Californication\\"). \\"By The Way\\" was all but void of good material. That being said, I was sure that \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" wouldn't stand up against \\"Mother's Milk\\", \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\", or \\"One Hot Minute\\", my favorite Chili Peppers releases. Boy was I wrong. This double album, 'Mars' and 'Jupiter', are some of the Peppers' best work and Stadium Arcadium might be 3rd or even second on my list of their favorite albums. Standouts include the Rage Against the Machine-esque \\"Readymade\\", the funky tracks \\"Hump de Bump\\",\\"Warlocks\\",and \\"21st Century\\", psychadelic rock tracks such as \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\", \\"Turn it Again\\", and \\"She's Only 18\\", straight ahead rockers such as lead single \\"Dani California\\" and \\"Torture Me\\", and my personal favorite; \\"Storm in a Teacup\\", which reminds me of the \\"Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\" days. 'Jupiter' is more of a funky disc, with lots of possible singles. 'Mars' has a lot of straight ahead rock tracks, but also a lot of more eclectic experimental tunes. Chad and Flea are tight as always. Especially of note is John Frusciante, who although it pains me to say it (I blame him for the Chili Peppers questionable change in sound post-BSSM and pre-SA), is unquestionably the greatest guitar player in modern rock. He mixes fretboard fireworks and technical wankery with a real understanding of the sonic capabilities of the guitar, and really creates some unbelievable sounds. The only band member not quite up to par is Kiedis; he has eschewed his rapping and wailing for an introspective whispy voice, and simply sounds weak compared to the rest of the band. No matter, RHCP has come back with one of the best albums of their career.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so happy that the RHCP released some new material.  When I first heard Dani California I couldn't and still can't get the song out of my head. Which what I'm listening to rightn now as I write this reveiw. So when they releasd there new cd I rushed in to buy it and I was lucky to get it b/c it was one of the last copies the store had left and that was best buy!! I am in awe of what they've been able to do.  They have a great funky bass line, great guitar solos and pecies, and of course there singer sounds amazing as ever.  Best songs on Jupitar CD 1 besides Dani California are Snow (hey oh), charlie, hump de bump, she's only 18, touture me, c'mon girl, and on Mars cd 2 it has to be tell me baby, hard to concentrate, 21st Century, Readymade, If, Animal Bar, and I liked Storm in a teacup.  This cd is amazing and is ture to what the Red Hot Chili Peppers do best SIMPLY ROCK THE JOINT!!!! Get this cd immediately! It's worth your money all the way.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|As soon as I heard about the new cd by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I was incredibly excited.  I'm one of the reviled people who came to know RHCP through Californication and By the Way.  I'm also one of the people who enjoyed the band enough to get their early pure funk material.  As someone who has seen (and enjoyed) both sides of their style, I can easily say that this cd brings both of those styles together. <br /> <br />Since I've receieved it, the two cds have not left my cd changer.  No matter what kind of fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers you are, you will enjoy this cd.

Love it.
B000002KIE|5.0|You had to be there.  Rock had become so bloated and pompous.  This swept aside all that went before!  So it's great not just for it's minimal, boiled down rock perfection with punk sneering, but it's great for what it achieved - the shockwaves from this record finally put hippy rubbish and its sons to bed!
1593083246|5.0|This is an old time classic for me and one of my favorites.<br /><br />I have went through it about 5 or 6 times already, listened to it on audio cd and watched different versions of the movie countless times.<br /><br />Splendid conclusion!!!
B00003CXB4|3.0|Not nearly as good as \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" or \\"Aladdin\\".  Animation still terrific, but story was just plain hokey.  Same-o, same-o about son being cheated out of inheritance by evil relative, but he triumphs in the end.  Ho hum.  However, the voice of James Earl Jones was, as always , rich and resonant.  There will never be another voice like his.  Jeremy Irons was the evil uncle, but I didn't recognize him, nor Mathew Broderick as the young son.  There were a few good bits, like \\"I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool,\\" and a few laugh-out-loud places, but the story was just too ordinary.  Nothing original here at all.  The music by Elton John was very good though; lots of catchy tunes, no sappy drivel.  The uncle was really the best voice and character in the movie.  No strong female at all.
B0000042MY|5.0|You are missing out is you haven't listened to this one.  <br />Some of the best music so far.  <br />This one was awesome!!1
B0007ZIYM4|3.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I can't say that the chances are good that I would be thrilled by ANY new recording of The Four Seasons.  It would seem that the previous 8 billion recordings of this warhouse would have explored just about anything possible in what Vivaldi wrote.  Nor, I must confess, am I much of a fan of Vivaldi in the first place.<br /><br />Still, I found the stripped down ensemble on this recording to be fairly effective, and Janine Jansen certainly does have a lovely tone.  This recording is a pleasant enough confection.<br /><br />However, any similarities to Baroque music are purely coincidental, because Jansen seems to embrace the 19th-century approach towards playing Baroque music.  From the occasional slurpy shifts and rubato run amok, after a certain point this begins to sound like chamber music from the late Romantic period.  When it does sound Baroque, it reminds me more of the French Baroque of Leclair than it does of Vivaldi.<br /><br />In any case, this clearly is a \\"eye of the beholder\\" situation.  It certainly isn't an ugly recording, by any means.  However, if you are wanting something that actually sounds Baroque, you might want to take a pass on this.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|RHCP seems to get better with age.  Californication, By the Way, and of course Blood Sugar Sex Magic are all classics, but Stadium Arcadium holds up next to any of them.   <br /> <br />The first disc is my favorite and it has my 3 favorite songs on it.  Dani California is amazing.  Snow is a great song with great hooks and unique harmonies that I can't get enough of.  Maybe my new favorite Chili Peppers song ever.  It's amazing.  I also really enjoy Wet Sand, which also has fantastic harmonies.   <br /> <br />The 2nd disc is more up tempo with some great tracks.  Storm in a Teacup sounds like your classic Chili Peppers a la Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  Death of a Martian is fantastic as well.   <br /> <br />If these were one album, I would have no regrets buying either on as stand-alone discs.  It's almost overwhelming hearing so much great Chili Peppers all of a sudden.  The senory overload of great songs almost makes me wish that they had done an album sooner, but the double disc is an instant classic.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I saw the video for \\"Crazy\\" and decided to give this album a listen. <br /> <br />I am in love, and have been boppin' my head ever since. <br /> <br />Lyrically engaging and finger poppin' beats make you want to hit replay. <br /> <br />My songs are \\"Go-Go Gadget Gospel,\\" \\"Crazy,\\" \\"Smiley Faces,\\" and \\"Storm Coming.\\"  My only quibble is that I wish they had gone old school and made the songs LONGER.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I first discovered this band just hopping around amazon, the same way I discover most bands now. The usual rock instruments are everywhere: drums, bass, tough guitar but the cellos that sometimes play mixed in and sometimes double up with the bass, giving it a very unique sound sound. That first track, \\"Neighborhood #1 \\"Tunnels\\", is still my favorite song on the album, with \\"Rebellion \\" coming in a close second. I hear it as being refreshingly original and I agree with another reviewer who describes Funeral as a new direction in music. \\"Funeral\\" is pretty poppy, but poppy in a positive, good sense. I stopped listening to it for a while and recently rediscovered it again. It sounds very fresh and unique in my iPod.  <br /> <br />
B00004LN16|5.0|You guys might laugh at me, but I do believe that this is AC/DC's best album. I love all the other ones as well, but I just think this is perfect. The best song is Stiff Upper Lip by far. But they are all great, so buy it and enjoy!
B00006JDSI|5.0|This version of Bram Stoker's Dracula is impressive, the images remain still mysterious, creating a strange atmosphere. Murnau gives a new touch to the novel, the monster dies for love, he stays all the night with the woman until the morning, when the light kills him.

But his score for \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" is a unique tribute to the men & women who served and died in World War II. The Hymm to the Fallen and Omaha Beach segments are especilly moving and fine emotional tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice and did not come home. Bravo, John Williams!
B00005ATQD|4.0|A couple live a false happiness according to an old man who shows the young man the dark side of the world. Good film by Stanley Kubrick, whose masterpieces 2001 and Barry Lyndon are well known.
0060931736|4.0|Jean Brodie is a teacher at the Marcia Blaine School, an exclusive private girls' school in Edinburgh in the 1930s. The book is about the \\"Brodie Set\\", a group of  six girls taught by Miss Brodie, and charts their changing fortunes, and her continuing influence over their lives, after they leave her class.  <br />  <br /> <br />Miss Brodie is a complex character, embodying attitudes which, to a modern readership at least, seem contradictory. She embraces progressive educational ideas at odds with the conservative ethos of Marcia Blaine, believing that it is her mission in life to interest her girls in art, culture and political and philosophical ideas rather than teach the official syllabus. She makes great play of the fact that the word \\"education\\" is derived from the Latin \\"educere\\", meaning \\"to lead out\\" and sees her role as being to lead out her pupils own ideas by encouraging them to think for themselves. The teaching style of the headmistress and other staff members she characterises as \\"intrusion\\" (from the Latin \\"intrudere\\", to thrust in), the stuffing of the girls' heads with useless information. In the twenty-first century these progressive ideas might have come to seem outdated in their turn, but in the sixties (when the book was written) they were highly influential and in the thirties they were daringly radical.  <br /> <br /> <br />Miss Brodie's politics, however, seem to be incompatible with her preferred teaching methods. She is a quite open and unashamed Fascist in the literal sense of that word. She admires Mussolini and Hitler for bringing, as she sees it, order and discipline to Italy and  Germany and ridding those countries of the scourge of unemployment. She encourages one pupil to volunteer to fight for Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Yet, despite all this, she is not a wholly unsympathetic character.  <br /> <br /> <br />It was clearly a highly controversial move on Muriel Spark's part to give a Fascist sympathiser some positive qualities. It is normally an unwritten convention in literature and the cinema that such characters can only be depicted as outright villains. Communist sympathisers can be portrayed as romantic idealists, even in stories set at the time of the Stalinist purges (think, for example, of the character played by Barbra Streisand in \\"The Way We Were\\"), but Fascists never. It should be remembered, however, that there was a time in the late twenties and early thirties when Fascism seemed to many to be a viable system of government, if only because the alternatives seemed so unappetising. Liberal capitalism in the Depression era seemed to offer only mass poverty and mass unemployment; Communism under Stalin only mass terror and mass starvation. For the likes of Jean Brodie, Fascism was not so much the political expression of irrational hatreds (which is how it seems today) but rather an idealistic belief that the choice between the Hooverville and the Gulag, between the Jarrow march and the Ukrainian famine, was no choice at all and that there must be a third alternative.         <br /> <br />There is an obvious disparity between Miss Brodie's educational philosophy and her political one. She never considers whether teachers who distrust authority and encourage their pupils to think for themselves would be tolerated under a Fascist system of government. In many ways she is a rebel, unable to adapt herself to any form of organisation.  Despite her political views, she never attempts to join Mosley's Blackshirts or any similar movement. Despite her views on education, she refuses to seek a position at a progressive school, or a \\"crank school\\" as she prefers to think of them. She relishes her role as a rebel against the authority of the headmistress, actively preferring to be out of step with her colleagues rather than being one progressive teacher among many.  <br />  <br /> <br />Quite apart from her politics, Miss Brodie has a number of weaknesses. Her educational philosophy is in many ways elitist, concentrating on the \\"Brodie Set\\" at the expense of other pupils and promising to make them the \\"cr?me de la cr?me\\". (She tends to speak in clich?s, often without thinking too much about their meaning- she always insists, for example, that she is \\"in her prime\\"). Her love life is unconventional for a spinster schoolmistress of this era- she is the lover of one of her male colleagues and has possibly been the lover of another, a married man. She is, however, devoted to her girls, who for the most part repay her devotion in full. When one of them betrays her to the school authorities, we can sympathise with her. <br />  <br />This is a very short book, a novella rather than a novel, of just over a hundred pages. (I finished it in the course of a two-hour train journey). Nevertheless, Ms Spark manages to fit a great deal of story into a sort space, a story told with a good deal of wit and style. Not only does Jean Brodie herself emerge as a flawed but fascinating character, but her girls also can be seen as fully-formed individuals, each with her own character and idiosyncrasies. We learn not only about their present lives, but hints are dropped throughout the book of what the future holds for them; we see how Miss Brodie has influenced the course of their lives, for good or ill. This is the first of Ms Spark's novels that I have read, but her surname strikes me as an appropriate one. There is clearly a creative spark at work here.     <br />

B000021XS0|5.0|\\"Where do we go when we die?  What lies beyond and what lay before?  Is anything certain in life?\\"  The race of man has been pondering these questions for thousands of years, at least until recently.  The hectic life of today leaves little or no time for thinking.  This is unfortunate because serious consideration of these questions keeps man above the animals.  They are asked at the beginning of The Spirit Carries On, and I commend Dream Theater for reminding us of their importance.<br /><br />Another question might be does this work need another review in addition to the previous 641?  Probably not, but here goes with number 642 anyway.  After simply listening to the CD a few times, I thought it was pretty good, but not great like Images and Words.  Then after following the lyrics I found that there were four main characters speaking, sometimes in the past and sometimes now.  Since only one person does the singing, it is not always obvious who is speaking when, so knowing those details greatly helps in the appreciation of the story.  Knowing the details of the story itself also helps and reading the info about the CD on Wikipedia provides some good insight along those lines.  Furthermore many of the verses rhyme (something a lot of song writers don't seem to bother with anymore) which adds to the listening enjoyment.  So, we have here a complex work of art, which is based on a previous song (named part I with no intention of there being a part II),  that contains very good music, poetry, a murder mystery, a love triangle (involving two brothers) and Philosophy 101.  How can it be anything but five stars?!!!  (Please see my profile for a brief discussion of my rating philosophy.)
B000EOTAM6|2.0|I was waiting with baited breath for this movie to come out, only to be severly disappointed.I believe one of the main draws of the original series was the over the top sexual inuendos and outfits, which none existed in the movie. I am a big fan of Charlise Theron and consider her a good looking woman, but they could have found someone who exudes sexy-ness alot more than she does. The action was ok but have seen better in B class movies. If you are a big fan of the cartoon series than you will probably be very disappointed in this movie. In short ..they took an MA or strong R rated cartoon and made it into a pg-13 movie...not impressed at all
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Don't judge this album based on your opinion of an album from 1991. yes, the band has changed, the lyrics are not as tongue in cheek, and they write more ballads, and yeah, BSSM is probably their definitive work BUT, guess what. The music is still awesome. Flea and John were absolutely born to play music together. Mars had me from the getgo. Jupiter is taking a little longer to grab me, but it definetly has gems of its own (Snow, Charlie, She's only 18..). If you've loved the band in the past just give this one a fair listen, it's funkier than it seems at first. Oh and by the way, if I'm not mistaken rick rubin has produced everything since BSSM...just saying.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I am not usually one to listen to this genre of music, but one of my friends said that this album was off the hook. I gave it a listen and I must say that this, without a doubt, might be one of the best albums I've heard in some time. Props to Gnarls Barkley. keep doin yo thing.
B000000YBQ|5.0|Bill Evans constituted the great exponent of the lyrical jazz, expressed in the intimacy of small Halls (as the Blue Note). His inspirational mood and captivating expression created an atmosphere of ineludible seduction.<br /><br />He was a true poet and remark this epithet in the sense of creator of new possibilities and lyrical hues. His early loss left many unfinished projects as to record a whole session with Oscar Peterson (imagine that dream come true);but at least he left the best of his craft for the posterity.<br /><br />Waltz for Debby was  arguably, his best referential card, a sublime work loaded of exquisite lyricism and sumptuous refinement.<br /><br />An album to treasure.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I actually enjoyed this movie. It may not have been one of the MEGA SCRIPTS of the year but it's definitely worthy of more than one or two stars.  For me it was the suspense that made the film, and anyone who watched the film without an overcritical eye would definitely agree to the fact that it was full of it. I think the storyline was very intriguing and I am definitely going to purchase the DVD edition. I honestly don't see why the low ratings are so avid.... I mean, did someone get their heart broken by one of the actors and get all their high school friends to come online and say how LAME the movie was? lol... Seriously though. This was a very interesting storyline and the suspense was fascinating to me. I think the writer did a great job of connecting the actors to the audience, meaning... I was cheering for the actor to find out what was going on, to escape, to out-wit, etc... The characters were absolutely layered, meaning the writers/producers did an Excellent job of giving these characters many colors and unveiling them to us in perfect timing. The complexity of the characters to me is near brilliant. Not too many movies can pull off such layered events... I mean, everything turns around so dramatically, yet the audience isn't thrown into the climax with a \\"what the hell just happened?\\" kinda feeling, one that many movies of this genre create.  Maybe there were some scenes that were a little \\"overdramatic\\" (I.E. the girls eyeball hanging out... ew...) but, overall, I was impressed with this film. And I'm not giving 4 stars for moral value! The torturing of people does not \\"excite\\" nor \\"thrill\\" me. I'm giving 4 stars because they did a good job on the film, the suspense of it accounts for most of that. Like I said, maybe it won't offer up an Oscars... but it was definitely entertaining and it was far from a bomb.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|hang on a sec, before i write this review i'm gonna get the thesaurus and look up great. this album certainly deserves the astronomical sales it'll undoubtably have. it starts off with 3 superbly catchy tracks and doesn't let up in quality right through. nearly every song would be a highlight on another album. their is a great range in here, from the soulful strip my mind to the funked-up hump de bump, without the dead-end self-indulgence which is usually the province of the double-album. the second disc, mars, will always be dwarfed by the epic jupiter with the irrepressible energy of torture me and charlie mixing with the cresendo of wet sand and the sad/beautiful hey to produce a hour of sonic bliss. mars for it's part has the great she looks to me and final track death of a martian, though it also contans the only bum note in soporific IF. To call it john frusciante's album would be a great injustice to anthony, whose vocals have improved immensely, but this has the most solos in a non-thrash metal album ever with the previous restraint of frusciante giving way to faster exuberent playing. chad and flea are solid throughout but should have tried to steal the show a bit more while anthony has reached some sort of lyrical nadir. but such flaws are forgiven by the sheer depth in class over these two hours. the greatest double album since melloncollie and the infinite sadness, stadium arcadium is the best the red hot chili peppers have ever done and that's worth a listen.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|For those of you who are reading this album review before going out and getting this album, let me break it down for you:  If your favorite RHCP album is either By The Way, Californication, Blood Sugar Sex Magick, One Hot Minute, or even Mother's Milk, this is a must buy.  There is no question that this is the strongest compilation by the band, as they combine the old school funk-rock bass riffs of Flea and the fast paced turbo rap/melodies from Anthony Kiedis into the more recent relaxing grooves and emotional guitar of John Frusciante.  All in all, it has to be most easily compared to Californication, as it shows a stronger fusion of the new, more mature Chili Peppers without losing the great powerful youth energy and rock-out ability of the younger Chili Peppers.  With this album the Chili Peppers have gone from a band who has changed over the years since their beginning, and transformed into a band who will almost certainly go down in history as the most self-progressive rock bands in the history of music.  This album is more than likely the first double album released by a band since the Beatles White Albums that deserves to have every single track on the albums, as there is not one song on either disc that can be considered 'filler.'  If you are a fan of the Chili Peppers, rock or funk music, or music entertainment in general, you owe it to yourself to pick this album up, as it's a phenomenal ride for anyone who decides to listen to it
0451457994|5.0|\\"2001\\" (the film, that is) came out while I was in grad school, and I still clearly remember how the audience of mostly students came out of the theater flushed and excited and yearning for the wonderful future in space that we all knew was coming. And not long after that came the Moon landing, which we all stayed up late for, watching in amazement (and more than a few joyful tears) as the next step was taken. Now it's almost thirty years later, and we're not even as far along as when Clarke was writing this short novel from the screenplay he co-wrote with Kubrick. What the hell happened? (*sigh*) But I rewatch the film every couple of years, and I reread this book afterward, and I enjoy both, though for somewhat different reasons, because this book is not merely a \\"novelization\\" of the movie. They're two different types of media, and you can accomplish many things in each that you really can't do effectively in the other. The opening section with the man-apes being tweaked is considerably different, being largely intellectual and therefore not very cinematic. The second section, with Dr. Floyd going to the Moon, follows the same action, but this time the film was superior, in showing the commercialization of space transport -- a startling idea in 1968. And the long third section, DISCOVERY's voyage to the outer planets is the most different, with the book depicting much less of the film's horror plotline as HAL becomes twitchy. Dave and Frank never have the opportunity, in the book, to consult about HAL away from his oversight -- Frank is just suddenly gone and Dave is alone. There's also a lot more explanation of *why* all this is happening. And, of course, DISCOVERY is headed not for Jupiter, but only slingshots around it to acquire extra velocity for a rendezvous with one of the moons of Saturn. Finally, the closing \\"Starchild\\" sequence, which was the film's weakest point when we all first saw it, is handled much more expertly in the book. It's interesting to see how Clarke varied the plot details in his two narratives -- as well as his technique, because the book is largely third-person-omniscient, a definite no-no in screenwriting. If you enjoyed the film, you *must* read the book.e how Clarke varied the plot details in his two narratives -- as well as his technique, because the book is largely third-person-omniscient, a definite no-no in screenwriting.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|The memory is selectively greedy. The overall amount of the selected repertoire depends of you and your personal bliss.<br /><br />This powerful and challenging Noir has to do with a simple question: what about you or me if suddenly the lights of the memory simply turn off? What if your capacity to remember is no longer than five minutes?<br /><br />The dramatic and awful premise: a horrid murder and a serious cerebral damage will make your name still persists but your entire life since that moment will be a total mess, a complicated puzzle of photographs, annotations, addresses, footnotes, faces, false names are the lost fragments product of a bloody explosion, that has caused a true virulent disorder of the vital synapses, reduced to occasional flashes.<br /><br />A man without memory will become a desperate man; he needs to belong a country, be part of a community, for love and be loved and so nourish his imagination,  to expand his intelligence and so  to learn and grow up. On the other hand a man with just a memory becomes a modern Faust. Between these two extremes, this anguished man will desperately seek the origin of his emotional wounds to restore a minimum of necessary equilibrium.<br /><br />This striking film - supported by a breathtaking script - integrates an astonishing and fundamental Quartet of golden movies: Twelve monkeys, Dark city and Mulholland drive.
B000001EAQ|4.0|THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE NEXT BIG THING. <br /> <br />Just before this CD came out in 1997, the rock press was debating what was going to be the next big thing in rock music.  It was a few years after Kurt Cobain's suicide and Grunge was starting its decline in popularity.  The mainstream pop was boy bands, Micky Mouse Club graduates and rap.   <br /> <br />At this time, techno or electronica was had a mild following, especially in the club scene, with groups like the Chemical Brothers and Massive Attack.  It was predicted by many that techno/electronica was going to be the next big thing. <br /> <br />U2 had not released a CD in 4 years, and were touted as leading the new wave of techno pop, being the first mainstream band to move over to the style.  (If it took hold, you know that other British bands, especially the Rolling Stones, were soon to follow).   <br /> <br />Well, techno did not take off and \\"Jangle Rock\\" became the next big thing.  Jangle Rock is the sound of groups like Wildflowers or Toad the Wet Sprocket.  It is soft, spineless rock.  It has a fuzzy, jangling sound that is usally excentuated by strumming on 12 string guitars.  It is really just an evolution from the boy bands.  It is the sound of U2's last two CD's. <br /> <br />Pop is U2's foray into techno.  Unfortunately, the band did not go all the way.   They are about 70% there.  I think this would have been a more satisfying CD if they had gone all the way. <br /> <br />This CD sounds much different than anything else U2 has done, although I think you can hear some seeds for it on Zooropa.   <br /> <br />The biggest problem is that U2's vision of techno is a muddled sound.  To get that techno/electronica feel, at times they take the classic U2 sound and simply distort it.  The whole CD has this same sound.  So, the songs are not as distinct, and the CD plays as one long piece (which kind of fits the techno mode). <br /> <br />The good thing about this CD is that there are simply a lot of good songs on it.  And the group does a very good job of performing the songs.  It is just the whole sonic makes everything blend together and nothing seems to stick out.   <br /> <br />I think with some better production values this could have been a five star classic for U2.  They should have followed the lead of the more successful techno bands and should have brightened the sound, instead of muting it.   <br /> <br />I think The Joshua Tree is U2's best album, followed by War.  Although it did not get the airplay of New Year's Day and Sunday, Bloody, Sunday, I also thought that side 2 of War was phenonamal.  It was what really got me interested in U2.  The Unforgettable Fire is viewed as the classic U2 album, but I think that is because it is the one where the world finally discovered the group (with the help of Live Aid).  It is a very good CD, but I think at times it is a little to popish, which is why it was so popular. <br />
B0001Z52RU|5.0|The Butterfly Effect is the best time travel movie to come out in the past twenty years.  With an intricate and fast moving plot that engages the viewer's mind and keeps the adrenaline racing from start-to-finish, Butterfly Effect is entertaining and leaves a lasting impression.  Simply a great movie.
B000059XUP|2.0|I haven't seen this film since it left theatres, so I suppose the visual impact of it must have been somewhat significant; I haven't forgotten one scene and recall most of it in detail.  (Tim Pope is another one of those directors who mistakes music videos for movies.)<br /><br />There's a problem, though: it was really bad.<br /><br />The problem, as I recall, is that we know nothing about Ashe Crowe (wow. what an original last name for this movie.): he's just some unbelievably nice father who (lives?) in a garage shop with his son, Danny.  Till guess what?  A bunch of drug-using, scummy semi-gangsters come and ruin his, uh, idyllic life by murdering his son and then him.  Vincent Perez is nowhere near Brandon Lee's level of talent as an actor, and Lee himself was no Olivier.<br /><br />But Iggy Pop!  He's perfect as the badass scumbag (\\"nothing personal, sport...\\") who puts the final shot in Perez's character on the docks.  He's so good that it's almost like he's not acting.  The best scene in this movie is when Crowe, after blasting Pop's character to nearly nothing, places two coins in his eyes and sends him floating on the scummy city river: heavy handed symbolism, yes, very striking, yes as well.<br /><br />Otherwise, it sucked and strikes no comparison to the Gothic, almost believable majesty of the original.  I remember reading James O'Barr saying that he wanted nothing to do with the film before it came out and did not want his name in the credits.  Good move on his part.<br /><br />Watch the original and read the comic book.
B000063Y8F|5.0|When I ordered this I couldn't believe I was spending so much money on a garlic press. I almost felt silly. The garlic press I already owned though was so horrible that I really wanted something good. I prefer the sharp strong taste of pressed garlic over sliced or minced garlic, and let me tell you this thing delivers. This is by far the best press I've ever used. I've had it for a month now and I LOVE it! I use it constantly. I don't feel in the least bit silly anymore for having spent so much on it.
