0316174483|5.0|Most Ed Emberley books are a treasure.  They're simple enough for children but adaptable enough for adults.  Funprint and Picture Pie are my absolute favorites.  It incorporates all of the Funprint books into one so you can easily find inspiration.  My son LOVES fingerprint art and we have a really good time using the book together- comparing to see who has done what with their respective prints.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great game but there are some lags once in awhile which is not big deal. The force closes always after using 'save me ' option twice is really bad since you lose the points/coins. Other then that this is way better game then the first one!

B009ZZDNT6|1.0|It's ad supported and you have to buy the alarm feature, which makes it useless as a free product. Not worth the 20MB of space it takes up on my kindle fire.
B007QUUIEA|4.0|A really good book with a brilliant and unexpected ending. Loved the character  Patrick. Was also quite funny in parts.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I downloaded this game for my 8 yr old granddaughter and she loves it.  She said its fun, fun, fun...
B001N3OJEG|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is a near flawless crime mystery, with an exceptional cast. The movie is set on the backdrop of 1950's Hollywood, but takes you into the minds of the corrupt and honest, good and bad, LAPD officers as they struggle to solve a major murder mystery.<br /><br />No weakness throughout.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I downloaded this game for my 8 yr old granddaughter and she loves it.  She said its fun, fun, fun...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a little weird, and explicit but overall a really good book<br />Four stars because of the ending .
B000VDUWMC|5.0|I have been meaning to read this book for years. I really enjoy the author's scientific view of history, describing how he arrived at his conclusions. This gave me a good deal of insight on why the world ended up the way it did, answering questions that I had about the New World, Africa, and Southeast Asia. I highly recommend this book for people curious about these questions!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was a great impression on me I want to be able to get the game ,great job on the game.
B003PIS5XI|5.0|If you like sci-fi movies, You'll love this one!<br /><br />The Last Starfighter is a movie that has been one of my favorites since I was a child. Now at 35 years old I still love it!
1609613937|5.0|So many people (my educated wife for example) think that starchy foods are bad for you.( I did not tell her they kept me alive and slender in the days before I met her.)  If they were bad for you I suppose I would be dead now.<br /><br />This book confirmed my closeted opinion to the contrary.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I loved this book..... it shows friendship and perceverance. I think this should win a Nobel prize award. Thumbs up
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I rented this because I heard some great reviews on the radio. I like sci-fi. I like time travel movies. But the trick to a good time travel movie is to not leave any gaps in the sequences...big gaps in this movie that really needed a clever fix.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|This book is repetitive but it is driving home one point and one point only.  I bought this on the reccomendation of a friend,  It is a single issue candidate

0393338398|5.0|Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game is an outstanding book by Michael Lewis that is based on the fascinating and true story of the 2002 Oakland Athletics.  At the end their 2001 season, the Oakland A's had lost three of their best players (Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen) because they could not afford to pay these star players as much as teams with much higher payrolls such as the New York Yankees.  All of the major baseball sportscasters, announcers and writers predicated that the lowly, underpaid A's would be one of the worst teams in Major League Baseball in the 2002 season.  However, Billy Beane, the General Manager of the A's, and Paul DePodesta, a member of the team's staff, had an ingenious plan to field a championship team with a very low payroll.<br /><br /> Beane and DePodesta used objective metrics and statistics to identify under-valued players in the baseball market.  Their approach was very different than traditional baseball managers and scouts who used more of a 'gut feeling' and subjective statistics.  Beane and DePodesta felt these traditional measures such as batting average, runs batted in and stolen bases were outdated and flawed.  Beane and DePodesta used statistical analysis to identify better indicators of success such as on-base percentage and slugging percentage and then went out and signed under-valued players that met their criteria.  While many senior people in the A's organization disagreed with their approach, Beane and DePodesta pursued their plan anyway.  The A's had a rocky start to the 2002 season but they quickly went out to break the winning streak record with 20 straight victories and ended the season with an incredible 103 total wins.  Although their season came to end with a loss to the Minnesota Twins in the first round of the playoffs, Beane and DePodesta went out to make baseball history and change how the game was played.  Furthermore, Beane was offered $2.5 million to become General Manager of the Boston Red Sox, which at the time would have been the highest paid General Manager in sports history (he turned them down).<br /> Moneyball is one of the best sports book I have ever read.  It is a definite 'must read' for any sports fan, and not just an Oakland A's or baseball fan.  Michael Lewis takes a story about dry statistics and turns into a fascinating baseball and sports page-turner that is hard to put down.  In addition, there is a feel-good aspect to the book by showing that an underdog can sometimes triumph against all odds.  Readers that have no interest in sports, or that don't know anything baseball, may not find the book as interesting as sports fans, as there are a great deal of baseball terms such as RBIs (runs batted in) and OBP (on base percentage), among many others, sprinkled throughout the story.  Furthermore, it was disappointing that the 2002 season did not have a different ending for this amazing team.  However, overall, this book takes an interesting twist on the odd but compelling intersection of baseball and statistics.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it is so much more fun than some of the other crap on this site. Love the horses on the game and other fun stuff to do.
B0000AUHQF|1.0|My reason for giving one star is - there is not a zero option!<br />I am a keen fan of Notre Dame football and was eager to see a movie on this, such as &#34;Rudy&#34;.<br />However: as soon as I loaded the DVD it came up as &#34;Region Invalid&#34;.<br />This DVD can only be played in the US.<br />Are you aware of this?<br />If not - why not?<br />If you are then why do you sell it in this market?<br /><br />Thank you for previous good service.<br /><br />Tony O'Reilly
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think that it is very fun and exciting! If you are getting a horse or have a horse you will love it!!
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|This movie was nothing like what I was expecting.  It was SO good and told such a great story about the Hawaiian Islands and the people who have land there that should never be used for commercial use.  The unspoiled beauty of the land was beyond wonderful.  George Clooney was great as a father who didn't know his daughters and became the father he was supposed to be for them.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Friends had been reading this and it is listed as a best seller.  Why, I don't know.  It is a tale of 2 sadistic people and it never gets better and it never ends.
0307887448|5.0|This is not my normal kind of book. It was suggested to me by a friend. I didn't read it rather I listened to the Audio version that is narrated by Will Wheaton. I have to say this was one of the most amazing stories I've ever come across. I am a big nerd and gamer and this book recalled some good memories. While I am a little young to get all of the 80's references the picture it painted didn't require me to know everything. You will totally fall for all the characters and you will be very sad once the book is over. If your looking for a good read this book I recommend highly. And as a side note if you listen to it Will brings life to these characters like you wouldn't imagine.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Remember when Eric Clapton seemed to be trying to become J.J. Cale (starting around \\"There's One in Every Crowd\\" l.p.)?<br />It wasn't terrible but it was nowhere near E.C.'s former glory years.<br /><br />Well, we are still in the midst of the period best referred to as the \\"Springsteen's Morphing into Billy Bragg\\" era.<br /><br />It's not bad but it's not even in Springsteen's own top 7 or 8 albums.  It gets an extra star for the 1st studio appearance of the classic live staple \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\"; nonetheless, people who really really love this album (like Rolling Stone magazine) seem particularly enamored of it's well known political connection to President Obama.<br /><br />It's a good album but you're in for a disappointment if you don't discount some of the rock press hype.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book couldn't put it down since I started and I don't even like reading much! Can't wait for the third
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Really engaging game, very tough to solve, which keeps you coming back. Every bit as good as AB. You wont be disappointed. 5 $tars
B00866H7SS|4.0|I thought this book was better than 50 shades, not so much overload of the sex sex sex, the story altho similar was a bit more interesting.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has a style of writing I love to read.  Characters are deep and intriguing, plot is fantastic with lots of new ideas and possibilities.  There is a good amount of swordplay/war which I enjoy and the magic is very new (at least to me).  I look forward to the next book in this series.  It is interesting to see the political, war, and social sides of this book.  I enjoyed it very much.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed the story line, found the book interesting and would recommed it to others, would also read more by this author
B00865P3AS|4.0|--------------------------------------------------------------<br />2Cellos<br />\\"In2intion\\"<br />(Sony Masterworks, 2013)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />Ambitious pop-classical crossovers from the Croatian duo of Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser, who cover standards by Coldplay, Sting, AC/DC, Fleetwood Mac and Elton John. Sir Elton does double duty, growling out the vocals on their forceful cover of \\"Oh, Well,\\" which opens the album, and 2Cellos covering his \\"Candle In The Wind.\\" Other guests include classical pianist Lang Lang, Italian pop elder Zucchero (on an unexpected Italian-language remake of the Magnetic Fields gem, \\"The Book Of Love\\") and Stevie Vai, who adds electric guitar ooompf to \\"Highway To Hell.\\" Now, part of me thinks, \\"oh, I've already heard this [[ASIN:B000005IXL when Kronos Quartet did Hendrix]]\\" but I was surprised by some of the sonics here, particularly how well Vai's plucked, electrified guitar gels with the bowed cellos, revealing a shared resonance between the two varieties of stringed instruments. This album sits comfortably inside the world of \\"adult-alt\\" rock, sometimes a bit on the soft side, but bound to appeal to rock fans who have gotten a little bit older... Definitely worth a spin! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Reviews)
B008GVD6D8|3.0|this was a good follow up immediatly conpleting this I looked for the next instalment but will have to wait.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never wrote a review before but I had to on this book. I'm really not into ya books but this one was amazing. At first had no idea what people where talking about. It started kind of...... um not slow but not what I was expecting from all the great reviews. But boy did that change quick. Read this book you will not regret it!
B0042XA2U4|5.0|I read this book a long time ago (way before the movie).  The book is amazing such a great story of growth, love and finding your true self.  The movie does not do the book justice.  But you will fall in love with the story and laugh and cry right along with Holly as she learns to grow and love again.  Cecelia Ahern writes amazing books you will want to get her others after reading this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app my two year sister really loves it and I do to really helps me see the beauty of horses
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Fight club has been my number 1 favorite movie since I saw it, so when I learned it was a book first I had to read it. And if you like the movie, you'll defiantly love the book. There's just so much more detail in the book (obviously) that it made me feel like I was experiencing the story for the first time. I will for sure check out Mr. Palahniuk other books as well. Highly recommended!
B003YT5TGE|4.0|Weirdest damn movie I've ever seen.<br />Went into it thinking I'd hate it.<br />I really enjoyed it.<br />I took off one star because I doubt I'll ever watch it again and re-watchablity is a factor for me.<br />I was not very sympathetic to most of the characters, but I enjoyed the plot because it's one that tracks true so far as having a jerk overseeing a bunch of people who are actually smarter than him. I really only liked the guy with the red stapler. But I liked him a LOT!<br /><br />Rent it before buying. If you love it, buy it because I know people that LOVE this film and watch it over and over.<br />And it's a good one. Just not exactly a good match for my tastes.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King is always in depth.  Here he takes a (short) trip into cosmic string theory in the course of a longer examination of human beings and how they think.  I learned a lot about issues surrounding this controversial event in history, quite a bit about the political climate of Dallas, TX at that time, and a few other issues.  A bit more research on my own showed that most of it checks out, only the time travel portion is complete fiction.  FYI, I am an amateur history buff, Physics buff, and practicing Electrical Engineer.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King did it again!!!  I've been a big fan of his novels for years now and this one did not disappoint.  Without spoiling it for others who haven't read this yet, Mr. King's interpretation of what could have happened leaves the reader thinking about all the times they've wondered and played the &#34;what if&#34; game about how they would have done things differently in their past.  Like I say, I don't want to spoil it, so this is all I can say, read this book to find out how things might have been.

B008MF3OEY|5.0|I love this cover.  Previously I had a standard black Belkin cover for my kindle and it was okay...but this?  This is a beautifully created cover, marbled blue with gold, it looks and feels like good leather.  The inside is a soft, almost velvet like material that won't damage your kindle screen.  I love the elastic straps, they firmly and snugly hold my kindle in place.  And I love the fact that it looks like a book and not just another electronic device.  Other's have commented on how the Verso Prologue doesn't shut -- it's not supposed to.  It's a cover not a case.  I have a carry case for my kindle so I have no problem with the fact that there isn't a snap, or band to close it.  I would recommend the Verso to my friends.  I think it's a superior product at a very good price.
034580404X|2.0|Well, if anyone calls this &#34;literature&#34; or even the yuppie &#34;erotica,&#34; they've got to be picking up a paycheck on the side from the author or publisher.  It would do better as a Marvel comic with the &#34;Holy cow&#34; stuff that emanates from the mouth of the heroine.  We all, at times, want a taste of the esoteric, the erotic, the &#34;naughty&#34; stuff, but this ain't it, folks.  You want to read about sex, type &#34;sex&#34; in your google search bar and you'll get sex.  Better, forget sex and buy books by the other James--P.D. James or Henry or William or Alice, uh huh... better a Yellow Brick Road than Shades of Grey!
B009SJ47XA|3.0|Season finale of American Horror Story Season 2...so disappointing. They took a great haunting story (season 1) and abandoned it for nonsense aliens, nazis, zombies, insanity, the devil, sociopaths, etc. the only thing they left out...WAS HAUNTING!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've read all of Gillian Flynn's books and each one is better then the last.  This story was so incredibly entertaining that I really couldn't put it down.  Her characters are so well developed that you actually feel like you know them.  Kind of scary!  I can't wait for her next book.

B00ARAO720|3.0|Decent plot and a good look at the deliver sub-culture.  Worth a couple of bucks to watch. The villain was very well cast and perfect character.
0345803493|5.0|I work with all women at a daycare center and they are constantly talking about these books so I naturally had to see what all the fuss was about and was not disaponted
034580404X|2.0|After all the hype in the media, I though this was going to be a beautiful love story. Turned out to be the closest thing to porn I had ever read. A sex scene on almost every other page and most of the sex was of the semi-perverted variety. I found myself skimming over the sex scenes and trying to follow the plot which was not bad if you could sort it out. Should be sold in a plain brown wrapper. I am not a prude but this was too much!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow, I work at a daycare and all the ladies I work with were talking about these books non stop and I had to see what all the fuss was about. These are not the typical books that I read, but I have to say I had a hard time putting it down.

1451683405|5.0|I read the book cover to cover; it is a pretty short book. I had already arrived at the same conclusion before reading the book. Sam Harris is so right about the illusion of Free Will. Common human instincts will not allow many people to even grasp this simple idea.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice way to pass the time while waiting in the doctor's office, free time while picking up the kids, or just about anytime you need a break from it all. Kindle in hand, tired of reading, then why not play a little cards?  Fun, no software glitches, great!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Didn't realize the Silo world would be so addicting.  This book has many underlying issues that relate to real world problems.  You did such an awesome job.  Divide and conquer.  Isn't that the way of the world.  Great job and Thank You.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|See it period. This is part 2 so see part one first. The Batman like you.ve never seen before. Comic book fans know this to be a shining example of a miraculous brought to animated life, not for the faint at heart. This sorry deals with real issues. Parents want to watch this before you kids see it. There is no nudity the language it's pretty strong, but it needs to be. In dark times the sun doesn't shine, only the determination of one man can save more than a city from falling into total chaos. This stands out from the rest. The extras are full of explanations that fill in and questions you might have.for the last time, if you don't see this, you are missing one of the greatest Batman stories OF ALL TIME!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very good book...not what I expected at all. Turned into a page turner quickly with how unexpected turns kept coming. Recommend this book greatly

B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Constant dc's, unbalanced characters, and only 1 map for 3v3 and 1 for 5v5. Many characters to choose from but only 1 person from the team can choose the specific hero. If 2 people want to pick the same hero, then 1 will be out of luck. Some people even choose to drop game all together so they can pick their hero the next game. If one person drops from hero select screen, you'd return to main screen and have to find players again. If 1 drops during the game and doesn't come back, their hero is dead weight that just stands their afk. Heroes cost a lot to buy with in game tokens. Heroes available to choose from thats free are randomized weekly so u have to buy ur favorite. If u dont get the killing blow, u get NOTHING.
B00AES0AZI|5.0|I really enjoy Dean Koontz' s work. Far-fetched of course, but that is the nature of this type of novel.  There is always a warmth in his writing, and I have to admit that Dean's love of dogs endears him to me especially, and the ending of this book almost moved me to tears. A really great read.

B003G4W49C|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books. I wouldn't have guessed that it would become one of my favorites because of the subject matter (futuristic story of children being trained in space to fight an alien race), but it is a well-written, complex and captivating story.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|Growing up, my sister and I were obsessed with watching this show. It has great values, a great ensemble cast and great storylines the whole family can sit and enjoy. The price I found was an amazing deal as well!!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|The sharpener was a gift to a friend.  I haven't heard from him, so I don't know if he has even used it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this new temple run is basically the same as the first one, except seems to be harder. (harder is good) the only problem is it gllithces a lot. for example once I was jumping over something and got sucked down into it. that is only one of many glitches.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I have a mix of feelings after finishing the book. The story is really moving. The first part is extremely interesting and gives the cosmovision of the main character, the loveable Pi. The second part was a bit slow for me, because I couldn't deal much with the anguish of the loneliness of the castaways. The third part was so revealing that I was in shock at the end of the chapter 100.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game you can do so many things like styling hair doing crazy pica its a lot of fun you should get it
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I would recommend this browser to anyone.  I still personally prefer Google Chrome, but when that isn't available or compatible this is a very good option.  I've used it on my phone and on my tablet, and had no problems with either one.
B004NELBPC|1.0|Yes, you get great articles evry so often. but i am infuriated at constantly seeing the &quot;Please down Adobe Flash to view this content&quot; on every other link. it is as if the people who designed this app don't know or don't care that all new mobile devices do not support Flash! I am sick of this app amd dealling withe its problems.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I would recommend this app to anyone who has a device that supports it.  I haven't had any issues with it.  I was happy to find out that my phone was compatible, and to find a tablet where I could use it because I already had an account with Amazon.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|consistent production quality like  first two movies in the series..and like the other series movies,plenty of humor from the additional characters ( and first-rate actors) thruout the movie
B002N4DYZO|5.0|I bought the vinyls many years ago, in my callow youth, on the strength of my love for Vickers, and fell in love with Ludwig.  Her voice--one critic called it the most perfectly placed of any singer's--is like molten lava flowing out of a volcano.  Its power and beauty in the quartet simply overwhelm the other fine but merely human voices.  Her emotions are clearly expressed throughout the opera--I'm never unaware of her fear, love, and righteous fury.  Oh, yeah, and Vickers is her equal in every sense.  Klemperer stirs up all the power and urgency of Beethoven's magnificent score.  So I had to get the CD's to replace the nearly worn-out records and be carried back to that time of discovering.
B00005T30L|5.0|\\"GhostWorld\\" is about people that are misfits, yes I am one of those people. I watch this movie over and over, yet I never get bored of it.<br /><br />  Enid and Rebecca are done with school, well almost. Enid has go to school to summer school and takes art class. They both make fun of people which is what I do too.<br /><br />They play a prank on the ever so sweet Seymour, People view Seymour as a loser. Any one with a job and not living with mom, is not a loser. When Enid becomes friends with Seymour, Rebecca and Enid dift apart.<br /><br />  I like how the movie focues on the friendship of Enid and Seymour I love it how he shows Enid his collection of music and intresting photos. I also loved it when when they had sex, Seymour kisses Enid. Very sweet.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I would actually give it 4.5 stars if I could, it's pretty awesome but I think I would like it better if it had access to apps on the phone and didn't lose connection to my TV every once in a while. Being able to access Pandora, Spotify, or TinyShark would be neat.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Long game, nice graphics. Nice story line.  Plus, you can try it for free before purchasing.<br /><br />I think it's worth the money.
B000XVSU9O|2.0|I only wish I read some of these reviews before purchasing this book. I have books on eastern religions and many books on NDEs. She made conclusions that are biased with her Mormon beliefs. She mentions that she learned that every religion is neither right or wrong; however, states that one will go to hell if not saved by Jesus Christ. Please, God loves all his children and I dont believe he cares about what religious belief you practiced. Its all about your Karma and your soul. So many books on this subject make this a point. The part where she tells about the council of men and then her farewell and returning to her body was unbelievable to me and just silly. It appears that she is doing sequels to this book and writing other similar topics. It amazes me how some of these authors profit on this stuff. One reviewer was right on point. The title should be Embracing the Cash!
0345803507|4.0|A friend started me on this series as something of a gag, but it actually wasn't too bad. The main female character is rather bland so she can easily be pictured as pretty much anyone you want, but even that is forgivable. The writing style is fairly simple and this is a good series for a frivolous reading session. And in the words of another friend that I thought was particularly insightful: this book is BDSM with training wheels. If you're looking for serious kink, this is not the series you want to be reading.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Love this movie. We watch it every year and I must say that the blu-ray is by far the best way of doing it. There are no extras on the disc, but the title loads quickly because of this. Overall, a great experience and a fun movie. Buy it!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Went into this movie not knowing what to expect, loved it so much, I watched it twice in a 24 hr period.  The hubby enjoyed it as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. Absolutely my new favorite. I couldn't put it down and I will be rereading it. Love it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I kept hearing various songs on the radio and I loved them, so I had to get this.  Is there a more moving song than &#34;Fix You&#34;?
B0094KTBBG|5.0|Most amazing animated movie ever. It is so inspiring and moving. Thank you so much, Pixar, for making such an incredible movie!
B000TERK3C|4.0|If all you know is current Radiohead, this will be a shocker to you.  It's interesting though--can hear the evolution beginning from &#34;Creep&#34; through this album onward.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie is an instant classic! Fat Amy, played by Rebel Wilson, is an incredible character. She makes the movie. The storyline is great! Thanks amazon!
B0000669JL|5.0|I'm not a reggae fan by any means, but I needed relaxing music and this delivers.  Easily singable and shows that reggae is not simply playing guitar on upstroke.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|You really get into these Characters head. I really enjoyed Ana's pull to Christian's fifty shades. I can't find anything to dislike about this book. Can't wait for the next one!
B0000508U6|4.0|Introducing coldplay.  Honestly, haven't listened to this one as much as their others, but still catches you ear.  Like it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I was so heart broken. My boyfriend said he wouldn't break up with me. But I realized... he wanted going to eventually. I started to play quell and then I realized again I was in love. I'm only eleven. But this game helps get your mind off things like broken hearts. Play this game and you'll be addicted out obsessed with it. Enjoy! :)
B00000J7JO|5.0|Great diversity with tempo and feel.  Obviously some classic tunes.  Keep moving and grooving like always.<br />They hit their stride on this one.
B00280LYHS|5.0|AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best book or series ever everyone should read this book of series. There are 5 books have a great time reading
B0050CQY1W|4.0|The first half is slow, heavy, and R&B.  The second is faster, peppy, and more soul to me.  I prefer the second half.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very entertaining and very life like. it has great graphics and gorgeous horses. I would recommend try this game to anyone who loves horses.
B00138KDO6|5.0|I know a lot of their songs, but this is their first album I purchased.  Don't care for '90s music mostly b/c of the grunge style singing (looking at you Pearl Jam) so Rage's style is different, but heavy.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I have read the whole diary of a wimpy kid series and this one has to be the best one yet but they are all very good
B000B0WODA|4.0|FF is known to &#34;make girls dance&#34;.  That's kind of their mission statement.  But I like how it breaks down in the middle to give you chance to catch your breath.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is one of my Favorite games for my kindle fire HD. I hope you get and enjoy it as much as i do!
B0011BGY66|5.0|I love the different elements that VW mix to create their music, especially the rhythms.  Unique.  Contra is just as good.  Excited for newest album.
B0016J81B4|5.0|These crocs are being used in a commercial kitchen and I gotta say they are very grippy!! They will not slip, even in straight oil or soap on a tiled floor.  They're very comfortable and will stay on even if you don't use the strap behind your heel.  The ONLY issue is that it is very easy for garbage and debris to get caught up in the soles.  However, as they are crocs, that's nothing a hose won't take care of.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Music not only is seasonal but should fit the mood.  This is a great band for weight-lifting (I think).  Especially like what they do with the bells.
B003B02O3C|4.0|Easy read . Hard to put down.<br />Very enjoyable.  Well written with suspense and excitement at just the appropriate time to keep you reading.
B000069AUI|5.0|Was &#34;In My Place&#34;, but the album is like a perfectly crafted novel.  Keeps you one your toes from start to finish.  Love &#34;Politik&#34;.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Written well with clear descriptions in the beginning, leading to an unexpected resolution.  Seemed aimless at first.  War-time mystery.  Pleasant.
B000056K04|4.0|To get into it, but I did.  But that just be how DMB is for me.  Peeling off the layers.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a quality production and much anticipated after friends and relatives have raved about it.  I was able to watch Season 1 and 2 on Amazon and now Season 3 is bringing it all together with much more to look forward to.
B00082IJ08|5.0|It's awesome the different &#34;characters&#34; take turns leading songs.  Great from beginning to end.  Kept it going with &#34;Plastic Beach&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played other app like it but none of them are like this I cant wait for the next update
B0011Z933S|5.0|It was &#34;Soul Meets Body&#34; and the accompanying video that exposed me to DCFC.  Thank you.  Full of great tunes and an excellent album as a whole.
B00004RFFL|2.0|Pretty people, decent acting and sexy.  This should have been a reasonably good film but, unfortunately, it wasn't.  The tale is a hackneyed retelling of other 'conquest by space aliens' films and is slow-paced at that.  I found this a film in which I was waiting for a truly original 'gotcha' moment but it never comes.  Instead it plays out like one of those demonic-horror films in which a possessed child--the anti-Christ--is born to an innocent woman.  I'm truly perplexed.  Surely all the truly interesting possibilities of a 'conquest from outer space' haven't been played out.  Why can't the writers figure out some new truly interesting twists?
B000M06K5C|4.0|I especially like the chanting/droning on the album.  This first half of the album is heavier, faster, more intense.  The second half is a little softer and slower.
0385474547|5.0|This book is required reading in some college classes and gives an in depth understanding of the colonization of the African peoples.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Once you get past the transgressions of Hollister and every radio station playing &#34;Dani&#34; too much, this is an excellent (two) album(s).  I really enjoy it.  Variety is a big to me, and RHCP deliver.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|many options and each game can be repeated.  The variety makes it possible to repeat a game without remembering each move.
B0002858YS|5.0|Definitely a dance album.  Shot them to stardom.  So why mess with success?  And what happened?  Do they hate the spotlight?  This is nothing like &#34;Battle Born&#34;.
0802136834|4.0|Weir does a terrific job of storytelling. There are histories that are dry and impersonal, this is not one of them. By focusing on a narrow window, Weir makes it easy to connect to the characters in the book as though it's great fiction rather than history. Never the less, her research is amazing and she has many scholarly points to make.<br /><br />The book begins with a quick run up and review of the reign of Henry VIII in order to set the stage for the assent of his son, Edward VI. It is easy to skip over the reigns of Edward, Lady Jane and Mary on the way from Henry VIII to Elizabeth I. However, much of the molding of the culture, government and religion of England was reaction to and grew out of the context of the radical positions of Edward and Mary. The personal details tell the story of the evolution of ideas, theology and policies. I respect the histories that cover the centuries in broad strokes, but Weir's style of writing is entertaining and informative at a much deeper level.<br /><br />Accounts taken from letters, diaries and testimony give us the expressions on faces, laughter, horror as well as what they wore, ate and really looked like. This level of detail makes it possible to experience history in a full color world experienced by the senses. Mary loved her little sister, Edward idealized and played with his older sisters, Mary fell head over heals for Philip and real people died for what they believed in grotesque ways while wars raged on the continent and an international cast of supporting characters came and went with news, influence and intrigue.<br /><br />I've read more exciting history, but only because the stories were more exciting. Alison Weir is as gifted as any historian I've read. She doesn't document every phrase in the narrative. She tells the story with details and mentions sources in context making her prose flow in a natural and unobtrusive way. It is really easy to forget that this is not fiction. I look forward to reading more of her work including her historical fiction. Michael Schaara's \\"Killer Angels\\" comes to mind. The events can be real and dialogue can even be taken from primary source, but there is a line where an honest historian can decide to write from his or her own point of view and personal understanding without qualification in a literary style rather than as a scholar. The style of Weir's writing here is just to the history side of the line. I understand that other works of hers are fiction, though I imagine them, as with Schaara, fictionalized history rather than fiction in a historical setting.<br /><br />Excellent book, I highly recommend. A must for Tutor enthusiasts. By the way - this covers Henry VIII through Jane Seymour and then the lives of Edward, Mary, Jane Grey (though she is not Henry's child) and Elizabeth until Elizabeth takes the thrown. The coverage of Elizabeth's life is equal in the time frame, but the time frame ends with the death of Mary. Just a brief epilogue foreshadows the actual reign of Elizabeth.of her work including her historical fiction. Michael Schaara's \\"Killer Angels\\" comes to mind.

B000U7VTCG|4.0|I like it, but I need to listen closer to get the proper feel for it. Love their sound though, the baroque, chamber music.
B0087XHODI|2.0|This was a sad book. I had expected a Rock & Roll memoir from the queen of 1970s New York alt rock scene. I had read the book description, but still. This was the story of Patti's life with Robert Mapplethorpe as they grew up together, young Bohemians, in New York. While they cross paths with many of the icons of the day, Patti's music career is a footnote. I have a new appreciation for Mapplethorpe. Art can be disagreeable to me and yet I can understand the artist and appreciate the creativity. Patti's portrait of him is so tender and her love for him so sincere, it's hard not to feel for both of them as they struggled to eat as friends and neighbors in the Hotel Chelsea committed suicide, overdosed and succumbed to disease. It's easy to imagine rock stars and artists crafting personas. Patti and Robert were the real deal and their story very moving. I'd like to mark the topic as music, but this was the memoir of artists one of whose medium happened to be music in popular culture.
0823013626|5.0|I have a lot of clay books and this one doesn't disappoint.  Well, it's Donna Kato so why would it.  Somewhat of a guarantee that the book will be both inspirational and educational given Ms. Kato's talents!
1594484805|3.0|Think of motivation as software and the culture in which it functions as an operating system. Pink explains that while we live in a OS 3.0 world, our motivation techniques are still 2.0 - based on carrot and stick. The industrial world worked well this way, but carrots and sticks discourage creativity.<br /><br />Pink also explains that human endeavor is typically algorithmic or heuristic - step by step or creative problem solving. Since algorithmic endeavors can be standardized, automated or outsourced, heuristic endeavors are the future in our 3.0 world. Motivation for heuristic endeavors are most frequently intrinsic. Thus, employees, students, athletes... should be nurtured, given ownership and encourage to direct themselves. Pink fills the book with evidence from psychology, economics and neuroscience. While the idea is simple, the documentation is interesting. For a relatively short book, there is a big message.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is so addicting. I love it but now I'm sad that I've beaten every level!! Great game tho and worth the money.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I ordered this book because it was a great price and I loved this story. I loved the characters. The ending was surprising and emotional. Colleen Hoover is a great writer. I look forward to reading her other books.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|My daughter and i both love katty so this was a must have. great price as well. daughter was very happy as was I.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am not sure how I tripped over this book for the Kindle. I figured 3,000+ reviewers cannot be wrong - and I was right. It's original, clever, and believable. I had two very late nights because there was no way I could put it down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|everybody should get it its free easy to download an so much better than the first I love to so get it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm totally obsessed with this game. I use to own horses and this is relatively close to what someone would do to take care of a real horse. the graphics are great.
B004UFEJXK|3.0|First, I want to be clear. The movie itself is fantastic. My kids love it. However, the product packaging itself and the way in which Amazon fulfilled this order leaves a lot to be desired. This product was described as being new and sold by Amazon. The product I received, however, was badly beat up and has a Wal-Mart sticker on the front. The movie case itself is in good shape and is shrinkwrapped, but the cardboard sleeve is chipped, bent and looks like it's been in a kid's movie collection for the past several years and not sitting on a shelf, in New-In-Box condition. I don't regret my purchase since the movie itself is fantastic, but for the price, I'd expect the packaging to be better and product description to be reflective of what the customer will actually receive.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so much better than the first. the creators really have came a long way. this game is the best I am already addicted to it and I just got it a few days ago.
B009X01C64|5.0|After I got the corners of the Kindle locked in, I love it.  You REALLY have to push them in, though for them to lock.  I like the swivel of this cover and it stands up well.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|GREAT book! For those in the kitchen, or on the other side of the doors. This book is so real.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is truly a 5 star game! A true point-and-click adventure game,  and,  if you're like me and don't care for the HOG sections,  this one lets you choose a domino game in its place. (I really enjoyed that domino game!) The graphics are great,  and the hint button is helpful,  when needed. Plus,  the dev does not throw insults at the player,  as in a game I had the misfortune to buy recently! I recommend this game to all the true point-and-click mystery lovers.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|First I was shocked by how easily his pen &#34;flows&#34;. I was never the greatest fan of The Who, I mean I always liked the band and listened to all their record including Townsend's solo work, but I must say that this book is a stunning. Sometimes very sad, there  is a loneliness in this man that he himself traces back to a at times rather hostile upbringing. And from a guitarist: it is the best guitarist autobiography I have read so far.
0765325950|4.0|The reasoning behind not releasing the electronic version until three months later is because Jordan's wife wanted to make sure it was on the top of the NY Times bestsellers list. She was afraid that releasing it in electronic form would prevent that from happening. Guess what? They combine the stats with the electronic versions. Welcome to the 21st century!<br /><br />I am not going to shell out my money for the hardcover version just because Jordan's wife is uninformed about modern technology. Why do I want something that will sit on a shelf after I'm done? After I'm done, maybe I'd just give it away. There goes another payment. Maybe I'll enjoy the book, maybe I won't. But, since I can't read it in the format I choose, one star is all this will get.<br /><br />This is some stupid logic on her part.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />UPDATE: I borrowed the book from another reader and I was able to read it without ever paying for it. Anyways, I raised my review to four stars because it really is very well done and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />It's too bad I couldn't get it on my Kindle, though. I certainly won't be buying a book I already read when it gets released in April!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Towards the beginning of Ben Affleck's latest film, Argo, make-up artist John Chambers, played by John Goodman, says to CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck), \\"Even a Rhesus Monkey can direct a movie.\\" This type of tongue-in-cheek word play signifies a new, and deserved, confidence from the actor turned auteur. Argo is formulaic at best in terms of Chris Terrio's screenplay, but its Affleck's direction and the performances from his cast that raise Argo above the bar he set with his previous film, The Town.<br /><br />Argo is set during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, when a group of Iranian militant revolutionaries storm the US embassy in 1979. However, this film actually recounts a previously unknown and confidential story of six Americans who escaped the embassy and were given sanctuary by the Canadian ambassador. These six are in a unique and treacherous situation of being unknown escapees who, if caught, could be made examples of by irate militants without complicating the heavily observed hostage crisis at the US embassy. Their story becomes the focal point of Argo as the White House, State Department, and CIA all spitball ideas on how to rescue these six trapped Americans before they are discovered by the Iranians. Eventually they settle on a long-shot idea from Mendez, which involves posing the escapees as a film crew scouting locations in Iran for a fake movie by the name of Argo. Terrio's screenplay does a great job of building tension in all the right places, but it does so in a sort of Screenwriting-101 kind of way. In other words, it's predictable.<br /><br />Regardless of predictability, Argo is a deeply involving film. Just because we laugh when we're supposed to laugh, and we cry when we're supposed to cry, it doesn't mean it's a bad film. Instead, Argo is a perfect team effort. At its heart, there is a tremendously powerful and amazing story told in an uncomplicated way, which is just what every good movie needs at its core. Additionally, it is expertly cast with terrific performances from John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, and Alan Arkin who steals scenes as the cantankerous Lester Siegel. Arkin and Goodman head up the fake film studio needed to validate Mendez's plan to disguise the escaped hostages as a film crew. Here, the film adds an enjoyable layer of film-geek enthusiasm. Finally, Affleck outdoes himself as director. Argo has a deliberate and even pace, some historically iconic staging, and camera work that enhances the tone of the film. In fact, Affleck even shows some side-by-side comparisons between historical photos and some shots from his film in the closing credits. His attention to detail brings dimension and realism to the film in a time where real decisions had to be made without the luxury of our modern digital age.<br /><br />Argo is the first great movie of the fall season and delivers as both a historical snapshot and an edge-of-your-seat thriller.

B007REV4YI|1.0|come on!!! all this mature they are given the new bond series is enough!!! one thing is give the new films a mature tone, and other is to give this new takes and different twist altogether. i am not criticizing the film itself because its not bad, but it is simply not great!<br /><br />the acting is superb! that is true!<br />but the story is but many mallion miles way too far off the real source it comes from! when in the world did james bond need any help from an old couple, or when did bond needed to booby trap a house to stop the bad guys being helped by two persons?<br />that is absurd!<br /><br />and the lack of gadgets is truly dissapointing! this film has been praised by everyone out there, but have they not seen the classic bond films. one of themany aspects i love from the bond franchise is the absolutely impossible things bond performs with his gadgets. thats part of the bond joy when u go to the cinema and uknow what u will be getting!<br /><br />but skyfall lacks of gadgets and of those remarkable impossible stunts we all miss!<br /><br />it it boring too much talking, way too little action.<br />people who look at this new take on the bond films should stop copying the bourne franchise tone, and attach to the old formula bond that made the bond franchise rose in time. they should even take alook at mission impossible, it hasnot lose its essence. u know what u will get when u go to a mission impossible movie, and they still deliver.<br />but bond anniversary is like a continuation of quamtum of solace dissapointment, only with the exception that the story is in relatively terms good and great on the acting side.<br />but we the viewers and fans, we need to get back the old bond,the old joy, the old gadgets, the old stunts.<br />bond got the actor it needed to fit the role, but not the gadgets.<br />skyfall sees again a bond without the essence (gadgets and stunts) of what made the character.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Steven Spielberg is quite possibly America's most recognizable director. His career spans decades and has produced some of the most memorable films and characters in American cinematic history. Nonetheless, his prominent status has caused skeptics to write him off as superficial, crowd-pleasing, overly melodramatic, and at times corny. These attacks on Spielberg are not always unwarranted, however, his body of work is mostly impeccable and, at times, avant-garde. With Lincoln, Steven Spielberg's 31st film as director, Spielberg focuses on the 16th president's chaotic battle to pass the 13th amendment. While the battle to make the film was also rigorous, it seems that the final product is worthy of both battles.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis once again disappears into his role, playing Abraham Lincoln in such a way that it is hard to imagine anyone else capable of playing this historical figure. Day-Lewis plays the part with a quiet confidence. Lincoln's voice is portrayed with a surprisingly warm, high registered tone. This is apparently, historically accurate and is a nice touch. Spielberg seems to know what he has here and takes a subtler approach from the technical aspect, allowing Day-Lewis and a host of other A-List actors to propel the film. Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader are particularly good as Thaddeus Stevens and W.N. Bilbo, respectively. This subtlety from the director's chair is a good decision, and while Spielberg's approach is subtle, the film is complex. It doesn't hurt that Oscar nominees and winners are in dozens of supporting roles, prompting a superior ensemble experience. Writer Tony Kushner adapts Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography expertly without losing any majesty. Kushner's dialogue is Shakespearean at times and great importance is placed on what is said, not just who is saying it.<br /><br />Lincoln wisely examines the final few months of the president's life as he begins his second term. This is not a traditional bio-pic; it separates itself from the routine of that genre and simply tells a great story about a president who happens to live his life through a series of great stories. Lincoln's political objective is to pass the 13th amendment abolishing slavery through the House of Representatives before the inauguration. This plan hinges on swaying lame-duck Democrats who are about to leave office to support his position. The film is truly an allegory for contemporary politics. It is very hard to watch Lincoln and not draw some pretty steep comparisons with the pageantry and stubbornness of today's political landscape.<br /><br />Most of Lincoln works very well. Lincoln the storyteller, Lincoln the lawyer, Lincoln the husband, and Lincoln the politician are explored evenly and with merit. The only major flaw comes when the film attempts to examine Lincoln the father. It is a well-known fact that Steven Spielberg has had some father issues. He often directs films with protagonists who have a dysfunctional relationship with their fathers. In Lincoln, this element is investigated through Lincoln's relationship with his oldest son, Bob (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Unfortunately, this story is immensely under-developed and symbolically vapid. While Lincoln's home life is deeply important to understanding the man, the misunderstanding between Lincoln and Bob leads to one mildly interesting scene that still would have been mildly interesting even if Bob was not a part of it. Regardless of Bob's significance, the conflict between father and son seems thrown together compared to the more pressing conflicts in the film, resulting in a missed opportunity.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lincoln offers plenty for history buffs to sink their teeth into, and yet the story is accessible to all audiences. Spielberg takes some narrative chances to use unknown history to make well-known history compelling and interesting, especially in the film's final act. This is Spielberg's finest effort in some time. All in all, we are given a portrait of a very great man, and we are reminded of what qualities make a man great.

B005S9ELVC|4.0|(A genre review, to be read `gangster style')<br /><br />This is a picture that says, \\"Listen, you! You'll sit there and watch if you know what's good for ya!\\" Next thing you know, there's a guy getting ripped in half, just so you get the message. Mickey Cohen is the guy who sends that telegram, and he's played by Sean Penn who met `the top' one day and decided to go over it, way over it. Just so we're clear though, that's just what's needed to make Gangster Squad tick.<br /><br />Cohen owns LA, but goody-two-shoes Sgt. O'Mara (Josh Brolin) has other plans for the City of Angels. He's had enough of this sucker's drug running, cop buying, and lady trafficking and looks to put an end to it. Problem is, his bird needs a husband not a hero, and what's more - she's got company on the way (baby O'Mara). Off the books, Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) says O'Mara's got to round up a squad Ocean's Eleven style complete with tough guy Rocky Washington (Anthony Mackie), tech-man Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), sharp shooter Max Kennard (Robert Patrick), and sidekick Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena). Not to mention Wildman Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) who's \\"poaching the king's deer\\" in that he's got an eye on Mickey's girl Grace (Emma Stone).<br /><br />What follows is a ride through the gritty, pulpy landscape of post-war LA, where knuckleheads get what's coming to them if they step out of line. Jerry's moves on Mickey's dame put O'Mara's operation in some hot water, and a cat and mouse chase commences. When it comes to Gangster Squad, you know the drill: operations go south on account that a runt up and turned rat on a guy, tensions swell when a thug drops the dime on his boss, and emotions flare every time a broad bends her arm for another gent. It ain't Chinatown, but it's got a scene that takes place there. Point is, this is entertaining and while critically it may be a bust, here's a fun ride with an expert cast that delivers the goods...with a few bumps and bruises. B+<br />Read more reviews at[...]

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Movies about the movies are generally fascinating, and this genre has really never gone out of style. 2012's best picture Oscar went to The Artist, a film about the emergence of sound in film. Robert Altman's excellent film The Player satirizes the studio system as a backdrop to a murder mystery. The list of films like this dates back to the origin of the motion picture itself. While a common genre to make, these films often find a smaller niche audience and Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock will be no exception.<br /><br />Hitchcock opens with a charming homage to Alfred Hitchcock's television program, Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Anthony Hopkins plays the iconic director, and his bravura for capturing Hitchcock's eccentricities without appearing overly melodramatic keeps the film afloat through its sprawling middle section (which is curiously similar to the sprawling middle section of the man himself). It can be a double-edged sword to be a director who takes on a film project about a brilliant director. Gervasi's film is rather unimpressive in its form. It is constructed rather typically and while telling a story about some brilliant editing, it fails to really practice what it preaches. This film is also not a career spanning project; instead, it commences in medias res as the aging director searches for a project that will validate his position as a master of suspense who is not outgrowing his art form. That aforementioned project is 1960's Psycho.<br /><br />The battle to get Psycho made is an interesting story and one worthy of the legacy of films about films. Hopkins dispels some of the tainted oddity that surrounds the reputation of Hitchcock by revealing the passion that lies underneath. Additionally, the film showcases his symbiotic relationship with his wife, Alma (Helen Mirran), a previously unsung heroine who put up with a lot and always stood by the flawed auteur. However, the film does tend to be a bit too \\"inside\\" for the casual filmgoer. It is almost imperative to have a working knowledge of Psycho to truly enjoy the film. Moreover, there are multiple winks at the audience for those who come in to the theater already knowing some of the behind the scenes stories like Hitchcock's battle with Bernard Herrmann about the score or what images were truly spliced into the famous shower montage.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Hitchcock does sail on in a relatively entertaining way. There is a bit of a lull as the film shifts focuses from Hitchcock to Alma's friendship with Whitfield Cook (Danny Houston). This side-story is pivotal, but it is dwelled on and overly represented. Hitchcock's infamous curiosity with his leading ladies is explored as Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson) and Vera Miles (Jessica Biel) arrive on the set. This story of the director at work is much more compelling and deserves to be showcased a bit more than it is. This obsession that Hitchcock had with his lead actresses on set was also examined in HBO's The Girl, which debuted on the network earlier this year. In that film, Toby Jones plays Hitchcock with a malevolent and sinister air. Hopkins provides a slightly softer, warmer (yet still faintly obtuse) view of his behavior. Hitchcock is far from the comprehensive, authoritative source on the life of its subject. That film is yet to be made and perhaps never will be. However, it is not without its charm and is sure to please fans, although it may fail to create new ones. B<br /><br />Read more reviews at [...]rking knowledge of Psycho to truly enjoy the film.

B007REV4YI|4.0|Skyfall marks the Bond franchise's 50th year and 23rd film in that time. For those familiar with the franchise, it is not rare to see the world of Bond tweaked, updated, modernized, and \\"freshened up.\\" Skyfall is a very different Bond film, in that regard. It seems director, Sam Mendes goes out of his way to saturate his film with thematic trappings that chastise the egoism of youth and praise the wisdom of age. This is an intriguing direction to take, but it does slightly miss the mark.<br /><br />In Skyfall, Daniel Craig reprises the legendary role for his third time. After a tragic mishap in Turkey, Bond finds himself off the grid and at a crossroads. A surprise attack on MI 6 forces his hand to once again enter the fray of espionage where he is met with doubt and reservation both by M (Judi Dench) and newly appointed Chairman of Intelligence, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). It seems the world of espionage has become a digital one and the artistry of the field operative is becoming superfluous. Nonetheless, Bond is reassigned to active duty to track down an ex-operative and cyber-terrorist (Javier Bardem), fueled by revenge against those in the British government whom he believes betrayed him.<br /><br />The Bond films that rest on a revenge storyline are historically some of the weakest entries in the history of Bond, and this one fits nicely in that group as perhaps the best of the weak. The action starts strong in classic Bond style, as 007 chases down a terrorist with a hard drive that contains all of the identities of undercover agents throughout the world. Bond and M's relationship is explored in Skyfall in much more depth than ever before, and this film does advance the mythology of Bond a bit more than some other previous entries. However, the film does hit a snag as Bond goes through the motions of tracking down leads throughout China. It is in China where Bond delivers his line, \\"Bond, James Bond,\\" and it is also where he drinks a Heineken (Heineken reportedly paid $45 million dollars to have Bond sip their brew in Skyfall). Furthermore, the climax, which does reveal the film's namesake, also feels a bit clunky and hokey. While Bardem's villain, Silva does provide some memorable scenes, he is simply a melodramatic excuse to allow Bond to remind us not to underestimate the power of some spit and elbow grease. Silva is, instead, a missed opportunity to chew the scenery along side some of the best Bond villains.<br /><br />Skyfall is not a bad Bond movie, and it is certainly not a bad movie. Sam Mendes accomplishes his goal of creating a heavy-handed thematically driven exploration of Bond's inner workings. This is by no means a bad idea. However, this deviation from expectations is not executed with precision and allows the film to flounder in parts. There are some sequences that are absolutely heart pounding and the film leaves us eager to see what's next; just don't expect to see your Heineken investment pay off just yet.

B00AFEYUVG|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the closest thing we've seen to a John Hughes movie since Cameron Crowe channeled him to make Almost Famous. That film felt more epic than the traditional Hughes film, in part due to Crowe's drawing from his experiences with Rolling Stone. Author/Director Stephen Chobsky also draws from experience to create Perks, however his film has the more intimate feel of a Hughes movie (The Breakfast Club), and that makes it great.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is set in or around Pittsburgh, PA in the early 1990s. Charlie (Logan Lerman) is the aforementioned wallflower; a high school freshman with light heart, but a heavy soul since his best friend recently committed suicide. He finds fitting in and making friends a challenge and instead chooses to lose himself in the novels of equally awkward, soul-searching literary protagonists supplied by his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd). Charlie's awakening comes as a result of being accepted by a group of like-minded upper-classmen. It is here that Charlie's coming of age journey into adolescence finds its stride.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower seems to unfold effortlessly. We learn more about Charlie as he learns more about himself. This surrealist approach to self-discovery allows the viewer to be both surprised by and understanding of Charlie's decisions and actions. His closest friends are Sam (Emma Watson) and Sam's step-brother, Patrick (Ezra Miller), and they shape the heart of this film. Sam's confidence, charm, and beauty complement her romantic and impulsive attitude towards life, which spellbinds and captivates the sullen but passionate Charlie. Ezra Miller as Patrick deserves special notice as he steals every scene he's in. This character is miles from his ultra-disturbing performance as Kevin in We Need to Talk About Kevin, but is even more impressive. Patrick's story reveals him to be somewhat of a foil to Charlie as both have similar struggles of adolescence and deal with them very differently. The supporting characters all have their moments as well, allowing secondary characters to be purposeful and not artificial. The film's best line is given to Charlie's dad, played Dylan McDermott, in an amusing exchange about borrowing money for a date.<br /><br />The success of Perks also lies in Chobsky's handling of his own source material's tone. He never lets us, or Charlie, get too comfortable, hinting that something more sinister is lying beneath the surface, yet he never allows the film's youthful spirit to suffer. This balance illustrates the volatility of teenage years with that same touch John Hughes had. The film also allows music to play a major part in the characters' lives, which was a classic Hughes trademark.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is very successful at what it sets out to be. Many recent films of this genre either feel too self-important and preachy or they go the other way and seem shallow. This film strikes out a balance and while not treading new ground, deservedly treads proudly. B+<br /><br />Read more reviews at [...]l with them very differently.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has said publicly that he wants to retire after his tenth film. He is looking to leave behind a strong filmography that shows no weakness or slump at the end. His eighth entry (counting the Kill Bill volumes separately) into this abstract Decalogue is Django Unchained, and it may be his greatest achievement since Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />Django Unchained is the finest American slavery period bounty hunter Western ever made, but clearly that doesn't mean much. As preposterous as that description is, that's what is so great about a Tarantino film; he digs deep into a traditional genre and develops it into something distinctive. The same can be said about his Holocaust revisionist historical war film, Inglorious Basterds. The title character, Django (Jamie Foxx), is a slave with a horrific past who through a chain of auspicious events becomes partnered with a slavery opposed ex-dentist and current bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). This partnership is sealed with an agreement that Schultz will help Django find and free his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from an infamous Southern plantation.<br /><br />Django Unchained is void of any superfluous substance. From the opening scene of dialogue where Django and Schultz are introduced all the way to the final \\"showdown,\\" Django Unchained has momentum and remains in stride. Tarantino should win his second Original Screenplay Oscar since no other film that can be nominated for this category combines such compelling dialogue with such a spirited and ambitions story. The film unfolds in a series of distinct acts. Furthermore, Tarantino takes his flair for the irregular timeline to a more subtle place by interjecting small contextual flashbacks at key points to reveal critical or entertaining pieces of background that enhance an approaching scene. You may never look at the Ku Klux Klan, or Don Johnson for that matter, the same way again.<br /><br />The cast is impeccable and is sprinkled with familiar faces beyond the leads, but the leads are all excellent. Christoph Waltz gives Tarantino another Oscar worthy performance as the film's moral compass, Dr. Schultz. Schultz's character also works to deepen and broaden Foxx's turn as Django. Django has a goal, but lacks direction and Schultz literally provides that for him, which gives Foxx some real dimension and power. However, the film's crown jewel is found in the film's closing acts when Leonardo DiCaprio appears as Calvin Candie, owner of the massive and legendary plantation known as Candyland. DiCaprio's performance is a sneaky one, and while initially campy, it becomes very real all too quickly. His character shows a severe authenticity as a symbol for the evils of supposed \\"gentlemen\\" during a deeply deranged time in American history. As fun as Django Unchained is to watch, it is still a Quentin Tarantino movie, which implies vulgarity and violence. It delivers on both of those qualities to excess, which is a good thing in this case. As part of the Western genre, a lot of justice is sought out against a lot of bad people, and a six-shooter is basically the only tool. The balance between good acting, strong writing, unpredictable circumstances, and sudden bursts of violence creates a suspenseful tone that could not otherwise be achieved. Django Unchained is a front-runner for one of the year's best films as well as a front-runner for one of Tarantino's best films. If this is any indication of what the nearly 50-year-old director has left in him, it is hard to imagine him walking away after stepping behind a camera only two more times.

B005S9EKCW|3.0|It is a fairly accepted story that when the sculptor, Auguste Rodin wanted to sculpt Victor Hugo, Hugo agreed, but demanded Rodin come to his house, and he refused to pose for him. This prompted Rodin to frantically sketch the poet and attempt to capture his essence. This interpretation of Victor Hugo worked out and resulted in some famous sketches, busts and sculptures. It also worked out in 1985 when Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg interpreted Hugo's masterpiece Les Mis&eacute;rables into a global musical sensation. Now, as 2012 draws to a close, another interpretation of Hugo's Les Mis&eacute;rables has been released. Director Tom Hooper follows his best picture Oscar winning film The Kings Speech with the first ever film adaptation of the 1985 musical Les Mis&eacute;rables. Unfortunately, Tom Hooper is no Rodin.<br /><br />Les Mis&eacute;rables (never to be referred to as \\"Lay Miz\\" in this review) is set during the French Revolution and follows the trials of ex-prisoner Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) over a seventeen year period. During that time, Valjean experiences the endurance and integrity of the human spirit as he relentlessly sacrifices his wellbeing for the good of his adopted daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). Much of Hugo's original Romantic vision is simplified both for stage and for screen. All versions, however, do condemn the corruption of society as its technological advances inspire greed that leads to abuse of the working class, desperation, increases in criminal activity, and a justifiable uprising. Most evocative of this progression of devastation is the story of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), who when fired from her low-paying factory job is forced to sell her teeth, hair, and body to support her daughter. Hathaway has received praise and criticism for her performance as Fantine. However, the fact remains that while not a traditional Broadway-style singer, what Hathaway lacks in technical singing ability, she more than makes up for in emotional presence. Her rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is heartbreaking and touching.<br /><br />While Hathaway performs her role very well, there truly is not enough here to warrant too much attention. Hugh Jackman, on the other hand, turns out a career defining performance that alone makes Les Mis&eacute;rables worth the price of admission. This is Jackman's movie in every single way. Les Mis&eacute;rables is a \\"sung-through\\" musical, which means there is no spoken dialogue; all conversations and speeches are sung. This can prove a challenge for many actors, yet Jackman accomplishes this task expertly with every bit of rawness necessary. Jackman is so good in fact, that he makes it easier to overlook the film's two most glaring faults: its direction and Russell Crowe.<br /><br />Tom Hooper has directed a very standard looking and staged feeling musical here. His actors save the film, which in essence is stylistically a spliced together collection of absurdly close-up one shots that go on for several minutes without cutting. To call this minimalism would be vastly understating it. While it can be argued that more aggressive direction may compete with the actors' performances, it is impossible to look back on the film after viewing it and not feel like an opportunity was missed to make it something more. He does offer a glimpse of creativity with the film's opening scene as well as his staging of the comic relief number, \\"Master of the House,\\" expertly casting Sasha Baron Cohen as Thenardier and Helena Bonhem Carter as his wife.<br /><br />Additionally, Russell Crowe, who plays Inspector Javert, simply can not hold his own as the film's second lead. It is painstakingly obvious how hard he is trying, and this perceptibility is deeply distracting. Crowe does not ruin the film, however since the heart wrenching story and incredible music make up for much of the film's shortcomings. \\"One Day More\\" is arguably the film's most powerful song, and it is sure to stick with audience memberswell after the credits roll. At the end of the day, Les Mis&eacute;rables is mostly effective, especially to original fans of the musical. Nevertheless, it is mostly an underwhelming film, with occasional glimmers of substance, all of which are a consequence of Hugh Jackman's powerhouse performance.

B008220DIC|3.0|Two things can be said with certainty about Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, The Master. First, Anderson definitely knows his way around a camera; second, Joaquin Phoenix emphatically knows his way around appearing `disturbed.' Both of these elements are used to their absolute potential in order to challenge and entice the audience to look a little closer at this film than, perhaps, Anderson has asked in the past.<br /><br />The Master is Anderson's sixth stop on his cinematic journey through American culture and it may be his most polarizing one to date. Director, Anderson has mesmerized audiences with triumphantly engaging dissections of American culture in films like Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and of course 2007′s There Will Be Blood. The Master returns Anderson to his role as writer along with being director after his singular exception, adapting Upton Sinclair's Oil! into There Will Be Blood. This time Anderson takes an isolated and cold look at specific segment of post-World War II 1950s America. Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a Naval veteran who struggles with alcoholism, anger issues, and repressed memories of a troubled upbringing which partially manifest in unhealthy sexual obsessions. After the war, Quell finds himself in a series of odd-jobs that he is in no way suited for, including one that results in his being chased off after one of his \\"home-made\\" alcoholic concoctions seemingly brings about the death, or near death, of one of his co-workers. It is here that Quell finds himself a stow-away on a yacht commanded by a charming, yet nefarious character by the name of Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman (who stars in four of Anderson's six films). Dodd is at sea to officiate and celebrate the wedding of his daughter, but upon the discovery of Quell his interests turn to him and his story. Dodd's compassion for Quell unveils to reveal his role as leader of a cultest group known as The Cause. Dodd uses his wit, intellect, and charm to pray on the affluent, which in turn results in additional wealth, appreciation, and power for him and his group. He is quick to accept compliments, but resorts to shouting down and conceivably condoning violence against his critics. Quell, who has been wrestling with his uncertain future, is easily drawn in by their hypnotizing appeal.<br /><br />What follows is a slow-burn of a drama that gains all of its leisurely paced momentum from the conflicts that arise between Quell and Dodd. It is also a challenging film for the viewer. It is a cinematic puzzle on par with enigmatic films like Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life in 2011. We are forced to pay close attention as we constantly question a look, a question, or an action in an ongoing battle to understand these characters' true motivations. A follow-up to There Will Be Blood, it is hard to ignore the similarities between Blood's Daniel Plainview and Master's Lancaster Dodd; the names are iconically memorable for starters. Furthermore, Dodd's methodical and meticulous effort to distort and corrupt the psyche of Quell in order to vindicate or authenticate himself certainly rings a bell.<br /><br />The Master is not an easy film to understand, nor is it an easy film to watch given its 140 minute running time. What it is, is a beautifully acted and orchestrated character analysis filmed on 65 mm film stock. Anderson takes endless risks here and while the film drags, his criticisms on some of the supposed motivations of those who promise answers, faith, or comfort do stay with you after the credits role.

A follow-up to There Will Be Blood, it is hard to ignore the similarities between Blood's Daniel Plainview and Master's Lancaster Dodd; the names are iconically memorable for starters. Furthermore, Dodd's methodical and meticulous effort to distort and corrupt the psyche of Quell in order to vindicate or authenticate himself certainly rings a bell.    The Master is not an easy film to understand, nor is it an easy film to watch given its 140 minute running time. What it is, is a beautifully acted and orchestrated character analysis filmed on 65 mm film stock. Anderson takes endless risks here and while the film drags, his criticisms on some of the supposed motivations of those who promise answers, faith, or comfort do stay with you after the credits role.

B0059XTU22|4.0|There was once a beloved trilogy. One day, its creator decided a series of prequels were in order, so he directed...Star Wars: Episode 1-The Phantom Menace. Thus was born mankind's apprehension and speculation over prequel trilogies. A case is yet to be made for why Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit requires three parts. Nonetheless, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a very good film...whew, what a relief!<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes place sixty years before Frodo takes his first step towards Mordor. The story is simple this time around, as we return to Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is persuaded, or rather coerced, by Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to assist a party of 13 dwarves in their quest to reclaim their lost kingdom. Freeman is very effective as the neurotic, Woody Allen-esque, Bilbo. His nuanced touch to the role gives the audience a very likable and enjoyable central character arch that is only accentuated by our familiarity with him from Jackson's previous Lord of the Rings films. McKellen slips seamlessly back into his gray robes as Gandalf. While Gandalf is always wise and sensible, McKellen portrays him here as slightly less \\"urgent\\" given the lessened threat to Middle Earth and existence that occurs in The Hobbit. This lack of urgency translates to the entire film, which may disappoint die-hard Rings fans. There are more scenes in the \\"silly\\" category here than in the previous trilogy. Additionally, there is simply a lowered sense of critical doom and immediacy in this storyline. The film's opening scenes go on for quite a while and while enjoyable, the end result is a slightly bloated film.<br /><br />These criticisms are certainly legitimate, but they are truly its only faults. The film looks beautiful and lives up to what one would expect from Jackson's take on the Tolkien mythology; New Zealand should probably be nominated for best supporting actor. The adaptation of Tolkien's book is developed in such a way that it will lead up to the Lord of the Rings trilogy very nicely. Familiar characters appear along the way, and they are not unnecessary or false. All of them further the story and add something to the film, which is a credit to the host of screenwriters including Guillermo del Toro and Jackson himself. Furthermore, the dwarf plotline is elevated from the childish mood reflected in the novel to one that feels a bit more mature. This is a good decision and while younger kids can enjoy this film (if they have a long attention span), it is clear that the Hobbit films look to maintain a similar tone to the previous films in the series. At the end, there is quite a bit to like about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. While it lacks the epic quality and complex narrative of The Lord of the Rings films, the groundwork is set for an excellent companion trilogy that is fun, technically impressive, and brilliantly respectful to fans and film lovers.

B005LAIII0|5.0|First of all, if you like to enjoy a film in its purest and unanticipated sense, just know Ang Lee's Life of Pi is a spectacular cinematic experience. Now stop reading and go see it. For the rest of you, prepare yourself for The People's Critic to convince you that you should find a two-hour break in your day to go see this movie.<br /><br />Ang Lee has been one of those directors who can shatter cultural bias and stereotype and make films that cut to the bone of virtually any genre, culture, or philosophy. A Taiwanese filmmaker, Lee disappears into his material like no other filmmaker. His personal stamp on a film is simply that he gets it right. The Ice Storm revealed his ability to poetically peel the layers off of the American suburban lifestyle and reveal some of the chaos that lies beneath the calm, picturesque surface. His adaptation of Jane Austen's Victorian Romance Sense and Sensibility was pitch perfect. Additionally he has shown a steady hand at vividly visual genre films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. These films bare little resemblance to each other, except that they \\"get it right.\\" Furthermore, no better example for Lee's \\"getting it right\\" can be given than his adaptation of Yann Martel's Life of Pi.<br /><br />Life of Pi is a narrative framed by Pi as an adult(Ifran Kahn) telling his story to a writer. This frame story can be summed up by paraphrasing a quote by the writer who says he's a Canadian who went to French-India looking for a story only to find there's an Indian in French-Canada with a story to tell. The film then transports us back to French-India in the late 1970s where Pi(now played by Suraj Sharma) begins an epic tale of self-discovery.<br /><br />Now, clearly most viewers will be eagerly awaiting the story of the guy on a boat with a tiger, but this film is much more than this. It is a religious film, but it does not preach. Instead, it takes into consideration all of the ideas, beliefs, doubts, and misconceptions that exist and simply tells a story. Do not overlook or underestimate the film's opening act; the setup is as rewarding as the visual magnificence that is to follow. Needless to say, it is the visual effects and cinematic beauty that will doubtless be the conversation surrounding Life of Pi and deservedly so. From the moment the map of the Mariana Trench appears on the screen, hold on to your seats! No film, including Avatar, has achieved this level of visual grandeur with 3D technology. What is more, Life of Pi exists right here on our own planet. Lee's careful precision as a director, takes full advantage of every opportunity to amaze the audience with wonder.<br /><br />Inevitably, Pi does find himself in the unique situation of living on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. However, this is all that is unique about it. Many films have explored the survivor element of what the limits of human endurance are. What allows Pi to rise above those is the spiritual depth that is created from the film's opening act and the awe-inspiring visual effects that are second to none.<br /><br />Life of Pi is a low-key masterpiece. It sneaks up on you and while not complicated, welcomes multiple viewings. The opening credits depicting animals happily living in captivity holds new meaning after experiencing the film for the first time. Lee presents a very enjoyable and thought-provoking version of Martel's widely admired source material. It was said that Life of Pi was one of those unfilmable stories- that it can exist in the mind of the reader and nowhere else. Lee has proven those skeptics incorrect; however, this film is more than a companion or adaptation of the novel. It has surpassed that into something much more special and distinctive.

B00AF6B22E|5.0|Director Robert Zemeckis has given us the latest \\"disaster\\" movie. In the case of Flight however, Zemeckis' first live-action film since 2000′s Cast Away, this is less the Die Hard kind of \\"disaster\\" and more the Leaving Las Vegas type. Zemeckis is a well-known director, whose films have peppered the pop-culture lexicon for the past 35 years. He is a pioneer who took Marty McFly Back to the Future, taught Forrest to run in Forrest Gump, and broke new ground in live-action/animation film making with films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Beowulf, The Polar Express, and A Christmas Carol. This year, Zemeckis showcases his craft with a strong character study of a disturbed pilot in Flight.<br /><br />The intensity and effectiveness of Flight rests on the shoulders of its star, Denzel Washington, and it turns out Denzel Washington has some pretty strong shoulders. Washington dives head first into the character of pilot Whip Whitaker (a classic \\"pilot\\" name). Whitaker is a closeted addict, shrouded in denial. He routinely drinks to excess and uses stimulants to even out before flights. His lifestyle has cost him virtually any relationship or contact with his wife and son and has led him down the path of womanizing and heavy substance abuse as a desperate form of distraction.<br /><br />Flight sets out to tell a story of moral ambiguity. Its protagonist is one who tests the ethical boundaries of the audience where at one moment we are rooting for him and the next, we are disgusted by him. This ambiguity fuels the pace and power of the film, and makes its 138 minute running time literally \\"fly\\" by. Washington is excellent, but Zemeckis is precise in his style, editing, and (yes, Pam and Eric) in his cinematography. Washington makes us see Whitaker's struggle, but Zemeckis makes us feel it with expert use of camera movements, showing us a static sober Whitaker and a flowing, frantic intoxicated Whitaker. The crash sequence is compelling and exceeds expectations, regardless of its assumed predictability. These nuanced touches make Flight deeply engaging and provide for some harrowingly primal audience reaction.<br /><br />Furthermore, Washington's stellar performance is complemented at every turn with a pitch perfect supporting cast including Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, Melissa Leo, and John Goodman (who is 2 for 2 with electric supporting roles this year with Flight and Argo). While the performances and the story are excellent, Flight does not accomplish all it is trying to do. A motif of religious purpose and providence feels crow barred in. Also, while excellent, the soundtrack is a bit heavy-handed in its relevance to what's happening on the screen, which can be distracting. However, these are minor quibbles. Overall, Flight is an excellent narrative that explores the dangers of addiction in an impressively unique way. This is a strong film that expertly demonstrates the talent of its cast and director.

B005LAII8K|5.0|Every fall season a movie comes along that lacks the hype and pandering for an audience. Instead, it is released and looks to succeed by word of mouth. Last year that film was the still under-appreciated Drive; this year my top contender is Looper.<br /><br />Looper begins by introducing us to Joe, a barely recognizable Joseph Gordon-Levitt who performs the title task as a \\"Looper.\\" Looper is a time-travel story, but roots itself firmly in a mostly-recognizable version of the near future. The only major difference is that time travel is invented soon after the present setting of the film, which allows for a somewhat confusing, but well executed, original story. Loopers are hired guns who kill for a futuristic mob that sends their hits 30 years into the past before time travel was invented. This allows for mob enemies to simply disappear in their present time and be disposed of in an earlier time when they wouldn't be investigated. Loopers are paid well to shoot first, ask no questions, and most of all be punctual as hits will suddenly appear in a predetermined location at an exact time. Allowing a \\"loop\\" to \\"run\\" results in some very unsavory consequences. The downside to Looping is that one day, every Looper's loop must close, which means the future version of yourself will be sent back for immediate execution. When this happens, a Looper gets a big final pay day and 30 years to enjoy it before the inevitable.<br /><br />The premise for this film is imaginative and dealt with in a surprisingly cohesive way by director Rian Johnson. As with all great time-travel films, rules must be established so that the viewer may understand exactly what the limits are within these multiple dimensions. I provided a short discussion about some classic time travel theories in a previous blog post that you can read here. In short, this particular film's view is similar to the Back to the Future variety where you can co-exist with multiple versions of yourself and events that affect the younger version will also impact the later version. Thus, when Joe finds himself face to face with his older self, played by Bruce Willis, he inadvertently allows him to run. However, Willis' character can not simply run since he knows the consequences against Gordon-Levitt will affect him too.<br /><br />The story's arc is much more far-reaching and complex than a cat-mouse chase between alternate versions of Joe. As we learn more about Joe's future from Bruce Willis, our sympathies are toyed with and our moral centers are jarred endlessly. Johnson's screenplay and direction provide powerful and conflicting motivations for both characters, making the movie deeply engaging and surprisingly fresh. Additional story lines regarding a futuristic crime boss (Jeff Daniels), a fellow Looper (Paul Dano), and farmhouse mother and her son (Emily Blunt and an Oman-esque Pierce Gagnon, respectively) all flesh out this film and give it real dimension and pragmatism, regardless of its sci-fi, time travel plot.<br /><br />Looper is a tightly wound, entertaining film that has something for everyone to enjoy. There is a slight dragging feeling at the close of its second act, but this perceived lull is making way for a strong and dominant conclusion. In summary, this review only touches on the surface of what Looper accomplishes; there are multiple surprises in store for all audiences who see it, so let the word of mouth begin!

B008220D5K|2.0|Judd Apatow has found his cinematic niche in watching outsiders become insiders.  The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Funny People all examine likable, but slightly introverted, man-children.  Each of these films attempts to show that the geeky child in all of us doesn't have to go away, but it has to grow up a little bit.  Apatow's latest film, This is 40 is a departure from this philosophy and unfortunately, it suffers for it.  This is 40 feels like an anti-Apatow film in that now we are watching dull, angry insiders desperately pining away for the days when they were outsiders.<br /><br />This is 40 is marketed as the \\"sort of\\" sequel to Knocked Up.  This is because it focuses on married couple Debbie and Pete, peripheral characters from that film.  It is fair to call this a personal film for Apatow since Debbie is once again played by Apatow's real wife Leslie Mann, and her two kids, Charlotte and Sadie, are played by his actual daughters.  Pete is reprised by Paul Rudd, which has to create some excellent awkward moments on the set as Rudd is directed by Apatow to essentially `be' Apatow alongside his entire family.  Other than these characters, and a couple other very minor ones, this film certainly deserves the \\"sort of\\" moniker that it gets since it takes a completely different tone than Knocked Up and leaves behind virtually everything that made that movie work.<br /><br />We drop in on Debbie and Pete five years after Knocked Up, and things are not good.  The characters are facing their 40th birthdays and you'd think it's the end of the world.  Apatow has stripped his characters of their geek-child, and what is left is sad adults, angry kids, and a lot of yelling.  It does not matter what your experience is with 40 or teenagers, this film uncomfortable viewing to say the least.<br /><br />There is not much fun to be found in This is 40.  Judd Apatow has always found some stronghold of critical praise in that he is given credit for being `honest.'  Basically, many critics say his comedies get away with being raunchy and crass because they are `honest.'  Actually, his comedies get away with being raunchy and crass because they are funny and filled with fun, and yes honestly realistic, characters, but that is not the case in This is 40.  Whether or not one can relate to the problems of the characters, this is not an enjoyable movie.  Problems are unrealistically piled on, Debbie's father (John Lithgow) is nothing more than a caricature whose lines are unintentionally laughable, and the movie is plotless but not in an artistic way.  Outside of a joke or two that work, especially the ones coming from Pete's dad (played by Albert Brooks), This is 40 is packed with uninteresting side-line characters who come and go like Saturday Night Live characters, and it is entirely too long.  Even the great Melissa McCarthy's scene is a dud, except for showing the audience that the main characters can bond over attacking a nine-year-old boy and then making his mother look stupid for being outraged.<br /><br />This is 40 is certainly a disappointing direction to see Apatow heading in.  Hopefully, he'll reexamine the lives of his characters and find better forms of `honesty' than misery.

B00637D114|3.0|I admit I don't remember the Smurfs that much these days.  I haven't watched the cartoon in a good 25 years.  The only episode I can remember is the one where the sun would rapidly rise and set rather quickly.  What I *do* remember however, is the cartoon being much funnier than this failed attempt at a movie.<br /><br />This is one of the rare times when implementing animated characters in a realistic setting doesn't work for me.  In this case, the Smurfs enter a portal as a way to escape an angry wizard and find themselves in Manhattan.  While there, they stumble upon an apartment where the character of Neil Patrick Harris and his pregnant wife are staying.  The Smurfs then go on an adventure around the city (while dragging Neil Patrick and his wife along) awaiting the next blue moon so they can all return home.<br /><br />These Smurfs are really boring and unfunny.  Yes, I realize that being a 31-year old man, this movie isn't exactly intended for me.  However I really enjoy the Alvin & the Chipmunks movies.  These are really hilarious.  Not a single Smurf stands out to me other than the female one, and this is *only* because she's the only female of the bunch (and admittedly, kind of cute!)<br /><br />I don't even remember an evil wizard guy named Gargamel with an orange cat from the cartoons.  This guy and his crossed-eyed cat chases the Smurfs around the city streets.  The problem is that this little adventure isn't a particularly interesting one.  The Smurfs mess up the home of Neil Patrick Harris, create chaos at the downtown mall and get all the children excited when the kids spot the Smurfs running around (and assume they're some kind of high tech toy upon seeing their realistic movements) and near the end all the other Smurfs get together as a way to take down the bad guy but... I never laughed once.  I never felt entertained once.<br /><br />The segment with the Smurfs playing Guitar Hero with Neil Patrick Harris isn't the least bit funny to me and was seriously overdone and unnecessary.  In fact I consider Neil Patrick Harris completely unsuitable for this role.  He's much nastier and raw in his comedy performance usually (well I mean, in other films- obviously How I Met Your Mother is rather tame).  The only thing I really liked is the family's basset hound and this is only because I'm a fan of dogs (hounds and retrievers in particular).<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't entertained.  Bland Smurf characters, average storyline, and bad movie overall.  Skip it.

0679759328|5.0|Anita Brookner is the master of the quiet moment, of the invisible psychological turning-points upon which the course of entire lives depend and change forever. Outwardly, nothing, or, at most, very little, ever happens in her novels. This is the key to her realism. In real life, the revolutions are interior; often what changes us most radically happens in the private moments that no one ever witnesses, a result of the thoughts, reflections, and dreams that occur by necessity when we are most alone, closest to our true selves.<br /><br />It is in describing the life of the solitary that Brookner most excels. In \\"Hotel Du Lac\\" she does this through the character of Edith Hope. Edith is an English writer of old-fashioned romance novels who, having committed an all-too-non-fictional romantic gaffe, has agreed to a period of semi-voluntary exile at a fashionably unfashionable lakeside hotel in Switzerland. Here she hopes to recover her equilibrium  and her dignity after an unsettling love affair with a married man and a broken wedding date with another that she accepted as consolation.<br /><br />Ironically, Edith is not ironic about the romance in the novels that she pens. As a woman, she is something of an anachronism in a modern world turned cynical in its attitudes towards romantic love. At the hotel, among its largely female guests, she meets a man who singles her out as a prime candidate for what he considers an ultra-modern, ultra-liberated, ultra-practical \\"arrangement\\" of mutual benefit. It is, Edith realizes, a tempting offer; perhaps the best and last that will come her way. Whether she accepts or not will determine not only the course of her future but define her character. Does she amend the errors of her romantic illusions and take the offer, which would appeal to any truly modern woman? Or does Edith reaffirm her romantic convictions, even if a happy ending isn't in the plot for her?<br /><br />It is the coming of Edith's personal, private apocalypse that gives \\"Hotel Du Lac\\" its tension and its drama and that makes it a riveting read. Its climax isn't so much explosive, as it is detonative. It shakes one at the deepest, albeit quietest levels. One reads Brookner and realizes only belatedly how much one has been shaken up and rearranged. She affects one without showy spectacle, but at one's very foundations.<br /><br />Memorable Lines:<br /><br />\\"It is my contention that Aesop was writing for the tortoise market. Hares have no time to read. They are too busy winning the game. The propaganda goes all the other way, but only because it is the tortoise who is in need of consolation. Like the meek who are going to inherit the earth.\\"<br /><br />\\"If one is prepared to do the one thing one is drilled out of doing from earliest childhood--simply please oneself--there is no reason why one should ever be unhappy again.\\"<br /><br />\\"With some people, the shadow of their death precedes them; they lose hope, appetite, viability. They feel the meaning of their lives draining away, and they recognize that they have lost, or never attained, their heart's desire, and they give up. In the eyes of such people one reads dreadful recognition, the ultimate self-knowledge: I have not lived enough and it is too late to redeem myself. \\"<br /><br />\\"It occurs to me that some women close ranks because they hate men and fear them. I'm not talking about the feminists. I can understand their position, although I'm not all that sympathetic to it. I'm talking about the ultra-feminine. I'm talking about the complacent consumers of men with their complicated but unwritten rules of what is due to them. Treats. Indulgences. Privileges. The right to make illogical fusses. The cult of themselves. Such women strike me as dishonorable. And terrifying. I think perhaps that men are an easier target. I think perhaps the feminists should take a fresh look at the situation.\\"gives \\"Hotel Du Lac\\" its tension and its drama and that makes it a riveting read.

0425098478|5.0|This book is an incredibly quick and easy read and teachings principles that can be used in every aspect of your life.  I read it in one sitting and tried taking notes but there is too much good information in such a small book.  Will definitely reread and try to incorporate what i learned into everything that I do.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not put this book down. The story is told with such emotion that it captures your very heart...you become genuinely connected to the characters throughout the book and feel as though you are one of the family by the end. If you liked \\"The Help\\", then this is a must read!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Think it's a four cos it's fun, but crashes a lot. :p What can I say, though? All it needs is One Direction.. Am I right?
B00B2V66VS|3.0|IN MY OPINION!! I don't think I can get used to this new version, as well as I picked up on the 1st one. But it is OK if you need another one of those apps that you can play occasionally.<br /><br />Thanks for reading! ;-D
B007EECSFA|4.0|I liked the way it ended.  It seemed to take a long time to get to the end. Bouncing from past to present made me a little crazy but the way the author wrapped it up for the ending was really surprising.  Nicely done.  I will recommend this book to some of my friends.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I haven't read the other reviews on here, but I'm sure they cover the actual headset well.  It's a great headset - comfortable unless you are going to wear it more than 2 or 3 hours, and all headsets tend to be uncomfortable after that length of time.<br />  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars, is the Logitech G930 software.  When you plug the receiver in, it tries and tries to pair with the headset, which is fine.  But it does this by apparently doing a hardware scan, so you get (over your speakers) the little Windows \\"found new hardware\\" sound over and over again insanely fast.  If you don't turn the headset on right then, or ideally before you plug in the receiver, it will not work until you take the receiver out and put it back in.<br />  The biggest annoyance with this set is that if you turn the headset off, your computer will still try to send sound to the headset instead of your speakers.  You have to unplug the receiver completely when you want to use your speakers.<br />  Also, in the \\"G-Key\\" setup section of the software, there is apparently no way to have the G-Keys set to a custom command.  There are a few (not many) pre-defined options for the G-Keys.  But I would like to be able to program the keys to equal a key combination (I want to program a G key to do ALT-TAB), or even just run a program or script that I create - and I can't do any of those things.<br />  That's a lot of negative about the software, but I still give this headset 4 out of 5 stars, because the headset itself is so good.  This headset would be my favorite headset ever if they would only fix a few annoyances in the software.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Great special effects; good to see different roles for the actors staring in this movie. Will recommend to friends who like movies dealing with childhood favorites.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|Really? Even the task killer won't kill it.  There is no way to stop this thing from running? Uninstalling after the first try.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Well first of all I LOVE Phillipa Gregory and the way she writes historical fiction. Once you get into her books at least for<br />me I cannot put them down.  I have read every book she has written and an always checking to see if another one<br />has become available.  Usually the wait is awful for me as I love her writing and nobody compares with her.  I have tried<br />other authors but none can hold a candle to her. My mother has read all her books as well and waits patiently for me<br />to finish so she can read them.  Unfortunately I have a kindle now, so I have to actually GO to the book store and buy<br />the books for my mom because she just wouldn't understand how the kindle works, so I am actually buying her books<br />twice.  But that's okay we ADORE her!!!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm going to love watching for more from Anthony Ryan!  I loved his characters and found the book almost impossible to set down. Sadly, it ended and now I am eagerly awaiting the next of this series, Tower Lord, when it comes available.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It fun and good for car trips and at home free time. I love it because it involves horse games
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got hooked on this one pretty quickly.  It's a good read with very well developed characters.  Though parts of the story are predictable, the backstory to these parts isn't.  Makes a fun read!  Also, it's easy enough to put down and pick back up again without too much trouble if you get interrupted a lot.<br /><br />I was so sad when the 5 stories came to an end that I really wanted more.  Then I found that six and seven were already out.  Quick work!  I haven't had a lot of reading time since I finished this but I am halfway through six and it's at least as good as the first set!
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Thank you to WB animation for doing justice to one of the best comic story lines of all time. Michael Emerson and Peter Weller do a fantastic job capturing the essence of Frank Millers trademark take on the characters.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I have only played first two areas and like the grapics and play style. I do not like having to buy ingame credits to get the best items and upgrades in the game. I prefer to pay for a good game one time and get full access to game and grind for the Good Stuff. 4 Stars because game makes you write review if you want to continue game updtes.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|A neat little game to burn some time with.  Too bad it's so difficult to get gems.  To really progress takes gems and you can't get gems without progressing.
0385341008|5.0|This book was truly a great read.  Not only was it well written, in an interesting style, I learned a lot about Guernsey Island. I enjoy all types of novels and regardless of the genre I want a book which is hard to put down.  This was one of those books.  It was recommended to me and I have given it as a gift to others.  Everyone loves it.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|One of his best books, cannot get enough of John Rebus, keep them coming. No retirement as of yet for Rebus.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Perfect size for a key chain. Works great. Only took me a couple swipes and then my knives were better then new.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|great action, with humor and very enjoyable, highly recommend this to all action pack lovers.  can't wait until next movie
0061733199|5.0|Great read. Does a great job of walking you through steps and uses simple language to do so. Good for everyday outdoors men knowledge.
B002MFX260|5.0|Atmospheric.  Ahead of its time.  Great horror and drama.  A landmark film in the horror genre.  I highly reccommend it to everyone who loves horror films.  A must see!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Sound of Music is a classic. It is based on a true story of a family - Von-Trapps - who left Austria at the beginning of WWII. The story, music, and dancing will lift your spirits. The locations in are beautiful.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game plenty of varity in the game and I like it. Would recommend it for everyone.  Have fun playing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like this game  I heard so much about so I wanted to try it and am glad I did thanks.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly cranks out Harry Bosch stories, and, of course, as in mass production process for the masses, old ground is re-plowed.<br />But, in this novel, Connelly weds us to Harry in his obsession to render justice and cut through the bureaucracy baloney.  Harry is a believable character who we never want to abandon.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I love tis album and listen to it at work and going to work every day thanks. Keep comming up with this kind of music.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Today, horror movies and shows seem to rely on nothing but formulaic scenes of graphic sex, incessant graphic language, and hardcore violence or spirits tormenting people.<br />Though this show has some of that, it doesn't feel formulaic. Instead, it definitely goes to the prime roots of our fears, not the cheesy one-dimensional villains of any given B horror flick, but the things that get us to cringe, things that tv audiences cried out against the show for being tasteless. Personally, I felt it showed the true causes of our fears. Things we don't want to think about, the show's creator wanted to get out of his head (and society as well as church-he's a devout Catholic, think about that for a moment) and had to have a good opportunity to do so.<br />What you have is a man that was caught cheating on his wife with a teenage patient. To (reluctantly) start over, they move to Los Angeles and find a beautiful Victorian-era home and, even after finding out its grisly history, move in. Right after they do, bizarre thigns happen. Nothing expectant like blood creeping out the wall or messages appearing on steam-fogged mirrors. Much more disturbing and subtle. Not to mention an exceptionally twisted, psychotic neighbor with multiple layers of her character that reveals more than what's obviously wrong with her in the first place. With all but the last episode, there's a prologue that takes place at random times through the history of the house and shows how the ghosts came to be trapped in the house, some far more disturbing than others (including a nice twist of speculation on the Black Dahlia Murder).<br />Exceptional storytelling with both obvious and subtle twists in the story as well the horror elements and the characters having a lot of depth to them (and not only Jessica Lange's character, either, she just ends up being a scene stealer). Not to mention the house itself gives plenty of creative freedom to do as the producers and showmakers wish to and they give theirselves no limit as to what they do- constantly pushing the limit, so some fo the stuff may very well be like a trigger for some (especially if a viewer or two are suicide survivors), but it all comes down to show what we Americans fear about ourselves.<br />Honestly, as a horror fan that got tired of today's status quo on how horror films have become in the last decade and a half, I'm glad that this show came as a breath of fresh (maybe a little tainted) air. Now to wait for AHS:Asylum.elves no limit as to what they do- constantly pushing the limit, so some fo the stuff may very well be like a trigger for some (especially if a viewer or two are suicide survivors), but it all comes down to show what we Americans fear about ourselves.<br />Honestly, as a horror fan that got tired of today's status quo on how horror films have become in the last decade and a half, I'm glad that this show came as a breath of fresh (maybe a little tainted) air.

B004EBT5CU|3.0|I like some songs on this CD just not to hot on the slow music right now I keep on looking thou.
0696204800|5.0|I found this book very helpful when I was working on a guild project that required a finished 5&#34; square.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|The product came today and was in perfect shape! I am extremely happy with my purchase and recommend this to everyne!
B009E3EY38|5.0|What is not to like. The sound is great, good song selection Jason does a very nice job filling in for his father. Best of all its something new from Zepplin
B009H442DG|5.0|This was a gift I purchased for someone. I am extremely perplexed at how hard this was to find. The person I gave this to says all these songs are amazing and was very happy to receive this because they had tried so hard and looked everywhere to purchase it.
B009K916ZK|5.0|It does the work for what it was intended. Apple always offers good products so I always recommend them to anyone
B009NPA3MS|5.0|American Idol winner from 2012 Phillip Phillips cd is awesome! I listen to this cd every day on the way to work. His music has grown on me too.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This season is where a lot of the stories left open-ended finally came together and it's clear the writers are starting to tie up some loose ends with regards to the storylines.<br /><br />First, the Slutty Pumpkin storyline is finally reconciled when Ted meets her, albeit nearly a decade later (played by Katie Holmes).  The last five minutes of the episode are awesome, and almost made me a Katie Holmes fan (when she explains their short relationship from her point of view).<br /><br />Also, Marshall and Lily finally have their baby, a long-awaited moment--and Lily's father finally comes back into the picture.  This is further expanded on in season 8, where he finally redeems himself (as much as possible) after not being there during her childhood.<br /><br />There are a lot of moments in this season that made me cry! The episode \\"Tailgate\\" and towards the end of the season, the awkward exchange between Ted and Robin as he finally lets her go (\\"No Pressure\\").  Overall, this was an excellent season and viewers see the show start to mature.
8862937148|5.0|I love cute little planners. This has small lines and better for people that write with tiny letters. Thank you
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Like all the other reviews here for this mouse, it really is great.<br /><br />Since a lot of the other reviews here already cover what I had in mind to say, I'll just write some additional information I think the other reviewers may have left out (so you don't re-read all the same info over and over ;)<br /><br />I find myself palming mice often, and it fits well. It's about 5 inches in length and maybe 2.5 or 3 across. I put my hand into a claw position and all the buttons near the thumb are in perfect position. The hardest to reach buttons (for both positions) are the two ones below the scroll wheel). There was one reviewer who said they hit the DPI button a lot... I don't see how it can happen unless you are really mashing your mouse, at least for my hand-size (I'm 5'9\\"). Anyhow, you can re-map the DPI button if that happens a lot for you.<br />It has a rubberized grip on the left, the palm area has a rubber finish, the mouse buttons are plastic, and the right side is plastic. The wheel is rubberized. I'll add some pictures later on to the product page...<br />You can customize all the buttons. The things you can change them to are: thee standard click/right click, etc stuff, DPI, media functions, single and combo keys, and macros, also it has stuff like new window, show desktop and other windows functions... like print haha. Also unlike some of the other mice on Amazon like the Perixx or the M90 by Cosair, you CAN do mouse clicks in the macros.<br />All the buttons have the nice clicking sound, doesn't feel like you're having to push a lot in terms of depth. All qualities of a great mouse.<br />There are 8 weights, and the weights have their own container.<br />You can get the software from ianker [dot] com (I hope Amazon doesn't censor the site link this way), and I found it intuitive to use and no setup problems, etc (using Windows 8 x64). Also, Anker recently updated the software, so maybe a few of the reviews here are outdated on the software?<br />The braided cable is very nice. Not rubber thankfully! Bends/flexes well and isn't stiff.<br />Mmm... the pads are good on the bottom. Two pinkie sized ones near the top, one large sweeping one near the bottom. (the ianker site has good images of this stuff btw if you look up this mouse there).<br />Also, this thing comes with an 18 month warranty. It doesn't say the details about the warranty, but I suppose they're online or something.<br /><br />[edit]: I had the mouse for about 10 days then the cursor started acting sluggish (as if all actions were delayed by about half a second) and couldn't fix it myself, having the same problem on several computers. I contacted customer support and they offered me a refund (they couldn't do a replacement since they were out of stock at the time). They were quick and prompt in handling my case (less than 6 hours response time). It was a good mouse and I'm a bit sad to see it go.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really liked this book! Different, exciting, interesting, and makes you want to keep reading more. Can't wait to see the movie!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Excellent reference to read quickly and also to go back to.<br />Very informative and recommend this if you are considering taking away the wheat products or needing something to try for you health.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Was wonderful having the option to rent ELF from my amazon.com account and run on my TV while my 27 year old daughter and her friend were here visiting from out of state, for the holidays.  They were wrapping presents and enjoying the spirit of Christmas, talking about their favorite Christmas movies & ELF came to mind. So we looked it up on Amazon, we didn't have to hassle with going to the video store to find it - it  was right at our fingertips.  As they watched it, they seemed to be transported back to when they where children and spending Christmas together - it was wonderful seeing them laugh and act like kids again.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was a very well written book. I've read thousands of fantasy novels and this ranks up in the top
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is amazing very good graphics but every time I'm done with a match, the credits I earned go down about a half of the total amount I earned. I have the game on my iPod and logged in on the same account I'm using for my kindle before I got the game on my kindle.  Dose that effect the account on my kindle if I had it on my iPod with the same account ??please respond or send in an update.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|One of the best so far. Each chapter keeps you turning the page long after good sense tells you to stop
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Being in my early teens, I find it quite hard to find a book which I enjoy and a book I cannot put down. This novel was the book I was looking for. I feel empathy towards the  protagonist an her parents. If there were a movie made I would not go see it as I feel it could ruin the whole story.<br /><br />Very like Wings over Delft by Aubrey Flegg
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a fantastic book read it u will love it but read the first book first the first book is called the hunger games then read this book then read the last book in the series called Mockingjay!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!x!!!!!!!!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I thought that it was a great book. I thought it was a quite good book. It was also a slightly strange book.<br />Anonymous<br /><br />P.S. it was also very much like the rest of the rest.<br />It was slight gross because of all of the kissing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much I love how virtual it is,  its that game you hide under the covers when your parents tell you to go to bed. I love this game you have to get it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very gripping and heartfelt story. At first you think your reading a romance novel, then a mystery starts to rear it's head and it sucks you in. A very good read.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|even though my granddaughter loves my little pony I didn't let her use this app as it could involve money used for items down the road
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Cannot put it down! Wherever it goes, it's interesting and weaves the story. Tantalizingly you to begin the next chapter. Particularly Great on a trip, it's so long and vivid, more interesting than the scenery.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|I haven't let my granddaughter use this app as eventually it could involve paying for items used in this app
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Great animated series.  Purchased for the grandkids for Christmas. But the grandparents laugh a lot while watching,too.  Fun for everyone.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not so much, I had a hard time figuring out what was needed to knock down the items on the screen.  There is no &#34;help&#34; to help one understand the app
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I always like Piano versions of great music. This talented group of guys plays great stuff and has a wonderful sound. Very creative and worth getting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book turned out  to be completely different from what  I originally expected, but I'm glad it did!  It was such a good read and a great story.  I am in love with Sky and Holder!
B008G12EUY|5.0|Well been a few years and MUSE has come back with a great new album. I enjoy their music and their great style.
B009439HEY|2.0|I have been a hard core Hackett fan for 30 years. I would buy anything he creates. But despite the great production value and apparent passion for the music, I found myself asking; Why? I appreciated the first Genesis Revisited cd because he chose to depart from the originals and essentially create something new. But here the strict adherence to the originals is detrimental to the final product. Especially when the music is so awesome, but the vocal leads are so abhorrent, especially in the case of Ripples. I have not been able to even listen to the entire song, the \\"singing\\" is so just plain awful. Some versions are passable, as in the case of anything Gary O'toole sings on. The simple fact that I have only made it through these cd's once in three months is a testament to how disappointing a release this is.  I look forward to Steve's next, all original cd.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Another Wes Anderson film that is quirky in its humor and relaxed in its delivery. It's beautifully shot and a joy to watch.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I found this on sale at a local music store and the tracks out of the gate really rock. \\"Oh yeah\\" caught my attention for the sixties/seventies sound, fuzz box ftw. \\"Beautiful\\" is also a cool track. The first half of the album is killer. A little too many ballads for me, I would have liked joe and brad to cut loose more. Overall it's still modern Aerosmith... this isn't \\"Get Your Wings\\" or \\"Rocks\\" because \\"Pump\\",\\"9 Lives\\", etc are already in the lexicon so don't expect a straight up 70s-style album. It's a solid album that touches on all there efforts, just throw out the American idol tribute track and throw out a star. Good 4 star album.
1400067820|4.0|I enjoy his observations on risk and things that can break, and things which grow stronger with rough handling. His vocabulary is also incredible, and one needs a dictionary at hand just to make sure you are understanding what he is saying.<br />Overall, a very good but difficult read because it's not easy to grasp some of the many concepts he discusses.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|In this follow-up to Phantom of the Opera, it is a reach on so many levels.  After seeing both Broadway productions, traveling productions and the made for screen film, I have been a fan of the Webber version of Phantom.  I realize that each musical is unique, but this is not one of the great ones you come to expect from Mr. Webber.  The soundtrack does not have a single outstanding song to focus upon afterward to bring back images of the musical.<br />The overall story is great and grows each of the characters Phantom, Christine and Raoul.  The most talented singer from this musical was by the Phantom's Ben Lewis.  The rest of the cast was good, but not to the level expected for this size of production.<br />It was a good attempt by Mr. Webber, but not ever venture will be a great hit.  Watch it for what it is and do not expect too much from this musical.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|Its okay I guess but why is there a vacuum setting? I like the purring cat, tthat's pretty cool. The water noise is okay too.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This soundtrack is a great accompaniment to the film released in December 2012.  I wish it had included some of the other small parts which were within the film.  The entire cast was very talented musically and delivered a high level of performance.  The talent by Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were superb and quite unexpected to come from these two men known more for their brawn than their chops.<br />The reaching out to so many young actors and actresses who were musically talented drives the film and soundtrack over the top.  It will not disappoint to listen to and add to your collection.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved it! Watched it on my laptop and it was great. Can't wait to buy the movie on DVD now!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Nothing quite compares with the immensely satisfying experience if eradicating all life on earth, especially after a long or frustrating day. Kill all humans!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Had never played this game but had heard all the good things about it. It IS addictive. Have got to plan time to play it or I'll play it all the time.
0375805613|5.0|I was a kid when I had this book and was thrilled to be able to share it with my Granddaughters!  I remember being a kid and just being so excited to get to the end of the book to find Grover!
B006H5120E|1.0|I hate this film ! It is nothing but tripe, when I first heard about it i was interested, a movie about the greatest ship disaster of all time. But when i looked deeper and found it was not so much about the Titanic itself, but more on a Bulls*** love story well that lost me for good i have suffered through it ONCE and ONCE only! I will never watch it again and will certainly never own it!!! Just a shame i cant give negative stars
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is like temple run... only 80 times better! great app I love it sooooooo much. I TOTALLY recomend it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It was a little long winded (as are most of his books) but you have to get past that to read such a great story!  Worth the time and reasonably priced for a new release.<br /><br />Side Note:  I would like to see authors of this calibre (and success) make these books a little more affordable for the digital readers.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game made me throw up and have diaria at the same time that is how awesome this game is get this game
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I have and love the previous iteration of the Anker Astro2, which is why we bought NINE more to give to my wife's agents as a gift and one more for me so my wife and I wouldn't have to share.  The big bummer is that the new version doesn't include the USB AC adapter to charge directly from an outlet.  The old version did include the adapter.  I guess I'll be keeping the old one and give my wife the new one :-)  Otherwise, I'd give it five stars.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The setting and subject were very timely. I loved all the characters.  The description of the action made you feel like you were there.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Funny and clean, show this to anyone.  Good Christmas story for the whole family.  Will Farrell and the leading lady do a good job.
1451695195|4.0|Loved that this episode took place inside a neuro surgeon's head.  All those countless randomized, double-blinded, multi-site studies Dr. Alexander had to study and believe in.....then to have this happen to him.  Wow.  I know the medical community in particular has to adhere to strict guidelines when evaluating the effectiveness of a &#34;drug&#34; or a &#34;procedure&#34;....etc.  But if a neurosurgeon who himself was mired down in all those standards and ways-of-thinking....then has this event happen......if he can't convince the doubters that heaven is real and there really is a loving God, I don't know what could.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Eric clapton lines up a killer group of musicians, and the results are better than can be anticipated. The only thing better than the Cd, would have been to have been there.
0393327345|4.0|i was happy.. like new but the description did not say that it was different the same book it was just different because tha pages the teacher used where other pages in my book.. like an upgrade in the book. i didnt know but it was useful
B009NOVCTM|5.0|This copulation is a great example of the changes, and growth the band endured through in their 50 years together. Also a great walk through memory lane as the different eras of their music reflect what was then the current events and moods over the decades.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me glued from the first sentence! It keeps your interest the whole time! This book has so much sorrow in it, yet it has happiness and peace as well.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I got this game thinking that it would be awesome but when I got it the turning did not work to kindle please fix ASAP
B0081KTI0E|2.0|I'm glad I did not spend all the money to go see this at a theater.  It was okay but I will not watch it again!
B007FH9GA6|3.0|There are some changes that the American version made that don't make the film as powerful as the foreign version is. The characters have changed and some of the motivations too. There is a small romance thrown in that the foreign version does not have.  I have not read the series so I cannot say as to how well either did in keeping faithful to them. It is still a good story but I would recommend that you watch the foreign series it is better.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I found this game fun and challenging as each time the layout changes and it is always interesting.  Great for a relaxing game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a fun read that has a strong female heroine. There are hardships that are overcome but it is no where near the end.  I love this book best in the series.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love the size of the jewels and the brightness.  It is a great help when they are larger for people with sight issues.  Fun game to play.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This book is so much more. I love that it has a password option and you create different notebooks of color and style. I use for school and each subject that I'm studying. Also, I have created my own journal to write down my thoughts through each day and I have created a notebook for my passwords just in case I have memory loss. Greatest Notebook app I have ever discovered!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Dont get this app unless you wagt this brain teaser in your life for a week or so! It's addicting!
B008VBYN80|5.0|I like this playing this game, especially when I'm bored. It's a great game, just try it and maybe you'll like it.
0312430000|5.0|I read all three, they were great. Bookseller sent them out in speedy fashion. Excellent! I highly recommend.<br /><br />KO, Minnesota
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun and creative. you get to compete in tournaments and play mini games. you can groom and wash your horse.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Simply put, deftones are the best band on the planet. Their 7th album stands up very well in the deftones library. A fantastic record.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a lot of fun and the new graphics are great. Personally I like the original temple run better but overall this a great and fun game. I would definitely recommend downloading it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Its really cool. On the Google Nexus 7, it looks almost same as original Amazon kindle. The touch screen is much better than Amazon Kindle although the original Kindle gives true feeling of book reading.
B009T3AHDE|4.0|I considered a long time before I bought this film but I'm really glad that I did. The additional information and interviews with the cast and crew was especially insightful.  This film will definately have added to my collection of films by Robert Pattinson. Seeing this film a 2nd time was aslo insightful. Although I had read the book by DeLillo and thought I knew the story, Cronenberg brought a new perspective to the story with the interactions of Packer and the people in and outside of his limo.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|This \\"film\\" was one of most disgusting films the Walters<br />Judson Group ever reviewed.  Individuals giving this film<br />5 stars, oven 4 for that matter - have to paid, were on<br />drugs, drunk, or have some sort of physical brain distortion.<br />And those that were not, well, these are very scary people to<br />be around with.<br /><br />This is a total 109 minutes of waste of valuable time. Many<br />scenes that occur in this \\"film\\" do not correspond with the<br />film in anyway.  If you like seeing sex scenes in limos,<br />including a doctor giving Pattinson a rectal for checking<br />his prostate, go for it - but none of these scenes have<br />nothing to do with the film story line, because, frankly,<br />the the story line loses itself in realities.<br /><br />We gave this film the lowest rating ever in our history - zero.<br /><br />Note:  if you consider yourself \\"extremely\\" intelligent, and saw<br />this film, and gave it more than one star - it was solely for trying<br />to justify yourself to a film that is closest to the lowest common<br />denominator.  Brandon Eli Roman (WJGroup)
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It lags so much and is just unentertaining,  Whatever you do do not get this game especially if you are on a kindle fire or kindle fire hd
B007VUA7VO|5.0|OMG I love this app I can look and see what percent my battery on my kindle is it is awesome I totally recommend this app.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this story. I found myself relating to these characters over and over. Gideon and Eva are a complicated couple but, I've never felt more hope for a happy ending as I did with those two. I can't wait for the third book!
B00AQIZRLS|5.0|My friends 3 yr old loved it. He didn't move from the couch for almost an hour. Was great for a cold day!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is MUCH better than Temple Run. It is very fun and a good app to get.  P.S. The gorilla is scary!  :0
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Kind of like my girl friend this app is great but nags you to get stuff done in this case rating the app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cute. I think this app is very cute. v e r y. c u t e. I n d e e d.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|i really like this game and was just getting into it after 8 floors and then that was it?  am i missing something? i want more floors! (:
B006LSZECO|3.0|I hope she is planning on writing a sequal becasue the ending left you.......the book just ended. The book just left me flat!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Soooooo WOW! The connection made with life, love the world!  I laughed cried and was just amazed by this book!  Thanks for the laughs
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. The graphics are very beautiful. The game is very relaxing. I can't wait until the next one comes out.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|As a senior adult who has been married for 40 years and done a fair share of relationship advising, I found this movie delightful.  It was a good 'Date Night' movie for my wife and I.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|About three-fourths into Wool, I was getting exhausted (The Kill Order variety of exhaustion) and I desperately wanted to understand the big picture (think Lost - the TV series).  A few hours later, pre-dawn, I finally finished Wool Omnibus.  While the story will undoubtedly continue (and is currently ongoing), I am happy with how Omnibus was wrapped up.  So if this were made into a TV series, Omnibus' conclusion can either be a season ender or series ender.  So much so that I don't have a pressing need to read the Silo series right away.  I will get to those parts (currently Part 6 & 7) eventually.<br /><br />Wool Omnibus is very well-written. I think my issue with the superfluous drudgery (I was as worn out as the characters were) and vertical (literally) action is really more because Omnibus is actually comprised of 5 separate books.  So if I read them as separate books, and in increments with time in between, I wouldn't have felt as exhausted and impatient.  Those scenes create the visual of their world, their life and survival as they know it.  If I read the books separately, then it would bring me back to that setting at each instance and would help me appreciate the characters and the story arc better.  Overall, 4.5 stars for me; I highly recommend this book.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The industry seems to generate stuff like this to keep a franchise going.  The plot is unresolved and there is no significant chemistry between the romantic leads.  My guess is, Matt Damon refused to sign on for a worn-out concept so they introduced a (flimsily) related character to keep whipping the dead horse.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing, and it really captures the challenges . A middle school kid which physical. Challenges(like me) has to go through.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I had already been using the free version for whenever I traveled for work ( I need the white noise for sleep). On the free version, I found the airplane sound was the best option for me, but did sometimes get distracted by some repetition in the patterns.  Am very happy with the full version and all of the additional option (especially the brown noise). The extra sounds available on their website are also quite good.  Plenty of options and ways to adjust it to your liking. I was searching for some sort of basic background noise production for when I travel, and both the free and paid version have fit the bill well.  I am glad to have the full version now mainly thanks to all of the additional choices for when I get tired of a particular sound.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so fun!!! I am already on level 10 and I love it sofar! but I need more acorns. anyway it is a grate game! I love it!!!!!! lol
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a good App and it works good. I don't know how many App's there are out there for Facebook but this one works just fine.
B001BPJJ1E|5.0|I watch this movie when I was 14 such a good movie. Also all the great music by Bee Gees
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This App works great. I use it as a timer when I'am cooking and it works great. The alarm clock works great too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put this down for long.  Took no time at all to read it and sent me back to Amazon to get the last book in the series.  So often the sequel lets you down, but not this time.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Using the cloud for picture storage is a wonderful idea.  This app and the free 5Gb storage is a great gift from Amazon.  It makes it pretty much effortless to copy pictures to the cloud drive and then retrieve and view them anywhere you have access to the internet.  All you have to do is install the software on the PC that lets you drag photo files to an upload area to upload them and download the app for your phone and/or tablet to view or retrieve the photos.  You can also upload pics taken on your phone.  Automatically, if so desired.  It's easy as pie!<br /><br />Would like to see some enhancements to the apps.  Maybe adding captions, for example.
B004LROMX4|4.0|I watched it on TV and liked it enough to want to see the next season, bought the Blu Ray so my girlfriend could get caught up....<br /><br />I ended up liking it better this time.  4 instead of 5 stars because of the occasional silly Hollywood liberal writing that just makes you say &#34;really?&#34;, like when the kid runs at the mech to save his dog, which could only result in his certain death... who does that stuff in real life? No one. Yes, I know there are no alien Imperial Walker things in real life, it's the concept, people. Hollywood writers come up with the dumbest things for people to do, that no one would ever do if the situation was real.  This is just one example.<br /><br />Other than a few things like that, awesome series though.  I particularly liked Tom's references to historical events and quotes.  Good stuff.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|We heard Salmon Fishing in the Yemem was worth watching several months ago but the name just never inspired us to fit it into our schedule. Then we decided to watch it and could not find it anywhere. We finally streamed it from Amazon and found the movie WONDERFUL!  It has the depth and quality of classic films. Highly recommended.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Love it.... Well written, clever and witty humor, good characters, cool plots, hot demon chicks...  Everyone I've ever showed it to ends up addicted.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Started it not expecting much, was blown away how awesome it was. So much better than the 90's version. Karl Urban does a great job.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|love this movie. Always get a good laugh out of watching it. If you've never seen it you should. Came in same caseing that most movies do.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations. It will draw you in and won't let you go. It's not just a love story..... it's much deeper, be prepared to feel......a must read!!
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I bought this for my mother for cmas. Great scary movie. I love it because they rely of scare tactics and eerie backdrops instead of gore and shock factor. I wish more movies were like this.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Only downside was even with high speed internet and not choosing HD the movie kept stopping and rechecking internet speed which was very annoying so deducted one star. Movie was very good especially Skrit characters troubles.
0439023491|5.0|I love this whole series. The world that the writer takes you into is devastating and sad but she shows the will of the human spirit to survive is unbeatable. It’s the type of book that gets you thinking and makes you want to read more. Couldn't put it down after i started reading it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This was a great read.  I loved the story.  It made me go see the play and then the movie.  The book was the best one of all.
0439023513|5.0|I love this whole series. The world that the writer takes you into is devastating and sad but she shows the will of the human spirit to survive is unbeatable. It’s the type of book that gets you thinking and makes you want to read more. Couldn't put it down after i started reading it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|For our day and age this Bond is great. It is what it is. If someone finds falt in it, then no one cares about that. It could have been really bad , but it was not. I'm looking forward to my own DVD of SkyFall. Can't say that about other films.
B00797MB0O|1.0|I usually love a good dark comedy, and thinking that the same writing/ directing team that gave us the fantastically witty Juno might be able to do it again... I was completely let down. This movie was a waste of a bang-up cast with a really thin plot. It is just awful to hear people call the characters realistic and the situations relatable. Maybe I just come from a place where we all grew up and got our crap sorted out in a timely fashion with no psychologically intriguing side effects, because the whole premise of this movie was absolutely preposterous, similar to one of Jack Black and/or Ben Stiller's stupid \\"ordinary guys in extraordinary circumstances\\" flicks. It was also similarly awkward to those films. No comedy. Just painfully awkward situations and the most awkward sex scene I've seen in recent history, let's be fair. I felt not an iota of empathy for any of the characters and walked away not liking any of them, or even loving to hate them. I want those two hours of my life back and would rather watch Snow White and the Huntsmen again so I could see Charlize in a convincing role. I would willingly ignore Kristen \\"the human wooden spoon\\" Stewart again for that.
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|This may be the best documentary concerning any or all of the Beatles,  past or present.<br />Poignant, insightful and includes footage of George, his family and his band mates never seen by the public.<br />A wonderful film for fans that will elicit laughs and tears.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|The cast is good and the teddy is even better. I could not stop laughing. I laughed so hard I scared my roomate.
B006S02EKK|4.0|If you're a longtime fan of Robert Altman's comedies  ( &#34;M*A*S*H&#34; is a good example) then &#34;Ready to Wear&#34; should satisfy .<br />Altman has always been a &#34;Hit n' Miss&#34; director ( much like Woody Allen) even to his supporters.<br />&#34;Ready to Wear&#34; is often silly, then subtle and at times almost surreal and much of it's success as a ensemble comedy can be attributed to the all-star, international cast.<br />So, if you enjoy Altman's brand of off-beat filmmaking &#34;Ready to Wear&#34; should fit like a glove.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Will and tommy are great but its too bad  jones doesnt act more in the movie. Regardless it is funny and heartwarming.
B00006AW2J|5.0|&#34;Beggar's Banquet&#34; may be arguably the most overlooked and yet best work of their career.<br />This and it's companion piece &#34;Let it Bleed&#34; make up some of, if not the best, recorded work of their 50 years in the business.<br />A definite must-have for Stones' fans of all ages.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This movie needs a sequel. It is smart and action packed. Story was amazing. Enemies are also great. You will not be dissapointed.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this is a keeper.  this book is the best book I have read in a long time.  sparks has a way of always keeping you so interested.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best app on my device. wish they had come out with it earlier!! played on my friends ipod until it finally came out!
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|I don't think anyone should get this app. It worked for a little bit then quit it is January and it was showing weather from november.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Fantastic way to get just about anything from my PC to & from my Kindle. Including. docs, diagrams, pictures and any combination of these above.
B005GUQYIQ|5.0|Any cat owner NEEDS this book :)  The antics between Simon's cat and the Kitten are typical if you have a multiple cat household :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having recently suffered a personal loss, it was comforting to read the account of what could be going on in heaven.  Makes it easier to accept that your loved one is in great hands in a wonderful place, even if you are not of a religious belief in heaven.  Written by a medical doctor makes it all the more believable and astounding.  A tremendous read.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is a great album! I recommend anyone who likes indie to listen to Imagine Dragons. What an amazing band!
B001EN71DG|1.0|I was lead to believe I would be getting both the digital remasters AND the original releases.  The only reason I blew my money on this was in the hopes I could have seen the same movies that I grew up with.<br /><br />What a rip off.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Ben Affleck did an awesome job with this movie.  I have watched The Town serveral times on TV and YouTube, and now I have purchased the Blue-ray 2-disc Set. Everyone who starred in this thriller played their parts extremely well. A must see and a must own. I've read Chuck Hogan's book, Prince of Theives, and I found The Town to be better. Watch it soon!!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|He has done his homework re history. Where I MUST turn pages quickly to resume reading a compelling book is very descriptive scenes of sexual encounters. Why this is necessary for an otherwise  interesting book is beyond fathom.
0448444216|4.0|Lift the flap books are often made of durable or heavy paper. This is not. I bought it for a one year old. I read it with her but no sure if it will survive. The good news is that it a darling story and she loves all the animals inside.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|this is a great game its is fun and takes up my whole day I really like this game a
B005NNURES|5.0|So deep and tortured. Waters really pulled out all the stops on this one. It's way better than The Wall or Dark Side. The 2011 version includes the track &#34;When the Tigers Broke Free&#34; and it works perfectly into the rest of the album.
B000BVMAJ2|3.0|It's easy assembled and very safe for my 23 month old son but I wish it comes with more pieces. It's a lot expensive if u buy it on amazon. Walmart or target are the best stores to buy this
B007JMW46U|4.0|This is an well known and entaining collections of mysteries to be solved by our colleagues in crime.<br />I found the illustations disappointing when introduced into the Kindle environment because they are rendered(black and white).<br />Perhaps if they were line drawings they would be more suitable to the Kindle situation.<br />As for the text, it is pure Conan Doyle, always appreciated by his adherents.
0061906220|5.0|I think Pete the Cat is VERY cool in his new shoes--love it and so do my grandchildren!  I also like that you can hear the song on the publisher's website so you don't have to make up your own tune.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I Bought this book after having enjoyed watched the movie. I found it hard to put down, although due to the movie I new what was around the corner as the movie I found very true to the book.<br />I think this would be a good ready regardless of your age.
B00003CXXS|5.0|one of the series of movies. if you liked the others you will enjoy this as well. hope 2 see another some day.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I should have read the 1 star reviews because then I would have known that this book was about teenagers and for teenagers.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is well written as far as it flowed well and kept me reading.  I felt it was unrealistic because 18 year old boys are not as mature, understanding, or wise as the one portrayed here.  I thought that given what the girl went through, she would need years of counseling (not just and understanding boyfriend) to joyfully engage in the adult activities that she does.  I hated the way the intimate parts of the story were written, such as where she licked his dimples...um gross...face licking is not appealing.  I don't want to read any more books by this author.
B00004WIDR|5.0|one of the series. if you liked the others you will like this one as well. hope to see another  some day.
0375869026|4.0|This is a terrific book. However I wish Amazon would indicate the age for which it is suitable.<br />I wonder if it is suitable to share with children in a school where there are children with similar disabilities.<br />What do other readers think?<br />Great for parents of these children and for their friends.<br />Jan Hall
B008QTVNUI|1.0|It sounded great - we're partial to the Marine Corp at our house. Bought the pilot and watched about 30 minutes of it; counted at least 10 f-words and finally turned it off in disgust when the second sex scene started.  Wasted my money!  jj Las Vegas
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|It never downloaded so its a little hard to rate this one.I dont understand why but it kept telling me I had no room to download it and I'm sure I do since my tablet is new
B00B2V66VS|5.0|finally it is here! temple run 2. Great sequel to the original which is one of the greatest apps ever!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Just read it. There are so many good reasons to read this book. So many wonderful messages. Can't wait to read the next book!
0525953728|3.0|\\"In all of my deployments, we routinely saw this phenomenon. The higher up the food chain the targeted individual was, the bigger a pussy he was. The leaders were less willing to fight. It is always the young and impressionable who strap on the explosives and blow themselves up.\\" Those words are from \\"Mark Owen,\\" co-author of \\"No Easy Day\\" and one of the Navy SEALs responsible for killing Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />The book is a compelling look at the day-to-day life of an elite SEAL, and I'm sure it's a great recruitment tool for the military. However ... if only Owen had left it at that. Owen (a pseudonym), who claims that he and his fellow SEALs don't much concern themselves with politics, does little to hide his disdain for Barack Obama, and presumably liberals in general -- yet has nothing to say about the \\"young and impressionable\\" Americans who died in the bogus war begun by Obama's predecessor.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The only thing positive I can say is I consistently can see news feed. That's it. Missing ability to edit posts, read messages on pages I am an administrator, can't add or delete people from group, can't post pictures to group pages. All necessary applications. Very disappointing.
B008TT7CXW|4.0|This works great to hold extra/spare SD cards.  I read all the reviews and knew what to expect so I am quite happy with the product.  It is about the thickness of about 3-4 credit cards due to needing to hold full size SD cards.  The main complaint I have is that it is quite difficult to get the full size cards out since they do not have the raised lip on them like microSD cards do.  My plan is to just throw this into my camera bag and/or laptop bag when I travel to have a better place to store my spare cards as well as my microSD to SD adapter that I always mis-place.<br /><br />PROS<br /> - easy to use for microSD<br /> - holds multiple cards<br /><br />CONS<br /> - thicker than other designs since it holds full size SD cards as well<br /> - difficult to get full size SD cards out
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Mila Jovovich is great in any movie! Hot chicks and Guns! what else do you want! All the movies in the series are very entertaining

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire and I do like this app.<br />I usually play it once or twice daily depending on my schedule.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is the type of book you can't put down once you start reading!  I rated it a 4 simply because it was exhausting!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like it.<br />It appears to be quite useful, but I have not used it very much as yet.<br />I think it will be more useful as time goes on.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is great.I fund games like this to be great because you can imagine your own kingdom and make it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like it and because it is FREE, I like it even more.<br />It is quite useful and I am sure it will continue to be so.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun and fairly easy....great for any horse lover.  almost tempted to buy a kindle fire for my mom just so she can play this game I know she would enjoy klit immensely
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is awesome.  I have never been so fully engaged by a book. The perks of being a wallflower is now my favorite book o  all time. The writing style is fresh and wonderful. I felt like I was reading letters from a very old friend whom I have never met. Simply amazing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was highly entertained by Gone Girl.  The story sucks you in, with twists, turns and surprises.  Go out and read it!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books, getting to the real story was the best. I highly recommended reading these books. You won't want to put them down.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Possibly my favorite of all the self-help books I've read. Deepak takes some of the most important new thought concepts as far as they can go, giving the reader a deeper understanding of universal laws. Highly recommend.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Kind of boring until the end. Story was interesting though. Recommend it but not worth the hype. Not really about religion...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, and I highly recommend it to the horse lovers out there. This game is very time consuming when your bored
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game. Good graphics. Challenging. Not a good product to have on your tablet or computer if you have work to do. Very Addicting but I love it.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I got to screen 4, and now i don't know how to get out of screen 4. So could someone write a review telling me how to id love it. Thanks
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|This cartoon is a little off. I feel it is to dark for children. I even cried about seems in the movie.

B009X01D9U|4.0|I got a Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; for Christmas and needed a case for it.  I looked at a bunch of them and finally settled on this one.  I really like it!  I especially like the fact that it rotates  - that has been very usful.<br />The only negative thing I would say is that I had a really hard time gettng the Kindle out of this case - once its in, its in!  In finally was able to remove it but it took awhile.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i have had long time about umm 2 month ,, i was really love it and really enjoy it ,, keep mind off ,, relax ,, and stress me less ,, this game is my favorite lots ,,, gotta love it !!!
B004FRX0MY|2.0|The Amazon mp3 Cloud Player is fabulous but there is a critical limitation with this player. You can only store downloaded songs to internal storage. It seems to be impossible to store mp3s in the external SD card.I have researched this and there seems to be no way to change the download location unless you root the phone.
B0099116AY|2.0|Based on the trailers seen on TV, I thought this was going to be a very funny movie. It was not. Watched it with other family members and they thought the same thing. Movie was actually kind of sad. Actors were good, but story was very lacking. Think my expectations, given the cast, did not meet up with the movie. I would not recommend spending the money or the time on this film.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game was fine until the points kept getting higher and took a very long time to get a new game.
068981528X|2.0|This is cynically funny for adults in a kind of sick way, but pretty shockingly violent for kids. The pig uses jackhammers, dynamite, and other tools to destroy the wolves concrete houses.
B0019O6IWU|4.0|This book was recommended by a good and very long time friend.  It is a thought-provoking analysis of interpersonal communication with a clear and simple framework for enriching our own lives and the lives of others.  Like many frameworks of this nature, it can be learned quickly, but it may take a lifetime to perfect it's application.  I like and enjoy these types of projects!
B009LDD5E0|1.0|I have been a fan and faithful watcher of Glee from Season 1. While there have been some highs and lows over the past 3 seasons I've always been left with wanting more and eagerly anticipating the next season. I was very interested to see how the show would transition from a regular show to being bifurcated between Ohio and NY. While Season 4 has been mildly entertaining, I stress mildly, it just feels all wrong. I am not a fan at all of the new cast members and the played out story lines. Also, the connection amongst them as a cast is severely lacking. There is no comparison to the original cast members. While I love Finn and am happy they have found a direction for him he is no replacement for Mr. Shue. His lack of presence this season is gravely felt as are the dynamics between Will and Emma and Will and Sue. We've barely seen Sue this season and part of what made the show funny and entertaining were her snarky comments and sheer comedic genius.<br /><br />Next we head to NY where we explore the story lines of Rachel and Kurt. Overall, I think they've done a decent job showing their adjustments to college and NY but I abhor the story line of Rachel and Brody. Rachel spent the first 2 seasons pining over Finn and finally being blissfully in love in season 3. Now, in the blink of an eye, she easily falls out of love with him for this new guy?! How are we supposed to believe \\"Finchel are forever\\" when after only 4 months of Finn's much needed soul searching she drops him like a hot potato? I know many people are so done with the whole \\"Rachel and Finn\\" story line but honestly, this is the ONLY reason I am still watching this show. I have high hopes they will reunite this couple. The chemistry between them is undeniable and palpable which is evident since they are a real life couple. I feel nothing when I see Brody and Rachel together and it's a rather boring union for me. The fact that she asked him to move in with her last episode was a complete joke. I mean, really? Not only has she dropped her \\"soul mate and love of her life\\" for someone she barely knows she has completely changed her personality. I know she is now in college and NY and is trying to be more \\"grown up\\" but I don't even feel like she is the same character.<br /><br />Lastly, I've enjoyed some of the songs but this show has and will always be about Rachel Berry becoming a star. How is that supposed to happen when she has sung like 3 songs this entire season? Some of her past performances have brought me to tears and with each passing episode devoid of Rachel singing I pull further and further away from this show. No offense Marley but you pale in comparison and will never be the new Rachel.<br /><br />I highly doubt I would watch a Season 5. I think Glee has over stayed its welcome and needs to do a nice little wrap up of story lines and bow out gracefully at the end of this season.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its not amazing but I could do the stuff they do to create these games so give them some slack
B007BFSYMS|3.0|this is an ok app but I had to rate it . sit is so annoying but I think I can get past that because it was so so.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This little baby really enhances audio when listening from an i-pod or smartphone. Highly recommend!!! I am using the Audio Technica ATH-M50s with this.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|i 'm getting review done now so program doesn 't begin annoying  me to review it. It is highly annoing when that happens. good app tbough.
0142419400|5.0|Young adult fiction at its finest, Anna and the French Kiss is sweet, engaging, and genuinely emotional. It's a book that takes its reader away to Paris (a setting so vivid and present in the novel it's virtually a character itself) and into the shoes of Anna, our well-rounded protagonist, who crushes hard on Etienne St. Clair, a dream boy who actually feels real. Long story short, this book is wonderful. It captures the hyper self-awareness and sharp humor of the teenage mind, and the burning intensity of a first real love. It may not attack issues of social justice or solve the energy crisis, but if this book fails to put a smile on your face, I'm not sure what will. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a day grinning into space after finishing a truly satisfying little tale. AND, this Sunday only, the 27th of January, you can buy it for only $2.99 wherever e-books are sold, which is a pretty darn good deal in my opinion.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Yes, this is on a loop.  there are plenty of sounds and you can download more for free.this will be great for when we put our infant to sleep.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so good, as all of Nicholas Sparks' are.  They are romantic but not to the point of too much.  Not focusing on sex and thats all.  You never really know how he will play out the ending but they can take a turn that you don't expect.  I recommend this book to all.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its even better than tr1 i love the zip lines and the carts its funner  and more challenging than the first and its addicting in a good way and the scenery and graphics are better and one giant furosicous gorilla /monster instead of many little ones get it its also free GET IT!!!
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|The movie is good for the most part and keeps you entertained through out there is also a very surprising twist to the movie that really steps it up a notch. Not very scary as I expected tho
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is awesome because when its cold outside I can stay in and play this game. its interesting and mostly because I love horses
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Bought this for my 2 year old son to watch, but I probably ended up liking it more than him.  I can't believe I missed it when it originally came out, but am glad they decided to re-sell it on Blu Ray.<br />I don't really care that the movie doesn't follow the laws of physics or space, it's just a movie.  It's a good entertaining movie.
B004QX07G4|3.0|If you have seen Ellen's showyou will notice the same &#34;white bread&#34; comedy which is fine if you like that type of book. I didnt learn anything new and certainly didnt feel that she shared anything. Fans wiil enjoy it I am sure.
B005D7ECMM|5.0|I love this movie. The 40th edition had lots of bonus info  Color, focus etc was excellent. Any fan of the movie will enjoy it.
B00B19F3PG|4.0|Good Movie but as usual any time they say that it is based on a true story, I take it with a LARGEa grain of salt.
B0084I9QIW|4.0|only thing negative about this tape which is really not woth talking about is that michael strut aroun like a chicken just a little too much<br />but he is still the greatest of all time and this tape is awesome and worth buying<br />alot of thigs/material in this dvd package<br />get it
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great product if you want to mind your battery. It's really nifty ie, it comes in a variety of colors and other things pretty cool
B0084I9QI2|3.0|anothe awesome dvd by the king<br />get it<br />alot of material /photos of michael in this dvd<br />bad is bad/good<br />i cannot get enough of his dancing/singing
B003B02O7I|5.0|I love John Grisham.  I couldn't put this book down. I can't wait to read another one of his books.
0061673730|5.0|I guess like a lot of other readers there were times when I couldn't understand many passages in this book.<br />The philosophical theses Pirsig puts forward are indeed profound and yet the &#34;travelogue&#34; part of this book - a father and son motorcycling through  a lightly visited yet very beautiful part of America - is a damn great story!<br />Since initially reading this book I have returned to it several times and I always find that the second, third or even fourth  time I read over a passage, the clearer it becomes.  I begin to understand.<br /><br />It's amazing how the author in one breath can delve deeply into certain profound philosophical things yet in the next breath he has you sharing breakfast with him and his son in a roadside diner somewhere in Montana. He does this so well you can even taste the pancakes!<br /><br />Never consider reading this book once only.  Just keep reading it and reading it and reading it ....<br />I'll bet you the words in this masterpiece will become clearer and clearer each time you read it and hopefully, one day you and I can both smile and feel confident that if the messages in ZMM don't totally transform us, they will, at least, make our lives richer and more meaningful.<br /><br />This book is not only a masterpiece, it's pure genius.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Pirsig.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Unpredictable and very good!!! This was a very good book and I see why it was given so many good reviews.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app gives just enough info without being complicated. Easy to manage through the options. I like that it gives weather alerts too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never got bored and always wanted to read more. It keeps you interested and really makes you care for the character's.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Bought this for my 5 year old daughter. Ended up playing right along with her. Very realistic graphics. A lot of fun.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I loved the game and played for like three hours. I then got out of it to do chores in my house and when I came back it did nothing but crash after the title came on the screen. so I thought I downloaded it and it was just a bad download so I deputed it and redounloaded it. well it wasn't the download after all Cuz it did it again. if anyone finds out how to prevent the crash pleese tell me. I loved the game itsself but the crash just ruins it
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I love this Album, it mixes some different beats and lyrics but I like that she is just kinda saying F It in her music now and doing what she wants.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|nice graphics. not cheesy. fun and great way to relieve boring time.user friendly design. love playing.I really hate typing. I am entirely happy with the app. great time playing. enjoying using app.
B0099G3I96|5.0|its so great after so many years that a band can come back together and make great music again. No Doubt has done that and I would highly recommend buying this album!
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I had heard great things about this movie so I figured I'd give it a shot. By the end I was crying like a baby and kicking myself for not seeing it sooner. A must-see!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I bought this on a whim when amazon was having their $1.99 album sale around Christmas and I glad that I did. Its by far one of her best albums and I find myself constantly putting it on as I'm doing things around the house or exercising.
0345803507|2.0|The first of the trilogy was the best, books 2 & 3 were too, too much of the same thing over and over.
B0091REZMW|3.0|it's a great game but has some major issues that could make you start from scratch. which can cost some major money when losing the diamonds you previously purchased that are not refundable. However I think the game is worth the effort.
0345803493|2.0|This book was downright boring, I only read it to complete the trilogy.  My advice... read book 1 and forget the other two.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Rihanna may be criticized for her poor taste in men and the misinformed things she says, but one thing is certain, this young woman can perform!  Incredible album and highly recommended regardless of your musical interest.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I haven't had a chance to get this one broken in yet.  Have had some trouble getting the version I want on the screen, but I'll keep practicing.<br /> Bettie Johnson
B00846REIS|5.0|Looking forward to the next one. Seems like this couple has just as many emotional baggage as the rest of us.
B008OD38JK|4.0|A mixture of synth and orchestral recordings, this is a very satisfying selection of music from the 3 Dark Knight films. Keep in mind, Hans Zimmer & James Newton Howard's original scores were also a mixture of electronics and orchestra, so these re-recordings capture the sound and feel of those dark soundscapes.<br /><br />Don't be mistaken, this is NOT one of those cheap, tinny sounding synth recordings, this is a top notch compilation.<br /><br />A great sounding CD, highly recommended.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|I was disappointed, probably because I read too many enthusiastic reviews, which raised my expectations too high. The book explores technology, symbolism, algorithms, etc but at a very superficial level (when I think what Umberto Eco's would have done with that ... !) and ends up being a glorification of Google.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I use the h4n both with the build on mics and the xlr plug in I connect my rode ntg-2 to it and it produces excellent sound. Definitely the crim dela crim of the external recorder.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I had originally downloaded another app for MahJong, this one is better and can be a little addictive, try it
B004HYDM0A|1.0|dont see it.. you'll get catfished.  There is no movie here.  No Hitchcock.. no drama... just a sad story.<br />The movie goes nowhere.  See the trailer,  the big surprise is ... its all a lie fabricated by a 40 year old woman.<br />She's very sad, is living a hellish life and just needed a fantasy world to get her through her misery.  The goofs on the<br />camera end come off as exploiters.  Sad all around... leaves you with a very empty feeling.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game to waste time with. The  only problem I have  is that I cannot change my user or horse name. But it doesn't bother me much.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love love love love love love this app!!!!!!!!  you have no idea. I love the ziplines! they've been a great add on!
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Our family love this movie we have it on VHS but my daughter ask for it after Christmas to take back with her to college.<br /><br />Our DVD was brand new and the price was excellent
B000UBONPW|5.0|Bought this as I love blues and I love when two artists get together on an album.  Terrific party or driving music.  You cannot listen to this and not smile.  Great album
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|had way more adult content than expected but really funny. I woud ldefinitley recomend it and rent and watch it if you get  a chance
B000VT7AUS|5.0|Bought this and several others during a $5 sale.  Terrific voice and the each song is strong.  Buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have fun with my community and its awesome to see them grow and build all this habitat. We play with in our on family &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I like angry birds so much that I downloaded this to get more levels and have a different experience but it is the same thing over and over and it is not challenging after awhile and just takes up too much of my time with little enjoyment anymore.  I do not even play any of the angry birds series any more because of its lack of keeping my interest.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have always read the Bible. Having it on my Kindle , makes it very convient. I would recommend it for everyone. It is filled with life giving words - our guidebook to Heaven
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Some tracks were excellent and others seemed overdone. Glad I got it, but not in a hurry to get more albums from the same group.
0307346617|2.0|This isn't a story as much as a collection of several dozen short stories.  The entire book is a first person, past-tense recollection of events that had already happened.  Consequently, there is nothing riveting or suspenseful in the entire book.  It hinges on dated pop-culture references, without mentioning any by name, to have some hope having some timeless meaning.  Perhaps this could have been a good companion to an actual story, but by itself it is unremarkable.  On the cover it mentions a movie is being made of this book.  I suspect the movie will be an actual story and consequently have nothing to do with this book beyond the mere mention of zombies.  While interesting in the exploration of how the world might (emphasize *might*) react to such a catastrophe, it is an unremarkable book.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|These are the BEST movies and now having them on Blu Ray makes them even better. GREAT picture, great chapter features and Harrison Ford never looked sexier. Recommend to any Indiana Jones fan. SO worth the price!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett proves once again why he is regarded as one of the best of this era...Fall of Giants is well written and keeps the reader glued to the book. Highly recommend for fans of the World War 1 stories.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|CD WAS SHIPPED QUICK AND WAS RECEIVED IN GREAT SHAPE!  HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE WHITNEY SINGING HOLIDAY CLASSICS!  AWESOME
B0030EWB96|5.0|A virtuoso better than Franz List. Franz Liszt was shown in a cartoon of his time as a pianist impossible to imitate and on occasion touch a key with his long nose, as there were not enough fingers to play all his notes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I rated this show 5 stars due to the excellent acting, writing, and wonderful period scenery/costumes.  The re-playability value is also high; the show's nuanced performances mean that the viewer will pick up different perspectives and angles on the characters and situations from a second or even a third viewing.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|This phenomenal artist is a genius. In so many ways is this true as her virtuosity, technique, humor, and physical show-womanship. She spans the globe in her understanding of an art form generated by African Americans, embraced by others only later.<br /><br />The fact that this genius comes along in the form of a beautiful Japanese woman shows me that we as a society need to work much harder to encourage, support and to fund the Arts for everyone equally.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|It is a totally different history than the movie, but at the same time, is the same... If you enjoyed the movie, you most likely will enjoy this book, it doesn't matter if you know the end, it's kind of different than the movie anyways...
B009LA1QW6|4.0|\\"Paradise\\" is not a complete new album, but rather a continuation of \\"Born To Die\\". So, it is not significantly different, and that's not a bad thing, since \\"BTD\\" is awesome. Out of the 8 tracks, the vocals, arrangements and song structures of 5 of them are basically similar to those on \\"BTD\\". I am referring to the first 4 tracks, along with \\"Gods And Monsters\\". The first track, \\"Ride\\", is my favorite. It has a slow dramatic buildup to a great chorus, and it is backed by a fine string arrangement. Very well done, almost like a Phil Spector production.  \\"Blue Velvet\\" differs from these 5 only in that it is a cover of an old song. Otherwise it sounds pretty much like Lana's other tracks. She does the classic song justice with a beautiful low-key, low-pitched vocal. Of the 2 remaining tracks, \\"Yayo\\" is my least favorite on the album. The melody is too odd and formless, the vocal sounds strained at times, and the arrangement is pretty bare. The final track \\"Bel Air\\" opens with some rather bright piano lines, which at first made me think that it might be too conventional and happy for Lana's repertoire, which leans toward the serious, even gloomy. But it develops into an unusual rising and falling melody with some striking chord changes, and the harmonized vocals are very pretty. It is actually the only successfully \\"different\\" song on \\"Paradise\\", since I consider \\"Yayo\\" not to be a success.<br /><br />What is it about Lana's work that both attracts me and makes me uncomfortable? The answer is that there is an attitude of despair that pervades her work. The attraction of despair is that it frees you from doing the hard work of trying to be responsible and productive. It's easier to choose a life of immediate pleasure and gratification. This goes against the accepted worldview of our society; and that makes it forbidden and therefore all the more alluring. Here are examples of what I am talking about. In \\"Ride\\", she sings, \\"...so I just ride/just ride...Drink all day and we talk till dark.\\" Then, in \\"American\\": \\"You make me crazy, you make me wild...Drive fast...I don't really want the rest.\\" In \\"Cola\\": \\"He's making me crazy/I come alive/All he wants to do is party.\\" In \\"Body Electric\\": \\"Diamonds are my bestest friend\\" and \\"We get crazy every Friday night.\\" In \\"Gods And Monsters\\": \\"I'm living like Jim Morrison/headed towards a f***ed up holiday...It's innocence lost...looking to get f***ed hard...I don't really wanna know what's good for me.\\" And finally, in \\"Bel Air\\": \\"You've got a flair for the violentest kind of love anywhere out there.\\" You see my point? Her characters are aimless, drinkers, crazy, wild, materialistic, ruined, nymphos, reckless. All the things we aren't supposed to be. But somehow, Lana's easy frankness makes it sound like a reasonable alternative lifestyle. This may be her crowning achievement! There are 2 other related themes on this CD that deserve mention. In 4 songs Lana sings about \\"riding\\" or \\"driving\\". And in 4 songs she mentions \\"dad\\", \\"daddy\\" or \\"father\\". To me, riding is a metaphor for escape, and the image of dad is a metaphor for security. So these 2 images suggest to me more avoidance of that dreaded responsible, productive life: \\"riding\\" to run away from it, and keeping \\"dad\\" close for support, just in case you can't achieve it.we talk till dark.\\" Then, in \\"American\\": \\"You make me crazy, you make me wild...Drive fast...I don't really want the rest.\\" In \\"Cola\\": \\"He's making me crazy/I come alive/All he wants to do is party.\\" In \\"Body Electric\\": \\"Diamonds are my bestest friend\\" and \\"We get crazy every Friday night.\\" In \\"Gods And Monsters\\": \\"I'm living like Jim Morrison/headed towards a f***ed up holiday...It's innocence lost...looking to get f***ed hard...I don't really wanna know what's good for me.\\" And finally, in \\"Bel Air\\": \\"You've got a flair for the violentest kind of love anywhere out there.\\" You see my point?

B003K15IF8|4.0|An interesting point of view carries throughout. The author's writing style is formal and suits the main character entirely. Though a sad theme, it becomes a believable one in the manner presented by the author.
B003YCIE68|5.0|All the actors provide the viewers with an escape to fantasy through their portrayal of fictional characters.  Well done for young and old.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is such a great way to keep your brain active and the auto finish is so satisfying. can't stop playing it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This application is fast and easy to use. Accurate current information and forecasts. I recommend this application for people on the go.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Pretty good plot, but Connelly cut a lot of corners in solving the mystery.  Instead of Harry Bosch meticulously reviewing the evidence and finding something that everyone else missed, he resorts to kidnapping and torture to get the lead he needs.  That isn't Bosch's style!  And a couple of plot twists are never reconciled.  All in all, it was fun, but I got the impression that Connelly dashed off this novel in a hurry to make some quick bucks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The amount of entertainment you gain for the coin payed is quite impressive .<br /><br />On a side note; I would advise that when useing this application to enshure you have at least a solid hour to yourself to properly enjoy.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|So far,  so good... we've only recently gotten this app, but it seems fairly easy to understand. We love the sounds of weather and these are good. Living in snow country and hearing only snow for the past month (pretty quiet :) this is a treat! Also good for buffering the sounds of bi-pap and oxygen machines :)
B009O2XY12|4.0|I like this game but it can be frustrating ay times.  I'm just not as good at it as I like to be

B000VE439Y|5.0|How can you go wrong, one of the funniest movies ever made. I am a Christian and am in no way offended as this is not about taking the mickey out of the bible. It is a parallell life and absolutely brilliant.
0765325950|3.0|Well, it's been 20+ years, 14 books, and somewhere shy of 15,000 pages, with Brandon Sanderson stepping in to finish what Robert Jordan began. I'll do my best to avoid spoilers, but it's hard to talk about A Memory of Light without at least acknowledging a few contributions . . . and sacrifices.<br /><br />The first 200 or so pages were pretty gripping, but after that it started to wear thin. There was a lot of talking and a lot of waiting for the end, with one battle scene after another filling space. I get what Sanderson was trying to convey, and I realize he had to establish the overwhelming odds, but I will admit I started skimming through all the skirmishes with Trollocs. By the time I hit the halfway mark, my reading pace really began to slow, and I found myself struggling to get through.<br /><br />Having said that, there were some interesting bits, and some moments that genuinely made me smile. Still, it really did feel like a lot of talking and waiting. Nevertheless, I was determined to persevere. It was around the 600 page mark that I began to see some glimmers of hope. I quite liked the role that Mat found himself thrust into (once he was finally allowed to make a long-overdue appearance; the appearance of the Ogier on the battlefront was something to behold; and the arrival of the Asha'man certainly kicked up the carnage a notch; but the battle scenes really began to feel like a lot of padding. For such a battle-heavy book, I found myself surprised by the lack of 'big' deaths, so deep into the tale. Given the overall carnage, and the simple fact that leaders and heroes should be prime targets, it' did push the bounds of plausibility just a bit.<br /><br />Coming into the last 200 pages, things certainly picked up. The pacing got better, there was a significance to the plot developments, and Sanderson finally pulled the strings on some 'big' sacrifices. Elayne and Egwene both stepped it up, earning their role as equals of Rand, and it was immensely satisfying to see the forces of Light come up with a weave to challenge balefire. Min's role was a little less spectacular, but still with some notable contributions, and Aviendha ultimately had a worthy role to play, despite seemingly being pushed out of the spotlight. Tuon's role was a bit smaller than I expected, but her off-the-page contributions to Mat's planning were indeed crucial to the climax.<br /><br />More than anything, though, I found myself lamenting the absence of Rand. I really did expect him to be more of a . . . well, hero. Instead, after some touching goodbyes, he spends the last half of the book stuck in a cave and swapping dreamscapes with his enemy. Some of the futures they explored were interesting, but dispensed with too quickly to have any real impact. Again, I get what Sanderson was doing, and I ultimately appreciated Rand's master gameplan, once it was exposed, but it took 850+ pages to get there. I understand it's an ensemble story, and I appreciate that Sanderson was left with a lot of loose ends, but some scenes were just frivolous. Sure, most of the characters had strong roles to play, but others seemed to be given a token scene or two just to get their names into the book.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed the first 2 books of the final trilogy, and really appreciate how well Sanderson has managed the legacy, the story was stretched a bit thin. We all know Jordan intended for there to be one last book to end the series, and that Sanderson expanded those notes into a trilogy, but I wonder how much of that decision was creative, and how much of it was sheer marketing. While packing everything into one book might have been a bit rough, I think a two-book conclusion would have better served readers who waited so long for satisfaction.<br /><br />I am glad we got an ending, and I am entirely satisfied with Rand's final solution . . . I just wish we hadn't had to wade through so many Trolloc heads to get there.ying to see the forces of Light come up with a weave to challenge balefire.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|The story. Was the best.  The stories had me from first page what a wonderful mind. Hope for more stories.
B00000JPH6|5.0|A memorable favorite and unique for having no humans in it, with all characters being puppets.<br /><br />The story is set on a fantasy world with 3 suns and a powerful magical crystal.  A thousand years before the beginning of the movie and story, the 3 suns came together in a great conjunction, and a powerful race known as the UrSkeks harnessed the combined light of the suns and the crystal in an attempt to burn out all impurity and perfect themselves.  Things go awry, the Crystal cracks, and the UrSkeks vanish.  In their stead two new races arise, the Skeksis and the Mystics or UrRu.<br /><br />The Skeksis inherit the passion and will of the UrSkeks, but lack wisdom and compassion, and they take control of the Castle of the Crystal.  They maintain their power and longevity by draining the land of life and taking slaves.  When a prophecy is made that their rule would be ended by the elfin race of Gelflings, they killed all the Gelflings they could find in an attempt to thwart the prophecy.<br /><br />The Mystics inherit the wisdom of the UrSkeks but lack will and drive.  They leave the Castle of the Crystal and settle far away in a secluded valley where they live in isolation, practicing their nature magics.  However due to their flawed nature, they remain isolationist and do little outside their valley.<br /><br />The movie begins shortly before the next great conjunction of suns.  Both the Skeksis and Mystics have dwindled to 10 each.  The Mystics have taken in a Gelfling orphan, named Jen, and the story begins with him being given the task of fulfilling the prophecy.<br /><br />The puppetry in the movie is amazing for its time, given how they are all alien characters, from the birdlike Skeksis to the four armed Mystics.  The storyline though seemingly simplistic good vs. evil borrows thematically from Eastern notions of balance and harmony rather than straightforward Manichean opposed dualities.<br /><br />It is a dark movie as there are frightening monsters and scenes about death in it, but I think this does not make it inappropriate for children.  Children very quickly learn that the world is not all light and goodness, and trying to \\"protect\\" them by preventing them from seeing anything else does them a disservice.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Prometheus is a feast for the senses, a grand odyssey and search for beginnings, in the outer reaches of space. Ridley Scott's trademark impeccable taste and \\"eye\\" for sumptuous design is evident in every frame in this film and reminiscent of the best of science fiction movies, especially those genre re-defining and representative films, the always enthralling 2001: A Space Odyssey and Scott's very own, Bladerunner.<br /><br />The visual spectacle of Prometheus is impressive though it does not succeed in the way Scott's Bladerunner succeeded at multiple levels, from the spectacular world conjured up before the camera to the deeply human theme of the story. We do see a reprisal of big questions here with a vision to match the scope of those questions. But Scott's resurrection of a lost world in the cosmos has a thin story line with its initially promising theme languishing as the formulaic story overwhelms the film.<br /><br />Scott has not lost his talent for making his visuals relevant to the ideas that frame this story, its first and last metaphysical/religious questions. The ship perched in orbit on the vast canvas of outer space has that inimitable Ridleyan cinematic quality of conjuring the horror and thrill of seeing a spaceship venturing out to regions where human beings have no business snooping into. We feel the magnificent aloofness and dangers of this mission in those first ten minutes of the film introducing us to the space ship Prometheus and her crew.<br /><br />Prometheus is a quietly intense reminder of what a director of genius can do with the tools at his disposal. Certain scenes in this film stand as impressively and as nobly crafted as any in science fiction films. The other worldly form of the Gods conceived and depicted here is truly spectacular, even inspired filmmaking. The great scene of a figure in white at the head of a waterfall is Scott's own account of a God giving birth to his world, the \\"Genesis\\" of the human species. All this is visually intoxicating. This first scene builds up to another visually breathtaking scene in revolving, swirling, shapes in light at the heart of the mother ship, in the middle of the film, with ghostly images of Gods preparing for an expedition to earth to meet human beings face to face. I wish the story of Prometheus were built around these two central scenes to highlight the themes of the creation myth and the prospective reunion of Gods and human beings as the main strands of the plot.<br /><br />But the encumbrance of a formulaic script rapidly dilutes the effect of this otherwise pioneering and thought provoking film. This great odyssey into space and the initial promise of its grand themes are marred by the script. After an hour into the film, roughly half way, recycled concepts of the mythology of the Alien franchise with familiar scenes and situations make this grand poetic odyssey relatively prosaic. The story of Prometheus rapidly dwindles down to the now familiar horror story of a crew caught unwittingly in a hostile world of predatory aliens. I was hoping that the mythology of this creation of Gods and monsters would have a more expansive premise. If only the film had continued to emphasize the odyssey, this quest to seek out human origins, the mystery and promise of its magnificent opening, this would have been a film for the ages.<br /><br />Even if Prometheus quickly dilutes the sense of wonder that it initially conjures with its stunning visual conception of an early earthly paradise and its Gods, the sheer spectacle of Scott's vision of Gods and the space they inhabit shines through the weak plot. Scott's visual conception of the God-like species, his account of the genesis of human life is undeniably stirring. He has also succeeded in creating the poetic, even religious, pathos of a grander species succumbing to a more primitive, destructive, logic of predators. Scott resurrects this powerful myth that he had brought to life once before with unforgettable pathos in 2019 Los Angeles in Bladerunner but the voyage out to a forbidden planet in 2093 in Prometheus is an empty myth that starts so promisingly.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace, as Dr. Shaw, the archeologist, is cast in the same mold as Sigourney Weaver. She is an intense presence on screen, entirely believable, as the intellectually driven, conflicted, and guilt ridden doctor who will be the very personification of the sort of human being that is alternately envied and admired by the mercurial resident android of Weyland Corporations's Prometheus spaceship, David (Michael Fassbender). Charlize Theron was initially considered for the main part but she is convincingly cold and tragic as Vickers, the director of the mission, in league with the powers that be who have financed the \\"Prometheus\\" enterprise.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender, as the alternately reliable and resentful android, programmed to look after the crew of Prometheus and its larger mission puts together another brilliantly crafted performance. Fassbender is a force in Hollywood and for good reason; there is nothing this actor cannot do. His performance as an efficient but emotionally erratic android carrying out its duties with a growing sense of resentment for the crew is an effortlessly fluid performance. The performance brings out the chilling elegance of David's persona easily making it the centerpiece and attraction of this film. David is fully conscious of the advantages of not being human. His privileged role in this mission in search for human origins is acknowledged in his beaming face. When the crew is in \\"stasis\\" in their cryogenic chambers on the way to their destination he meticulously manages the ship with intelligent efficiency.<br /><br />Promising themes and ideas by themselves are not sufficient to do justice to a film of this imaginative scope. The story has to be built around these themes. It is difficult to stay interested in a cliched, tired, story, after four \\"Alien\\" films, of seeing a reckless crew bring in the slime, the ooze, the gore, to make themselves hospitable hosts for the hideous life forms that take life within them. But those contemplative moments in scenes of astonishing visual beauty redeems this film, in part. The sheer scale and detail of the digital art in display here is well worth seeing. There are scenes in this film that can be put up in museums to illustrate a sense of beauty that is unsurpassed in cinema .<br /><br />Prometheus is a flawed masterpiece that I recommend seeing. As a tantalizingly suggestive excursion into the origins of life and death, Gods and monsters, implicit in the Alien franchise, this film is worth a look.  But the world of Prometheus hardly lifts off in this theological sense as its great predecessor Bladerunner did, and only ends up being a magnificent possibility. Prometheus began with a stirring glimpse of a crumbling God and in the end this is an apt metaphor to describe how the beauty and loftiness of this film and its theme are undone and marred by the ordinariness, the predictability, of its story.  One is left with a sense of regret that the vast conception of this film was not allowed to develop at all.  Prometheus is an imposing work of beauty, brilliantly conceiving an enigmatic God.

His learning is mechanical; he masters languages, techniques. But the spark of questioning is absent. David is thus haunted by the metaphysical quest of \\"Prometheus\\". While he wears a detached, even smug and secure, expression fully conscious of his \\"safe\\" remove from the characteristic human weaknesses that plague the mission and take apart the crew, he is also envious of this uniquely, and endlessly, human quest for answers. He cannot hide his resentment that he will never possess what is noble and free within his masters. As much as we see David condemned to the lonely fringes of his humanoid world the last scene has in it a germ of a possibility that perhaps our judgment of David, his capabilities, his consciousness, and thus his \\"humanity\\" could have been underestimated, by him and us, after all.<br /><br />The characters and stars are uniformly brilliant. But if only there was a worthy story to support Scott's fine sense for the cinema... if only... that was the endless refrain.

There is so much of this the earlier films. But we also absorb the rarified atmosphere of Ridley Scott's excursion into science fiction, the contemplative moments and stretches of astonishing beauty, that make watching this film a rewarding experience.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I did really enjoy this book, although I must say it's the first Clancy book I have enjoyed in a few years. With the corporate (or whatever structure) approach he's been using to writing, his books have been far less than the techno-thrillers we expected with Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October, and Sum of All Fears. In fact, not only has he gotten the technothriller part working again, but he's made vast improvements in his personal relationships narrative. Earlier, when he covered relationships, both romantic and otherwise, they seemed wooden and overly predictable -- now, he's gotten a little edgier and certainly less predictable (as with the Melanie/Jack Jr. relationship, and with the relationship between Clark and the former Russian spy whose name I can't remember).<br />The capability of the Chinese to totally infiltrate the U.S. IT infrastructure was a bit hard to believe -- I come from that background and, I don't think they're able to do anything like that yet, but, maybe......<br />As in all Clancy books, the good guys are too good (at everything), but that's OK for this type of book. All in all, enjoyable.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|Scandinavian films have made their mark on the action film genre with Stieg Larsson's \\"Millenium\\" novels adapted to screen with wide commercial and critical success. Jo Nesbo's \\"Head Hunters\\", a thriller from Norway, filmed in Oslo and the outskirts, in a similar vein, offers plenty of action with that touch of the macabre that is getting to be staple Scandinavian fare.<br /><br />Synnøve Macody Lund and Aksel Hennie, the two leads in the film, play Diana and Roger Brown, a couple living the high life in Norway. Roger is a headhunter with a supplementary vocation, kept secret from his wife, to help keep up their lifestyle. He is in the business of selling paintings that bring him massive returns. The price of these paintings are quite literally a steal for him and one particular business deal promises the lifestyle he has always been seeking for his wife. Oblivious of Roger's underground vocation, Diana seems to like their life. But there is a noticeable emptiness in her life. She tells her husband about her deeper interest in getting a family started. She often tries to get Roger to pay less attention to work, and more attention to their home, their future together as a couple.<br /><br />Roger's voice overs reveal a man tragically caught up in the illusion of devoting himself entirely to the business of making a living, even if it comes at the cost of alienating his wife. He assumes that Diana's interest in their marriage is reduced to her regard for the high life he has created for them. These introspective voice overs, reveals Roger's fears more clearly. The perception that his beautiful wife will move on in her life with someone else eventually rules his life. We now suspect that his get rich schemes behind her back may only be a reflection of his insecurities. He fails to see the obvious: Diana's needs and interests lie closer to home.<br /><br />Synnøve Macody Lund as Diana Brown is a remarkable debut performance. She has a screen presence that is reminiscent of Grace Kelly at her finest (I am thinking of her performance in \\"Rear Window\\" as the glamour woman who is also uncompromisingly devoted to her partner). She has that rare combination of stunning beauty and earnestness that matches the grace of the Hollywood legend. Hennie plays the smug, sophisticated Roger Brown, rapidly spiraling out of control as his seemingly fool proof scheme and living beyond his means, unravels when he meets his match in Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau).<br /><br />The writing and direction are consistently impressive. The film is finely crafted and has the style, snap, and grit of a vintage Don Siegel 1970s action film. Siegel's \\"Coogan's Buff\\" and \\"Dirty Harry\\" are its ancestors. The crisp rapid pace of \\"Head Hunters\\" is one noticeable virtue of the film. The film's polished self-conscious style also packs quite a punch with its  unsettling, gritty realism. There are genuine shocks to be found here for even the most seasoned action film audiences.<br /><br />Hennie is making quite a reputation for himself as an actor in Scandinavia and the wider international film scene, and rightly so. His role here as Roger Brown, husband, businessman, and swindler, conjures up the image of Hollywood actor, James Spader, who briefly came to prominence in the late eighties and early nineties.<br /><br />This thriller from Oslo is another representative of the grand cultural turn in the history of Scandinavian film.

B00285K1KE|4.0|A recent puzzle yet to be solved is the almost universal disdain for Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\". I have seen this movie many times since its first release in 2003 and I have been struck by the wonderful way Lee has resurrected the Hulk mythology. His stellar choice of Eric Bana as Bruce Banner and the CGI created Hulk that personifies Banner's rage and frustration beautifully is but a part of the main attraction. The great Jennifer Connelly, as Bruce's partner and love interest, Betty Ross, is, as usual, at her incandescent best. Add to this brilliant pair, Nick Nolte, cast appropriately as Banner's crazed father, and the always distinguished Sam Eliot, who plays Betty's menacing father, Ross.<br /><br />The story of Hulk's origins, its dark premise for the rage that is constantly within Bruce, is developed with particular attention. The anger is rooted much more than in repressed memories. It lies at the heart of Banner's genetic structure, put in there by an overzealous scientist of a father who has injected himself with a serum he has discovered because he is refused human subjects for his genetic experiments. He is a brilliant scientist working for the government, a department who happens to be under Ross.<br /><br />What is transmitted to Bruce later develops into the full blown syndrome that is the Hulk. The occasion could have been a tragic accident. But as a graduate student at Berkeley Banner puts himself in harms way to save a lab mate who is about to be zapped by a dangerous dose of radiation. Banner takes the full brunt of it and as a result he is subjected to the same force of gamma rays that they had shortly determined earlier as a lethal dose for one of their lab subjects. He should have \\"exploded\\" too but it turns out that what he has \\"inherited\\" genetically from his father, has also remarkably preserved him during this accident. It has allowed him to unleash the controlled \\"explosions\\" of strength in the superhuman power and monstrous presence that is the \\"Hulk\\".<br /><br />Add to this genetic inception and accident for the Hulk phenomenon, the key ingredient that triggers the phenomenon: the anger, borne out of the tragic circumstances around his parents.<br /><br />This foundation of the creation of Hulk is a small part of this film. Where the film really succeeds is in the filmic elements put together with Ang Lee's unerring eye. The chemistry between Bana and Connelly, Lee's wonderful talent of telling the human story while also showing us his wizardry with film technology, the otherworldy quality of the CGI generated Hulk, and his penchant for getting into the heart of the mythology that makes the Hulk story captivating is nothing short of remarkable. There was a chorus of booing at the CGI of Hulk, its apparent overt greenness and its unnaturalness. We see glimmers of this but they are the brief visions of Hulk's otherworldly mystery. The Hulk created for us is extraordinary. It is real, it is human, it takes an admirable hold on our emotions. The criticism is largely unjustified because the purported artificiality stems out of expectations that should have not been there. Simply put, if the imagination of Lee and his crew admirably and creatively differed from what the comic book purists may have had in mind that is hardly a basis for adequate criticism. At any rate the combination of inspired special effects, the touch of humanity that Ang Lee brings to the Hulk story, and Lee's artistically drawing from the darker undertones of this mythical tale makes this version of Hulk a more profound rendition of the story than the so called improved version with Ed Norton and Tim Roth.<br /><br />It takes about 45 minutes for Hulk to arrive on center stage, and an hour for the emotional story of Hulk to emerge. The next hour after that is a tour-de-force of special effects. A glorious chase of Hulk by Ross and his army of pursuers across the deserts of California is both an adrenalin rush and deeply touching; there is thetouch of the tragic in all this spectacle. Hulk's escape from captivity from an elaborately constructed laboratory deep under the Mojave desert, an impregnable enclave, is one of the more kinetic sequences on record in film. The subsequent chase away from tanks, helicopters, missiles showcases Hulk's great invulnerability. But all this is a prelude to the final visionary human piece, and the great showdown between Banner, and his ultimate nemesis, his father.<br /><br />The last scene that promises a sequel of course never came to be. It would have been wonderful to see this team return but it was not to be. A small tragedy in Hollywood and for the audience.<br /><br />Bana, Connelly, were just great. Ang Lee once again shows us the reach of his talent. There is nothing this great filmmaker just cannot do.touch of the tragic in all this spectacle.

B001974DG0|5.0|I remember seeing this movie a long time ago and how much I loved it then.  I decided to read the book this time around and loved it even more than I remember loving the movie!  I recommend this book to everyone, especially if you are a Dean Koontz fan!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Was an earlier model tha that advertised and both the battery and charger were faulty. We have purchased two of these in previoua years and were very pleased with there operation and quality.<br />Looks like they are trying to unload some old models. Requested the replace it with the latest model and was told to throw it away and a credit would be issued.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|this CD is a bit more mellow than his first, but still great music! Good variety and great to listen to for lounging or at the office.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|The the characters were not unique.  The plot was convoluted and unbelievable. A lot of action and scenes that were not realistically tied to the final explanations. The writing was fine and the pace was fast and interesting, but, in the end disappointing.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This is movie is way better than Dredd. It's been compared to it for a while. I gave it a try because I know foreign films are usually better than most films made here in Amer.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved it. I looked past the obvious and became intrigued by the characters and what made them tick and how they became the way they were. Read all three books in 3 days

This is an magnificent work by Adam Makos who has effectively done his homework and places you in the middle of the lives of both Charlie and Franz.  This is an inspiring story and makes you wonder why humans go to war.  By it and cherish it!<br /><br />Mick Corbi
B005FPT51K|4.0|This product is great! Once set up properly. It only comes with the basic directions to set up wifi to use in your home. But after doing some research and googling I found a site that had directions for setting it up to view outside of my home with my iphone. It does have a little bit of a delay using it on 3g but nothing to get worked up about. I did read some people say that it is not possible to use on 3g or outside of the house but I wouldn't give up. The trick is to have the camera connected directly to the router and then to port forward. You find the detailed step by step directions to do this at ibabylabs.com. Don't return this product or allow all the negative feedback keep you from purchasing. I didn't and am so glad I didn't. Being able to see my little one while at work is so great.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Wanted to keep on reading, I didn't like the guy in the first two books, but by the time I got to the third book I was in love. Some things got annoying, the same phrases were used far too often.
B0020BUWX2|3.0|I really liked this book. The whole concept, the flashbacks, and the characters. I'm just not sure about the ending. Not to give anything away but it was so sudden. But overall, good read.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I must admit to skipping some of the steamy parts at this point, they became to deja vu!<br />A little bit too much &#34;lip biting&#34; I think the writer could have been more creative at times
1451627297|5.0|Thrilling, fast-paced, full of twists and turns, based on a day of tragic sadness for our country. Very well done by this creative genius Author, Stephen King! Highly recommended!
B0011WL8MK|5.0|I was concerned when I received this DVD because the back of the case was written entirely in Korean. However, the DVD was fine, with a crisp image and great black and white contrast. Previously, I owned the film in VHS. As for the movie, it is a fine satire of the Nazis at the time they invaded Poland. Although filmed in the early 1940s, the amount of anti-Germany war-time propaganda is minimal. Jack Benny displays his Jack Bennyisms in humorous fashion and Carole Lomard shines.
1423140605|4.0|Full of magical mystery, Super Human (god and goddess-like feats), this book is a page-turner, with something for everyone! Recommend it!

B006LSZECO|3.0|I gave this book three stars but it was a good read.  A little confusing sometimes.  I had a love/hate relationship with Gone Girl.  I did not love the ending but I'm glad I read it.  I would recommend it.
B005OK725M|5.0|It's a good movie for those who like to see a female running the show with skills of expertise... if they can get through sensitive, gory scenes.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Amazing read! Such a great book that pulls at your heart strings. If you want to watch the movie, don't expect this book...the movie is no where close to the intensity  of the book.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|It was a well told story. A few of Hannah's stories didn't feel complete leaving me thinking \\"that's it?\\" at the end.  It reminded me of what my high school experiences were like and I still can't pinpoint what got me through it all. I read the words hearing Hannah's voice remembering the bullying, the rumors, the parties, the reputation I had to deal with. It is a good book I will make my kids read. For people in Hannah's position will need to learn coping mechanisms and really reach out to get perspective. It's what helps me overcome those thoughts.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Unlike so many of the Harry Bosch novels, this one did not leave me on the edge of my seat.  I began to see the story developing way too early.

1451629184|5.0|I really liked the book. I couldn't put the book down. I liked that the author told the readers her every day life as a prisioner in Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard. It's really sad that she was kidnapped for 18 years. It makes you want to learn self-defense. I wish she showed more pictures of her before she was kidnapped. I also wish she put  her kids names in the book instead of their initals. Overall, it was a good book.

B003UYUP58|5.0|I have not read a book in so many years that has had such a profound impact on my thinking and outlook on life. I ran the gamut of feelings with the book - awed at the knowledge of the author, worshipful of those that devoted and gave their lives (Curies) to cancer research, shocked at how some doctors put self ahead of patient, fearful that I would learn something about my own experience (see below) that I didn't want to know, mystified, quizzical, and terrified at what cancer is. The following quote sums it up for me:<br /><br />\\"This image-- of cancer as our desperate, malevolent, contemporary doppelgänger-- is so haunting because it is at least partly true. A cancer cell is an astonishing perversion of the normal cell. Cancer is a phenomenally successful invader and colonizer in part because it exploits the very features that make us successful as a species or as an organism.\\"<br /><br />What I also took away was what a great doctor and feeling human being the author was to undertake such a task on behalf of his patients. In my case, I did not have the \\"luxury\\" of undergoing a normal chemotherapeutic protocol. My oncologist and the hospital that in which I received treatment, conspired to deliver me a massive dose of Cisplatin (100 mg/l2) for 4 consecutive days. Having lost hearing after the second day, bloated, and drifting in/out of consciousness, my oncologist heeded my phone calls that I was ill and did not prescribe chemo on the 5th day. This was a life saver. On the 6th, I went to the emergency room (not once, but twice) before they realized their error. 26 days in ICU, 3 months of kidney dialysis followed by 3-4 months of developing neuropathy as my nerves died, 60% hearing loss, and more than a year of rehab, I'm \\"normal\\" from a cancer that was 95% curable and may not have even needed chemotherapy after the initial surgery.<br /><br />This is one subject that I wished the author had covered in his book and gets very little attention. What happens to people like myself who are permanently damaged by chemotherapy either due to medical malpractice or just the wrong protocol. Where are those numbers in the mortality statistics and how does that play into the overall assessment as to the efficacy of cancer treatment?
1606863622|5.0|I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan and I always read the books before watching the movies.  It is true that the books are always better than the movie, but in this case it is 110% true.  The book is beautifully told.  My favorite portion is the way Nicholas portrays the story of father and son.  You find yourself completely immersed in understanding these two characters and definitely appreciate the way he develops them.  The love story with Savannah is also well told and a the center of the story, but my favorite part is definitely the father son relationship.  I highly recommend this book.  DO NOT watch the movie, it's doesn't due it any justice, as much as I like Channing Tattum; this movie does not compete with this book in any way.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The book is entertaining, but not a book that takes your breath away. I am surprised that it is a movie.
0446547573|5.0|True Love is the kind of love that rises from two people really connecting and accepting each other for who they are despite their flaws and their past.  Alex and Katie are a true love story.  I really enjoyed reading this book.  I read it in one sitting and could not put it down, because I had a feeling it would surprise me in the end; and it totally did! I highly recommend this book because the characters are well developed and you can see the connection.  I loved the character of Jo; it was unexpected and unique and just definitely that friend everyone needs; the friendship is so fun and necessary for Katie.  The descriptions the author provides on Katie's experiences were very vivid and tough to read, but very real to true life stories.  This book is definitely a must-read! Enjoy it :)
0061537969|5.0|I would recommend reading this book - especially if you have a dog and know they are more than human!
0307949486|3.0|I came this close several times to putting this book down and picking up something else because parts of it were just so boring. I mean truly yawn-inspiring. The beginning of the book (by which I mean maybe a fourth of it) went into excruciating detail about the main character, Mikael Blomkvist, being duped into libeling a well-known financier. His journalistic career now in shreds, he reluctantly accepts a job investigating a so-called locked room mystery. A semi-retired and wealthy businessman wants to know who murdered his niece Harriet back in the 1960s and hires Mikael to figure it out.<br /><br />Thankfully, Lisbeth Salander comes on the scene and salvages the book. She is possibly one of the most interesting characters I've come across and I think without her, the whole book would have flatlined. Originally hired to investigate Mikael, Salander then joins forces with him to solve the mystery.<br /><br />The story was plagued by excessive amounts of unnecessary detail and description and long stretches of exposition where the reader is told \\"this happened, then this happened, then he did that and she did this, then this other thing happened\\" instead of letting the action unfold. There is very little dialogue. At times, it read like a news report. Yet I kept reading it, partly because the mystery itself was interesting and partly because Lisbeth is fascinating.<br /><br />The book ends as it began: with Mikael's quest to bring down the financier. The ending felt like a 50-page unnecessary tack-on. Once the mystery was solved, who cares anymore about the rest? I think the story would have been better if it had focused on the mystery and omitted the whole financier thing.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I do not understand the negative reviews of this movie at all. Personally, I think it's Pixar's best movie to date! I think the message is great for children and parents alike. Both of the main characters change and that's the point. Merida learns that her selfishness leads to nothing but destruction and Elanor learns that she isn't always in the right. The graphics are beautifully fantastic and even though there are some dark moments, there are also some funny ones to even it out.<br /><br />As for the marriage issue, I like where the story leads. In most Disney movies, the princess is always seeking to be married and for the man to save her. Merida isn't ready and wants to grow up a little before she gets married, as do the suitors. It seems appropriate for this day and age, when everyone is trying to hook up as quickly as possible.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a wonderful portrayal of 101st Screaming Eagles, 506 Charlie and Easy companies.....my favorite uncle is 92 and a member of  Charlie Company..... I can just imagine Uncle Claude in this!  A Great telling of why these Men and Women are known as The Greatest Generation.  And what they endured so that we are free today!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Outstanding read! Hard SF, the science stands up, great story line.  This was a page turner for those of us that love science.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|\\"Keep the Lights On\\" manages to be both devastating and hopeful, visceral and intelligent. Director Ira Sachs succeeds in portraying a relationship marked by betrayal and dishonesty but underpinned by everyday affection and warmth. In less capable hands the film could have devolved into an morality tale or freak show, but the story Sachs tells is deeply relatable, personal, human and humane. Powerful performances by  Thure Lindhardt, Zachary Booth and Paprika Steen support Sachs' effort, as does the ravishing cinematography of Thimios Bakatakis. \\"Keep the Lights On\\" honors the complexity and nuance of relationships and life in general; for all its sadness, watching it left me feeling grateful and deeply alive.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It was amazing but there was one point in time the it just shut down and lost my progress but other than that it was awesome!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This is the second time I visited this gem and I wondered why I waited so long to read it again. It's one of those books you wish would never end with all the colorful characters and exquisite wit.<br /><br />If you are thinking about trying this...don't hesitate for a second longer...you will not be disappointed.
B0091REZMW|1.0|The term FREE must  mean something different when applied to this game! I would prefer to spend a little extra at the beginning when I buy a game instead of being asked repeatedly to buy more gems to continue playing.

0765325950|5.0|I finally got to read A Memory of Light! And let me tell you: it was FREAKIN' AWESOME!!!<br /><br />Book 1 of The Wheel of Time series was published in 1990, which means it's a series nearly twenty-three years in the making. Now, back then I was attending first grade in good ole Taylorsville, Utah. I didn't pick up this series until the summer of 1999, just before my sophomore year in high school. Still, I've been reading it for more than twelve years. It's been a huge part of my life. I've said this before, but I've learned more about story-telling, characters, plot, writing style, and compelling events from this series than most other things I've read combined! The characters all feel like old friends. To have so many prophecies, so much foreshadowing over so many years and volumes, and now to see them all fulfilled is just surreal.<br /><br />Am I a little pathetic? Yeah, probably. But that unfortunate truth doesn't change facts.<br /><br />The book is fast-paced and packed with stuff. (Nine hundred pages people. That's right!) It's difficult to talk about the plot in the fourteenth book of a continuing series, but suffice it to say that it's comprised of events leading up to the Last Battle, the Last Battle, and a few small things right after. The battle is the bulk of the book and I found myself completely immersed in it.<br /><br />It was fabulously written. Sanderson did a great job of staying on track. There were so many characters doing so many different things all at once, but I never felt confused. I haven't picked up a WoT book in more than two years--since book 13, Towers of Midnight was released--but it took all of two chapters to make me feel like I'd read it only yesterday.<br /><br />I can't even say how awesome this book was! It was full of nostalgia between old friends, inspiring pre-battle speeches, the tragedy of war and losing friends (characters) that we love, and the epic climax that's been promised since book 1. Yet, it was never condescending, quaint or sentimental. It simply was. And that made it all the more tragic.<br /><br />We got to see everything we've wanted to for a long time. Perrin will face Slayer a final time; the wolves will join in the Great Hunt (totally awesomesauce, by the way) Mat will get to make (fantastic!) use of his battle knowledge; Egwene will lead the sisters of the White Tower into a battle that dwarfs the Seanchan siege of Tar Valon; and Rand will march into Shayol Ghol.<br /><br />All the characters we've grown to love--Tam, Davram Bashere, Galad, Gawyn, Gareth Bryne, Brigitte and more will be at the head of armies. Of course many of the women--Min, Elayne, Aviendha, Siuan, Cadsuane and others--have even more important roles in the war.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the awesomeness that is al'Lan Mandragoran. I will be in love with him forever! Yeah, he's just that studly.<br /><br />I, unfortunately, am a weeper, and yes I teared up during huge sections of this book. Most often when they were busy killing off characters that I loved, but also because some of it was so powerful, it took my breath away.<br /><br />For example, there's a part where Aviendha is put in charge of several teams of channelers that will guard the entrance to the Pit of Doom. This is because Rand is sure when he heads in, the Forsaken will try to head him off. The teams are there to make sure he isn't bothered and can focus on fighting the Dark One. Check out this excerpt:<br /><br />High above, the sun shone in a turbulent sky. Some storm clouds, in patches, some deep black, others brilliant white. It wasn't a cloud that suddenly obscured the sun, however, but something solid and black sliding into place.<br />Aviendha felt a chill and found herself trembling as the light slipped away. Darkness, true darkness, fell.<br />Soldiers across the field looked up in awe, and even fear. The light went out. The end of the world had come.<br />Holy crap! Doesn't that just give you chills?<br/><br />The final line of the novel (and therefore the series) is tied to the opening paragraph that is used for every volume, which I thought was beautifully done. The final prophecy at the end of the story was written by Loial, which is heart-wrenching in and of itself. So many times I had to just put my hand to my chest and sigh. Then keep reading.<br /><br />Okay so I really need to be done gushing now. I've waited a long time for this book and it did not disappoint. I'm so sad to see the series end and dearly wish that the late Robert Jordan had survived to write more books, prequels, and spin-offs. I would have cherished every one. Now the world of WoT goes the way of Middle Earth--with nothing more to be written by the original author, and the literary world is a sadder place for it.<br /><br />*Special thanks to the wonderful Brandon Sanderson for taking up the gargantuan mantle and finishing the series in Jordan's stead. He did an amazing job!<br /><br />The final chapter of the Wheel of Time saga is everything we wanted it to be, everything we secretly feared it wouldn't be, and everything I could have imagined. Here's to Robert Jordan and the wonderful, sprawling monstrosity he created, and the obsession it created in so many millions of readers. May the wheel weave as the wheel wills.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Back in October 2012 I decided to make a lifestyle change by changing my eating habits and exercising to get in shape. I wanted to be healthy and look great at the same time! So I started making raw Green Juices/smoothies and recently I started incorporating more RAW meals into my life. I have lost 35 pounds thus far. I just purchased the 30 Day Shred and 10 minutes ago I just finished the fist workout. Let me tell you how great I feel (and by great I mean sore and limping). This tells me that I'm burning something and it is most likely fat! This workout gives me something that the treadmill can't give me and thats the feeling that my fat is melting away. I have twenty more pounds to go and I believe that working out to this daily will definitely get me there. I plan on using this in the morning and the Jillian Michaels Buns and Thighs DVD in the evening.I'll do the treadmill on the weekends. My plans are to get it off and keep it off FOREVER! This is a must have for your workout regimen! I'll definitely update in 30 days to let everyone know the 30 day results!<br />Recommendations:<br />please watch: FAT, SICK, AND NEARLY DEAD<br />please read: Green smoothies books! it is a must to equip your body with the vitamins and nutrients that a hamburger and fries cannot. I have a smoothie everyday and I have way more energy and I'm getting all of my nutrients so when everybody in my office caught the flu I did not and will NOT!

B000N2HBSO|5.0|I had bought the book after watching the movie \\"Lincoln\\" twice and kept it in my Kindle queue for a while, until the flu struck. This must be the first time I actually enjoyed having the flu, since it gave me the chance to finish this engrossing book. The rendition of the times preceding Lincoln's presidential nomination, the attention to detail, and the stories of the upbringing and education of all the members of the \\"Team of Rivals\\" are riveting precursors of the rest of the book describing the more known details of the administration's struggle with the Civil War, Thirteenth Amendment, and all the pressure points of the time. You cannot but sit and watch the growth of a great president unfold together with the growth of his cabinet. Cannot wait to read it again! The book made me laugh, cry, and bound me to go research more of \\"Honest Abe's\\" speeches and stories. Excellent read!

B006JSXYPA|4.0|I loved the movie and the 3D blue ray is awesome. The only thing I did not like was that the digital copy requires an application from Paramount and you cannot download it.
B001RTSPVY|4.0|Great, I like this series and can't wait to watch the rest of it! The dvd's came quickly and no damage.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Innocent by David Baldacci<br />Awesome....great mystery novel.  Characters are authentic.<br />Enjoyed every page of this thriller.  You will too.
B0058YPG1G|4.0|Came just in time for Christmas and was a great gift for my brother who loves tv. I haven't watched the series this far in though.
B00457WZEI|5.0|It's such a great thing to be able to read something so pleasant and heartwarming as War Horse!!  Highly recommended!!
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I loved this record because I absolutely love Chris Cornell! He has the most beautiful and haunting voice imaginable. For anyone who only gave this one star how can you listen to the vocals and not appreciate the range and growth of his voice. I was pretty excited when I heard he'd be working with Timbaland because I knew we'd get a brand new sound. If you only liked Chris in Audioslave or Soundgarden then no you may not like this record, but if you love this guy just for the sheer brilliance of his voice you'd follow him across any genre just because he kills anything vocally that he touches. My fave songs are: Long Gone, Sweet Revenge, Part of Me, and Other Side of Town. Love and Kissys
B0000027RL|5.0|Its Ten. What else needs to be said. One of the best albums made in the last 30 years. Its hard to believe its been 20 years.
B004UPALT6|5.0|I always loved the Evil Dead movies. the DvD plays very well and I'm able to enjoy the craziness of horror and comedy combined.
B0037W68F4|3.0|This album is a departure from the first one. Its good on its own but I made the mistake many other people did, I wanted the original sound. It had the sounds of updated beach rock that has been smacked in the face and made to stare at the Farrah Fawcet poster (you know the one) for twelve hours a day.
B000YAA68W|4.0|Great film! I never read the web comic, but I've heard of it.<br /><br />The animation style unique and very comic like. The story is quite depressing, but it also has very funny moments. I highly recommend this to web comic fans. I give this a four rather the five star rating because it was sorta left open-ended, but I'm pretty sure it continues on in the web comic.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Great work out, enjoyed the challenge and love her encouragement through out. Jillian knows how to get you where you want to be.
0545123275|4.0|Actually 3.5 stars.<br /><br />I enjoyed Shiver, but it wasn't jaw-droppingly wonderful.  After hearing so much about it, I was sure it would be something brilliant.  Well, I was slightly disappointed, but overall I liked Shiver.<br /><br />Let's start off with the characters, because that's always the most important part of a book for me.  I quite like Grace.  She's not some helpless, whiny young girl; no, she's very capable, stoic, and she takes matters into her own hands.  I really admired her character.  I loved one scene, towards the end, where Grace is captured and must use her wits to save herself.  She is a strong, likeable narrator.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't like Sam as well as I did Grace.  I wouldn't go as far as to call him a wimp.  However, his voice just never seemed masculine to me.  He's just very sensitive, and he also seems to lack a personality.  I didn't care for him much.<br /><br />Also, the plot is slow-moving sometimes.  For a while, it didn't seem like there was much going on, but I was eventually drawn in to Grace and Sam's struggle to find a cure so Sam can stay human.  I haven't read a ton of werewolf books, but as far as werewolves go, I think the plot is pretty unique.  The last 100 pages or so are the best; there is a lot more plot development and action.<br /><br />Finally, the writing.  I like Maggie Stiefvater's writing style a lot.  It's lyrical and moving, and she does a great job creating the atmosphere of the story.  I could picture the town, the snow, and the woods very well in my mind.<br /><br />One little thing I didn't like was the fact that Grace's parents are so absent.  I know they are supposed to be kind of out of it, but I just thought it's very convenient that they're hardly ever around.  That got on my nerves.  Still, spite a few dislikes, I did enjoy Shiver.  I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, Linger.  Can't wait to see how the story continues!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Mockingjay was okay. I thought it would have been better if Katniss would have been more of a rebel than a naive teenager.Other than that I enjoyed the whole series.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I played this CD for a month in my car and it took a while to get tired of.  There are some good catchy up beat tunes for alternative and pop lovers.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found this book fascinating and hopeful. I hope there is an afterlife and since this book was<br />written by a doctor it has more credibility than most books of this type.
0385742886|3.0|I was a HUGE fan of the Maze Runner Trilogy and just couldn't put it down so I couldn't wait until The Kill Order came out!  However, I'm really glad that the Prequel came out after because it would have completely ruined the mystery of the Maze for me.<br /><br />I was dissappointed that there were completely different characters than the Trilogy...I loved Thomas, Newt, and Minho, but I got just as attached to Mark, Alec, Trina, and Lana in this one.  I was also dissappointed that more of my questions were not answered.  I don't want to give anything away in the Maze Runner series, but the reasons for the boys being in the Maze to begin with and the formation of WICKED was never fully explained.  I think he tried to explain it in The Death Cure...but I was still left wanting.  I hope that James Dashner will not leave us hanging and come out with one more story to help us connect some of the dots here.<br /><br />Overall the book was well-written and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|Way too much trivial repetative detail. Too much opinion. Not very interesting conclusions.<br />I was hoping to get a more interesting narrative but all was common sense.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is an epic seqeal to temple run1 it is very fun and a good<br />time waster and best of all its FREE!!!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|But there's better ones available.  This one just didn't stand out.  It was okay; just definitely not something special.  I've already deleted.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book is well written, but moves far too slow.<br />A good read to put yourself to sleep at night.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|I never saw the point.  This is another of those, &#34;okay, I guess it works, but so what?&#34; apps.  And another you can do without.
B00821OW8K|2.0|Much like the walking dead this show started out with a clean canvas and could have taken the plot anywhere, but its a sad reality that the writing feels like it was done by a 12 year-old, it is choppy and does not always make sense. Unlike the walking dead it does not get any better. all the same bad acting / writing carries into season 2.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy reading and keeps you engaged all the way through the book. Would recommend to anyone.  Can't wait to continue on to book two.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|What can I say, big Stallone fan but this movie has some great action in it and has some good comedy in it and no better co-star the Snipes the Man, also a great actor.  Have watched this movie over and over again.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Overall a good buy for the money. All the same characters as the TV show. If they made another movie I would probably purchase it
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I downloaded this when it was the featured app of the day for free. It was worth it. Give it a try
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I really enjoy DeMille as an author and have always liked the John Corey series. This one is a little off the mark. It takes an exceedingly long time to get to the meat of the book and then it's over. It starts out as a travel book on Yemen and then transitions into Yemeni history lessons. I'm sure the author did a lot of research and wanted to share it but the story suffers. Also, Corey's wisecracks previously were fun and surprising additions to an exciting story. This time they are overboard and often too corny to be useful. Didn't enjoy the standup routine.<br /><br />Probably would have been a great Kindle single if just the story was told. All the extra filler makes this one tedious.
B00A757EFW|2.0|The controls are a bit clunky and I have a hard time getting pac man to turn at the right moment.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This case fits my Kindle Fire more securely than other cases I have tried.  The elastic corners are much tighter than most.  They really need to be pulled hard to get them around the fourth corner.  Mine gets jostled quite a bit, whether it is because it is at the bottom of my backpack or briefcase, or because children are vying over it.  That baby is not going anywhere.<br /><br />This is an almost hard cover and sort of protective.  It is not bendable and the inside of it is really soft.  It makes it nice to hold onto while reading.<br /><br />The book cover look is really nice.  I have already put it in the book case because I was sitting there reading and then forgotten where I put it.  It looks like leather but doesn't feel or smell like leather.<br /><br />This case is better than others I have seen, especially at this price point, which hopefully will be the regular price now.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Don't know why I waited so long for my first Stephen King book. Thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Everything you'd like in a solitary game. Easy on the eyes with the green 'felt' background.  The auto placement of cards doesn't always put the cards where I would have, but it's easy to move the card if I want to.<br />My only complaint is the ads...every time you start a new hand, you've got to dismiss an ad!  Sometimes there's an X to hit, sometimes a Dismiss button, and sometimes, you've got to tap the screen and hit Skip.  It gets kinda old when you're trying to pass the time, but I guess that's the price to get a free app :)
0345529057|5.0|Great price for all four books. I bought these to send to a friend serving in Iraq, I was surprised how affordable these were- especially with Prime.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is a fun and more diversified game! I have played it several times and have enjoyed it tremendously.  Thank you
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I love &#34;Holiday Inn&#34;! Its a beautiful, entertaining (lots of song AND dance -- and of course, Irving Berlin's epic songs), and is a good movie for ANY time of the year (even though it is associated with Christmas).<br /><br />It was really enjoyable to finally see it in color. I'm no technology expert, but it felt really natural even though up until now I had only seen it in B&W. I wasn't disappointed at all.<br /><br />Didn't get around to watching any of the special features yet, but love the bonus soundtrack CD. Soundtracks to these old movie are so difficult to get.<br /><br />This collectors set is worth it for the colorized version, and the soundtrack.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game!!!! I love it! One thing I wish I could change is that I would take less time to downloadsnd that it wouldn't take up so much space on my kindle fire.
B002H3EUA4|4.0|Neat little bundle of &#34;Christmas Vacation&#34; Griswold & Marty Moose goodies in this tin for any fan of the best holiday film since Bing Crosby tap danced with Danny ___ Kaye!<br /><br />You get 4 coasters w/ scenes & quotes from the movie, a thing of fake snow (the box has Marty Moose on it), a Santa hat w/ Marty Moose embroidered along the edge, and -- my favorite -- a pin that says &#34;I survived a Griswold Family Christmas&#34; w/ Marty Moose on it. The tin also has photos from the movie all over it.<br /><br />The presentation -- with the decorative tin, collectables, and DVD -- makes a great gift, too!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this has got to be the greatest temple run yet! I wonder when they r gonna come out with temple run 3... XD
B00B2V66VS|2.0|For some reason it seems that this game Is not responding when I tilt my kindle. The app seems to run just fine, and it looks really cool, but I am getting really frustrated from this problem. I am leaving it on my kindle in hope that the problem will fix itself. HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEM OR IS IT JUST ME!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I was totally blown away by this movie (had not read the book).  I did start it over with the closed captioning on after about 5 minutes because I felt like I was missing things (accents, soft voices, etc...).  The captioning did not get in the way at all because I didn't \\"read\\" the whole movie, but when I did miss things, it was a big help.
B002361MLA|5.0|This should be mandatory reading for everybody. It is very powerful and will open your eyes to recognize that there is much more to life then we are used to and it will help you understand other people and their problems. U.H.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|had my item in less than 48 hours fantastic service product properly represented and quality was excellent for the very nice price
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard so much about 50 Shades that I decided to purchase it before taking a trip.<br />Needless to say, i couldn't put the book down. Every free minute I had I looked forward to reading it.<br />50 Shades doesn't disappoint.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great app to play.It is way better than temple run 1.I think you need to download this app.I &lt;3 temple run 2.
0553582461|5.0|The book is a little worn, and rough around the edges but that's to be expected. It gives it more history, more personality in my opinion, and over all is a great buy. The pages are all intact, without any tears or burns. It does show its age and much more. This is a great buy for anyone who is looking for a good read.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I loved this movie it is a must watch for any rob fan.  Fantastic storyline and rob without a shirt on enough said.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Quality is great and it is so much easier to follow the story line without the interruption of constant ads
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Great storyline George is such a scoundrel but you love him anyway. The women are great choices. And of course you get to see rob looking all sexy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it the horses are so life like and pretty. I like the games on it.<br />Great app any horse lover should get it.
B009GXHOW4|3.0|I tried it for.pocket edition and when I tried to do 64 torches or 255 diamond pickaxes it wouldnt let me so how do I do it
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this, even more than I enjoyed the movie, and I really enjoyed the movie.  I would definitely recommend this book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 Is so fantastic! The graphics are amazing, the sound effects are good quality, and the game itself is entertaining and fun. I was so surprised when I first played. Imanji Studios has done another phenomenal job! Thanks
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a good book.  Story was very informative and kept me on the edge of my chair in the latter part of the book.  Good writing too.
B00007GZR5|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie a few years back and it held our attention the whole time. Talking about it one day we could not remember the name of the movie. We googled Robin Williams movies and there it was! I went right to Amazon and ordered it. It  was every bit as interesting as the first time. Wonderful portrayal of our human emotions! Definitely recommend this movie.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a good game. If you have a lot of time to not play,sometimes you have to wait 9 hours to do something interesting.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is just flat out awesome... only complaint is the stars. not easily acquired. perfect except for that... woo
B0063IH60K|1.0|I got the app but then cannot get it to download to my Kindle, so I don't know if I would like it or not. And Kindle being a kindle it doesn't give all that clear of a help system on how to do something. Everything else downloads with no problem, this one well I haven't figured it out yet.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book, and I hated to finish it.  I will be reading this one again for sure.  Looking forward to more...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Amazing classic almost just like the film great book a must buy completely and utterly a timeless classic I loved it!
0142419400|5.0|I love this book! I love Stephanie Perkjns, too! I could not put Anna and the French Kiss down. My house fell apart for couple days, and my kids were a little neglected, but it was worth it! Highly recommend!!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Love the game but four stars because it's to hard to unlock new diseases but it's one of the best can get boring but it's one of those games were you get in the mood to play ?!?!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|We enjoyed this movie alot. It is a feel good movie.  The old guy old school no computer or cell vs the young upstart guy will all the new gadgets.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It's a cool game but they tried to hard to make it better than subway surfers disappointed to see you guys make this game you had 3 environments but there not like the ones from the first like you can fall of for leaning and I only played a few round  and found bugs so that's why it got a one
B0053O89IS|5.0|The item was shipped fast with no hassle. Got it for a great price and was brand new in the wrapper. Great Item!!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|A great combination of action, adventure, and romance with plenty of twists and turns. Almost mandatory to read in conjunction with the HBO series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I understand that this book is gaining in popularity due to word of mouth since it was self published by the author and I want to contribute to his success. I am usually pretty picky with my science fiction. If a book doesn't grip me within the first 50 pages I usually put it down and look for something else to read. After reading book 1 of Wool, I thought it was good and kept reading. About halfway through I realized that this book had the potential to be great. Good story, intriguing world building, awesome characters (however I wondered which ones would survive), great writing and just the right amount of mystery. While reading book 4 I thought of calling out of work so I could finish the whole thing as several of my friends had finished the book and I wanted to be able to discuss it with them. My better judgement stopped me from doing that but that didn't stop me from reading whenever I got the chance (brushing my teeth, standing in line, waiting at red lights etc.). I was not disappointed. The book had a great ending and never felt rushed. The ending was very satisfying which has been my biggest complaint from some of my favorite authors (Guy Kay Gavriel, George RR Martin, Stephen King etc.) I'm now hooked and plan on adding all of Hugh Howey's books to my \\"To Read\\" list. This book (the omnibus) was one of my favorite reads of all time. Well done Hue.
B004YXE438|5.0|I can spend hours with these puzzles. I can use my own photos for fun, too but I like the scenic ones that are included or can be purchased.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book felt as if the author needed to put everything that she was unable to put in her children's books into this one piece of work.  It would have read well without a lot of the vulgarity.<br />This book starts and ends tragically  and is not for anyone who wants a pleasant read.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|A decent entry into film by FAMILY GUY's creator, Seth McFarlane.  The notion of a raunchy grown up teddy and his pal goofing around the Boston is fun for the first hour, but gets old quickly without the usual jokes that McFarlane uses to keep the Griffins fun in their TV spot.
B004T32SOK|5.0|I have had no problems using this online storage.  Uploading files and sharing files are very easy.  I would recommend it..
B008MEM24S|4.0|It's kind of brainless but kind of addictive at the same time. You can go back and replay games with different variations and different goals.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great app.  I use it for my Kindle Fire.  Great way to download documents to other programs on my kindle and view videos.
B00633W614|4.0|Story line and the characters pull you in as Archer weaves this tale. Not sure about the different characters retelling the same story from their perspective. At times it seemed repetitive, but you did learn more information about different situations. Series does pull you, looking for the release of the third book in the set.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This show is excellent in the realm of zombie ideals, with real life tough decisions.  However, it could do without the female relationship drama.  But, I guess they cant't make it for just men's entertainment.  Oh well.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|Reviewing this ablum is a little unfair, because I love Peter Gabriel...  And Paula Coles performance with him on &#34;Don't Give Up&#34; stands in my mind as one of the best concert performances..well.. ever!  It's a bit campy by today's standards..  They aren't exactly skilled dancers, but this concert came from a time when musicians wrote soulful intense music...  Today it seems like most pop stars are dancers, showman/women first, and then they get someone else to write their songs performed by an anonymous band...  Peter Gabriels ensemble is talented, dead on...
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Enjoyed the game. Waiting for more new G-5 games to come out. Thanks for all the enjoyable ones so far.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Words can't describe how amazing this was.  I can't wait to start the third book. So much more to learn!
B009VB97EY|4.0|my wife liked it more than I did , but it was good and different, offering a male perspective to things
B005IF5H2S|5.0|I play this album 3-4 times a week. Just like their previous album, the musical arrangements blow me away. You would swear they have a complete orchestra performing with them. The lyrics are first rate, making the album one you will play over and over.

B004UID2LC|1.0|I do not like the way this is set up. It is not user friendly. Even though you can click on recent. They are not my recent. If I want to go back and see a video that i just watched you have to search it all over again.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|If you are a fan of the original Alien movie, this one will not excite you too much, but, given that anything after &#34;Aliens&#34; kind of... well... sucked... this is *much* *much* better. Good cast, relatively good story with some... silly plot holes (Seriously, what was with the crab-man-thing in the cargo bay????).<br /><br />The extras on the Blu-Ray were fun to watch. I was a little disappointed that the original screenplay writer who made the storyline pitch to Ridley Scott was kind of pushed to the back for appearences because he was not a vetted screenplay writer. Also... Ridely seems to drink too much wine... it was as large a character in the behind the scenes stuff as Ridley was... Seriously, where ever Ridley was, there was at least one Wine glass and one Wine bottle...

B005S9EJ46|4.0|Stocked with a plethora of gifted British actors of a certain age, director John Madden produces a fine film full of color and life if a little short of substance.  Deborah Moggach's novel, adapted for the screen by Ol Parker, begins in England with a look at the various characters as they decide how to live out their retirement.  Most are on a limited budget so one option is a retirement home in Jaipur, India.  The on-line information suggests a modern upscale facility in what used to be a glamorous hotel.<br /><br />Judi Dench heads the cast as Evelyn Greenslade, recently widowed and on her own for the first time.  She also serves as the narrator, documenting her days in a journal.  The always fun to watch Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are a couple that you immediately wonder why they are together.  Tom Wilkinson is a closeted gay returning to the area where he spent his early adult years, looking for a former lover.  Maggie Smith is a racist grump looking for a cheap hip replacement.  There are others with their own backgrounds.  Then there is the young hotel manager (Dev Patel) whose modest ruse to lure residents has a noble purpose.<br /><br />Mixing this all up doesn't really deliver much in the way of originality, but watching these veteran actors interact is certainly fun and entertaining.  Madden's visuals are beautiful.  He mixes in the chaotic street life with the color and personalities of the Indian people.  While we can see where this is all going, the trip is enjoyable.<br /><br />The transfer to Blu ray is excellent.  As usualy it comes with a 1080p resolution and an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  When our characters leave grey looking England and land in colorful India, the video display pops as well with an inundation of orange,green, pink, turquois.  The palet is clear and crisp.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio and is likewise excellent.  While the film is dialog heavy, there is enough music and street life to keep the surrounds busy.  Car horns, trains and planes send plenty of information to keep the viewer centered in the story.  An excellent soundtrack plays throughout and is handled well in the transfer.ins and planes send plenty of information to keep the viewer centered in the story.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I don't read a lot of sci-fi, but this book feels like if JJ Abrams directed a really dark Harry Potter film. It's well written. Not a difficult read, but it doesn't feel like a kids book. The content of the book can be dark and disturbing but still manages to draw you in and not let go. Just about every night I found myself staying up later than I wanted to see what happens next...<br /><br />My only complaint is that the last chapter felt a little rushed. Everything else in the book was run over in detail, so it felt like we were flying through sparknotes at the end. I'd still give it five stars though and definitely recommend it to friends.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Started to download this app because I need a new and reliable alarm clock for my android phone. Thought this met my needs until I read the agreement statement. Installing this app allows them to know your location and be able to see your call logs. Why would an alarm clock need such intimate and personal information? Not for me. Plus, it a third party app, not an amazon approved app. BEWARE!

B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|The story line was good, and well-written, but I was appalled by the graphic sexual content. I am a Christian and felt duped and sickened, and could not finish the book, even though I was curious about the ending.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|One of the best JRPGs I've ever played, and I've played plenty.<br />At first I really thought this game was going to be dull and was  abit disappointed, but give it time and it will become so addictive you'll find yourself thinking about it constantly!<br />It will take at least two play-throughs to see everything the game has to offer and it's worth it.<br />The characters are memorable, how often have you watched an anime or played a game like this and had trouble remembering the Japanese names?> You won't do it with this one.<br />Kanji, Chie and the rest are awesome people, the kind you'd want to hang out with in real life.<br />The humor is so good I found myself giggling in fits like Yukiko.<br />If you have a Vita and even sort of like JRPGs, dating sims, quirky fun games, mysteries or just a great gaming experience, you have to buy it!<br />If you do not own a Vita, then go get one! Persona 4: Golden is amazing!
B000HZGNDG|5.0|5* TMI what a waste of my time, just to say i liked it and it is a 5 star in my book. This is the last time i rate a video if this is what i have to go through.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great for killing time. Kids really like to play and interact with the horse. They like to watch the horse run and jump.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the twist and turns of this book. Very easy and entertaining read.  Just when you think you have figured it all out, another surprise awaits.
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|It has to be a virus or something because I am unable to remove the app from my device. I uninstalled the app but it still appears on my kindle, and now it says &quot;unable to open&quot; or &quot;application not found&quot; when I try to click it. I just want it to go away, I tried everything! Ahhhhhh!
1572814349|5.0|Beautiful deck! It really does have gold trim around the edges of the cards & is made of high quality materials. The artwork is fabulous and the deck uses the Rider-Waite system, for those of us who don't enjoy learning a new system for every deck we purchase. This was so worth the purchase & I'd reccomend this deck to anyone.
1567184855|5.0|I found this book some time ago, and now have read the first three books written by Dr. Michael Newton. While I have read many books on near death experiences, reincarnation and the afterlife, this was my introduction to \\"lives between lives.\\" It was fascinating to read about the experiences of his clients, when they recalled their thoughts and feelings after they transitioned from past lives on earth, as well as choices made before this lifetime. In fact, I was so intrigued, I bought the next two books immediately! There is so much material here to consider - truly compelling.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Required for so many applications and its great to have it installed and all that needs it just opens automatically.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The most unrealistic car chase scene ever! Is this a comedy? I was laughing at the ridiculous stunts like two people on a motorcycle grinding down a railing...
0446547573|2.0|I saw this book while shopping for food with my boyfriend and convinced him to buy it for me because the story seemed interesting.  It could have been a good story, too, if this weren't Nicholas Sparks we're talking about.  Unfortunately, he created characters that were too perfect, a town full of perfect people, and wrote a story that was so overdone, so cliched, I'm actually pretty sure I've read the exact same plot in at least 2 other books.  The only reason I finished it was because I started it and I had to finish reading it at that point.  I could easily have written this story (this is why I don't write novels!) - there was no magic, there was nothing interesting, nothing in this book required actual skill at writing.  Pathetic.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a great game but it freezes. It took it 1 day to download and install and it won't even load past the introduction. But the actual game is really fun.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|After seeing the 2012 film, my husband and I wanted to read this book together. It's been a wonderful thing to read together a few times a week - a nice change from just watching a movie! We've been inspired already by M. Myriel. It's beautiful!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a great game but it freezes. It took it 1 day to download and install and it won't even load past the introduction. But the actual game is really fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book hit home for me on many levels. Well written and entertaining the whole way through. Cried at the end.
1907016414|4.0|Girl Trade is an erotic novel by Chloe Thurlow - and it's definitely not for the faint hearted. If you like a lot of romance with your erotica, then this book probably isn't for you. If, however, you like hard erotica with dark themes such as kidnap, almost-forced sex, slavery, then you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />It tells the story of a girl whose real name we never discover, as the book is told in first person. It starts in La Gomera, the Canary Islands, where the protagonist leaves her swimsuit and belongings on the beach and swims out to an even smaller island in the distance. Once there, her life is changed forever. She's quickly thrust into a dangerous adventure, surrounded by men who use her for their own needs, until she's claimed by a sheikh. Then a whole new journey begins, which is full of excitement, danger and subservience. The woman, far from being terrified and desperate to go home, embraces her new life, finds it a wonderful escape from her old life. But will she think that way forever?<br /><br />This is one of the most unusual erotic novels I've ever read, with it's hardcore themes and semi non-consensual scenes. But if you can read a book and totally suspend your disbelief, then this is a hot, unique book.
B005XLN97M|5.0|We were really pleasantly surprised with the the Barbie 2-Story Beach House.<br /><br />It was a Christmas gift that finally 1 month later we've put together. My daughter really wanted to play with her Barbies outside of her room and thought we should relocate the Barbie to the family room which was not going to happen. That thing is HUGE. So we picked this up as an alternative and it is a lot more substantial than the box indicated. Really, if you don't want to add the Barbie Townhouse due to the size or expense, the Barbie 2-Story Beach House is a fabulous alternative.<br /><br />It went together really quick, even with the kids \\"helping.\\" It has all the rooms you'd want, living room, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. And because of the breakfast bar flip to the outside, more than 1 child can play with it without a fight for space.<br /><br />We are very happy with it!<br /><br />(And we were able to find it at Target on sale, plus we had a 20% off all Barbie coupon and only paid $25 for it. Pretty crazy.)
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have heard people's reaction to the stage play from way back in the 70's.  It was always great reviews and vows to see it again.  I have seen trailers, then the song sung my Susan Boyle on the talent show.  I really didn't know the whole story except that Jean was imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread.  I have always been fascinated with the evolution of the European countries.  And I do know that the living conditions were terrible.<br />If I see a film that has a very emotional story line, I might choke up and cry at some point, to the embarrassment of my children and husband when I could drag him to the theater (live on stage and movies).  I did not openly sob, I just leaked through most of the film to the point that I had wet patches on my shirt.  I brought large dinner napkins with me knowing somehow that a Kleenix tissue would not suffice.<br />Needless to say, Les Miserables is the finest, movie musical ever.  I put it up with the King and I, Sound of Music and a few others.  Les Mis fills my heart and the music lingers in my head.  I guess it doesn't hurt to say I ordered the CD the day after I saw the film.  So now I sit and wait for the DVD to come out.  I have it on Pre-order.  Waiting for the Oscars to see how well it does.  I think it deserves all of the Oscars that it has been nominated for.
B007THA4FI|5.0|As a huge fan of her Harry Potter series, I knew I had to read this book as well and I am glad I did. This book is absolutely great. It brings the reader in and also has that london/england vibe. I recommend to anyone that loves other J.K Rowling's books!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Read it in 3 days! Just when I thought I figured it out there were new twists! Great story!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I LOVE The Hunger Games. Collins wrote stories that keep you turning the pages. The electronic copy of this trilogy is SUCH a steal. I recommend it with two thumbs up!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This was a really good story and i feel that it was full of suspense and never got me bored. Just like the maze runner i was always on the edge of my seat
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Hard to put it down.  Can't wait to see what happens next. Dialog very riveting Each character is a story it itself.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Best show ever. once you start watching you wont want to stop. A must watch show for sure..<br />Louis is my favorite
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome. I can't wait to read the next one. The story made me feel for Katniss. It even brought me to tears.
B002KVAB5G|4.0|Classic stones, highlights are Doo Doo Doo(Heartbreaker) and Star Star. A must have. I just wish they had the original LP cover.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was great from start to finish not one dull part. My new favorite. Nothing less than amazing. Period.
B0090XO57C|5.0|I have bought several copies of this series.  Everyone just loves it.  My grandkids range in age from 10 to 10 months.  They all love it and so does their parents.  great series for a great price.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Just ok not the best work of his. Hard to get into the first few chapters jump around a lot. And the ending what about his son.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|A great CD from one of the Blues greatest guitar players!  It doesn't get any better than Buddy Guy Live.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it so much. I have read if 15 times now I can read it forever I love the power of the books. You can't put it down
0553819577|5.0|The first book in the series `the Malazan book of the fallen' is truly breathtaking, as Steven Erikson's creation is nothing short of fantasy at its very best. Inspired, original and so imaginative, the Malazan Empire is so vast and interesting that I was glued to the pages lost within the most amazing world. This fantasy masterpiece is beautifully rich, cleverly complex and exquisitely detailed wherein a world is brought to `life' before your very eyes. The intricate history, (mythology and law) of this creation makes it even more believable and compelling akin to other `great' writers within this genre. A master of lost and forgotten epochs and a weaver of ancient epics, this awe-inspiring writer has produced something of such exceptional caliber as to amaze.<br /><br />Bled dry by interminable warfare, infighting and bloody confrontations with Lord Anomander Rake, the Malazan Empire simmers with discontent. Its legions yearn for some respite. For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his bridgeburners, and Tattersail, surviving sorceress of the second legion, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the dead. But Empress Laseen's gaze has fallen upon Darujhistan. For this ancient Citadel, last of the free cities of Genabackis, still holds out against her. However, the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their hand...<br /><br />This is a tale of archaic cities and ancient people, of mighty stone fortresses and powerful citadels. It is a tale of bitter conflict and bloodshed, of rivalry and fighting for justice and supremacy over all. This spellbinding, magical tale is a thrilling adventure and greatly ambitious work. Steven Erikson fluidly combines a sense of mythic power and depth of world with fully realized characters, and thrilling action so as to join the ranks of Tolkien and Donaldson! Gripping, fast-moving and delightfully dark this utterly engrossing read is hard-edged fantasy, which is absolutely stunning.<br /><br />Huge in scope, vast in implication and immensely, profoundly affecting this is a supremely sublime piece of fantasy fiction. A multi-layered and intricately interwoven magical tale that professes such rich detail and immense plot, panoramic saga! I look forward to reading the next installment within this noteworthy series (Deadhouse Gates).fantasy, which is absolutely stunning.<br /><br />Huge in scope, vast in implication and immensely, profoundly affecting this is a supremely sublime piece of fantasy fiction.

B002W5UVSM|1.0|Amazon's system of applying a star rating to \\"A Confederacy of Dunces' is an affront to taste and decency. They must be thrashed immediately! And me too, for writing this.
B0001I562I|5.0|Childhood memories sometimes aren't as accurate as you thought they should be. This one is! Absolutely excellent choice in movies!
B000784WMW|1.0|Perhaps Mr.Rochester is not as handsome as Timothy Dalton, but at least he shows some passion. Zelah Clark as Jane is a bore. There is no basis for Mr.Rochester being drawn to her. I had to laugh when he called her passionate. She pretty much had one expression throughout.  Save your $ and get the movie with William Hurt.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|And it begins. Pearl Jam bursts onto the national music scene with 10 ...the first studio album for the grunge lords. But it turns out their music isn't what the fans of grunge are supposed to worship at the altar...it's really hard rock. KISS. Led Zeppelin. The Who. The Doors. Neil Young. These are a few of the strongest influences on PJ and its music. Punk, Motown, too many to recall. This is their first album. Get the remixed version. The original is a notoriously soupy mix.

B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the most engaging books I've read in a long time.  Characters are totally despicable but the plot is fascinating.  Although it may be farfetched, also seems to be a metaphor for marriage and relationships that may be more ordinary.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|The story of the small Channel Island and its occupation during WWII, as told in retrospect by a cast of wonderfully delineated characters.  The twist is, the plot unfolds through letters written to a young author in search of a direction for her new book.  The book is extremely readable, even the second time!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I liked her way of writing this and giving it a realistic ending. Very sensitive to sensitive issues. From both characters point of view, it was nicely done.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Action was good... hard to follow at times.  I did enjoy the movie but the ending left me wanting more and when it was over I was like 'that's it?'
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|My son and daughter-in-law were playing this a lot a year ago but haven't responded to my initial invites so I may not have anyone to play with.  Again, it came with no instructions.  So I do not even know if I am playing it right.  Don't think I will keep it on the Kindle for very long.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|Nice packaging and great quality film. Bonus CD is ok, but love the film so much didn't care too much for it.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Given the prevelence of PDF formatted email attachments this was a necessity if I wanted to be able to open the attachments on my Kindle Fire.  Typical Adobe product does not include any instructions.  For that you have to go to their website and even then, they are sketchy.  Their geeks seem to think that their creations are intuitive for everyone.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I don't like it Cuz when my kindle died it didn't save any thing so it should get 3 stars
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love all the versions of the Bible you can download and love the large list of devotionals. Great App! This is a must.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Aristocrats and servants and their relationships with each other. Story lines with twists and turns that include allegiances and broken promises. This is a peek inside another time period.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I totally love this app so if you like the first one you should totally get it. it is a really awesome app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book. So much so that I immediately purchased the rest of the trilogy. The female main character is strong and very independent. The two male co-protagonists have strong moral values, and though strong survivors, they are sensitive and most chivalrous when it comes to their lady love. Filled with action and adventure, love and hate, war and peace, I simply could not put this book down. Kudos, Ms. Collins!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It's a really fun game when you. first get it,but 1 day after I got it,it broke and it wouldn't work at all.
B005TOW9JM|2.0|I'm pretty sure this is their sophomore effort (too lazy to look it up), and I find it hard to express how deeply disappointed I was with this album.<br />Justice seems to have  developed a fondness for electric guitars and other organic instruments since their last album. They seem to have lost interest in the fast sweeps, surging vocal samples, and ominous moods that won them so many instant fans.<br />I am sure I am one among many, many alienated, disappointed people who didn't find more than one or two songs  on this collection worth leaving in my mp3 library.
B0034AHFZ6|4.0|I bought the vinyl addition of of Mayer Hawthorne' Strange Arrangement. Now it says instrumentals on the cover but know where in the description does is say instrumental only. All the great reviews on here were saying how catchy the lyrics are so I was thinking it was just a play on words on the cover. Anyway, I love the music but know if you buy the vinyl it is ALL instrumental and the reviews here are for all formats even though they are very different. It is a nice addition to my collection but now I am going to order the CD so I have the lyrics also.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is not only fun but it's an excellent time killer. I am so happy that I downloaded this app. I. hate this 20 word minimum crap!
076115678X|5.0|Great book. My hair is looking and feeling better. I have found the best regime that works for me. I use the products that are recommended for my hair type
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was excited to read all three books because of watching the first movie. Many friends said that I wouldn't be disappointed
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game! I love horses and horse related games. The thing I like about this game is that you actually get to train and compete in a way that lets you control the horse. The only thing I don't like is the fact its way too hard to get diamonds. (I really want a zebra...or a unicorn.) :)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Totally awesome. Great graphics. It is better than most if their other games, ans the puzzles are totally wonderful. Loved it!!!!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|We had to quit watching the show because there was an issue with Amazon working with Roku players that day.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first time I have read a book by Colleen Hoover and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Good story, very captivating.  I didn't want to put it down.  Kept me enthralled right up to the last page.  Will definitely be reading more of her books if this one is anything to go by.
0062127241|5.0|Pete Townshend speaks to his generation and beyond. Magical insight into the mind of one of the greatest musicians who ever graced the Earth. From his boyhood as a post WWII Londoner, to the profound success of The Who, to today, a living legend among us who's music is the chronicle of so many lives. I thoroughly appreciated his honesty, emotions, stories and narrative in this memoir. Thank you Pete for being Who You Are!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very scary and chilling.  Horrifying to see how a marriage can go from great to bad in such a short time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the best series in many, many years. Super informative. I look forward to the conclusion with great anticipation.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I think that it is ok pulse a lot of people are fat and lazy and play this all day and the hills suck
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Moonwalking with Einstein is a Gladwellian meets Participatory Journalism around memory. Really wonderful read. There were two things that he missed: 1) you don't feel like trying to improve your memory and go through what Foer did, 2) Foer doesn't treat the most important part of memory - remembering what to do - the book is about MEMORIZATION - learning all the Presidents and their birthdates, the capitals of all of Europe, or rivers of China - or the orders of card in a deck or poems by heart. It was a fun read though.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  Sad story line with a wonderful ending.  I truly enjoyed the way the author weaved the story line.  Read the last page with tears in my eyes but yet smiling as well.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I am writing this review because of the nag screen. If I had paid for this app I would be mad.<br /><br />The sounds were of good quality and it will let you multi task. Brown noise was my favorite.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This one is so much better than Temle Run 1 I just got the game now I can't put my Kindle Fire HD down...
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I am on my second time through the book, which shares two of my favorite things in life: running and eating (in no particular order).  The book is 1/3 running coach, 1/3 recipe book, 1/3 story-telling and full-time inspiration.  It has inspired improvements in my running, in my cooking and eating, and in my reading about running.  I made it into the 2013 Western States and what better way to prep than to read (while recovering from a run, of course) words from the master, 7-time winner, former course record holder, Scott Jurek.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|fishdom<br />has always been one of my favorite match three games. this is exactly like the version i have been playing on my pc for years. classic match three action with power ups that are fun. you can earn virtual money to buy and decorate fish tanks. this app never disappoints with crashes or force close. if you like match three action you will enjoy this game.
B000002G7E|5.0|LOU REED, NICO AND THE VELVET UNDERGROUND.  BAND ORIGINALLY BACKED BY ANDY WARHOL. I'M SEARCHING FOR MY MAINLINE, SISTER RAY
B008J05EL8|1.0|Agree with others; already paid good price for basic app, now I have to pay for the most common fonts, too?
B0084TWN9K|2.0|I suppose the point of a short story is to leave you wanting more....to know what happens to the characters.  Too many tales, one after the other, was too much of a downer for me.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|If you want Courier and Times New Roman, you'll have to pay an additional $4.99. I would expect a full price app with &quot;pro&quot; in the title to include these.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Unexpected everything....I am so glad I picked up this book. My emotions we up, down and everywhere in between. Great book!
B00280LYIC|5.0|The best book ever! It is a great book for young readers because it is adventurous and exciting. It is a great book.
B000XXGMU6|5.0|These boots run a size larger as others noted so order accordingly, but they are comfortable right out of the box. I waterproofed them right away (SNO-SEAL) and have been wearing them everyday for the last 2 weeks in rain and snow, my feet have stayed dry and comfortable. Note: these boots have minimal insulating properties (outer leather and a thin nylon lining) so in colder climates you may need thicker wool socks. Overall very happy with the purchase of these boots, they are great for casual dress.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the Twilight series, but I felt like this book dragged on. I still enjoyed it, but I felt like the same could have been accomplished in less words.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This was a wonderful mix between fact and fiction. This book was so interesting to me I found myself cross referencing certain details, and was pleasantly surprised to find them true!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I love pocketknives but there are two problems to the usual ones we see stocked everywhere,.<br /><br />The first is the stainless steel is hard to sharpen once it looses its first edge.  So you need a good sharpener and not just one.  This one's for your pocket or kit, so its small.  But as a supplement to a big one in your home base, it works well.<br /><br />The second problem is what to do with serrated edges. Well this one solves it with a nice big diamond crusted spike to handle those curved edges.  Works like a charm.<br /><br />Moreover, its really priced right. I've bought several as gifts.  Try it!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Surprised by the amount of light this gives you. Handy when there is no flashlight around. Its an awesome application to have on your phone.

1439152802|5.0|I loved this book. The characters were developed well. Going back and forth in time very intriguing. I had a very hard time putting it down. The ending was great. One of the best books I have read in quite a while. I am already looking for another of her books. I just can't say enough about this book!!
B000002G1Y|5.0|John Hiatt it's a genius. A great record made bya a great songwritter wiht years and years in the tracks. Love it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|reading this book made me realize life can make anyone crazy but each person deals with the craziness in a different way...Pat's mom...dad....every character in the book deals with something in their lives....Pat was so determined to have a silver lining when his silver lining was actually he had a full life with so many who loved him.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I dont need to say anything about the brilliant writing of Arthur Conan Doyle: that goes without saying! This collection is great value though, hours of classic mystery reading for less than a fiver... What more could you possibly want? Five stars from me.
1451620829|4.0|Well the book shipped quickly and at a great price.  As for the book itself, lots of whining and you just don't know what is fact or fiction but this is Peter's chance to tell his side of the story.  I wish there was a happier ending with the original 4 but at-least we all saw them reunite which for me was a dream come true.  Who knows maybe they will put aside their differences some day again.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Well written, but the author never ties up the loose thread of this story.  Why is there a contest.  What is the goal of the contest?  What does the winner achieve. Why does the circus need to continue.  The love story is vague and not very compelling.  It would make a good Twilight Zone script, but isn't a very good novel.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|If you enjoyed the previous MIB movies, you will enjoy this one.  The same sarcastic and funny Agent J (Smith), while Josh Brolin will crack you up as straitlaced Agent K at 29.
B009ZG6YPU|4.0|Written in the form of a diary/reports to the researchers in a study. Looks at the change in relationship which the character has with people around him when his intelligence improves from sub-normal to above-normal as a result of an experiment.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its more of an on-rails game but its a pretty good game. good sequel to the first temple run. more added things in temple run 2 which makes it good.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed his descriptions. It was an amazing read and I look forward to reading more on the subject from the author.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Should've went ahead and wrote half the story using all the characters!  I mean...this book was extremely hard to read at times. Hated almost all the chapters except for Jaime, Cersei, and well....that's about it.  Kinda looking forward to Dance with Dragons now. KiNDA
B0072NWKEC|5.0|I read a lot of WWII thrillers and these are simply the best. Mr. Kerr keeps the story moving. I have read them all now and they are incredible stories. I would recommend that you read them in order although you do not have to. It just makes some details of the story make more sense.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have read this book many times, and really wanted to have access from my Kindle. The book is powerful and touching.
B000002IQW|5.0|While there were other bands that put out records after this from the hair metal era this one seems to be the last one worth listening to again and again. Great songs. This was really this bands swan song. They did not have a sophomore slump.
0765325950|5.0|I rushed by Wal-Mart on the way to work one evening to buy the book. When I had time that evening to begin the book; I just stared at it. After so many years this was the last book. I almost didn't want to begin. In 900 pages that would be the end of the journey. I am about 200 pages in and loving it.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Eye opening and disturbing. It was an easy read even though the level of detail was amazing. If you read this book and don't believe it it is not because the facts and their references were not available. One of the most interesting pieces was how our Presidents let zealots on both sides misguide our foreign and domestic polices. It was eye opening for example what Dr. Brzezinski did to the Carter administration and how we are still paying for those misguided policies. It is funny to hear him on Morning Joe in the morning now cast as the liberal sage.

The unit is not made with that great of strength in the housing so I would suggest not taking it in, and out much after putting in the auxiliary outlet.<br /><br />Service is great for the unit, and the people are very nice.<br />I had a dud for a battery, or controller, and they sent me a whole controller super fast, and I really didn't ask for one.<br />Thanks to them, and hope to do more business.

B007EW9ISM|1.0|After reading the reviews, I though this product was going to meet my needs.  I am disappointed.  It's rather large in size, doesn't fit well into one's pocket.  And in my opinion, it's expensive.  I've since replaced it with another.  Glad I did.

B009K0P10K|5.0|I started watching Revenge, season 1 on netflix. It's easy to get sucked in to the story line. There is always a twist, and you'll be shocked at all the secrets, lies and scandal that turn up!
B0076DELIG|4.0|As always the author provides interesting  backround  on police procedures --- in this case the method for handling &#34;cold cases&#34; and how they can be reactivated through the use of updated means of data mining and using advances in science made subsequest to the original investigation(s).  (Autopsy work in particular has been facinating.  This probably explains the popularity of the CSI TV programs..)<br /><br />This is not Connelly's best Bosch novel, but I find it hard to find much at fault  It's all<br />there---struggles with the LAPD heirarchy, problems facing a single parent, picking up on trails of evidence even when there seem to be none, and unpredictable developments that keep the pages turning well into the nght. .
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not the ending I expected but over all a great series. I would recommend these books to anyone that likes to read.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I read this book to see how well Jack Reacher stacks up against M. Connelly's<br />Harry Bosch mystery series.  The plot was believable and technically correct in basic counterfeiting of currency and methods used to prevent it.  It became a bit far fetched when trying to explain how an entire town could be corrupted into going along with its unexplained prosperity and that of it's residents.<br /><br />As a first novel in this series. it was interesting enough to come back for more, I expect there will be improvement in later Jack Reacher novels which apparently only now becoming popular after starting out 15 years ago.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have found it every  easy to order movies and episodes of my favorite shows. I would and have recommended Amazon to my friends.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I don't usually write reviews for anything but I liked this book a lot. I wanted to see the movie even though I didn't really know what it was about, just because I liked the previews. But someone recommended the book to me so I thought I would give it a shot. Truthfully, I didn't have very high expectations, after all how many new adventures can you have floating around in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean day after day. But I was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't get it out of my mind for days afterwards. The ending especially.
030758836X|4.0|I find most novels written by women that try to describe men sometimes off the mark. Things are written about men but sometimes one can't help but suspect certain incongruent moments here and there. After hearing about the success of Gone Girl, I thought I would give it a try. So I began the first chapter and it is a diary entry and so is the second. The only difference or thing very surprising and seriously shocking is how the book is written. Every alternate chapter is a diary note by a character both a man and a woman. I found this kind of writing is very challenging and man did it pay up for the author because the story becomes more engrossing and more detailing as the chapters get on.<br /><br />Gone Girl is a success. I couldn't put it down and even while traveling would be too shocked that something I noticed in women all my life is being written about here. Not all of it is bad now, come on.<br /><br />Fantastic read, I found this book and it's suspense rewarding and the end managed to surprise me. Highly recommended if you feel you're just not upto picking up a new book. You are.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I bought this for a friend who had never seen it.  I was going to let them borrow mine, but decided to just get them their own since it was so reasonable.  Gotta love it!
B003HKN52A|5.0|Have had this DVD for years but the cover is different.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|After seeing the movie I couldn't wait to read the book. Very good book and movie. I would recommend both.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|thought this was amazing! the one thing I can day that I don't like is the curves can be distorting. still love it!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This is a great movie. It doesn't hurt that Nev is pretty easy on the eyes too. :) Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great brook from beginning to end. If you've seen the movie then you must read the book. There are some really important parts that are missed.<br />Can't wait to start the next one!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I enjoy the authors books. This one was no exception. I wish there was a little more happiness but I suppose that is not get style. Overall a very engrossing read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very good and fun game. I really enjoy puzzle mystery games and this one is one of my favorites.  :)
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|this movie is a must see for any Beatles fan as well as a George Harrison fan. All the music is great and you must watch from beginning to end.
B001EBWING|1.0|Since I am in an area that does not have good internet service I am unable to watch the movie I purchased.  I thought it downloaded to the kindle for a period of time to watch at your convience. I will know in the future not to purchase any.

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|always good fun with angry birds, loved this version so much we had a three year old squealing with laughter over the  birds being smashed... good fun!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book because of all the hype around it and wanted to see if it was worth my time. It was. I really enjoyed it. The story line was very good I thought. It was a good romance novel where you want the two main characters to end up with everything perfect and happy at the end. It is one of those books that when you are reading it you get frustrated at the characters because they do not see what they have in front of them. I would recommend it to anyone.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this book makes me want to divide my kindle into the section for kids only and the section for adults only- and have it in BOTH sections. The graphics are great on the kindle, just like the real book, and also Kinney never fails to bring humor to the teen angst... love it!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I was smitten with the first season of this show and had to get the next.  Version 2 is just as wonderful as the last.  The acting is exceptional and  I found myself caring deeply for the characters.  I can't wait to see what comes next.  I highly recommend the whole series.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|always a good app, for the kindle I have found that sharing/uploading photos can be a bit cumbersome, so I normally revert to phone or computer to upload or send things that I should be sending from my kindle...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the twilight before I read this.....this is by far the best one. A defiant Book to must read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Interesting app. Kids like interacting with the horses. Competition events are challenging. Earning the money and gems keep you busy...
B000N2HBSO|5.0|As always, Doria Kearns Goodwin, delivers a great book. Her writing is, as always, very readable even though it's non-fiction.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|After using several different Kindle Fire cases, I have to say the looks of this case is one of the more unique designs. Similar to the [[ASIN:B005I6EU7U Verso Prologue Case Cover for Kindle Fire in Tan]], this case has some leather-like accents to it, where as the tan case is made too look entirely like leather.<br /><br />Instead of a book, this Kindle Fire case reminds me more of a notebook one would buy filled with blank pages to write in. Something someone would use to keep as a journal, or something similar. The marbled pattern is a mixture of soft grayish-blues, tans, taupe colors and browns. There are small gold embossing details in the corners and also going down the full length of the spine.<br /><br />Inside, it is lined with a soft charcoal grey material that has a small amount of cushion to it. There is a pocket on one side for storing small items like note cards or photos. The Kindle is held inside by 4 stretchy elastic bands in each of the corners. After trying out several brands of covers using different methods of securing the devices into the cases, I have found this kind tends to work the best. I've never had any problems with my Kindle falling out from the bands, and they even give you the option to use other devices with this case. Where as the cases with the plastic clips will only work with one type of device and of one size/version.<br /><br />It's a beautiful case that makes for a stunning accessory for your Kindle Fire!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|John Wayne plays George Washington McLintock, a powerful cattle baron. Maureen O'Hara plays Katherine Gilhooley McLintock, the very assertive socialite wife of George, who returns home after two years of being away.  Patrick Wayne plays Devlin Warren, a young cowhand who gets hired by McLintock. Yvonne De Carlo (who many know better as Lily Munster) plays Louise Warren, Devlin's widowed mother. The pairing of Wayne and O'Hara is always a delight to watch. Their characters have a long-standing feud between them - the usual man / woman - husband / wife - love / hate relationship found in the war of the sexes.The story is basic... though not really important to the movie. It's the interplay between Wayne and O'Hara which makes the movie a must to watch, as well as De Carlo's and Wayne's debates and conversations. It's a fun comedy western, the kind that only John Wayne can do. Well filmed, top quality acting, and wonderful sequences make this an all around great movie... an absolute classic... and one of my favorite John Wayne movies. Look for the classic fight scene in which McLintock utters one of Wayne's classic lines; \\"Pilgrim, you caused a lot of trouble this morning, might have got somebody killed, and somebody oughtta belt you in the mouth, but I won't... I won't... The hell I won't!\\"  And the classic mud-hill fight ensues.
B0055MBQOM|4.0|I have a multi-monitor setup at home and at work, and it did a good job of setting everything up so all of the displays look nice and very similar despite being totally different brands / models. For the cost, I wish I didn't have to trudge through a 5000 page tutorial using Color HCFR to calibrate my TVs with it. The software it comes with just creates color profiles on your computer rather than having you adjust your display's settings directly.
B009S33I68|5.0|The book grabs you and you have to know what happens next. The fact that this is real life and the bravery and courage of these young men is unbelieveable!
B008SOS63S|5.0|My husband had mentioned that he liked Joe Bonamassa's music, so I ordered 2 CDs for him as Christmas presents (this CD being as well Joe's Blues Deluxe) and he absolutely LOVED them both.  He has them downloaded/recorded in his &#34;music box&#34; option of the car's stereo system - so he can listen to them whenever he wants to.
1455523003|3.0|`Mother `Theresa belonged to the satanic, illuminati Roman Catholic Cult who burned True Christians at the stake for translating the bible.  So it's not surprising to know Theresa's true character is not out of line with Roman Catholic Doctrine. It should come as no surprise to know Mother Theresa merely served as a distraction from what the Unholy Roman Catholic `church' is really up to. Just as Bush is merely a distraction, a pawn or front man for the wealthy Illuminati banking Rockefeller/ Rothschild banking cartel, so was `Mother'. Why are people so shocked, because the average reviewer is just as `delusional' as Dawkins or Hitchens. The whole world follows the anti Christ or beast and will be fooled by the `whore of Babylon' or the dragon himself. You should read Brice Taylors' `Thank you for the memories' [free from the net] for your eyes to really open up!<br />Also, to clarify a big misunderstanding I would like to point out that the Roman Catholic system has nothing to do with True Christianity, but is merely a Babylonian cult masquerading as Christian. They have a Jesus, but it is another Jesus. Buy the Two Babylon's by Hislop.<br />When a true blood washed, born again Christian acts in such a way I would be shocked, when Mother Teresa or an atheist like Hitchens acts in such a way they are acting in a way that is totally compatible with their godless worldview. I mean, from an atheist perspective, why should anyone have good moral values? Objective moral values can only be accounted for in a theistic universe, not in an atheistic universe where objective moral values do not make sense.<br />Also, by what standard does Hitchens judge Mother Theresa's moral conduct ? How does he know what is good moral behavior and what is not good moral behavior and therefore how can he judge? Its always a problem for the atheist to account for objective moral values, but it is indeed no problem for the TRUE BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN who believes in absolute moral laws! But Mr.Hitchens, Dawkins, Hawking etc do not understand inconsistencies in their own absurd worldview of atheism.<br />As can be seen, objective moral values do not make sense in an atheistic worldview and therefore the atheist like Mr Hitchens must borrow from Christian presuppositions to make his worldview seem tenable.

B007P6VM04|5.0|SMASH did not play well on our Australian TV's- which is a shame, because it is my kind of show...music, drama, back-biting, fierce competition, screwed up people who think they are in charge and the weasely little guy who purposely puts a ton of flies in the ointment to see where it goes. I hope it gets a second season here. But I digress.<br /><br />So having seen the first series- OK I watched it online- not staying up til 12 midnight- I loved and connected to the music. I play it in the car, where I seem to spend an inordinate amount of time...but that means I know all the lyrics and the tunes by now.<br /><br />So if you love all of the above, and the kind of music that someone like Bernadette Peters would sing....BUY IT...and I hope you  love it as much as I did.

B005HSL626|5.0|Ok I don't know why so many people told me that this is a horrible game cuz I LOVE this game! When my uncle would take my brother and I to the nearest Chuck E Cheeses, almost faster than a bullet, I dashed for Fruit Ninja and almost immediately used up all my tokens on this awesome game and I would always ask my uncle for more. The reason why it is so much fun is because of all the blades I could unlock and I had a great time (good times good times) . But now it's not that often because my aunt and my uncle have a baby  of their own, and they need to care for her, and once I found out about it being on the Amazon app store, I downloaded and its awesomeness in a paper thin package was amazing!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book came up as a \\"you might also like\\" selection and I certainly did! It was a quick and compelling read, very well written, with quirky characters; my favorite kind!  The emotional aspects of this book are touching and relatable for a person of any age. Highly recommended!

B007UZO3F6|4.0|I was able to load 32 GB RAM into this machine.  I run it headless as a media server for PLEX and my Roku 2 XS and as a Hyper -V server feature (stripped of some of the 2012 features).  I am running Windows 8 Pro version and am having some troubles with the native power management features.  I have not spent enough time to determine if its my OS or my BIOS setting so I will report back later.  I had some trouble getting the on-board wake-on-lan function to work so I used a Intel card - EXPI9301CTBLK.  Works great.  I use an app on the Andriod marketplace to send a magic packet over my WLAN adapter to power the media server on.

B007XF0X6G|3.0|I thoughty this was the first one in the series. I still need to buy Clash of the titans. Anyway I don't have a 3D blu ray player yet, so I can't comment on that yet. I watched the Blu ray 2D disk. Looked and sounded fine to me. The movies was pretty good. I've only seen parts of this and the first one on broadcast tv and wanted to see the whole movie.
145210655X|4.0|Got this for my little brother and had to look through it myself. The jokes are all suitably cute and should provide the reader (for those tykes to young to go through it themselves) plenty of clever Star Wars related jokes.

0553381695|5.0|I admit it. I was blissfully unaware of Martin until HBO trotted out The Game of Thrones, based upon George R. R. Martin's series of novels. As good as the HBO production is, I wanted to see if the books were nearly as good. They aren't. They are better. As I neared completion of book one, I scrambled to grab the next in line via Amazon. The book arrived in pristine condition and the story rockets on. Looking at Martin's writings and other projects, I'm amazed that one person finds the energy and the time, despite the gift for words he has in enormous surplus, to write so well and so prolifically. I'm highly impressed and immensely pleased.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book diffidently deserves a 5 star rating! From the beginning you were hooked with the way the author let you get inside the narrator's head and hear her inside thoughts and feelings. Getting that chance to develop a close connection with a character in a book is what made the novel so special.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who loves reading in their free time, especially those who love romance and a good laugh.

Though the purchase time was during the latter part of December, the seller was able to complete my order in a timely fashion. Secondly, the package arrived within its estimated time of arrival which was an unexpected bonus. I highly recommend this book and the seller. Though I haven't read it, I have received a fairly lengthy synopsis from my girlfriend about the book and she seemed to definitely enjoy it. The story line seemed great though at times I felt overwhelmed. In the end it is definitely a tear jerker!
B005KJJ4F8|2.0|I'll warn for spoilers right off the bat.<br /><br />  Ok,  I have to agree, this was a really great book.  I enjoyed the story and characters and kept sneaking peeks when I should be doing other stuff.  My problem?  I feel cheated.<br /><br />  I think a book, even a book in a series, should be able to stand alone and this one doesn't.  The author ends in the middle of a jailbreak for crying out loud.  At the very least, you'd think the author would finish getting her out of jail before ending the story. If she had at least made it to Africa to join the doctor I would have been happy, and she could have done it in a chapter.<br /><br />  I'm dying to know what happens, but I'm not sure I'll get the next book in the series.  I'm sure the author will do the same thing with the ending, and I can only imagine how many things will be left hanging. I hate feeling like I paid $9.99 for half a book, when I can find a whole one for the same amount.  Or possibly even two whole ones, 9.99 is a lot of money, and I hate the idea that the author or publisher is trying to sponge money out of me by forcing my hand.  If I'm going to stop partway through a $9.99 book, it should at least be one so bad that I can't finish reading it.<br /><br />  So there's my take.  Cinder's a good book, it really is, and I do recommend it, but be aware that you'll have to pay up if you actually want to find out what happens.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is way more adventure than the original temple run and i can not wait for the third one if they make it.

0767827902|4.0|I ordered the DVD &#34;The Last Picture Show&#34;  because I really enjoyed the show and feel that it offers a bit of nostalgia since I grew up in that era. I would probably recommend it to anyone who inquires about it. It may not be the type of show that the younger generations would like or relate to. The DVD was in excellent condition when I received it and first played it.  I really like the show but I don't know that I could say that I loved it; but then I can't say that I love any movie.

B008C1O8CA|3.0|As a longtime Green Day fan since the 1990's I was very happy when i first listened to the 2 albums recently that they released in 2012 Uno And iDos because they went back to the Dookie Insomniac sound of the middle 90's which was there prime of writing great songs.the albums since the early 2000's had a few good songs but were not good all the way through .Rusty James Fell For You Kill The Dj Let Yourself Go travel back to the Dookie Insomniac sound of catchy melodies and good hard rocking songs. the only complaint is one or two songs from iDos would of been on this album it would be a classic as it is a very good rock album in a time when the music scene is pretty terrible these days I just love 70's- to early 90's rock so that is my music era of choice .any fan of old Greenday will like this album if you just got into the band I would get 39 Smooth Kerplunk first then Dookie Insomniac and then this album to start with a 3 rating for me!
B00004RF8J|4.0|nice item. price is good. couldnt have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.
B008G59IKO|3.0|As i said in my earlier review of these two Green day albums of 2012 if a few of the songs on dos were on Uno the other album released in 2012 then it would be a classic great album . this album is pretty good, Lazy Bones has the classic Green Day harmony singing catchy hook the band was always not given the credit for the good singing and harmonies they have had on there albums,also they are better than the average punk band musically who can only play three chords at best and the singer is mostly a screamer not a singer. they were in there prime a great hard rock band not a punk band. the early albums 39 Smooth Kerplunk had the punk sound and i still love those albums even though i only ever liked a few punk records or punk bands in my life.the band is too well produced and the songs to poppy to be called punk anymore.I am happy with the sound of these two albums it's like 1991-95 again the best Green Day albums and songs .. I give this album a 3 rating like Uno !

140053271X|4.0|I am happy with this eReader from Nook but I would advise to buy the one with GlowLight so that you can read at any time. Don't buy if you wanna read at bedtime with all the lights turned off. Overall its good, portable, well-built and cheaper than kindle.

B001NLKT60|4.0|good story, hard to put down.  Perhaps a bit too much detail in parts though I learn to skim.  Detailing the list of groceries Lisbeth stocks up on is one example.<br /><br />Being an American and basically unfamiliar with Swedish culture, the names of (so many) characters are tough to follow and require patience and continued reading in order to put the character back into the proper perspective, especially when reintroduced a chapter later or breifly mentioned between subjects.

B0015DROBO|4.0|sometimes too much unecessary detail and the names of the characters are hard to follow as an American.  I liked that this book was written, or so I assume, to be part of a series.  It gives something to look forward to as you are nearing the end.  I regret that I am 60% complete on the 3rd (and final) installment.  Larsson is a good writer

B00499QUK2|5.0|What can I say? Instant video was just the evening that my wife and I needed. Masterpiece theater rules! Thanks!
B000002WUD|5.0|I despartely wanted anything that included the songs The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and The Twelth of Never. So I bough this 5 disc set. Foolish maybe but I was never so happy when I got these cd's. Many songs that I have never heard before. Though I bought used the sound was great. It included a booklet and the discs had there own case. Highly recommend.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I could never give this series negative marks! The writing is simply superb. Steven Moffat is a skilled writer, as is also evident from the Sherlock series.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great flick. The acting is well done and the period looks accurately depicted. The story sucked me in, the characters kept me interested, and the outcome left me satisfied.<br /><br />Was a bit hesitant because my wife recommended we watch this......... I should start listening to her more often :)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great - one of the best games ever.  It is habit forming, keeps theirs sharp, and it is just a lot  of fun
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I get a &#34;Download interrupted&#34; message every time I try to download a book. In addition, I can't find any help with it on the help site.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun and I really feel like I am there petting the horse! I definitely recommend this game for everyone(:
B0010VHXOE|5.0|Well, finally added Life In Slow Motion to my \\"now complete collection\\" of David Gray's music (minus the Live at the Artists Den DVD).  And through Amazon, I selected recently his DVD Live at the Point to give me a concert perspective. And having never seen David live, it's the next best thing.  The reviews of LISM seems to revolve around the protection issue and where/how you play this disk.  Hey, it works great in my car. It works great on my stereo system at home. What more do you need?  Just bypass the computer/ipod download whatever, and just enjoy this great body of work!<br />I'm not going to go into all the songs on this album.  But let me say that when I listened to the first 30 seconds of the first song, Alibi, I was drawn in by David's emotional greatness. I knew that this album was going to satisfy my thirst for his musical genius. His voice, songwriting and lyrics never cease to blow me away.  And that is what draws me to his music.  Every album is a musical tour de force.  And Life in Slow Motion captures everything I need from this gifted musician.<br /><br />So, if you haven't added some of his newer works, such as Draw The Line, buy them. No live concert footage? Buy Live At The Point. Or are you just sitting on your only copy of David's work, say White Ladder, then do yourself a favor, and buy them all.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Absolutely fantastic movie.  Sometimes the movies produced by Christian filmmakers have so much cheesiness I can barely stand to watch them even though the plot could be great.  Not so with this one, there was humor, suspense, depth, and the acting was really pretty much top notch.<br />I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved the story, if you realy read through the BDSM it's a story about true love, and sacrifice, about braking old patterns.<br /><br />However, it should be read by people who already have more experiencie (not kids who are starting, because in a way it can cause a little confusion. (Isn't that what happened to Christian?)
B0034G4P1W|3.0|I like a a cartoon with two levels, action and fun for the kids and a lot of good clean wittiness for the adults.  It was a cute plot but just not enough wit and humor to keep me interested.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs From the Stage is Susan Boyle's very best album!  She sings with love for these songs and she really gets the chance to belt them out!!  She sings with such emotion and power that one just can't help but love her interpretations.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves good music and a phenominal voice!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Bought this movie for my husband but I actually liked this sci fi as much as him.<br />Great movie although don't watch it right before bed or you'll be too wound to sleep!  I loved the suspense and thrill and I especially loved the themes of recognizing the patriotism and bravery of veterans, the selflessness and sacrifice of the servicemen and women, and the honor given to marriage.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|I absolutely love this cd! It has been in the player of my vehicle since the day I received it (about a month now) & I listen to it all the time.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|One viewing is all I could take.  It made me realize again the horrible suffering the animals endured through this and all wars and while that is not to be compared to human suffering, I had a hard time sleeping for a few nights after watching it, realizing just how lost and depraved mankind, without God's love in their hearts, can be to all of His creation.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the whole series...of course some of the sex will be too much for some people...but the best part for me is the way they communicate...loved the e-mails between them...it was way fun to read...<br />Highly recommend if you are not too much of a prude...the sex will bother some people
B0084IG7KC|5.0|One of the better movies out lately!  If you watch the movie be sure to read the book.  AWESOME MOVIE!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun game! very relaxing and actually makes u feel like ur really riding and training horses. i would suggest this to anyone.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|I have been going mad trying to find where my downloads were being stored on my kindle vs. This app was recommended &amp; I decided to try it. As someone else mentioned,I couldn't find the app at first either. A few days later,there it was. I opened it &amp; about wept with joy! All those pdf files I had downloaded,opened &amp; had promptly disappeared when I navigated away, were right there,as they should be,in a file called download. THANK YOU
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|It was fun at first then kind of gets old.  The red background is kind of hard to see in some of the levels.  Eats up the phone battery.  But fun enough.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this temple run is hard but challenging which make you like it I would definitely recommend. it. for any age.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Just loved this book! And it just leaves me wanting more and more. Sure hope there is another one soon...very soon.

1449415881|5.0|Good daily laugh.  Dilbert is almost as entertaining as politics, but is much more intelligent.  Good way to start off the day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|it wasn't at all what I expected, but that's a good thing.  It kind of left you hanging so I had to get the second book right away.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Definitely not your typical novel and the beginning may have been somewhat slow, but it has quickly become one of my all-time favorites.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is the first book I read on my kindle fire. The reason I picked this book is it sounded fun.  It was a fun book to read and kept me interested. I would read more books by this author.

0545265355|1.0|(Note: I also posted this in the page for the first book itself, but it seems almost no-one visits there.)<br /><br />After reading the first few chapters, I added a supportive comment to a review that was basically disgusted by the whole concepts of adolescents slaughtering each other in \\"games.\\" Then I thought \\"wait, maybe there is a deeper way to look at this, let's see\\" and read the rest of it. No. It's sick, and not redeemed by the cutesy ending.<br /><br />There are two huge problems. First, how is the reader to take it? If we can roll with it and just follow the narrative as with any other story, mustn't we be horrendously desensitized and unempathic - practically psychopathic? Sadly, that is probably true of many today raised on our media's diet of uncaring violence. I had to keep a distance and view the thing as a peculiar object, not as something to be drawn into. Second, how realistic is it that even having endured the crushing deprivation of their status and the \\"tributes\\" for decades, the people of the districts would have been as glacial in emotion as Katniss and the others are described in their preparation and early stages of the combat?  Can denial be so extreme? Yes, as the reality of the deaths hits, she begins to experience something like a normal reaction, but it's little and late. Unless - and this is truly unpleasant to contemplate - her bland acceptance of the whole thing mirrors today's young. If so, no wonder we have mass shootings.<br /><br />I was wondering if underneath the smoothly-crafted nastiness we were being made to re-examine ourselves and realize how degraded our tastes have become. But I didn't get any sense of that. I don't think Aristotle would have accorded this the mantle of tragedy:  no catharsis here for the 21st century's jaded palate.<br /><br />Yes I can hear the author's defences: Hey, it's nothing new, the Romans had their public spectacles of gladiators fighting to the death: and some ancient cultures had human sacrifices of their young: all I did was put these together. In an interview she even used the term \\"gladiatorial.\\" Sorry: why would you try to yank us back into times of obscene brutality?<br /><br />I am truly sorry to see that this book - don't know the other two - has received such widespread acclaim. Disturbing. And the movie is rated PG-13! WHAT IS WRONG WITH US?

B009HEMW4W|5.0|well kept to original plot lines and a WHOLE HEAP OF PHUN !! whodathunk josh brolin , but he does excellent . usual monsters and wild rigs and gigs . no &#34;little red button&#34; but great jet-packs . even some of the &#34;off the wall&#34; stuff is near believable in this one ..  gotta go now , dog is harassing me.....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What's not to like? Downton Abbey captures all the style and grace of aristocratic England without the stuffiness one might expect from an English period piece. The characters are all unique and their story lines create a patchwork quilt of subplots that continue to draw in the audience as it moves from one story to another.<br /><br />A soap opera? Perhaps, but the most stylish and engaging that I've ever seen. All class and no trash.
