B00003CWOL|1.0|What is there to say about this movie?<BR>The only good actors in it are Alan Rickman, Jason Lee, and George Carlin. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon couldn't act their way out of a paper bag if they had to. They're both the same in every single movie they're in, and they're both extremely annoying.<br />I've always liked Kevin Smith's work, but this movie was simply appaling. That thing at the end with Alanis Morrisette as God.. BAD call Kevin, what the Hell was he thinking? Putting a racist person like Chris Rock in any movie as a character even remotely &quot;righteous&quot; or &quot;holy&quot; is an insult to anyone with a frontal lobe. And all this garbage with Jay... I nearly prayed to the porcelain idol after seeing him again. He's a bad, BAD actor; he's just not funny or creative at all. He makes me look hysterical. Somebody with a comedic side so devoid of talent shouldn't even be cast in a comedy.<br />On a scale of 1-10 I'd give this movie a 3 or so, cause it does have some funny parts in it (not very many, but they're in there).
B00007GZR0|4.0|This is the 3rd and final movie made by Hollywood's famous comedy-duo (Rock Hudson and Doris Day). Rock plays a hypochondriac. He misinterprets a conversation his doctor has and thinks he is a dying man. Hiding his shock-discovery from his wife (Doris Day) he starts his crusade to find her a replacement husband. More misunderstandings result with Doris leaving him as she believes he's hiding an affair. <br />This really is a zany, feel-good film, a total escape from reality featuring the equally cheery title theme song written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David.
B000002G7E|5.0|This album is one of the all-time greats and had a tremendous influence on many who followed.  Yes, there are some self-indulgent moments, but taken as a whole this is a phenomenal record.  Cale is the standout instrumentalist here - his ethereal viola on &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot;, his charging bass on the title cut, and yes, his cheesy Vox organ-distorted-to-hell on &quot;Sister Ray.&quot; Goodness knows why the detractors find it necessary to chime in on this one; maybe they're just passing the time while waiting for the next Celine Dion release.

B000002V07|4.0|In order to truly enjoy this CD, try to appreciate it for what it is, rather than focusing on what it is not.  It is not for fanatical audiophiles who demand sonic perfection from the record producer.  It is not a party record, unless your idea of a wild time is to nod off in an opium den.  Above all, it is not for those who cannot appreciate the creation of a sustained, languid aural mood for the course of a full-length album.<br />This CD is a more gothic version of the landmark &quot;Trinity Session&quot; CD by the Cowboy Junkies; a stylish, languid exploration of the time-honored themes of love, loss, and the fears and apprehensions that connect the two.  The lyrics are vague and amorphous, which can also describe much of the sound, but don't let the comments of some others mislead you:  the tempos of the songs may be similarly slow, but there's significant variation in presentation.  <br />&quot;Fade Into You&quot; &quot;Into Dust&quot;, and &quot;Five String Serenade&quot; depend upon simple, but elegantly performed acoustic guitar hooks, while &quot;Mary of Silence&quot; and &quot;She's My Baby&quot; are more dense and ominous.  &quot;Wasted&quot; stands most apart from the other tracks, with its focus on lazy bursts of discordant electric guitar. <br />The overall result reminds me of Salvadore Dali's portrait comprised primarily of blocks of single color which, if you relax your eyes and look upon from a distance, fuse themselves into a likeness of Abraham Lincoln.  &quot;So Tonight That I Might See&quot; is similar, in that the individual sounds that comprise the album seem unremarkable, as if the effort to make them was uninspired, but taken as a whole they result in a surprisingly cohesive, focused session of mood music.<br />Yes, there's a bit of pretentiousness here, but it seems to be more a result of well-intentioned earnestness than haughty delusions of grandeur.  &quot;So Tonight That I Might See&quot; is by no means a masterpiece, but certainly deserves a place in your CD rack if you like to turn the lights down and let music slow your world down for you.
B00005R2M3|3.0|The music: Latin and spice and everything nice. Well, almost. Although definitely not deep and certainly no nominee for Stunning Lyrics of the Year Album, this disc pleasantly surprised me. Shakira has a throaty, mature voice and uses it to good effect. If she had topics worth singing about she could really be something. As it is, Laundry Service has several good tracks to offer: Objection (her guy is cheating on her and, objection, she's sick of this triangle); Underneath Your Clothes (self explanatory!); Whenever, Wherever (wherever her guy goes, she'll be right there with him); and Rules (the rules she's made for her guy). Every song has the same theme and that does get repetitive, however for variety there are also Spanish versions of Objection and Whenever, Wherever, as well as several other Spanish songs. I can understand only about ten words of Spanish, but I enjoyed listening to them nonetheless.<br />The booklet: Eighteen pages of neatly organized lyrics and a couple of good (if very revealing) black and white photos of Shakira inside and a color photo on each cover.<br />In summary: Like I said, there's nothing deep or different here, but Shakira obviously as a future and she's off to a passable start.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Stone Temple Pilots are the most under valued yet greatest contribitors to rock and roll since 1992.<br />This is an incredible album. In my opinion, Core, Purple, and Tiny Music will be the catalyst for the next generation of rock. Hopefully that will occur soon.<br />The great thing is that STP is still rocking as hard as ever - No.4 and Shangri-La Dee Da are the only real rock albums of recent years. God Bless 'em.<br />STP is the most influential survivor from the music revlution of the early 1990's. Hands Down.
0553208845|5.0|hesse's anti-platonic tale of siddhartha--a contemporary dharma bum of gotama the buddha--is poignant and concise. like myriad thinkers influenced by nietzsche, hesse advocates a return to nature: a re-spiritualization of being. siddhartha seeks truth only through himself. seeking to evince the root of his own existence, he refuses to follow anyone. in the end, he discovers the primary fact of life is flux, and at the core of everything is change.<br />hesse's poetic language is beautiful even in translation, but if you desire a truly hallucinatory vision of subjective reality--of racing thoughts and interpenetrating minds--read anything by virginia woolf. her stream-of-consciousness method captures and expresses the essence of being.
B00005JM1D|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen.  I HIGHLY recommend going to see it!
044022165X|5.0|This is the first Grisham novel I've ever read, and I enjoyed every page.  The Rainmaker is well paced, engaging, witty, and surprisingly resonant.  I could completely relate to Rudy, the main character, and I rejoiced at his triumphs, great and small, and I sympathized even with his petty, less noble moments.  He's just a regular guy trying to make his way in the world and do some good while he's at it, and it was fun partaking in his journey.<br />Grisham has a great sense of humor, and I still find myself smiling over the title &quot;paralawyer&quot; and the preppy Waspishness of &quot;Trent and Brent&quot;.  The line, &quot;Go chase an ambulance,&quot; is both cruel and hilarious, yet once you get to know Deck, you understand that he doesn't even have enough shame to be offended by such jabs.  <br />I laughed aloud during the jury selection passage, and I found myself cringing during Rudy's confrontation with Cliff, aka &quot;Fists of Fury, Redneck Style&quot;.  I chewed my lips constantly in suspense through the last third of this book, and I was loath to put it down.  Let's just say that I was definitely drawn into the story.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone since the characters are realistic, the writing style is sparse and elegant, and there are little realisms and moments of truth that catch you off guard in their simplicity.  This book contains grief and tragedy, but never once does Grisham cheapen his characters by resorting to maudlin, pity-party tactics.  <br />I will now be on the lookout for another Grisham novel that's as engaging as this one.  If you buy this book, you're not likely to be disappointed.
630218021X|1.0|The movie it self is not that bad, but the person they portrait is not P.I Tchaikovsky.  I've read biographies, diary, and letters of Tchaikovsky, the way the main character behaved in the movie sounded nothing like Pyotr himself. Other than the correct names, almost all other information are false.  If you want to see a movie of a person who's almost mentally insane, this is probably the movie for you, but if you want to know who is Pyotr Tchaikovsky, look no further than his own words.
0783230370|3.0|I wasn't disappointed when watching this movie because it was just as I'd hoped it would be, cute, funny and fun to watch over and over.  When I need a pick-me-up, this movie puts a smile on my face every time.

He is the THILLER.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I watched this movie recently at the IMAX screen on Navy Pier. And this is Disney's 2nd animated that hasn't been in stock in years to get re-released. The other was Beauty and the Beast. And looks like next year, Aladdin will come to IMAX and other giant screen theatres. And this is a good film to see on IMAX and other giant screen theatres, if you want to watch The Lion King, whether or not you currently own the Lion King on video tape. As the movie opens, Simba is born to Mufase (James Earl Jones) and Sarabi (Madge Sinclair). But Mufase's brother SAcar (Jeremy Irons) was not present when Simba was shown off to all the animals in Priderock. When Simba (Jonthan Taylor Thomas) becomes older, Musfase tells that one day he will be king and he also orders Simba to never go into the shadowly lands. And aginst both of the advice to stay away from the land from both Scar and Mufase. Simba pretends to be going around the water hole and asks his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) to go with him. They get permission from thier mothers but Zazu (Rowan Atkinson) has to make the trip with them. They ditch Zazu and goes off to the Shadowly Lands.
B000000993|5.0|I've just left my &quot;nu-metal&quot; phrase, cos i've only been listening to metal for 2 years. Now, i have 2 people screaming into my ears, &quot;Listen to more hardcore bands&quot; and &quot;Listen to more progressive, experimental bands&quot;. I needed a medium. Then, I heard Aenima by Tool (single). I was shocked that i liked it so much, since I'd only heard Schism before now and i didn't take to kind likely to it (Don't hit me, I was in my &quot;nu-metal&quot; stage). I started thinking &quot;Tool are hard enough and are progressive in the own right&quot; Perfect.<br />Soon, i was standing in HMV, looking at the metal section i came across Undertow by Tool. &quot;hmmm&quot; i thought. &quot;I haven't heard anything off this ablum, but the other stuff i've heard is pretty good, it's a bit of a gamble buying this&quot;. My £15 was burning a hole in my pocket, I needed some new stuff to listen to, so i did it... I returned home and immediatly put the CD in my player and pressed play.<br />This album is great. I listened and listened hard and i loved it. My favourite track is probably Undertow itself, probably for the pre chorus where Keenan sings quietly &quot; I'm so comfortable, too comfortable&quot;. I just do not know what to say. Go buy it. Don't take my word for it, or anyone elses. Tool are a band that you and you alone should listen to and make you're own opinion.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This was the 2nd Slayer album that I purchased.  The one that got me into Slayer was Divine Intervention back in late 1997.  When I heard that album I immediately wanted more from this band so I checked various sites for some reviews of the good Slayer albums and everyone picked Reign in Blood to be their absolute best.  Ok, I decided I was game and laid down the [bucks]to purchase this album.  <br />What I got was something that was totally unlike anything on Divine Intervention with the exception of the blazing speed of Dittohead.  Reign in Blood was like one 30 minute song sprawled out over 10 tracks.  The songs flowed together perfectly and the middle 8 thrash numbers perfectly fit between the book ended songs Angel of Death and Raining Blood.  Every song on this CD has a memorable riff and some great solos.  One thing that really set Slayer aside from the other similar bands of the era was their vocals.  For a band as extreme as Slayer was in the mid to early 90s they always had vocals that were accessable.  That's not to say I don't like the death vocals as I've become quite a fan of the Death and Black Metal genres in the years since getting Reign in Blood, but I must say that Reign in Blood is the cd that persuaded me to dig deeper into extreme metal.  <br />It would be an understatement to say that this is the cd that most perfectly walks the line between brutality and enjoyability.  There is just enough melody and periods of slow down throughout the album that allows the listener to get into a groove before being hammered by the next speedy track.  The slow down periods are certainly not filler either, as the grinding sections on Angel of Death, Jesus Saves, Criminally Insane, and Postmortem are some of the greatest parts of the album.  <br />As I'm sure you can tell by reading this review that it's hard to classify this album.  What it is not hard to do is classify the greatness of this album.  Go get it now if you don't already have it, though every selfrespecting metal head already owns it.
B000002BPS|5.0|The Offspring is one of my favorite bands. After listening to this CD, they will be one of your favorite bands too. This is better than Americana or Conspiracy. If you heard their recent song \\"Defy You\\" (Orange County soundtrack), the songs on Ixnay are that good, if not better. You might occasionally hear \\"All I Want\\" or \\"Gone Away\\" on the radio (if you have an alt-rock radio station). However there is so much good music on this album that you won't hear unless you get the CD. The only drawback is there is only about 35 minutes of music. But it is all good music. If you didn't know, the Offspring is a staunch advocate of file-sharing. So go ahead and sample a few of their tracks. I recommend \\"Leave It Behind\\" (track 6), \\"Way Down the Line\\" (track 11), and \\"Amazed\\" (track 13). I guarantee you will want to get the album after listening to these tracks. The artwork in the booklet is also really cool. It's almost worth buying the CD just for that. The bottom line - Get this CD. It is worth paying full price for (I didn't)...
B000006OBQ|4.0|I agree with a previous poster in that Sinatra's studio work is best.  But, if you are planning on buying one, and only one Frank Sinatra live album, Sinatra & Sextet: Live in Paris is a much better album.  I should know, I own both 'Paris' and 'Sands'.  Paris is much tighter musically and Frank gives a better performance.  I am not saying Sands is bad, and if you have a need for a live Sinatra performance backed up by a big band, then by all means get the Sands.  But Live in Paris to me, is a better buy.
0060278269|5.0|Abhorsen was one of the best books that I have ever read. It was full of mystery, intrigue, adventure,and strong emotions. ... <BR>The plot revolves around Lirael and her nephew Prince Sammeth. They, along with mogget and the Disreputable dog, are on a quest to stop the destroyer before he completely anhilates the world. In the end, it seems that the only way to stop this is with the Seven, and at the price of Lirael's life. Abhorsen is a wonderfully fantastic book (full of dark magic) that is hard to put down. I reccomend reading Sabriel and Lirael first.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|It just goes to show that an old movie can come out on DVD with lots of extra features (take note, Paramount).  Any fan would agree that getting this movie alone is enough to race out and buy it.  Warner have gone the extra mile though and added a recent documentary on Crawford (and it's over an hour in length!), heaps of Crawford trailers for her other movies and also some snapshots of Awards she received for the film.  The film itself has been restored to pristine condition.  Still, there are some complaints  - when will Warner Bros move away from cardboard DVD cases? It is very annoying because these can get scratched! We want plastic cases, thanks.  The other complaint relates to the cover art.  Warner obviously didn't know their product because they have included a picture of Joan with a gun on the bottom of the cover with words referring that men wouldn't want to know her.  Wrong movie Warner!  I guess they'll fix it up, and for those who have this dud cover - well, it might be worth something in years to come because of this error!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I can't express how beautiful and haunting Ms. Jones' can be. &quot;Don't know why&quot; got me interested but that's far from the best on the album.  &quot;One flight down&quot; evokes a melancholy feeling that's reminiscent of Billie Holliday, and I know that's a bold statement.  This girl has a beautiful future ahead of her, hopefully she gets the great production she got on this work.
0393317552|5.0|A fantastic read for me -- this is a very profound body of work. While at times, I felt I was questioning the scientific &quot;proof&quot; behind the positions, my natural instincts kept telling me that -- even if the proof was not beyond doubt -- the probability was very high that the logic and fact connected. This made a direct impact on my correlation between winning and losing strategies at many levels -- including in the world economic and business conditions today.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This has to be the best CD I have ever heard in my entire life.  I would recommend anyone to buy this album.  The girls are very beautiful and both have wonderful voices.  Since the first time I heard &quot;Ya Shosla S uma&quot;(I have lost my mind), I fell in love with TATU!  I don't think I will ever get tired of listening to them.  I can't wait for them to come out with thier second album!  I LOVE TATU!
B00003CXHJ|4.0|In \\"U-571\\", an untested USN officer named Tyler (Mcaunaghey) leads the green crew of an obsolete USN submarine on a daring, top-sectret mission of modern piracy against a crippled Nazi U-Boat. It's 1942, dark days for the allies everywhere, and especially in the battle of the north Atlantic. Freighters steal across the Atlantic in convoys, desperate to get their needed cargo to Europe to shore up the western front against Germany.  German sailors in U-boats hunt the convoys down in organized wolfpacks.  In a desperate battle for both sides, the Germans lost about 30,000 men, but came close to cutting the Atlantic off.  In the beginning of the flick, allied intelligence picks up the U-571's distress call, the having barely survived a crushing depth charge attack.  Quickly realizing they've got a chance to grab the sub and its sensitive equipment intact, Washington hits upon a plan of modern-day piracy.  They commandeer a tired \\"S-Boat\\" - an American submarine already obsolete before WWII - to rendezvous with U-571 under the disguise of rescuing German sub. The S-boat's inadequacies are painful, but her small size makes her a convincing stand-in for U-571's sister ship.  Washington cares less about U-571 than its \\"Enigma\\" - an early generation of calculator used by the Kriegsmarine to decode/encode messages to and from its warships. By capturing an Enigma, the allies hope to break the German codes and learn to navigate its ships around the Nazi subs which, stealth aside, are slow and very vulnerable. Fooling the Germans at first, the initial operation comes off flawlessly - and our boys capture both Nazi-sub and enigma in one of those otherwise bloodless operations we've seen in countless war movies. But that's only a set-up for when the plan goes bad: U-571's actual sister-sub appears, torpedoes and all, and U-571 becomes the kind of movie we haven't seen that much of. With their own sub sent to the bottom, Tyler and the rest of his crew must save U-571, learn the secret of driving the foreign sub and sail her across the Atlantic. Tyler is a whiz at subs, but he's unproven. Instead, he relies on Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel) to explain what \\"Sub School\\" could not. After narrowly defeating U-571's sister-sub, Tyler and his crew settle on the slightly less impossible of two plans - sail for England, getting as close as possible without being sighted...by anybody. (Should the Germans learn of U-571's capture, they will certainly modify both Enigmas and their codes, and Tyler's efforts will have been in vain.) Discovery is less likely in an eastward course, even though it means braving waters swimming with U-boats. By the end of the flick, Tyler will have barely survived a game of \\"cat and mouse\\" with a German destroyer, and a near Mutiny with his own crew.<br />This flick took a lot of lumps for realism stretches, though most deserve qualification. The film entirely omits any mention of England's recovery of an Enigma machine in 1941, years before we Yanks. Simply ignoring history is bad, but it doesn't make the story as implausible as \\"U-571\\"'s many British critics would insist.  Given how tight-lipped the British were on any subject connected to their ability to read German codes, it's entirely possible that too few American planners in '42 would have known enough about England's possession of Enigma to declare Tyler's mission unnecessary (England declined to declassify their work on Enigma after the war's end, keeping the wraps on until the early 1970's). A cursory mention of England's seizure of Enigma does not otherwise correct the historical flaws of the film (the story is still inexplicably bereft of any British characters, and it would have taken little to actually add some to the script).  On the flip side, a painfully accurate story obviates a more stinging barb on the Brits - one that both acknowledges that they got Enigma first, but also that they kept their exploits silent even knowing that their allies would risk their own men on near suicidal missions to nab what the British already had.  (Can you imagine the howls had \\"U-571\\" ended with our heroes turning over their hard-won prize to the RN...only for it to join hordes of similar machines silently amassed by the allies, blind, deaf and dumb to the sacrifices of Tyler's men?)  The subject of England's stinginess with anything relating to German cryptography, at the cost of American lives, is discussed overtly in Robert Harris's great novel \\"Enigma\\", a novel which Has not been criticized for historical inaccuracy. Further, while critics here think this is another attempt at Hollywood revisionism, it's easy to point out that Hollywood holds no monopoly in that area, as anybody who's ever seen \\"Breaking the Sound Barrier\\" can attest - in which we learn that the first man to fly faster than sound was actually a British Pilot flying a DeHavilland fighter.  While \\"Breaking\\" boldly claimed for England credit for the first manned supersonic flight, 'U-571' at least had the decency to set its story a year after the Brits Enigma recovery.  <br />Taking an unrealistic premise - Tyler and his crew assimilating the incredibly complicated and undeniably foreign ship - \\"U-571\\" works in a very realistic way, with the script showing how quick thinking and not a small amount of luck saved the day, and how narrowly Tyler and crew beat the odds. The cinematography goes even further, letting us know that, contrary to what we've seen in \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" and \\"Destination Tokyo\\", Submarines were cramped and dark, leaked water, were very slow, groaned under the pressure of the water above and, when surfaced, dipped and climbed on waves like a tin can. This is probably the only flick since \\"Das Boot\\" to convey just how impossible a job it was to fight in subs in WWII. It's no \\"Das Boot\\", but \\"U-571\\" now makes it impossible to watch any of those quaint and propaganda-laden movies made during the war.
0440237688|4.0|Lois Lowry's tale of a future without choice, without pain, and without love is a cautionary tale for every generation. The main character, Jonas, learns the value of emotion, growth and choice through memories of the past, highlighting the oft-repeated quote, a favorite among social studies teacher, \\"Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.\\" Though few of the characters develop into anything more than examples of how a wrold without a past can go terribly awry, the world Lowry creates is a fascinating, frightening example of how choice and freedom are invaluable resources.
B000002LIX|5.0|first off, I'll say that I find Ritual to be a more musically interesting and challenging album than Nothing's Shocking.  the band takes more risks and tries to accomplish more, and it's a breathtaking, mind-boggling achievement for a group of musicians.  that being said, I prefer Nothing's Shocking because I find that one to be a more powerful and affecting album.  but they're both works of genius, and belong in the collection of any serious fan of music.  note that I said music, not rock or alternative or punk.  because the two albums are significant and masterful enough that they can't be limited to a genre.<br />now, then.  there's been a lot of talk in these reviews about Three Days and Then She Did, and I feel compelled to share some knowledge with my fellow Amazon customers.<br />Three Days is not just a song about a heroin-fueled weekend with two girls.  it's a memorial of sorts to a girl that Perry loved, a girl who was a budding artist, who ODed before achieving her promise.  yes, some of the lyrics are about one lost weekend, but it also commemorates everything about his lost friend (\\"we miss you, my dear Xiola...\\").  this theme was carried forth into Then She Did (the original title was Then She Died) and Perry addresses his dead friend in the last stanza, asking her to say hello to his own dead mother when she gets to heaven: \\"will you say hello to my ma, will you pay a visit to her, she was an artist just as you were, I'd have introduced you to her...\\"<br />that's pretty powerful stuff.  this album was clearly not intended to please rock critics and semi-literate music dilettantes with short attention spans.  the two songs I've discussed are songs with a purpose, a message to convey, and emotions to share with the world.  and they are epic works of musicianship.  Three Days is like four distinct songs weaved together into one amazing masterpiece.  it always carries enough power to justify its length, and it never gets dull.<br />none of what I've saidhere is intended to convert people who don't like the songs.  nor should it affect your opinion.  I do believe a song should stand on its own merits without a five-minute explanation.  the songs clearly stand on their own and have power and meaning, without justification.  but maybe, for the people who already love the songs, love the album, and actually get what the band was trying to do, these bits of information will add to your appreciation of the work and show you some more of the depths of their achievement.
0385495323|5.0|To be brief, Mr. Singh's &quot;The Code Book&quot; is an excellent read.<br />Although the story, tracing the developement of cryptology and cryptanalysis through history, is in itself very interesting, what impressed me the most was the author's style of writing and manner in presenting the subject at hand. His delivery is easy-going yet detailed, weaving a story that is not only, dare I say, educational, but also simply &quot;hard to put down.&quot; This is indeed a book for anyone who enjoys reading, regardless of alterior interests.
0446672653|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a nice, clear overview of the past-life regression theory and practice.  I enjoyed the quotes from very notable historical figures at the beginning of each chapter (they lent even more credibility to the subject).  I particularly appreciated the &quot;revelations&quot; from the Masters that are sprinkled throughout the story.  I even enjoyed the author's opinions on psychic abilities and other delicate subjects.  If it wasn't a library book, I would have highlighted several important passages.<br />I would not say I'm totally convinced that the characters actually lived and remembered past lives.  The book was sort of fluffy and ethereal as are most books on spiritual/New Age material (they are very hard to translate into day to day reality).  But definately something to ponder.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|I only purchased Beth Gibbons \\"Out of Season\\" today and I had to write to let others know about this most gorgous album.  When I got home this evening I was really looking forward to sitting down and listening to this.  Being that I am a Portishead fan I sort of had my expectations.  I was worried this would be Portishead lite or so \\"unplugged\\" it would be boring.  Was I ever pleasently surprised.  After listening I had to jump up and write and here I am listening again for the third time tonight.  This album is so familiar, comforting and soft and yet somthing completly new.  Beth is able to change her voice almost completly with each song.  She's often been compared to Billie Holiday, but here she is evoking Dusty Springfield, Nina Simone, Sandy Denny and even the sounds of Mowtown on \\"Tom the Model\\".   \\"Mysteries\\" is an enchanting lullaby that sucks you in.  \\"Show\\" has a kind of cracked Marianne Faithfull quality that is (pun unavoidable) show stopping.  \\"Funny Time Of Year\\" reminds me of \\"The Windmills Of Your Mind\\" by Dusty in the way that it slowly builds and becomes more and more intense with each verse.  This is a quite sort of nighttime album, soft, sexy and full of heart.  If you enjoy great singers with the ability to create moods and able to engage the listener then you'll love this album.  Enjoy.
B00007KQA3|3.0|Well its finally on DVD! Let me start with the good.<BR>The new anamorphic widescreen transfer is very very nice looking. A direct comparison to the full screen VHS shows much more width and slightly less height in this new transfer. Detail, sharpness and color are all miles better than any other home video edition. Now the bad, when comparing the VHS and DVD I noticed something very disturbing. There are certain scenes where portions of the score are completely missing. Early in the film during the scene where John Hurt is removing a book from behind a brick in the wall there is absolutely no score that was present in the original VHS. This occurs again during the flash back to the dirty old lady that he has sex with and again when he has sex with the girl in the forest. It happens many more times throughout the film, so I will not list all the instances here. These scenes are clearly weakened by the missing music and its too bad they couldn't have done it right.
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is unquestionably my favorite album/CD of Bowie! (BOWIE AT THE BEEB is close but that's because many of the songs from this are on that). Yeah, there are great songs scattered throughout his long and interesting career, but this is the one that shows his talent the clearest. Starting with the lovely \\"Soul Love\\" and moving into the hard-rocking, superb \\"Moonage Daydream\\" (one of the greatest rock songs) and into the wonderful \\"Starman.\\" Super music! There are over fine songs such as \\"Lady Stardust\\" and \\"Hang on to Yourself\\" that stand up in quality to other great Bowie songs. \\"Rock and Roll Suicide\\" is a strong closer, giving the listened no doubt this that David Bowie was meant to be a STAR! I haven't heard the bonus tracks but know the CD is worth having for the original somgs.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Well, if you thought Fellowship of the Ring was good, The Two Towers steps up to the plate and works just beautifully as the sequel. <br />Of course, the main elements are the battle at Helm's Deep, the return of Gandalf (now the White), entirely CGI Gollum, and ditto CGI with Treebeard.<br />It's just an absolutely cool movie! It doesn't need a bunch of sex and bad words to make it worth going to either. The only problem people might have with it is violence, which can be intense for youngsters, and even adults.<br />Still, I loved the movie. It works excellently with Tolkien's second book in the trilogy, though there ARE some bones to pick with it: some things are definitely changed, the biggest one taking place in Faramir, who in the books is a stout, brave-hearted nobleman who refuses to give in to the temptation of the Ring. In the movie, it's quite different.<br />Otherwise, it's really great, you should see it!
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you only own one CD, it should be this one!  These songs are the best! You can listen to them to calm you down, make you go to sleep, to relax or just to listen to.  I am sooo happy that Norah won all of her five Grammy's!  She deserves it!!!
B00005JLRR|5.0|I was extreemly happy with this film.  Yes, the first<BR>few minutes were a little dopey (wedding scenes) but the<BR>rest of the movie went on really well and the last half<BR>hour of the movie was the best I'd ever seen in any Trek<BR>film....
0792839625|2.0|If you genuinely enjoyed the original show and the real meaning behind the story, do NOT buy or rent this movie.<br />The choreography was decent at times, and of course the score is great, but the meaning of what I consider the centerpiece number of the show, &quot;What I Did for Love&quot;, is totally changed to a love song. This is NOT meant to be a &quot;love song&quot; in the traditional sense, but a song about the love of theatre and dance. And the romance between Cassie and Zach is not suppose to be the focal point of the show.<br />They would have been far better off to have simply video taped the show on stage!
0060090367|1.0|After reading &quot;Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married,&quot; which I found mildly entertaining, I thought it might be worhtwhile to pick up another of Keyes's novels.  I regret the impulse.  We are introduced to Claire as she, almost simultaneously, gives birth to a daughter and is abandoned by her husband.  Not to worry, though -- in less than two months she's back in her pre-pregnancy clothes and back in the sack with a new man.  The baby seems incidental; every so often Claire remembers that she's a mother and acts accordingly -- for about two pages.<br />In attempting to create a delightfully fey, girlish character, in fact, Keyes has given us a raving narcissist.  Grindingly repetitive interior monologues stand in for character and story development.  It's a shame, because Keyes is not a bad writer on the whole, and she shows occasional flashes of real wit.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones has a unique and fascinating plot that shows how a fourteen-year-old girl named Susie Salmon watches from heaven how her family and friends deal with her murder.  <BR>She has to slowly but surely accept that she is dead, and her family and friends hurtle through trials and tribulations in coming to this extreme realization.  But, they all come together in spirit and emotion with a touching and very climactic ending.  <BR>Through out the entire book, I was gasping for more.  Never have I read any fiction that was so real and vividly potrayed. <BR>If you love deep, suspenseful, poetic fiction, you will love The Lovely Bones.
B000068TPN|5.0|In the Civil War when soldiers were asked by civilians what the combat was like they said that describing it was like describing an elephant to a blind man.  With the movie, \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" one has the sense that you have been give a glimpse of the elephant.<BR>The movie is perfect in many ways.  It is perfect in showing loyalty of soldiers to their homeland and the loyalty of brothers-in-arms.  It is perfect in its horror in that it relays the terror, pace and numbness of combat.  It is also perfect in its showing of the impact of combat on the soldiers of both sides and their families at home.<BR>\\"We Were Soldiers\\" stands in the good company of other films that, in their age and in their way have tried to show us, in the comfort of our homes, the experience of war.  I feel that it ranks with \\"BattleGround,\\" \\"Private Ryan\\" and \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" as a great presentation of the experience of war on people.
0375728007|5.0|The film A Walk To Remember was recommended to me by a friend who said it was wonderful. I didnt think that she was truthful but decided to watch it anyway. It was a masterpiece, incredibly moving and made me cry. I enjoyed it so much i decided to buy the book. The book was even better than the film, so moving and the relationship of the two main characters made me realise that pure love does exist. I recommend this book to everyone! Truely moving and inspirational..it shows pure love at its best!
B000002IGV|2.0|For a long time this album was very embarrassing, but as time has gone by I must admit that songs like \\"We're not gonna take it\\" and \\"I wanna rock\\" sure has something appealing. It's hard to take Twisted Sister serious (just look at the album cover) and I like to think that Dee Snider &amp; Co themselves laughed at the whole thing.  <br />The album is rather uneven in my opinion. The best song is without doubt the title track \\"Stay hungry\\". By the time of the release this was (light) heavy metal and I'm pretty sure that the once who find this album enjoyable are mostly \\"older\\" people who grow up with Twisted Sister among others. Youngsters may say: \\"what the f**k is this?\\"
B000000OMP|5.0|When I first heard \\"Slide it in\\" back in 1984 I was unfamiliar with Whitesnake, but as the opening song \\"Gambler\\" (European release) hit my ears I was hooked! Whitesnake gave me exactly what I had been looking for - great songs with excellent vocals. Many of the bands that were around at the time seemed to be more or less amateurs in comparison to David Coverdale's Whitesnake. The music is melodic and catchy - it's traditional blues based hard rock. \\"Slide it in\\" can be seen as the bridge between the earlier rhythm &amp; blues approach to the later heavy metal direction. As a dedicated Whitesnake fan I think \\"Slide it in\\" is the best album alongside with \\"Ready an' willing\\".<br />Let yourself be blown away by songs like \\"Gambler\\", \\"Guilty of love\\", \\"Love ain't no stranger\\", \\"Standing in the shadow\\"!
B00000DR5I|5.0|The two songs here flow together perfectly.  Clocking in at around 15 minutes each.  This album is a tremendous step forward for this group (or was), and probably will be remembered for a long time to come, also for influencing many musicians of the electronica genre and also others (i.e. Porcupine Tree).<br />Being a fan of this type of music I find a maturing in the music s sound from the beginning records up to this one.  Zeit was definitely the second strongest record made between 1970 and 1975 (this is only my opinion).  And Rubycon goes up to Numero 1.<br />I see no pointless or sub par playing on rubycon.  This band IMHO rarely made an uninspìred record.  That would be a cowardly thing to say (that they did).  Maybe some of the ones they did in the 80 s or 90 s were much different than the Kosmiche musik classics made in the early to mid 70 s, but they remained inspired.  <BR>I believe this band is one of the strongest in its genre that exists or existed.  Please, go buy yourself this record, or I would also recommend Zeit or Alpha centauri to begin your musical experience w this heavyweight of electronica groups that ever made music on this planet.
B00000ING2|4.0|The Coen brothers and Samuel Raimi belong to this wave of young american directors that appeared in the eighties and that replaced the John Huston, Richard Brooks and Arthur Penn's generation which slowly retired at that time. Some of these young wolves, like Michael Bay, were more interested in presenting inept pictures without a single ounce of originality while the Coen brothers and Samuel Raimi's movies, with the years passing by, were becoming more and more worthy of the works of their illustrious elders.<br />In this viewpoint, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY can be watched as an homage to one of the heroes of the Hollywood of the thirties and the forties : Frank Capra. If you're familiar with the movies of the director of NEW-YORK-MIAMI, you'll certainly greatly appreciate THE HUDSUCKER PROXY that presents scenes inspired by such movies as Capra's MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU or MEET JOHN DOE.<br />If you don't remember or, worse, don't know these movies, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY could seem a little strange at times to you. For instance, the scenes with Bill Cobbs's or with the angel lose totally their impact if you haven't seen the Capra movies. I know, it's not fair but cinema is an art that lives on ashes. When the fire was so good, who cares !<br />A DVD zone respect.
6305127689|3.0|The movie is terrific. The sound is spectacular.<BR>But both the non-anamorphic widescreen and fullscreen<BR>pictures were full of defects, which appear to me<BR>to be from the poor quality film print that was used<BR>to make the digital transfer.  Scratches and dust<BR>particles were more than just noticeable; they were<BR>annoying.  I love this movie and have made it part of<BR>my collection, however if you are expecting a DVD that<BR>you can use to show off your new home theater, you should<BR>probably pick another.
B00007BH5C|4.0|Although the first album was simply stunning with the wonderful vocals of Enya and the simplistic flute, this album was a suitable follow on.  If you really want to get the true sense of Howard Shore's masterpiece, listen to both albums back to back and back again.
0448060191|4.0|Little women is a timeless masterpiece in which Louisa May Alcott describes the lives and adventures of four sisters coming of age during the Civil War.  Alcott shows the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with the death of a loved one, family crises, and the mending of broken hearts.  Readers today are still inspired by the lessons taught by Marmee on how to be a good person and how to achieve happiness in life.<BR>  Marmee (Mrs. March) is the mother of the family and the glue that holds them together.  She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature.  Her main goal in life is to be a pleasing wife and secure the happiness of her dauthers.  She diligently teachs them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.<BR>  In reading this novel it gives the reader a glimpse into what its like for women growing up in the 1800's.  Readers today remain inspired by Meg's devotion to her family, Jo's commitment to her writing, and Beth's willingness to help the ones she loves.  Meg is the oldest sister.  She is plump and beautiful with a sweet temper and very motherly.  She appears to be somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she is reduced to living.  She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends.  She fights a constant battle with her feelings even into married life but comes to the realization that she will be content with what she has rather than spend her life wishing for a wealth she will never achieve.  Jo is the next oldest and the main herione.  She is very much the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper.  She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her.  Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal.  Jo's personality is real and evokes sympathy from the reader in her attempts of trying to fit into a society that she doesn't relate to and falls short of those expectations.  Jo's quick temper proves to be a constant battle for her but she diligently battles her demons while being consumed with self doubt.  She works very hard to be a good and pleasing child to her parents.  I feel her character most resembles the author's life.  Alcott goes to great lengths to paint a picture of Jo's character giving great detail and attention to explaining her because she most likely understands her the best.  She is very self sacrificing and has a strong maternal instinct to her younger sister, Beth.  After the death of her sister Jo tries to become her sister in an attempt to hold on to her.  This was her way of keeping Beth close to her but she soon realizes that given her rebel nature it will not work.  Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest.  Throughout the first half of the book I wanted her to blossom and mature to become a personality that would equal her sisters.  This never happened as she always seemed to be content with her state of life and wrapped herself up in her cats and dolls while tending to the minute details of the house trying to make it as happy as possible.  If this was her allotment in life she achieved it very well.  I thought of her as a little angel.  Amy is the youngest, being quite selfish and spoiled.  Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas.  Amy is, however, to be admired for her persistence in dealing with the elite society and striving to rise out of her poverty stricken life which she accomplishes by marrying Laurie, the rich boy next door.  But instead of just enjoying her wealth the couple decides to use that wealth to help the less fortunate.<BR>  Little Women serves as a reminder of just how fragile life and feelings can be.  Alcott breathes life and existence into the charactersthat makes them come to life on the pages before you.  The reader feels as if they are a part of the family.  I had feelings of joy when they succeeded and sorrow when they didn't.  When Beth was very sick I could sympathize with Jo and I also wanted deperately for her to recover.<BR>  Alcott does not profess openly any political or religious beliefs but the story has undertones of the beginning of the women's rights movement and it suppports religious beliefs of the Quakers while promoting the ideals of married life.  Quakers in those days believed that divine relation was immediate and individual;  all persons may perceive the word of God in their soul.  It recognizes the presence of human evil and works to eradicate as much as possible.  The girls definitely followed these beliefs.  When Meg was having marital problems after her twins were born it was Marmee that told her, \\"A woman's happiest kingdom is her home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother.\\"  In the end Jo inherits the estate of her rich aunt.  Prior to this time in history women were not allowed ownership of property and centainly not the right to vote.  A woman was discourged from concerning themselves about politics.  But Marmee gently suggests to Meg this may be a way for her and her husband to reconnect.  This would also explain why the book is more self-centered on the characters than the realities of the era which are not brought into focus.  <BR>  I would not read the book again but I did feel it was worth reading the first time and I am glad I did.  I would very much recommend it to anyone searching for a book that you could relate to the characters and can't help care about them
0066620996|5.0|This book gives the reader anecdotal information on how some companies have gone from being good (meaning just OK) to becoming great (meaning highly successful). In business, that comes down to making a lot of profit, which, fair enough, is the name of the game. Nevertheless, I think American companies should never cease to also remain &quot;Good&quot;, meaning having morals, ethics, and character, because, if Americans and America and American companies cease to be &quot;Good&quot;, they will surely cease to be great. We have seen that today in corporate America with all the scandals. After reading Jim Collins' wonderful practical book, &quot;Good To Great&quot;, anyone really interested in this subject (the morals, ethics, and character part) should go on to read Norman Thomas Remick's easy-to-understand book, &quot;West Point: Character Leadership...&quot;, to grasp the meaning of the little understood philosophical underpinnings of what morals, ethics, and character really are. Then you will understand how important it is to Americans and America and American corporations to aim to be great, but never cease to be &quot;Good&quot;.
B000002HMH|1.0|Just a horrible album if you like the old material. It is a rock album and does not even come close to a metal album. If you want to hear real metal, hear SLAYER!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Puff, then play Red Faction II's Dictator (or deathmatch if you haven't unlocked dictator) while enjoying Amnesiac on a great system with intense stereo.  By the third song you've entered a new state of consciousness and can fold space like the guys in Dune.  This album turned me into a Radiohead fanatic.  Excellent mix of lush computer craziness, soothing moog like synth, complex piano, highly intelligent guitar, and seizure inducing percussion.  The lyrics pull you into a world where even the angles can get black eyes, and acceptance of reality opens the doors to new realities.  Crazy good stuff!!!
B00005JLZL|3.0|The Life of David Gale starts off a little slow, but eventually works up to a surprising conclusion.  This movie was pretty good. The performances by Laura Linney and Kate Winslet were top notch. I think this movie could have been improved a little, but all around, Alan Parker did a good job with what he had.  The first few twists in the movie are very predictable, but, the last one threw me. This movie is definitely not for anyone under 16. There is one strong scene of sexuality, and there are very disturbing images of a killing. All around, the Life of David Gale is worth watching.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I love the album. That's all I feel like saying.
B00006M183|5.0|Well I know that I will love an alblum as soon as I hate it, make sense? Maybe not but, when i first heard Riot Act i was dissapointed, of course the first time I heard Vitalogy I was too, but now I love Vitalogy, I know that when I first really dispise an alblum, like Riot Act, I will end up loving it and I was right. The song I am stuck on right now is &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;, I got front row seats to their concert in Lexington, KY so I am very excited, any way I recommend this disc to any avid PJ fan, and if your new to Pearl Jam start with Vitalogy anf VS
B000002BFZ|5.0|Every time i talk to some one about pearl jam, i can no longer give just a few favorite songs. this song is full of great songs.<BR>i'll be listening to it and say &quot;i wanna hear this song right now, so i think ill skip the next&quot; but it never happens. this CD has great songs after another. <BR>heres a breakdown:<BR>1)Sometimes-Great mellow song, which is an unusual opener for pearl jam. it never gets loud at all, and is just very relaxing. there is no chorus, just verses. Thought-provoking, too<br />2)Hail,Hail-It starts off loud, which is a big suprise after sometimes. It has a really catchy melody and chorus. Its a good 'rockin' song and makes you want to jump a little<BR>3)Who You Are-This song is in a sense very spiritual, since it has a strong message. The clapping in the background and the layered singing makes you (or maybe im just wierd) happy or in a good mood in one way or another<BR>4)In My Tree-I like this song, but not as much as the others. It really shows Eddie's singing capabilities since he starts of soft and deep, then gets loud and pitched. Great percussion on this one<BR>5)Smile-Great upbeat song to get the day started. It makes me in a way a tad upset because of the upsetting chorus. There is nothing like jeremy in it, but the lyrics he sings and the way he sings it makes me get a little upset, since i can relate in a way<BR>6)Off He Goes-WOAH. GREAT SONG! It is a long song, which is very uncommon for PJ. It has a great melody and great lyrics, and seems to be eddie telling a story about a long-lost friend. Great music and again, great percussion<BR>7)Habit-Again, an upbeat song but not exactly positive. Eddie sings about being upset with someone for doing something, or at least thats what i hear<BR>8)Red Mosquito-It has a great flow with the music and eddies singing is sped-up a little bit. its just a great tune<br />The following songs, i think made the CD pushing a little almost to a 4<br />9)Lukin-Short song, but good. Makes you want to scream the lyrics, if you know what hes saying.<BR>10)Present Tense-This song is very mellow and relaxing, thats about it. good lyrics, but thats about it<BR>11)Mankind-Honestly not that good of a song. Its  ok, but nothing special<br />here we go again with the good reviews<br />12)I'm Open-Good song, great lyrics, very relaxing and mellow. Yet again, GREAT PERCUSSION ON THIS ONE!<BR>13)Around the Bend-Great song. Relaxing and a great closer. The CD starts this way, gets a little rockin', then closes slowly<br />I cant pick a favorie from this CD. number 1,2,3,6,7 and 8 all tie...
0316666343|4.0|This is really an extraordinary, beautifully written book that finds something life affirming in the greatest of tragedies. Its characters are fascinating, and the writing is compelling. Since reading it, I have been on a quest to read more good stories about life and death, what we can learn about life from the dying, etc...and I thought reading real life accounts would be a good way to get into that. Tuesdays With Morrie is great and so is a brand new book entitled It's All Good: Emails From A Dying Best Friend by Jonathan Widran (Xlibris). It's about an extraordinary friendship and centers around the often humorous, always life affirming emails the two exchanged in the months before one of them died. Takes you through the process in a gripping way, poetically, and shows the value of faith in the process, and what we learn by just being there for others. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed Alice's book!

B00006RU5B|5.0|This cd in great.  The chemistry between Chris Cornell and the former members of Rage Against the Machine is intense.  This group is definitely the greatest new band.  If you liked Soundgarden and Rage, then you will absolutely love this group.  <br />Don't miss out on the experience.   A+++++++++++++++++++
B00008HCCF|4.0|A fun, sweet Norah Jones performance coupled with out-of-this-world audio quality makes this modestly priced DVD a must buy.  You get to hear most of the songs from Norah's \\"Come Away With Me\\" CD, plus a couple of other good pieces.  Extras include the \\"Come Away With Me\\" music video and an encore song from the main concert this DVD chronicled.  Actually it would have been better if the main concert just flowed right into the encore, as I'm sure it did in real life.  Here, Norah says good night, the credits roll, the picture fades to black, and we're sent back to the main menu.  Then, when you click on the \\"encore\\" icon in the extras section, we're right back in New Orleans with Norah back on stage performing \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" (a great rendition, by the way).  Yes, it's a small point, but that extra clicking around was needless and broke the flow of the performance a bit.  Also, some of the lighting was harsh (Norah has what looks like a blue electrical sheen on her face all through one song, which was kind of annoying), and with an excessive amount of fading from one shot to another, the direction drew attention to itself and came off as distracting. But in the end all these things qualify as quibbles, as the musical performance itself- aided by the DVD's excellent sound- is subtle, nuanced, sensual, and very sweet.  Norah is the real deal, a fact that comes through clearly on this DVD.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I will admit that at first glance, i didn't think this band would be able to work together. Two years ago, my brother told me that Chris Cornell was going to replace Zack De La Rocha. I didn't believe him because Cornell never wrote songs about politics and what not. When I got Audioslave, Tom Morello proved to me that he is THE BEST GUITAR PLAYER IN THE WORLD AS OF NOW! He also proved that it doesn't matter who's singing. People are getting sick and tired of these new bands ... I'm finally glad to see ORIGINAL artists do their thing and blow the untalented competition away.
B000002UAC|3.0|Production improves with this album. Either The Beatles improved their playing and singing, or George Martin learned some recording tricks. It's probably both.<br />We return to the same enthusiastic, bubbly pop/rock of the previous album, but more precise and disciplined. Because of that, it lacks the raw energy of PPM, but more than makes up for it by the improved production standards and instrumentation. You can't help but smile while listening to this album.
B000000WF0|5.0|In a day when there is such trite and meaningless music parading through the radio and on television, it is like a refreshing burst of air to hear this album.  I will admit, I bought this only after hearing \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" on the Cruel Intentions Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, but was pleasantly shocked at how brilliant the rest of the album was.  Without a doubt, \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" is one of the most original and inspired recordings in recent years.  However, for all its appeal, I'm not sure its even the best song on this album.  Every human emotion is displayed with incredible accuracy.  On top of the sheer beauty of all the songs, the engineering of this album is neer flawless.  The intricacies in which the technicians layered the guitars and organs should make this required listening for all those in the recording industry.  I find it truly to the world's misfortune that this band amiably disbanded after this album.  Or, perhaps more appropriately, it is a Bittersweet Symphony.
B000002UAF|5.0|Certainly a contender for the greatest pop album of all time. The Beatles explode with this one. Lennon and McCartney craft some of the greatest songs under three minutes here, Harrison shows why he's a great guitarist (he plays exactly what each song calls for - no more, no less. It's nearly impossible to find a musician of his humility) and Ringo's energy and warmth drives the entire album.<br />If you find it too easy to dismiss this band because of their preceived &quot;pop&quot; value, thinking they're only worth the screaming, ovulating female fans that worshiped them: Don't. These are great musicians with great music.
B00005JLO2|5.0|The Four Feathers is the movie you have been waiting for!  There have not been any good movies out on DVD lately and I was really getting bored. The Four Feathers is an epic film of a man's struggle with his courage. Heath Ledger gives an awesome performance. I can't believe he wasn't nominated for a Golden Globe or Oscar. This film also boasts great performances by Wes Bentley and Kate Hudson. This is an awesome movie and I most certainly recommend it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The very first time I heard Norah Jones on the radio singing &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; I knew I had to buy this album.  I knew she was going to be a star and that she will outlast all of the hiphop singers who come and go like the wind.  Norah is in a class all by herself.  That is why she won eight Grammy awards this past week.  Anyone who knows good music can feel a thrill when hearing a voice that is as fresh and unique as Norah Jones' voice is.  I love all kinds of music, especially rock 'n roll, but there are times when I need to luxuriate in Norah Jones' voice and piano.  What a marvelous gift to the world it is to have someone like Norah come along during these fearful and stressful times with her warm, comforting, easy sounding masterpiece of a CD!

B000002JSN|5.0|In my mind this is the definitive Zepp album, bar none. Don't get me wrong, everything up to this record was great but Graffitti was to me the pinnacle of their career! The sonic production (by Page again, of course) was so heavy yet it sounded years ahead of it's time. Plant's wails were spine tingling, especially on \\"In my time of dying\\", what a incredible piece of molten blues(the best tune on the record). Highlights include \\"The Rover\\", the eerie \\"In the light\\", the bombastic  \\"Wanton song\\", the trippy \\"Bron-yr-aur\\", the straight ahead rock of \\"Sick again\\" and one of the most underrated Zepp tunes \\"Ten years gone\\"(what a powerful song). The first time I played this record I knew this was it, the power and the fury all rolled up into this double record. I would give this 6 stars if I could. One of the heaviest pure rock albums ever, mind blowing!! An absolute must have! I just can't find enough words to praise this masterpiece! Hail to Page, Plant, Bonham and Jones from one of the Zepp's biggest fans. Enjoy!!..

0800132335|5.0|i understand that plymouth england wanted to have a german ww2 veteran at their ceremonies for the 50 anniversary of the end of the war. so they asked the german government for names of u boat survivors who might be invited, u boat as they where so deadly on the coastal economy and people. german said they couldnt find any. i understand it was a death sentence to be a u boat crew man during the world. now these maybe urban myths but there is i am sure a core element of truth. the u boats were dangerous and deadly.<br />first, watch the german with subtitles.<br />second, think german. it will help with the transition that will occur to you during the movie. like american indians rooting for the calvary coming to the rescue, you too will be hopeing against hope that YOUR heroes the germans make it back.<br />now it seems part of the logic of propaganda to paint your enemy in the worse possible terms, never yielding a inch to his humanity. this is the only way we can justify the horrors of dresden, tokyo, and 2 atomic bombs. but our enemies in all wars, even the great war to ...... (democracy, against facism, you supply this generations great war title), our enemies are human, they are just like us.<br />that is the great power of this movie, you leave realizing that the germans are people. even heroic in their struggles just to stay alive and to get back home. this is simply one of the best war movies i've ever seen, and it desires rewatching and rethinking, every time you hear of another war on the horizon, and how we are right, and the enemy, whoever it is this time, is subhuman and deserving of the death we will deal out to them...<br />when you hear those drums on the horizon, pop in your copy of das boot and rewatch it, maybe that way this movie will tone down the volume of the approaching hoofbeats(the horseman of the apocalyse).<br />richard williams
B00005JLXC|2.0|What's interesting about many Hollywood films today is that while the technical competence may be there, they often lack those little details that can make film-going such a rewarding experience. That's what makes \\"Daredevil\\" so unusual; it's exactly the opposite. Both the filmmaking and storytelling here are at times stupefyingly sloppy, and yet every once in a while there will be a small moment that really and truly works. For those of you who haven't yet seen it, here's the breakdown:<br />THE PLOT: Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a blind attorney by day, but by night he avenges evil in the seedy Hell's Kitchen district as \\"Daredevil\\", a violent, red-suited version of a guardian angel. Murdock battles the elusive Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan) and his henchman Bullseye (Colin Farell) while romancing Elektra (Jennifer Garner), a greek beauty who just happens to blame Daredevil for her father's death.<br />THE GOOD: Poor Bennifer. The dude gets no respect nowadays. He can be proud of his performance here though; he's quite good. Portraying a blind man convincingly can't be easy, but Affleck is always believable even when the script has him doing things distinctly out of the realm of the visually challenged. Jennifer Garner also aquits herself well as his love interest/sparring partner, and Colin Farrell manages to make his Bullseye at once menacing and a wee bit sexy. Some of the special effects are also a cut above, particularly the manner in which Daredevil's ability to \\"see\\" is rendered. Very cool guys.<br />THE BAD: The continuity. Oh man, the continuity. Horrendous. Huge plot holes, many things that flat out do not make sense at all (such as the \\"Crouching Tiger\\"-style floating around from characters who DO NOT HAVE THIS POWER) and character development that ranges from okay (Daredevil) to slight (Elektra) to almost non-existent (their relationship).<br />THE KIND OF ICKY: The violence. It got to be a bit much. This is not a kid's film, that's for sure. People get sliced, diced, snapped, lacerated, dropped from great heights and chopped in two. I realize that many people do not mind this, but this movie should really not have been PG13. Consider yourself warned.<br />As I said at the outset, the only redeeming aspects of \\"Daredevil\\" are the small moments. A scene during a rainy funeral that echoes an earlier moment atop a roof, a section detailing the homelife of Daredevil (can't be easy to get beat up night after night) and a nifty moment involving Bullseye and a broken pane of glass. In the end though, it just wasn't enough for me. I give this movie 2.5 stars, which I decided to round down to 2 instead of up to 3. There's a better movie trapped inside here; I hope the filmmakers get their act together for the sequel.

079213690X|5.0|Seldom does a movie have such immediate political effects. Mel Gibson will certainly be able to walk across Scotland and never have to buy his own pint. (*grin*)<br />a movie that will supply scenes for both your worst nightmares(as when his new bride dies) and your greatest egomaniac daydreams(as when he dies screaming FREEDOM). certainly one of the 100 best films ever made, but even more importantly a crucial addition to scottish nationalism and to the flow of testosterone in theaters everywhere (*grin*). a marvel of photographic wonders, large groups of excited scots ready to tear the brits to pieces, with music to match both elements. simply a not-to-be missed movie. just buy it and watch monthly for a lift emotional and politically.<br />i am curious that only with the death of his new bride can the audience justify the subsequent rebellion. it is astonishing to me that we have so lost the drive for freedom ourselves that in our mythbuilding, for isn't that what movies like this are, we MUST resort to the personal and the emotional to justify violence, war  even a rather righteous war of independence. i think this says far more about modern people than it does about the Scots of this timeframe....<br />richard williams

B000001Y5X|5.0|There's this thing about Marilyn Manson's career as a musician.  It seems that a lot of people love everything Manson did pre-Mechanical Animals, thinking he sold out in 1998--and many people believe that Mechanical Animals and on is his zenith point with superfluous amounts of maturity.  For years, I was one of those people who believed the latter....but not necessarily anymore.  <br />I use to say Portrait of an American Family had poor production value, and that it was less sophisticated musically. The fact is however, that Marilyn Manson hasn't had half as sophisticated bass or guitars on any of his albums since.  Marilyn Manson as a band hasn't embraced the originality and creativity that he did on Portrait.    <br />This doesn't mean I like Portrait above his other albums.  Each album has strong points above other albums, but I no longer consider Portrait as just the \\"starting block\\" for Manson.  Hell no.  It's simply in the league of his other epic of records.    <br />The obvious exception in all of this should be The Golden Age of Grotesque, which isn't really an album.  <br />So I've been hesitant to say and resisting for so long, but Portrait really does deserve the appraisal it receives.
B00005JLXC|2.0|Growing up reading Daredevil, I gave this movie a lot of slack. There are some great moments and when they work they really work. Those of you familiar with the Elektra/Bullseye storyline will not be disappointed. The directors use of radar is very well used and went beyond my expectations. He even manages to convey Matt's acute sense of smell. And the fight are the best so far in a comic hero adaptation. Check out the duel with the motorcycle. Some great tension between Affleck and Farrell.<br />However the script is appallingly bad. Director/screenwriter Johnson is not satisfied establishing certain elements once and treats the audience as if they were 12 by continually beating you over the head with character revelations, plot points, repeated dialouge and gimmicks (yes, we understand that the scar on Bullseye's head is in fact a Bullseye and that he has the same name.) The fight on the playground is coreographed nicely, but is awkwardly placed and campy. Johnson should stick to the direction and instead of Kevin Smith making a cameo, have him write the next one. Wait a minute! Didd'nt the star Ben Affleck win an Oscar for writing? This is a great matinee movie and I am looking forward to the sequel. If at all to see what they improve upon. Good effort that stays true to the look and feel of the comic. Could have been worse.
B000006NPY|1.0|I can't believe that Adore has averaged a four-star rating! I am an avid SP fan, but even I can't endorse this pretentious self-indulgent garbage. I mean, naming an album &quot;Adore!?&quot; Like Billy Corgan is the first song writer to ever pen love songs? And he has to write an entire CD full of them? You'd think he was a sixteen year old highschool sophmore.<br />What a disappointment!
B00006RIO7|4.0|I dare anyone not to tap there foot while listening to this CD. The only track to moderatley lose it's luster in the transistion is &quot;They Both Reached for the Gun&quot; and that's due to the show stopper of a number in the film. The CD does what it's supposed to: captures the feel of the movie and makes you want to see it again. The last two &quot;Bonus&quot; track are good, but they make a hard turn in a different genre so be prepared. That aside, definitely worth buying.
B0000026KQ|5.0|Jeff Beck only came out with three albums in the 80's, and Guitar Shop is best one, and has since become a Jeff Beck classic. There's a reason for that... it is one of his best albums. The album kicks off with Jeff showing he can play any and every style in the album's title track, and ends with Jeff showing he can still play bad-attitude guitar better than anyone else with \\"Sling Shot.\\" In, the middle, however, are the real jems. \\"Behind the Veil,\\" a Tony Hymas piece, is incredibly funky and reggae-like. \\"Big Block,\\" like Roy's Toy of Jeff's newest album You Had It Coming, shows his love of cars. The best song on Guitar Shop, though, is Where Were You. It is just Jeff and Hymas' keyboards here, and it is a perfect example of \\"less is more.\\" There are no 1,000 mph solos here, just atmospheric, emotional guitar playing. Other standouts include: \\"Savoy\\" and \\"A Day in the House.\\" A great album by the best guitarist ever.

0380002930|5.0|How do you review a book this excellent?  Of course, no one needs another review on Hazel and Fiver and the bunch, but ...  how can I resist?<br />When you're thinking of reading this book, please  don't think it is some thick, depressing and/or literary take on children's rabbit stories.  That's what I was afraid it was going to be, but I started reading it anyway...<br />Then, the first page was full of plant descriptions and stuff... and I was ready to close the book, thinking ::I bet this is going to be boring AND depressing!::.  Thoroughly, not-quite-fairly fed up (I hadn't even given it a decent chance), I flipped to the back  page before I gave up and closed the book.<br />You're not supposed to do that.  But it saved the book for me.<br />I was immediately struck by the parallel between the first and last lines of the book.  The first line is:  &quot;The primroses were over.&quot;<br />The last line of the book ended with  &quot;... where the first primroses were beginning to bloom.&quot;<br />Silly thing to be impressed by, huh?  But it did -- impress me, that is.  It meant: this author is going to play fair.  He wants to come full circle.<br />He means to give me a feel-good ending that is both literarily and emotionally impressive.<br />And he did.  He did.<br />Five stars is far too few.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Disc 2 on this DVD has quite a few interesting tidbits. Such as casting, a featurette on the pigs, and the premiere. And of course the standard behind-the-scenes documentary. One thing I also enjoyed was the deleted scenes with a director commentary option. Ridley Scott is interesting to listen to and you can see how and why the reasoning for removing the footage. I honestly did not think the movie justified this amount of extras, but MGM makes the most of it, and it's a pleasant surprise.<br />The movie itself is also good in it's own right. Julianne Moore easily makes you forget that the role was once Jodie Fosters. Fans may be dissapointed at the grandiose tone of the film, especially compared to the gritty realism of &quot;Silence&quot;. But if you take it for what it is, it's a decent flick. Ridley Scott is effective in making the veiwer almost root for Lecter and then yanking the rug out from under you by well placed scenes of brutality. The Doctor needs to be locked up. A nice addition to a DVD library.
B00004SCS1|5.0|First off..ive been hearing this band since i first heard them back in 95'...Before this cd came out. So when they finally got signed by American Recordings..i couldnt wait for this cd to come out. This whole damn cd rocks...its bar none their best cd..but since they only have 2 albums out..the best is yet to come. I favor this one over Toxicity because..i dont get tired of listening to it. Dont get me wrong, Toxicity is great also..but after hearing those songs getting played to death on the radio..its refreshing to pop this cd in and rock out, to some great songs. Anyways, this cd is underrated big time...one of the best rock cd's to come out in the 90's.
B00003CXI1|4.0|As a movie, this is great entertainment and (yes, I will say it along with 100's of others) wonderful family entertainment. I'm 30 and I was captivated. It ranks with Wizard of Oz, E.T. and Star Wars, even Miracle on 34th St.. As a matter of fact a comparison for those who are worried that it maybe too intense for kids would be the Wicked Witch of the West. Really a solid film for all ages. But getting to the deleted scenes while cute at first, by making you go through a series of puzzles in order to get to them, can get downright annoying if you want to get to it quick. Example: Thanksgiving day our family was watching and wanted to see the deleted scenes. 15 minutes later, five adults over 25 were still trying to figure it out! It's funny now, but just be warned. Also a note for collectors and film buffs: The rest of the features on the DVD, save for a featurette, is geared for kids. Virtual tours, sorting hat etc.. It's safe fun and, in my humble opinion, I'm sure a 9 year old suffering from a few goosebumps will be able to breeze through the puzzles in record time. So parents rest easy. Great movie.
B00005K9LN|3.0|First of all I would like to say this is a great metal album and a very good Judas Priest album.  There is no doubt this album hits hard from start to finish, with some incredibly solid songwriting, some usual great singing by Rob and some great solos by Tipton.  There is no doubt there are some riffs on this album that will immediately stick in your head, not wanting to ever go away like Rapid Fire, Metal Gods and Grinder.<br />However I do not agree with people saying this is Priest's creative height.  As a matter of fact I think its a step down creatively from the heights of Sad Wings of Destiny, Sin After Sin, Stained Class and Hell Bent for Leather.  <br />British Steel offers very little in the way of experimentation, save for the reggae feel of The Rage, and even that only lasts for a total of a minute through the song.  This album shows Judas Priest simplifying their riffs and simplifying their lyrics, and it was a major success for them.  Whether they made these changes to appeal to a wider audience or it was simply something they wanted to do musically doesn't really matter, but this album abandons the progressive tendancies that all of their previous studio albums had.<br />I feel bad not saying great things about this album, because I really do like it.  However it must be said that this was the start of the &quot;arena metal&quot; Priest and the end of the  with progressive rock experimentation Priest.  Who can blame them though, they had achieved such greatness with their innovative albums in the 70's (especially with Stained Class and Hell Bent for Leather), it was time to make a change, and they were rewarded with huge amounts of success.
B00000FCBC|2.0|When I say this, I mean this, I am the biggest Metallica fan out there, I absolutly love their music.  When I first bought this album I knew it was all covers.  Well in short I bought this, and I found about 7 songs that I liked on it.  Usually on Metallica's CD's I like all of them, and I never I mean NEVER get tired of hearing them. After about a month I couldn't stand to hear them any longer.  This CD isn't that muscially good.  But in part, I need to say that Metallica is still the greatest band ever.  They just played covers, made millions on it, hey I dont blame them, dont buy this album, just listen to it somewhere else.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is a must own for any No Doubt lover. My girlfriend is a huge fan of No Doubt and has all their cd's, and after listening to them over a period of time I got hooked on them. I am a converted No Doubt lover. My girlfriend and I are apart a lot of the time because we go to different universities, but no matter how far the distance, we know we can always listen to this album to remind ourselves about one another with brilliant magnifcient songs like: &quot;Underneath It All&quot;, and my favorite &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;. I think &quot;Running&quot; is their best song on the track and I love its lyrics because anyone whos ever been in a long distance relationship can relate to this song. &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;In My Head&quot; are all also great. All the tracks are awesome. I can listen to this CD from begining to end and play it over and over again. Now thats when you know its an Awesome Cd. This should be in everyone's CD collection.

B00005JM93|3.0|Gasper Noe's feature film \\"Irrersible\\" is destined to be a topic of hot debate when it was shown in Canne Film Festival.  It is reported that during the rape scene that lasts almost 10 minutes, many viewers left the theatre.  And there are people who defend it, and people who attack it, as is often the case with this kind of unusual films.  However, instead of joining the debate, I would like to tell what I saw on screen as I remember, even though I was curiously attracted to the ultra-violent story of revenge.<br />The story, which director Noe thought of very casually, is very simple in itself.  Beautiful Alex (Monica Bellucci, real-life wife to Vincent Cassel) is a fiancee of fun-loving Marcus (Vincent Cassel), but one night after a party Alex is raped by a man and moreover her face is heavily smashed by the guy to make her unconscious.  Knowing that, Marcus hurries to the culprit with his friend Pierre to a bar for the most violent kind of revenge in the movie history.<br />Now I warn you.  The rape/revenge scenes are both so intense and realistic that some of you might get sick during the course even though you happen to know that Noe used CGIs to enhance the effect of violence.  But to be fair, these scenes are, I thought, overlong but nothing gratuitous.  Still, it looks as if the director wallows in making us feel uncomfortable, and I admire, without any sarcasm, his skiils so good at that.  <br />Another unusual aspect of the film is that the story goes chronologically backward.  Noe insists on this idea so much that what you see first on screen is \\"the end credit\\" which rolls up (and see many names of cast, which are printed the wrong way).  And you will first see the result of revenge, then revenge itself, and then the cause of the revenge ... and so on.  The trip is exactly from hell to heaven, which we know is about to collapse.<br />And the camera, especially during the first 30 minutes, goes on rolling around so that you may feel seasickness.  The rotating motion is NOT that of handy camera of \\"Blair Witch Project,\\"  but the fact remains that we feel very uncomfortable, and we have that subject matter.  The noise-like soundtrack is also effective to make us feel uneasy -- like David Lynch's films -- and the actors are so terrifyingly convincing including the rapist Jo Prestia (professinal actor and ex-boxer).<br />Some audiences try to defend the film by saying that Noe is only trying to tell the truth, and if so, he clearly made his point.  And I can understand that viewpoint -- we have seen an equally unsettling rape scene in one Jodie Foster film; and as for violence, Oscar winner Steven Spielberg is not a stranger to violence if you remember his WW2 film.  But those films never brought the violence to the forefront as Gasper Noe did.  In a sense, that is an admirable thing.  But if you want to pay some money for seeing that ... well, if depends.  I just happened to think so.<br />From the purely technical point of view, Director Noe shows his ability to create an unnerving atmosphere.  The film is shot in a unique way -- using only one shot for each scene -- so, after  one scene starts, it goes on till the scene changes to the next.  As this now very rarely used method is employed -- though some of them are the result of post-production work, which pieced together some different takes -- each shot is consequently very long, causing us another reason for having to be patiently following the ever-moving camera, which easily beats that of Brian DePalma.<br />For all its techinical achievement, \\"Irreversible\\" suffers from its own methond of storytelling.  Compared with the violent first half, the latter peaceful part looks inevitably much weaker.  Sometimes, the back-through-time tactics create an original effect; when we see too frivolous Marcus, who ignores the presence of Alex at party, we feel sense of tragedy and folly of humans, as we know what is going to happen after that scene.  The film has some unexpected moments when we think -- imagining \\"what if\\" situations which, as you know, are always  very futile attempts of humans as every history tells.  And of course, I know that by the combination of Alex's heaven and hell, Noe is making his own commentary about our life.  The film tells us twice on screen \\"Time destroys everything\\" and, right, that's another point.  But I am afraid the method is too simple and too obvious, and doesn't hold well not least after such intense violence.<br />Still you want to see?  OK, then, here's some tips for you that might make you understand this one better, which I quote from the booklet I bought at mutiplex in Japan.  1) Noe thought of the concept of \\"Irreversible\\" in May, 2001, using Cassel and possibly Bellucci.  But as she was to work for two \\"Matrix\\" films from September, he had very short time to prepare for actual shooting.  2) They shot the sequences chronologically, I mean in this case, from \\"heaven\\" to \\"hell.\\"  3) You see Philippe Nahon as ex-butcher, who was in Noe's previous films.  The dialgues are all ad-lib.  4) Noe had difficulties in \\"ending\\" the film (in this case, the most peaceful scene of Mercus and Alex making love).  There seem to have been several versions, but he decided on the present one, which shows a poster of one masterpiece film.  That film's director, now gone for some years, is famous for a film starring Malcolm McDowell, who played a role of \\"Alex\\" -- well, Noe must respect Stanley Kubrick.<br />As a whole, for my part, I confess I was very much impressed with the film.  But because of the nature of the film, I cannot \\"recommend\\" this one to you.  I wrote down what I know.  That's why I give only three stars.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I only wanted Dido's cd because of the Roswell theme and &quot;Thank You&quot;. I listened to the cd a few times and I thought it was okay, but then it was like someone switched a light on and all the songs started sounding so awesome to me. &quot;Honestly OK&quot;,&quot;Slide&quot; and &quot;I'm No Angel&quot; are a few of my favorite songs on the album. I would highly reccommend this album to everyone who loves chill music.
B00007L4OM|3.0|WASABI is a light-weight Hong Kong action film from writer/producer Luc Besson starring the always charismatic Jean Reno.<br />High-energy hi-jinks unfold when no-nonsense Paris detective Fiorentini (Reno) is summoned to Tokyo to settle the estate of the only woman he loved.  He discovers that her death was not an accident and that he's the father of a strong-willed, red-haired, Japanese teenage daughter (who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars (not yen). Oh yes, and some very, very, very bad guys want the big bucks.<br />Terrific action set pieces deliver the pleasurable jolt of the spicy title.<br />I liked this move a lot as a passing diversion.  No profound meaning, but it sure looks great and the action rarely lets up for more than a few minutes.  And there's plenty of sly wit to season the mayhem.<br />Much better than you might first guess since you're probably wondering why you haven't heard of this title.  With Reno and Besson doing their thing, it's slick and colorful and sly.
B00006L83N|5.0|I first discovered this band in early 2002 when I read some stuff about them on the Net then found their live double cd in a local music store. At first I wasn't too sure about the singer. I thought, maybe a bit over the top at times but in retrospect I have to say Russell Allen is a great great vocalist that I purely enjoy. Yes, some of his live \\"screams\\" were close to being stereotypical but I now consider everything this guy does as excellent, for lack of a better word. He's got full control of his voice/range and he does wonderful things with it. <br />  To get to the point I love everything this band does. I've now got all the releases except the very first one w/o Allen. The core-four of Divine Wings, Twilight In Olympus, \\"V\\" and now Odyssey, are all remarkable lps. I would say \\"V\\"/Odyssey are neck and neck for being the best, with Divine Wings next then Twilight. The double Live LP is also awesume, with some of the tracks better then the original as another reviewer said...I agree. The \\"Damnation Game\\" is also a good first outting for Allen but it falls just a bit short of the other 4(5) just mentioned. In all honesty I probably need to give Damnation more time before I totally decide.
B00005JLO2|3.0|The seventh(!) film version of A. E. W. Mason's rousing 1902 novel THE FOUR FEATHERS, is a gorgeous epic.  But emotionally remote as the locations.<br />Heath Ledger stars as Harry Feversham, a British soldier who inexplicably resigns from his regiment when they are ordered to the Sudan to fight &quot;fanatical Mohammedans...&quot;  He gets four feathers, symbolic of cowardice, from his comrades and his fiance, Kate Hudson.  Later he hears that his fellows are under siege and makes his way to the Sudan to redeem himself.  Wes Bentley is the best friend and Djimon Hounsou is memorable as Ledger's desert guardian.<br />Shekhar Kapur's direction is painterly and the exhilarating middle-eastern themed music by James Horner is layered with floating Arabic motifs and choral laments that sound like the muezzin's call to prayer. Lots of extras and a richly dense commentary.
B00005JLZL|5.0|... This movie is wonderful.  Kevin Spacey is outstanding.  Next to The usual suspects and Seven this is his most complex dark character yet.  If you are looking for another Usual Suspects then that is not what you will get.  The movie is Called THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE, it is unique in its own way.  GO SEE IT....  Wonderful work for Kevin Spacey......
0060900075|4.0|The only reason I gave this book only 4 stars instead of five is that the second essay, _Heaven and Hell_, struck me as rather weak.  Taken by itself, _Doors of Perception_ is definitely a 5 star work.  This book is a watershed moment in the psychedelic literature movement.  It is beautifully written, with a clear and understandable style.  Huxley has a particular knack for knowing when he has come up against the unknowable, and is able to recognize the unknowable for what it really is.  He sort of maps out the edges of the unknowable, highlighting what is within the grasp of our knowledge, while defining a clear boundary demarcating the realms of knowledge that can only become known in another life.  This, of course, was the book that inspired the great philosopher Terrance McKenna, and after reading it, you might also become inspired to try to become the next great philosopher.  _Doors of Perception_ is notable in that it triggers a desire for knowledge rather than simply expounding data.  This is definitely a good thing, and the reader can't help but be infected with a love for the astonishment and wonder that philosophy can provide.
0375410341|4.0|I read this book last week and found it quite engaging at times; it was very good, but not great.  At times it felt like Mark D. was trying too hard, and making the reader try hard too (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Before you read this book, I'd highly recommend Paul Auster's New York Trilogy instead.  Check out its reviews on amazon to get more details about it.  What House of Leaves does (or perhaps tries to do) in over 600 pages (many of them blank or with only a few words) is done in less than 350 by Auster.  And Auster's writing is just so much better--a better read, deceptively simple because of its fluid style, and understated.  Mark D's style is clunky and way too contrived at times.  Still, House of Leaves is a worthwhile read--still 4 stars--  just check out the master first: Paul Auster.
B000084T18|4.0|Shot nine times, once incarcerated, already an underground rap star, at odds with Ja Rule, and had a radio hit before his release. What did you expect the media to do, just sit by and watch ratings and magazine sells pass them by. The hype surrounding 50 Cent's Shady/Aftermath release was expected. All doubters, haters, and critics were ready to take  shots at the Queens mc once the album was released, but to their avail the pistols jammed. The album is hot, 50 has without any doubt lived up to the hype before him. The single \\"In The Club\\" is blazing the streets and over 200,000 sold during a short first week declares commerical success. The album it self is totally complete, you will find no fillers here. 50 brings the heat and takes thuggin to a  deeper darker level. Check out the Eminem produce \\"Patiently Waiting,\\" with it's apocolyptic beat and rage driven chrous. 50 spits verses in resemblence to non other than Tupac in one of his many dark tales \\"Hail Mary.\\" 50 also takes time out to show a sensitive side along side Nate Dogg in the thug romantic \\"21 Questions.\\" Many Hip Hop heads will find the fastfoward or skip button useless with an exception of the  annoying \\"Gotta Get To Heaven.\\" The album only fualts are  50's lyrics and subject matter. He really make no attempt to switch his flow and leaves a space open that deprives him from creating a Hip Hop classic. However 50 deserves mad props for making a entertaining and compelte album. A true rarity in today's hip hop genre.
0553812173|5.0|For all US fans, good news: TOR have just done a ten-book deal with Steven Erikson to publish all the existing and forthcoming titles in this wondeful series. Roll on America
B00006RIO7|5.0|Absolutely amazing- Definitely lives up to the Broadway casts that have preceded the film one.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is not \\"just another American War movie\\".<br />It's real accounts of the actual members of 506PIR of the 101st Airborne Division.<br />Thay was the intent of the film.  This film went above and beyond any of that.<br />It's a complete masterpiece.  Did you see the episodes where certain soldiers were killed as it actually happened during the war on those dates?  Did you see the \\"Breaking Point\\" episode?  That all REALLY happened.<br />BY the way, universally accepted as the \\"best\\" tanks in the war were the Russian made T series tanks.<br />Those tanks were rolling off the lines faster than any other tank and the Germans admitted they were better than the German Panzer or Tiger tanks.<br />Either way, the word \\"best\\" is subjective.<br />The Shermans were far more durable than the Panzer or Tiger tanks, but the German tanks had better armor and more firepower, as well as more manuverablity.  The trade off was durability.<br />Get your facts straight next time.<br />See this masterpiece of a film and DO NOT listen to people who repeat the same old rhetroic when it comes to war movies because they want to be different or sound like they know what they are talking about, i.e, movie critics.<br />What a fantastic film.
B00005Y1Z4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums -- Every song's a GEM!! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!
B00007H1Y2|5.0|Wonderful! I was really looking forward to this CD, based on reviews &amp; interviews with Ry Cooder, and it's really a joy! Maybe the mambo has always proven to start a fire in our hearts, and we got much spark from this. The day I got it I threw it on during a dinner party thinking it would be really cool &amp; everyone asked &quot;what is this?&quot;... in a good way. The only warning is that this collection will leave you wanting more!<br />Ry Cooder and Buena Vista fans can be enlightened once more. <BR>Open up your ears to Cuban music and enjoy your life before it's too late...
B00003CXN4|5.0|WOW! This film is utterlly AMAZING. Performances, cinematography, score, script...I honestly couldn't find any flaws with this film.<br />What is even better, is it sheds light into a world that most of us will never see, and makes us feel as if we live in it. The scene with the Drug Czar's daughter in a crack hotel (for lack of a better description) is so core-shatteringly jarring it haunts you long after the credits have rolled. Del Toro much deserved his oscar for the portayal of a mexican cop caught between the two worlds but knowing how to pit them against one another effectively, and even Catherine Zeta Jones surpassed my expectations and turned in a powerhouse performance of a woman morphing to fit her situation. Every aspect of film making is pulled together to create a story and a portrait of our society today that you will simply not forget.<br />This is one of the best purchases you will ever make towards a great DVD collection! My only disappointment is that I would like for it to have included commentary.
0743216458|5.0|From the first running up the hill at Currahee to the anit climax of no longer having an enemy to fight, this book involves you in everything.  You feel with the men of Easy Company every step of the way.  If there is a WW2 book you read this spring it has to be this one.
B000002BQK|3.0|I bought this cd back in the time when &quot;Honey&quot; was being played every where, from the radio to the clubs, to the tv and MTV.<br />Owning a previous album of Mariah Carey, &quot;Daydream&quot; I was not so impressed with this one.  There are a few catchy songs, including the hit &quot;Honey,&quot; &quot;Butterfly,&quot; and &quot;My All.&quot;  That last song is very good, with good vocals and a good sense to it.<br />Others include &quot;The Roof&quot; with Mobb Deep, that song I really like the most because Mobb Deep is in it...and it's not so bad.<br />Overall, the cd is not as I espected, but then, it is different from the other one from her &quot;Daydream.&quot;<br />A nice cd to add to your list if you like Mariah Carey.
079284131X|2.0|Why did the sequels to this get better treatment than this original classic!? Reminds me of the Vacation sequels. Release this DVD in widescreen format or you'll get no money from me.
B000002AVF|5.0|I bought this cd back in 1996, I remember it was my 3rd CD in my collection when I started buying cds.  I bought it because I would always hear on the radio that song &quot;Always be my baby&quot; and &quot;One Sweet Day.&quot;  <BR>Back then those songs were pretty much playing everywhere.  <BR>I started getting into it, and I found some beautiful songs, including &quot;Forever&quot; and &quot;Underneath the stars.&quot;<BR>&quot;I am free&quot; is also a nice song with good vocals.<BR>I would definitely recommend it to any fan of GOOD pop music.
B00005YUPO|5.0|My 15 month old daughter still loves this video.  As with every video and toy, every child may react differently.  Just because my child loves it, your's may not. My daughter starting watching Baby Bach, Baby Mozart and Baby Einstein at about 4-5 months old.  She is extremely advanced with her vocabulary and already knows her entire uppercase alphabet.  I have to attribute some of this advancement to these videos, along with other teaching tools I am using.  I show them to her on almost a daily basis and she does not get tired of them.  She is now mostly watching Baby Van Gogh, Baby Shakespere and Baby Dolittle's Neighborhood Animals.  I still get the Bach and Mozart out now and then and she hasn't forgotten them.<BR>I highly recommend all in this series and especially Bach and Mozart for younger babies.
0553381687|5.0|I read A Game of Thrones several years ago on vacation. I don't remember anything about the trip other than the plot of this book. I don't think I put it down once! Martin's adeptness with his large ensemble cast of characters is astonishing. This is a true classic.
B00000IMTH|4.0|Unfortunately the last recording of the Blackmore/Dio partnership. Although Long Live Rock 'N Roll is a brilliant album on its own, falls slightly short from the greatness of its antecesor Rising. The cause that prevents LLRR to reach a five star status is the inclussion of fillers like \\"L.A. Connection\\" and \\"Shed (Subtle)\\". However, on the other hand, there are true metal classics like \\"Gates Of Babylon\\" whose arabic influences and progressive musical tones interact perfectly with the doomy and sinister Dio's vocals, resulting in another Metal's Milestone.<br />Other highlights are the gothic masterpieces \\"Lady Of The Lake\\" and \\"Rainbow Eyes\\" as well as the rockers \\"Kill The King\\" and the title track.<br />Long Live Rock 'N Roll is an obligatory sonic experience for the true metal fan and a seminal chapter in the gothic rock saga.
B00005JLZL|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie. I like everybody in it. But in the end (without blowing the story), it was a farcical tale about a bunch of fanatics who are so obsessed with their singular ideal that when we learn the truth about what is going on, they become so completely unsympathetic to the point of being moronic.<br />If the filmmakers were trying to make a film showing the pointlessness of being such an individual, then I would have to say, \\"Job well done.\\"
6303686745|5.0|It's strange how two movies covering the same subject are released months apart in the same year. Especially how one of the two films are successful at the box office. The other, not so successful. That is the case of two films being released by Columbia Pictures in 1964, when the United States Of America was still recovering from the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War was still at an all time high. The two films were none other than Stanley Kubrick's Cold War satire Dr. Starngelove (made entirely in England) and Sidney Lumet's classic anti-war picture Fail-Safe. While the late Kubrick's picture dealt with the madness of nuclear war on the black comedy level, Fail-Safe approached the subject from a much more serious perspective. The results led to the movie going public being scared out of their wits, for fear of something like this actually happening. Kubrick's film dealt with man going mad and declaring war. Lumet's film dealt with the machines breaking down and leading the human race on the road to global annihilation. Or to be more precise, it shows us what the consequences are when humanity puts too much trust in the machine and its systems. There is always a margin for error when man and machine are moving too fast and become dependent on one another.<br />Fail-Safe begins in Omaha, Nebraska with a US Congressman being given a tour of the Startegic Air Command's control facility by the commanding officer. What seems to be a minor electronic malfunction occurs during an alert when SAC bombers are flying at their fail-safe points. From there, the situation rapidly worsens and bombers are given an order to fly to their targets in the Union of the Soviet Socialistic Republic. The President and the Omaha staff try desperately to recall the planes and it looks for a while like they have succeeded. They then notice that one group of planes, Group Six, is still flying toward Russia. The group is unable to receive the recall code because the Russians are experimenting with new radio jamming proceedures. The supporting fighter planes are returning to their base in Alaska when they are informed of the dilemma with Group Six. They are ordered to turn around and try to intercept the group wing and shoot them down if necessary. Everyone involved knows that this is a desperate measure because the fighters are low on fuel. They fall into the Arctic Ocean before even getting close to Group Six. The President and the people at NORAD eventually help the Russians to try to stop Group Six. What follows is a shocking end that will bring back memories of September 11th, 2001 AD. One wishes that the city of Los Angeles was the victim instead of....well, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out.<br />With its multi-dimensional screenplay (based precisely on the original 1962 novel) and solid acting from the astounding cast (Henry Fonda, Larry Hagman, Fritz Weaver, Frank Overton, Dom DeLuise, Walter Matthau, Dan O'Herlihy, Sorrell Brooks, Edward Binns, and Dana Elcar), Fail-Safe still brings the message across after forty years. Not only does it reflect the political and social issues of the time, it still states that sometimes our weapons can grow faster than our wisdom. The Cold War maybe over, but the human race still face the possibility of a nuclear war with the likes of the entire Middle East and North Korea.<br />Fail-Safe is still a gripping reminder that something tragic as this could still happen. It will also make you stop and think.
0393307050|5.0|I had never heard of the &quot;Aubrey/Maturin&quot; series until I saw a preview for the movie that is coming out later this year.  I thought the movie looked interesting so I wanted to get a jump-start and read the book before I saw the movie.  Well, even to my surprise, I was almost unable to put this book down.  I ordered the second book right away so I wouldn't have to wait to see what happens next, and I'm glad I did.  This book was an absolutely fabulous one to read, and really served well to draw me into the rest of the series.  I eagerly await the future exploits of the &quot;HMS Sophie&quot; and her crew over the next 19 books!!
B00006L3IE|5.0|This recording remains a classic, even if (as Daniel Leech-Wilkinson points out in his accompanying notes) some of Munrow's performance practices may be disputed today. This is, quite simply, a wonderful performance and a terrific sounding recording (even after nearly 30 years)--and a wonderful way to develop an ear for the music of the 13th and 14th centuries.
0395925037|4.0|This book has got to be the most influencial book that one can read. I've read the entire book twice and i'm only 17. The idea's and &quot;ramblings&quot; as all you protalitariats call it would actually work. People should just give his book a chance in society today. It would be such a better place.
6303394000|4.0|...then this is the ultimate compliment film. It gives a lot of the same excited atmosphere and electricity of a Fosse Broadway show; never mind that it is autobiographical or- as less friendlier critics like to repeat over and over again- a bit self-indulgent; it is the essence of the man who was a showman from his first dance steps to his burlesque-musical imagined death. The George Benson \\"On Broadway\\" opening/audition elimination is electrifying, funny (note the man who can't dance at all), and gloriuosly sexy (women with long legs were just meant to dance Fosse). It is only matched by the stunning \\"Take Off With Us/AirRotica\\" piece (which seamlessly transfers from a punchy, rhythmic ensemble dance to a beautiful, steamy ballet in just a few seconds). And the performers are mesmerizing- from the non-dancing Roy Scheider to Leland Palmer (who has a more than passing resemblance to Gwen Verdon) to the gorgeous, leggy Ann Reinking. The film has bumps in it- notably the \\"Lenny\\" alegories, the self-analysis, and the baseball-bat sequence of 'heartless' producers in conference juxtaposed against a truly graphic open-heart surgery- but mercifully these are few and far between. I was glad to know that it garnered Fosse another directoral Oscar nomination.
B00008BXJG|5.0|I remember standing in a record store in some strip mall in Bellevue, Washington, in the late fall of 1979, asking my dad to buy me this record.  I was 12 and didn't really know anything about the group; I had just noticed that the title track, Highway to Hell, was number 2 on the charts (or something like that), and I thought I would give them a try.  The album blew me away (much to the irritation of my parents, and even my older brother, who thought AC/DC would never be as cool as KISS).<br />For me, AC/DC never got any better than this.  Back in Black may have the song everybody knows - You Shook Me All Night Long - but in terms of songwriting, musicianship, and production, Highway to Hell is the ultimate AC/DC disc from first note to last.  Every song on this album is great.  And this remaster is excellent; the recording sounds new, and appropriately raw as ever.<br />Bon Scott, you will never be forgotten.
B00006F7S4|2.0|For the first time, Beck goes serious.  It's not like I don't understand his need to explore his real feelings with conventional words, but it's just not the same as when he sang tunes such as \\"Death is coming to get you\\", \\"Let's go moon some cars\\", and \\"Whiskeyfaced Radioactive Blowdryin' Lady\\". I've always listened to Beck because he was the only guy out there making completely and truly irreverent music - making a mockery of the very concept of meaning in music.  <br />I can't say the new album is bad, but to me it's just not Beck anymore.
0694003611|5.0|We started reading this to my son each night before bedtime.  At 15 months old, he brings it to me each night and turns the pages for us...as well as pointing out the objects. This is truly the perfect bedtime story for children.
6304696515|4.0|This film is marvellous adaptation of the novel. Many changes and liberties were made, but it would have been nearly impossible to make this work as a straight adaptation since the book is nothing but a series of letters. <br />Well acted, this film really captures the nastiness and excessive nature of the two antagnists played so excellently by Glenn Close and John Malkovich.<BR>Michelle Pieffer is wonderful as the woman who helps Valmont discover true love. Lovely and tragic.<BR>I enjoyed both Uma and Keeanu as the young pawns/lovers but I felt they were both too old to play the characters. Uma seemed much to mature to be 15 year old Cecille.<BR>A earlier review mentions the film Valmont as a remake of this film, that is incorrect. Both films were made during the exact same year, unfortunatly Milos Forman waited an extra year to release his somewhat weaker version so it feels like it is a pale imitation of this version. Neither film had anything to do with the other except they used the same novel as their basis.<BR>Cruel Intentions however is a blatent modern day remake and is actualy quiet good with Reece Witherspoon(Pleasantville, Sweet Home Alabama), Sarah Michelle Geller(Buffy the Vampire Slayer-TV), Ryan Phillipe and others. It is well acted and it is quite interesting to see the interpritations of the same events from DL in the 20th century.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The long-awaited film adaptation of the hit musical \\"Chicago\\" has finally arrived, and it's sure to be a big hit at the Oscars this year. Like the film itself, the \\"Chicago\\" soundtrack album is also very enjoyable, though not 100% perfect. On the plus side, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere & Renee Zellweger, along with Queen Latifah & John C. Reilly, are all up to the challenge of singing these great, vaudeville-style tunes by composer John Kander & lyricist Fred Ebb, such as \\"All That Jazz,\\" \\"When You're Good To Mama,\\" \\"Roxie,\\" \\"Mr. Cellophane,\\" and \\"Razzle Dazzle.\\" I knew Zeta-Jones would be an electrifying singer---she has musical theater training under her belt---but Gere, Zellweger and the rest of the cast are all surprisingly good singers themselves. And the musicians on the album bring these big, brassy tunes to life with great gusto.On the debit side, the movie version of \\"Chicago\\" does not contain the entire song score from the original stage show. Songs like \\"A Little Bit Of Good,\\" \\"My Own Best Friend,\\" \\"I Know A Girl,\\" and \\"Me And My Baby\\" are nowhere to be found. The filmmakers say these tunes were dropped because they just didn't fit the movie's framework, but it's still a disappointment. Luckily, there's still a rendition of \\"Class\\" on the album (although it was cut from the film), plus one new song, \\"I Move On,\\" which is a fine duet for Zeta-Jones & Zellweger. But the inclusion of Danny Elfman's incidental music is merely filler, and Lord knows there was absolutely NO need to include the rap version of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" by Queen Latifah, Lil' Kim & Macy Gray, or \\"Love Is A Crime\\" by Anastacia. Chances are you'll be hitting the stop button on your CD player when these two tracks come on! Fortunately, they're at the very end of the disc. So, the \\"Chicago\\" movie soundtrack is a great disc most of the way, even though a few songs from the original show are missing. However, if you really love the movie version of \\"Chicago,\\" then I strongly recommend checking out any of the three \\"Chicago\\" stage show soundtracks that are also available on CD, *especially* my personal favorite of the bunch, the 1998 London cast recording with Ute Lemper & Ruthie Henshall. It's a barnburning rendition of the show, and it includes the complete song score in it's entirety. And no rap songs. :-)
B00008HCCF|5.0|Norah Jones recently swept up the Grammys, winning all five awards she was up for including Record &amp; Album of the year.  All were well deserved and on the heels of that success, she picked the right time to release her first DVD.  It's from a performance from July, 2002 at The House of Blues in New Orleans and it captures the essence of her music.  The show is cool and laid back, and a throwback to vintage stylings as is the DVD's direction.  The camera work lingers on Ms. Jones and her band for long moments, allowing the viewer to soak in each performer's image.  We get long close-ups and not the usual herky-jerky, fast cuts of most concert films.  The concert contains almost every song from her lone album,  Come Away With Me as well as some choice covers including a standout version of The Band's \\"Bessie Smith\\".  For fans of Ms. Jones, the DVD is great companion piece to her award winning album and an excellent concert film.
B00008HCCF|5.0|This DVD is a great intro to the phenom that is Norah.  The music is great, the sound quality of the 5.1 recording is fab (think ECM), but the biggest treat is watching Norah - she seems truly astonished at her popularity with the House of Blues crowd!<BR>If you have heard the CD, you will love the live versions; they are even better. If you are new to her - get an eyeful of classic music-making, no belly-shaking!!!
B00005RHGL|5.0|George P. Cosmatos epic western 'Tombstone' is the western genre at its fullest capability. It's the story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and his brothers, especially focusing around Tombstone and its aftermath. Kurt Russell plays Wyatt Earp, Val Kilmer plays Doc Holliday, Sam Elliott plays Virgil Earp, Bill Paxton plays Morgan Earp, Powers Boothe plays Curly Bill, Michael Biehn plays Johnny Ringo, Jason Priestley plays Deputy Billy Breckinridge, Stephen Lang plays Ike Clanton, Thomas Haden Church plays Billy Clanton, Dana Delany plays Josephine Marcus, Billy Zane plays Fabian--all play their roles brilliantly. Charleton Heston, Billy Bob Thornton Wyatt Earp III, and Micheal Rooker have cameos and Robert Mitchum narrates. I mean with a cast like that how can you go wrong. The story is great, the cinematography is great, the writing is great, and the production value is great. You cannot go wrong with this film. And the dvd is a 2 disc set, packaged very nicely in a slipcover case with a map of Tombstone. It contains a commentary track, a three part making of featurette, a 'tombstone timeline', the OK Corral storyboard sequence, Faro for the computer, and other extras. It's a great movie and a great value for the dvd package.
0385335482|5.0|I was reading this book at my hairdressers and started laughing so hard that Perrier came out of my nose. To anyone who has ever put off paying a bill to buy a new pair of shoes, this is a must. It gives you a fun idea of London life and the main character is so loveable and out of control that you will miss her when you finish reading. There is an scene that pokes fun at British morning television that should not be read in public unless you want to embarass yourself.<BR>The girl in the story is not some hopeless damsel in distress waiting for a man to rescue her. She actually tries to better herself even if the results are sometime disasterous. I love this writer and the follow up book is just a good. You'll love it.
B0000009SI|5.0|When I got into Zappa this was one of the first albums I heard. Now 24 years later when looking back on FZ's carrier I have to say that this is maybe his best album. No doubts that it was (still is?) so popular. The CD release in the 80's however made me a little disappointed but it's still great music. I prefer my almost mint condition US LP. The album provides great songs spanning from basic rock/blues groove to tricky zappa-ish interludes. Even if the music is really complex here and there it's never hard to listen to it. There is a wide line up of top musicians. And the sound...with the exception of the title track itself which is a bit rough, the sound sort of jumps out on you. Try listening to the Yellow Snow suite through a pair of decent ear phones.<BR>The best songs on this album will probably always feel fresh: <BR>* The Yellow Snow suite with all of those fantastic little musical details<BR>* Excentrifugal Forz; The opening melody always gets me off, it's probably derived from an improvised guitar phrase that FZ had the violinist to double<BR>* The gospel-ish Uncle Remus<BR>* Stink-Foot; a simple and sort of laid back song, but still grooving!
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie is BETTER (yes, better) than its prequel, The Fellowship of the Ring!  There is colossal computer effects, a total change in the musical score, and, of course, great adventure and action.<BR> Frodo and Sam are on the way to Mordor alone.  But \\"alone\\" is not really what they are.  Gollum, or Smagol, is on their trail.  Frodo manages to get through to Gollum so that he now sees Frodo as his master, and leads them into Mordor.  <BR> Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are hot on the trail of the Uruk-hai that took Merry and Pippin.  And while they are unable to retrieve the hobbits themselves (who find their own way out), they are intercepted by an old, unexpected friend...Gandalf!  But returned as Gandalf 'the White'.<BR> The Two Towers introduces us to more characters such as Thoden, the king of Rohan who has been overpowered by Saruman through Grma Wormtongue.  There is also owyn, and her brother, omer.  owyn is presented as a young woman who is dying to prove herself and also adds to the romantical conflict of Aragorn and Arwen.  Faramir, also, is introduced.  He's the brother of Boromir who died in the last movie.  There are new places:  Fangorn Forest, Rohan, Helm's Deep, the Dead Marshes.  <BR> The anticipated battle of Helm's Deep by readers won't disappoint anyone; it's EXCELLENT!  However, I personally felt slightly undaunted, having known the battle's outcome.  But you do get a certain adrenaline rush each time you see it.<BR> The one difference between 'Fellowship' and 'Towers' is that in the first there was always things happening that seemed to jump-start you so much that you found yourself gripping the edge of your seat out of anticipation; as if even the movie's atmosphere wasn't to be trusted.  But in 'Towers', it has calmed down some.  You still feel a certain untrustworthiness, especially in Gollum, and you definitely feel hopeless at times.  How are they ever going to survive against ten thousand Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep?  How isFrodo ever going to hold out, as he slowly begins to break?  Those are just a couple of questions that go through your mind.  <BR> I always have to comment on a film's music.  The score was totally different in that there was a Rohan theme on a Norwegian violin, as well as new vocals (Isabel Bayrakdarian, Ben del Maestro, Emiliana Torrini) and the most glorious, victory-ridden sequence I have ever heard in my life which adds up all the film's physical and mental strifes.  There are also small snippet reprises from the 'Fellowship' score.  Howard Shore did very, very well.<BR> Peter Jackson and his team of filmmakers are some pretty serious filmmakers.  Their fantastic teamwork really shines in this film's final cut, and that, I'm sure, goes for 'Fellowship' and 'Return of the King'.
B000065U1N|5.0|Director Ridley Scott followed up his Academy Award winning film Gladiator with another tale of war and battle. In Black Hawk Down, he moves from the battlefields and coliseums of ancient Rome, to the modern day battlefield of Mogadishu, Somalia.  Black Hawk Down is based on a series of articles and subsequent book by Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Mark Bowden who recounts the story of an elite unit of Delta Force soldiers and Army Rangers who are part of a U.N. peacekeeping force who are trying to capture two lieutenants of local Mogadishu crime lord Mohamed Farah Aidid in October of 1993.  Most of the men are getting their first taste of real combat and although the mission is considered dangerous, it is supposed to be fairly routine.  But upon their decent into the city, two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down by enemy fire and all hell breaks lose.  The Americans are committed to get every man, either dead or alive, out of the city and in the process become surrounded.  The firefight between the Americans and Somalis is a harrowing and gruesome affair that lasts for fifteen hours.  It is the longest  ground battle involving American troops since the Vietnam War.  When the fighting ends, eighteen Americans are dead and seventy others wounded.  Mr. Scott uses an almost documentary like approach to the film and the camera work is stunning.  The battle scenes are eerily realistic and brutal.  The film is painstakingly detailed in the visual end but it does sacrifice character development.  We never really get to know the men involved in the battle.  That is small price to pay for the overall visual greatness of the film.  The cast is filled with fresh and familiar faces.  Josh Hartnett is the central character and is surrounded by other young stars as Ewan MacGregor, Orlando Bloom (Legolas from The Lord of the Rings), Eric Bana (star of the upcoming Hulk film) as well as veterans like Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepard.  The film won two richly deserved Academy Awards, one for Sound and the other for Film Editing, but Mr. Scott lost out for Best Director for the second year in a row.ne for Sound and the other for Film Editing, but Mr. Scott lost out for Best Director for the second year in a row.

Even if you already own the threatical version of this flick, it is worth getting for the commentary alone which is almost as funny as the movie--especially Bruce's comment about how the extras walking around in one scene all look like they \\"have a load\\" in their pants--and he's right!<br />Although I already have 1 of the 40,000 copies of the Limited Edition, I'm still thinking of getting this one for a \\"back up\\".

B00005JKZT|5.0|I loved every minute of this awesome masterpiece of cinematography.  There, I've said it all up front and I make no apologies.  Let's be honest, Jackson had the best of all stories to work with.  The movie was never going to fail on story line, it was only doomed if Jackson couldn't pull off the monumental task of transposing the epic trilogy to the big screen while doing justice to the sumptuous splendour of Tolkein's book.  The Two Towers revolves around the Battle of Helms Deep.  A battle that ranks in my humble opinion as one of the most inspiring in cinematic history.  Certainly it is 90% CGI, but that is mainstream cinema these days and it is accepted by this reviewer, who still appreciates old-fashioned moviemaking. The Battle of Helms Deep ranks with me as my all-time favourite movie battle, co-equal with the battle-scenes in the epic movie `The Battle of Waterloo' (...) and `Saving Private Ryan'.  If the `Battle of Helms Deep' was spectacular then the creature Gollum was nothing short of brilliant.  This is CGI gone mega-marvellous. Gollum left me gob-smacked. The creators at Weta Productions have set a benchmark here that leaves other notables fumbling for their keyboards and mice.  Nothing George Lucas has ever done (and I am a great Star Wars fan) comes close to this wizardry.  It's worth the price of admission just to see Gollum.  Dare I repeat myself but I admire everything about the Two Towers.  The great scenery, the story, the costumes, the creatures, the action.  They form the ingredients for a feast that we savour for three swashbuckling hours.  Let's dispense with the negatives.  Sure the move is not absolutely true to the book.  But there isn't a director on the planet that could have captured the whole story in just over three hours. Some things had to miss out, and I'm sure that was one of the tougher parts of the production, deciding what doesn't make the final cut.  The ending was a big call, and readers of the book will know what I am talking about.  I've no complaints, only elated anticipation for the third in the trilogy.  And that's where I will end.  Not only have we been given something truly special again.  It's only the second instalment.  I've got another eleven months to savour The Two Towers and my mouth is already watering for the third and final feature.  Glorious, just glorious.

B00005JKHP|3.0|The first of the popular sci-fi franchise, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is also the entry that I feel most divided on.  Here is a film that strives to be cerebral and thought-provoking, a movie made with the best of intentions, but in doing so, much of the appeal of Star Trek is lost.  Yes, the warm and witty &quot;human&quot; element is missing.  The characters that are here are certainly those of the crew of the starship enterprise, but change their names and they could simply be a different crew entirely.<br />The premise is interesting, and certainly less campy than one might reasonably have suspected back in 1979.  The film opens with three Klingon bird-of-preys that are attacked and engulfed by a giant alien cloud.  Concern about this heightens when the course trajectory for the anomaly shows it's heading for Earth.  Sent to prevent this possible global-scale destruction is Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), who takes back the command of the starship Enterprise from Captain Will Decker (Stephen Collins, the guy from 7th Heaven, believe it or not).  <br />On the bridge of the ship include old crew members Sulu (George Takei), Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Chekov (Walter Koenig), and good old Mr. Scott (James Doohan) down in engineering.  Brought out of retirement is Dr. Bones McCoy (DeForrest Kelley), against his will, too, but eventually grudgingly tags along.  With Spock (Leonard Nimoy) the last to arrive, the crew is reunited in their journey to the mysterious alien cloud, a hostile entity which appears to be alive.<br />What I've just described probably sounds like a great adventure, and make no doubt about it, several aspects of the film are terrific, even brilliant.  But overall, The Motion Picture is maddeningly inconsistent, often poorly placed, and sloppy in terms of plot execution.  In some ways, this doesn't even feel like the Star Trek many had come to know and love back in the late 60's.  TMP is sincere in its attempts to be a cerebral saga, sodirector Robert Wise makes certain to take the film as deadly serious as possible; there's not an ounce of good humor to be found here.<br />Given the premise, such a concept should be taken seriously, but not at the expense of the characters or the entertainment value.  TMP does sport its tense moments, particularly in the opening scenes and later when the Enterprise enters the cloud and the crew slowly makes some startling discoveries about the anomaly's origin.  The scene where an entity seemingly made of light invades the bridge and attacks the crew is even quite frightening, simply because Wise, well, wisely knows to keep us interested by venturing into the unknown. <br />But much of the portion set in the cloud is rather tedious.  Too much of it is spent looking at bizarre images as opposed to the crew speculating on the cloud's purpose and existence.  Does anyone remember that similar The Next Generation episode, where the crew finds themselves trapped inside this black anomaly and encounter a higher being called Nagilum?  Those 45 minutes were creepier and more entertaining than TMP.  That's not to say all the material involving the alien anomaly isn't involving.  The last half-hour finally gets to the speculation and theories we expect, so it makes for a thoroughly entertaining climax.<br />The cast is about what you'd expect if you're a fan of the series.  William Shatner's acting style is a sincere attempt at being serious, and no, it's not a particularly impressive performance, but he is the embodiment of Kirk.  Surprisingly, Shatner would go on to deliver impressive performances throughout the rest of the series.  Nimoy and Kelley are good as always.  But the main focus of the film appears to be with Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta.  They've got a weird pseudo-romance going on, or had at one point.  Neither performance is very good, but Khambatta still looks beautiful even with a bald head.  <br />So it seems my appreciation for The Motion Picturelies mostly in the visual and auditory sense.  The special effects, great for their time, are still eye-popping by today's standards, if not also slightly dated.  Arguably even more impressive is Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score, a memorable theme which outdoes even John Williams' work in Star Wars.  Both aspects deserved their Oscar nominations.<br />With this film, it often feels as if though the filmmakers were just desperate to introduce Star Trek to the series, and thus didn't quite put as much effort into this as they could have.  The potential for a character-oriented epic adventure was there, but Wise left out the characters, so what we're left with is a visually spectacular saga that didn't quite reach the mark it should have.  I still recommend The Motion Picture, but at least five of the sequels would turn out to be better (or at least more enjoyable) films (First Contact, The Undiscovered Country, The Voyage Home, The Wrath of Khan, and Generations).
B000000H40|5.0|This album sets the standard for death metal; that's how good it is. In a genre where far too many bands opt for all-out speed at the expense of power, Obituary keeps the pace down and gains unmatched crunch. The production is absolutely fantastic, vocalist John Tardy is in top form and guitar mercenary James Murphy adds som nice melodic touches to the wall of sound. The bite of \\"Chopped in half\\" and \\"Find the arise\\" have yet to be topped by any later release by any band. <br />The only metal album better than this one is Slayer's \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\", and if you want just one death metal CD in your collection, this should be it. Enjoy!
B00005YW4H|4.0|This CD is wonderful, and I especially enjoy hearing old favorites like &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; done in Norah's fabulous minimalist style, but she can do better. I'm not thinking of the future, but the past -- songs off her demo tape (cd) and from live performances such as WFUV on 12/29/01, The Living Room, NYC on 09/20/00, and her two tracks on The Charlie Hunter Quartet's _Songs From The Analog Playground_ show that Norah has an even greater depth and geater skill than evident on _Come Away With Me_. <br />I found out about Norah from one of the otherwise crummy magazines I read while waiting for my car to get an alignment, before she made the radio in my area. I'm glad, too, because I've already been burnt out on _Come Away With Me_'s title track. Some of my favorites include Holding On, World of Trouble, High on a Hill, All Day Long I've Been Crying, Ain't Gonna Ask You, Turn Me On, and Day is Done (w/ Charlie Hunter Quartet).  All demonstrate a much larger range than you might expect from this young lady. <br />As for her unexpected popularity and hyperbolic reviews... I don't think she deserves 8 Grammys (yet), or five stars, but given the homogeneous horsehooey that most people are forcefed a la Clear Channel and Top 40 stations, for someone doing something so different to get airplay must be like a revelation to most people. That's my theory, anyway. I also think it accounts for people who think the whole album sounds the same -- if it doesn't include drastic and obvious changes from song to song in tone, style, and instrumentation, it must be seem the same to people's pop-battered ear -- if you eat Tabasco with everything, it will be hard to taste subtlety.
B00005JLXC|3.0|Daredevil had the makings of an excellent movie.  To bad the director didn't know that.  The camera work was the pits on this one and the ending was way to unbelieveable even for a superhero fantasy.  A hero who is too injured to help the love of his life, but can beat up two (yes, count them please--two) bad guys? No way.
0515125024|3.0|Die Trying is my first taste of author Lee Child.  Hero Jack Reacher, an innocent bystander is thrust into a life and death struggle when he is inadvertently taken hostage along with FBI agent, Holly Johnson. Die Trying is not a serious book, despite the subject matter.  Reacher is an implausible former military policeman who is able to single-handedly defeat the hostage takers, raking up an impressive body count along the way. Child has certainly done his research and if you have an interest in the military and the operations of the FBI then aspects of the book will appeal.  He is very descriptive when it comes to weaponry and military equipment.  The book's story line is pretty straightforward with few unexpected twists.  It relies on action to keep you interested, and a `Rambo' type performance is what you get from Jack Reacher. I would recommend this book to action buffs with an interest in the military and FBI.  The story line is ho hum, but if you want a detailed description of what a M16 will do to a human head at 100 yards using 5.56mm calibre bullets designated M855, then look no further than `Die Trying'. If you're after an action packed, thinking person's book with a slick story line, I suggest you try elsewhere.  Something by Gerald Seymour may be of interest. Did I enjoy the book?  Appreciating the book for what it was, yes I did.  I confess it took me a month of picking it up and putting it down for days on end, but it managed to fill in the time on the ferry trip from Half Moon Bay to downtown Auckland.  From my perspective, an average read that was mildly entertaining.  Recommended as a filler.

B00004X01U|5.0|A lot of people do not like this album and claim it is effortless and not creative. Or that it is too weird. But that's the creative genius that is Madonna. She's not going to stay in a mold and make perfect pop songs until she's 60. This is my favourite Madonna album, because she takes such risks and it seems like its is a blend of different ideas. Music, the title track is suprisingly my least favourite on the album maybe because its been overkilled at the radio. Impressive Instant is a great tune, it makes you want to dance all night and features the silly but great lyrics, &quot;I like to singy, singy, singy&quot; This song seems to be the most popular with the &quot;youth&quot; out there. Runaway Lover sounds like it could be from the ROL album, but its still a great dance song. I Deserve It is a wonderful country tinged electronic ballad. Amazing does sound like Beautiful Stranger but a great song nonetheless. Nobody's Perfect and Paradise are two of my favourite tracks. Dark, Melancholy and Haunting, these just leave you wanting more. Dont Tell Me features start and stop electronic country beats, while What It Feels Like For A Girl and Gone are great ballads. Madonna displays a great album with a variety of musical styles.
B00005JLXC|5.0|There is something extremely deep, dark and foreboding about Mark Steven Johnson's \\"Daredevil.\\" In many surface ways it is like the Tim Burton \\"Batman\\": with even the daylight scenes taking on a muted, smoky, fuzzy ambience probably as a way of showing how our blind hero views the external world.<br />Daredevil is like no other Super-Hero of recent memory though, for his human traits out number his extraordinary ones: he is first and foremost a feeling human being searching for a way to avenge the death of his father and doing it in the only way he knows how...by killing off all those who have done his father wrong.<br />Ben Affleck plays the Daredevil as a vulnerable man prone to all the usual human foibles even though possessing super-human traits: hearing, smelling and interpreting voice and motivation. Affleck is a conflicted hero, prone to seek the guidance of his priest and feeling flummoxed and unsure by all that he does.<br />Jennifer Garner plays Electra, Daredevil's love and ultimately his nemesis with a physicality and sexual allure only hinted at by her TV series, \\"Alias.\\"<br />Garner and Affleck are like Superman in that they are above reproach in their behavior in the world that they inhabit. It is up to Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to throw a wrench in the proceedings with his over-the-top prerformance.He kills as sport and stands for everything that Daredevil and Electra do not: rampant humanity gone berserk. Farrell is disgustingly assertive, aggressive and repulsive: a great, physical performance.<br />\\"Daredevil\\" is a success because it takes itself very seriously and does so without the least amount of adherence to any known code of ethics. It creates an extraordinary world and inhabits it with characters that have the ring of truth and substantial humanity that strike us as reality, though perhaps jaded, in our world as it stands today in this year, 2003.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Possibly one of the most original alternative films I've seen in the past years, Donnie Darko is a powerful mind stimulator.<BR>   A brilliant deep-cutting script combined with intimidating acting and careful directing is what you get here but the more thoughtful viewers will also be awarded with valuable and out of the mainstream questions.<BR>   A young teen diagnosed with bordeline schizophrenia starts having weird meetings with a human size rabbit who looks part alien, part reptile, part artificial, and who carries a message of doom for Donnie Darko (the boy, and yes, that's his name)..Donnie begins to take the message very seriously but simoultaneously he begins paying attention to the world around him and in him. He understands with the help of his \\"friend\\" that nothing you see and observe is accidental.<br />      Predictably, he comes at odds with the people he tries to convey this message to (\\"the world will end in 28 days\\"), he discovers that most people out there live on the surface of reality and not only they wouldnt dare take a dive underneath but wouldnt even consider there's something constantly eluding their awareness. Probably because their awareness is, hmm, defective?<BR>     <BR>     Donnie Darko, inspired by his visions ( or his deeper glimpse of reality) begins a personal trek of questioning, redifining and re-interpeting. The strange \\"Grandma of Death\\" (an old woman who years ago had written a book about time travel and spends her time ever since waiting for a \\"message\\" herself) becomes a focal point for Donnie. But Donnie tries also to squeeze as much information about the puzzle of reality from other people around him, most notably certain teachers, he attempts to piece things together and bond all these realities that appear before his eyes and mind together.<br />    The film is, as others have noted too, incredibly hard to classify. Viewers with a particular liking in the \\"alternative\\" will adore it as it encompasses loads of hints and direct references not only to time travel, but to parallel universes, telepathy and astral projection to mention but a few. But if the \\"paranormal\\" spooks you it has strong dosages of the \\"normal\\" reality most people experience too even if that is portrayed as a dull and depressing one. Which is yet another asset of the movie: it is as frank and honest as it gets.<br />   The young actor who plays Donnie Darko is utterly convincing allthough he has his show stolen by his mother who adds the necessary down-to-earthness to it all with her refreshing performance. But there is no actor involved in this film who goes unnoticed and I'd have to think hard to find a parallel in that respect.<BR>Lastly, this is an emotional rollercoaster of a film, it goes from scary to sad to funny and thought provoking to intimidating and back to melancholy in an stunningly effortless way (kudos to the script writer).<BR>   <BR>    An absolute must-see.
B0000640VO|5.0|Jean Pierre Jounet (City Of Lost Children) has directed and produced a superb French foreign film, one of the many that impressed audiences last year. Audrey Tautou portrays the selfless, vibrant heroine Amelie. Audrey Tautou somewhat resemebles Audrey Hepburn- her slim, girlish figure is perfectly toned, and the scenes in which she walks down the streets of Paris and in and out of cafes is very reminiscent of the late 50's actress. Jounet's film is an artistic arrangement of cinema and a small plotline. Many people have failed to truly see the magic of this film. It is not a &quot;chick flick&quot;, an &quot;artsy foreign film&quot; (although it can easily become that), it is a stunning film that's worth watching and enjoyed like an art museum.<br />Amelie is the only daughter of an aging father, working as a waitress at a Paris restaurant. She awakens to her powers and begins to charitably assist other people and bring happiness to their lives. She is no longer merely a human girl, but part sprite, and the magic surrealism in the film is a lot like a Bunuel movie or Salvador Dali painting. The score to the film can hardly be labeled minimalism, but at times the repetitive French accordion waltzes remind one of minimalism. It is highly entertaining music, perfectly atmospheric of romance and the elegance of Paris.<br />Personally, I was disappointed that during the Oscars last year, Amelie did not get the Best Foreign Film award (the award went to the Mexican film &quot;Y Tu Mama Tambien&quot;. Amelie rightly deserves recognition. It is a striking, beautiful film with a magnetic performance by Audrey Tautou, and cinematic magic by director Jean Pierre Jounet. If he comes up with more films like this, I will be sure to watch and perhaps this time around, audiences will be more appreciative.
0784011680|3.0|It's hard to cover a life like that of Charlie Chaplin's in a short period of time (even if that &quot;short&quot; period is two and a half hours). The problem is, Richard Attenborough's &quot;Chaplin&quot; tries to cover way too much, and in the process fails to give us much insight on Chaplin or his times. On DVD, the scene selection option is terribly wonderful because the film give different aspects of Chaplin's life seperate, sketchy vignettes. His wives and mistresses are in it for two minutes apiece, &quot;The Great Dictator,&quot; &quot;City Lights,&quot; and &quot;Modern Times&quot; each have only one scene, and if you blink you might miss the coverage of &quot;The Gold Rush.&quot;<BR>The film is entertaining in that it is briskly paced, and the performances are good. Robert Downey Jr. should have won an Oscar, and supporting performers, especially Geraldine Chaplin, Kevin Kline, James Woods, and Dan Aykroyd, are great. But one reason their performances are so good is because they are given no challenge. Chaplin is the only character in this movie who has more than two dimensions.<BR>The DVD fares better. Colours are good throughout, and there aren't any visual flaws worth noting. The menu interface is pretty neat. On the extras front, there are several documentaries that are essentially promos for the film. There are quite a few production notes, including some about Chaplin's films (which, appropriately, are as sketchy as the film itself.) Hidden on the disc are some fairly illuminating interviews with Downey, Anthony Hopkins, Attenborough, and others.
B00006879E|5.0|I received this CD from a friend of mine who I can always count on to find rare gems.  I was so surprised that me, a r&amp;b, hip-hop, sometimes pop listener would be feeling a band like this.  Their album is fantastic.  Wonderful mix of rock, pop, and a touch of funk.  This is the only CD that I have had in a while that I can play all the way through without skipping tracks.  Each track is worthy of being a single all it own.  My favorites keep changing.  It was at first 'This Love' because of its jumping, infectious beat, but 'Tangled' has got me whipped.  From the hard-core in-your-face 'Harder to Breath' to the romantic 'Will be loved'.  Definitely a band that is on the rise to super stardom.  Wouldn't be surprised to find their music on motion picture soundtracks all over the place because of the scene-setting mood that each song posesses.  I already heard one of their tracks on the TV show 'ER' and am waiting for more.  I have to say, I am now a fan and you will be too.

The comedy may go overboard sometimes but still it is good 60% of the time. It may be the worst movie of all the Trek movies but still the cast tried their hardest to make this look good.
0316168815|5.0|It's definitely one of my favorites. The slow pace of this book has allowed me to engage into the story far better than I would have in any other books.  The events/happenings are slow but definitely not boring. In a way, the style of this book reminds me a lot of Classic English literature, like Little Women or anything by Jane Austin. It's not a thriller, but great literature for sure. Like it's been said in one of the other reviews, if you don't enjoy the first few chapters, put down the book and don't waste any more time on it.

B00006FMDA|4.0|&quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is an enjoyably, lighthearted, featherweight comedy/musical, which was the first film from the Beatles. It has a certain charm and spontaneity that was never captured in any of the later Beatles films. The songs, while not their best, are pretty good (especially the title number), and it has one of the best opening credits I can think of.<BR>The two disc DVD shows the movie in good shape, with crisp, sharp, clear, widescreen black and white image. The sound, too, is as good as you could want. The disappointment comes from the second disc of extras. An entire second disc of extras is wasted on overlong interviews with everybody involved in the making of the film that you DON'T care about hearing from. Ooh, a talk with the son of the Beatles' tailor! I'M OVERJOYED! C'mon, couldn't the makers of this even spring for Ringo?
0684803356|5.0|\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" was the first Hemingway I ever read. I was a high school kid in the early 2000's, working on my campus newspaper, newly graduated from Jack London but not yet ready for Jack Kerouac. <br />To my young eyes, it was a good action story: Robert Jordan, the passionate American teacher joins a band of armed gypsies in the Spanish Civil War. He believes one man can make a difference. The whole novel covers just 68 hours, during which Jordan must find a way to blow up a key bridge behind enemy lines. In that short time, Jordan also falls in love with Maria, a beautiful Spanish woman who has been raped by enemy soldiers. The whole spectrum of literature was refracted through the prism of my youth: Good guys and bad guys, sex and blood, life and death. For me, just a boy, the journey from abstraction to clarity was only just beginning.<br />Re-reading \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" at 18 (roughly the age Hemingway was when he published it), I have lost my ability to see things clearly in black and white. My vision is blurred by irony, as I note that two enemies, the moral killer Anselmo and the sympathetic fascist Lieutenant Berrendo, utter the very same prayer. For the first time, I see that the book opens with Robert Jordan lying on the \\"pine-needled floor of the forest\\" and closes as he feels his heart pounding against the \\"pine needle floor of the forest\\"; Jordan ends as he begins, perhaps having never really moved. I certainly could never have seen at 16 how dying well might be more consequential than living well. And somehow the light has changed in the past 1 years, so that I now truly understand how the earth can move.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Loved Soundgarden and loved RATM.  Love both together even more.  One of the best CDs I've purchased in awhile.  Definitely worth checking out if you were a fan of either group.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I didnt see this movie in theaters but when it came out on dvd,  I bought it as soon as it came out and loved it.  I still love it.  I thought that it was better then spiderman, daredevil, and any other movie I have seen latly.  I cant wait for x2.  This time I wont miss out on seeing it in theaters.
0345448898|5.0|Lyra, the young heroine of this trilogy, snoops in a room she is not supposed to enter, and so learns of and foils a plot to murder Lord Asriel.  As a result, she is drawn into an epic battle between good and evil, in which many participants turn out not to be what at first they seem.  Lyra meets Will, a boy from another Earth, and together and separately they have a slew of marvelous adventures involving witches, armored polar bears, and alien species as well as many varieties of humans, both good and evil.    Pullman uses all four of the basic plots (rags to riches, boy meets girl, the little tailor, and the yellow brick road) with innumerable twists and surprises.  The young heroine and hero make the story appealing to younger teenage readers, but the story is good enough to appeal to even old geezers like me.    Buy them! Read them! Enjoy them! Read them to your children!    watziznaym@gmail.com
B00006JJ1O|5.0|For a poppish band, t.A.T.u. is a wonderful new sound in the music industry. They're a great new thing, and if no one has ever heard them sing it's a darned shame because these two girls have some of the most hypnotic voices I've ever heard. Their sound is uplifting, and have good meanings. Be who you are!
B00003CXXM|5.0|i love this movie. it is something i would call off the chain. the efects and every thing was off the chain. if u havent seen this movie then u should go and get it. i bet u would like it.
B00005LQ04|1.0|I purchased this film based on the great reviews I've read over the years about it, I should have rented it and saved myself the money.  This movie was horrible.  If this movie was supposed to be like a dream, it was right on target because much like a dream, this film made no sense at all. To say it was boring would be a gross understatement.  I'm a big fan of horror films, and I'm not to picky about quality or plot. Even by my standards, this isn't even worth watching.  If you want to watch an Argento film, [...].
B000002KBH|5.0|Firstly, the CD has probably my favorite song of all time, Candyman. It's just gorgeous. The words are not amazing like that of Ripple or Box of Rain, but the music...wow, wow, wow. i could listen to it for a long time.<BR>Truckin, till the Morning comes, Friend of the Devil, Box of Rain, Ripple...if this CD had a few more of my favorite Dead songs (St Stephen, Rosemary, Ship of Fools, here comes Sunshine, Terrapin station) it would be the ultimate Dead CD
B00008977N|5.0|Well, I´m a Peter Gabriel Fan since the Genesis era and I own POV and SWL in VHS, so the release of this extraordinary concert in DVD is a great new. Peter has always taken care of the production and details of CDs and  Videos so we can expect an outstanding DVD production in audio, video and extra material.<br />About the concert: The band is brilliant. The rhythm section conformed by Tony Levin  and Manu Katche is just astonishing. Tony is the best Bass/stick/upright bass player period !. Manu Katche is precise as always, David Rodes brings his pictorial guitar style that perfectly matches Gabriel music, Jean Claude Naimro is a very talented keyboard player, Paula Cole vocals are superb and Shankar, Levon Minassian, Papa Wemba and Molokai provides additional (and wonderful) colors and flavors to some songs.  To write something about Mr Gabriel would be redundant. He´s just the best. <br />I specially like the San Jacinto version (not included in the CD ), the stage concept that was developed by R. Lepage and Gabriel is brilliant. Pay attention to Tony Levin´s chapman stick performance in this song and in Secret World. <br />The only thing I would have added to the DVD edition is the Biko version and possibly the games without frontiers version of the tour (very good) instead of \\"kiss that frog\\". That would have make it a 7 stars DVD. <br />I can´t wait to receive the DVD.
B00003CX5P|3.0|George Lucas appears to be too many cooks in his own kitchen -- and none of them cordon bleu.  Case in point:  Natalie Portman has known how to act since her first appearance in The Professional, but in these inane action comics her talents are suffocated, nearly snuffed out, by Lucas' bizarre directing.  Lucas seriously needs to get in touch with his roots -- the first Star Wars, a comic but nothing like inane -- and stop tracking muddy concepts through his own legend.  Like Terry Gilliam, he can't be trusted with a director's cut.
B000001DQG|4.0|This album suffered from a number of problems, the biggest one of which is that when you keep releasing album after album that pushes the edge, what are you going to follow up with?  While many people were disappointed with this album because some of the songs are relatively lightweight, the core music here is solid, and there are a couple of gems.  Furthermore, this album was one of the few Elton did that was nominated for album of the year.<br /><br />Included in this re-release are four bonus songs, which I'll include in my review.<br /><br />The songs that are the least serious and closest to being throwaway songs are \\"Pinky\\", \\"Grimsby\\", and \\"Solar Prestige a Gammon\\".  Though there are chords that will seem familiar when compared to the music from \\"Captain Fantastic\\", these songs are not in the same league.<br /><br />\\"You're so Static\\" and \\"Bitch is Back\\" are fast-moving songs in the vein of \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fightin'\\" and \\"Your Sister Can't Dance\\" from \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\".  I have to throw \\"Pinball Wizard\\" in this group because it is a fast rocker too, even though it stands out because it was originally a Who song, performed by Elton in the movie \\"Tommy\\".<br /><br />\\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" is an Elton John standard, beautiful lyrics and music, every bit as good as anything Elton's ever done.<br /><br />There are two songs on here that I find personally satisfying, though neither is really pop.  I'm not sure where they fit, actually.  The first is \\"I've Seen the Saucers\\".  The subject is just what the title says; it's a slow mellow song about visitors from another planet.  I love science fiction, I love the song.  It's one of the rare songs with a science fiction flavor that is done well and at least semi-seriously, versus silly songs like \\"Purple People Eater\\".  The second song is \\"Ticking\\", which is incredibly moving and sad.  I like to play this song loud, and sink into the lyrics.  There is a story to this song that is in a category similar to \\"Danny Bailey\\" from \\"Yellow Brick Road\\".  You can almost see the story of this song as a headline.<br /><br />I also liked \\"Step into Christmas\\".  Some people may think it's silly, or unsatisfying, or whatever.  Fine.  I still like it.  There are few rock Christmas songs that are any good, and I personally enjoy this one.  Another one that I play loudly because I think it's good.<br /><br />There are a couple other songs that I missed, such as \\"Sick City\\" and \\"Cold Highway\\", which were B-sides to something.  These songs are fair.  Not Elton's best, but nice to have.<br /><br />While this album was not Elton's best, the production values were very high.  There are a number of songs that are very good.  Some songs are unique in the Elton John playbook.  You must have this album if you are a serious Elton John fan.  If you are a casual fan, buy his greatest hits and pass this one over.  However, before you pass this one by, I recommend you listen to a copy and decide for yourself whether you like the music.  I still rank this album as one of Elton's 10 best out of the dozens that he's done.llow Brick Road\\".  You can almost see the story of this song as a headline.

B00005JLO2|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this DVD immensely.  The movie needs to be watched without thinking about the previous versions or the book.  Do not watch it with a preconceived notion as to what the movie should or shouldn't be.  Take it for what it is.  A movie that has a heart felt story that is presented with superb acting.  <br />True there are holes in the story.  True, the ideas are not what we believe today (but most historical movies don't have the same values as we have today) But look past these ideas and just breath in the fine performances and the story.  Ledger proved to me he was a great actor.  Pay close attention to Ledger in the the scenes with Abuu in the prison, Jack in the desert and at the end, and Ethne in the church.  The whole story is told in his expressions and his eyes. <BR>  <BR>Buy this DVD and watch it, not once, but several times.  The first time watching Four Feathers was intense, but the more I watch it, the more I love it.  And also watch it with the director speaking - it gives a whole new light on the story.  And just as an added note -- my 11 year old son has watched this with me several times.  He not only gets the story and understands it but he asks to watch it.  He also has commented on the fact that he can't understand why people don't like Four Feathers.  Out of the mouths of children I suppose.
B000084T18|5.0|Thats right the hottest album in the streets is by my man \\"50 Cent - Get Rich OR Die Trying\\". Now some people think they know better than others about rap but their wrong. This is album cannot be compared to no other. The reason this album is blazing to Number 1 and staying their is because of such songs as \\"What Up Gangsta\\" in which he talks about how people fear him. Then the song that signifies what a true gangsta goes through \\"Many Men\\". This song is truely on top as one of the best rap songs i ever heard in my life because of the fact that 50 talks about not fearing death after being shot nine times and that if u bark at him he will definetely bark back at you. Then comes his soon to be next single \\"If I Cant\\". Then comes the latest Ja Rule Diss \\"Back Down\\" after that he got a song for the playas which is P.I.M.P. but wait he also got a song for the ladies 21 Questions which shows that ja and LL aint the only rappers that got love for the ladies. Believe this once u start listening from the first track your not gonna want to skip a track or go back and thats how good the album is. Also if you buy this CD you'll know why Ja was trying to stop EMINEM and Dre from signing 50 Cent.     G-UNIT
0812513495|3.0|OK - I read this one on the recommendation of a sci-fi/fantasy fanatic, which I am not.  I thought it was an OK read, but I found the violence really disturbing.  Normally that is something I can get past, but not this time.  I think sci-fi fans would love this novel for various reasons, but if that is not you, be careful.
B000065V3H|5.0|Sometimes you can watch too many dramas, too many horror movies, too many movies that are just too serious. When you want a movie that is fun, easy on the brain, and still funny, then this movie is it.<br />This movie is fable-lite, in that multiple morals are presented throughout the movie, but are somewhat camouflaged. Perhaps the biggest moral is that you should not be what you are not. Smaller, but no less important, morals might include knowing who your true friends are, friends stand by you when all others leave, love can not be purchased, and on and on.<br />With all the morals presented in this teen fable, you might wonder whether I was joking about this being a light movie; not at all. The fable is presented in such a laid-back fashion that you may not realize that this movie is a fable.<br />Patrick Dempsey is a classic nerd. He hangs out with his friends, equally nerdy, and plays cards (I am a nerd, I can say these things because I DID these things). Their idea of excitement is a new video game. Patrick loves astronomy. His friends generally believe academics in school are the most important thing they can do. Patrick has been mowing lawns nearly forever to buy a $1000 telescope.<br />On the day that Patrick goes to buy the telescope, he sees beautiful Amanda Peterson trying to buy a suede jacket that has red wine spilled on it, to keep her mother from finding she borrowed it after her mother specifically told her not to borrow it. In a moment of insanity, Patrick Dempsey offers to give Amanda Peterson $1000 to buy the jacket if she will \\"go out\\" with him for 30 days. Even though Amanda thinks Patrick is crazy to think that everyone will think he is cool if he goes out with her for 30 days, buying a replacement suede jacket is more important than being seen with Patrick for 30 days, so she takes the deal.<br />Of course, you realize that all this has to end up badly, but between the time that Amanda accepts the deal and the end of the movie, the viewer gets to see how shallow the difference is between geekdom and stardom, and how shallow the people are that determine which is which.<br />This movie has a few outright laughs, and a lot of smiles and chuckles. However, it is a feel-good movie. The story is compelling and unless you are not paying attention, the story will suck you in. You stay because you want to know the outcome, and the story line is sufficiently interesting to hold your interest to the very end. In the event you haven't seen this movie, the ending is poignant, and worth the wait.<br />This movie was one of the endless teen movies released in the 1980s. However, it has the distinction of being one of the funnier movies of the bunch. If you like light comedy, I strongly recommend this movie, even for young teens. While not award material, as entertainment this movie is excellent, and I give it five stars for being highly entertaining.ts to see how shallow the difference is between geekdom and stardom, and how shallow the people are that determine which is which.<br />This movie has a few outright laughs, and a lot of smiles and chuckles.

B00000K31Q|3.0|This movie was blah. It looked funnier on the trailer. I was disappointed in it, but then again, it was your typical teeny bopper movie. Why do I bother. The new kid in school, Cameron, likes this popular girl, Bianca, and wants to date her. She likes this other popular guy, Joey. Bianca can't date him until her sister, Cat, gets a date...a rule of their father. So Cameron and his buddy tell Joey to pay this other guy Patrick, to take out Cat. Meanwhile Cameron doesn't know Joey is taking out Bianaca. Is this a mess or what?  This is a twisted soap opera for teens.

B00003CXMG|3.0|This was a kind of fun little movie. Something to just sit back and relax to. It's about a boy who travels along with a rock band and their groupies. He writes about the band and relays the info back to a writer for a rock magazine. Meanwhile, he falls, slightly, for one of the groupies, Kate Hudson, while she is in love with the group's leader, Billy Crudup. It's a mixture of a comedy and a little romance.  Unfortunately, no oscar worthy performances were evident.
B000069AUI|4.0|i fall asleep to this CD every night, its so wonderful.  The words are inspirational, very catchy and imaginative.  But i also want to point out that the above review by &quot;dazwright&quot; was incorrect this isnt their sophmore album -- they had the album brothers and sisters also, and im not even sure if that is their first, but i just wanted to get that cleared up. THE ALBUM is rad, never have i heard someone sing and play with such passion as does chris martin, he's extremely talented and a great performer.  If you ever have the chance to see them live - do it.  They were wonderful and proved it in front of millions when they performed politiks at the grammys, wow was that moving or what? i would definitely recommend this CD if you are into talented, soothing, meaningful, creative, instrumentally spectacular music.  The only reason i didnt give this CD 5 stars is because i didnt just absolutely love &quot;the scientist&quot; and i believe they will top this CD with the next, if they stick to what they are doing now.

B000002BVN|5.0|This album takes alot of criticism for only having a few new tracks, but it is not supposed to be a new album!, it is simply a REMIX album and thats all Michael intended it to be! The album consists mostly of remixed versions of songs from the HIStory album. This is the perfect album to play at clubs and serves as a great party album. It features almost 80 minutes of music, and features some of the hottest remix tracks ever put out on an album. Michael also includes several new tracks. The title song &quot;Blood On The Dance Floor&quot; kicks the album off and is a KILLER dance track. The album's finest moment is the remix of the song &quot;HIStory&quot;. It has some of the best remixing ever put into a song. You have to hear it to belive it! This a must buy for any fan of dance music and any fan wanting to try something different from the KING OF POP!
B000084T18|3.0|Well, 50 is here. Those who have followeed his rise form mixtape mammoth to sudden rap superstar probably aren't suprised by his sudden fame. The guy has the flow(if not slow and mumbly, but what do suburban kids know about hip-hop anyway), the attitude, the charisma, and some help from Dre and Eminem. People thought his debut was gonna be another \\"Illmatic\\" or \\"Reasonable Doubt\\", but true hip-hop heads probably shook their heads. 50 is no where near their level and never will be, but 50 is the freshest, newest thing out so we all ate it up. What is to be said for his album. I like it. There are alot of tight beats and some banging tracks \\"In Da Club\\", \\"Poor Lil Rich\\", \\"IF I can't\\", \\"You like my Style\\" etc. The Ja Rule diss track \\"Back Down\\" is incredible, along with \\"Many Men\\" and \\"High all the time.\\" There is nothing groundbreaking here at all, but it is a solid album and that is good enough for me.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|My respect for Warner Brothers goes up another notch with the release of Mildred Pierce.  After leaving MGM, Joan Crawford found a new studio and greater respect for her talents over at W.B.  She also took home the Best Actress Oscar for this flick.  Crawford is Mildred, a struggling single mom who has to battle a cut-throat business partner, philandering boyfriend and ungrateful child in this classic film noir who done it. About the transfer: Warner has taken great pains to restore both the picture and sound elements and their attention to detail shows.  The visuals are glorious, sharp and in pristine condition. Close ups reveal actor's make up and fine detail in the fabric of their costumes - the transfer is that good!  Included on side two is a heartbreaking documentary about the star that perhaps reveals more than one side to &quot;Mommy Dearest&quot;.  Clearly Joan was not mother of the year but she was a marvelous actress and a great talent.  No one, not even daughter Christina, can deny Joan that!  This is a definite must have for anyone who loves Joan Crawford, black and white film noir or just movies in general.  Buy it today!
0679405666|4.0|Many consider William Makepeace Thackeray (1811-1863) a minor novelist who wrote in a time when George Eliot, Charles Dickens, and Anthony Trollope ruled the roost of British literature. Out of all of his works, \\"Vanity Fair\\" is the most recognizable in literary circles, although Stanley Kubrick immortalized Thackeray's \\"Barry Lyndon\\" in a film of the same name. \\"Vanity Fair\\" appeared in serial form in 1847-48, a process of publishing used to great success by Charles Dickens. The introduction to this Everyman's Library edition, written by Catherine Peters, says that the title of the book came from John Bunyan's \\"The Pilgrim's Progress,\\" an immensely popular work in circulation at the time.<br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" centers on the exploits of two British women, Rebecca Sharp and Amelia Sedley, beginning roughly at the time of the Battle of Waterloo and ending at some time in the 1830's. The two women are polar opposites: Becky is a conniving, domineering, sometimes insensate woman who constantly attempts to secure a position in high society. Amelia is a rather plain, simple girl who trusts people too often and ends up getting her heart stomped on repeatedly. The two women are ostensibly friends, spending their youth together at a finishing school and occasionally running into each other throughout their lives. Thackeray often likes to place the two in opposition to one another: when Amelia falls into a crisis, Becky is moving in the highest circles of society. When Amelia comes into luck, Becky's fortunes plummet. This see-sawing action helps move the novel through a series of intricately detailed scenes showing off Thackeray's sense of humor, his caustic critiques of English society, and his insightful commentary into the human condition.<br />Arrayed around these two figures is a veritable constellation of major and minor characters, all with their own foibles that Thackeray exposes in minute detail. There is Joseph Sedley, Amelia's obese and selfish brother who nearly marries Becky in the beginning of the book. George Osborne appears through part of the book as Amelia's fianc&eacute;e and eventual husband, a vain man with an eye for the ladies and a spendthrift attitude. George's friend William Dobbin also figures prominently in the story. Dobbin is an admirable man, marred by his inability to come to terms with the feelings he has for Amelia. Other characters appear and disappear rapidly, too many to outline here. It is sufficient to say that Thackeray does not worry about overburdening the reader with too many cast members, and with nearly 900 pages in the book, he definitely has the time to adequately describe numerous scenes and people.<br />I do not know much about literary tags, but I will say that Thackeray must certainly fall into the category of a realist writer. His goal with \\"Vanity Fair\\" was to write a story that went against the romantic hero/heroine novels of his day. The subtitle to this book, \\"A Novel Without a Hero,\\" clearly outlines the author's intentions to oppose unrealistic, feel good literature that failed to properly reflect genuine life. In this respect, Thackeray succeeds admirably by creating characters that exhibit both good and bad traits during their lives. For example, Becky steals and schemes her way through life but performs an amazingly beautiful service for Amelia at the end of the book. Does this make Becky a heroine? Hardly, as Becky does not change her ways after this event. Thackeray constantly sets us up to see a heroic act, only to dash our hopes a few pages later.<br />One of the most enjoyable aspects of the novel is Thackeray's acidulous wit. Everyone comes in for a drubbing here, from the aristocracy to the common man. Names often reflect the author's scorn: nobles carry such embarrassing monikers as Lord Binkie, Lady Bareacres, and Lord Steyne. Sharp is an effective name for Becky, exposing her character and incisive wit. \\"Vanity Fair\\" is full of backstabbing, lying, adultery, stealing,pride and general rowdiness, and no one is above these base behaviors.<br />A slight problem with the story concerns the numerous narrative digressions that wax philosophic about relationships, women and their roles in society, and bad behavior. These insertions do become taxing at times even though they often help move the story along. Thackeray wants to make sure you know what he is trying to accomplish; he wants you to see yourself and your friends and family in these character sketches.<br />A bigger problem for me concerned this particular edition of the story. There were no footnotes or endnotes in the Everyman's Library version to help explain the jargon or place names of Thackeray's England. While the author's use of language never approaches the level of Walter Scott's Scottish vernacular, to cite an extreme example, it is still a problem at times. I recommend picking up the Penguin Classics version of \\"Vanity Fair,\\" since Penguin editions usually employ explanatory notes.<br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is a long yet worthwhile read. The book is hardly unreadable, an unfair label often attached to this agreeable story.

B00005JJX8|3.0|John Robie (Cary Grant) has a big problem: no one will believe he is innocent of a string of jewel robberies on the French Riviera.  Grace Kelly plays Francie Stevens, an American tourist who doesn't know whether to kiss or kick John.  On thing's for certain: she's going to get to the bottom of things.  Hitchcock's outstanding chase flick is blessed with sharp dialogue, marvelous locations, stellar casting and a really solid screenplay.  Unfortunately, all are marred by a rather shoddy transfer from Paramount Home Video.  Though colors are rich, they are not well balanced and are sometimes extremely muddy. Contrast and shadow deliniation are rather low.  Digital and film grain intrude and distract.  At least the film is presented in its original VistaVision 1:85:1 aspect ratio.  Included are several featurettes, one on the film, another on Hitchcock and one on resident costume designer, Edith Head.  A stills gallery and theatrical trailers top out this offering.  Bottom line: The movie is worth its weight in gold.  The same can't be said for its digital transfer.
B00006LI4D|5.0|Recorded just a few short months before he left us last summer, Ray showed us (as he did many times over the years) one prime example of the great musician he was. No one can ever match or exceed the talent this legend possessed.<br />Every track on this CD is a gem, and the musicianship of Russell Malone (guitar) and Monty Alexander (piano) is impeccable. As a bonus, Telarc added another disc showcasing Ray's finest work from his other CDs.<br />This CD should be in every jazz lover's library!...
B000002HGD|5.0|I didn't like this at first, but now I find it great! It's really lighthearted and happy, foreign to what we're used to seeing on tv and radio. It has harder rock too. It's a surreal soundscape, a wonderful escape.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was surprised that Norah recieved the best album award at the Grammys over Rolling Stone. I felt that I needed to get the CD, to hear what all the fuss was about. I bought the CD, popped it in my car stereo, and immediately grooved to her sound. I had to finish listening to it in the house, and lit some incense while  I finished the CD. I brought it in to work so that I could share the wealth with my coworkers. It is a beautiful blend of jazz and country (the latter of which I am not a fan) and puts me in the mindset of Cassandra Wilson. Miss Jones has gained another supporter.
B00005JLXC|2.0|I guess I would rate this about 1.8, but I still feel I'm being generous. <BR>I'm a comics fan, not too into Daredevil, the new books are pretentious and empty and the film is much the same. It has some of the most atrocious editing I've ever seen. Every death is a joke, and then we're supposed to feel sorry for the lost character. Hell's Kitchen's roughest looking gang seems to be a group of 12 year-olds in the daylight, whoa, tough neighborhood! I think I heard some [...] chirping birds in there! Elektra is gone as soon as she's in the picture, she's the average girl, which is much more boring (but easier for the teen audience to identify with) than a silent assassin. Michael Duncan is barely in the film, hardly set up and the ending battle isn't even a battle. Bullseye is kind of funny, which was their intention. How is Affleck? Kind of passable, actually. He has his smirk and says heroic lines with an unnatural, soft, gruff voice but he doesn't do damage like the director, Mark Steven Johnson. I liked seeing Daredevil come home and spit out broken teeth. The film was shot in such complete darkness that you can't see most of the scenes with clarity. It is dark, but is so thematically chipper and goofy at the same time which detracts from whatever mood that might've had. Foggy Nelson, Matt's assistant was amusing with his alligator comments. Thankfully the cameo from everyone's favourite overrated idiot, Kevin Smith, did not detract from anything, in fact, his cameo had more personality than we got from Matt Murdoch in the entire running length of the film. This is only true to Frank Miller's story in that there are people who die, there is no Stick (Matt trains by punching bags and sliding down rails) and Elektra doesn't even exist like we know her. This is a short, empty film, and if I praise it, I feel like I'm contributing to lower standards. It's a very short kiddie flick, and it should not have been. It has a watered-down Matrix wannabe feel. At least Batmanand Robin was funny-bad, this is crushingly average-bad.
B00008HCCF|4.0|Having heard only a couple of Jones' songs on the radio, we decided to buy her CD, but found this August 2002 DVD to be cheaper! The 5.1 surround sound is great, and the concert is very relaxing. 16 songs, 67 minutes.
B000002J2F|5.0|Emotional, intelligent music that spans prog and pop music, transcending both. The band reached its pinnacle here. This is the best Genesis album, and a desert island disc. I wish Banks, Collins and Rutherford would regroup and give this sound new life, its so deserving of a wide audience.
0140177396|5.0|I'm a big fan of Steinbeck to begin with. This book does a superb job of characterization. In my mind the two main characters, George and Lennie have such great personalities and they are complete opposites but for the story line they compliment each other beautifully.  This is a piece of literature that really allows the reader to envision the characters and also shows the development of what it was like to live during this time period in America.
B000002I8D|4.0|Why someone as talented and as musically cool as Phil Collins would want to descend into Adult Contempory Hell is beyond me, but it's his career, and he's done really well with it.<br />There are some great songs on this, notably In The Air Tonight, which belongs in the top 10 of all time. If you say you don't like this song you're lying.
B00005JL3A|4.0|This was what I consider the best zombie flick modern man _will_ construct at this point in time.  I LOVE zombie movies!  As sad as it might seem to the \\"true believer\\" of the genera; the true Zombie Epic for us has yet to be born!  It waits to be conceived!  What does our existence say to the Age?  Will we survive the coming upheaval of the New, or will We, as expected, be consumed by the New?<br />Rage against the Inevitable!!!
B000055Y0X|5.0|The blackest of comedies that miraculously manages to not sacrifice satire for the sake of propaganda, and make even nuclear war funny. An absurdist's dream film that put Kubrick firmly on the map and gave much-deserved international recognition to Peter Sellers for his outstanding work in three separate roles.<br />The first time I saw this was in my college video library. Lots of old top-loading VCRs that seemed bigger than xerox machines, crummy, uncomfortable furniture, lousy headphones. And I was laughing hysterically (in a library, mind you) for nearly the entire film, right to the Vera Miles song at the end that accompanied stunning shots of actual atomic explosions.<br />One of the strengths of this film, unlike most from this era, is that it's Cold War-themed story does not seem outdated. Kubrick leaves most of the politics on the sidelines to focus on the absurdity, and to let the satire ring brilliantly.<br />Yes it's a left-leaning film, but it's also very damn funny and never self-rightous--it's much more intelligent than that. Kubrick's merciless portrayal of the military could be offensive to those who refuse to  understand what satire actually is.<br />But, if you really have a sense of humor about the madness of war and politics--regardless of what side of the divide you're on--I'm sure this will rank among your favorites. Guaranteed to replenish your vital bodily fluids...
B00003CXXM|5.0|This is one of the better movies to have come out in the past year. Not your stereotypical spy thriller, but has enough action to keep everyone happy. This film has more character driven plotlines, but that does not take away from the excitement of any of the action scenes. The DVD has good extra features, as we all have come to expect these days, including the obligatory music video (Moby - Extreme Ways). A good addition to any DVD collection.
B000089CJI|5.0|Yet another album that takes me back to when pop music lived up to it's name. Bubbly, fun, tongue in cheek electro-pop with vocals that also live up to the time frame they're emulating. Something sadly missing in our present state of 'american pop' (i.e. brittany and justin et al) are really good and unique vocalists.<BR>Thank you boys, you've brought a cheeky little grin to my face.
B00006LLNU|1.0|Just what is this suppose to be, music to get annoyed by?  This Cd has no redeeming quality wahtsoever.  Its like listening to a cat being tortured.  Pass it up at all costs!  You'll be glad you did.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|t.A.T.u.'s cd is really amazing.  These two girls have so much talent and their sound is so unique.  I recommend their cd to anyone who has a passion for music and to anyone who loves creativity and diversity.  These two girls have what it takes to stay in the music game for good!!
B00007H1Y2|5.0|Ry Cooder and Manuel Galban have produced an incredibly stimulating fusion record, nearly completely instrumental. Ry <BR>Cooder's name is a household name of quality guitar music, Cuban guitarist Manuel Galban proves to be most excellent, too.<BR>Each time I listen to this album, the cover illustration of this CD comes into my mind  -the rear part of a 5O's Cadillac, all metal and shining chrome-  because the record is mainly a guitar affair, with Ry and Manuel trading some of the hottest guitar licks you might be able to find on any CD at the moment.<BR>The melodies are traditional Cuban mambo/salsa/bolero stuff, but presented with a delicacy, a subtlety that make the record outstanding. On all the tracks, Ry and Manuel are supported by an excellent drums/conga rhythm section. Cuban and 50`s American influences are subtly mixed, but the album is -above all- a a very contemporary, state-of-the art-production and -almost certainly- a candidate for the next GRAMMY nominations.
B00006L83N|4.0|This is the third album I have bought of Symphony X, the other two were &quot;V&quot; and &quot;Essentials of Symphony&quot;. Like other reviewers have already said, I don't need to repeat how great this album is. <br />The only thing that I don't agree with some reviewers is to say that this album is superior than &quot;V&quot;. Although all of the album songs are great(my favorites: &quot;Incantations of the Apprentice and &quot;Inferno&quot;), I didn't find the &quot;hair standing in my arms&quot; effect that songs like &quot;Evolution&quot;, &quot;Absence of Light&quot; and &quot;A Fool's Paradise&quot; had in the &quot;V&quot; album. I felt that the &quot;V&quot; album combined better the dark musical effect Symphony X delivered with their explosive progressive style. However, I don't want to be misinterpreted, &quot;The Odyssey&quot; is definetively another Symphony X gem.
B00007K08H|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. At first, I was put off by the posters and commercials as I thought it would be very strange and stupid. I was plesantly surprised when I saw it finally on VHS. The characters are very likable and well developed. The filiming is beautiful, with rich colors, interesting special effects and animations and intersting characters throughout. It is a touching love story and story about a lonely girl who learns to take the risk of stepping outside of her imagination and into the real world.
B00002EPMF|4.0|A friend of mine told me that this CD was great and that I should hear it. I tried to hear some of the Death's albums before, but I couldn't stand them. Those Death's albums, every time I tried to listen to them, I always ended with a headache. So when my friend told me about Control Denid, I tell him that I would listen the album, but more like a favor than from curiosity.<br />After hearing the album a couple of times (this is an album the listener should hear a couple of times to catch the music flow), I reach the stunning conclusion of not only liking this album, also loving it. Eventhough the music is pretty similar to Death, the new singer gave this album a new feeling, a voice that was not only understandable (Death's albums lyrics could not be decipher unless you read them), but good for my ears. The complexity of the compositions (lyrical and musical) are outstanding, first class.<BR>If some power metal fans should hear this album (I'm a progreesive power metal fan), they should surprise themselves after hearing it. They would know that Control Denied is not a death metal album that sounds like the band Death, but a musical twist to death metal so that it could co-exist with a power metal singer. Ingenious!
B00003CXCW|5.0|A great great movie, at times whimsical, other times tragic.  Gloria Swanson was fantastic!  The commentary can be interesting at times, but during large sections the narrator merely recalls the plot.  However, I bought this movie not for the commentary, but for the memorable lines, the fantastic set and costume, and the outstanding performances of the actors.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I've been a Johnny Cash fan since 1956. &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; is his best work yet. This album reflects the deep character of the man himself. Johnny's 70 year old voice adds depth and meaning that could not have been there in his younger voice.<BR> The mix of songs describes the Total Man--all the way from his deep spiritual convictions to his love for June Carter Cash to his seemingly endless understanding of people from all walks of life, their behavior &amp; their emotions.<BR> If this is his last album, ( I hope not)he is closing out his career with his best work ever.<BR> Thank you Johnny Cash,for 50 yrs.of an unbelievable range of work &amp; inspiration. Most of all, &quot;Thanks for who you are-God Bless Johnny Cash.&quot;
0676973779|4.0|I felt this novel started out a bit light-hearted, an easy read that holds your attention right from the beginning.  It is humor-filled, informative and gives very definitive opinions without feeling preachy.  This is a well-spun yarn that keeps you thinking that maybe there is some factual basis for this fictional story.  The tone changes quite a bit during the shipwreck scene with very graphic descriptions that make an already active imagination go into overdrive.  It may not be a good idea to read that part of the book just before sleeping.  By the end of the novel, I just thought, &quot;Wow.&quot;  There's no other way to describe it.  It's a very riveting novel that reels you in from the get-go and it's almost impossible to put down until you're finished.  I really enjoyed it.  If you're looking for something to divert your mind from the mundane concerns of life, this is the book to pick up.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|...off the hinges!  Forget everything you know about wacko jacko today and focus on the great music. I love each and  every one of these songs. The bonus tracks are interesting, and &quot;Someone in the Dark&quot; from the ET Storybook is a beautiful cut. The incredible collaberation between Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney, Rod Temperton and Quincy Jones has made this album an american masterpiece!
1586210661|5.0|I have always heard my friends talk about David Sedaris, but since I am not a fan of reading, I never bothered to pick up one of his books.  However, recently on a business trip, I bought &quot;Me talk pretty one day&quot; and I tell you, it was such an enjoy and easy read that I recent purchased, the rest of his books to enjoy while I travel and at home!  Intelligent and hilarious!
B00005AAFS|5.0|I don't want to add to the fine comments of the previous reviewers. But I must say I am simply amazed at the power of their art, the clean clear and gentleness of melody and counter point. This is Rock and Roll not Bach Partitas, so shouldn't it be reckless and &quot;noice&quot;. On the contrary, After hearing their fine efforts on the Heartbreak CD, the progress to Mutter is simply amazing. Comparing the two, Mutter the more mature, more deliberate, more inventive and less &quot;in a hurry&quot; then Heartbreak.<BR>I most admire the base lines, classical string treatments and melody inventions. More so because I was raised on Rachmannoff, Lizst, Brahms, and Copeland. There is a classic sense in this Rammstein music. It will bear watching for many years.<BR>Also, pardon me for being 55 years old but I find many good things in their lyrics and style and listening to this &quot;...will not infect your soul and cause the country to lose the war&quot;. Quite the opposite... :)
0553213105|5.0|\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"  Thus begins the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen.  Written nearly two centuries ago, the novel still seems fresh and new owing to its radiance of wit and uncanny sense of candor.  The characters are quirky, at times satirical.  However, their actions and concerns mirror those of our own.  Should we value property, position and esteem over virtue and principle?  Should we forgo all romantic notions of love and marriage and instead be practical and settle for material wealth and security?  These are questions the characters in this novel ask themselves and each other.  It is a comedy of manners, but also, a story about young people trying to make rational and intelligent choices, pulled this way and that by their morals, their conscience, and often, their mothers.<br /> At the center of the story are Elizabeth Bennet, an intelligent and opinionated young woman, and Mr. Darcy, a proud, haughty gentleman.  They meet and almost immediately, dislike each other - Elizabeth because she finds Mr. Darcy incredibly proud and completely lacking in humor;  Mr Darcy because he thinks Elizabeth and her family are beneath his station in life.  But one cannot help who one loves, and Mr. Darcy eventually feels great admiration for her.  Elizabeth, on the other hand, realizes that she has been too quick to judge, and begins to look upon Mr. Darcy with some measure of interest.  What follows is a delicate waltz of flirtation and witty repartee.  We the readers, 21st century get-up-and-go, can't-stop-for-a-minute workaholics, then have the bucolic pleasure of bearing witness as to which will melt away first in the warmth of true affection - Mr. Darcy's pride, or Ms. Bennet's prejudice.
1590862813|4.0|My wife and I listened to this unabridged recording on a long drive, and both of us enjoyed it.<br />If your only exposure to Frankenstein is from the movies, this is a more adult horror/SF/morality tale.  First there is no \\"Doctor\\" Frankenstein, no Igor, no castle, no electicity, no robbed evil brain, and the brute reads Milton.  The \\"fiend\\" is sympathetic yet becomes truly wicked.  Victor Frankenstein is painted in shades of gray too, and he almost deserves what he gets - although the rest of his family doesn't.  The book starts and ends in the Arctic.  Sounds like the movies?
0060926317|5.0|Whether it is the truth or not, this book is a great story with many lessons in patience, tolerance, hope, love and inner peace. How can that be so wrong? Maybe the people who are so insulted by this book should read her second book. Mutant Message for Forever!
B00006G8HX|4.0|I'm a Trek fan, so I'm biased in favor of this film to begin with.  The strength of the old Trek films with the original cast was that they always developed the characters so that their circumstances were different at the end than they were at the beginning, unlike the Next Generation films, which come off essentially as bloated episodes of the TV series.  That is certainly the case with Star Trek III, which found an inventive way to return the popular character of Spock from the dead.  The story highlights the camaraderie of the crew more successfully than most.  <br />Final verdict--it's hokey fun, albeit with too many sound stages and a few examples of strikingly bad make-up work. First-time director Leonard Nimoy keeps things moving at a lively clip.
B000069I1H|3.0|Such a promising concept (as unoriginal as it may be) like this cannot be fully exercised in a 95 minute long movie. Had this movie been made a few years ago then it may have been a bit more original and 'in time' to be a part of the whole 'reality TV' boom.<br /><br />As it stands 'Showtime' is neither ironic nor exciting and you will forget it completely 5 minutes after watching it. If the movie were extended to a little over 2 hours, with tighter editing and a better script it may have worked. Nothing is fully explored or exploited in this film and the villain is so weak and pointless his role could easily have been played by a ghost.<br /><br />'Showtime' really ought to have been a mini-series. This would have offered a greater sense of self-referential, ironic humor and given more time to devote to plot, character, action and intelligence. But in this hour and a half movie, director Tom Dey cannot make anything work.<br /><br />Murphy isn't funny, DeNiro is sleepwalking and Russo is wasted. The only person contributing anything of worth is Shatner. And the references to his TJ Hooker show are ironic by accident in regards to Hooker being better than 'Showtime' and 'Showtime' within the movie.<br /><br />This movie is only an example of money thrown away and the totally wrong approach given to a promising concept. I would rent it. But make sure it is the widescreen version as the fullscreen (actually pan and scan, or 'CROPPED') has about %50 of the picture missing.<br /><br />The commentary is uninteresting and I must seriously point out that the advertised 'Uproarious additional scenes, including hilarious improvised Eddie Murphy' are anything but. Even if I had watched my own autopsy they probably still would be  the most uncomfortable and unfunny things I have ever witnessed in my life. The HBO documentary is light promotional fluff hosted by William Shatner and the extended scenes offer nothing new.<br /><br />Note<br /><br />The Amazon details are incorrect-There is no DTS sound with this DVD.
B0000640VM|5.0|Great disney movie!  Great songs by Billy Joel, Huey Lewis and The News and others.  Oliver, a homeless kitten, meets Dodger (voiced by Billy Joel)  and his gang.  Soon, Oliver is living on 5th Avenue living the life until he is &quot;rescued&quot; by Dodger and the others.
B00004XOWM|1.0|holy ...! I love this album.seriously, this cd really works for me! every time I play frisbee it never fails to keep in the air. God bless u soggy bizkit for once you did something useful!!! ummm.. would i listen to it? NONONON NO. but limpbizkit, my fine frisbee thanks you.
0066214122|4.0|I got this book for Christmas and I thought I would be polite and read it.  It wasn't like the usual books I read although it was packed full of technical information.  The book was an easy read that brought you ever deeper into the story.  <br />I happen to be a 40 year old programmer which is who the book is about only I am single.  The lead character isn't really a tech head because he came over from genetics and got into writting the agent technology.  It was pretty interesting how they described how they developed the nano technology.  It was pretty clever and I think that is the way that it will have to develop.<br />I thought the characters were well thought out.  I have met many character just like that at work on various projects.<br />I don't know if it was forshadowing or what when the author named a charater Bobby Limbeck.  It stuck in my head that name for a day or two until I remebered where I had heard it from.  That was the character that Raymond Shaw shot in the dream sequence of the Manchurian Canidate.  He was the guy everyone liked and they called him the mascot.  I guess that was suppose to explain why Bobby was always acting like a chicken. <br />I would like to see this one as a film because of thinking how they would create the swam and the action that happens in the magnet room. <br />I would recommend this to anyone with a technical background that enjoys a good mystery.
0440237688|5.0|This was a very, very good book.  While it's great for 5-6th graders, I wouldn't hesitate to use it with even high school age kids.  It's a very interesting commentary on human existence and what if we lived in a world with no choices, no decisions were ours to be made, a world of \\"sameness\\".  While the community in the book is perhaps at the extreme end of the spectrum it does in some ways parallel the lives that some live in other parts of world.  The book makes you appreciate the fact that you do have free choice and that your life is your own to do with as you like, albeit within the realm of the law. The book makes for an interesting discussion about communism, life, and the human condition.  It was a very powerful book and it really made you think.  I couldn't put it down!  I highly recommend this book to any teacher as a read-aloud with their classes or for any middle school/high school teacher as well.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I don't know much about this band.I first heard/saw them on an episode of HBOs REVERB.They were very strange,yet hauntingly beautiful like enya backed by current 93 and performing my bloody valentine covers or something.They're from Iceland and sound like it!Bowed guitars,dreamy keyboards,precise rhythm section,spooky and minimalist vocals providing soundscapes of a lost memory.Today is a cold,cloudy day and I'm thinking of the one I can never be with.This CD is the perfect soundtrack.
0345440900|5.0|We are first-time parents and neither of us had ever taken care of an infant prior to our daughter being born.  We had found and read a few books while I was pregnant, and it didn't seem as if it would be too difficult to take care of an infant.  Well, needless to say, our daughter was colicky and we made huge mistakes early on and didn't realize it until we read this book.  Now I have to say that when I read the first few chapters of this book, I found myself a little surprised.  Most books that I had read up until this point recommended a very unstructured view on parenting and Tracy advocates structure and consistency.  It was a little disconcerting at first, but I continued reading (thankfully).   This book saved our sanity, within a few days of trying some of these techniques, there was improvement and within a few weeks, our daughter was on a sleeping and eating schedule and was alot less fussy.  The book includes a listing of the basic causes for Colic, techniques to try, tables and charts to follow, problem solving techniques, etc.  If you have a colicky/fussy baby that doesn't eat or sleep on a regular schedule or cries for apparently no reason (at least none you can figure out) then this might be the book for you, I hope it works as well for you as it did for me.  I still wish I could afford to hire her to help me with my spirited child. :)
B000002J1U|5.0|I can't believe that this album was one of their least successful. It's so amazing, my all-time favorite. It starts out with the hard hitting &quot;The Immigrant Song&quot; then goes into the acoustic &quot;Friends&quot;. &quot;Celebration Day&quot; is a fun song that just sounds like a party. &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is a great blues tune, one of the first to show Jimmy Page's finesse with blues licks. &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; kicks in, and leaves you with no alternative than to listen to side 2, which begins with the rather comical, and bouncy tune &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;. &quot;Tangerine&quot; is my favorite song of all time, beautiful, well-structured, and easy to listen to, not to mention a good song to play along to. &quot;That's the Way&quot; is a sad but also quite beautiful song that leads into &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp&quot; which is possibly one of the most fun songs they've ever written, it just makes me wanna dance. &quot;Hats Off to Roy Harper&quot; is an enjoyable tune, though for some reason isn't among my favorites.<br />All in all, this album is a masterpice of rock, and one of the best albums in rock and roll history, surely worth a listen.
B000002WE9|5.0|Great album but cut up to much. Anyone at RCA listening...???
B00002E23E|5.0|I blame this movie for being what I am today. I played guitar for about 2 years when I first saw this movie. I had been a zep fan even longer, but not really as much as I could have been. Upon seeing this movie, I went into my room and sat down with the 10-disc box set of all their songs, and listened to it all the way through. More than half of those songs I had never heard. I liked them before, but after that, it was unmistakable, I knew at that moment, they were the greatest band I ever heard of, indeed, the greatest band ever. Now, I can play almost any Zep tune you could want to hear on my  guitar, and they have inspired me to play more than anything else. Now I play all the time. I write a lot of music now too. This is clearly the most inspirational thing I have ever seen. If I'm feeling a little down, or having trouble getting into a groove, I'll put this DVD on, and just let myself go, and then music will come out of me, it's an amazing thing. This is the greatest band doing what they do best. Highly recommended.
B000050IL0|5.0|I've seen this DVD many a time and each time something new pops out. While it increases my love for piano playing, it also brings me right back to reality when I see Gould' fingers doing its magic making me realize how far away many of us are from this masterful playing.<BR>Pure joy!
B007ELLDFO|5.0|This book is frequently assigned as class reading and often, the readers are quite young. I read this book as a young woman, then again as a middle aged woman, and now I'm pretty much what you'd call (sigh) a senior and I can sympathize with the issues that students have when they are assigned to read this book. A lot of how you interpret this novel has to do with how you have lived and how long you have lived.<br /><br />Miss Jean Brodie is a upper-crusty teacher of well-bred \\"gerrrrls\\" in an Edinburgh school. This not-beautiful and aging woman, someone who probably let love and life pass by her while she hid in the hermetic world of a Scottish public school had lived a life isolated from most of the hurly-burly (and delicious or painful experiences of Life.) Suddenly, and perhaps illogically, she declares that she is in Her Prime, which is to say she has gained power and experience and discernment, which trump the shallow gifts of youth, beauty and an untrammeled past. Or else, she's putting Cleopatra right down in her place, taking over as The Queen of Denial. Which point of view you choose to believe may have more to do with your own world view than with that of the author or of Miss Jean herself. And, it could very well be both points of view simultaneously--life can be ambiguous.<br /><br />Miss Brodie's sense of power, if it is truly power, originates from knowing her motivations, her strengths, her foibles and her desires. She acts on these instincts. Some of her power is maternal (though she is unmarried) and she nurtures the best of her girls, the \\"creme de la creme\\" as she calls them, as if they were her own daughters. She seizes opportunity for love, she rebels against anyone who tries to reign her in. But, does she over-reach herself or is she being unfairly treated as that most misunderstood of all creatures, a middle-aged, intelligent woman? Or is this a sudden awakening and regret that she has isolated herself from all life has to offer, and is she working off not only frustrated sexuality, but a desire to awaken it vicariously in her \\"gerrrllls\\" so they do not fall into the same trap that stifled her? That ambiguity, there it is AGAIN. And as we know from many other works of literature and history, women who seize power, whether she be Hatshepsut the female pharaoh, Cleopatra, Tzu-Hsi, Empress of China, or Catherine the Great are viewed with deep suspicion and even deemed evil by the mostly male dominated historical world.

If you have trouble identifying with Miss Jean Brodie because you are young but forced to read it for a school assignment, go back and read about women in history who have bumped up against the Establishment (such as the ones I mentioned, and there are many more) and see if something about Miss Jean Brodie's epic struggle for selfdom don't strike another chord for you. And if you are older, like myself, it can be painful and wonderful to see how a woman like Miss Brodie tries to triumph against her own choices and those choices that seemed right, but ended up with so much regret.orking off not only frustrated sexuality, but a desire to awaken it vicariously in her \\"gerrrllls\\" so they do not fall into the same trap that stifled her? That ambiguity, there it is AGAIN. And as we know from many other works of literature and history, women who seize power, whether she be Hatshepsut the female pharaoh, Cleopatra, Tzu-Hsi, Empress of China, or Catherine the Great are viewed with deep suspicion and even deemed evil by the mostly male dominated historical world.

0385484518|5.0|Old or young, male or female, bookworm or moviegoer, anyone can appreciate reading Tuesday's with Morrie. Mitch Albom tells the story about his time spent with a former college professor. Years after Mitch graduates from college, he catches an interview on television between Ted Kopel and his old professor, Morrie Schwartz, who taught a class called \\"The Meaning of Life.\\" <BR>After hearing that Morrie is sick and dying, Mitch attempts to reunite with him and finally runs into Morrie on the street. The two continue a class that ended years ago when Mitch and Morrie meet every Tuesday to have the last few lessons of \\"The Meaning of Life\\" class by discussing all aspects of life. Morrie allows Mitch to understand what really matters in the world and, more importantly, becomes a friend. Personally, I am not someone who can get into a book very easily; however, I found that after reading Tuesday's with Morrie, I was able to relate to what Morrie was speaking of. Rather than keeping the discussions to himself, Mitch allows Morrie to speak his wisdom to the entire world. Anyone who reads this book has the opportunity to take a look at life from a new perspective. I had the pleasure of hearing some of Morrie's wisdom when I read this book last year. Morrie is a magical human being who helps Mitch and every reader of this book to look at the world with brand new eyes. He turns everything that was blurry into something crystal-clear, something understandable. Whether one reads mystery, action, fantasy or non-fiction, Tuesday's with Morrie is a must-read book for everyone.

0671027387|4.0|Dan Brown prefaces \\"Deception Point\\" with a seemingly innocuous announcement: \\"All technologies described in this novel exist.\\" The novel proceeds with descriptions of a remarkable array of military technology, from airplanes that fly at three times the speed of sound to guns that manufacture their own ammunition from nearby supplies like snow or sand. If this mat&eacute;riel does exist, Brown has accomplished a remarkable feat of research in discovering it, and it's worth reading \\"Deception Point\\" just for the descriptions of it.<br />The novel's relentless pace and plot twists furnish another reason to recommend it. Other Amazon.com reviews have already touched on this point, so I will not explore it further in mine. In general, though, they make it possible to recommend \\"Deception Point\\" with enthusiasm.<br />\\"Deception Point\\" is not perfect. It's implausible in two respects that I want to mention here.<br />First, the characters perform feat after feat of extraordinary ingenuity, cheating death time and again. At points the novel becomes cartoon-like in this respect. But it's well-written and engaging enough that I think most readers will happily suspend disbelief, allowing themselves to be carried along as a vivid chain of events spools out.<br />Second, the plot of \\"Deception Point\\" relies on extensive American operations on, and removal of a priceless physical object from, Ellesmere Island in the high arctic. The novel treats Ellesmere Island as if it were U.S. territory, and as if U.S. government agencies could do what they want there unnoticed and without interference.<br />In reality, Ellesmere Island is part of Canada; it lies in the territory of Nunavut (itself formerly part of the Northwest Territories). The northernmost island in the high Canadian arctic, it has a Canadian military station (the outpost of Alert) and a tiny civilian community (Grise Fiord or Aujuittuq). (Ellesmere Island lies only about 14 miles (26 kilometers) from Greenland; thus, a little-known geographical fact is that Canada is about as close to Denmark as is New York City to suburban Connecticut!) So, contrary to the plot of \\"Deception Point,\\" it's unlikely that exploration of Ellesmere Island could proceed undetected and a priceless physical object removed from it without objection.<br />Notwithstanding the foregoing comments, I do recommend \\"Deception Point.\\" It's grippingly written.known geographical fact is that Canada is about as close to Denmark as is New York City to suburban Connecticut!)

B00000G3AZ|4.0|Emma is a wealthy and bored young woman in Regency England.  She lives the good life in her rural manse, where she lives with her hypochondriac father, and she has just successfully seen a match she's made lead to the altar.  Flushed with success, she is determined to continue her role as Cupid, which leads to disaster and comedy at every turn.<br /><br />Director McGrath proves to have a good eye for exterior shots and comedic elements.  The script is delightful, the cast superb, and Rachel Portman's score is faultless.  The real problem with this adaptation is dear Gwyneth.  Paltrow is absolutely lovely and charming as the heroine here, but she is not Emma as written by Jane Austen, and the discrepancy changes the story entirely.  To see this character played to perfection, you must see her played by Kate Beckinsale.  Before you click the &quot;No&quot; button, hear me out: watch both films' version of the pivotal scene of the picnic on Boxer Hill, where Emma insults poor chatty Miss Bates.  Austen's Emma is intelligent but thoughtless, generous but as yet unkind, in the way that young people can sometimes be.  The essential drama of Austen's story lies in Emma's realization that she has been mistaken about oh! so many things, in her growth as she internalizes that realization, and in her discovering love when she becomes worthy of it.  By contrast, Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect from the first scene.  She exudes sophistication; she cannot help it.  You never feel that she does not know what's what and who's who, and therefore she cannot develop as Austen means her to.  And that precludes her from playing Emma to perfection.  That said, if you are a Paltrow fan, you will love her in this charming film.  She is effervescent.  If, however, you are an Austen purist, then you MUST see the Beckinsale version instead.<br /><br />Regardless of your opinion of the film, you WILL be disappointed in this DVD.  Apparently Miramax's Harvey Weinstein has heard of neither bells nor whistles.  Special features listed are: a theatrical trailer, subtitles in English and chapter selection.  And that accurately sums it up.  There's really no excuse for such a trifling package.<br /><br />Now I've had my say and you, dear reader, may click away.whistles.

The story of her daddy and the unnamed cousin who raised her is extremely touching as is the section on her genteele, cautious romance with the owner of the local garage. Mma Ramotswe tackles mysteries short, complex, funny and frightening. She deals with deadly witch doctors, crocodiles, con men and womanizers all with the same cool head. <BR>I just loved her and this book.

0671042858|3.0|It's not that \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" is a bad book, it's just that it's not up to the standards of what this humble reviewer expects from Stephen King.<br />When a headstrong nine-year-old, Trisha McFarland, wanders away from her constantly bickering mother and brother while on a nature walk along the Appalachian Trail in Maine, she finds herself faced with one of childhood's greatest fears - that of being lost in the wilderness.  As Trisha attempts to reunite with her family, she actually ends up moving farther and farther away from them.  As day turns into night, she finally begins to realize that she will not quickly find her missing family and now instead, must be concerned with survival.<br />The rest of the book, of course, deals with this \\"struggle\\" and gives King an opportunity to delve into the mind of a \\"not-so-average\\" nine-year-old.  Trisha relies on her hero, Boston Red Sox closer, Tom Gordon, for inspiration as she fends for herself in the woods.  One of her biggest concerns is whether or not the batteries in her Walkman will hold out long enough for her to continue to turn in to the nightly Sox game before she is rescued.  She is as resilient as most of King's strong female leads and wise beyond her years.  Along the way, King introduces the \\"boogey-man\\" of this story which is a mysterious and unseen entity that leaves deep, deep slash marks in trees and various forest animals along the way.  This entity never quite exhibits the true terror that most of King's creepy characters demonstrate.<br />As the book lumbers along to it's expected climax, the reader will have an opportunity to enjoy King's style of prose.  The book is wonderfully written (as are all of King's works) with the usually memorable phrases and word pictures.  Don't let this review deter you from reading this book, just don't go into it with the typical expectations that one might have if they are a frequent reader of King's work.

0312305060|1.0|The modernization of Woolf's life in this book is a little too unrealistic and fabricated.  The novel is filled with too much modern day nonsense to be taken seriously.  The dark, moody, sombre tone of the book is depressing.  One feels as though they have taken a ride on the 'dark side' with Cunningham as the author.  Better to read a biography about Virginia Woolf!
B00006879E|5.0|The fool who said that this is just boy band [sound] shouldn't have titled himself a music lover.  Yes, Adam's voice has a distinct boy band quality, similiar to Justin Timberlake, in other words, he has a really good voice and sings in a high range.  Maroon 5 takes this awesome boyband voice and adds original funk guitar, perfectly syncopated rythms and an overall ambience that can't be beat.  This is one of the most full sounding, perfectly produced pop-funk-rock cd of the last 10 years.

Of course, you'll have to make that decision for yourself but i can almost guarentee that you'll be satisfyed with this c.d.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|\\"Requiem for a dream\\" has two separate stories, yet connected through family ties and drug-abuse.<br />The first story is about Sara (Ellen Burstyn, the same from \\"The exorcist\\", if you can believe it). Sara is a middle-aged woman, overweight, addicted to watching television. When she receives a phone call telling her she will be on some TV show, it's the moment of her life. She has a red dress that she hasn't worn in some time and she can't wear it again because of her weight problem. So, she sees a doctor that tells her to take some pills instead of taking meals. Soon she is addicted and obcessed to the pills, and her life goes down the drain.<br />The second story is about Sara's son, Harry (Jared Leto, from \\"My so-called life\\" and \\"Panic room\\"), his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely (before \\"A beautiful mind\\") and his friend played by Marlon Wayans. The lives of these three characters are already down the drain, because they're heroine addicts, and everything they do is in order to get more of the stuff.<br />All four mentioned actors have impressive performances. Ellen Burstyn's transformation during the film is amazing. Her performance won her nominations for both the Academy and Golden GLobe awards (and she lost to Julia Roberts, proving that what wins these prizes is lobbying, not acting). Jared Leto is also very good, but he doesn't change much from the introspective and  quiet characters he is used to play. Marlon Wayans surprised me doing a serious character, also very good. But Jennifer Connelly's performance, in my opinion, was the strongest. For once, she put aside her good looks and concentrated in doing a drug addict, sometimes ugly, desperate, puffy face, running nose, etc.<br />Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with the director, Aronofsky, saying he wanted to provide the viewers with an emotional roller-coaster. There is no roller coaster in the movie, it's all plainly downhill from beginning to end. I found  interesting some of the technics used by the director, like using mostly closed sets (specially towards the end), showing the prison-like life the characters were going into; and the camera attached to the actors' bodies, closing on their faces, was also different from what I'm used to watching in movies.<br />The title is perfect for this movie. What is the \\"Requiem for a dream\\"? It's when you look back through your life and you realise that it wasn't as close as what you'd wanted it to be, you only spent the chance you'd got for living.<br />Grade 9.0/10f the technics used by the director, like using mostly closed sets (specially towards the end), showing the prison-like life the characters were going into; and the camera attached to the actors' bodies, closing on their faces, was also different from what I'm used to watching in movies.<br />The title is perfect for this movie.

1573229725|5.0|Fingersmith is quite simply the best &amp; most enjoyable book I have ever read. It is the story of Susan &amp; Maud, two orphaned girls who live very different lives in Victorian England. However although they don't it, their fates are entwined beyond separation.<br />The story takes you from the depths of despair to the heights of happiness &amp; includes great tragedy, sadness &amp; also love. But it doesn't stop there as Sarah Waters takes you through virtually every emotion possible &amp; boy do you feel them. Too say anymore about the plot would be to destroy the immense enjoyment I experienced reading this book, for other people who are yet to read it. However I simply couldn't write this review &amp; not say that this book also has the greatest plot twists I believe ever written. You just don't see them coming &amp; they leave you astounded.<br />Sarah Waters is undoubtedly the best new author around &amp; this book should definitely have won the 2002 Booker Prize in Britain, for which it was nominated. She has the incredible talent of describing things, places or circumstances just enough, that your mind fills in the blanks &amp; makes you believe you are there eperiencing the story, not reading it. You can almost see the smog hanging overhead, hear the chiming of the clock or feel the chracters emotions in moments of sadness or fear.<br />I read this entire book (548 pages) in 5 days staying up till I almost fell asleep because you just can't put it down. I just had to know if a character was going to avoid a desperately horrible fate or was caught by one of the twists. I also agree with an earlier reviewer who said finishing this book isn't the end, it does affect you long after you've read it. Sarah Waters description is so good, that it gives you an idea of just how far families were willing to go in Victorian times to deal with their female relatives who they considered were ruined or had shamed them or had a mysteriously illness that they didn't understand, so it must be madness.<br />If you haven't read this book yet, get out there &amp; read it now, for I would have given it a 10 out of 5 if possible.
B00005JLSC|4.0|THE STORY: Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) wants to be a stage star, but she gets in the hands of a crook who promises to put her in a show, but he in fact only wants to go to bed with her. So she kills him and goes to jail; Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) already is a star, but she finds out her sister is having an affair with her husband. So she kills them and goes to jail; Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) is the publicity-addict shark-lawyer who only defends women and never lost a case, and he will defend them.<br />THE ACTORS: Renne Zellweger doesn't know how to sing; that's obvious; Richard Gere doesn't know how to sing either and he is obviously embarassed in some of the dancing scenes. Yet, they both star the best scene in the movie, the one where Renee is a puppet and Gere is the puppet-master. Catherine Zeta-Jones knows how to sing AND how to dance, and insisted on cutting her hair short to make plain that it was she, in fact, doing all the scenes, not a dancing stunt (on the other hand, in the tap-dancing scene I was not sure it was really Richard Gere doing the movements, because there isn't a take where he appears full-body and with his face turned to the camera). Praise for John C. Reilly and, specially, Queen Latifah, good and imposing supporting actors (funny as well).<br />THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAYS AND MOVIES: When you watch a play in a theater, you, uncousciously, KNOW that it's all a fantasy spectacle. It's a confined space. The actors are right there, in the stage, in front of you. The scenery changes. The actors move out of the stage and come back later. Even if it's the best play ever played, your mind is set to know it's all make-believe. That's why musicals are good when on stage. When you try to addapt a musical-play into a movie, all the magic is lost. There's no one in front of the viewers, there's only a still SCREEN. The space is bigger, there are no boundaries. The name of the movie is \\"Chicago\\", but it could as well be \\"Kansas City\\" or \\"Cleveland\\" or \\"Fort Lauderdale\\", because, apart from some thrown-in and sparse references to the name of the city, you often forget about it. As a comparison example, \\"Moulin rouge\\" was another movie-musical, but in it Baz Luhrman was able to create the whole ATMOSPHERE of a play, and in \\"Chicago\\" Rob Marshall couldn't; in the end \\"Chicago\\" was just, well, silly.<br />The \\"4 stars\\" I give \\"Chicago\\" is because I could see that all actors and crew members wanted so much to make this movie an unforgettable one. They couldn't, but maybe it was not their fault. Maybe I was on a bad day.<br />To sum it up, what I would like to say is that, when trying to make a musical, the director and script-writers have to be very careful. I would hate to see a wave of bad musicals making their way into the theaters just because it's an attempt to rediscover  lost ties with movie-history.<br />Grade 8.0/10eveland\\" or \\"Fort Lauderdale\\", because, apart from some thrown-in and sparse references to the name of the city, you often forget about it.

B000006045|5.0|Massive Attack has always been the standard-bearer of the somewhat specialized trip-hop genre.  this album feels like some kind of watershed moment in the evolution of trip-hop; Mezzanine exemplifies and then moves beyond its parent genre.<br />this is an album to own because everyone should own music that is just so spectacularly well made, regardless of what they think of trip-hop or electronic music in general.  Mezzanine manages to be both beautiful and challenging at the same time.  it's a rare achievement.  there are rare moments in music when genius is expressed with perfect clarity throughout an entire album, and this is one of those moments.<br />particular highlights: any of the songs featuring Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins, but most especially Teardrop (which also has a great music video, if you can track it down somewhere).  and track 4, Inertia Creeps... well, it's a song to put on when you're having an intimate moment with someone you love.  just trust me on this one.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Before watching \\"Daredevil\\", i didn't know much about it, except that he's a comics hero and that Ben Affleck (ugh!) was to play him.<br />I watched \\"Daredevil\\" because I'm a movie addict. I wasn't expecting much. And I didn't get much. It's an OK hero movie, with lots of action, fight scenes, the eternal battle between good vs. evil, a tender love sub-plot, etc.<br />There are some things that got my attention, though:<br />1) Ben Affleck wasn't that bad, but there are many other actors, more talented than him, that could provide for a better performance. But maybe I'm impartial on this point.<br />2) Jennifer Garner stablishes herself as the top actress on action performances. She's pretty, skilled, and seems very comfortable during the action scenes.<br />3) Michael Clarke Duncan and (specially) Colin Farrell, as the \\"bad guys\\", are very good. It's a pitty, though, that Bull's Eye (Colin Farrell) didn't get more time on screen, and his character wasn't more developed or explored.<br />4) There are some obvious jokes, lines and scenes during the movie, but the script writers apparently restrained themselves, so those jokes, lines and scenes don't happen too often.<br />5) Unlike \\"Spiderman\\" or \\"Superman\\" this is not a colorful comic-hero movie. In fact it's dark, played almost every time at night (when the Daredevil goes \\"hunting\\"), and one important characters dies. \\"Daredevil\\" 's tone is rather Batman-like (obviously, I'm talking about the Tim Burton-Michael Keaton Batman, not the trash-movie Joel Schumacher made us swallow), even with some gothic touches...

B00006JDVV|4.0|I really didn't think I was going to like this movie.  The whole story line sounded ridiculous and unbelievable to me but I wound up really enjoying this movie.  It was believable somewhat but the special effects were great and the whole look of the film was an apocolyptic masterpeice.<br />Matthem McC. (can't spell his name) was very good as the confident [tough guy] American who came to kick the dragons...but Christian Bale by far is the best thing this film had to offer.  He portrayed Quinn quite heroicly...a good guy you rooted for and wanted him to win and get the girl at the end which he does.  I would have liked to seen a bit more character development and especially relationships between the actors but there was enough to where you could understand the meaning.<br />It's an action flick with heroics and great special effects.  I recommend this film...it's much better than expected.
B00007KQA3|4.0|This is one of my favorities, I was fourteen in 1984 and read the book and was shocked and amazed at Orwell's vison.  When the film came out on VHS the next year I was blown away by the powerful visuals.  Also I really liked the Eurythmics score. Over the years this film  became one of the most watched in my collection.  <br />     About 7 years ago at Cinequest in San Jose I finnaly got a chance to see it on the big screen, as well as introduction and Q&amp;A by the director.  The print was good, and the discussion excellent but there was one thing missing: the Eurythmics soundtrack!  When I asked Mr. Radford about this he stated that this copy was his own personal print and they (Eurythmics) were late in submitting the score.  Watching the DVD I noticed the score was missing on the DVD as well.  A Tad dissapointed but this film is still fantastic if different (more a sense of quiet disperation) so get it but save that old VHS copy (was it ever released in LD?).
B0000797IO|4.0|I frequently experience the one-hour mark in a film as the threshold of disinterest. Something about the writing often loses coherence after an hour or so. The Good Girl firmly held my interest for just about that long. Jennifer Aniston, in particular, is so compelling at first that it is easy to become lost inside your wish to continue getting to know her indefinitely. She is a women full of longing and despair for whom everything is ceasing to matter. Suddenly there is another soul within her reach whom she fantasizes may share her sense of displacement and ennui. A boy, really, just on the verge of finding out that craving for drugs and alcohol is nothing compared to the extreme states desire for a women can produce. The two are each in their own way existentially adrift and trying their best to cope with the increasing sense of alienation they feel. Desire fulfilled is initially highly pleasurable for the lovers and they believe they are falling in love. But Justine is found out  (she is married) as they pursue an almost impossibly stupid liaison at a local hotel. This is the moment the narrative fails for me. All the tension so carefully cultivated to this critical juncture is dissipated in a flash. Action takes over. Too bad. I wish the director might have had the courage to explore more fully  what was happening between Justine  and Holden (her young partner in crime) as they explode out of their castings and give life to passion and a child. But what certainly rings true in The Good Girl is that in too many instances passion when ignited is fueled by the reality that someone is going to get fried for having wantonly entered into the territory of transgression. I think here of Damage (directed by Louis Malle) where the true price of transgression is calculated viscerally during every moment of that story. In The Good Girl a believable confrontation with the inevitability of doom is forsaken, sacrificed to contrived action with the need for a neat resolution stealing the subtle resonances, created during early story development, at every turn. John C. Reilly gives a self-less performance of great subtly as Aniston's cuckolded husband in The Good Girl. And Jake Gyllenhaal has moments of brilliance in his role as Aniston's lover. But primarily  it is Jennifer Aniston's work which carries the storyline and holds our attention throughout this effort. She is a good girl with a naughty streak.

As a young man nervously reciting poetry to Queen Elizabeth, or a modern woman raising a young daughter, she embraces the audience and pulls us fully into her world.  The settings, costumes and music serve to construct a world of changing ages spinning around a single soul in flux.<BR>Orlando is an astounding piece of cinema history and deserves a place of honor in any DVD library.
B00008OOZ9|5.0|There are things in life that we just don't want to see change because they're so damn good the way they are. They're comfort food for the soul. The White Stripes are such comfort food for me. Following up the massive breakout record White Blood Cells they've given us another fabulous record that bleeds classic White Stripes sound. . The title, Elephant, was chosen because the animal represents their personalities: regal, innocent, compassionate, and subtle. The musical rules are loosened a bit from the previous record's tight restrictions, but it's hardly anything new, even in the world of Jack and Meg White. IN the end it's still all about guitar and drums, indistinct relationships, and red and white outfits.<br />Jack's confidence as a songwriter really shows through.  It's as Jack has stated an album about the death of the sweethearts (note the dying country lovers the album cover depicts) and, for the most part, the songs center around the ways of love, relationships,  commitment and the rules that govern going about them. Nothing too new here, much like a lot of White Blood Cells lyric wise; personal with keeping enough hidden to still be mysterious.<br />The musical structure is quite familiar, but there's enough \\"new\\" elements to satisfy. They're quite comfortable with themselves and their musical formula and they should be because it works quite well. The first single and lead track \\"Seven Nation Army\\" kicks in with a false bass groove (guitar w/ pedal effect) and kicks the album to a charging start with the usual charging blues based riffs that have become Jack's trademark. The loud riffing continues on such songs as the building then bombastic \\"Hardest Button to Button\\", the crunching \\"Little Acorns\\", and the punk, could be hit single \\"Hypnotize\\". Then there's the softer side of Jack White with the acoustic, tender \\"You've Got Her in Your Pocket\\" and \\"Cold, Cold Night\\", which has Meg takes over on vocals.<br />The record just reminds me why the White Stripes are so much beyond just another garage revival band (not that the rest of the bands are without merit). Even with all the relationship rumors that float around the band and their personas they never pretend to be something they're not. Even with their simplistic musical styles they're still put out more a more interesting sound than the rest of the lot. The slow going evolution of Jack White's songwriting is certainly something to be excited about and I think they've yet to make their best record, but this one is pretty damn close if not.pes are so much beyond just another garage revival band (not that the rest of the bands are without merit).

0060537639|1.0|In the future, Mr. Menzies theses may prove to be correct.  Like many people, I find it intellectually stimulating to discover that I need to revise what I believe to be true.  All I gained from this book, though, is a feeling that I have been tempted with fine wine and ended up with a picture of a grape drawn with a crayon. <br />Mr. Menzies could have stopped the book at the introduction where he raises his questions as to the origin of the information contained on several seemingly authentic maps. Of the over 380 pages in this book, maybe 30 pages contain any useful information, and none of that is original discovery or insight from Mr. Menzies.  The rest is invention, supposition and endless extrapolation of questionable observations. <br />The maps mentioned in the introduction show that the author of the maps had a detailed knowledge of islands and continents that, according to popular belief, were as yet &quot;undiscovered&quot; at the time of the drawing of the maps.  Given that the maps are authentic, which Mr. Menzies does not help to establish, the sum of the evidence begs the question &quot;Who surveyed these 'undiscovered' places?&quot;.  <br />An account of his search to answer his own question could have been far more entertaining, and probably useful, than this rediculous book.  His book is far from being a scholarly, well documented, proven thesis: I hope that is determined to be a work of fiction and not history when being shelved in the world's libraries.<br />That the Chinese were adept sailors with a tremendous fleet in the early 1400's is undisputable.  Please buy and read the other reccomended books if you are interested in that subject. <br />That any ship caught in the tradewinds and currents of the earth's oceans would make landfall at the places where Mr. Menzies finds &quot;evidence&quot; of the supposed &quot;epic journeys&quot; of the Ming dynasty fleets, is almost painfully obvious.  The observations made by Mr. Menzies, though, do notprove that there was a systematic surveying of the world conducted by the Ming fleet between 1421 and 1423. Only that sailing ships will make landfall where the winds and currents meet land.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Menzies fails to provide any substantial, reviewable, evidence that the collective observations of Chinese or Chinese-like objects found around the world prove that there was a systematic survey.  Only that Chinese and East-Asian objects have been dispersed across the world. <br />What Mr. Menzies does do is provide a disorganized catalog of observations connected by almost absurd conclusions about the origin of every pre-Columbian map, ship-wreck, rock painting, structure, legend and tranplantation of plants and animals that he can infer, document or invent.<br />A well documented book about the orgin of the information on the pre-Columbus, pre-Magellan and pre-Cook maps would be a wonderful read.  This is not that book.
6301744136|4.0|A fun movie for thinkers, kids, and computer nerds.  Some profanity, but not enough to seriously damage the story line.  A robot who becomes &quot;alive&quot; courtesy of a bolt of lightning, makes you think about what it means to be &quot;alive.&quot;  Clearly defined &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot; makes it easy to see whom to root for.  Happy ending makes the wait worthwhile.  The sequel takes the story a lot farther, for more thinking, and more exciting fun.

630204135X|5.0|This is a truly outstanding film.  After viewing this film one is much more confused than before seeing it.  Of course, the interest in the film is to be able to say what it is about.<br />This is a truly philosophical film, especially existentialist in a Sartrean fashion, in which the self is in dialogue with itself.  It is difficult to say if there are two women in the film talking to each other, or just one woman talking to her own self (conscience).<br />I also think the film is about the inadequacy to conceptually represent that which happens at the consciousness level that can only be shown.  This is quite likely the reason we just cannot say what this film is about.<br />This film is a true work of art that will have that status for centuries to come.
B00000IQW0|2.0|Cheesy, soap-opera quality film meant to capitalize on the late-70's space craze is ok when there's action but really starts to drag when there's dialogue. The special effects are pretty good but the cast, with a couple of exceptions, is soap-opera quality at best. After reading that this film was pieced together from episodes of the TV series, the lack of a strong, clear narrative makes a little more sense. After a strong first half hour, it feels like this movie just sort of wanders around. It has a somewhat incoherent, pasted-together feel. But despite the film's weaknesses, there are worse ways to kill a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. If for no other reason, you should check out all the 1970's David Cassidy-style haircuts.
B000002KCC|4.0|Don't get me wrong; I will admit that this is probably Neil's best and most cohesive album.  Borrowed Tune, Albuquerque & New Mama are gorgeous. Speakin Out & Lookout Joe are slick as anything. I'm one of the biggest proponents of the raw, honest, real 'intrument'al sound. But at times this effort is just plain sloppy.  Maybe that's the point.  Either way, I know that Neil can sing better than this [Mellow My Mind & Roll Another], that fact is evidenced throughout this album.  And I know he's usually more of a perfectionist than to allow flaws like that of his spittle, lips or harmonica hitting the mic to be recorded on an album.<br />The problem with this album is that so many of these songs are pure gems, and the ones that could have been or come damn close to being brilliant are marred by distracting technical flaws.  Another take or two would not have detracted from the emotion of the song; the only thing it would have taken from this album is that nausea you get when you hear an artist you expect a certain amount of professionalism from flub a note because he's too f'd up to provide quality craftsmanship (yes, I do realize two of his friends just died).  Is that the point? I have no idea, but I know the CD I bought didn't say Sex Pistols on the cover.<br />If I sound a bit upset it's only because I recognize that this album could have possibly been the best ever pressed if not for those few flaws. But I have a feeling these things I call flaws may be the exact thing that makes this album so great through other peoples' ears.  Hopefully I'll catch on soon. I'd honestly love to listen to this album the whole way through, having lost that occasional grimace.
B000004CYT|5.0|Hogwood's complete set of B's symphonies easily bests the other four in our collection, which includes those by Bruno Walter/CSO, Karl Bohm/VSO, Herbert von Karajan/BPO (61-62) and Roger Norrington/LCP, plus individual recordings from a half a dozen others. Hogwood's AAM plays with energy, style and considerable skill. The recording engineers capture the rich individuality of each instrument and voice, and place them all perfectly in the gently reverberant acoustics of the two recording venues. Hogwood apparently drilled his team to perfection but directed the actual performances with a very light touch, in the authentic classical manner. No spoonsful of sugar here - expect brassy brass, bare wood on drum skins and real woodwinds. The punchy contrabasson solo in the finale of the 9th quite annoyed the cat, just as a live one would! We have the 1989 Decca/L'Oiseau-Lyre set, but this re-release should be every bit as good since the original recording was DDD. I don't know about Gardiner's set, but of all the ones I've heard this is easily the best. Highly recommended.
6302548195|5.0|Whenever I get bored with working out, I rent \\"Pumping Iron\\", the 1976 documentary that introduced the world to the sport of bodybuilding and its Grande Poo-bah Arnold Schwarzenegger.  I've seen this movie so many times that I really should buy it.  I mean, I've got the darn thing practically memorized!<br />Basically, the filmmakers shot footage of the competitors for the 1975 Mr. Universe (the amateur competition) and Mr. Olympia (the professional competition).  What you see is the dizzing highs, the debilitating lows, and the creamy middles!  You get an up close and personal look at the sport itself, its varying philosophies, and what it takes to be a champion.<BR>The filmmakers go from Gold's Gym in Venice, CA to Brooklyn, NY to the island of Sardinia off the Italian peninsula and finally to Pretoria, South Africa to give you the inside scoop!   ... <br />One thing the film does effectively is going in depth an analysing the personalities of the various athletes.  Amateur Mike Katz comes across as the most troubled bodybuilder.  Still haunted by the memories of being taunted by the other kids at school, he decided to hit the weights (and the horsepills) big time to \\"show them\\".  It's too bad they didn't film his high school reunion!  Can he overcome his demons and his Mr. Universe competitor Ken Waller?  Watch and see!<br />Lou Ferrigno is the most sympathetic bodybuilder.  He's a man who overcame his childhood deafness to be a top competitor (and, later, The Incredible Hulk) and he's blessed with an enormous physical presence.  However, his dad (a retired NY cop) has decided to take over his training for the Olympia.  Does father know best?  <br />Franco Colombo is also pretty cool.  He came to the United States from Italy with only his muscles and his dreams of glory.  ... <br />Last--and certainly not least--the most charismatic figure in this film is the defending Mr. Olympia champion, Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Arnold was far and away the best bodybuilder in the world in the 1970s, and his ruthless confidence--and wickedly sly sense of humor--makes him a treat to watch.  Arnold is ..., but he's incredibly charming.  It's easy to see why--with his attitude--he succeeded at bodybuilding and the movie business (and why he *may* succeed at politics if he so chooses).  It's truly a study of the mindset of a successful person.<br />Anyhoo, some of you girly-men may get grossed out by huge, greasy men in posing trunks flexing their massive muscles.  All I can say is that steroids were legal in 1975 and that bodybuilding then wasn't the drugged-out freak show that it is now.  I find \\"Pumping Iron\\" to be endlessly inspirational.  In fact, just thinking about it makes me want to train harder!  This is a must-buy for any individual who seriously exercises.
B000063DFN|5.0|Well, as a devout Maiden fan since 1984 (the year Powerslave was released), I am hard pressed to pick a \\"favorite\\" Maiden album.  However, if you held a gun to my head, I would probably have to say Powerslave.<BR>Sound-wise, Powerslave was the final step in a natural progression after Number of the Beast and Piece of Mind.  Musically, it is tight, aggressive and well-written from start to finish.  After PS, Maiden entered in a slightly different direction with a more synthesized Somewhere In Time (which is also an excellent album, don't get me wrong - just a little different sound)<BR>Powerslave, however, will always stands by itself in its own right for the great songs and tight, aggressive sound

B00006CXXU|5.0|OMG this is the best cd of all time!  I've been a Christina fan from the start and this cd made me love her even more!  I'm going to rate each song on a scale of 1-10 stars... 1 being the worst and 10 being the best!<br />Stripped Part One~ 10 stars~ This is a great opening to the cd, it's about her not caring what anyone thinks!  It's a cool song/interlude.<br />Can't Hold Us Down~ 9 stars~ This song features Lil' Kim and it sends a good message about not being sexist.  It's one of the best \\"dance\\" songs on the cd.<br />Walk Away~ 10 stars~  Awesome song!  It expresses her vocals and has really great lyrics.  It's a slow song and she belts out the song!<br />Fighter~ 9 stars~ I like this song a lot.  It's got an awesome beat.  The only reason I didn't give this song 10 stars is because at some parts it sounds like she's shouting.  Otherwise, it's great!<br />Primer Amor Interlude~ 10 stars~ This song/story is in spanish and it's about a minute long.  She's telling a story of her first love, it's a good touch to the cd.<br />Infatuation~ 10 stars~  This is the salsa song of the cd.  It's really cool song and it's good for dancing.  There are some spanish words in there and it adds a good spanish touch.<br />Loves Embrace Interlude~ 9 stars~ There's almost no lyrics in this song it's mostly nature but it sounds cool.<br />Loving Me For Me~ 10 stars~ This song is different then the rest on the cd, she doesn't belt out the song she sings it in a lighter voice wish sounds really great.<br />Impossible~ 10 stars~ Great song!  Alicia Keys accompanies Christina with the piano.  This song is sooo great!  It's got an awesome melody and Christina shows us her powerful voice!<br />Underappreciated~ 9 stars~ This song is great.  She's singing about how when you love someone and they are great to you but then they all of a sudden don't care for you.<br />Beautiful~ 10 stars~ BEST SONG ON THE CD!  I love this song so much.  It's really inspirational and the lyrics are great!  You'll fall in love with this song!  <br />Make Over~ 9 stars~ This song is sort of the \\"rock song\\" of the cd.  It's pretty good.<br />Cruz~ 10 stars~ Wonderful song.  It's a song about finding yourself.  It's really cool.<br />Soar~ 10 stars~ Song of Inspiration, telling you to persue your dreams in life!<br />Get Mine, Get Yours~ 10 stars~ Good Song.  It's actually kind of about having a love partner but not actually loving them, just to get their goodies if you know what i mean.<br />Dirrty~ 10 stars~ This is the best song to dance to on the cd.  It's really great.  It features Redman!<br />The Voice Within~ 10 stars~ This song has a great melody and the lyrics are wonderful!  I like it a lot.<br />Stripped Part Two~ 10 stars~ This finishes up Stripped Part One and I like it a lot, the background music is really cool!<br />I'm Okay~ 10 stars~ Wonderful song.  This song is about Christina's childhood and how her father was abusive and how her mother was her so great to her.  It was really hard for her to write and you can hear her crying in the song.  It's sad but really great.<br />Keep On Singing My Song~ 10 stars~ This song rocks!  It's saying that she's going to keep singing no matter what life throws at her and that she wont let little things bring her down.
B000089CKH|4.0|I suppose these guys are damned if they do, and damned if they don't.  Some folks will never forgive them for &quot;Popular&quot;, others will never forgive them for abandoning that style.<br />The truth of the matter is, this is a nice departure, and a nice new direction for Nada Surf.  The songs are melodic, sometimes moody, and the slower numbers work better than the rockers.  The production sometimes reminds me of a better rehearsed version of Big Star's &quot;3rd/Sister Lovers&quot;.  Though the lyrics are indeed a bit gloppy at times and could have used a few re-writes (but hey, so could all of Paul McCartney's last album's lyrics, too!), the inventive instrumentation and arrangements makes up for any lyrical shortcomings.<br />My first impressions made me want to keep listening to this album, which doesn't often happen with today's music.  Good for Nada Surf for sticking together despite public perception and indifference, and coming up with something new and fresh.  They're on the right track.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Personally I didn't understand all the critics to No Doubt for having released such a pop album like Rock Steady is.There's no harm in selling million records or trying to be a successful band;anyway Rock Steady is a very good album full of shiny and happy songs as Hey Baby and Making out or great dance as Hella Good.Underneath it all is a consideration about Gwen's relationship with her husband Gavin Rossdale ( what a lucky man!) and it's a very catchy song featuring Lady Saw;Running is a very tender song and Rock steady is jammin' a lot and makes you believe you are on a Caribbean beach.No Doubt is a great band and Gwen is an icon;she's an unbelievable performer and her stamina is contagious.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Two points:  first, while there are several previous cheap DVD releases of this title, they are all taken from widely inferior sources.  They are all rendered moot by what will probably stand as the definitive version of this title.  It's as close as we'll ever get to seeing this film as it was intended.<br />Second, this is NOT the Giorgio Moroder 80's rock soundtrack version.  Some might find this disappointing, but this version is more complete and better looking than Moroder's attempt.  If that's the only version of \\"Metropolis\\" that you know, still give this one a chance.  You may wind up liking it even better.

B00006ADG8|5.0|Billy Budd is a great film to use with students to explore the moral dilemma around Law & Justice. The film is well acted and it is a crime that it has not been released on DVD given all the other garbage that is released. This film is a true classic with a wonderful cast. I have been using it in a senior high school humanities class for about 10 years. Students find it engaging and thought provoking.
B00005JLH3|5.0|I am a college musician and I LOVED Drumline.  My only dislike of the movie was that, as a college wind player, I can honestly say that there is no way any band can have that kind of sound and move like all the bands appear to in the movie. The drumline itself is AWESOME! Finally, a movie that puts the halftime marching band show in the spotlight. I love the fact that they show the ammount of work and dedication that goes into performing a halftime show. Someone who has never experienced the marching band atmosphere might be confused and miss a lot of the humor in this movie, but I think that it does give the average person a glimpse into the heart of the marching band member. (and it just might explain some of us to them!)
0345409671|3.0|Okay, now don't get me wrong... I don't hate the book. If I hated it, then I would certainly give it below three stars! Anyway, all I have to say is that the novel started off pretty good... then Lestat met Memnoch, and that's when things started to take a turn for the worse... <BR>I don't know how Anne Rice expected me to remain immersed in the novel when some guy talked for about 300 or more pages about the Creation. And where the hell was Lestat? Why was he so whimpy? Why was Memnoch so boring? I mean, come on! Lestat loses his left eye, then goes crazy at the end of the novel and gets himself chained up! And the thought of a helpless Armand crying on his knees is enough to make me cry - I almost did cry when he exposed himself to the sun on the church steps... although beforehand I knew that he did not really die.<BR>Dora kind of annoyed me... I mean, she's Christian and she hates God? That doesn't make any sense... And who wants to know about her seeing her period? I couldn't help but cringe when Lestat licked the 'blood' off of her ... that was so disgusting!<BR>The only reason I gave this book three stars and not two was because I was being easy on it -- and, like I said, I did not hate it. (Plus,I'm in a good mood today!) And to tell you the truth, I love Lestat, but I'm kind of getting tired of seeing him, four novels in a row. He's kind of conceited... but I still love him! I can't wait to get 'The Vampire Armand', although Lestat is not the star of the novel. It's for the better. I don't want to get tired of him.<BR>And another thing that remains in my mind... I thought that Lestat would have a fair conversation with God as well, but it seems that God did not have much of a say. Yeah, yeah, they described him as merciless, but that was only Memnoch's point of view. What about God's?<BR>To conclude this review, I think that Anne Rice was just being too descriptive of the most insignificant things. I was just rushing through paragraphs, and sometimes through dialogues. Memnoch talks to much, damnit!
B00005JLXC|2.0|I really wanted this movie to be good.  Really.  However, it was quite possibly the worst I've ever seen in the comic booke genre.  The dialogue continually tried to be serious in tone, but sometimes was so badly written and delivered that half of the theatre was laughing in places that the director probably didn't intend.  The playground combat scene between Ben Affleck and Jennifer was a joke.  Colin Farrell and the KingPin were the only redeeming elements of the movie -- they did a great job in their roles.  Ben Affleck was terrible.  Even his superhero costume of red leather made him look more like the Catwoman than Daredevil. It's worth seeing if you really really love the superhero genre, but prepare to be disappointed.
B00006JDVV|2.0|A remarkably bad monster movie... I picked this up despite having heard it wasn't all that good, and while I enjoyed seeing the cool dragon special effects, I have to admit this film was kind of lame.  The plot, that human civilization is all but wiped out when the long-dormant dragon species comes out of its long hibernation, and must be saved by a deperate, straggling band of scrappy survivors, is explained to us in a series of painfully belabored, exposition-heavy monologues.  For some reason the action is set in the UK, even though no one in the film can even approximate a halfway decent English or Scottish accent, and big chunks of the plot simply make no sense.  (The dragons breed like flies, quickly taking over the world, and yet humans are able to triumph by killing off the single male of the species... These lizards never give birth to boys?  Plus... they eat the ashes produced by their fire?  Then why did they kill all the humans?)  Anyway, the single most irritating factor of the film is Matthew McConaughey's clumsy scenery chewing, as the bald-headed, cigar chomping American military jock who shows up to show the spunky Scots how to *really* deal with those pesky flying lizards.  His Robert Duvall wannabee act is a drag, and brings what little momentum the film has to a screeching halt.  The special effects are cool, but the film is a prime example of Hollywood gone wrong, another over-bloated project where someone thinks, \\"oh well, so maybe the movie has started to suck, but no one will care about the acting once they see the CGI...\\"  Well, here's news for you guys: we do care.  There's really no excuse to let a movie fall apart like this, and as a fan of dopey dragon films, I was sorely disappointed.
B00005JLXC|4.0|I do not know who was responsible for what in terms of the finished script of \\"Daredevil\\" between screenwriters Brian Helgeland and Mark Steven Johnson (who also directed), but somebody put some serious thought into how Matt Murdock functions in the real world.  Each night he sleeps in his own sensory deprivation tank and when it starts raining there is a magic time when he can see the face of the woman he loves (arguably the most beautiful scene ever seen in a comic book superhero movie).  But the former begs the question as to how Murdock and Daredevil function in the real world, and the later raises a whole bunch of questions regarding his radar sense (I mean, I am thinking it is basically CAT scan quality 24/7, right?).  This basically sets up the way I feel about the film: every step forward is counterbalanced by another step backwards.<br />We start with the beginning, when young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra) is hit by a canister of radioactive material, which blinds him but heightens the rest of his senses to super-human levels.  As is usually the case, fate intervenes and changes Matt's life so that he grows up to become both a lawyer and a superhero, not to mention Ben Affleck.  It is Matt who first meets the beautiful Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), who for reasons that are never really explained is about at good at martial arts as Daredevil, as they prove on a playground.  She is named for the daughter of Agamemnon in Greek mythology who sought vengeance for the death of her father, which turns out to be prophetic for her unfortunate father (Erick Avari).  He is murdered by the psychotic marksman Bullseye (Colin Farrell), but as often happens in these cases Elektra jumps to the conclusion it was Daredevil who did the deed.  Meanwhile, behind it all is the mysterious Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan), and Daredevil has the gauntlet he has to run through the remainder of the film.<br />What stops \\"Daredevil\\" from being a great film?  I would argue two things.  First, the fight sequences mostly take place at night.  Now, at one extreme we have \\"The Matrix\\" model will its ultra-slow motion approach to fight choreography.  Here we have the other extreme, moving really fast in the shadows and if you can connect the dots in your mind fast enough you might have a clue as to what is going on (I am old and my eyes are going, forgive me).  Second, Daredevil has three big fights in this film with Elektra, Bullseye, and the Kingpin, and the quality of those fights is in the reverse order of what they should be.  The best, baddest, biggest fight should come last and that is not what happens here.  If anything the fight with the Kingpin is rather anticlimactic, especially after the way DD dispatches Bullseye, but more importantly it is probably a fight that should be put off until a future movie (did Luke face down Darth Vader the first time out?).  Not being able to touch the Kingpin would have provided a great \\"to be continued\\" ending to the film and setting up the question of who will finally bring the crime boss down: Daredevil or Matt Murdock?<br />Obviously the idea here is to go with the Frank Miller conception of Daredevil, with the martial arts emphasis and the psychotic villains he fought rather than the original Stan Lee and Bill Everett version (Picking up Stan Lee's cameo in this film is a piece of cake, but see if you are good enough to pick up Frank Miller's).  At least Karen Page gets mentioned in the end credits, where you also want to pay attention to the name of the lab assistant played by comic book fan and sometime writer Kevin Smith (also catch the name of the opponent in Jack Murdock's final boxing match).  Which reminds me: DO NOT LEAVE THE THEATER DURING THE FINAL CREDITS; YOU SHOULD STICK AROUND OR YOU WILL MISS SOMETHING.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  Like last summer's \\"Spider-Man\\" movie, \\"Daredevil\\" has a healthy respect for the original comic books: the opening shot is lifted from a Frank Miller cover.The big opening for this film should mean a sequel down the road, giving Affleck a pair of franchises to take turns doing, and if director Mark Steven Johnson or his replacement continues to think through the character the way they started to in this film, this series can get a lot better.  I hope so, because when I cut back big time on the comic books I read \\"Daredevil\\" was one of the two Marvel titles I continued to read..

6303314015|5.0|I had the opportunity to see &quot;The Lion King-Touring&quot; in Atlanta, Georgia recently.  It was awesome!  In fact, I liked it so much, I went back a second time.  I had tried to see it once while in New York and was told it was sold out for three years.  If anyone reading this has never seen the Play, please do.
6305657939|4.0|This is the first movie EVER where I actually wanted to be in the shoes of one of the character's. Rene Russo is so cool in this movie. Ane Pierce...yum. It's action, romance with a touch of humor. And it's so smartly done. Watch it!
0452282152|5.0|Easy read. Sensitive story. Couldn't put the book down.
0312305060|5.0|This book is great. And what I love so much is that the movie is just as good. This book is moving, brilliantly worded and it changed my thoughts on everything around me. It was a fantastic read and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as well.
B00000BIBQ|4.0|As you probably know, &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot; was the first album-length rock opera, released about a year before The Who's &quot;Tommy&quot;. In listening to this somewhat-forgotten record, I had the impression that it was an inventive, interesting and even brilliant (at times) production, but the overall effect is a tad underwhelming. This may be why The Who's much more fully realized work is so much more popular. Maybe the most noticeable element of &quot;Sorrow&quot; is the frequent psychedelic touches - fuzzed-out guitar effects, sitars, backwards bits and altered vocals, many of which are used to good effect. And the band manages some strong melodies and effective lyrics as well, but the end impression is that of a good, solid album rather than a monolithic classic. Fans of 60s British rock should definitely hear this one. It's optional for the rest of humankind.
068485743X|4.0|I've struggled a long time with my writing, mostly because while I knew my storytelling techniques were working just fine, something in my prose was holding me back. I found the answers I was looking for in Lukeman's FIRST FIVE PAGES. <br />I also know as both a college English composition teacher and a reviewer, how awful so many writers are. Before my father died, he and I worked on some of his writing. I saw almost every error Lukemen talked about made in my father's works. Truthfully, if my dad's novels were typical of what crosses an agent's desk, then I can't say I'm surprised by the amount of rejection slips sent out. <br />I've worked with students who think their work is perfect as is, and I end up being the one who disabuses them of that notion. I wouldn't want to be the agent who has to disabuse many writers of their ability level. <br />But the most useful thing about THE FIRST FIVE PAGES is that it makes an excellent revision guide. He's not talking about the creation end of things. He's giving a checklist of things to review before sending out the novel. <br />I learned a lot from this book, and I'm busily incorporating that knowledge into my writing. <br />The only reason this book doesn't get five stars from me is the examples. Most of the examples he uses speak to the bottom end of unpublished writers, not the middle or top end, and as such, are less useful for good writers to find the subtle errors that keep them from the great level. Also, the published authors he does quote are not modern writers, and the styles have shifted enough to make what he use long out of date.<br />But he does know what he's talking about as an agent. I'd recommend listening.
B00005JLFC|5.0|Disappointed to learn this isn't yet available on DVD and i agree with the others in that it deserves to be - especially considering all the rubbish that is currently available!<br />Won the soundtrack to this movie from a radio station when I was 11 yrs old and fell in love with the tunes (always been a Babara Streisand fan anyway!).  Was delighted when the film was released in the UK shortly after and even at the age of 11 I thought it was fab - people in the movie theatre must've got really annoyed with me singing along I'm sure!!  Really romantic, always gives me a buzz and the emotion in the final song \\"Piece of Sky\\" is remarkable!!  Top entertainment, hope to be able to see it repeatedly on DVD soon!!
0792841344|5.0|I have always held a special place in my heart for this movie, call it simple respect for a well done low budget horror film.  It is always difficult to pull off a good film while managing a low budget.  The film works on many levels.  <br />The basic part where you can turn off your brian and watch the furious action of this movie build up and a bond develop between the two main characters.  <br />Or you can actually delve into the metaphysics of \\"The Tall Man\\".  <br />One question you must ask yourself is the Tall Man actually an alien from another planet?  Or is he simply the product of an overactive and emotionally bereft young man.  Or in other words is he just a figment of Mike's imagination?  <br />Is he a manifestation of something?  An all encompassing force like death from which there is no escape?<br />Or is the tall man simply a British actor named Angus Scrimm and there is no deeper meaning to the movie then that?  <br />You will have to decide for yourself.  I like to watch it from a different viewpoint each time.<br />I also liked the cast/director commentary unlike in most DVD commentaries they actually tell you things that a true fan would like to know.  The commentary is very good and very in-depth and manages to be done without the usual self congratulations and hour long pat on the back most directors and cast members feel is nessacary.  <br />This movie is great weather you are a stright out and out horror fan, looking for a good movie or just want to make fun of something.  It works on all levels that's what makes this movie so good.
B000069I1C|3.0|Showtime is a parody on one of the more beaten down genres in Movie Land, and Showtime represents ever cliché perfectly.  I don't know if it was on purpose or not, but the movie was extremely predictable.  But, I was able to look past that because of Murphy and De Niro's performances.<br />Eddie Murphy is always top notch in any movie he is in and so is De Niro.  Both are very funny, but not exactly pee your pants funny.  There were some very ingenious scenes, ones that I will remember for a while, especially the Hummer scene. However, the movie seemed that it took 30 minute breaks from comedy.  It was funny, and then it got serious, and then it got funny again.  That really turned me off because it creates a lack of pace.<br />Showtime was a good movie, don't get me wrong.  It kept me interested through out and the whole big brother is watching scenario was very intriguing.  I can definitely see some sort of show like this on television in the near future.  I'd watch.<br />If you're looking for a good movie with some laughs and you're not in the mood to think much, then you got yourself a winner here.  3 Stars
0800141326|5.0|I have honestly never seen another Godzilla movie, so it is a possibility that Gojira was underrated in this film. I however, very much enjoyed this movie and felt that Matthew Broderick had an excellent performance. The special effects were awesome, and the storyline superb.
B000071ZZI|5.0|Matt Damon has made countless good movies, and you can put The Bourne Identity into that mix.  This was one of the better spy movies that I have seen lately, and definitely ranks among the better movies of the year.  Damon proves that he can branch out and become a lead action hero and carry a movie without a lot of star power to accompany him.  Chris Cooper and Brian Cox were excellent, and so was Franka, but Damon stole the show.<br />The action scenes were brilliant and the directing was fantastic.  There was one scene that should have been cut, and I am not the only one to have mentioned it.  No person is going to use a body as a cushion and kill someone in the process of falling many flights of stairs.  But, besides that one scene, I have no complaints.<br />The Bourne Identity is a great movie that really captures your attention.  All I can ask is am I the only one that smells a 007 type of series appearing before our eyes?  Very worthy. 5 Stars
B000002KFJ|5.0|This has always been my fav. Sabbath cd. I like the mid period Sabbath better than the early Sabbath. I personally don't know if I can listen to Paranoid again. Great cd, but way overplayed much like Black 'n black and LZ 4. The writ is my favorite tune in this cd.
B00003CXSM|2.0|Im sorry, but no.  This movie was terrible.  There was nothing interesting about this movie.  Yes it was cute, but is that all Jenifer Lopez can do?  I don't know why anyone likes Jenifer Lopez.  Find a better script.
0446677450|1.0|This book is garbage, psycho babble. I am a financial planner, CFP, MBA. I had clients keep referring to this book, so I had to read it. Just garbage. Orman, Edelman, and now this guy. Slick psycho babble devoid of substance. Notice none of these guys have any education or substantial credentials. I feel sorry for people who waste their money on this stuff. Read &quot;Financial Planning for Dummies&quot; and &quot;The only investment guide you'll ever need&quot; by Tobias. Also, read &quot;the wealthy barber.&quot; Those are great book with substance. Tobias is a little glib, but I have never been able to find fault with his advice. <br />By the way, don't be too impressed by the CFP credential. Its amazingly easy to get. Look for MBA's with finance backgrounds and financial planning training. CFP's with English majors don't really understand finance.  <br />But be leary of this book. Its very thin on substantive advice.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This 2 disk DVD pack has 12 great episodes that you con watch over and over again every day, and i do. I love this show and it is totally worth buying.  Who needs HBO when you can buy all their DVD's?
B00005UKKF|2.0|Overall, Britney puts on a good show. However, compared to veterans like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Janet Jackson, she still has a lot to learn about performance and stage presence. There was also a lot of lag time and unnecesary sequences. It's okay, she has time......
6305531412|4.0|I have owned this movie 4 times.  I love the movie, but i was disapointed with the DVD.  It had no special features.  All you can do with it is watch the movie.  I'd go with the upgraded new DVD.
B00000FCBC|5.0|This was an amazing piece to work on.  I am a Metallica fan from way back and never could find a version of Garage Days Revisted.  It took me until this came out to find it.  And the most amazing part was I fell in love with the new disc of music!  Every song on here is classic.  Especially 'Tallica's take of BOC's Astronomy and Thin Lizzy's Whiskey in the Jar.  I don't know why anyone could find anything to complain about with this album and if they do I think they should find a life outside of judging what a rock band is doing.  This is fun between albums, as it says in the booklet.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I know that's what it brought me.
1569382603|5.0|I enjoyed watching and learning from these videos. Graham Hancock's views are in sharp contrast to what we find in history, anthropology and religious text.<br />He answered many questions that I was unable to formulate. Interesting is also how he links together findings and supports his theories with astrology and the anxient wisdoms.<br />Truly a challenging theory.
0767817664|5.0|Now this film is the best Vampire Film of all time. Take my word for it. This film is excellent. It's rich in the content of the actors, the script, the dialogue, the vampire effects. the special effects, Brad Fiedel's score, the music, the sets, the humour. This movie just doesn't get any better. This is the best movie of all time. Chris Sarandon was superb and super sexy as vampire Jerry Dandride. Wow and who could forget the nightclub scene with Jerry and Amy.Chris Sarandon is so HOT, words cannot describe, and for anyone that is hot for Chris as much as I, just check out his sex scene with Kim Delaney in 'The Temptress' and he'll blow your skirt up.
B00002ZMNV|3.0|I think the excellent production of this DVD is probably its strongest point. With the obvious exception of &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot;, the cameras (and the sound mix) do tend do overshadow the orchestra by showing the band too often. The band had no little or no input into the scores or arrangements and they seem to lack serious effort and motivation. The doco isn't nealry as good as the &quot;Year &amp; a half in the life of..&quot; docos; as unlike then, they are now used to the cameras and 'play' to them.  Despite what they say on the doco, im sure it would have been a much more emotional and important peformance and experience if they didn't mostly sit back and let Kamen setup everything. <BR>Take for example the brlilliant 1999 Deep Purple with the LSO. That performance was mostly written by John Lord (DP keys) INCLUDING of course the entire orchestral arrangement for the mighty masterpiece &quot;Concerto for group and orchestra&quot; as well as others. Now THIS is rock group/orchestra concert pairing that is.....exceptional!,  the concert blows S&amp;M away but the production is not as good. <BR>Another main complaint i have about this is the choice of songs, like on cunning stunts they like to forget most of their classic songs of old and try to promote their new stuff, this album is there best work since the black album, but thats not much too say.<BR>With all that said i still think their are some great moments on these discs, a highlight being the climactic transition between ktulu and puppets -still sends shivers doen my spine. As well as the end pieces. Get it if you still want a 'metallica' dvd as it mostly is.     <br />thanx for reading,<BR>Dylan
079284131X|4.0|This is one of my favourite horror films for life. Tom Holland did a superb job of creating this killer doll Charles Lee Ray affecionatly known as Chucky. This 1988 film is a classic, and should be watched over and over and over again as I have and will continue to do so. Performances by Chris Sarandon, Catherine Hicks, Brad Dourif and Alex Vincent are excellent.This is one of those movies where you know you've stumbbled onto something good. For anyone that looking for a film that is just damn brilliant and exciting and loves killer dolls then this is for you. The DVD could of been presented in a widescreen formatte, but it's a good print. <BR>I absolutly LOVE and ADORE Chris Sarandon and this is one of his best.
B0000009SG|5.0|Im sure the cd is pretty good, and my comments on this album would much reflect those views below (especially to get this one with Apostrophe -they used to be on a failed two-fer disc together). But when it comes to the artwork, WHATS THE DEAL??. It appears the front cover of the cd only shows about 1/50th of the amazing, intricate and TRIPPY artwork on the record?!?!. Pls correct me if the artwork is somewhere in the booklet or something but it really has to be seen. Anywayz, if u cant get the record get this, as it is a good induction into the world of Zappa, then definitly get apostrophe(*) and Sheik Yerbouti. Then consider delving deeper into the less accessible zappa.<br />thanx for reading<BR>Dylan

B000002MP2|5.0|About a year ago,the drummer in my band dropped a copy of Dookie in my hands with the message &quot;go and learn &quot;When I come Around&quot;.So I took the Cd home with me,and stuck it in the Cd player.Not bad I thought,there's some good stuff here.Then it nestled near the bottom of my CD pile for about ten months.Anyway,recently I was bored so I stuck on the album.And then it hit me.If a better punk CD was ever released then I would have to go and buy it.Looks like I'll be saving my cash then.Although &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; by Blink 182 is also a fantastic album,It pales next to &quot;Dookie&quot;.I can only count one bad song which is the secret track at the end.Every song is outstanding in every way,apart from &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;.This because &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; is damn well the finest song on the album,in Greenday's history and pretty much one of the best punk songs of all time.This spits on &quot;new&quot; punk from the top of a very,very tall tower,and,although Blink 182 are a great band, they released the 3-star rated &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; in 1995,a whole year after this.Still standing strong at almost NINE years old,Dookie is absolutley essential.There is nothing more to it.
B00007G207|5.0|&quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; as released over a dozen years ago in American theatres (and on VHS), and &quot;Cinema Paradiso -- The New Version&quot; on DVD, are very different movies, in my opinion.  Fortunately both are included on the new DVD, so it's a great contribution to anyone's DVD library.<br />I'm among those who feel the original was better, and so I urge you to watch the American theatrical release first.  That's the one that got the Oscar.  And that's the better work of art, IMHO.  Nevertheless, the New Version will be irresistable to those who love the original, even though it may burst a few bubbles wisely left intact in the 1990 release.
0345409671|4.0|It took me a while to get around to reading this one, but I finally did, especially since finding it too intriguing to ignore. It was rather noble of Anne Rice to delve into the old God vs. Devil thing, instead of just good vs. evil, which is what most horror writers do. Others seem to steer clear of stories involving religion as a general rule of thumb.<br />Although I thought her theory of the banished angel, Memnoch (or Satan to some of us), was interesting, I also found it to be somewhat different than my own thoughts on the same topic. That's alright, of course; it is Lestat's world we're talking about here, not mine. She sure knows how to bend an old topic to its maximum twist to tell a story though. Her devil was not only a thoughtful and caring angel, but defiant and questioning of a God that he felt was thoughtless and negligent toward the needs of the earth's disadvantaged, its lost souls as well. Could this be the way it really is? I hope not, as many of us won't last a second, trying to get into a heaven led by such a deity. And other than the fact that Lestat is a vampire, and in need of human blood to survive, the idea of him being sinister enough to be picked as the devil's right hand man was perplexing enough in itself ... in a way. I had to remind myself every now and then that it was a thoughtful king of Hell who found himself in need of the services of a somewhat thoughtful bloodsucker.<br />Although Lestat needed human blood merely to subsist, he would never take it from the beautiful Dora though, for he loved her so, and promised her father, whom he did kill, that he would watch over her. But eventually, superfluous sips of insignificance proved tasty enough anyway ... well, read it and see for yourself.<br />Anne Rice has a deliciously twisted and wicked mind for expressing stories of the blood-leeching monster of legend and folklore in a contemporary setting. It seems her scenarios are endless, but always very new and exhilarating. I love the way she thinks, and find her to be an extremely amazing writer. I found this book to be very interesting indeed.he way she thinks, and find her to be an extremely amazing writer. I found this book to be very interesting indeed.
B0000033IS|5.0|The magnitude of Aretha's voice and the depth of her emotions are displayed in every song.  She shared with Sam Cooke the obvious trials of being Black, especially during this time period, and she more than reiterated his thoughts with &quot;A Change is Gonna Come.&quot;  Her love drama is spelled out to us in &quot;Baby, baby, baby&quot; and &quot;Do Right Woman/Man.&quot;  For you Blues lovers, there is the down and dirty &quot;Dr. Feelgood.&quot;  No matter how you look at it, this CD is a great buy!
0062502182|4.0|Yes, much of what negative reviewers of this book have to say is true:  the writing is blunt and simple, the characters lack depth and complexity, it is quite male-focused in its subject matter and language, it has a bunch of quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo, and so on.  This book should not be put on the list of great literature for the ages.  There are doubtless many novels that cover subject matter from this book far more artfully.  As I read the book, I was aware of its hokeyness and lack of redeeming literary qualities.  I am, in fact, usually the first person to criticize books that read like this.<br />And yet, I have to say - and I feel a bit sheepish about this - that I found it meaningful, even profound at times.  How can I say this, given my criticisms? First of all, unlike many reviewers, I did not approach this book with great expectations.  No one told me that this was Shakespeare or Tolstoy; I had never even heard of it until it was recommended to me recently.  And by the end of page 2, I had adjusted my expectations further.  This clearly was not going to be winning the Booker prize.<br />But I found the book moving in its simple way.  The characters deliver their statements without subtlety, but subtlety is more a literary virtue than a philosophical one.  In fact, I essentially came to view this work as a life philosophy expressed as a fable, so I didn't particularly mind that its messages were not buried far beneath the surface.<br />Are those messages novel? No, but what of it? Novelists have been recycling themes for centuries, becuase many themes are of enduring interest and relevance. The point is, the messages are worthwhile and deserving of consideration.  They are simple, but I think that simplicity is itself one of the central themes of the book:  that life is not that complicated when one follows one's dreams honestly and passionately, or as the book says, \\"with love and purpose.\\"  And yet the book reminds us that it is very easy to give up dreams and abandon one's passion.<br />I have to disagree with one often-mentioned criticism of the book, namely, that it advocates pure materialism.  That is, in my opinion, a serious misinterpretation.  The book is written in the style of a fable, and therefore the goals people strive for are the typical gold-and-buried-treasure stuff.  But I think one would have to misread the book quite severely to think that it is advocating material gain.  The book is not at all about the specific goals that the protagonist pursues.  It is about the importance of wanting something urgently and how the wanting seems to reorient the universe in harmony with that goal (just as a magnetic field can reorder the particles around it), how genuine passion and enthusiasm are rewarded with success, how those who love us encourage us to pursue our goals, and how the act of reaching for goals - whatever they are, and whether or not ultimately reached - plunges us into a strong current that carries us to places that we can never expect or know when we embark.  There is something here in common with the beliefs of the Romantics, in that much of the value of the goal is in the journey that it leads us on -- the experiences gained and the lessons learned.<br />It's not a fair criticism of the book, I think, to say that it doesn't tell us what happens when people's goals conflict with one another, or disclose that circumstances outside of our control often render us unable to reach our goals however sincerely we may pursue them.  We don't need a book to tell us that.  Anyone who has made it out of childhood knows that, and I have to believe that the author is well aware of this as well.  I suspect that through his simple tale, he is trying to provide some kind of argument against the kind of cynicism or fear that the world can sometimes instill in us, and encourage us to keep diving into that &quot;strong current&quot; to see where it takes us.
B00005RHGK|1.0|The first 25 minutes of the movie made me turn on the lights of my living room, just to be sure the sounds i heard from the surround speakers came from the movie and not from a mad killer lurking  in my garden.<br />The movie starts with a very nerve breaking car chase and continues with a very eery basement scene. The killers truck has to be one of the scariest images i have ever seen!<br />The rest of the movie is transformed into a very bad c-class tv movie with unbelievably bad acting, the dummest dialogues in the world and an ending that really makes you glad it has finished...<br />It had great potential but was a disaster. Avoid at all costs.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I have just recently started listening to T.A.T.U, and I think that they are a band that America has been waiting for for a long time. I personally, as a choir student, think that their voices are the purest and most beautiful voices I have ever heard. Many people from Russia say that their Russian version of \\"All the Things She said' sounds so much better than the American version,  so I listened to it, and looked up the lyrics and I think that both are really great songs. <BR>They show that they don't care what people say about them. In the song \\"All the things she said\\" it talks about how they don't care what everyone thinks about their relationship, and on MTV Lena says \\"Every song is about our life, Everyone thinks we are lesbians. But we just love eachother.\\" Believe what you want to believe, or what people are saying. Tatu is a huge inspiration for me, and a lot of others. I think their C.D. 200KM/hr in the wrong lane is a great c.d. I have yet to perchase the cd, but i have listened to 'All the things she said' one million times, including all the other songs on the cd...TATU RULZ!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|well it seems the last few reviews have got mixed up in whether Avril Lavigne is a punk or a donkey but I hope my review is more about the album than Avril.<BR>     This album is a sensational piece of work, it is vey simple yet amazing to listen to. I can honestly say that there is no really bad songs on this album and all are worth a listen to. If you liked Avril's to date single releases you will love the album, and to convince you even more &quot;complicated and &quot;sk8er boi&quot; are not the best tracks, &quot;I'm with you&quot;,&quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Anything but ordinary&quot; are all exceptional tracks. The lyrics are fantastically written and done so with a lot of passion and creativity. As for Avril's voice, she aint no Celine Dion but then again she aint no Geri Halliwell. The album is already been No 1 in America and she has had 3 consecitive No1 single releases in America. So if you are thinking about buying it, I would deffinately reccomend do do so.
B000002JB3|5.0|I originally listened to this CD because of the song &quot;Lorenzo,&quot; after learning it was written about Lorenzo Odone, the young boy with ALD whose courageous parents took on the medical establishment and pursued their own discovery process of a treatment for their son, as chronicled in the 1992 film &quot;Lorenzo's Oil&quot; starring Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte.  I am a high school English teacher, wanting to use the film in conjunction with an essay project on how ordinary people can demonstrate immense courage in the face of defeatist attitudes and what seem to be impossible odds -- so I was looking on the net for information associated with the film, and discovered this link to Phil Collins and the song, inspired by Michaela Odone's poetry about Lorenzo.   <br />The album's title fits in so many ways with the process of moving &quot;into the light&quot; that Lorenzo's parents achieved for him. The uplifting rhythms and spiritual orientation of many of the album's lyrics make it a favorite of mine when I'm working in the garden, cooking, or dancing with my 9 year-old daughter.  <BR>I suspect Phil Collins responded to the story of Lorenzo as many of us have -- with such unending gratitude for the ability to dance, and do so many other things that sufferers of illness can no longer do -- and with a sense of awe at the relentless love and perseverence of the Odone's to insist on &quot;The Light&quot; for their son no matter the cost to themselves.<br />The multicultural influences on rhythm and melodic structures add to a sense of how both joy and sadness combine in simplicity at the most poignant moments on the album -- as they do in life.<BR>If you want an album that will uplift and inspire you in both its music and its intentions, this is a perfect choice.

Such as in Losing Grip. <br />  All in all, I think let Go was worth it all, and I greatly enjoy listening to her album. Avril has some flaws here and there, but she's overall pretty amazing.s safe to say that MTV and record labels have no conern whatsoever about the history and tradition of music. They are just in it for the money. Punk rock (and im not even a fan of it) is not just about clothes, it's about expression of oneself's individuality. You want to hear true punk rock? Listen to the Sex Pistols, or the Clash. You may not like them, they dont have the 'cute' ties and everything that make Avril Lavigne sooooo cooool. But they're true punk rock.<BR>                 But the powers-have-be have mutilated it, disfigured it, watered it down to suit mainstream radio, and as a result, they still posess their mansions, and cars.<BR>                 Avril Lavigne's attitude doesn't excactly endear herself to me either. She's unnessecarily brash, and cocky. She claims to not care what other people think about her, but the songs on her album prove otherwise.<BR>                 Guitar-driven rock? My stinky ass. It's the same moldy pop-punk trash that she criticizes Britney Spears for putting out. And she's a songwriting virtuso?? Even is she DID write these songs by herself, it's no great achievement. My half witted dalmation could write these in the tiolet. But she didnt write these by herself, just look at the credits on her CD. If at all she did something, it was to add her half-brained whiny \\"look at me, im so tortured\\" lyrics, which in the end made the songs worse. <BR>                This CD stinks, and is a tragic reminder of what music has become. A greedy, money-first, organization with no consideration for art or integrity. But, I suppose you pathetic 12 year old girls think this is \\"punk-rock\\" dont you? And I bet you have your N SYNC shirts (that was cool only like a year back) tucked away in your closet, hoping no one would see them. Disgusting.
0345413377|5.0|I read the entire series some time ago, but I am re-reading them now and each book has not lost the magical feeling I got when reading them for the first time. I have to say that both Northern Lights and The Subtle Knife are far better than this, but The Amber Spyglass is still a modern classic. There are some parts of the book which I found boring, but this book is still well worth the read. The majority of the book is exciting and gripping and although the book appears to be long, it consumes you so much that the majority of readers will finish it in under a week. There is one part that really lets it down, however, and that is the ending, which is simply depressing, especially seeing as Pullman develops the characters so well you feel as though they are real and you really know them and so their pain becomes your pain. Also, you realise this is the last adventure that Will and Lyra will embark on and this is also depressing, because it feels as though you are losing two good friends. To me, the His Dark Materials trilogy is the only decent thing Pullman ever wrote, which I find Ironic, because all his books are terrible, except for three which are among the greatest novels ever written.
B00007H1Y2|3.0|I must admit to enjoying the Buena Vista Social Club record immensely. It was retro without being slavishly nostalgic. Driving around in your car and listening to it you could quite easily pretend you were cruising the streets in Bautista-era Havana in a '55 Chevy Bel Air instead of running out to some suburban wasteland in your Audi for MexiFries at Chili's. This new Ry Cooder record isn't quite as free of pretense - working with Manuel Galban, who virtually invented this style of Cuban lounge, you can almost hear the recipe being consulted in the music. There are two parts percussion with found objects, one part spacecraft noises, and four parts atmospheric stringbending. There is some good guitar interplay here and the musicianship cannot be faulted - undoubtedly the NPR crowd will find much to like here. However, some of these songs don't seem to justify their existence and sound like they belong being played in a dentist's office (albeit a real cool dentist.) This thing works best if you listen to it all at once, in sequence. For some Cuban exploration by an American guitarist with a bit more fire, check out Marc Ribot.
B000002KIE|5.0|There's a soiled feel to this album -- a beautifully soiled feel.  Everyone talks about the Ramones and the Clash, perhaps because their musical output was so much greater, but the Sex Pistols, though short-lived, were a better band. Every good and successful rock band since 1977 owes a debt to the Sex Pistols, for their influences are heavy and far-reaching, heard even today in the sound of much inferior bands.<br /><br />The Pistols' \\"Never Mind\\" rocked the world well ahead of another \\"Nevermind\\" many years later, but the similarities between the two albums, especially the musically assaulting styles, are quite evident. Nirvana's [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]] may have been more melodic and polished, but like Nirvana, the Sex Pistols wrote 12 songs that contain an irresistable punk-rock charm, instantly catchy and familiar, yet also unique with a style all their own.<br /><br />There's no denying the fierce, driving sound of this record, which had to have influenced Kurt Cobain -- and many other musicians -- in tons of ways. \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" starts off at full throttle and never lets up, except for a few mid-tempo tunes in the middle. Song to song, the album hurls forth with bratty and defiant lyrics all over the place from Johnny Rotten, straight-ahead guitars and hookish bass lines that are surprisingly agile, and hard, boxy drumming that propel each song into immortality. Things get especially great toward the end on tunes like \\"New York\\" and a few others.<br /><br />\\"Holiday in the Sun\\" and \\"Bodies,\\" at the start, display a musical prowess from the Pistols that doesn't get mentioned enough. (The \\"Animal\\" chorus in the background of \\"Bodies\\" is especially well-timed and melodious, a sort of Def Leppard sound well before Leppard's peak in the 1980s on [[ASIN:B000001FKY Hysteria]].) The last four songs are also noteworthy: \\"Sub-Mission\\" (a mid-tempo tune) has an almost weighty, heavy-metal vibe, while \\"Pretty Vacant\\" and \\"New York\\" might be two of the best songs on the album. (Listen to the deep-throated voice that intersperses \\"New York;\\" Axl Rose tried to emulate that sound a decade later with his vocals on [[ASIN:B000000OQF Appetite for Destruction]].) Finally, the closing \\"EMI\\" is a stab at the hand that feeds.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" is a 12-song barrage of mostly quick, furious, angry rantings; a succession of defiance toward everything; a know-it-all attitude from four guys who happened to make one classic album. It's a record easy to love or hate, depending on who you talk to. Four hungry British lads who were geniuses or simply got lucky, depending on who you ask. No doubt, this fiasco of an album was made by four remorseless, unafraid, bratty individuals -- all of whom showed promise. It's sad the Pistols were only good for one record, that their fiery spirit went up in flames fast, but this album is the steadfast proof that there is only ONE Sex Pistols; most others are mere imitations..

B00006EXL5|5.0|Great music.....the whole cd is a great blend of what must come easy for the band. Cause it sounds really good, and natural. The way the album is put together makes this kind of music ever more exciting just to be involved in. Bands like MCR, Northstar, Thursday, GlassJAw, and Rufio....just to name a few.<br />I couldn't take the CD out of the disc player.....
B000068PQ0|3.0|Very colorful and imaginitive. Sometimes feels like they are trying too hard to be different- but there are other times when it is just plain original (the differences can be subtle).<br />  Overall, it is very fresh sounding- like &quot;fresh&quot; cotton candy. It depends if you have a sweet tooth.
0446608955|5.0|The Book was just as good as the movie.  They were not that much alike but they were both the best. They are diffrent enough to both be the best.
0553269631|5.0|Here's my own take. Every great book speaks to everybody. What makes \\"The Heart.. so very special, so very complex,is just that. These characters are us. We are these characters. Every one of them. Read the book and consider, that every single character symbolically died in this classic novel. This is a deeply profound book. Nobody gets through life without some kind of struggle. A nobel physicist told Naomi Judd to not go around the pain, but go through it. I am neither deaf nor mute, and yet I am exactly like John Singer. You are exactly like John Singer. We are Mick with a crisis. But life unfolds the most beautiful and brilliant multi-faceted spectrum. When we face those \\"death\\" struggles every day that seem like a tragedy in the moment, by passing through them, something of life issues forth. Courage issues in new found strength. For example, many a marine has strengths they never knew existed. Sacrifice issues in something else. At first, it seems that John Singer was almost angelic-like in his sharing and giving to everybody else, as the face of God guiding everybody else through their crises, but failed to resolve his own conflicts. On closer inspection, I realized that he may have represented a Godly Christ-like figure, who through the symbolic act of sacrifice, of even facing ultimate rejection and betrayal as part of the death experience, the sacrificial lamb brings life to others, brings the most unlikely of people together as with father and daughter, breaks down barriers as in the symbolic hand-shake at his own burial site, and brings in eternal hope and love as when she makes the promise. This wasn't a tragedy per se. This was a festive celebration of new-found life, as the biblical seed that grows into a monumental tree. Whatever, you're interpretation of any great book, let go your creative juices, run with it, listen to the music speak to you, read this beautiful classic novel as it were your own spectral jewel, or Mozart on phonograph. I will never forget this novel.
B00005JL2O|4.0|I had seen the first two movies in this series and figured Goldmember would be more of the same - and it was. A lot of the classic characters return, along with new babe Foxxy Cleopatra and new villian Goldmember (whose disgusting habit of picking his skin and eating it crossed the gross-out line).<br /><br />In this installment (very basically), Dr. Evil is back on his mission to destroy the Earth and he calls on Goldmember for help with his plan titled 'Preparation H'. To keep Austin Powers occupied, they kidnap his father Nigel. Austin and Foxxy foil Dr Evil's plan and save the planet.<br /><br />My favorite part is all of the pop culture references - the Osbournes make cameos and Fat Bastard goes on the Jared/Subway diet! There are also some crazy, unexpected twists that I do not want to give away, but they leave the door wide open for at least a couple more sequels....
B00002Z88D|3.0|I bought this DVD not knowing what really to expect.  The symphony was new and cool thru the first couple songs, but after the novelty factor wore off, I just wanted straight up Metallica.  I actually turned off the symphony--there is an option to change which band you are listening to.  The only problem is that the band sounds a little flat when you turn off the symphony.  I guess the makers of the DVD had the foresight to see the people who just wanted to listen to one or the other.  I think most Metallica fans will have the same opinion about the symphony.   <BR>   Also, the band plays too much of the new stuff, which I consider much less powerful and sell-our material.  Classical metallica is what I like--and th band does play some old school hits like &quot;fade to black&quot; and &quot;one&quot;.  Unfortunately, the good songs don't make up for the rest of the DVD.  Sound and picture are great, but I am going to buy a Metallica DVD that is older and may not have the 5.1 sound and digital pic. but the material will be much better and played with the passion that ONLY a hungry,up=and-coming Metallica can produce.<BR>    Recommendation for those that like good rock and roll is AC/DC's 'Stiff Upper Lip' DVD.  Angus is a god and you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  It is my favorite and I still watch it every couple weeks--it;s that good, guys.
B0000025DD|5.0|When you come right down to it, there was probably no other band in history that could just flat out \\"create' the way Pink Floyd was able to make music in the 70's.  From Meddle, Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.  Had they just made one of these albums, it would have made them a Hall of Fame Band.  The fact that they made all five is just plain astounding.  These songs were written during the midst of the creative run of Floyd. Although it isn't quite in the league of the quintet of Floyd albums, it's pretty solid stuff from the man who made Pink Floyd musically available to the world.  Gilmour has the most unique guitar chops.  Sounds easy to play, but try to do it with his feel.  Not so easy.  Only real dedicated players can pull off the Gilmour sound.  This is a great album.  Just because it doesn't have an overall concept should not take away from the sheer pleasure of listening to one of the great musicians of our day.
B000003NA4|5.0|Outstanding and oh so alluring collection of beautiful romantic ballads.  The clean simplicity of Diana Krall's smooth and sultry alto voice with only a string base and guitar and her own lush piano makes this some of the best music I have heard in years.  The thoughtful styling she displays in each cut on this CD makes this the ideal score for the concept of &quot;Love Scenes&quot;.  Her rendition of &quot;I Don't Know Enough About You&quot; (it's the cut that first hooked me on her) is bouncy and petulant and showcases her vocal and piano talent while her bluesy &quot;Lost Mind&quot; transports me to places dark and romantic.  Her take on &quot;I Miss You So&quot; exudes a wonderfully rich torch song aura and drips of romance.  Overall, the cuts on this CD are remarkably reminiscent of the combination of dark chocolate and cabernet - rich, smooth, tasty, and utterly romantic.  <br />Definitely a &quot;candlelight evening for two&quot; collection that should touch the true romantic in anyone who listens to it.  Ideally, the second CD for such an evening would be another of hers, The Look of Love.
6305971099|4.0|There are clearly a few problems with this movie, but I hardly noticed them at the time of its original release.  I left the theatre more excited about this movie than any horror movie I had yet seen.  The ending caught me totally by surprise and had my little circle of friends (all two of us) speculating over its implications for many days thereafter.  To say that this movie left things a little up in the air would be a misstatement of massive proportions.  Not only was I left to ponder the fate of Michael, Dr. Loomis, and little Jamie, I was mystified by \\"the man in black.\\"  Who was he?  What was his role in all of this?  I still think the concluding 10 minutes of this movie are the best 10 minutes of the entire Halloween series, although I would not dare place this movie on the same pedestal as the original film, which is basically untouchable by all pretenders to the horror crown.<br /><br />I have nothing but the greatest respect for nine-year-old Danielle Harris.  The makers of Halloween 5 put this poor girl through the wringer, and she shines from start to finish in one of the most physical roles I have ever seen man, woman, or child play.  As the movie opens, she is living in a children's clinic, unable to talk since the shocking events of the previous Halloween night and increasingly prone to seizures and fits brought on by some kind of psychic connection with her uncle Michael.  Eventually, she finds herself running for her life as her uncle chases her down with a car and then his trusty knife.  Then toward the end comes the unforgettable scene in which she finds herself lodged in a laundry chute inside the abandoned Myers house desperately trying to stay alive.  The depth of emotion and sense of utter terror she is able to convey is really quite extraordinary<br /><br />I have to admit I didn't particularly care for this incarnation of Michael.  No man can compare to the original Shape, Nick Castle, but the real problem for me in this movie is Michael's mask.  It just hangs loosely around his neck, and the sight of it flopping out on both sides like an extra pair of very large earlobes really kept me from seeing this masked killer as the Michael I know and love.  Donald Pleasance is, as usual, incredible as Dr. Loomis.  I admit, Loomis seems to be getting a little bit loony by this point in the series, but who can blame him?  Every time, he tells the authorities what is going to happen, yet no one ever believes him until it is too late.  Bearing the scars of previous encounters with Michael, his bravery and obsession with Michael Myers earns him five stars in my book every single time.<br /><br />Here are a few \\"problems\\" with this movie.  Let's start with the obvious.  What is wrong with the people in Haddonfield?  It is very important to keep in mind the fact that no body was ever found of a seemingly vanquished Michael after the events of the previous year.  Rachel, having barely lived through Halloween 4, not only leaves a spare key to her house on top of the doorframe, she leaves the door wide open while she is taking a shower.  Then there are these moronic teenagers consuming far too much of our time.  They insist on playing practical jokes on each other and even on the cops, finding the whole Boogeyman subject incredibly funny for some reason unknown to me.  It's hard not to cheer for Michael as he goes after these goofs.  Tina is incredibly immature, her boyfriend with the car fetish is unbearable, and her horny friends annoyed me as much as they apparently annoyed Michael.  Then we come to the cops.  Apparently, Michael's previous adventures have decimated the local police force because they are letting some incompetent people wear a badge these days.  Hearing some type of obvious clown music play when the two \\"super cops\\" first appear is basically unforgivable as far as I'm concerned.  Apparently, these two characters were supposed to supply some comic relief to a movie that needed nothing of the kind.<br/><br />Overall, I think this movie has moments of greatness that, for the most part, make up for its flaws.  Danielle Harris is amazing, and the final 10-15 minutes are riveting.  More than anything, though, I have to return to the fact that I left the movie theatre all those years ago totally excited about this movie and its mysterious twists and turns.  Any slasher movie that can inspire untold hours of speculation after the fact has achieved something quite rare indeed.this movie has moments of greatness that, for the most part, make up for its flaws.

B000002UAI|3.0|This album starts off with the incomparable &quot;Triad of Misery&quot;, certainly three of the most depressing songs in the Beatles discography. This could've been their &quot;dark&quot; album, but instead we get some weak covers and the standard light Beatles fare. &quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot; is a nice little song, but that's about the extent of it - nice. &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; could've fit right in on AHDN, with an atmospheric, giddy intro and catchy melody. But besides these five songs, everything else pales in comparison. A weak effort all around.
0060278250|4.0|I read sabriel and lireal and abhorson. But out of the three I feel this one is lacking. If I find a book that is very amazing I finish it in a daze, as if I was the main character or I had actually journeyed to some distant land. Yet with this book I felt untouched. The book basically follows the same storyline as the first and second book. The bad guy is different yet the basics are the same. I feel it lacked the suspense of the first book. When the actual journey is over and the main characters must face the bad guy it lacked suspense. The journey is what made the story interesting. I felt rather disappointed and though I am sure some may disagree I felt the book could have been better.
0028643151|1.0|This book completely exploits people's fears to make a dollar.    The problem with the book isn't whether or not the scenarios are valid or not (although there is a valid debate to be had there).  It's that the scenarios aren't put in perspective.  As far as I am concerned, this  problem pretty much negates the validity of the who thing. <br />  It's the equivalent of telling an agoraphobe about all of the ways they could be mugged while going to the grocery store.  Could it happen? Yes.  Is it likely? No.  Are you doing them a favor?  Certainly not.   Mr. Moran isn't doing the public any favors either.
B000002J09|3.0|Rumor has it that STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN was originally supposed to be a short rock number until the studio lights began to flicker and the band suddenly felt compelled to write additional lyrics and music.  The whole album is like that -- somehow touched by the magic of unseen musical elves!  These elves must've liked the blues, because there are a few amped-up howlers here.  But Page's &quot;doto-broso&quot; method of picking sets them apart.  Zep heads know all the talk that KASHMIR was supposed to go on this record, but I'm glad it didn't.  IV is nearly perfect as is -- marred only by the fact that there aren't enough big bass solos as in the classic HEARTBREAKER.
B0000640VO|5.0|One of the best comedies I've ever seen. Funny, stylish, great performances.
B000069HKH|3.0|Bruce can sometimes get on a guy's nerves.  Just recently he bashed &quot;American Idol&quot; and its ilk for being &quot;the theater of cruelty.&quot;  Well, excuuuuuuuuse me, Mr. Perfect, for enjoying a little in-your-face talent show escapism.  I suppose I ought to be memorizing every self-conscious line in these bombastic new tunes instead.  OK, now that I've correctly complained about Bruce playing the saint, I have to admit he can sometimes still convincingly play the part of the impassioned rocker, too.  Forget all the hype about this album being some kind of national trauma therapy.  It's a straight-up Dylan-influenced rock record with four great tunes and a lot of in-between.  Now, to get back to my reality TV ...
1560541970|5.0|This is one of Heyer's longer books and it is packed full of wonderful characters as only Heyer can write them. The Heroine is the impetuous Sherry, who when rejected by the 'love' of his life Isabella, vows to marry the first woman he sees. This happens to be his young playmate, Hero Wantage. She is a bit younger than Sherry (who is already rather young himself) and both are rather naive about life in general.<br />Sherry and Sherry's friends believe they can just carry with their lives as things were even though Sherry is married and Hero is quite happy for that to happen too - only as it turns out London is a lot bigger and a lot less easy for her to navigate in her usual good natured way. She gets fleeced by card sharps and has to be rescued from any number of scrapes by an increasingly worried and agitated and finally angry Sherry.<br />What makes this such a good read is that the humour running through it - Hero is a great character, and Sherry's friends are also fun - but underneath it is a very good story about growing up - becoming responsible and facing up to your responsibilities. It also has a complex mix of characters who keep stumbling over one anotherand interfering with each other's plans - and Heyer does this so well.<br />If you like Friday's Child you will probably also enjoy Cotillion and Convenient Marriage also by Heyer.
B000002P6R|2.0|Word has it that FACE DANCES was actually made by a completely different band than the guys behind WHO'S NEXT and LIVE AT LEEDS.  Some suggest that A Flock of Seagulls are actually the ones playing these goofy pop ditties as practice for their own storming of the charts.  Really, how did this thing make it out the door?  On the heels of all the galvanizing music made by the Clash and others, the Who comes back with, &quot;When I say I love you, you say you better!&quot;????  Bizarre.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|This is a great live record, with a great set list, great perfromance by AC/DC, great crowd noise, and some really good produciton. I never had the '94 remaster so I can't compare the sound quality to the new remaster that I have, but it sounds great! VERY highly recommended to any AC/DC fan!
B00005ATQD|3.0|This is the first movie that I've watched of Stanley Kubrick. Ironically and yet incidentally, it was his last!<BR>The plot of the movie was not very comprehensible to me. Among the various elements that it comprises of were the sexual desires, fear of one's partner's infidelity and hypocrisy. The point that the director has wished to convey is not very clear. Or may be that there was no point that he wanted to convey and just wanted to capture a still-shot of an ever changing & unending drama? But then, the plot did have an end that movies usually have - the main characters - a husband and wife decide to allow themselves to continue to live together.<BR>Though the plot is complex, there are certain definite positive elements in the movie worth praising. The pace of the movie suits the complexity of the plot and adds depth to it. The background music is haunting and enraptures the audience. The performance by the actors is, particularly, amazing & applaudable. Nicole kidman & Tom Cruise have performed impressively well, especially in the bedroom scene where they have a fight.<BR>Overall, it is a sort of movie after watching which you do not feel like having wasted time even though you might have watched it to just pass time!!
0316096199|5.0|It's hard to truly imagine what it's like to be raped, but after reading Alice Sebold's searing memoir I have an all-too vivid picture of its brutality, the emotional toll it exacts, and the impact it can have on one's relationships with family, friends and lovers.<br />Sebold weaves her brutal tale with flashbacks of her family life, her parent's and sister's reaction to the rape and the reactions of those close to her. Instead of being supportive, her father casts blame on her. Her self-absorbed mother who suffers from episode's of anxiety attacks cannot even attend her own daughter's court case when her attacker is brought to trial.<br />Alice Sebold makes the reader painfully aware of the lonliness the victim suffers. Treated like a pariah by both the women and the men on campus, where she is a freshman in college, Alice has to struggle each day just to continue her college education amidst an atmosphere where she is ignored, gossiped about and treated like she is damaged goods by boys she longs to date and befriend.<br />The ironic title of the story reflects a remark made by a policeman after she reports her crime that she is lucky to have survived. Another rape victim was found murdered in the very spot where Alice was raped. Alice's rape was her initiation into sex. She was a virgin when she was raped, making the crime against all the more cruel.<br />But Alice is lucky in a way. She has true courage and prevails in this searing story that includes a gripping court room drama, complex characters and writing at its finest. <br />I picked up this book because I enjoyed the Lovely Bones, and was not disappointed by Lucky, which captivated me as much as her novel did.<br />Sebold is a gifted writer. Lucky is compelling, powerful and ultimately heart-wrenching without being at all sensational or melodramatic. The book never falters from its first page to the end, taking the reader on a journey that is both powerful and poignant, disturbing and inspirational. <br/>Sebold illuminates a brutal subject with brillance and sensitivity. She evokes the horrors of rape -- both physical and psychological -- with such realistically rendered scenes, eloquence and honesty and weaves such a stunning tale that the reader can't help but be captivated. I couldn't put the book down and read it in two days. I can't wait for Sebold's next book.
B000088E6M|4.0|the album is definitely hot... after listening to the whole thing it actually sounds more profane than his underground stuff which is surprising. and i got a question for everybody: what the heck is up with Carson Daly taking on an ebonics thing when he talks to a rapper? anyone notice this? he talks normally when some 'other' person is on his show, but when dudes like Busta Rhymes or 50 Cent come on all of a sudden he starts talking with an accent. whatever. this album is hot (Many Men and In Da Club are the hottest tracks)
B000001DYD|5.0|It's taken me years to realize the brilliance of this album. It's a downright scary piece of art - I don't know if men find it initially off-putting, but I know my own squeamish sixteen year old girl-sensibility was certainly violated when I first heard it three years ago.<BR>My first reaction was to cringe away. I remember when I first heard the maniacal, parched moans at the end of the title track - \\"Lick my legs/I'm on fire/Lick my legs of desire\\" - I felt almost physically mortified; I wanted it to stop.  It's such a human moment, but far, far too human, the kind we prefer to sanitize and prettify most of the time, and the kind of brutal abandon rare even in art. We in the West believe we live in an extremely sexually liberated culture, but when you are exposed to that moment of sheer primal ugliness - and it is ugly, as well as terribly human - you realize just how shielded and antiseptic we are.<BR>The title track is probably the most brilliant, harrowing and perfect song on \\"Rid of Me\\", but the rest of the album is not far behind. You only realize just how funny, mischevious and playful this record is after multiple listens, when you've recovered from the initial bruising effect. It also brags one of the most striking and memorable pieces of cover art you're ever likely to come across, with Polly Jean posing as a kind of mannish, tortured Medusa. She looks both vulnerable and confrontational, exposing herself while daring you to make a judgment. Which is much like the album itself - initially it seems almost scalding in its nakedness, until you begin to see the knowingness behind it, the artifice, the humour. Not for the faint of heart, it's a record that deepens and becomes more unfathomable and ambiguous with every listen.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I can sum this movie up in one sentence, and I quote South Park--<br />&quot;I get it now--Job has all his children killed and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies...there is no God&quot;.
B00005JLXC|5.0|The best thing about Daredevil is the unparalleled sexiness of Jennifer Garner.  Forget about Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell and even Ben Affleck and his ridiculous permed haircut.  The only reason Daredevil is worth the price of admission is Jennifer Garner - period.  <br />She takes her spectacularly scintillating acting ability along with her solid bod and makes Daredevil a posh and fun film - despite the terrible script and screenplay and the terrible acting of Michael Clarke Duncan.  Let's be blunt here - The best thing about Daredevil is Jennifer Garner - don't kid yourself.
B00006J9OT|1.0|I ran across Diana Krall's name on Amazon while purchasing some blues CD's.  Based on the almost universal wild  acclaim in the reviews I decided to purchase her CD - the quality of the songs that were on the CD also convinced me that it would be very difficult for anyone to screw them up.  I apologize to Diana Krall fans but I only made it through the CD 1 and a half times before I punched the eject button and tossed it in the trash - $... down the tubes.  If you enjoy monotone, mumbled droning of classic music - please be my guest and buy this CD.  Bob Dylan sings with more inflection in his voice than Ms. Krall.
0060290110|5.0|I first read this book when I was 11-12. It wasn't the first, and it certainly wasn't the last, but it was the best. It just pulls you in, and you can't get out. Once you start, you will probably end up reading half of it in one sitting. From the first page, you are totaly envelloped in Narnia. You forget completely about the outside world. Once you read it, it becomes the book by which all others will be judged for the rest of your days. And trust me, its very hard to beat. I would reccomend it to ANYONE, whether they like fantasy or not, it is truly a study in good writing (the understatement of the 21st century). The religious undertones and the author's subtlty of sugestion leave the upmost room for interpretation. Getting others to read it will undoubtedly lead to endless discussions about the significance of Aslan an a god-like leader, or of the so obvious, yet hidden play between good and evil. Be warned. If you read this book, it will change your life.
B000002MFN|4.0|Madonna is by far my favoirte pop artist. She has managed to maintain a high profile and successful music career since she emerged in the early '80s, so not like her peer Michael Jackson who is finding his own career waning in recent years and making a new career out of personal scandals. I didn't really get into Madonna until late into her career with \\"Ray of Light\\". I own the majority of her albums. Of all her albums that I do own by Madonna, I have to say that \\"Erotica\\" was the one album that took time to grow on me. I wasn't hugely wild about the album when I first listened to it a few times. I recently listened to \\"Erotica\\" at the office and found myself really getting into the album. Sure this album came out at the time of that stinker \\"Body of Evidence\\" and that unintentionally funny book \\"Sex\\", it was grossly overlooked as a stylish departure from Madonna's earlier music. Gone is the cutesy pop music and here the listener is treated to a mixture of pop, disco, r & b, and techno (an early sign to where Madonna's music was leading her in the direction of). To be honest, I really do not care for \\"Erotica\\" however I like it a lot more than \\"Secret Garden\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\". Maybe it is the repetitious lyrics that turns me off of \\"Erotica\\". \\"Rain\\" is an alright song but a lot better than \\"This Used to Be My Playground\\" (from \\"Bedtime Stories\\"). My favorite songs off \\"Erotica\\" has to be the disco-like track \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" and the dark, techno-influenced \\"Fever\\". Despite its flaws, Madonna's \\"Erotica\\" album is by far a lot better and more interesting than any pop album released today. It still holds up in the ten years it has existed. No female pop artist can attain the commercial and artist achievements that Madonna has in the past twenty years she has put out music, and for that I love her for her abilities to remain relevant to pop culture today.
B00005RDSM|5.0|Peter Pan is a wonderful movie! I have loved it ever since I was a kid and even my kids love it too. When I heard about the special edition I told my kids and we all got very excited, we love this DVD. My 12-year-old daughter especially loves it, this is her favorite movie! Its a very family orented movie for everyone. This classic will never grow old in my heart!
B000002J03|5.0|In my opinion this LP was the best they ever did, blues, rock riffs and drum pounding music, really made my head throb..... &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; really converted me over to these guys, I had heard Stairway but that song was so over played, the riff from Heartbreaker made me go nuts, i went right out and bought this record, no CDs when I was young.... Whole lotta love was ok but I likied the bluesy &quot;Lemon Song&quot;, &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; was a classic too..... really great stuff. this CD is a must for any rock afficionado.
B00006IUL7|3.0|This is the prime example of hollywood intention to destroy a great piece of art and show us exactly what they wanted us to see..The original film iwas and still is a big success in Europe and Latin America and this film is not even close to original in any aspect!... The only good thing about it is the cinematography and Al Pacino.....nothing else is even close or near to the original film!...get that instead...you wont be dissapointed!
B000001EUR|4.0|I gave this version of Love at First Sting a four out of five rating. The songs on this disc are GREAT ! They deserve as many silly stars as one could possibly place upon them. My problem with this release is that it is being marketed to Scorpions fans such as myself who are expecting an upgrade in sound over the older cd version of this title. If this sounds like yourself, then don`t waste your money. There is no upgrade in sound. I don`t even think it has been remastered at all. I buy all the newly remastered cd`s that come out these days from my favorite old bands and most of them are truly remastered but not all. There is an expensive import version of this available that I was told has truly been remastered but I`ll wait until the Scorps redo everything and re-re-release it all again before I buy this disc for the third time.<br />TDJ (Houston)

0151006903|5.0|Unlike other reviewers, I do not have a foundation of Eco, as this is my first attempt to read him. Some have said that this novel is far more accessible than his others. Having owned a copy of Island of the Day Before for 3 years now and never getting past page 4....I must confess that this novel pulled me in almost immediately; so much so that it took me only 5 days to finish it.<br />Baudolino is a 'retelling' , of sorts, of the history of Constantinople; of myths and fables surrounding the former city; of Emporer Frederik Barbarossa; of the Holy Grail; of the extinction of the mythical Unicorn, and so much more. Packaging so many different tales of wonder into one novel, Eco succeeds as keeping a focused, discernible narrative throughout, the life of Baudolino as witness, interpreter, and chronicler of all these events.<br />Adopted at an early age by the Emporer, Baudolino adapts easily to a more privileged life than that of a poor man's child. While not forgetting his heritage, Baudolino makes use of his new station and ventures to Paris to continue his studies. While there, he meets other youths who are to become life-long companions.  The Poet, who apparently never writes a line of original verse, being on of the most prevalent and influential of his companions, and one of the most developed characters other than the narrator.<br />Baudolino returns to the court of the Emporer, having learned to craft fanciful and believable tales to delight and enthrall others, and making use of this skill so far as to set off on a quest to find the fabled 'Prestor John' and bring the Holy Grail to him. Neither, of course, are factual to this tale, but Baudolino does not let that deter him, or his companions, from their quest.<br />Following the death of the Emporer under questionable circumstances, Baudolino and company are flung into a further mission, to recover the 'Grail', which has disappeared, along with one of their traveling companions.<br />Here the book delves into mythical territory, as Baudolino and company encounter beings and creatures that only fantasy can create and sustain. But as most of Baudolino's life is wrapped up in fantasy that he has created, none of it seems anything but commonplace to him and his fellow travelers.<br />While I am not a fan of fantasy novels, this fits seamlessly into the story told, as in describing this type of journey into a 'fantasy' land, of course the details are made up and embellished to the best ability of the author of the story. Eco, through Baudolino's voice, creates a wonderous land of creatures, places, and events that let the imagination soar into lands that most leave behind with their childhoods. This story, while mostly invention, touches upon many factual themes, people, and events.  It informs, enlightens, and best of all entertains with what could be a dry, turgid history lesson, no matter how colorful the history of Constantinople. The blending of actual history with myth, and the adept imagination of Eco, works on many levels.<br />I highly recommend this book as a starting point for those interested in reading Umberto Eco. While purportedly not as well-crafted as Focault's Pendulum and The Name of the Rose (two more Eco novels that I will now have to investigate) it is a well-written and highly enjoyable foray into myth, fantasy, legend, and fact.
B00005JKG9|5.0|I saw this film 10 years ago. It's really hard, and sometimes dissapointing for me to love a movie that i haven't seen in a long long time again...well people..this could be the exception. atonishing performences by jack lemmon, ed harris, kevin spacy and al pacino. I can't believe that there is not a cheessy line of dialogue in the entire script ( really hard for an american movie!!!..and i mean it!). Even though this movie is not for everybody, is certaintly one of the best all man dramas of the 90's.....if you like top notch performences and real state...definitly buy this truly work of art.
B00005JLZL|5.0|Director Alan Parker has done it again.This is a provacative movie with a excellent cast.Great movie making in the tradition of \\"Midnight Express\\".Good screenplay by Charles Randolph.Kevin Spacey,Kate Winslet and Laura Linney all turn in top notch acting jobs.Zack(Gabriel Mann) as Bitsey Bloom's intern is excellent.Thrilling drama with many plot twists and a suprise ending.Looking forward to the video release.
B00005OWEG|5.0|for all time...for every generation...the greatest
B0000507R2|2.0|This was the first DVD-A I heard and it was a treat.  Then I listened to a real DVD-A (Graham Nash's Songs For Survivors, recorded direct to hard disk &amp; mixed straight into DTS).  Tigerlily is a great album and the DVD-A is worth hearing, just not critically.  If you really want a sit-down listening, get the CD.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Wow!! I love this CD! Usually I am someone who listens to the melody and music first rather than the words of the song but this time I actually listened for the words of John Mayer and realised that he has created an amazing record with great, unpretentious songs that you can relate to. He is also a fantastic guitarist! My favourite tracks are '3x5', 'St Patrick's Day', '83' and 'My Stupid Mouth'. <br />BUY THIS RECORD - VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
B00005221M|2.0|(Original movie itself I would give 5 stars easy)<BR>I like others was very excited about aquiring the DVD version of one of my favorite movies of all time. But I just can't understand why so many DVDs are destroying a good thing. I have only great things to say about the theatrical release. I have seen the VHS so many dozens of times that I know this film backwards and forwards, know every line, every piece of beutiful score, and wonderfully shot scene. So I feel it is a travesty to see some of my favorite lines of dialogue edited out. I mean I thought that I might be seeing MORE of what I loved not less! I have nothing against previously unrelesed footage. But don't touch the substance of what we all remember and love from the original.<BR>I also have a problem with the way the score was redone with this DVD version. It just didn't seem thought out at all, forced rather. And the fact that they took out the soulfull Clannad piece (the only vocal song on the Soundtrack) near the end is just unforgivable.<BR>As far as I could see most of the new footage was mostly battle sequences. And, yes, those are spectacular and impressive scenes, obviously costly and time consuming. But to me 30 (give or take) more seconds added to the \\"Seige of Fort Henry\\" are not compensatory for scrapping a several lines of dialogue in another scene. <BR>After scrutinizing the \\"Director's Edition\\" I can say that I think that the editors did a better job themselves with the theatrical release. Some of what was put back in was just as well to be left on the cutting room floor. (Possibly with the exception of the final scene - \\"Last of the Mohicans\\"). Still I can see why they made the choices they did.<BR>As far as why they relesed this version and not the original on DVD breaks my heart and baffles my mind.<BR>I hope that this review helps some Last of the Mohicans fan(s) out there to understand what they are getting into with this buy. If I could return this DVD I would.
B000000OTY|5.0|I've followed the Gabriel/Genesis/Collins/Banks/Rutherford phemomenon since 1976 (thanks to a great family, the Rosens of New Jersey, who introduced me to the best music to come from England since J, P, G &amp; R)--<br />This is Peter at his peak--the staging is unique and puts you right on stage with the band--Paula Cole, Tony Levin--masters themselves, jamming alomg with the rest of the fantastic band.  The live versions of Pete's songs, especially Steam, Red Rain, Sledgehammer (which I didn't even care for much as a studio song),and especially Secret World are different from and in my opinion superior as live performances.<br />Only drawback: not a DVD--the sound is superior hi-fi---but still, we all have gotten used to the &quot;Skip&quot; and &quot;Forward&quot; buttons.  Oh well.<br />To my eyes (ears), that have seen at least 50-150 concerts on video/DVD, this is in the top 5.  A masterpiece to me (I just saw his new tour and he is still fantastic--looking forward to *that* DVD)--I couldn't reccomend it highly enough.<br />Nice going, Pete, Paula, Tony, and all the rest of you guys (especially Peter's ingenious tape loops--especially Secret World--perhaps the best &quot;loop&quot; I've ever heard).<br />Ian Schneider<BR>New York City
B000083C49|5.0|What starts out looking like the end of mankind turns light and whimsicle thanks to the cast and Leonard Nimoy's direction.<BR>The crew travels back in time to present day Earth to find the key that will save the planet from a powerful alien presence that is threatening future Earth.<BR>Nothing heavy here except for the key they're looking for and some Earth-shattering storms.<BR>Even if you're not a big Star Trek fan, it's hard not to love this movie. The cast never takes itself seriously and looks like they're having a good time. No big space battles, but you wont care.<BR>I bought the regular edition, but I'm selling it to buy this one which is cheaper and has more extras.(?)<BR>Buy it, you'll love it.
B00005JL96|1.0|I was so excited when I purchased this video for my two year old son.  Just got done watching it with him and now I may invest in a shrink wrap machine, repackage this train wreck of a movie, and take it back to the store.  The previews for the movie made it look like it was a funny movie.  Stich appeared to be a very likeable and humorous character on the previews, but when you watch the movie you wish that he was put to sleep at the dog pound.  It's a sad story about a girl that lost her folks and has no friends and is about to be taken away by DCFS.  Sounds like a good feel good movie?  Sure there is a moral to the story and of things all work out but I really was hoping Stitch would have drowned or something.  I am upset that I have this movie in my house and that my son will be watching it again.<br />The only reason I gave this movie 1 star was that there is not a 0 star option and I enjoyed the Elvis music.  That's it.<br />Stick with the Lion King or Toy Story.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I find her voice and style a wonderful change of pace. This is a good mix of jazz and easy listening. Very mellow and yet something you want to listen to. I like this group of muscicians that are up and coming. Norah, Meyer &amp; Krall.<BR>Great CD!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a great movie to watch if you liked the book. I have seen many movies because I liked the book and have been disappointed. This is one movie where I have been very satisfied. The characters Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy played by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth have made the movie a real treat to watch! I have watched this movie about 15-20 times since I got the DVD. Each time I watch it, it seems as though I am watching it for the first time. A DVD that you should definitely own in your movie collection if you like Jane Austen.
B000002ADT|5.0|With each subsequent listening the layers, moods and complexities continue to slowly rise to the surface, only to submerge again, like the flow of a lava lamp. This is a wonderful addition to any music collection, and a great 'intro' purchase for those new to jazz.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Hello fellow AC/DC fans, I have 2 thoughts on this release and it goes for the rest of the catalog reissues as well. If you have never bought this release or bought a copy before 1994 then I would definitely buy this. The package and the sound are great.<BR> However, if you, like myself bought the first &quot;original tapes remastered&quot; version released in 1994 , I would pass. It sounds exactly the same as the new &quot;original two track remasters&quot;. If you want to upgrade for the pkg(new cd booklet) then go for it. If you are looking for miracle updated sound forget it. By the way, the 5 stars are for the point of view of &quot;I don't have this yet and wonder if its worth it.&quot; For me the person on the third round of AC/DC reissues, it rates 2 stars for the Digipak and Book!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Ok, by now I assume you know what Metropolis is about, so let's go to the juicy parts: You want to know how it looks and how it rates to other versions.<br />First of all, the one thing you will notice inmediatelly is that the quality of this DVD is *OUTSTANDING* (when considering this is a 1927 movie). The digital wizards that restored the film not only got rid of the scratches, they actually went all the way and instead of using an automated process to restore the film they went BY HAND frame by frame and fixed all imperfections. They fixed the grainnes, the contrast, AND the shaking (common to old film). The film almost looks like if it was recently shot with a black and white camera, it is THAT good. They even went further and when they combined many reels from different sources into one scene they actually fixed the images on both reels so that you don't notice the difference between then (i.e.: the transitions occur seamlessly).<br />You can find out about all this in the included documentary on the restoration. They even mention that such a painstaking and expensive process is not used in most films, but due to the importance of Metropolis they went all the way.<br />I also recommend you read the small booklet included which has even more information.<br />As for the story, I have to admit that I was completely surprised. The movie now makes sense!!! For example, in previous \\"mutilated\\" versions of Metropolis, we were all told to believe that the robot was created to control the masses. Now we learn though that in the original film, the robot is really the creation of a scientist whose wife dies, and thus he tries to recreate her again.<br />Also note one quarter of the film is still missing (sadly, very likely forever), but thanks to deep research they restoration team actually found out what was missing, and for those missing scenes they include special \\"title cards\\" that explain in text what's missing when (when you watch the movie this does not distract you, since it feels that the titles are part of the movie, this being a silent film after all).<br />Also, you will find TONS of scenes you very likely never saw before in any previous version, and this also makes the film feel \\"complete\\". You will also be amazed at the grandeur of some of such scenes, giving any modern \\"monumental\\" movie a true run for their money. This also has to be said about the special effects, which in many cases hold up pretty fine even in today's age of digital wizzardly.<br />As for the soundtrack: WOW. Now finally the soundtrack follows the action on the screen!!! They actually went back and restored the original soundtrack and used the original written clues in the soundtrack notes to find out what went where. Now everything feels much more in place and the music sets the mood in many scenes, making the movie much more enjoyable.<br />Let me summarize this by saying that after watching this Kino Version of Metropolis, I went RIGHT AWAY and dispossed in the garbage of all my other Metropolis versions.<br />All I can say is that this is a true labor of love, and that my deepest humble thanks go to the team that did this restoration. If I were one of them, I'd be extremelly proud for acchieving something many thought impossible. It finally makes justice over 75 years later to an amazingly great film, very likely the film \\"that started it all\\" when it comes to science fiction and many other genres (I can see 2001-A Space Oddisey, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Terminator, and the Matrix all being directly and heavily influenced by this film).
0553108034|5.0|With his second book in this series, Martin continues to cement himself among the frontrunners of the fantasy genre.  A Clash of Kings continues to be a complex, but fast-paced trip through an engrossing world of honor and treachery.  While Jordan's WOT continues to grind to a tiresome and frustrating pace, Martin keeps churning through his story.  Long, the books may be, but by the end you are far from where you started.  There are a lot of characters to keep track of, but anyone exposed to the maddening numbers of Aes Sedai should be OK.  As for Goodkind, sorry folks, I enjoy his books, but they aren't even in the same league as Martin or Jordan.  Goodkind's stories have a tendancy to contain inhumanly perfect characters, and unbelievably perfect endings.  Martin presents human characters with human flaws and situations that don't always work out just right.  Realism is refreshing in this genre.  If you are looking for a more mature fantasy that can hold it's own with the best in the business, Martin is the way to go.
B00005YW4H|3.0|First, I am not a fan of the &quot;untrained&quot; voice.  Any professional singer owes it to his/her public to learn the correct way to use their instrument -- in this case the voice -- and while Norah's voice is pleasant, she has NO breath control and a lot of her notes just peter out into nothing.<br />That said, the songs are OK.  I liked this version of &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;, but didn't like the Hoagy Carmichael &quot;Nearness of You&quot;.  The other songs I was not familiar with and it may take a few more hearings before I feel comfortable with them.  Pleasant, you know, but no standouts.  What I was most impressed with was the album's production.<br />So, now that she's won all those Grammy's, one assumes she will have enough money to take the voice lessons she needs.  Then, who knows?
B000067G3C|5.0|This is a great, fast-paced movie, refreshingly free of high-rise terrorists with hostages. This movie is on TV frequently, and I never tire of it. By the way, the gap in the road that the bus jumped was on a downhill section; that's how the bus cleared it. How many people will die before the villain is caught?
B000070IXT|5.0|>>Marilyn Manson worked on the soundtrack, so it's no surprise that Resident Evil is best enjoyed by headbangers, goth guys, and PlayStation junkies&lt;&lt;<br />This is one of the most biased BS opinions I've ever seen in my entire life. I like this movie, but I've never played the game and never wanted to. I hate head-banging, it gives me a headache; and I'd love to give a swirly to every goth guy I've ever met....still I like the movie. This movie shows how wrong our obsession with new scientific advancement can reach. There is a point of no return in creation sytems. Thus movies, games, etc. like Resident Evil try to remind us that we are very fallable; consequently, messing with scientific areas such as cloning, viral exchanges, and re-animation needs a precision we as humans aren't able to meet yet. This is not a gore movie made for every hack who pretends they worship the horror genre, but a what-if movie that provides us a wake up. We need to respect the knowledge we've discovered and it's abuses, or resident evil will be upon us. It doesn't take a doomsdayer to figure out this movie is scary because of its reality.
0875847706|5.0|Based on their experiences, the authors show us that inspiration does come from every-day events.  The book invites you to see life from a different perspective, if you wish so.
0783114893|4.0|This is an excellent film choice when you're wanting endless suspense and terror. This movie is PACKED with it from start to finish. C. Thomas Howell gives a great performance as the naive young man who makes the mistake of picking up a deranged hitchiker in order to keep awake during the lonely, dark, rainy night. Almost immediately after letting the stranger in, he becomes uneasy and suspicious but isn't able to get the guy out of the car until he's forced to choose between life and death. Although he thinks the nightmare is over he soon realizes it's only just begun after witnessing the guy in another car he's passing along the highway. And so begins the cat and mouse game between the two. The wonderful Rutger Hauer delivers one of his best performances as the cold, calculating predator who takes a strange liking to the boy since he was the one who got away. The killer's reasons are never officially revealed but for a few subtle signs such as the wedding band he wears and constant demands to the boy to \\"stop me\\", this showing to us his crazed longing to die. He won't do it himself, will not stay imprisoned behind bars, and certainly won't end the madness until his selected pawn destroys him completely. My guess is he was a once normal, happily married man whose world got disrupted tragically and now has nothing to lose since his sanity has already left.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I just got thru watching the first episode- wonderful stuff.<br />I could not help but smile at the first entrance of each character- like seeing old friends again. Wonderful acting, wonderful story.<br />Looking forward to buying all 7 seasons- especially since they don't show DS9 on TV in Chicago!!!...<br />One warning: It was difficult removing the disk from the holder, and I pressed too hard on the eject button and snapped it off- so be careful. This is largely due to the more brittle plastic used in the all-transparent parts.
0783235380|5.0|By now, you've already read the basic plot. The only bad thing about this movie is that all the colors seem murky and muddled; even sunny (lit.) scenes seem cloudy. Just watch it in a dark room and things should be fine. Aside from that, I really enjoyed this movie. I could identify with some of the characters. Great special effects, too.
B000069CWE|5.0|Well after Hybrid theory many were expecting great things from Linkin Park.Some skeptics also thought that the pressure of making anything after the success of their first album alone, would make their second album a wreck.    Not so.Now I am aware that technically this is not their second album -the latter is what they are working on now- but just a filler to appease the fans.    Never a fan of remixes I was pleasantly surprised to find that they knew what they were doing when they remixed songs that were so good, they needed no remixes.Rather than an improvement , its like an encore, each song accompanies and compliments its original counter parts.    The beats are great.The album has a great vibe to it, it sizzles with creativity and idea and of course the fact that they are talented helps.A great album overall, I would highly recommend it to any linkin park fan.However if you are not well aquainted with the band, I'd reccomend you buy 'Hybrid Theory' first, and then get your hands on a copy of reanimation.
B000059R8Y|3.0|This album is quite a treat! We all know Clapton from his numerous albums and hit songs over the last few years, so his appearance on this album is not too surprising. His guitar work on &quot;Reptile&quot; is smooth and jazzy, like Wes Montgomery with a pina colada in his hand performing an instrumental duet with Jimmy Buffett. &quot;Come Back Baby&quot; is a lonely plea to a lost lover, whose gender is ambiguous in the lyrics, in true modern-songwriting fashion. This album is very politically correct. &quot;Find Myself&quot; is a soft, soul-searching exercise that delves so deeply into the human psyche that it may as well be a graduate course in psychology. <br />But the real treat on this album is the reappearance of Billy Preston as Clapton's sideman. In fact, Clapton should have put Preston's name on &quot;Reptile&quot; instead of his own-Preston clearly dominates the melodies on this album. (Or could Preston be the &quot;Reptile&quot; to which Clapton refers in the title?) I really hope he continues to be a fixture in Clapton's group, because he may be the factor that keeps Clapton's new music in the public consciousness. If you like this album, you should check out Preston's other albums; you will not be disappointed. However, since He is such a strong presence on &quot;Reptile,&quot; this doesn't come off as being a &quot;true&quot; Clapton album. If you like the legendary sound of Clapton, you should listen to his non-Preston collaborations. Therefore this album is really a 3 star album: 5 stars for Preston, but only 1 star for Clapton.
B000007MVM|5.0|If you are a big fan of the later (post-barrett) Pink Floyd, this album is not for you. Although Barrett was with the band briefly, both him and floyd are different things. Barretts post-floyd is very raw and relies more on the quality of the material written rather than polish (the shape - not the shine). Barrett is not for most people, and by saying this I don't mean his music is for the &quot;sophisticated&quot;, I mean its for those who can appreciate a man and his guitar, whose music flows from his soul rather than a studio switch-board.
0780624890|5.0|What do you do to bring to life one of the more sinister comic book heroes ever?  First, find the brooding, muscle-clad Wesley Snipes to portray  the remorseless character, Stephen Dorrif as the ambitious, power hungry antagonist , the crusty Kris Kristofferson as the heroes supporter, and throw in the able directing of Stephen Norrington.  You get &quot;Blade,&quot; a fine action film which some fantastic action sequences (despite the spotty special effects) and a storyline that keeps you interested.<br />The film follows Blade.  A powerful, cold Vampire Slayer, played impeccably by the imposing Wesley Snipes, who does make all other ficticious Vampire Slayers (Buffy ect.) look timid by comparison.  Blade himself is half vampire, who has all of their strengths (except slower aging) and none of their weaknesses (except their thirst for human blood).  Blade is assited by his longtime friend, Whistler (Kristofferson) in his quest to rid the world of Vampires, humans who have certain genetic differences that makes them sensitive to sunlight, garlic and silver and an all powerful thirst for the blood of humans, the one weakness that tortures Blade, since he too has it.  Blade slowly finds that a power hungry Vampire named Frost (the ruthless Stephen Dorrif) is forcing his way through the vampire ranks to become all powerful, i.e. more like Blade.  None of the Vampire weaknesses will apply, and Frost will lead an army of willing vampires to dominate the human race.<br />The kinetic style of Stephen Norrington is everywhere, as the film moves at a steady pace, smartly slowing down, and speeding up only when it needs to.  And when it does speed up, look out.  Snipes is given ample room to show off his martial arts skills against hordes of Vampires, and Norrington quick camera moves captures them in spectacular fashion.  The headspinning climax of Blade battling Frost is a throat-grabbing tour de force, as can probably be said about the rest of the film.
6304698623|5.0|I have watched this film several times on TCM and believe that each time there were differences ... especially in the ending. In one version, the daughter finds her father recuperating from his war wounds next door to the school where she has been forced to work as a scullery maid after notification of her father's death.  In the second version, she finds her father in a hospital ward.  There are other differences.  Both versions are beautifully wrought and well performed ... but it would be interesting to know why two endings were shot and which ending is included in this video.
B000063CPL|5.0|Yes, that's the 1st thing I have to mention here: hearing Bruce Dickinson (the REAL Clansman!) singing the two songs on here when he was absent from the band, and we had to hang our heads down in shame as we heard 'Blaze' (nice name) trying to sing alongside other legends like, Steve Harris. Hearing Bruce do, Sign of The Cross and The Clansman, makes you pray one day they could put something together (which would be paying off Blaze) where Maiden could do those two albums over with Bruce at the front. I don't know why anyone is complaining about the track list? This was the tour in support of Brave New World, and you get a healthy dose of songs off that one. Plus the two tracks I just mentioned. Wrathchild and Sanctuary are also in the 1st disc, and after Fear of The Dark, on the second disc, you get 5 Maiden classics, such as Number of The Beast, Iron Maiden, Run To The Hills, 2 Minutes To Midnight and Hallowed Be Thy Name. OK, I'll admit, how Running Free, or Phantom of The Opera could not be in here is a bit of a drag, but with Maiden, the list of killer tracks absent, could be their whole catalog of tunes, from 1980 on! The sound is better than A real Live Dead One; I think it's about as equal to Live At Donnington though. With live Maiden, it's always going to rule, so you can't go wrong here. I will always say that, Live After Death, was the best live one they'll ever do, and it is, in my opinion, the best live metal album ever done-and I mean EVER. Don't let this one slide by you. And remember: JUST SAY BRUCE TO BLAZE!! ***** 5 STAR ESSENTIAL LIVE MAIDEN RATING, FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF POWER METAL. Cheers!
0553812173|3.0|I loved nearly everything about this book-the creativity,the intelligemce,the need to constantly surprise and entertain the reader with imagery and ideas.What stops it getting the full five fom me though is a uniform lack of depth to all the characters.This may be a personal point though ,but I NEED to get involved,to emotionally latch on to my characters-Again and again the story would NEARLY begin to grip me,but!....would then move on to yet another character in yet another place.The author has a fantastic imagination but didn't really back it up with a great story.But don't let me dissuade you.It's a fun,entertaining read and hopefully these characters will grow in the next installment.
B00005JKED|4.0|This movie will probably be remembered as one of the best urban crime films ever, mostly because of the hellish presence of Denzel Washington, the fine acting Ethan Hawke, and the ultra-gritty directing Altonie Fuqua.  The film follows Hakes' character in his first day in LA's notorious Narcotics Division.  There he meets Washington, a veteran of the Division, whose morals have been corrupted by years of seeing the worst of humanity, or his appetite for power, which ever you believe, but either way he seems to give justification to every action he takes (\\"Were wolves among sheep, it takes a wolf to kill a wolf.\\")  But some of Washingtons' action seem to go far beyond the line, and Hawke questions his reasons for them.  The movie is also given a great, challenging script in order for the actors and the audience to question the limtis of the law, and power.
B000003S0D|5.0|1970's &quot;Lizard&quot; is King Crimson's third album, and it is arguably their most overlooked, which is shameful because it is also their masterpiece. &quot;Lizard&quot; is a spellbinding disc, an outstanding whirlpool of ambitious progressive rock, fused together with jazz, funk &amp; classical. Tracks like &quot;Cirkus,&quot; &quot;Indoor Games,&quot; and &quot;Happy Family&quot; are just giddy with power. &quot;Lady Of The Dancing Water&quot; is an incredibly beautiful number, a truly memorable Crimson ballad. And finally, the four-part title suite, featuring none other than Jon Anderson of Yes on marvelous guest vocals, is a mindblowing epic. Brimming with energy, emotion, and beauty, &quot;Lizard&quot; is King Crimson as you've never heard them before.Two trademarks of this legendary rock band are their supreme musicianship &amp; production skills, and on &quot;Lizard,&quot; this version of King Crimson deliver nothing less. Once again, Robert Fripp lays down some truly haunting guitar licks, both electric &amp; acoustic, and he's also a master mellotron player. Gordon Haskell's deep voice &amp; equally deep bass fit the bill perfectly. Andy McCulloch's drumming is fantastic, and Mel Collins beautifully decorates the album with various flutes and saxes. Special mention must also be given to guest musician Keith Tippet, who contributes some pretty nifty piano &amp; electric piano parts, most notably on &quot;Happy Family.&quot; And produced by Fripp &amp; lyricist Peter Sinfield, the album sounds superb, with the music, vocals, &amp; sound effects practically *leaping* out of your speakers.  Sadly, this phenomenal version of King Crimson quickly closed shop after the &quot;Lizard&quot; album was finished. They didn't even tour, and Robert Fripp switched to a completely different line-up for the next Crimson album, &quot;Islands.&quot; You'll have to ask Fripp for the reason why. Nonetheless, I am so grateful to Fripp &amp; company for making this album. &quot;Lizard&quot; is without question my favorite King Crimson album, and it always will be. Although there are many other classic Crimson albums like &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King,&quot; &quot;Starless And Bible Black,&quot; &quot;Discipline,&quot; etc., &quot;Lizard&quot; is the one that I enjoy the most. It is one of the most sensational slices of prog-rock ever recorded. &quot;Lizard&quot; is truly a King Crimson album to treasure. :-)
1563890119|5.0|I haven't felt this way reading a comic book for a long time.  Sandman, the Lord of Dreams; Morpheus as he is known, is a silent character that somehow seems to exude a power that many have dreamt (ahahah) of.  The art is terrific, portraying powerful images with exquisite detail.
B000068UXF|5.0|I owned a VHS tape of this performance but did not hesitate ten seconds to buy the DVD.<br />I doubt that the work was ever performed this well in Strauss' lifetime.  I remember some wondrous performances at the Met with the likes of Rysanek and Ludwig and King and Berry but these were merely wondrous.  <br />This performance is, as someone here already observed, historical.  And beautiful.  And beyond praising.  And yes, it should be on c/d.
B000066AUE|2.0|This isn't the real \\"Eye in the Sky\\" album!  It's a ... \\"Best of\\" without any real graphics or liner notes.  (I haven't opened it, since it's going back, so I could be wrong, but I doubt it.  There is a picture of AP himself, sitting on a chair, on the cover.)<br />What this CD says that it has on it is:<br />- Eye in the Sky<BR>- Time<BR>- Damned If I Do<BR>- Standing On Higher Ground<BR>- Mammagamma<BR>- Psychobabble<BR>- Games People Play<BR>- Stereotonomy (That's how they spelled it - i gess that they don't have a profreeder)<BR>- Sirius<BR>- Snake Eyes<br />...
B00004TRD8|5.0|Dear Amazonians,<br />When I first viewed Terminator 2: Judgement Day in the theater, I was blown away.  Since I got the Ultimate Edition of this DVD about three years ago, every time I watched it, I got the same thrill as I got the first time I witnessed not only one of the best action thrillers of all time, but on of the best dramas of all time.<br />Many viewers have referred to this movie as an action movie, but I consider it to be something much more, a drama.  This story of a young boy (John Connor), who befriends a machine from the future sent back to protect him from a ruthless ultra-advanced Terminator as he grows older, is very personal.  The movie is violent, but goes beyond pure violence and noise for &quot;shock value,&quot; and presents something truly special.  I continue to watch Terminator 2 with the same passion and interest as I expressed when I saw the original release.  And, the Ultimate Edition goes even further, putting footage that was never seen ino the feature.  Now, the story makes even more sense as you see how Sarah Connor struggles with the will to destroy John's protector, while John displays some of the traits that he will need as the future leader of the human resistance.<br />I very strongly recommend the purchase of this DVD.  You will not be disappointed by its appeal.<br />Take care, as Always,<br />--Daniel
0805066691|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I've ever read on Native American history.  It is also a heartbreaking, stomach-turning account of the white man's arrogance, perfidy and blatant cruelty.  Mr. Brown tells the whole truth in vivid language, sparing nothing, which is as it should be.  This was not an easy book to read, but rather a very painful and poignant one.  It deserves your full attention.
0440237688|1.0|The Giver was one of the most dark, sick, demented & depressing books I've ever read!<BR>It's amazing to me that the publishers would think this type of book would be suitable for \\"young readers.\\"   It was unnerving to read about the euthanasia of infants in the story and also the suicide of a little girl was just plain sick! <br />    I was very upset that this was required reading for my twelve-year-old son. I wish authors and publishers will come to realize that you don't have to have darkness and death in a book to provoke thought and emotion. Books with a light subject matter can be just as entertaining!  Overall if this book was written for an adult audience I wouldn't have a problem with it. However being that it was targeted towards youths, it was totally inappropriate!
B00005QZWI|5.0|This CD has quickly become my favorite of any. And now, as I wait for TTT Soundtrack, ALL I can listen to is this! This is a beautifully arranged soundtrack and Howard Shore's work is AMAZING. I don't know how anyone can listen to this and say it's bad. This CD is so stunning that you can see the movie happening in front of your eyes! Though the shipping was a little laggard (It took 2 Weeks for it to get here, but it was due to the weather I'm guessing), I found it was COMPLETELY worth the wait!
B000003TAL|4.0|I'm not a hard core Sonic Youth fan by any means, this is actually the only album I have by them.  I intially put off listening to this band cause I thought they were just pretentious grunge noise makers from the early 90's.  <br />This album is a good mix of fast punky yet poppy rock, with TEENAGE RIOT, TOTAL TRASH, SILVER ROCKET and CANDLE being my personal favorites.<BR>Then you have the more ambient or sqwaky experimental noise breaks like HEY JONI CROSS THE BREEZE and most notably PROVIDENCE.  These too are interesting and are pretty well listenable.  <BR>The Closing trilogy is nice because it is not a long 17 minute noise fest but 3 almost seperate songs that flow pretty well together.<br />On a lyrical and vocal note I would say they are not really memorable but they have their moments especially on the more poppy songs. I like the instruments alot better.  I do not like Kim Gordon's voice or her lyrics most of the time they either sound silly or it makes me think of Courtney Love.  The only exception is her contribution to the final Trilogy song.<br />Still I can see why this is considered a classic album for this reason: Although there are a couple of stand out songs TEENAGE RIOT and TOTAL TRASH these sound a whole lot better in the context of the album as a whole.<br />Pick this up.

0201633612|5.0|As a java developer, I was reluctant to buy this book because I thought I wouldn't understand the sample code.  So after trying out some patterns books written for java developers, I finally broke down and bought this one.  I'm glad I did.  This book is far more understandable and readable than the java patterns books. I finally feel I have an understanding of the patterns, the problems they address, and the considerations for using them.  My recommendation is that if you are an experienced java developer, don't waste time on the java patterns books - buy this one and read it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|this movie is wonderful.  from execution, to climax, the movie is phenomenal.
B000003S2K|5.0|Brian Eno's beautiful ambient texture music began with this.  Originally it was intended to be used for exactly what its title implies, Music to be piped over intercoms at Airports.<br />Of course this utilitarian use of the music implies sterility; backround music; elevator music; grocery stores playing George Benson tunes.  <br />True this music could serve this purpose and one could simply write it off as such, however I would challenge those critics to listen to it more closely.  It depends on many variables, the listener's mindset, the atmosphere in which it is being listened to and even the volume that it is played at.  <br />It is these subtleties that make this more a piece of art than simply a pop music recording.<br />To describe the actual pieces does not really do much but I will try.  1/1 - Is centered around slow repeated piano chords, which are all you initially hear upon first listening.  If you turn up the volume more you can make out synth pulses and bass reverb drones that accent the piano beautifully.  The use of space throughout the piece leads to an airyness and light feeling and the repetitive nature, if you clear your mind is very relaxing.  This is subtle Psychedelic music.<BR>2/1 - Begins after a silent intro.  An angelic synth female voice &quot;sings&quot; a simple &quot;aahh&quot;.  It does sound a bit New Agey, hokey at first but again if you relax and just listen it evolves into numerous similar voices with slighty different tones overlapping each other and the repetive nature of the piece at times will make you forget and not notice that these are essentially human voices, abeit, heavily phased.  It boils down to pure sound which helps to engulf you.<BR>1/2 and 2/2 I can't really describe right now because I usually listen to this as I go to sleep and I am at least half concious by the time I get this far into it.  I will say that they are more like combinations of the first two tracks and I beleive they are more instumental and morephased and synth oriented.<br />Definately give this a listen if you like jazz, or classical music or you are having trouble sleeping.
6305268843|5.0|I heard of this film from a 17 year old boy; he loved it and his mother brought it to me.  I was transported by the love between the man and woman.  The scene on the stairs where they merely lean into one another was the most loving thing I have seen in years.  Sex doesn't always equal love. What was shown in that one scene was love.  When I play the movie in my head, it is that that I see.  I have to have it [the video]. I searched the web for hard to find videos.  I did find it and spent quite a lot for it.  On a whim I logged onto Amazon, typed in Firelight, and up it popped, for dollars less.  I feel dumb, especially because what I bought has no description, I took a leap of faith.  From now on, Amazon.com first, then the web.  Thanks.
B000007MVM|5.0|If you are a big fan of the later (post-barrett) Pink Floyd, this album is not for you. Although Barrett was with the band briefly, both him and floyd are different things. Barretts post-floyd is very raw and relies more on the quality of the material written rather than polish (the shape - not the shine). Barrett is not for most people, and by saying this I don't mean his music is for the &quot;sophisticated&quot;, I mean its for those who can appreciate a man and his guitar, whose music flows from his soul rather than a studio switch-board.
B0000028RR|5.0|I got this cd after Evil Empire and Battle of Los Angeles, and let me tell you.. not only is this the best Rage cd, it completely makes the other two look bad. Bombtrack has a great intro (i can play it though :P), Know Your Enemy is the all time best Rage song, Wake up is great, Killing in the Name is very good and will have you yelling swear words at the end of the song.<br />If you're into this music i definetly recommend this over the other rage cds (which are still good!) <BR>By the way, i think this cd blows audioslave away ! :P
B00006RU5B|5.0|When I first heard the songs such as &quot;Cochise&quot; and &quot;Like a Stone&quot;, I knew I had to own this album.Using the singer from Soundgarden and the dudes from Rage was a great idea. With these men combined, a great album was made. Additional great songs are &quot;I Am the Highway&quot;, and &quot;What You Are&quot;.If you are a fan of Soundgarden, or a rock fan at all, I totally recommend this album because of its awesome songs, and brilliant lyrics.
B00005A46T|5.0|wow this cd blew me away...i thought affter the release of their first album and all the overplaying of the song wait and bleed the second album would be mainstream and not like the sound of the first album... but listening to it has proved me wrong and they still kick ...
B00008BXJG|5.0|i heard these cd`s would be restored to their original australian cover art and track listing.  sadly this is not true.  these new remasters are good, but if you want the real deal goto ebay and get the albert box set.  it contains all of the bon albums with the original art and songs that were not included on the american (or these remasters) releases.  it will cost you ... for all of the bon albums.  if you have never seen or heard the original australian release of dirty deeds this is worth the price of admission alone.  do yourself a favor and get the albert releases.  if you are reading this then you know that bon is not only one of the greatest frontmen in rock history, but he is also one of the most underrated lyricist(sp?) ever.<br />RIDE ON<BR>  i`m lookin` for a truck

0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold came up with such an original plot, resulting in a wonderful book. Often sad, sometimes funny, the book is ultimately a love story that gives the reader a sense of hope. I loved the book!
B00005O3VC|5.0|Let me tell you this: the first time I watched this film, I don't think I laughed at it once. It seemed distant to me, a strange film that was sort of comical-looking, but it just plain didn't click with me. A few days later, I told someone I'd seen it, and then, for some reason, in description of it, it became utterly hilarious. And that's the way Monty Python seems to work. If you're not already initiated to the Monty Python style of humor, just go talk to someone who loves it, and suddenly you'll find yourself laughing like you've never laughed before. It's like the film just may be so brilliant that you need a little help to get you to realize that there's a joke, even with it glaring you directly in the eyes. The Python troupe, on top of that, plays it like they're in a period piece for most of the time -- throughout the film I don't believe a single one of them cracks more than the smallest smile. Of course, when I saw the film again, I was in stitches, and I am forever a Python fan. And while one of the most brilliant jokes I've ever seen doesn't appear in this film (it's in Monty Python's Meaning of Life, and it involved an animated leaf), there's definitely more than enough gut-busting Pythonesque madness here to sate your laughter or you might want to check for a pulse -- you may think you're going for a walk, but you're not fooling anyone.
B000001ELD|3.0|I listen to the entire CD and found it was well done, not the best but well done.  I could tell that people where expecting something harder but if you give this CD a try, then you can say if you like or not.  It could have been done more better then it was but when you are the only one writing the song for this CD then there would be less ideal and maybe he didn't want to create an over baster of metal that we hear from Kiss, but something that diffent. I think that if he does another CD, I think he would get it right and heavy but most people would still not like it.  This CD is somewhat heavy if you listen to it.  To tell you the truth he sound something like Paul.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|The team that restored Metropolis has done an absolutely fantastic job.  This is certainly one of the greatest silent films, and now we can see it again in all it's glory, as it was meant to be seen. Sure, there are some missing parts, but they have put in just the right title cards and stills to fill in those gaps.  I could go on and on about the greatness of Metropolis and the restoration ... but I will sum it up in one word: AWESOME!
B000025IIN|4.0|Hello.<BR>Can I get the text's for Mariah Carey's CD Music Box?<BR>from Karen
B00006X06U|5.0|Being Joni Mitchell couldn't be easy.  When she emerged on the music scene in the late 60s, her songs of love - and love's illusions - captured a legion of fans who felt she was singing of their own hopes and disappointments.  They claimed her, almost as a possession, then felt betrayed when she showed an independent spirit and began to explore new musical territory; they were among the first to scorn her work in THE HISSING OF SUMMER LAWNS, HEJIRA, and MINGUS.  And although she attracted new fans during this period, many of them would later attack her work on BOTH SIDES NOW and, more recently, TRAVELOGUE - they didn't like the orchestras she utilized, or the quality of her voice, or the absence of new material (conveniently forgetting they were the same ones who dismissed the new material she wrote for TAMING THE TIGER).  Clearly, the road of a musical pioneer is a bumpy one.<br />I've been listening to TRAVELOGUE for over three months now, and I'm mystified by the slings and arrows directed at this superb two-disc set.  As for its perceived weaknesses - well, the lack of new material certainly isn't a problem; in fact, the songs on TRAVELOGUE have been reconsidered and reinvented in a way that makes each of them sound freshly minted.  And those who've criticized her use of an orchestra (and made it sound as though the album's been submerged in a kind of symphonic marshmallow cream) simply haven't listened carefully to each cut.  Ms. Mitchell, Larry Klein (her co-producer), and Vince Mendoza (her arranger and conductor) have too much taste and sound musical judgment to go for cheap musical tricks; the strings and wind instruments on TRAVELOGUE have been used in the same way a painter uses a brush stroke - sometimes sparingly and sometimes emphatically, adding a touch of color here, or a bit of shadow there.  As for Ms. Mitchell's singing, it's true the years (and more than a few cigarettes) have left their mark, but the voice remains a warm and expressive instrument, full of texture, character, and humor.<br />Selecting standout cuts here is difficult, because both discs - from beginning to end - are wonderful to listen to.  I could list \\"Amelia,\\" \\"Love,\\" \\"Ludwig's Tune,\\" \\"The Sire Of Sorrow,\\" \\"Be Cool,\\" \\"Refuge Of The Roads,\\" \\"Hejira,\\" and \\"Cherokee Louise\\" as personal favorites, but I have a feeling in a week's time I'd probably single out different songs, because TRAVELOGUE reveals new riches with each listening.<br />On a purely selfish level I hope TRAVELOGUE isn't Joni Mitchell's last recording, because she represents one of the few oases in the wasteland of contemporary music.  But ultimately she'll decide which road to follow, and this is why she's cherished by her genuine admirers - because she weighs the options, and goes her own way.
B000003CMC|5.0|I was a young Southern rocker when this record came out in the early 70s and, like most, was grieving over the tragic loss of Duane Allman. A lot of people bought this record out of respect to Duane, but really didn't expect much of an album made up of Fillmore leftovers, Duane-less studio tracks and Duane's last work in the studio with the band. In short, we thought this would be the band's swansong.<br />Listening to this record now, however, it is obvious that this may be the best work the Allmans ever did. The studio tracks that kick things off show that Dickie Betts and Gregg Allman had more than enough talent between them to continue making vibrant music for years to come.<br />The live tracks are blistering forays that come very close to quality of those found on the Fillmore East album. Even the addition of the much-maligned Mountain Jam fits beatifully - a single extended and admittedly self-indulgent jam executed with the passionate precision of masters.<br />The three studio tracks with Duane that close out the set show the band at its inventive best - particularly the hit Blue Sky and the pensive Little Martha. Yes, Duane was gone... but all was not lost. Eat a Peach showcases all the mesmerising facets of the Allmans in one outstanding package.
0790729970|5.0|Reviewing the movie: I'm not a Jim Carrey fan, i'm really far from them (i think his acting in other movies is... well, dumb), besides, this movie is one of my favorites, and nobody could portray a better Mask character than Carrey.<br />This movie is not only a feast of special effects (by the ILM guys, inspired in the cartoon antics of Tex Avery), musical numbers, and laughs; this movie also has a message in it -- \\"From Zero to Hero\\".<br />Yeah! i know that this is part of the main title of the DVD (in theatres, it hasn't this title), somebody could think that Zero is refering to Stanley Ipkiss, and Hero is the Mask, but this title is NOT refering to the Stanley Ipkiss' Mask character, it's refering to Stanley Ipkiss himself! The Mask character is far from being a Hero, it's really a headache to Ipkiss and the society in general, but when Ipkiss realizes that he doesn't need the mask and began to confront his inner fears (and \\"the bad guys\\") without the mask help, that's when Ipkiss become a Hero... in the real life, somehow that's something that we can achieve when we stop \\"wearing our masks\\" and begin to act like ourselves, showing to the other who really are we.<br />Reviewing the DVD: The audio and video quality are good (the sound is Dolby Surround 5.1 and the video is remastered); this is a double sided disc, in one side you get the Full Screen version of the film, in the other the Widescreen version (something common in \\"old\\" dvd's), in the extras side, you can see 2 deleted scenes (but without commentary..), an audio commentary by Chuck Russell (here you can learn why those 2 scenes where eliminated... unfortunatelly the audio comentary doesn't have any subtitles, so, if you're not an English speaker, probably you'll have a problem); audio in english and french, subtitles in spanish, french and english; the theatrical trailer.... the box says that the dvd has Production notes, but i can't find none.<br />This is a good movie, and it doesn't matter if you're not a Carrey fan (like myself)
B000026ETU|4.0|Most of the other reviews focus on the fantastic, must-have content of Zebop (eg; Tales of Kilimanjaro, Primera Invasion) so I won't dwell on this.<br />The purpose of this review is tell Santana fans that this version is the most definitive available at this moment in our world on cd. This cd has the correct red cover (not pink!), doesn't have the ugly \\"Compact Disc, Digitally Mastered Analog Recording\\" symbol in the bottom right hand corner, contains all the lyrics in the booklet plus a photo - and even sports a clear spine!<br />If you're like me and you appreciate authentic reproductions of LP artwork etc., then this is the version for you. Stay away from the ugly American 1980s cd releases (I mean they were pressed in the 80s). It seems that on www.amazon.co.uk, most of the Santana catalogue bar Caravanserai was released in the last couple of years.<br />By the way, this review will also show up under the pink Zebop 80s release for some crazy reason - DO NOT BUY THAT ONE!!!
B00005QIPH|3.0|I'm not arguing that the strokes aren't good, I myself am A fan. Although your misconception that they are trying to play some new kind of rock music is completely ridiculous. All the Strokes are doing is recycling the sound of the pre-punk bads like the Velvet Underground.  This type of music has been done a million times before, it just so happens that the Stokes happen to be easy on the eye, thus propelling them into rock stardom along with bands like The Hives who borrow from bands like the Stooges and the Sonics.  All music is recycled in one way or another and the Strokes just happen to be one of the hundreds of bands out their doing just that.  Next time you try to influence people to listen to something, lblue151, try knowing what your talking about
B00003CXAA|2.0|Francis Ford Coppola's ?The Godfather? trilogy represents a landmark achievement in American cinema. Okay, maybe not Part III, but cumulatively. The first film established the benchmark of excellence that by Part III was starting to look rather clich?. In ?The Godfather? we are introduced to Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), a Mafia kingpin who rules his underworld empire with compassion and family honor at heart. What is fascinating about Coppola?s interpretation of the Mafia is that it examines them not as criminals per say, but as struggling immigrants unable to secure their place in the new world without being forced to resort to intimidation and violence.  In the first film, the Corleone empire is threatened almost from the star. After the jubilant wedding of the Don?s only daughter, Connie (Talia Shire) the Don is almost assassinated. Michael (Al Pacino), the son who has been groomed for legitimate business, vows revenge and achieves it in assassinating the rival Don whose orders almost killed his father. But when the heir to Vito?s throne, Sunny (James Caan) is brutally murdered at a toll booth, Michael is forced to step in and assume control of his father?s underworld empire. <br />Stemming from a prior incident, Paramount didn?t want Brando on the film. Ditto for Al Pacino, though in that instance their apprehension seems to have been predicated on the fact that Al was then an unknown quantity in Hollywood. Shire had to practically beg Coppola for her role. It all worked out in the end. ?The Godfather? set a benchmark for cinema violence and took home the Best Picture Oscar. Two years later, ?The Godfather: Part II? would sweep the award, winning more Oscars than its predecessor. <br />In Part II Coppola?s formula film making is cemented by a parallel storyline: the first picks up where part one left off, with Michael now married to Kay (Dianne Keaton) and living near Lake Tahoe where they raise their children. However, as part two progresses the marriagedisintegrates into a bitter custody battle. The other plot point of Part II regresses to 1930s New York and charts the rise to power of Don Vito, on this occasion played to perfection by Robert DeNiro. Part II is by far the most intricately balanced and thoroughly explorative of ?The Godfather? trilogy.  <br />Part III is something of a rehash and a disappointment. It assumes a straight forward story involving the aged Michael. Reconciled with Kay ? at least on speaking terms ? and now a struggling diabetic, Michael?s hopes for his children are shattered when his son refuses to pursue a law degree and his daughter, Mary (Sophia Coppola) is accidentally assassinated on the steps of the La Scala Opera House. The penultimate showdown of Part III is reminiscent of the final acts of the previous two films. It offers nothing new or viscerally stirring to the saga of this crime family. Evidently, the Academy of Arts and Sciences agreed. ?The Godfather: Part III? took home no Oscars.  <br />The DVD transfers of these three films from Paramount Home Video are in short a dismal disappointment. Although Coppola did shoot his films with a decidedly dated look, none of the transfers included in this collection are anything but dated by the ravages of time. Color fidelity and balance are inconsistently rendered. Flesh tones are either faded pink or too orange. Blacks, browns, dark grays and blues all appear as one gigantic muddy brown mess. Fine detail is completely lost. Digital compression artifacts, film grain, aliasing, fine detail shimmering and video noise are prominent throughout. <BR>Oddly enough, out of all the transfers, Part I looks the best while Part III, the newest of the bunch, represents the worst example of tiling and color bleeding that I've seen in any film from the eighties. Also, Part II is inexplicably spread across two discs. Paramount?s reasoning is presumably to avoid compression related problems on a lengthy film -which still abound - yet Part III, whichshares almost the same running time, is compressed onto one disc. Chapter references on all three films is bare bones - for a three hour movie, twelve chapter stops is inadequate. All the extras for these films are lumped together on a separate disc, but with all the problems I've just listed and the added disappointment of not being chapter referenced. Unfortunately, for fans of these immortal classics, Paramount Home Video has given us an offer all too easy to refuse!
039472903X|5.0|My gosh!  What a book!  This is, without a doubt, one of the best books ever written on advertising.  And certainly the most entertaining.  <br />You'd have to be a brain-dead advertising or marketing moron not to learn a thing or two from Ogilvy's abundant war stories.<br />Ogilvy's wit abounds.  A few of his gems:<br />\\"There have always been noisy lunatics on the fringes of the advertising business.  Their stock-in-trade includes ethnic humor, eccentric art direction, contempt for research and their self-proclaimed genius.  They are seldom found out, because they gravitate to the kind of clients who, bamboozled by their rhetoric, do not hold them responsible for sales results.....  I comfort myself with the reflection that I have sold more merchandise than all of them put together.\\"<br />\\"In saying this, I run the risk of being denounced by idiots who hold that any advertising technique which has been in use for more than two years is ipso facto obsolete.  They excoriate slice-of-life commercials, demonstrations and talking heads, turning a blind eye to the fact that those techniques still make the cash register ring.\\"<br />\\"I sometimes wonder if there is a tacit conspiracy among clients, media and agencies to avoid putting advertising to such acid tests.  Everyone involved has a vested interest in prolonging the myth that all advertising increases sales to some degree.  It doesn't.\\"<br />\\"Do I practice what I preach?  Not always.  I have created my share of fancy campaigns, but if you ask which of my advertisements has been the most successful, I will answer without hesitation that it was the first ad I wrote for industrial development in Puerto Rico.  It won no awards for 'creativity', but it persuaded scores of manufacturers to start factories in that poverty-stricken island.  Sad to say, an agency which produced nothing but this kind of down-to-earth advertising would never win a reputation for 'creativity', and would wither on the vine.\\"<br />\\"On an airplanenot long ago, I overheard the following conversation:<br />'What business are you in?'<BR>'Engineer.  You?'<BR>'I'm an account executive in ad agency.'<BR>'You write the ads?'<BR>'No, copywriters do that.'<BR>'That must be a fun job.'<BR>'It's not easy.  We do a lot of research.'<BR>'You do the research?'<BR>'No, we have research people for that.'<BR>'Do you bring in the new clients?'<BR>'That's not my job.'<BR>'Forgive me, but what is your job?'<BR>'Marketing.'<BR>\\"You do the marketing for the clients?'<BR>'No, they do it themselves.'<BR>'Are you in management?'<BR>'No, but I soon will be.'\\"<br />That's not all!  There are reprints of many of David Ogilvy's classic print ads.  Including some that aren't Ogilvy's (for example, Volkswagen \\"Think Small\\".)  Ogilvy's Rolls Royce ad, which sold out Rolls Royce North American inventory, is also reproduced.   Along with Ogilvy's print ads for Schweppes, Hathaway Shirts and Puerto Rico.  <br />A gold mine of ideas.  <br />As David Ogilvy writes at the end of the book's overture:  \\"If you think this is a lousy book, you should have seen it before my partner Joel Raphaelson did his best to de-louse it.  Bless you, Joel.\\"<br />And bless you, David Ogilvy!
B00005JKNF|4.0|An old fashion who done it set at an English country estate circa late 1920's.  Director Robert Altman has really outdone himself with this classy, classic caper.  Using his usual, highly textured, dialogue style, character and plot threads overlap in intricate ways that command the viewer's strict and close attention to everyone and everything.  Michael Gambon is the murder victim.  Stellar turns from Dame Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas and Helen Miram, among others, make for a fascinating trip to the country.<BR>Alliance has done a fair job mastering the DVD.  Contrast appears a bit low at times and colors are often muted or seemingly dull, sometimes blending together in dark scenes.  Overall, this muted appearance suits the story well.  Fine details occasionally shimmer and there is a bit of edge enhancement that crops up now and then but nothing that terribly distracts.  Overall, this is a great movie that one can never get tired of watching over and over again, particularly because there are so many Altman subtexts working together throughout the plot at any given time.  A definite must have.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is an indie movie, meaning that it's geared towards an audience that doesn't like to sit in front of their televisions like unmotivated stumps. Throughout the entire film Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a dangerously schizophrenic high school student who lives in a California suburb, finds himself losing his mind after his adventures guide him to places he doesn't understand but gains some pleasure in nonetheless. Through and through Donnie finds the world to be an  unforgiving mess that, through a series of lucky manouvers, has not rotated off of its axis. That is, until Donnie discovers how he can change the world.<br />Unfortunately, Donnie isn't the only one confused. The manner in which the [highly talented] cast were callously sprinkled throughout the film, the incessant thematic flip-flopping, and the erratic film style makes it look like the crew was trying too many things at once. It's understandable that films do [and should] pack in numerous ideas and themes--take Darren Aronofsky for instance--but these ideas and themes are also to have coherent direction. &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; seems to have that direction, but when you're travelling down the road a theme or idea abruptly stops so that another one may begin. The result is that the film is complete but not fulfilling.<br />Another problem is the fishy issue of time travel that the filmmakers didn't truly develop. Besides a brief and rather conjectural conversation Donnie has with his Physics teacher (played by Noah Wylie), I wasn't convinced that time travel really was a good idea for the film to run with. Unfortunately there are multiple &quot;conversation bursts&quot; as opposed to easy-flowing dialogue throughout the entire movie so hardly anything anyone says is very palpable. All of this serves as a glaring detriment to what could have been one of the more inspired movies of 2001.<br />But this isn't to disparage one from watching the film. I very much appreciated [what i could understand] the frame of the movie, which I would make into a question as opposed to a statement of somesort. &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is, as a forewarning, *very* indecisive but still an enjoyable experience.could understand] the frame of the movie, which I would make into a question as opposed to a statement of somesort. &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is, as a forewarning, *very* indecisive but still an enjoyable experience.
6305736650|5.0|What more can be said about Casablanca, the witty, stylish, sweeping romance?  Bogie is Rick, a classy, hard-boiled cynic who meets up with his old flame, Ilsa in the exotic port city of Morocco. Problem #1: Ilsa's married to Victor Lazlo(Paul Henreid).  Problem #2: Rick has letters of transit that he's not willing to part with.  Problem #3: The Nazis.  Problem #4: Louie Renault, the prefect of police, though in the end, he turns out to be Rick's best friend.  The supporting cast is marvelous: Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt - all consumate professionals.<BR>This disc includes the documentary \\"You Must Remember This\\" hosted by Lauren Bacall.  Warner's master for Casablanca is generally good, though since its release Warner has done more pristine work on DVD.  The quality of the documentary is disappointing.  Images are grainy, with digital compression artifacts and shimmering details that generally distract.  Still, this is one of those golden oldies that every collector should have.  Play it again, and again, and again, and .....

B000063K2W|5.0|How does one take a totally acidic down right risqu Broadway play and transform its wickedly perverse dialogue into a brutally funny cinematic experience. Well, if you're director, George Cukor - working under the rigid constraints of a production code that does not permit such lascivious banter then you simply ask the show's scenarist, Anita Loos to write even more acidic double entendres to get her point across. The result: \\"The Women\\" (1939) an inspired and scathing, divinely hilarious comedy with 135 women and NO men.      The plot centers on Mary Haines (Norma Shearer), blissfully living in her fool's paradise as the happy wife and contented mother. That is, until she accidentally learns that her husband Steven is having an off camera affair with ruthless man trap Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). Determined to, first, save her marriage, then later, live the remainder of her days as the carefree divorcee, Mary eventually comes to an understanding. She wants Steven back!    Mary's gaggle of fair weather friends include her vapid and gossipy cousin, Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell), nave ingnue Peggy Day (Joan Fontaine), the ruthlessly charming Countess DeLav (Mary Boland) and vixen on the make Miriam Aarons (Paulette Goddard). At one point the film degenerates into a riotous cat fight complete with pulled hair, lots of kicking and even a racy full bodied bite on the thigh. Buttressed by its stellar performances, outstanding dialogue and a fashion show sequence shot in blazing Technicolor (in an otherwise B&W film), \\"The Women\\" is 99 and 1/2 % pure magic. Only its ending leaves something to be desired.     Crawford and Shearer were hardly the best of friends. Both divas at MGM, Crawford was fond of saying of Norma, \\"How can I compete with her? She sleeps with the boss!\\" True, but Shearer was married to VP, Irving Thalberg at the time. Fearful that \\"The Women\\" would prove the catalyst for a real life catfight, Cukor kept the two actresses separate for as much of the shoot as possible. He really had nothing to fear: both Crawford and Shearer behaved like total professionals both on and off camera and their mutual dissention worked marvelously well in their on screen confrontations.     Warner's DVD is a miracle of mastering. The B&W picture exhibits a near pristine rendering with an exemplary gray scale, solid deep blacks, perfectly realized contrast levels and very clean whites. The Technicolor fashion show is so vibrantly realized it seems to burst into 3-dimensionality off of the screen. Rarely does pixelization intrude for a very smooth, thoroughly satisfying visual presentation. Fine details are so breathtakingly defined that close ups often yield the thickness of make up and accuracy of hair strands and fabrics used in costumes. Only during the opening credits is there a subtle hint of misregistration that results in a slight haloing effect around lettering and main title art work, but neither is distracting. The audio is mono and extremely well balanced.  Extras include the complete isolated musical score and a \\"Romance of Celluloid\\" short subject on Hollywood style.      Any year but 1939 and \\"The Women\\" would surely have won Best Picture. In the year of \\"Gone With The Wind\\" it never had a chance. Thankfully, we'll always have the film on DVD.
B00005JLZL|4.0|I really enjoyed The Life of David Gale, although the editing made the story feel very rushed.  I love Kevin Spacey, and he gave another compelling performance in this movie.  I didn't much care for the casting of Kate Winslet, though she too did a good job.  I love how the movie keeps the audience guessing right up until the end.  VERY strong political statements are made and really hit you over the head, but since it is supposed to be from this man's perspective, even this point can be explained and justified.
B00003CX9E|5.0|It's no secret and no wonder why Citizen Kane continues to captivate audiences 50 years after its initial release.  By now everyone knows of, or has heard about, the epic battle to have the film boycotted and destroyed.  William Randolph Hearst was not a happy camper when this fictionalized bio, that strangely paralleled his own life, hit the big screen. But there was little he could do to stop audiences from taking to it like moths to a flame.  Welles directed, produced and stars as Charles Foster Kane, a man so encapsulated in his own wanton revelries that he gradually collapses under the weight of his own debauchery.  <BR>Warner Home Video has at last given this American classic a stunning digital transfer.  The film elements rarely show signs of their age.  Contrast and shadow delineation is remarkable.  The audio has also been nicely restored.  Included on a separate disc, &quot;The Battle For Citizen Kane&quot; a revealing look inside Welle's creative process and the driving force of a newspaper tycoon that almost stopped the film dead in its tracks.  This is a must have.
B000051Y0G|5.0|First off, I'm 16 so what the heck am I doing writing about something that my older cousin owns on record? Well, for starters I love 80's music (heck, I was born in the decade!) I like my hip-hop, R&amp;B and Justin Timberlake pop era too but this album has got to be my cure for getting out of the blues. I LOVE this album, not gushing, but I LOVE it. It's so good, even though Cyndi does not have a diva voice, she can belt it out like she was one. I absolutly love &quot;Time After Time&quot; and the controversial &quot;She Bop&quot; and of course you can't miss with &quot;Girls Just Wanna...&quot; well you know the rest. The live tracks on the end are pretty special and give a new twist on some classics so this is a keeper of an album. I recommend this album for anyone who just wants to jump around and let it all hang out cause this album will do that. &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot; kicks it off, which I like in it's hard-rocking sort of way. The Prince remake &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; is excellent, Prince whould be proud, &quot;All Through The Night&quot; is another fave of mine, very mystical and dream like. &quot;Witness&quot; sounds like something The Police whould do, you know the guitar work not the Cyndi singing part :) but I like this song nonetheless. &quot;I'll Kiss You&quot; is kinda dumb, really demanding and dumb (I sometimes skip this one). &quot;Yeah, Yeah&quot; is just down right fun and scream out, &quot;Yeah, Yeah&quot; over and over again. Cyndi is the coolest, she's not afraid to have fun and be strange at the same time. I'm sorry Britney but Cyndi, Madonna, Janet, Whitney, Mariah, Taylor, Paula and Jody will always be my fave pop queens.
B00003CXB2|3.0|Lawrence of Arabia is the thinking man's epic, a brilliant adaptation of the life of an English patriot and the Arab revolt captured brilliantly by director David Lean. Peter O'Toole is marvelous.  Alec Guinness superb.  Omar Shariff, enigmatic and compelling.  This film really represents a high point in 60's American cinema and film in general.   <BR>That Columbia Home Video chose to restore the film to its original length and Technicolor glory back in the 1980's is commendable.  That they mucked up the DVD transfer is irreprehensive.  <BR>Although color fidelity is stunning, edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering fine details plague this transfer throughout.  It's frustrating to try and indulge in a story when the whole background surrounding the characters is in a constant state of motion.  There are many scenes free from these annoying problems but just as many ravaged by them.  <BR>Extras, a documentary, featurette, trailers and more are ample but presented with a considerable degree of edge enhancement as well. Also, the collector's keep case has trouble closing.  Overall, this two disc set could have been a much more stirring visual experience.  What a shame!
B00000J6AG|1.0|I was dinning with some friends of mine when I took a liking for the track that the bartender was playing.  When I inquired about them, he said it was Moby's Play Album.  I bought it, it's the worse music I've purchased in a while.  I'm upset that the bartender got it wrong.  I read Moby's synopsis on AllMusic.com, I've got to admit that even AllMusic got him wrong.  The guy's stuff is musically dead.
B0000065O1|5.0|I have many many workout videos and this one is THE BEST.  It has cardio for very effective fat loss, which also tones muscles in the process, along with an excellent toning section.  Radu (her trainer) really focuses on form and effectiveness and Cindy Crawford is a great inspiration, showing that she's just a regular woman like the rest of us, who just started working out to 'fit her size 6 jeans' but then found the athletic feedback to be even better.  Great music and scenery, along with limited need for space and equipment (only dumbells).  Definately a 'must buy' for anybody in search of a hot body.
0060537639|4.0|Did China's fleets chart the lands of the earth long before the Europeans? Perhaps. But whether or not you agree with Gavin Menzies' conclusions you will most certianly be entertained by this fascinating and thought-provoking research.<br /><br />China, during the Ming Dynasty under reign of Zhu Di, was a nation foremost in wealth, power and technology. It was within this context that China launched the Treasure Fleet under Admiral Zheng He with the mandate \\"to proceed all the way to the end of the earth to collect tribute from the barbarians beyond the seas...to attract all under heaven to be civilised in Confucian harmony\\".<br /><br />Did Zheng He succeed? Menzies lays out a litany of evidence including maps predating European exploration; carbon dating sunken ships; stone monuments; DNA and linguistics; plant and animal migration; and the journals of explorers such as Columbus and Verrazzano to support his argument that he did indeed.<br /><br />While some of Menzies' arguments may require a little leap of faith and some of his conclusions may be the result of his exuberance of discovery his book is, nonetheless, arguably plausible and undeniably thought-provoking.

B000068FUM|5.0|Being a huge fan of classic rock my entire life, this 33 year old finds it very refreshing to come across a band as talented as the Jayhawks.  If you enjoyed their prior endeavors, you will plunge deeply into a state of nirvana with this one.  With so many fly by night groups popping up on the music scene, it really is a pleasure to come across the Jayhawks.  Their blend of beautiful vocal harmonies, steady guitar rhythms, and intelligent lyrics will make you realize 1)Why they are in the class w/The Beatles, ELO, etc., and 2)In today's world they don't get much airplay on the radio- their music is simply too deep to be cheapened by the sound that has plagued our airwaves for far too long !!!  If you are not sure which CD to purchase next, you owe it to yourself to add this one to your collection.  You won't regret it !!
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent has been known on the streets and underground rap world for a while and any one that heard him then knew that he was destined for the mainstream lime light.  Sure he used to say &quot;If you commercial I'll hurt you&quot;  but who gives a damn.  He hasnt changed his music at all, he is just being supplied with more commercial beats.  Every song on the album is good.  It includes 3 bonus tracks. Everyone knows Wanksta.  There is also two of his old hot street joints U Not Like Me and Lifes On The Line which are both off the hook.  His best songs on the album are the grimey Heat, Many Men, Whats Up Gangsta, Back Down and Blood Hound.  The whole album is good.  Gotta give props ta 50.  G UNIT
0791071685|5.0|I thought Vonnegut was good when I read Slaughterhouse Five, but then I picked up Cat's Cradle.  I won't ruin any of the story for you by telling you what happens, but it is, like Vonnegut's other books I have read, funny, but at the same time makes you think.  Keep an open mind when you read it, that would be my only advice other than read it.
B00000ILDE|5.0|To this day I can't remember a movie that had me sitting on the edge of my seat.  I can still recall the first time I saw this film in the theater and I think I left fingernail impressions in the armrest. The special edition DVD does not disappoint.  I enjoyed the extra footage and other extras.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed over and over again.  I put this movie behind the first two Star Wars movies as the best sci-fi films ever.
0385503954|4.0|The author has divided this book into 3 Parts and an Epilog. The book is written in chronological order. I had a hard time figuring out the time period of Part 1. There is a quote from a Jane Austen novel at the beginning of the book which helped put me in the mindset of the mid to late 1800's. I was happy with that until the telephone rang. <br />Anyway, the first part is long on prose and short on plot until page 90 (or the start of Chapter 9, Part 1). In fact the author himself in Part 3 chooses to describe the writing in Part 1 as &quot;Simply put, you [it] need the backbone of a story. ... the prose [is] 'too full, too cloying' but with 'redeeming shades of Dusty Answer'.&quot;. (You'll have to read the book to learn why the author chooses to comment on his own writing.) At this point in Part 1 I wasn't really involved with the characters so I didn't care too much about the plot. But it got better, much better. And well worth the read.<br />HOWEVER, I would like to recommend to a person who has not read this book, NOT to read it from front to back. Instead I think this story would be much better told jumping into Part 2 (don't worry that the first 5 pages keep referring to the main character as &quot;he&quot; and you don't know his name for a while. Reading it sequentially wouldn't have helped!).  In the middle of Part 2 the character reflects in his distant past. It is at this point you should stop reading Part 2 (at page 220 in the Hardcover edition. For those of you with paperback, start reading Part 1 just before the major paragraph break where the paragraph starts with &quot;There was more confusion ahead...&quot;.). At this point go back and read all of Part 1 to give you some additional background information that will probably be more relavent and meaningful than someone who read Part 1 first.  Once you finish with Part 1, continue where you left off in Part 2 (page 220) and read to the end of the book.  So basically we are just inserting a major flashback at an appropriate time in the story.<br />If you do decide to read it using the recommendation above, please post your thoughts as to whether you think it read well this way.
0452281881|5.0|Common sense tells us that it isn't advisable to do it's laughing out loud to yourself on the NY City public transportation system. While reading this book, I found myself unable to do anything during my commute to my job in advertising - and I couldn't put \\"e\\" down.<br />If you've ever worked for an ad agency, or media, PR or fashion oriented company, or known anyone who has, you'll immediately recognize the cast of ultra trendy, self-aggrandizing, self-centered and ultimately appalling characters in this most delightful and hysterical book. From the temp secretaries to the CEOs and everyone in between, you'll get a rollicking e-mail exchange between computer challenged, overpaid and under worked leeches who live on booze, drugs, cigarettes and beer and live to party at company (or supplier) expense - except for the token hippie.<br />Though based in a London ad agency during its pitch for the european arm of a US account, readers from all over the world are guaranteed to be laughing a host of stereotypes, including many outrageous, politically incorrect international jabs. <br />Don't miss this book - you'll find yourself returning to it when you're really in need of a laugh.
B000001ESP|5.0|&quot;Moving Pictures&quot; is one of the best rock albums ever made.  Every song on this album is wonderful.  From the famous hit &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; to &quot;Vital Signs&quot;, you'll play this CD over and over again.
1573229725|5.0|Fingersmith is like a Jane Austen novel - if Jane Austen was a prostitute.  This is a wonderful and spellbinding story.  I was pleasantly surprised, as the book was given to me and I had never heard of the author before.  The book slowly draws you in, until it becomes difficult to put down about half way through.  It is impossible to be quite sure who the villains are, or where the characters stand with each other at any moment.  The style of the book works well, with the narration switching between the two main characters.  While reading, part of me wanted to solve the mystery and part of me just wanted to let it unfold.
B000002U82|5.0|In my eyes, Dark Side of the Moon is one of those albums that never gets old. This album timeless. This is probably the best Floyd album. Only Wish You Were Here is as good as this album. <br />How can you start a review about an album that is perfect? I will probably mention what most people have said already but this album is just that good. I'm in college now and I first heard this album from a friend my sophomore year in high school. I listened to the album all the way through(which is the only way to listen to this album) and bought it as soon as possible. This album started a total infatuation with this band. I listened to their music for 2 years straight. <br />I don't have a favorite song because I love each and every song. The songwriting on this album is absolutely amazing. David Gimour and Roger Waters were the primary songwriters but Nick Mason and Richard Wright have their say as well. David Gilmour is in my top 5 of guitar greats. Songs like &quot;Time and &quot;Money&quot; feature some of his best work. <br />I'm not going to elaborate on the songs too much because this is a masterpiece. Dark Side of the Moon is one of the best selling albums ever. Dark Side was on the charts for 14 years, some 700 and some weeks after it was released in 1973. That's just ridiculous. This album is so special and is something that is discovered by new ears all the time. Buy this album, sit down and just listen to it all the way through. And yes......this album does flow with the Wizard Of Oz. Which is rather scary but cool at the same time. Pink Floyd created a masterwork that will live forever. Dark Side of the Moon has become a part of my life and will never be too far from me. Sheer musical brilliance.
B00000099Y|2.0|This is probably one of the most overrated albums of modern times. Tool are not bad musicians but they tend to make a mess of albums - and this is their biggest mess of their career. Of the 15 tracks only 8 are songs while the rest is senseless filler segments sandwiched in between songs. <br />Aenima actually starts well and the first songs show some progression from their debut. However the first filler starts on track 4 and here the album turns into an extremely difficult and frustrating experience. The other songs aren't as strong as you again struggle with more filler. Things pickup with &quot;jimmy&quot; and the title track before the entire album drowns in endless filler and noise.<br />Had Tool stuck to the no-nonsence format of their debut we may have had a good album.<br />Critics and fans will equate this to genious but these people are the first to be fooled by gimicks and concepts that often mask musical blandness. Many of them have a fairly limited exposure to    metal outside of the US mainstream. It may be of surprise to them that many European underground bands easily beat Tool musicaly and emotionaly. If you are interested then here is a short list:<br />Opeth<BR>Paradise Lost<BR>The Gathering<BR>Amorphis<BR>Anathema<BR>Tiamat
B000002P5R|5.0|The onslaught of rip offs after Hendrix' death has only now come to some close.  Many, and particularly Alan Douglas,  should be absolutely shamed that they falsely created music that they claimed was Hendrix' that really only represented, at best, pieces of session jams.  I will exclude from these comments Douglas' Rykodisc productions which do represent valid performances.  Surely much of what was created was necessary to meet unfullfilled contractual obligations, but there was still much profiteering going on.<br />With the release of First Rays,  there is finally some order brought to the incredible disorder.  While there was still work to be done, this CD goes out of its way to be the album that Hendrix intended.  The fact that Eddie Kramer is connected with this CD is of huge significance.  He better than anyone knows what Hendrix intended.  The liner notes describe what existed and what had to be done to create the album.<br />There are many musical directions here,  all of which are interesting in their own right.  There are many excellent songs that I've never heard before and there has been some very good remastering done.<br />A definite buy for anyone interested in Hendrix.
B00000099Y|2.0|This is probably one of the most overrated albums of modern times. Tool are not bad musicians but they tend to make a mess of albums - and this is their biggest mess of their career. Of the 15 tracks only 8 are songs while the rest is senseless filler segments sandwiched in between songs. <br />Aenima actually starts well and the first songs show some progression from their debut. However the first filler starts on track 4 and here the album turns into an extremely difficult and frustrating experience. The other songs aren't as strong as you again struggle with more filler. Things pickup with &quot;jimmy&quot; and the title track before the entire album drowns in endless filler and noise.<br />Had Tool stuck to the no-nonsence format of their debut we may have had a good album.<br />Critics and fans will equate this to genious but these people are the first to be fooled by gimicks and concepts that often mask musical blandness.
1568495110|5.0|1984, A Brave New World, and The Clockwork Orange make up the structure of what we call Satire on Society.  I have read this book twice and I still haven't picked up all the details that its pages hold.  The gruesom and horrific acts within its covers make the mind run and hide from the idea of its possible truth.  Alex, the protagonist and his droogs commit rape, theft, assult, and even murder for the pure pleasure in it.  Most of this is covered up using a type of slang known as Nadsat.  Although the slang is sometimes hard to understand, it can be picked up quickly.  After being caught and forced to reform to society's standards of living(\\"Ludivico's Technique\\"), he tells the readers at the end his dreams to start a family as a younger man.  <BR>    Like in Orwell's 1984, this book brings up the question, \\"Do we want a society where the price of prosperity is the loss of our cherished rights; freedom of speach, press, religion, and even thought?\\"  Read \\"The Clockwork Orange\\" and feel the terror, the mind provoking feeling of a world that could be.
6305692572|3.0|This film received no more than average response from Critics and audiences in 1994 and it is interesting to watch it a decade later to see how it holds up. There is no doubt in my mind that Meg Ryan wanted this role to contrast her &quot;America's Sweetheart&quot; image. Fresh off her perky roles in hits like &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and &quot;When Harry met Sally,&quot; the part of Alice Green is a super acting part for Ryan and she is up to the challenge. Andy Garcia, then on the cusp of mega-stardom (it never panned out, oddly enough) had to settle for the part of victimized, shut-out husband,but he makes the makes the most of it. So why do I only give this film 3 stars ? The problem is in the script. The story is full of holes and under-developed plot lines. Why did the writers not delve into Alice's failed first marriage, her relationship with her parents (we only discover that her father is an alcoholic in the film's final 5 minutes), or show the professional consequences of Alice's behavior. I suspect the Producers felt that Ryan and Garcia' s Star Power would carry this film but I was left with more questions than answers.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Wow, what an album.  Fits like a comfortable old shoe.  And that's most of the problem.  I have heard this material hundreds of times before, often with better vocalization and instrumentation.  <br />Norah Jones in many ways defines &quot;safe jazz&quot;.  Her musis is not at all bad.  It is easy to listen too and, as I suggested, inoffensive.  It is GREAT background music.  On the other hand it is not great foreground music.  If you are looking for something innovative, startling, groundbreaking, or exciting, this is not the place to look.  If you are looking for Sunday-afternoon-on-a-rainy-day-stay-in-and-read music it is just perfect.<br />There is a tip of the hat to Sarah Vaughn, to Nina Simone, to the incomprable Lady Day, but no more so than many other lounge acts I have seen and heard in my time.  Nothing here will startle you or jar your mood -- in that way it is quite good.  Her voice is fine, if not excellent, and her band is good, if not stellar.  <br />In fact this is probably the epitome of a 3-star review that I have ever run across.  It is good, but it is not incredible.  It is a bit dull, but it is far from awful.  Overall it is an album, one that many people will buy because it won an award and is terribly, terribly safe in a world with far too much Eminem and Suge Knight.  Curl up with it -- you will feel like you have curled up in a safe old sweater.  Just ignore a bit of mothball aroma that comes from storing most of the music from a long time ago.
B00007EL92|3.0|Is this merely the latest in a long line of Elvis rehashes?  Yes and no.  Almost all of the 90's Elvis Compilations were based on a theme (country songs, soundtracks, etc) and possessed at least one gimmick, usually in the form of at least one previously unheard alternate take.  The theme for this release?  All of Elvis' #1 hits from England and the U.S.  The gimmick?  All of the tracks have been remastered and remixed from the original studio masters for the first time for \\"modernized\\" sound quality.  <br />Various filters and compression techniques have been utilized to make the tracks sound brand new.  While there is a clarity to the sound that hasn't been there before, it's not so stunning that you need to chunk all of your other Elvis CDs into the trash can.  The \\"Masters\\" box sets of the 90's, after all, also possess stunning sound quality without the \\"modernization\\" of the sound.<br />For anybody who already has all of these tracks, this compilation may not really be worth the cash.  For everybody else, this will probably be a good introduction to the music of the King.  Now, let's talk about the DVD-Audio version...<br />First of all, why in the world are the tracks presented in reverse chronological order???  It's just a little bit jarring to hear \\"Crying in the Chapel\\" and \\"Devil in Disguise\\" immediately after \\"Suspicious Minds\\" and \\"In the Ghetto\\".  The \\"bonus\\" tracks are hardly worth the effort.  But the big deal is the sound.  Most of the tracks simply do not benefit much from the 5.1 mix due to the fact that most of these tracks were recorded in either mono or on 3-track setups.  Naturally, though, the later tracks (the first 6 tracks on the DVD-Audio release)benefit greatly from the new mixes.  \\"Suspicious Minds\\" and \\"In the Ghetto\\" in particular sound stunning in 5.1.<br />In the end, however, this DVD-Audio, which has NO special features by the way, is simply not worth the hefty price tag.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is arguably the best album of Iron Maiden's career (with the possible exception of \\"Number of the Beast\\"). After more than twenty years together, and several line-up changes, the most popular line-up (Dickenson, Harris, Smith, Murray, McBrain and, as a special bonus, Jannick Gers) is back and better than ever. <br />This is still the heavy metal that we come to expect from Iron Maiden. They have not mellowed or sold out like SOME bands I could mention *cough*Metallica*cough* who have been around about as long.<br />The piercing voice of Bruce (my vote for greatest male vocalist of all time), the pounding thunder of the rythm section of Steve and Nicko, and the aggressive, now TRIPLE attack of guitarist Dave, Adrian and Jannick bring the drama of the old school metal assault back to the forefront of public consciousness.<br />My Favorite Tracks: \\"The Wicker Man\\", \\"The Ghost of the Navigator\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"Blood Brothers\\", \\"The Mercenary\\", \\"Dream of Mirrors\\", \\"Fallen Angel\\", \\"The Nomad\\", \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\"!<br />My Least Favorite Tracks: None.<br />This is a cd I can play over and over again, in the car, at home, or in the office, and listen to the best of the best that Iron Maiden has to offer!
B00006RINF|5.0|there is a shortage of women in the heavy metal industry these days and it brings me much pleasure to find this recent disc of lacuna coil. although the album is more of a pop goth with touches of metal, i think this album could please fans in the metal world too. let me first say that our lead female here has a very beautiful voice and her ethereal vocals compliment the male consort here who usually tends to sound a bit more gruff. lacuna coil will most likely never receive much attention from the mainstream audience or music buyers but probability suggests will remain an underground favorite for some time to come. it would be interesting to see what their future endeavors shall bring to the forefront of metal or goth and i intend to purchase their other albums in the near future as well. although i have my favorite tracks here as with any album, it is essential to hear the album all the way through for the first several plays before hitting the repeat button on your player for those favorite tracks. i can only hope that somewhere out there lacuna coil will get the play it deserves and develop the following which i feel is also greatly deserved. needless to say, i've enjoyed this album tremendously in the past so many days.
B000002JS6|5.0|Anything Good you hear about this album is true. released more than 20 years ago, it has stould the test of time. Every track kicks major ... The cd begins with the ringing of \\"Hells Bells\\". The heavy guitars and screaching vocals are truly amazing. Songs Like \\"Shoot To Thrill\\",\\"Shake A Leg\\", and \\"Have A Grink On Me make the disc great. However, \\"Back In Black\\",\\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\",\\"Hells Bells\\", and \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" make it legendary. This is without doubt the best album of all time!
006092988X|5.0|This book is a great book for anyone to read. Most people can realte to something in this book ranging from low income, to love, to death. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn put you in the place of Francie Nolan and takes you through a life that you never thought you could live. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B00006950W|1.0|You would be hard pressed to find someone more fanatic about zombie movies than myself, but there is a limit. That limit is called \\"Resident Evil\\". Awful acting, horrible writing, meaningless techno music and a poor storyline make up the hellish experience of sitting through this film. Apparently the filmmakers, the crew, and the writers never picked up a controller and actually played the game. The film is NOTHING like any of the Resident Evil games. Like most recent films, Resident Evil was made to draw in a younger audience, or any audience that would pay for that matter, not necessarily to make a \\"good\\" film. A supermodel was hired to play the leading role, rather than a professional actress; her acting is awful. This movie symbolized to me, everything that a zombie movie shouldn't be - Big budget, \\"modern\\" (techno music, computer graphics, unrealistic kung fu performed by a person that hasn't ever even taken a class in any form of kung fu, etc.). Basically, the newest member of my favorite genre (zombie horror) is one of my least favorite movies ever. Please, don't buy this movie. It seriously is in contention for the \\"worst movie ever\\" award. Consider yourself warned.
B000069HK2|5.0|There are a lot of Emo bands out there now, especially with the explosion of popularity the genre's seen. Anyone who knows Emo will undoubtably heard Finch, Thursday, Taking Back Sunday and so on; well, The Used is a little different. Their music seems better put together: the music can be intense at times or it can be powerfully uplifting depending on the need to the song; the lyrics are all well thought out and powerful, like an Emo band's lyrics should be (emotion requires something serious that is clearly communicated); and their emotionally outbursts are placed perfectly within all the songs.<br />     Bands like Thursday are great, but somehow their outbursts of emotion seem random, and the screaming just doesn't seem like it's in the right place (listen to &quot;Paris in Flames&quot;: a great song, but the screaming is put so randomly in the song it doesn't feel right). The Used nail this: They have the perfect combination of melodic singing with emotionally charged screaming thrown in right when the mood necessitates it. Their use of screaming and melodic singing is far better than any other Emo band's and is one aspect that distinguishes them so much.<br />     Their music also distinguishes them. They are more varied than, say, Taking Back Sunday, whose songs are great but seem very similar to each other. The Used do an excellent job of mixing things up. Some songs have a feeling of transcendence that can simply elevate the listener to a new level (like 2 minutes into &quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot;). There are a lot of places where the music just makes you forget about anything else and just live in the music.<br />     &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; is the perfect way to start of this CD. This is simply an amazing song: the emotion, the screaming, the experience; this tells the story of the rest of the CD. &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; is a little more &quot;poppy&quot; than some of the other songs, but remains a stand-out track. &quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot; is simply amazing with music that combines with outstanding emotion in the lyrics to bring about a song that just wows the listener. &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; is the song many people hear randomly and it gives a good sense of The Used, though I do not think it's the best song on the CD. There are a few songs--perhaps 2--that I don't really find to be as good, including &quot;Greener with the Scenery&quot; and &quot;Say Days Ago.&quot; Beyond this though, this CD is simply amazing.<BR>    <BR>     Any Emo fan must buy this CD. It will no doubt become a favorite of yours, especially if you like any other Emo bands. This is a must buy.

B00005NKKY|5.0|This album took me by surprise.  From the energy-driven opening song through the rest of the tracks, I could hardly tell where one stopped and the next started.  This is not to say that all the songs sound alike, or even similar, but that they all carry the same feeling...the same masterful approach in writing, the same bittersweet nostalgia, the same quiet optimism.  This is a masterpiece for listeners of all ages, who respect beautiful lyrics, perfect timing, sweet melodies, and just plain old good songs.  I am sold.  Here we have one of the best songwriters of our time playing true to style in some of his best work ever.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Having read Tolkien's Lord of the Rings more than 30 times (and dozens of times his other works), I note that Peter Jackson joins nearly every \\"Two Towers\\" reader in the same mistake:  one tower is indeed Saruman's Orthanc, however the other is NOT Sauron's Barad-dur, but is rather the guard tower (containing Shelob's lair) above the Morgul pass, which is not even addressed in the second installment of Jackson's epic movie endeavor.  That said, the \\"LOTR: The Two Towers\\" movie is still a mighty and overwhelming experience--leaving the theater I could scarcely catch my breath.  <br />At the end of \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" two groups of characters were separated by the great River Anduin.  Tolkien's second volume dealt with the conquests of the two Towers as separate books, only fleetingly referring to simultaneous events.  Peter Jackson utilizes film's ability to intertwine events, yet his differing treatment on each side of the Anduin gives us a greater appreciation of the two separate quests and the importance of each.<br />Though not following the book as carefully as some would hope, the movie builds anticipation for the showdown with the first Tower, Orthanc, and at Helm's Deep, Jackson truly captures the horror Tolkien felt about war, then takes it to a higher level by brilliantly insinuating the Elves of Lorien (not remotely connected to that battle in Tolkien's book).  Especially keep an eye on the Elf Haldir for an extraordinary acting moment, where, more fully than Jackson or Tolkien do through Arwen, the essential difference between Elves and mortal Men is hauntingly illuminated. <br />On the Mordor side of the river, Frodo and Sam meet and subdue Gollum who agrees to lead them into Mordor.  Peter Jackson and the Andy Serkis characterization of Gollum shows us, more convincingly than through Frodo and the Eye, the evil and anguish of the One Ring--even the ending song breaks your heart while making your skin crawl.  In another glaring divergence from Tolkien's book, the character Faramir forces Frodo, Sam and Gollum to accompany he and his men into battle, but then Peter Jackson uses this scenario to remind us that courage is more than strength in arms and determination more than brute force.  Though the movie ends with them not yet having conquered the second Tower, Frodo and Sam emerge as victorious as those on the other side of Anduin.<br />Peter Jackson uses the basic storyline of the second volume of Tolkien's trilogy and creates a marvelous visual interpretation of the grandiose adventure begun in \\"Fellowship of the Ring.\\"  More importantly, Jackson's \\"LOTR: The Two Towers\\" takes us to new heights of terror, new depths of despair, and new breadths of understanding.  It is not to be missed.
B00006FDCD|4.0|I think that before you buy this movie, you should understand that it is fairly old, and made for TV, which automatically knocks the rating down.  <br />I have seen a fair amount of made-for-TV-movies, but this one is by far the best out of all of them.  Not because it has scary special effects, or suspensful moments.  It is because of the concept.  Imagine for a moment that there really was a clown that could transform itself into your worst nightmares, and what's worse, only you can see it.  If you can picture that, then you have found what makes this movie horror.  It is not because of gore or suspense, but when you are up at 3 AM, delirious from lack of sleep, and staring around your dark bedroom all alone, you will find that the movie was much scarier then when you were watching IT.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Dont listen to people who say this movie is strange or something like that. It is a masterpiece and the Soundtrack/Original motion picture score is one of the best I have ever heard. Great Ryan Phillipe and Sarah Michelle Gellar!
0316666343|1.0|I agree with others who find the premise of the book interesting.  However, I couldn't help thinking while reading this book that the author was creating the story line as she went along.  In my opinion the plot is quite haphazard, with arbitrary meaningless subplots, pointless plot contrivances, and no real sense of closure at the end.  If it's meant to be a prolonged &quot;slice of life&quot; type of story, then it's not a very good one.  I forced myself to listen to the entire book in the hopes of discovering the magic which is keeping it on the bestseller lists.  A complete letdown.
0920668372|1.0|Sad, scary, creepy.  I can't believe it's so popular and that everybody doesn't have a problem with this dysfunctional mother/child relationship.  The mother's actions are inappropriate and invasive and it is not surprising that once her son has reached adulthood, he has a child but, seems not to have a wife.  Spooky drawings of the mother crawling around, too.  Lastly, it's sad when the adoring mother is too old & sick to stalk her son.  Overall, one of the wierdest & worst.
B000021XS0|5.0|I picked my first Dream Theater album up 6 years ago after my uncle suggested buying &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; after dicussing Rush's great albums. He told me &quot;If you like Rush, there's a very good chance you will like these guys&quot;. He was right I picked it up and I loved it. By the time &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot; was about to be released, I was hooked on DT. I had never been so excited about a CD release date in my life. I thought for sure it couldn't live up to the hype I had made it out to be...I was wrong.<BR>This is simply the greatest album of all-time. And I don't believe the way the music world is going, that that will chance anytime soon. You have peak performances from 5 guys who are at the top of the list at their instruments. You have the BEST story ever written into an album (and that's saying a lot).<BR>No matter how many times I listen to this album, it never gets old. I feel as if I'm listening to it for the first time again. This is musical brilliance at it's finest. I'd give 10 stars if I could.
B00005JLS0|5.0|This movie is great if you like Hugh Grant and his fun-loving charm. He works great with Sandra Bullock, a great match.
0671004107|5.0|Truly Carl Sagan's masterwork of fiction, &lt;u&gt;Contact&lt;/u&gt; somehow introduces several infinitely complex themes-- the conflict between science and religion, the awe-inspiring magnitude and complexity of the universe, and a plethora of political, social, and religious commentary-- and a great depth of information and analysis of each, yet remains entirely readable. A reader fortunate enough to read this book untainted by the terrible film version will find it both deeply provocative and thoughtfully entertaining; one less lucky must forget all that occurs on the screen before he can properly enjoy the book. Overall, &lt;u&gt;Contact&lt;/u&gt; is an amazing piece of work and one which I will happily read many times over.
B000068TPN|5.0|I usually don't like many war films and films about Vietnam don't usually thrill me much, but this movie was wonderful and gripping.  Gibson turned in a great performance as the leader of a bunch of rag-tag troops holding down an vital enemy line.  The other characters were developed to the point that I actually felt their pain and especially the pain of the grieving widows back home.<BR>The action was fast paced and brutal with a startling reality to it.  This movie may help me begin to like war films, it is a great movie and should not be missed.

B00006J3WH|5.0|I love this CD!!  I have watched my tape of the original musical so many times, it is fading fast.  The music is wonderful, and while the singers may not all be professional grade, it is still fun to listen to.  I am on tenterhooks just waiting for the DVD to come out with all the details of making the musical.<BR>It is a crying shame that no one submitted Joss Whedon for an Emmy for the work that went into this musical as this is by far the most creative thing on TV in years.  Although everyone has bashed season six of Buffy, it's actually one of my favorites if for nothing else but the inclusion of this episode.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is so offbeat and funny.After purchasing this book, I read it cover to cover in one day. Refreshing change from the norm.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I've read over the reviews given here, after having viewed my own copy of this DVD, and must agree with all of you.  This version is really stunningly fine, and a must-buy for anyone at all interested in the history of film, and in quality cinema in general.<br /><br />My first experience of Metropolis was seeing the usual truncated version in a little community cinema in San Francisco some 23 years ago.  The musical accompaniment was improvised brilliantly on the piano by an old friend of mine who had seen the original film in Germany as a teenager!  It was an unforgettable experience.  I especially remember as I greeted him at half-time him saying (probably about the actor who played Freder), \\"oh, that one actor is a real Westphalian ham!  It's really hard to keep up with him!\\"<br /><br />Anyway... this restored version is a great revelation for me.  As a composer myself, and one who has been studying silent film music lately, seeing this film restored with the music originally written for it is hugely rewarding.  The score is well-written, and perfectly carries across the film-maker's intentions, in a style in keeping with that of the film.  It is a model of good silent-film music, worthy of study.  It points up all the more how problematic it is when silents are released without proper music (e.g. the DVD of Eisenstein's \\"Battleship Potemkin\\", with a bunch of spliced-together extracts of Shostokovitch symphonies:  fine music, but often incongruous with the film;  a CD now exists of the original music by Edmund Meisel -- when will someone finally match this with the movie for a true restoration?).<br /><br />Besides the music, the visual restoration is truly magnificent, often breathtaking in its beauty.  Would that all great silent films could get this treatment (but the cost would be astronomical)!<br /><br />As to speed:  actually, there's reference in the DVD (or its booklet, I forget) to the original speed being 25 frames-per-second, which is pretty close tothe modern 24 fps.  But the action does sometimes look a little frantic, so I wonder about the 20 fps theory...  If so, that's about the only flaw in this production.<br /><br />Again, a must-buy!

B00005OAIE|5.0|this is one of the best cd's i've bought in a LONG time. Its one of those rare gems that you can listen to all the way through without skipping over a song. his lyrics are amazing, his voice is beautiful and soothing. just the imagery in his words are a demonstration of the abyss of talent that he holds. GREAT cd! COMPLETELY worth it.
B00006JDS4|5.0|First off I do consider 'I Spit On Your Grave' aka-'Day Of The Woman' which I do actually prefere as the title, a cult classic. Some may just happen to hire and view the film by chance and laugh through it at some of the rapes and especially Jennifer's revenge on each rapist, but what I see and understand with each viewing is that as I interpret it, that it has an important message throughout out it, and in each scene. I really like this film, and I know in saying that, that it can be confusing for other people to understand that especially if they don't like or deeply understand the film as I do. I think it's a important film out there in the world and that it really says something if analised and watching each performance carefully. The beautiful Camille Keaton did a wonderful,honest,brave, spellbinding, mesmerising job as Jennifer Hills.The other actors who played the rapists were very good in their roles and pulled it off convincinly. One day while watching 'I Spit', my brother watched some of it and commented that the actors who were the rapists were crap. I believe that, that wasn't the case, it was just that they did such a convincing job that it somehow does affect the viewer. 'I Spit': Millennium Edition is worth the buy, the 2 commentaries are very informative. The Joe Bob Briggs one is excellent and I learnt quiet a lot, The Meir Zarchi one is good and more informative about some of the behind the scenes stuff, and it's very interesting to hear Meir tell his sad tale about a real rape that happened which in spired him to write 'I Spit'. The only thing I was disappointed about was that there wasn't any cast interviews. But all in all a great buy.
B000001Y2U|4.0|I brought this CD cause &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; is a great song.  The album is good, but Manson doesn't sing very well in this album.  The voice is more clear in Mechinical Animals and HolyWood. Portrait of an American Family is supposedly his best CD, but I never brought it.  Still I would recommend Holywood and The Last Tour on Earth.
B0000683U7|5.0|I just watched my new DVD copy of North by Northwest.  I already own it on CED video disc and VHS, but was intrigued by the extras that come in this collector's set.  The picture and sound quality is nothing short of excellent. <BR> <BR>My only complaint is the disappointing commentary that you can choose to run while watching the DVD.  Having found that the commentary by Maureen O'Hara on the DVD &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; greatly enhanced my appreciation of that picture, I expected similar on the DVD of North by Northwest. In this case the commentary was provided by the scriptwriter, Ernest Lehman.  Unlike the Maureen O'Hara commentary it is rambling and often has little to do with the scene currently on-screen, detracting from the scene.  Very disappointing that Eva Marie Saint did not provide the commentary, especially since she did narrate an interesting documentary about this film that is also included on the disc.  <br />My advice is to skip the commentary and enjoy the film with the original sound track as well as the documentary and original movie trailers.  Well worth buying.
B000002KE2|5.0|I have the first five CDs of Black Sabbath with Ozzy as the singer. This is the best one out of them.<BR>It's heavy and active. They also have some slow dark sounds to add a beautiful chill in the atmosphere.<BR>I also love the lyrics in this album as well.<BR>This is the album where Ozzy gets athiestic so that's what I love about it.<BR>Even though Ozzy is a catholic christian or whatever. <BR>Satan loves us all.<br />I recommend this album simply because it is their best work with Ozzy along with the other four that I have.
0684800713|5.0|I read this book and it made me fatasize about knowing the wonderful mind it's words were written from.  I absolutley feel in love with Hemingway's style and work.  I felt as if he were &quot;talking&quot; to me.  The book is written in such a way that it makes you feel as if you are sitting in front of this interresting young man hearing of his day.  It made me want to read more of his works and  to read more of his life.  I only wish the world were small enough for Hemingway's in our day in time.
B000002H33|5.0|Battery - Starts out with acoustics and then automatically does the same acoustic melody only HEAVIER. Fast paced song; Could be longer...<br />Master of Puppets - Not that good, but it has a nice ending and dark atmosphere to it.<br />The Thing That Should Not Be - Pretty much the worst song on the album.  You can get bored of it very easily.  Never put this song on repeat <br />Sanitarium - Gets better at the end, but has a very sad yet clever beginning.<br />Disposable Heroes - Great Lyrics; Best song on the CD besides track 6 and 8.  I believe Hetfield describes the life of our American soldiers who served this country as slaves for our freedom and they really get jack off of it.<br />Leper Messiah - I hate christ. Doesn't everybody? I can't stand people still talking about a sissy who died such a long time ago. Hetfield describes how poliTRICKSTERS, such as priests, decieve the people into giving money so they can up to \\"heaven\\".  Yeah, right.  And pigs can fly!<br />Orion - Instrumental, this is actually worse than Track 3.<br />Damage Inc. - Beautiful Finish!
B00000IQW0|3.0|I gave it three stars because it is rumored that the widescreen version is fake. The black bars are just placed there for effect and it isn't the true widescreen format. I love Galactica and can't wait for the DVDs to the series to be released for purchase. Right now however this is all we have unless they come up with a special edition DVD with interviews with the surviving cast. The best episodes were the ones with the late Lloyd Bridges as Commander Cain titled The Living Legend.
B000006TRV|5.0|If you like acid rock and rock n' roll, then you have to get this album! <BR>Roger describes society and how it functions. Many of these functions are not seen by the people and were not even spoken of. <BR>It's a very funky album yet dark too. Some lyrics may even sound suicidal and homicidal....hehehehehe. YOU GOT TO LOVE IT!
B000002J1U|5.0|Ummmm....well, yes it can; but not too much. This album gives me goosebumps. As a review before me said, it is very, very under-rated. Not many people see Led Zeppelin III as their best (I dont), but it is close. Any true Zeppelin fan (that is, that listens to songs that aren't on Zeppelin IV) can say that this album is brilliant. &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; sets the bar, and luckily, EVERY song after it keeps the bar from ever going down. Now, if you have ever heard, or wanted to hear, one of the greatest songs ever to be recorded, all you have to do is put on <BR>Track 04 of this album. &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; IS perfection. This shows the true range of the greatest lead singer rock has ever seen. Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Bonhnam, and John Paul Jones, are at their most creative and ground-breaking. Don't pass this album up. It will pay you back in an exponential fashion.<BR>                                 Your's Truly,<BR>                                   LedZepFan
B00005UEAR|5.0|As Satanic as I am, I still give tons of credit to these guys. They make their relgion seem interesting for the first time. Their creativity with sounds and changing of beats is truly remarkable. They are the Pink Floys of Metal.<BR>I recommend this to anybody who loves Pink Floyd and Heavy Metal.
B00005JL96|5.0|This movie is just fantastic, from it's wonderfully unique look, it's GREAT soundtrack (Disney's best!Elvis is still the King!), and it's uplifting message of \\"ohana\\", a Hawaiian word meaning \\"family, or,no one is left behind or forgotten\\"!! I suggest parents pay close attention to the rating(PG) because little ones below the age of 6 may think acting like Stitch before he finds a family and happiness would be a good idea (it wouldn't be, though he is darned FUNNY when he's bad, as well as when he's good). Lilo is a very sweet but lonely little girl and acts out occasionally. which is understandable, because she misses her parents ( they passed away in a car accident which is referred to, not shown, in a very tender and sweet scene).She is being raised by her older sister, and is incredibly endearing and lovable!!!She and Stitch find their way to better behavior through love of each other and their \\"broken but still good\\" family. The end is very uplifting and leaves the wonderful message of \\"ohana\\" for familes of all kinds and sizes. A must see!!!
B00005K9LK|5.0|Great Album<BR>Every song is good including the instrumental intro<br />Hellion - Instrumental and the guitars sound phenominal(if that's how you spell it)<br />Electric Eye - Great Song; sounds futuristic; lyrics are funny.<br />Riding the Wind - Ehhh. It's good. It sounds like Dio's song \\"Gypsy\\", but Priest made it first. Altough Dio's Gypsy sounds better. <br />Bloodstone - Good song; Not the best song, but not the worst.<br />Chains - Great song; \\"TAKE THESE CHAINS OFF! Take them off of my heart.\\" His voice sounds like Ozzy in the chorus.<br />Pain & Pleasure - \\"She brings me.....PAIN!!!...but she gives me pleasure, don't know what I like.\\" Good song; slow, but very good.<br />Screaming for Vengeance - Very active; Halford screams into the mic in the beginning of the song and off we go to another rocking song by Judas Priest.<br />Another Thing Coming - A memorable hit; Probably the best song on this CD.<br />Fever - One of the best songs on this track; It gets stuck in your head very easily.<br />Devil's Child - Another great song; In this song, Rob Halford sings about his encounter with me.<br />Bonus Tracks:<br />Prisoner of Your Eyes - Very melodic; Nicely done; Sad, but beautiful; This is probably my favorite song on the whole CD.<br />Devil's Child (Live) - Same thing with Rob's encounter with Yours Truly. This time it's live which makes it more exciting and his voice doesn't EXACTLY go like it does in track 10.
0316286850|5.0|Because Aucoin is not tied to any specific company, this book does not limit the reader by recommending products that are currently in fashion or on department store stands.     For his myriad styles, Aucoin will merely identify \\"light flesh-coloured lip pencil\\", or \\"liquid black eyeliner\\". No brand names - yippee! Thus it tremendously increases your awareness of products and the standbys and treats that you'll need in your artillery to achieve the looks you want, whether on yourself or on others.    Aucoin begins by analysing each facial feature. He explains the techniques of applying foundation, blush, eyeliner, eyeshadow, lipliner, lipstick - even eyebrow pencil (telling you to make a \\"box\\" at the inside corner - hello, Ava Gardner!). Very clever, very helpful.    In his analysis of brushes, Aucoin does not plus any particular company. But he does explain what different brushes do, and you can therefore conclude for yourself which of them you'll need.  (Best to go to a theatre make-up shop, where you'll usually get objective advice.)    The illustrations and \\"types\\" of look are wonderful and really extend one's range and comprehension.     A generous, goal-oriented classic.
B00005JK8K|1.0|Useless, rethoric &amp; without plot.<BR>Badly directed and cut. <br />Waste of time.
B000068UXF|5.0|Beautiful videography, intense performances, a superbly crafted performance of a superb opera!
B00000IPAX|4.0|What's better than 1995 Blink but worse then 1997 Blink?No, it's not Greenday.Instead it's 1999's &quot;Enema of the State&quot;.Widely acclaimed as the best Blink 182 album,&quot;Enema of the State&quot; is horrendously pop-punk,like Bowling for Soup and Good Charlotte is.(though the latter would hate to admit it)<br />Everyone's heard the Blink 182 sell-out stories,and,if it's true then it's here that it began.And yet despite loathing the poppy production of the album with a passion,I find it hard to dislike &quot;Enema of the State&quot; because of the simple fact that it has some truly brilliant songs on it.All twelve songs are of excellent quality,and while &quot;All the Small Things&quot; and &quot;What's my Age Again?&quot; have been so cruelly overplayed,they fit into the album set so well you hardly notice the amount of radio plays you've heard of them.These stand alongside the quite brilliant &quot;Wendy Clear&quot; and &quot;Adam's Song&quot; and the overtly excellent &quot;Going Away to College&quot;.<br />But I still have some major gripes,the main one being that it took approximatley two hours to learn the entire album on guitar.Although the songs sound nice,they have a real lack of substance,and it is here that shows that an extra guitarist would do Blink the world of good.Also, the album is too clean-cut,and lacks the raw feel of previous Blink releases.So,&quot;Enema of the State&quot; makes compulsive,if flawed,listening.Thus,after weighing up the fors and againsts,I have to award this 4 stars.(but only just)If the scoring system was out 10 then I would award the album 7.5/10.But it's not,so I won't.
B0000027RL|4.0|this cd is one of the best of the early 90's. it has great songs on it such as jeremy, alive, once, even flow and why go. this CD was PJ's first, and became very popular a year after it was first released. this is a great CD and i highly reccomend it to anyone who likes AIC, nirvana, or soundgarden.
0060930187|5.0|This book was very interesting, and a good insight.I must admit, when I first started to read this book, I Found it difficult to understand somewhat. It seems as if the charactor falls into a point in her life, and you don't even see it coming. The things that you read may seem disturbing, but you can't help but read more. I recomend this book strongly. Pay close attention-the story changes in a blink of the eye.
B000002JS6|4.0|i honestly am not a big ac/dc fan. i never really like them that much, but i like this CD. it has some great songs like Hells Bells, Back in Black, Rock and roll aint noise pollution, and you shook me all night long. what do you do for the money honey is also a great song, but not as good as the others. order this CD if you like good music
B00005JLF5|5.0|My wife and I have both felt an emptiness since Deep Space Nine went off the air. DS9 was simply the most compelling, fascinating, adventerous, risky, unpredictable, best written, best acted, and best directed Star Trek of them all. During its last three seasons it was among the highest quality television programs -- right up there with Homicide: Life on the Streets. Once it really it its stride in the third season, each episode of DS9 played like a fine movie -- certainly far better than any Star Trek motion picture (except, perhaps, number IV).<br />And to top it off, it had a captain (yes, Commander Sisko does become a captain -- and even more at the end) who should record an album. We had the pleasure of seeing Avery Brooks perform his one man show of Paul Robeson during the centennial celebration of Robeson's birth. Brooks can sing with the best of them (as he also demonstrates on DS9). No surprise -- he is on the faculty of the drama school at Rutgers University. When DS9 started, you may have thought of him as \\"The Hawk\\" from \\"Spenser for Hire.\\" But long before DS9 was prematurely terminated, he made Sisko his own and established one of the great presences in any sci-fi television or film. Now if only Paramount would wake up and produce a DS9 movie that picks up where the series left off....
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is the greatest hip hop album hands down. <BR>I have 6 2pac albums, and this is the best. He has slow, emotional songs like &quot;Life goes on&quot; and &quot;I ain't mad at cha&quot;, f party songs like &quot;Check out time&quot; and &quot;All about U&quot; and classics like &quot;California Love&quot;, &quot;Picture me rollin'&quot; and &quot;2 of Amerikaz most wanted&quot;. There is only one song that I might even consider skipping- the rest are a pleasure to listen to. I have about 40 albums in my collection, and this is my favourite. If you have heard any 2pac song and liked it- GET THIS ALBUM
B00005JKZ3|3.0|Actually, that's not quite fair -- Tommy Lee Jones rises above the material he's been handed (mostly, anyway -- the &quot;I do the driving&quot; sequence isn't very funny and doesn't redound to his credit) and actually manages to make some of the shtick he has to do more than merely competently funny.<br />Will Smith, unfortunately, doesn't.  In fact, he fully lives down to the weak script.<br />In fact, films with Smith seem to play to the easy side of his characterisation -- the strutting blowhard who isn't nearly as competent -- or as funny -- as he likes to believe.<br />Add to that that this film is pretty much a rehash of the first, and that the basic McGuffin is instantly obvious to fans of either the Tom Baker-era &quot;Doctor Who&quot; or the fifth season of &quot;Buffy&quot;, and you have a recipe for a film that is fun to watch for the special effects, not particularly offensive, and i'm really glad i didn't pay for a ticket to see it.<br />On teevee, as is often the case, some of the special effects that probably looked Really Kewl up on the big screen come across as not particularly impressive, particularly some of the opening subway sequence.<br />The best thing on the DVD is a short feature entitled &quot;The Chubb Chubbs&quot; -- a shaggy dog story akin to the old joke about &quot;Big John's a-comin'!&quot;, in which a crummy bar on some cheesy planet is populated by characters like ET, Darth Vader, Robbie the Robot, the Robot from &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and so on.  ((Given the comic book origins of &quot;Men in Black&quot;, i found myself irresistibly reminded of a series entitled &quot;Tales from Munden's Bar&quot; that ran in the back of &quot;Grimjack&quot; years ago...))<br />If you haven't seen this film and you were thinking of doing so, my advice is to watch the first film again, instead.
B00000F566|3.0|I've just watched &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; for the very first time ever. I remember back in the days it was supposed to be hot! Well I was a bit dissappointed. Typical sleazy american love story, very little 'dirt' (if any) and okay dancing but great?! It's nothing like Saturday Night Fever or Dance With Me. This movie needed much more depth, wider story lines, more music and higher level choreography. Overall an okay movie for a sunday afternoon.
B000002GK1|5.0|Soundgarden was really on a roll when they released this, a masterpiece of hard rock. Because they were originally on the Sub Pop label and hailed from the Seattle area, these guys were originally lumped in with all the &quot;grunge&quot; bands like Mudhoney, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam. However, on this record, they prove that they transcend marketing labels, blending together influences as wide ranging as 70s metal/hard rock, 80s post-punk, and 90s miscellany. There is not a single weak song on this; the playing is superb; Cornell wails like a banshee. This is a brilliant record, one of the best overall rock records of the 90s. Highly recommended!
B000002UAR|5.0|Whether this is the best Beatles album or not is totally debatable, but the relevance of this album cannot be denied or overlooked. Revolver was the &quot;great leap forward&quot; in mainstream music, and even after its release in 1966, it still sounds just as revolutionary now. Instead of the pop songs about love that made up the early repetoire of their career, the Beatles added sitars, Bob Dylan's social commentary, tape loops, and pensive lyrics,and out came Revolver, probably the most influential LP of all time. Is it the greatest album of all time? To me, it's debatable, but one can make a very relevant case on why this would be the best album of all time. Just listen to songs like &quot;Taxman,&quot; &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; &quot;Love You To,&quot; &quot;She Said,&quot; &quot;For No One,&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows,&quot; and you will be transfixed by the remarkablity of the album, and how it turned rock from music for teenagers to dance to, to it being a dominant art form.
B0000640SA|5.0|I stayed away from this move for a long, long time. Due to mixed word of mouth, and personal tastes of movies. After viewing the two disc version I am gald I did. First and formost this is a very good film. It kept me thinking long after my first viewing.<br />Then, it was my friend who showed me something on the second disc that totaly blew my mind. How to unlock the film so it plays in cronological order. I like the packaging, the enigmatic menu selections (play around with the test on disc two for some very neat stuff). Well worth it.
B00005MP58|5.0|I loved the book and loved the movie.  The quality is great my friend that owns the VHS copy was amazed at how wonderful the picture was.  I sit in suspense til that last moment to see if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth will really get together.  I am a die hard fan of the book and this movie.  The only reason the movie is five plus hours long is that it grasps the whole essance of the movie every detail and line is not left out.  Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy was exellent all my friends are in love with him!  You won't be able to stop.
0060537639|5.0|Another reviewer claims to be a Chinese from Shanghai, China. Ok, well, I am actually an extraterrestrial from Neptune, and believe it or not, I find that the attitudes and behavior of the book's critics are ridiculous! Yes, of course, it's \\"neat\\", this ploy that anyone can claim another identity on the anonymous Internet in order to boost the credibility of his/her words. But let's be real. We all want to read honest, logical, and insightful reviews and critiques where we have come to expect on this page. Disguising yourself behind a thinly-veiled false identity is not the way to achieve this. To any intelligent observer, that reader's fluent use of American lingo and idioms certainly doesn't jive with his claim to be from Shanghai, China. There are good English-speakers from China, but you cannot be THAT good. The \\"great America\\" term is the only awkward part of your review, but don't you think that was a little too easy? You could've made a better disguise by subtly inserting more awkward phrases and grammatical mistakes. On top of that, your \\"review\\" contains no facts or logical reasoning, but only vitriolic attacks against the author. Do you think most people here are so dumb that they'll just buy into your pathetic identity trick? So like I said, if you call yourself a Chinese from Shanghai, China, then I can assure you that I'm a Neptunian from Neptune.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is the best album ever recorded
B000088E6D|2.0|I was very eager to hear this CD, but was very disappointed. Michael Buble does nothing new for these songs. It was like listening to a karaoke singer in a bar do these songs. I love this style of music, and would really look forward to NEW songs in this style being written and recorded by Michael Buble, but to do nothing more than sing the songs in the same style as the original doesn't warrant shelling out your hard earned bucks. I have my Sinatra, Sammmy, and Dean CD's, and if you have any of their CD's, skip this one. It's nothing more than a poor imitation.
B00006RCNW|5.0|What a show!The best Crime Show ever.Before there was Homicide<BR>or NYPD ,but now the Shield sets the Score higher.<BR>There is so much Junk on television today that this makes you believe in wonders.Great actors and high octane action.<BR>Buy it!
B00004RF9I|5.0|I saw Network when it was first released and will never forget it.<BR>We in the audience didn't know what to think.  The tv shows were so outlandish as to be fantastic.  We were sure nothing like the events of the movie could ever happen.  Boy, were we wrong!  No one today can see it as we saw it because it is everyday tv now.<br />The scene with Ned Beatty explaining that big business runs the country was laughable then.  Now I believe it.  If you have never seen Network sit back and enjoy the wonderful script.  I don't know why writing has taken a back seat in Hollywood, but this script is so enjoyable it is like a good meal.  Savor it.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is an amazing CD, very rarely am I able to find one that I can just listen all the way through without stopping at all. This CD accomplishes just that.<br />1.Dumpweed-9 1/2: This is great way to start out the CD, it has a really catchy chorus and an amazing guitar riff near the end.<BR>2.Don't Leave Me- 10: A great follow up to a great song. It's fast paced, the lyrics make sense, and it has a great chorus.<BR>3.Aliens Exist-7: Not my favorite song, but still has a really great beginning.<br />4.Going away to College-8: I don't particularly like this song because it's a little slow. It has some amazing lyrics though and a lot of people will really identify with it.<BR>5.What's my age again?-9: Another great song with a great guitar riff to start it out. Absolutely hilarios lyrics when you really listen to them.<BR>6.Dysentary Gary-11: The best song on the CD. Period. That's it. You have to listen to it to understand.<BR>7.Adams Song-7: A lot of people like this song, but I don't really. I can easily ignore it though, so I guess it's fine.<BR>8.All the small things-9: It's a good song, easy to get tired of though. The best part is \\"Late night, come home, work sucks!, I know\\"<BR>9.The Party Song-10: An amazing song, sort of a mix between punk and rap. A really good message here too.<BR>10.Mutt-9 1/2: I really love this song, it describes so many people.<BR>11.Wendy Clear-10: Another amazing song. Very Very well done.<BR>12.Anthem-10: The best ending to the CD I could think of. Amazing shorus, almost as good as \\"Dammit\\".
B00005K3LW|5.0|Despite the fact that many believe the first Die Hard film was the best of the series, I tend to disagree and I consider Die Hard With A Vengeance to hold that title.  John McClane (Bruce Willis) finds himself back in New York when a serial bomber (Jeremy Irons) begins terrorizing the city.  Soon McClane is sent on tedious suicide errands alongside a Harlem shopkeeper (Samuel L. Jackson) as a distraction while Irons and his brigade rob the gold from the Federal Reserve.  Director John McTiernan (who helmed the original but did not on Die Hard 2, that job went to Renny Harlin) returns and keeps the film packed with pure action and suspense.  Willis is as colorful as ever in the role that made him a household name, while Jackson is great as well and the two are great and comical as two reluctant partners.  Irons is at his villianous best, and next to Alan Rickman (whose character is the brother of Irons' character) he is the best villian in the series.  My only complaint about the film is, as the Amazon review states above, that there is quite a number of plot holes towards the last quarter of the film, but they can be easily ignored while you watch the ridiculously comic action sequences in awe.  All in all, Die Hard With A Vengeance is my favorite film of the Die Hard Trilogy, and is one of my favorite action films of all time.
B00005NZBN|5.0|Love and Theft is easily Bob Dylan's best CD in a long time.  I think a line from the song Mississippi sums this album up fairly well: \\"Things are starting to get interesting right about now.\\"  After almost forty years in the business, Dylan is still putting out some of the best music he has ever written and recorded.  It lacks the passion and underlying spirit of rebellion found in his early releases, but Love and Theft stands well above the vast majority of music being recorded these days.  In Summer Days, Dylan says that you can repeat the past, and in a way, that is what he has done here.  This Bob Dylan is a conglomeration of all the Bob Dylans that have come and gone for; drawing on varied aspects of his musical legacy, he manages to return to the basics while at the same time offering a fresh variety of sounds and musical approaches on these twelve tracks.<br />Mississippi would be my favorite song here; the manner of Dylan's extended delivery of incredible lyrics brings to mind classic songs such as Tangled Up in Blue.  If you like energetic, toe-tapping rockers, Dylan proves he won't be performing sitting down for many a year with Lonesome Day Blues and Cry a While, two songs also heavily tinged with the blues, as well as Honest With Me.  Summer Days is quite unusual, combining verifiable swing music with a strong pinch of rockabilly.  On High Water (for Charlie Patton), Dylan incorporates the banjo and also possibly the mandolin, while Floater (Too Much to Ask) seems to feature violin music that works especially well in the transitions.  I normally would not think of violins and Bob Dylan together, but the combination works fabulously.  Floater is also notable for its plucky rhythm and subtly humorous lyrics.  This album also features some slow, even poignant songs which I find it hard to describe.  I could actually imagine the songs Bye and Bye and Moonlight being sung by a Sammy Davis Jr. to the accompaniment of the incomparable Laurindo Almeida.  Po' Boy is another slow song, but it has a little stronger guitar playing pushing it along.  Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum gets this album off to a great start, and Sugar Baby, a reflective song about looking backwards at the past closes it out on a magical note.  The two extra songs included with the limited edition of this album are very nice and more than worth the added cost.  The 1963 alternate version of The Times They Are A-Changin' is crystal clear and a great song to have in your Bob Dylan collection.<br />Dylan's voice isn't what it used to be, but I find the distinguished, gravel-like nature of it quite enjoyable, especially on tracks featuring a good beat and forceful lyrics.  It can sound a little strained at times, but what we get in Love and Theft is the real Bob Dylan.  He seems to recognize his place in history, appreciating the great days of the past but charging ahead proudly into the future.  The music is what matters to him, and he presents it honestly and openly; the sense of comfort he seems to possess at this stage in his legendary career allows the words and music to emerge naturally, and I believe that is the secret of his unparalleled success.y is another slow song, but it has a little stronger guitar playing pushing it along.

B00004RFFS|5.0|This sprawling epic adaption of the Anne Rice classic may suffer from some slow pacing and direction, but the absolutely awesome performances from Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt make Interview With the Vampire a much better film than it could have been.  Cruise is simply magnificent as Lestat, the vampire who bites the grieving Louis (Pitt), and thus begins Lestat's formation of an immortal family.  Cruise shines like no one (not even Rice herself) could have imagined as Lestat.  Stuart Townshend has nothing on Cruise as Lestat as he carries the dark and seductive vampire trademark of the vampire, and this remains one of the best performances of his career.  Brad Pitt's portrayal of Louis conveys all the remorse and melancholy that goes along with anyone stricken with immortal bloodlust.  The rest of the cast includes a young Kirstin Dunst, Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea, and Christian Slater (in a role originally planned for River Phoenix, Slater replaced him after his untimely death), all of whom give great performances.  All in all, Interview With the Vampire is one of the finest horror films of the 90's, and the final shot of the film leading into Guns 'N Roses covering the Rolling Stones' \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\" while the credits are rolling is reason enough to give this a look.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I'm going to refrain from reviewing the actual series itself as so many others have done so well.  <br />Considering we're reviewing the DVD itself, I have to say Paramount improved upon itself tremendously since the TNG DVDs.  <br />First and foremost, the package is easy to handle.  The clear cover enwraps the main case.  Unlike TNG, where you had to unfold, unfold, unfold and drop something, the DS9 packaging opens like a book.  You don't have to unfold anything. <br />Also, TNG had that annoying insert with the cast picture which ALWAYS fell out when I opened the DVD box. Not in this case. <br />The special features are fantastic, especially the Section 31 hidden files.  Great touch. <br />DS9 is the most creative and original of the modern Trek series.  It seem the designers of this package caught it too. <br />Great job. Can't wait for more!
B000002AH9|5.0|it was a strange choice i seppose for somone who wants to get to know the basics of jazz music, but i got it a few years ago, cause i loved the way she looks on the cover, about a hundred CDs later jazz became my favorite kind of music and i still adore this CD, her voice here, is so obsorved in pain, she gives such a melancholy deep meaning to each word she sings, to me this became an example of the depth of understanding somone could give to words and tunes.<br />just thinking about it now makes me what to put this on, close my eyes and fly to a land of broken hearts and the sweetest kind of sadness
B00005JLXC|3.0|Very violent, too violent for me. It has way more violence than Blade or anything else I've seen.
B00000269G|4.0|One of the most famous and best-selling jazz records of the Fifties, and yet it has less-than-perfect sound quality and microphone placement. Garner was really &quot;on&quot; this particular night, however, and the man knew how to entertain. Accessible renditions of several of the &quot;pop&quot; tunes of the era, but each is packed with notes. The cover pic was one of the best photos ever used on a 12x12&quot; LP sleeve. The music just makes you feel good. The bass and drums do not get much time in the spotlight during this 40 minutes or so, but Garner could sure make one piano sound like two or three when he wanted. I used to listen to my brother-in-law's vinyl of this when I was in high school. It introduced me to jazz piano, a love I can't shake even though I cannot play myself. The CD version disappoints only in that the sound quality is still below current expectations, due to the original concert taping equipment, which was not of professional quality. The exuberance of this show, however, wins the day, just as it did for the LP release nearly 50 years ago.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you've never listened to this...then give it a listen and see what all the hype is about.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This album started as a bit of confusion for me.  When I bought it I expected it to go in yet another new direction as their previous albums have.  To give you an idea of where I'm coming from I believe that the bends was their greatest album yet.  Ok computer in my opinion was the labor pains involved in growing in a new more spacey direction while still in the afterglow of the great bends.  Kid A wake coming into stride in that new direction and amnesiac they fell like they are fully comfortable in their new vein.  I did not expect them to grap on to their new sound so comfortably which made this album a suprise for me.  Now that they've established themselves in this arena the sounds are more accesible and comfortable to listen to.  I predict another shift in Radiohead's sound after this or else (heaven forbid) their decline.  I do believe that radiohead is the best current talent in the popular (I hate using this word)music world.  Even if they quit now they would in my opinion be forever etched into annals of music greatness.  So as far as this albums pick it up because it is throughly well crafted album.  While KID A was a very good album it doesn't have the maturity of the songs on this album.  And I know what you may be thinking that these albums were recorded at same time but I do believe that radiohead understand the differing levels of art on these albums and organized them accordingly.
B000002LHT|5.0|Two reasons I give this 5 stars: to hopefully bring up the average review from 3 stars (cause it deserves better), and it was the first Ramones album I ever heard (after \\"Mania\\").  Maybe that distorts my perception somewhat, cause I listened to it every day on the school bus for about a year, but I think it's one of their best anyway, or at least it highlights all of their strengths.  \\"I Believe In Miracles\\" is one of their best songs & definitely a better anthem than \\"Something To Believe In\\".  \\"Zero Zero UFO\\", \\"Learn to Listen\\", & \\"Ignorance Is Bliss\\" are great short kick azz songs in the same way as \\"Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment\\", & \\"I'm Against It\\".  \\"Don't Bust My Chops\\" kind of annoys me, but it's at least as funny as \\"Somebody Put Something In My Drink\\".  \\"Punishment Fits The Crime\\" might be the most sophisticated song they ever wrote, & more proof that they were not d-u-m-b.  \\"All Screwed Up\\", \\"Can't Get You Outta My Mind\\", & \\"Come Back Baby\\" are prime examples of Joey's Phil Spector-simple love song obsession.  \\"Palisades Park\\" is my very favorite cover song of theirs (which is saying something).  & \\"Pet Semetary\\" is of course great, continueing their horror movie fixation a la \\"Chainsaw\\".<BR>    Maybe this album is too metallic.  Maybe one review I read somewhere was right in saying that they had become professional musicians by this point.  Maybe Dee Dee leaving soon had some effect (I'm Affected) on the recording.  But you know what, the Beatles knew \\"Abbey Road\\" would be their last one all together, & they made one of their best albums as well, really focussing on what they did best.
B00005JLF5|5.0|The often overlooked \\"middle-child\\" of the legacy that is the STAR TREK universe is about to take it's rightful place as the most significant and vital of all the STAR TREK series.  Already, in it's first season DS9 features some \\"stand out\\" episodes which exceed some of the expectations of any television fan -- especially a die-hard STAR TREK fan.<br />Sit back and take a journey that may have otherwise been lost on the airwaves, but will prove to have an entire new life in DVD format!
8408038818|5.0|It was the sensation of the year like the previous reviwer has ponited out and I wanted to buy it for an english frind but still there is no sign of it yet!!! WHY NOT??? This book could be a film easily and was the mouth to mouth book that surpassed any expectation!<br />The best book I have read last year, trully magic, from the beginning I could not put the book down till the end, I could even sleep, yes it's a cliche but what it's not a cliche it's this book.<br />It takes you to the magic of literature and the bond between father and son, not only you witness the grown up of a child but his love for books and why we need to look after them in times when other facts seem more important than read and learn about ourselves through someone else.<br />it's totally magic and enchnating wrapped up with a thiller that will keep you awake day after day.
B000002RXS|5.0|This is the perfect \\"Carmen\\". Callas has discovered the truth about the character. Carmen is NOT sexy! She is a gypsy and a fatalist, hence the powerful card scene. Whatever is in the cards must be dealt with and cannot be avoided, even though it be death. Also Carmen is the flame and we are all the moths. We must be careful not to get to close, or we get burned. Those who have seen the footage of Callas singing the \\"Habanera\\" will remember the body language that says, \\"Don't touch!\\" This is the secret of Carmen. Callas' interpretation is much closer to Merrimee than to Bizet. This is the real Carmen, RARELY seen or heard on today's operatic stage. The real tragedy is that Callas never put this opera on the stage.
B000000H3W|5.0|Arise is one of those albums that if you love metal this is a must have! It has a diabolic mood to it. Some of the songs like Dead Embryonic cells, and Altered State are classics. Ive owned this album for many years now and it never gets old or boring. Its to bad that Max didn't stick with Sepultura, I love his style of singing.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This album is the best thrash metal album of all time.  Period.  Puppets is a very close second.  The songs are not monotonous.  They do not all sound the same.  These are two common criticisms levelled at this CD by neophytes who have never bothered to listen to the CD more than three or four times.  There is so much going on at once that it is impossible to decipher and appreciate until you have given this CD a good ten listens.  Then, and only then, can your mind start to appreciate the brilliance of this CD.  The songs are unique, full of flavor, and easy to distinguish.  The lyrics are SUPPOSED to be a parody---Slayer is full of dark humor---so don't take it seriously coz they sure as hell don't!!  Do yourself a favor and get this immediately---all the five star reviewers are trying to tell you something about this gem of a recording...
0783225970|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever and is the best gangster movie ever in my opinion.  The picture quality on the DVD is pretty bad, but it still remains better than the VHS version.  The picture often looks fuzzy and kind of pixelated, but is the best that you can get for it.  The sound is good and works well with this movie.  This movie is such a great movie and many people have copied this movie or parts of it.  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is almost exactly like this movie and rightfully so.  Many people find the movie to be sick and gory, but in truth, it really isn't that gory.  Many people get mad because of a chainsaw scene, but you only see blood spray around.  There is little sexual activity.  The language in this movie is extreme.  You will often hear the f word at least once in a scene and there is often much more than one.  There is probably at least 200 times you hear a cuss word.  There is a lot of sexual dialogue too.  Even with all of this explicit material, this is such a wonderful movie.  It has some very suspenseful moments with plot twists and some great action.  The movie is Out Of Print(OOP) and the DVD is very nice.  I happened to find a real one off of ebay and I am very pleased with it.  The outtakes were alright with few funny moments.  I liked the cast and crew bios, the making of Scarface feature, but the best of all, is being able to watch this movie.  I really recommend that people buy this DVD, because DVDs will be the prime video format for at least ten more years probably.  It is also a great film and even if you don't like the film, you can have a wonderful DVD in your collection, or you could sell it to someone.  Get the movie and while you wave it in front of your friend, say \\"SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!\\" *BOOM*
B0000042MY|5.0|I've read the book, seen the movie and bought the sound track. The music captures the essence and grandeur of the story. It is at once tragic and heroic, melancholy and romatic, stark and awesome.<br />This is a piece of music that won't age. Everything is captured and frozen in the moments of battle and glory, loss and gain. It is a soundtrack you can keep going back to, and when no one is home you can crank up the speakers to a suitable volume.<br />Even if you don't care for the movie or want to read the book, the music is spectacular.
B00008HCCF|5.0|If you already have Norah's fantastic debut album, then this DVD should be next on your shopping list. Recorded at the House of Blues, Norah (and her band) gives an excellent and intimate performance. Fans will rejoice with the inclusion of some non-album tracks, including Comes love, Bessie Smith, Something is calling you, What am I to you?, and the concert encore Tennessee waltz. Along with these you get many of her much loved songs including the likes of the superlative Don't know why, Come away with me, One flight down and many more. It's a shame songs like Shoot the moon and Turn me on aren't here, but hey...you can't have everything.<br />Picture quality is excellent - very crisp, vibrant colors, and full screen. Sound is equally impressive. Unfortunately the DVD is a little low on extras; you get the aforementioned concert encore (though why this is separated away from the main concert is beyond me) and one music video, for \\"Come away with me\\". Why didn't they include some of her other videos though?. <br />Nevertheless, and minor criticisms aside, this is a great first DVD of one of the most promising new artists in years. If you love her debut album then there's no reason why you shouldn't love this as well.
B00000I07Q|5.0|You want to be blown away, do nothing more than buy this, so much variation, so much rock, a cultural masterpiece, Wild Is The Wind, Stick To Your Guns, Bad Medicine, Lay Your Hands On Me, I'll Be There For You, from Bon Jovi we can ask no more, but they keep on givin' check out all their other albums, this band is not Hair Metal, every shallow fool says they are, take a look and you'll see for yourself this is amazing Bon Jovi at their prime!!! Thank you rock and roll!
0385508417|4.0|A very quick read and delightful story.  Grisholm writes and entertaining story of a family that decides to forego Christmas and take a Cruise instead.  You can imagine what scenerio's come to fruition throughout this funny short story.<br />A cute ending that will instill the spirit of Christmas lasts forever.  I recommend.
B00006879E|3.0|it has some good beats...and lyrics are kool too. but this group gives me the feeling of a boy band more than a rock group...but alright
B000002ITK|4.0|I totally dig this album. I grew up listening to them since they come from my hometown. Granted they &quot;softened up &quot; alittle but it doesn't detract from what got them to the spot light. cause &quot; i'm an SMF &quot;
0312305060|3.0|I brought this book because I had heard great reviews from the movie.  I can't say the book was bad at all, especially because Cunnigham has an extremely unique style of writing. However, it did seem to work against him at times.  The book is descriptive and captures the raw emotions and thoughts of each character, but it is filled with paradoxes and can be quite boring to read.  I would recommend giving it a try, but clearly not a novel that many may enjoy.
B000053V7Q|4.0|This was fantastic! What I liked most is that there was no narration, no interviews, no nonsense, yet still somewhat a documentary.  They basically chronicle a Las Vegas show (though it's shot over 6 shows) by starting out with the rehearsals, the nervousness before taking the stage, and then the actual performance. The video transfer is very good and the sound is excellent.  They had the original 16-track master so they were able to create a DD soundtrack that actually has some depth to it. There is also a brief \\"making of\\" and some bio notes.  You get to see some of Elvis' personality which I had not seen before.
1565847032|5.0|Before reading this you might want to check out the DVD &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot;. Rent it from Netflix.com if you must or buy it here. It's a good intro. Then dip in deeper into this book. It is a collection of bits from various lectures over the years. The segments are short and informal, that is they are in spoken and not written form, which makes it easier to read. The books is composed of audience questions and his answers. You will learn  quite a bit. Don't make the mistake of thinking he is speaking of conspiracies. He's not, although sometimes the way he speaks makes it sound that way. It is an institutional analysis. That is, a description of the way things naturally unfold in the kind of political and economic system we live in. <BR>Chomsky is a gem.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This Album in a nutshell is a masterpiece with great songs like &quot;fight test&quot;, &quot;yoshimi Battles the pink robots part 1&quot; and &quot; Do You realize&quot;.
B00003Q43A|5.0|Movie:<BR> I don't know why I love this movie so much. I've seen it about 30 times, or so and I love it more every time. Although it can be corney at times,(i.e. the presidents speech), but it just makes it better. The special effects are great even by todays standards, much better than the soulless 98% computer generated \\"Star Wars: Episode 2.\\" I'll breifly outline the plot: Sometime in the near future, a massive spacecraft arrives at Earth. It breaks into several dozen other craft, each being 15 miles in diameter. They hover over all the major citys, and soon cause their destruction. And therefore, a band of American heros form, so on and so on. Excellent.<BR>Movie: 5 stars<br />DVD:<BR> The DVD is one of the best DVD's I own. It's menus are detailed, and 3D, in a sence. The picture and sound quality are great, and the extras are actully very interesting. Plus, you can choose the theatrical version, or the special edition version with 15 mins of extra scenes.

6304509154|5.0|\\"Poltergeist\\" is the result of an inspired pairing of Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg, who brought out a scary shocker of a horror movie.  It's the story of the Freeling family, living a solidly upper-middle-class life in a solidly upper-middle-income tract suburb that just happened to be built over a cemetery plot that houses the remains of some very disgruntled ghosts.  Funny things start happening, innocuous at first; remote TV signals get scrambled (the guys are sitting around watching the football game and find Fred Rogers singing \\"It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood\\" at them instead), then chairs start zipping around on their own and floating in the air, and it's all great fun for a little while.  But then the \\"TV people\\", as little Carol Anne calls the spectral figures that seem to inhabit the family Sony, get nasty, and Carol Anne is kidnapped and transported to an otherworldly dimension.  Time to call the neighborhood ghostbusters.  A trio of parapsychologists enter the premises from the local university, only to have the pants scared off them by the ghostly invaders.  An expert is needed, and arrives in the pint-sized form of Tangina, a medium who is more than a match for any old ghost.  Carol Anne is rescued, and the ghosts vanquished...or are they?  Papa Freeling wisely decides to get his family out of there, and calls in the movers, but unwisely, they decide to spend one last night in the house, and hoo-boy... turns out those ghosts were just biding their time.  The resulting shenanigans literally raise the roof.  Hooper knows how to work the horror to the max, and sometimes it gets not only hair-raising but stomach-churning (witness one of the trio tearing his face off over the bathroom sink) but ultimately we know it's all in fun.  The actors are very good indeed and the three Freeling children, played by Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins and Heather O'Rourke, are excellent.  But the biggest delight is Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina, a born ham if there ever was one.  \\"Poltergeist\\" has sense enough not to take itself too seriously; it's a delicious concoction of shivers and laughs all mixed up into one great fun package.re ever was one.  \\"Poltergeist\\" has sense enough not to take itself too seriously; it's a delicious concoction of shivers and laughs all mixed up into one great fun package.
0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.,is a self-described \\"trafficker in climaxes and thrills and characterization and wonderful dialogue and suspense and confrontations.\\" To this end, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five or the Children's Crusade: A Duty Dance With Death,\\" is a brilliant and outrageous antiwar book about the catastrophic World War II fire bombing of Dresden, Germany.<br />Vonnegut delivers serious messages coated in humor.  For instance, early in the narrative he states that there is \\"nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\"  And then adds, \\"I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee.\\" The author then drives his convictions home by clearly explaining, \\"I have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.\\"<br />This is a remarkable book.  Vonnegut expresses his antiwar outrage with blistering humor.  And by the way...Billy Pilgrim and the Tralfamadorians will leave you in stitches.  So it goes.<br />Bert Ruiz
0671027344|5.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is quite simply an amazing work of fiction. On reflection, words to describe this remarkable book come sparingly.<br />Told in the first person by \\"Charlie\\", \\"Wallflower\\" is at heart an honest book. Charlie is writing letters to an unidentified recipient because he's feeling overwhelmed with his life. He's starting high school. His sister is starting to act out. His brother is off to college. Quickly though, shy, sensitive Charlie is helped out of his emotional shell when he befriends two seniors, Patrick and Sam and the remainder of the novel chronicles the year they spend together.<br />There are several key elements that make \\"Wallflower\\" a stand out book. The first-person narrative isn't much different from other books in the coming-of-age genre, but Charlie is. In \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and others similar to it, the main characters are jaded and somewhat snobbish, thinking they have the answers. Charlie just wants to be happy and to make others feel good. He's a simple-minded person.<br />Secondly, Stephen Chbosky creates a comprehensive list of things that compliment this novel with music and other books that he gives the titles to freely. Chances are you've heard a good percent of the songs and read one or two of the books. Even \\"M*A*S*H\\" plays a small, significant part in Charlie's world. This helps to understand some of the subtle feelings at times and deepens the novel that much more.<br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is probably the most sincere book to have come out in the past decade or so. Touching to the last, funny and heartwarming, it will adhere to your fingertips like crazy glue until you've turned that final page. And chances are you might just pick it right back up. More likely than that though, is that you'll rush out to share it with someone because it's just that good.
B00006FDCD|1.0|I feel I must &quot;vote&quot; to counterbalance all the positive reviews of this flick. I am truly, completely AMAZED that there are ANY positive reviews of this movie. The movie is as far from scary as it could possibly be. It is not scary, it is not interesting, it is not weird, it is vaguely coherent and it is certainly not entertaining. Terrible acting, lousy script, horribly directed. Plus, since it was created for TV originally, the scenes all fade to black after about 15 minutes. Why in the world they left the credits in the middle is beyond me. I assumed they would have reedited the mini series for video, taking out the fades, the first half credits in the middle of the movie, mabey even adding footage that couldn't be shown on TV or that didn't work originally with the timing issues of a TV broadcast...nope. This movie wouldn't frighten a 10 year old child. The only convincing performance is from John Ritter; the actor who played John Boy absolutely can not act. I can't believe this was deemed acceptable to air on TV, let alone to release on video and DVD. Though I purchased the video for only two dollars, I was robbed. I want my two dollars and three hours of my life back.
B000001FZK|5.0|would listen to this album in heaven.  Talk Talk's Laughing Stock is a completely unclassifiable bit of sonic brilliance.  Biased? Perhaps, but only due to the fact that I've listened to the album.  The songs are tied together by Mark Hollis's wonderfully fragile voice.  Silence plays a major roles in songs such as Runeii, while Ascension Day ends with a loud wall of sound only to collapse into the hushed intro of After the Flood.  Even with noisy shots of distortion injected into songs, there is a content, Zen-like calm feel to the album.  While oftentimes Laughing Stock could be classified as ambient, the music is liquid, twisting and changing constantly.  It is by no means accessible, expect no instant gratification, but a focused listener will find that once you hear this album, your life is changed.  With an album like this, you won't need to buy anything else for months.  This is the sort of album to play at night, staring into the dark, with nothing in mind but the music.  A major touchstone for the 90's post rock bands, anyone that considers themselves fans of experimental music owes it to themselves to listen to this album.
B00005ATQD|5.0|If your taste in movies is action/fantasy/adventure/horror, this film is not for you.  If you appreciate a movie whose complex twists and plot turns and counter-turns puzzle you and make you think, \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is a masterpiece.  Stanley Kubrick was never an easy director to understand and his last movie is a powerful, intriguing enigma.  I'm not a fan of either Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman, but I thought they were both excellent in this film.  Cruise plays a doctor with a comfortable lifestyle (beautiful wife, cute daughter, plush digs on Central Park West), who is devastated by his wife's mock confession of a fantasized infidelity, which sends him out into a night journey in which fantasy and reality become so intertwined that we can't see where one stops and the other starts.  How much do we really see?  Do we sometimes go deliberately blind in order not to see?  Kubrick explores all this and more in this exquisite film, and when the couple wake up to the cold light of day, they are left to realize that fantasy, however distasteful, needn't destroy everything that reality has built up.  A lot of people hate this movie simply because they can't understand it, and it moves at the pace of an arthritic snail; but as previously stated, this is not an action film; you need to slow down and think and reflect as you watch it.  If you have sufficient maturity for this, then this movie is indeed for you.
6304913176|1.0|Its too bad that the director and producer couldn't bring themselves to follow the book, or give this film a differant name. Under a differant name this film may have garnered 4 stars, but as an &quot;adaptation&quot; of Heinlein's book, it is pretty sad. It's too bad, properly done it could be another Star Wars.
B00003CX5P|3.0|The Phantom Menace DVD is excellent in terms of quality, extras, and fun.  However, as a die-hard Star Wars fan this by far is my least favorite.  It is not what we Star Wars fans are used to seeing or expect from George Lucas.  Jar Jar & Boss Nass are incredibly annoying and make Barney look like a cool dude.  There are so much CG characters and ships, that some of the scenes will make you dizzy.  Jake Lloyds performace is mediochre at best.  The Dialogue scenes go on forever and the mystical Force has been reduced to a genetic infection of micro-organisms called \\"Midichlorians\\".  The greater the infection, the more potential one has as a Jedi.  Even without all the extremely high expectations, this movie is a major miss in terms of what we should expect from ANY Star Wars movie.  On a positive note, Liam Neesons performance as Qui Gonn Jinn & the Lightsaber duel between Obi Wan & Darth Maul are superb.  The Pod-race is like watching a sci-fi version of the Indy 500 and is quite entertaining.  In my opinion, those are the only redeeming qualities that this movie has.  If you aren't a die-hard Star Wars fan, but want to see this anyway, rent it first.  If you are a Star Wars fan, you gotta have this DVD anyway because it is sadly the foundation for the prequels and the saga itself.  I recommend reading James Luceno's \\"Cloak of Deception\\" FIRST.  The book allows one to make a lot more sense our of the movie and you will have an understanding of the events that set this first chapter of the STAR WARS saga into motion.
0783219598|4.0|The pigs aren't the most popular animals in the world for good reasons, but this particular little pig, named Babe, will win your sympathy even if you hate animal films in general, because Babe can perform several tasks that only a dog can do and Babe also has a heart of gold, and even the most straight-faced creatures in the movie begin to develop sympathy for the pig.      \\"Babe\\" has a lot of colorful, wild and funny animals that join the little Babe in this charming adventure, you will see a duck that thinks that is a rooster, brave dogs, a little mice chorus and a gentle sheep, among many others. The music in \\"Babe\\" is nice, funny and charming. The special effects are simple but very effective, the animals really look like they were talking.

B00003CXA3|5.0|It's getting a tad frayed around the edges, but \\"The French Connection\\" has stood up remarkably well over thirty years, thanks largely to a great cast, a great director (William Friedkin) and a crackerjack plot - not to mention the mother of all car chases.  Only Gene Hackman could have played Popeye Doyle, a straight-up jerk whose bull-in-the-china-closet operating method rolls over everything in his way, including his own colleagues.  Playing his partner admirably well is Roy Scheider as Buddy Russo, whose patience at Doyle's antics sometimes wears as thin as the soles on his shoes.  The two of them are narcs, and they are out to intercept the arrival and distribution of a monster shipment of heroin from Marseilles by a drug kingpin named Alan Charnier.  The movie zips along as Doyle and Charnier attempt to outwit each other; one of the best sequences in the film is Doyle following Charnier along the streets of midtown Manhattan into the subway (native New Yorkers have fun identifying the path they take) and losing him on the train.  Doyle in his own way is as repulsive as the drug dealers he's up against; he's a racist, selfish, insensitive, uncaring about anybody but himself.  But his single-minded mania serves him well in this chase; he'll bring down his prey one way or another.  The classic scene in this movie is, of course, the car chase under the elevated subway that practically defined the term \\"car chase\\"; it's mind-boggling to try to imagine how Friedkin managed to shoot this sequence.  The supporting actors in the movie are excellent; I especially liked Tony LoBianco as the middleman Sal Boca, Arlene Farber as his wife Angie, Benny Marino as his brother Lou (does the family that deals together stay together?), Patrick McDermott as the cool-as-ice chemist testing the purity of Charnier's stock and stamping it with his seal of approval; and above all, the sinister performance given by Marcel Bozzuffi as Pierre Nicoli, Charnier's hitman, who will shoot anyone in cold blood without batting an eyelash.  The cinematography has a kind of grainy quality that enhances the gritty story being played out.  Even though it seems a bit dated, \\"The French Connection\\" still stands out as one of the high points of American film.ne in cold blood without batting an eyelash.

However, Tracy's general method of how to train babies I find completely counter-intuitive.  The book will advise parents to always have your newborn sleep in the same place (their own crib) and to always nurse in the same place.  She proposes that this schedule will make life easier on the parents because you can then plan but who wants to plan your whole day around your babies nap and feeding times making sure to be home for all them - you would never be able to leave the house!  Babies are actually quite portable and if you are nursing then they will feed quite happily wherever mommy is.<br />However, being inexperienced as I was this book did shine the light on some major mistakes I was making about reading my baby's cues especially when it came time to interpreting when she was tired and needed to sleep.  She also reveals other golden tidbits of information I had not read or heard anywhere else...For instance, while all the experts talk about how long breast milk will keep in the freezer she points out that a mother's milk is constantly changing to meet the changing needs of her baby. So, although the milk is not spoiled it will not be exactly what the breast is currently manufacturing nor what the baby needs.<br />I do recommend the book but advise not to follow her plan to stringently.  Take what is helpful and leave the rest.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I am a true Jane Austen lover.  Persuasion is one of her best novels, yet this movie failed to live up to the emotion and feeling of the book.  Amanda Root's portrayal of Anne is insipid and she does little more move around the movie looking pained.  There is no chemistry at all between Anne and Captain Wentworth, and I felt that the pieces where the movie deviated from the story were not only not needed, but poorly done.  Really quite disappointing.
B00004TDRD|5.0|28 years ago this summer, an almost-unknown director named Steven Spielberg, at the ripe old age of 25, released a film that caused a stampede at the box office and single-handedly started the phenomenon of the summer blockbuster with \\"legs\\", the movie you had to see again and again and again.  Even after all this time, the ominous opening music from \\"Jaws\\" still sends a delicious tingle down the spine.  Spielberg's genius lay in turning Peter Benchley's mediocre novel into a well-acted, well-directed, terrifying classic horror movie.  He omitted all the boring side dramas that cluttered up the book and stuck to the bare bones; i.e., the primeval battle between man and a monster fish packing two hundred teeth and an attitude.<br />\\"Jaws\\" has more than a little in common with \\"Moby Dick\\", especially in Quint's fatal error in making his battle with the shark a personal vendetta, as Ahab did in his hunt for the white whale.  Just as the whale does in \\"Moby Dick\\", the shark turns the tables on its hunters and begins hunting them.  We see all of Quint's hubris brought low from the time he swaggers onto the deck of his own boat, monarch of all he surveys, until he ends up being relentlessly chewed up and swallowed by his nemesis.  Spielberg brings all this to us in vivid detail and reminds us that, after all, sharks will be sharks.<br />Spielberg has a gift for humorous touches as well, and he's a master at contrast.  I still crack up over the scene where the two boys scared the bejesus out of several hundred people in fake shark outfits; the laughter turns to horrified gasps immediately in the next scene, in which a hysterical girl points out the real shark only a few hundred feet upstream, ready to chow down on an unsuspecting guy in a rowboat.  The scene with the boneheaded mayor goggle-eyed in outrage at a defaced beach poster, blind to the reality of the threat out in the water, is a howler.  And the scene in which Quint smashes the boat's radio with a stick, effectively cutting off their communication with the outside world, is a masterpiece; the dawning terror in Quint's eyes, when he realizes that it's just them alone with the shark, and he finally realizes what an unequal contest it is, underlines all the folly of setting himself up against a power so much stronger than he is, that he can't hope to understand it, let alone defeat it.<br />So how has this film stood up over the past quarter-century?  Leave the mechanics of the shark's workings out of it; sure, they can do it better now with better technology.  The film still delivers on its premise; it's still one helluva horror movie.vely cutting off their communication with the outside world, is a masterpiece; the dawning terror in Quint's eyes, when he realizes that it's just them alone with the shark, and he finally realizes what an unequal contest it is, underlines all the folly of setting himself up against a power so much stronger than he is, that he can't hope to understand it, let alone defeat it.<br />So how has this film stood up over the past quarter-century?

B00006L7XQ|4.0|\\"The Man Comes Around\\" would be a pretty remarkably album even if Johnny Cash weren't as terribly ill as he's reported to be. That a man over 70 can still generate this much intensity is nothing short of astounding. There are a lot of successful mediocre rock bands out there who ought to take note. Cash's albums for American records have been uniformly fine, but this may be the best one yet.<br />What really stands out is the song selection. Cash's version of Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\" takes the cold techno-rock anthem out of the freezer and warms it up to the point where it sounds as if the apocalypse is upon us. Other well known songs  getting the benefits of Cash's God-like voice are the Simon and Garfunkle standard \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" the Eagles's \\"Desperado\\" (which takes on a whole new meaning) and the formerly syrupy ballad \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.\\" Other highlights include the title track, \\"Give My Love to Rose\\" and the mournful \\"I Hung My Head.\\" A few songs don't work quite as well and there are occasions when Cash's voice seems to waver from fatigue, but that is mere quibbling.<br />Overall, another triumph from one of America's greatest-ever musicians.
B00006V9A0|5.0|NIRVANA. That's all I can say about this album. <br />     The dictionary states that Nirvana is the final freeing of a soul from all that enslaves it; especially: the supreme hapiness. That is not exactly what NIRVANA brings, but is pretty close.<br />     It is definitely the greastest piece of art I have ever heard. It brings the true spirit of NIRVANA. People think NIRVANA is all about hard rock, but they would be wrong. <br />     Yes I enjoy the hard guitar, bass and drums but this isn't what NIRVANA is about. It's about the lyrics.<br />     The lyrics is what made NIRVANA big and that is what kept them big.<br />     &quot;Pain!&quot;<br />     &quot;But I can't see you every night&quot;<br />     &quot;She should of worn the crown of thorns&quot;<br />     &quot;Grandma take me home&quot;<br />     &quot;Here we are now, entertain us&quot;<br />     &quot;Come as you are&quot;<br />     &quot;I'm so happy cuz today I found my friends, there in my head&quot; (only one of the many great lines of Lithium)<BR>     <BR>     &quot;Sell the kids for food&quot;<br />     &quot;Yeah! Wait! I got a new complaint&quot;<br />     &quot;I am a liar and a thief&quot;<br />     &quot;I'm not the only one&quot;<br />     &quot;I think I'm dumb, maybe just happy&quot;<br />     &quot;What else should I say&quot;<br />     These are the greatest lines I have ever heard. Yeah, NIRVANA is known for the sound of Kurt's guitar, Krist's bass and Dave's drums but the lyrics are just better than those things. You have got to buy this album, even if you haven't heard of NIRVANA.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|These girls are awesome! First off, they're an openly lesbian group. That's brave. Plus, their music is outstanding! I mainly listen to metal (MuDvAyNe, Disturbed, Killswitch Engage, In Flames, Bile, Murderdolls, Metallica, and others) and even I love this group. This is definitely a must have for anyone into music on any scale.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|This was one of my first DVD purchases and it is probably the one that I cherish the most. The picture and sound quality is nothing short of astounding. And the performance is equally spectacular.<BR>It would be a \\"Tragedy\\" for any Bee Gee fan not to own this dvd. And although we may not get \\"Too Much Heaven\\" anymore, listening to these guys harmonize is as close as it gets.<br />One last thought. The uncertainty of the future of the Bee Gees following the recent death of Maurice makes this concert all that much more special to me.
B00006LIRI|4.0|U2's 1990s \\"Best Of\\" album is a rather strange collection.  The band recorded only four studio albums during that time, all of which ardent U2 fans most likely already own.  So this disc is for casual fans who want only the highlights, right?  Well, not exactly.  1991's \\"Ach-tung Baby\\" gets the most conventional treatment--the four selections from it (\\"Even Better than the Real Thing,\\" \\"Mysterious Ways,\\" \\"One\\" and \\"Until the End of the World\\") are all the original versions.  Likewise, the band's most recent studio album, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" is grossly underepresnted with only two selections (\\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\") that are also original versions.<br />It is the rest of the material where things really get strange.  The three songs from the album \\"Pop\\" are all remixes, probably in acknowledgement that it was U2's least successful album.  Likewise, the \\"Zooropa\\" cut \\"Numb\\" gets a similar realtering, but one that serves it very well.  Otherwise that album is also underrepresented.  Of the non-studio album tracks, \\"The Hands That Built America\\" from the \\"Gangs of New York\\" soundtrack is a ho-hum ballad (like the movie), while the two other new songs included add little to the band's legacy.  The CD booklet, however, is quite cool--lots of photographs of the band looking pretty slick for a bunch of forty-somethings.<br />Overall, \\"The Best of...1990-2000\\" contains a lot of outstanding music, but is nevertheless a terribly confused anthology.
B00005JLSC|5.0|starring Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart; Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma Kelly; Richard Gere as Billy Flynn; Queen Latifah as Matron Mama Morton; Dominic West as Fred Casely; John C. Reilly as Amos Hart<br />Based on the story of two real celebrity murderesses who lived in the 1920s, Chicago has been parlayed into a 1926 Broadway play, a 1927 silent movie, a 1942 film starring Ginger Rogers, and a modern Broadway show, which debuted in 1975 and was revived in 1996. The Twenties are roaring in the Windy City, and Roxie Hart wants a piece of the action. Lights, live music, skimpy costumes and lots of background dancers: she has her sights set on her own vaudeville act. She'd give anything to be like beautiful Jazz songstress Velma Kelly and see her name on the local marquee. And she knows that her marriage to dopey, sweet, un-enthralling Amos won't be her ticket to fame and fortune. So she starts \\"fooling around\\" with other men. Fooling around leads to \\"screwing around\\" (defined as \\"fooling around without dinner\\") with Fred Casely, who says he's got connections down at the Jazz club. Then she discovers that the only kind of connections on Fred's mind happen between bed sheets, and she knocks him off with her husband's pistol. Ironically, she finds herself on \\"murderer's row\\" at the women's prison right next to the great Ms. Kelly, who has recently dispatched her own husband and sister after catching them in an affair. <br />With the help of Matron Mama Morton, both Roxie and Velma get hooked up with smooth-talking lawyer Billy Flynn, who boasts that he's never lost a case defending a female criminal. For $5,000 (and a little action on the side) Flynn vows to create such a public outpouring of sympathy and support for his clients that no jury could possibly convict them. And so he does. Smartly mingled into the story line are bombastic showstoppers and heartrending solo numbers that both develop the characters and give a glimpse of the vaudeville fame to which Roxie aspires. Everyone gets into the song and dance, and it's easy to see why the stage show that inspired this film has recently received revived acclaim on Broadway and overseas.<br />the Best Picture of 2002
B000065U1N|5.0|Stars Josh Hartnet as the lead, if you want to call him the lead.  There are so many characters that are developed throughout the movie that you forget that there is a main character.  Each soldier almost has there own story line.  From the Delta's to the Rangers, Captains, Liuetinenants and so forth.  Starts off with developing of the war in Somilia and taking it through how we (US) get involved in trying to capature the warlord Mohammad Adid and his commanders when a blackhawk gets show down.  This is when all hell breaks loose as you could say, one thing goes wrong after another, and its amazing how these different groups of soldiers still manage to keep it under some sort of control.  Just an amazing movie with lots of character development and with drama but with mostly action.  Definitly a great movie along with Three Kings, another great war story.

B000002HB4|4.0|Before there were The Black Crowes, there were The Georgia Satelites, hailing from the same area and with a sound that their latter counterparts would sell millions of albums with.  The Satelites' problem was that other than the delightful single &quot;Keep Your Hands to Yourself,&quot; they just weren't able to come up with any big hits.  The song was a delight, bursting through on rock radio that was at the time just shaking off its new wave hangover.  &quot;Battleship Chains&quot; was a near miss follow up from the debut album, but after that the band never again was much of a chart success.<br />With 20 selections, &quot;Let it Rock&quot; is a generous anthology.  There are a healthy collection of covers, including Rongo Star's &quot;Don't Pass Me By,&quot; John Fogerty's &quot;Almost Saturday Night/Rockin' All Over the World&quot; and Chuck Berry's &quot;Let it Rock.&quot;  The rest of the material is mostly solid, even if individual tunes sometimes have difficulty standing out.  The CD booklet doesn't have a lyrics sheet, but does contain extensive liner notes.<br />Overall, a decent anthology album from an often-overlooked southern rock band.
B000002HJA|5.0|Kyuss' fourth and final album, \\"And the Circus Leaves Town\\" still packs quite a punch, but it is obvious that some of the group's inspiration has faded.  This is not due to Circus's rather sudden style change however, but is more accurately accredited to the insanely inflated expectations fans had come to hold after the releases of the equally genius \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\" and \\"Welcome to Sky Valley.\\"  Dealing with the departure of Brant Bjork and continuing disputes between members, Kyuss was in no shape to meet such a ridiculous challenge and the resulting album sounds somewhat incomplete when measured up to such difficult standards.  Despite a little initial disappointment however, Circus is still an immensely enjoyable listen, and after getting past the shock of its rather odd left of center sound, it eventually reveals itself to be nearly as good if not comparable to the band's more noteworthy releases.  <BR>Admirably so, Kyuss never attempts to copy the glory of their past triumphs, but the incredible song variety of Sky Valley and concise song structures of Blues for the Red Sun do carry over quite smoothly.  When it comes to the musical content of these familiar layouts however, Kyuss have completely changed their motives.  Instead of channeling the fury of the scorching sun and the parched earth, the band proceeds with an overall quieter, more introspective approach that takes in the somber solitude of the desert and calmly breathes it back out.  There are still occasional spikes of reverb, sandstorms of passion tearing across the serene barren landscape, but the gentle wah-wah grooves of Homme's guitar and the soft crooning of John Garcia's voice play a much more integral role in defining the atmosphere of the album than the volume of the amps do.  Although it achieves its goals in a rather roundabout manner, And the Circus Leaves Town does end up reaching a climactic pinnacle, finally tying together the album's conflicting optimistic ballads of perseverance and crushing fuzz-laden conveyers of pessimism with the constant genre shifts of \\"Spaceship Landing.\\"  The new stylistic shifts in And the Circus Leaves Town, like Soundgarden's \\"Down on the Upside,\\" certainly hint at the disillusionment and ensuing breakup of the band, but before our ears had the pleasure of being graced by the unique sounds of Unida and Queens of the Stone Age, Circus left us with a wonderful end to the Kyuss legacy.
B00006IUL7|4.0|I originally saw this film in the theatre during one of the opening weekends.  Surprisingly, I realized the plot of the movie, having the feeling that I'd seen this film before (but that's impossible!)  I in fact had seen the 1997 Norwegian film which &quot;Insomnia&quot; was based upon, years before.  From what I can recall, the American version followed the Norwegian version's script pretty closely.  I was a bit dissapointed, however, that I knew how it would end from seeing the Norwegian version first.  I would definitely recommend this DVD if you like suspense thrillers.
B000002LR6|4.0|You gotta hand it to Al Jourgenson, Ministry's chief lunatic and long time leader.  If Neil Young is the \\"Godfather of Grunge,\\" then Al has the same parental relationship with hardcore industrial thrash.  He opened the door that others such as Trent Reznor and, ulp, Marilyn Manson, would burst through so confidently.  His music almost defies criticism.  You'll know from the first grinding note if this is your cup of tea.  If not, nothing I can tell you about it is going to make one bit of difference.<br />That said, \\"Psalm 69\\" is perhaps the best of Ministry's original albums.  Certainly, it contains the band's most tuneful single (\\"Jesus Built My Hotrod\\") since their brief mid-80s stint as Frankie Goes to Hollywood [copies].  Only this band could bring in a guy like Butthole Surfers' lead singer Gibby Haines to make them more \\"commercial.\\"  My complaint is that the CD-single of the song actually contains a longer (and better) version of \\"JBMH\\" than the album.  Another highlight is \\"N.W.O.,\\" which features King George Bush I proclaiming a New World Order in an endless tape loop as the music roars behind him.  This is ugly music with a certain grace to it.<br />Overall, a strong album from the kind of artist that people either love of they hate.  Long may he rave.
B000002HEP|5.0|Sky Valley, simply put, is the soundtrack of the Armageddon.  Only when the final nukes are dropping and the infamous four horsemen are riding over the horizon line will the incapacitating power of this album ever be paralleled.  On \\"Welcome to Sky Valley,\\" Kyuss, California's premier stoner rock 4 piece, delivers yet another display of breathtaking might.  While certainly not a better album than its painfully loud predecessor, the legendary \\"Blues for the Red Sun,\\" Sky Valley does bear the obvious mark of evolution.  Dividing itself into three distinct chapters, each grouping of songs has a radically different atmospheric aura than its surroundings, individually featuring everything from the fiercest of guitar, percussion, and vocal bouts to the gentlest of acoustic passages.  When these three opposing chapters are all put together on a single disc however, they seamlessly proceed like a single extended jam session, containing the perfect balance of conflict and compliment to reach a metaphoric plateau of ideal musical harmony.  Gradually shifting from the ultra sludgy riffing of Gardenia, to the quiet trance of Space Cadet, and finally ending with the psychedelic cacophony of Whitewater, every track on Sky Valley adds a new piece to the puzzle to construct something that doesn't simply feel like a CD, but fits together as a truly mammoth album.  Trough deafening choruses and mellow interludes, Sky Valley manages to attain a distinctly tight unity that few albums can speak of while still maintaining an environment of variety once again certifying Kyuss' place as one of the heaviest and most intelligent bands in stoner rock's burgeoning history.

B0000025P9|2.0|&quot;Toto IV&quot; can be summed up pretty simply.  The album kicks off with the massive hit &quot;Rosanna,&quot; and concludes with another massive hit, &quot;Africa.&quot;  In between it contains scarcely a song worth hearing.  The strong pop hooks that make the two hits so appealing are utterly absent.  The rest is merely midtempo filler material that no one other than an ardent fan will likely ever want to hear more than once.  This stuff is the very difinition of soulless professionalism.<br />Still, there are those two big hits, and given that Toto's only other successful single was &quot;Hold the Line&quot; from their first album, buying &quot;Toto IV&quot; makes almost as much sense as buying the band's greatest hits album.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|The rhythm, the passion, the fury, the swagger, the poise, the style, the ugly finesse, the backbeat, the sound: it's such a beautiful mess that it represents all of punk music's highest aspirations almost perfectly.  <BR>The Clash were in a world of their own when they made this record, and it was a world of sincere creative passion.  When it doesn't make you want to dance it makes you want to shout.  It makes you want to stand up and take charge of your life and catch the biggest wave you can find.  The Clash invited every style, idea, beat, and culture into their music, mingled with it, and danced with it until it hit home.  <BR>The guitar is textured to fit every style, from the boom boom reggae groove to the straight up punch of punk rock.  The lyrics are born of an urban and worldwide consciousness, no strings attached, nothing but pure expression.  Where countless other artists have failed to mix genres, the Clash succeeded.  THere is nothing wrong with this album, even if it's too long.  Just put it in and let yourself go.  Revolution Rock.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel, by Garth Nix is an amazing fantasy book with plenty of detail and action. The book is about a young girl named Sabriel who sets out into a world of dead and undead creatures hoping to find her father. It is a book where death and life are one in the same, where the dead come out at night and feast on people and steal thier goods. A world that shuns magic, but it is the only thing to protect them from the dead. A world of modern technology, which is useless, using swords and spells to defeat the some of the most feared creatures in existence. Sabriel, a young school girl, must travel into this world of the dead unknown and try and save her dying father. This is a compelling and very well written book with suspense, action, and a little romance, a pageturner for sure.

B00005JL3A|3.0|This movie is EXTREMELY UNDERRATED. No, it's not a classic. No, it's not an academy award winner. But it does succeed where many others have failed.<br />First, the good things:<br />1) THE PACING, ACTION, AND SUSPSENSE are some of the best I've ever seen in a film. This film has a real sense of urgency and moves along at a breathtaking pace. It jumps from gloomy suspense to exciting action all within minutes. Both aspects are done very well; the movie will excite you with its visceral action scenes and scare you at the same time.<BR>2) THE ACTING is well done. While much of the characters aren't explained through dialogue, their body movements and subtle gestures to each other make you learn much about the characters. Some of the acting is a bit sketchy, but it's good enough that it comes to the point where you care when some of the people die.<BR>3) THE MUSIC AND PRODUCTION DESIGN: The sets are wonderful and completely convey the high-tech, computerized feel that the movie is about. The music also flows with the production design and the acting, so everything feels in-sync. And by the way, the music greatly helps the picture, whether its the booming base during the battle scenes are the subtle high notes during the suspensful ones.<BR>4) THE PLOT IS GREAT. The director has the characters face so many enemies (alive, undead, machine, chemical, etc.) that the movie keeps surprising you and makes you keep guessing. It unfolds as a mystery and with the characters trying to pick up the pieces throughout.<br />And the bad things...<br />1) THE LENGTH was too short. At only 94 minutes (not including the credits), it didn't leave a lasting impression and I was forced to watch it again to get a better \\"feel\\" for it. There could've been much more character development and some of the sets created great places for some outstanding action scenes. Unfortunately, they are not to be seen.<BR>2) THE SPECIAL EFFECTS could've been better. Seeing the Licker push its way out of the metal cage always looks fake to me. But, they had a low budget so the Director did the best he could.<BR>3) THE ENDING, although good, should've been replaced with the alternate one. According to web interviews with director Paul W.S. Anderson and the commentary, there was a huge, action-packed ending with Milla Jovovich using the same gun that the \\"One\\" character had. A chance for more much-needed action. The ending presently in the movie is good and leaves room for a sequel, but I think there was enough scary stuff in the movie and it needed more action. Also, the \\"climatic\\" battle with the Licker on the train was sort of a disappoinment.<br />All in all, a solid video-game to movie adaption. It still has many problems, but you can do MUCH worse that sit through and enjoy this. Trust me.                             3.5 stars.<br />2002; 101 minutes; RATED R for strong violence/gore, some bad language, and brief sexuality/nudity.
0767827791|5.0|This movie is certainly one of the best of it's time. Still great viewing today. But what makes this film one of the best ever put on film is the scene where Kim Novak comes down the stairs to the song \\"Moonglow\\" to dance with Bill Holden...What a great scene. No nudity. No bad language. In fact no talking at all. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys a truly great and sensuous movie.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This CD contains almost all the songs any one who is not a diehard Fleetwood Mac fan would need or want. It has a larger selection than their other greatest hits CD, the one with the green cover from 1988 entitled simply, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. One thing I hate, though, is that three of the songs are &quot;live&quot; versions: I'm So Afraid, Big Love, and Go Insane. I wish they had given us the studio versions and stuck those live versions on a live CD instead, where they belong. Oh well, nothing's ever perfect. On the plus side, the sound quality is far better than any Fleetwood Mac CD ever sounded in the past. If you compare the sound of any given song on this set to the original release album it is from, you will be pleasantly surprised. It now sounds much more natural, much more alive than it ever did before. They really did a great job remastering this set. If you do not own any Fleetwood Mac CDs, start here. I suspect for most people Rhiannon, Silver Springs, Over My Head, Sara, Landslide (this is the studio version, even better than the live version that has become popular recently), Songbird, The Chain, Gypsy, Little Lies, Gold Dust Woman, Hold Me, Seven Wonders and As Long As You Follow will be all the Fleetwood Mac you ever really need.
0060977493|1.0|This book is extremely complicated with an underdeveloped plot.  The readers spends the first half of the book wondering who Sophie Mol is and eagerly awaiting the beginning of the plot.  The second half is filled with the disappointment of realizing that the plot was not worth trudging through the heavy words and mixed up concepts.  The sexual exploitation appears to serve no purpose in the novel except to offer a bit of shock value.  It appears to be strategically placed in the middle in order to keep the reader from giving up.  My advice is to look for another book.

B00000064E|5.0|If only Nick Drake had not died in 1974  (We could only  Imagine, folks.) This album is truly amazing. I'm glad I have this album (finally) on CD. \\"Time Has Told Me\\" (With ex-Fairport Conv. guitarist Richard Thompson) redefines folk-rock and \\"River Man\\" and \\"Day Is Done\\" makes any road trip a wonderful experience. \\"Saturday Sun\\" keeps me from hibernating when on that road trip, so retrospective yet forward-thinking. A true visionary - someone who keeps defining folk-rock three decades later, just listen to our current list of singer-songwriters (Richard Shindell, Dar Williams, Patty Larkin, Duncan Shiek, etc) You'll hear a little bit of Nick Drake in their songs. Peace - JG
B000002UZ4|5.0|WHat more can I say than what the rest of the reveiwers said. My favortie songs are &quot;What Have I done To Deserve This?&quot; with the late Dusty Springfield and &quot;West End Girls&quot;. This is an excellent collection to buy.
B00005JLXC|2.0|I finally saw DAREDEVIL and it is a mixed bag at best. The movie \\"looked fine\\", presenting us with a welcome dark tone and serious nature which we have come to expect in today's super-hero themed movies. It was bogged down with a few Matrix style fight scenes, but not as many as the trailer implied, thank goodness! Ben Affleck gave a fine performance, as did Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin. He didn't have much character development, but he did really great with what was there. Edit the horrible love story and the movie would be MUCH better. Get rid of the [bad] songs and the love story would at least be bearable! The whole \\"glimmering angelic beauty\\" of Elektra in the rainstorm was absurd, give me a break! I wasn't the only one rolling my eyes over this sequence, but more on that later. This movie is nothing more than a borderline chick-flick as it stands! I do wish that the main characters wouldn't have started exhibiting super human abilities for absolutely no reason. During the climax of the film, Daredevil literally \\"became\\" Spiderman, climbing effortlessly all over the surfaces of the church! I thought he was just a human with heightened senses! For that matter, Elektra and Bullseye were also rather ridiculous in a movie that strives to be so **believeable**, what with their abilities to do super-human stunts and high flying leaps. Utterly ridiculous to be sure! One question, why in the world does Matt Murdock sleep in a sarcophagus????????????????? Why was this never explained???????????????????<br />Colin Farrell actually gave an entertaining performance as the villainous Bullseye, though not neccessarily accurate to the comics. Whether or not that is good or bad point is a matter of personal taste, but he served the purpose in the film. It would have been nice to see the film stick a bit closer to the comics as far as character design though. Daredevil looked OK, but I think his outfit could have been better. Nice mask though! Bullseye had a horrible costume that in no way reflected his comic book counterpart. Kingpin didn't really look the part either, other than his diamond headed staff. Even Elektra was changed, though very beautiful none the less! A little more design work would have yielded better results without resorting to people running around in tights! <br />I understand that about twenty minutes of character driven story elements were cut from the film to quicken its pace and shorten its length. This move may have ultimately hurt the film, seeing that it is rather lacking in character development overall. If anything should have been left on the cutting room floor, it would have to be the \\"dance routine\\"......er....I mean stand off between Elektra and Matt in the park. I HATE to call this woefully choreographed dance number a fight! That was the single dumbest thing I have seen put to film in years! Did the director think this part of the film needed some sort of silly action sequence....... \\"Hmm, the movie is dragging in this stretch.....where can I put an action scene to liven it up........ AHA..... a dance number in the park...PERFECT!\\" I cringe thinking about this low point in the film, yet it makes me want to laugh that the filmakers actually thought it would work or be taken seriously!<br />Now, back to Matt's raindrop vision of Elektra! I like the way in which we (the audience) are brought into the blind world of Matt Murdock. He operates via 'heightened senses' and 'sonar', which is a fine idea lifted directly from the comic books. This would enable him to use sound to detect where objects and structures are located and at what distances they are from him. The visual effect that basically flashes waves of light (to represent the sound waves) is intended for the audience and is not actually what Matt \\"sees\\". Keeping this in mind, his being able to \\"see\\" Elektra in the rain is a very contrived and ridiculous sequence in the film. All the rain should do for Matt is enable him to know where she isstanding and nothing more. Did the radioactive chemicals give Matt the power to utilize what is only there for the audiences' benefit in addition to his other heightened senses? Just another example of the lack of logic used when making decisions on this film.<br />With lots of fine tuning, this could have been an excellent entry in the world of live action comic book films, but as it stands it is a lackluster effort that has the words \\"LOOK WHAT I COULD HAVE BEEN\\" plastered all over it. That is a real shame, but hopefully the inevitable sequel will right the wrongs presented to us here. Go ahead and see the film and judge for yourself!<br />It has been officially confirmed by Twentieth Century Fox that a solo film based on the character of Elektra is in the works. I ask the question \\"why\\"? What is there about her that sets her apart from any other generic female action star flick? DAREDEVIL is a success because he is a generally well known super hero, not on scale with Spiderman or Hulk, but still generally well known. Judging from what is given to the general audience like myself in the DAREDEVIL film, there isn't very much there to inspire anyone to want more of her character other than in a DAREDEVIL sequel. I want to see her reunited with Matt, even though the film's love story failed to \\"hook\\" me like it should have, but if not with him then I am not interested at all. I am willing to bet a large part of the paying public shares these feelings. I am not bashing Jennifer Garner's performance or anything, I just don't see the appeal of her going solo and doubt that an ELEKTRA film will share in the success of DAREDEVIL.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Unlike most people who love this movie, I do not. I like it but dont love it.  I thought the special effects were hammy and the acting a little bit stiff.  I thought the color sequences were beautiful, the way the red and blue flowed thorugh the movie.  The green goblin part was to me very stupid and his laugh was unbearable.  Anyways I recommend it but very lightly.
B00005MK9Y|4.0|Clearly, the first album that introduces crowds into the living memory and soul of Robert Nesta Marley has to be &quot;Legend&quot;.  Babylon By Bus takes these future fans one step further.  This album is packed with strong emotions, impacting lyrics and has been recorded before an all mighty crowd.  Songs such as Rastaman Vibration, Rat Race, etc., build a long lasting impression for one of the best thought out albums ever.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This is the very best that power-metal can offer. Though half the tracks are spoken-word story-based, the other half is just increadible music (and there's no shortage since the CD has 22 tracks). This is one of the best concept albums ever, that follows the story of Tolkien's Silmarillion, which these guys made one hell of a job to adapt.<br />1. War of Wrath <BR>2. Into the Storm 9/10 (One of the best tracks, very hard-hitting and powerful)  <BR>3. Lammoth    <BR>4. Nightfall 11/10 (Best song on the CD, the choruses are excellent) <BR>5. Minstrel  <BR>6. Curse of Feanor 9/10 (Powerful and Energetic song)<BR>7. Captured        <BR>8. Blood Tears 8/10 (Starts out soft but escalates to a power-march that flows into...)       <BR>9. Mirror Mirror 9/10 (Similar to Blood tears, with &quot;happy&quot; choruses)       <BR>10. Face the Truth        <BR>11. Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns) 8/10       <BR>12. Battle of Sudden Flame        <BR>13. Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill) 10/10 (Another kick-arse song, one of the best)      <BR>14. Dark Elf        <BR>15. Thorn 8/10       <BR>16. Eldar 7.5/10 (Very sad, quiet piano ballad)     <BR>17. Nom the Wise        <BR>18. When Sorrow Sang 8.5/10        <BR>19. Out on the Water        <BR>20. Steadfast        <BR>21. Dark Passage 8.5 (Basic endtrack, but does NOT leave much to be desired)       <BR>22. Final Chapter (Thus Ends...)  <br />As you can see, it's not few &quot;punch&quot; tracks that make the CD, but the CD as a whole, with it's increadible concistence.
B00005JKGK|4.0|I read the story when I was a student and found it excellent and i recommended it to my friend at university (he became my husband after one year).  One of the best parts was about An Mei and her mother.  Her mother's life was so miserable and in the she committed suicide so that An Mei could have a better life in the rich man's household.  I congratulated her tactics because she got what she wanted in the end based upon the old Chinese supertition-a vengeful ghost will seek revenge until she gets what she was owed in her previous life.  One of my biggest disappointments was the film was too short although it was two hours.  Still, a tv drama series would have been better so that first-timers are able to follow the storyline.<br />Another part of the story should be focussed more was the girl with a child husband.  In the film, it didn't show the part where the servant girl forgets to watch the candles which I found it a must to be added into the film.  <br />Overall, I still love the story very much and I recommend the viewers should read the novel.  Amy Tan is certainly a good Chinese novelist and I have read most of her books (The Kitchen God's wife, The Bone Collector's Daughter and The Hundred Secret Senses).  I am waiting for her new book to be published.  I hope she does not give up writing because I am just addicted to her sense of humour delivered in a Chinese way.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I am entranced with Norah Jones's album. At barely half my age, I'm amazed by the maturity of her musicianship, especially her timing and phrasing. I can't help but think of Rickie Lee Jones's and Laura Nyro's early efforts. Finally we have a keeper.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I was watching an episode of Smallville when this wonderful melody floated through my head making me smile. No Such Thing is as pure and inviting as a pop song can be. Despite the similarities to other artists like Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer has something all the other present-day artists lack - delicate, shimmering soulfulness.<br />John Mayer creates all of his great, yet sweet songs by combining excellent lyrics and delicious melodies with his own raw, yet tender tone of voice. His songs for example Not Myself and Your Body Is A Wonderland give me the tingles. <br />If you are looking for something fresh, something that simply just doesn't imitate the sounds of commercial pop and rock artists, something that's unique in it's own tasty way, choose John Mayer. Enjoy his delightful tunes, close your eyes and simply smile. I do.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I usually don't buy movie soundtracks but I loved the movie Chicago so much that I wanted the CD but I was really disappointed that the producers felt compelled to include two selections that were not in the film, a hip-hop rendition (their words, not mine) of &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; performed by Queen Latifah as well as &quot;Love is a Crime&quot; performed by Anastacia.  These 2 bonus tracks, though they might have been inspired by the motion picture, were definitely of a different genre than the rest of the CD and were both unnecessary and irritating.
B000005JA8|3.0|I can definately appreciate Captain Beefheart and especially when you consider the time period it was written.  I love the fact that he basicly did a free-jazz version of the blues with odd time signatures and rhythmic dissonances.  <BR>My favorite songs on this are MOONLIGHT ON VERMONT, WHEN BIG JOAN SETS UP, SUGAR N' SPIKES, ANT MAN BEE and the 2 HAIR PIE BAKE tracks.  <BR>My problem with this lies mostly in the filler, more specificly the &quot;avant-garde&quot; poetry on the real lo-fi stuff like well most of the rest of the songs.  These are really silly stoned out hippy throwawy that probably sounded good at the time but months later lost its significance.  Nothing wrong with recording it and even putting it out, but why have critics and fans lionized this as a great album? Its not that great.<BR>In my opinion SAFE AS MILK is definately the best Beefheart album.  And I don't care what anyone says it is just as experimental as this abeit much more listenable.  ELECTRICITY being the best example of this.<BR>Maybe people just say this is so good because TROUT MASK was the zeinith of an eclectic career in terms of evolving his own unique style.  I mean after this it all got much more formulaic and blander even at least much more smoothed out, loosing the rough unpolished tones of old.
0312305060|1.0|I try, I really do. I read the hyped books and the ones that win awards. I NEVER like them. I wonder why? Probably because they are boring books and never really go anywhere. Or the subject is<br />so esoteric and contrived that it seems the purpose of writing is<br />for the author to snare some award.<br /><br />What was the purpose of The Hours? A shared love of Virginia Wolff? No plot, no climax, no \\"anything.\\" It was a waste of<br />my hour to read it.
B00005RHGK|5.0|This movie was off the chains.I am a person who does not get scared but i gotta jeepers creepers props though. though i was the only one not ready to pee in my pants, i did jump quit a few times.  you will never want to hear that song again. best scary movie-----p.s. you have to follow the movie or else you&quot;ll be lost.
B00003CXA6|1.0|Gettysburg and its director Ronald F. Maxwell proudly wear their &quot;historical accuracy&quot; on their sleeves.  The result?  The story moves like it really is unfolding second-for-second, the characters yak on and on about inconsequential details, and the central narrative thrust is -- well, there isn't one.<br />I don't think I've ever been as bored by any war film.  Even historical essays make for a more exciting experience.  Maxwell's characters refer endlessly to small details, yet we are never told what those details mean in the grand scheme of things.  Worst of all, there is never any conflict -- the root of all works of drama.  The stakes are low, there is endless talk and little action, and when the battle scenes do occur, they are perhaps the most lifeless ever filmed.  The charge down the hill, for example, was referred to as a suicidal gesture, yet the Union soldiers simply seem to waltz right through their enemy without any sense of danger.  Maxwell simply has no idea how to either write or direct a good, tense dramatic scene.<br />Miserable acting caps the whole deal off.  Martin Sheen has never looked more ridiculous as here, ironically, where he plays Robert E. Lee, one of the most charismatic generals in U.S. history and certainly one of the Civil War's figureheads.  Tom Berenger's performance could have been given by any number of bit players.  Even on the music front the film is an utter failure.  The usually resourceful Randy Edelman's score somehow sounds entirely anachronistic, possibly due to a generic orchestral arrangement without specific flavour, and there is entirely too much of it, as if Maxwell is trying to rely on the music to generate some kind of interest.  And he is -- trying, that is, and failing miserably.<br />I feel insulted when this film is compared to -- and, horrifically, sometimes even cited above -- the 1989 Civil War classic Glory, which featured an immortal performance from Denzel Washington and astonishing writing, directing, cinematography, editing, sound, and music.  And Glory took a little over two hours to say oceans more about the Civil War than Gettysburg does in its entire four-hour running length.  Don't even rent this, unless you're a fan of gross ineptitude and historical accuracy above dramatic interest.  This is as bad as filmmaking gets.
0790733226|1.0|That sounds harsh. If anything it's generous.<br />Undoubtedly the worst part of this awful remake of an excellent, thought proving book is at the end, where in big letters it comes up with the words \\"For Carl\\".<br />At that point I nearly threw something at the screen.<br />Carl Sagan was an atheist. Contact, the book, contains some intelligent, thought provoking, discussions between two of the main characters ; the atheist Arroway, and the Christian Joss. The \\"extremist\\" views on both sides are represented by Drumlin and Rankin. Rankin, as far as I can see, has been removed altogether. Most of the discussions between the two main characters have been rewritten so that the balance becomes blatantly pro-religion. For example, at one point, the Joss character asks Arroway \\"Did you love your father - prove it\\" which is the asinine kind of thing an asinine religious person would ask ; and absolutely not the kind of thing the Palmer Joss character in the book would ask.<br />Worse still is the end of the film. In the book, Arroway is basically paid off and hushed up. In the film, there is a big set piece investigation in which Arroway is asked \\"questions\\" - this is an unsubtle piece of propoganda in favour of religious faith.<br />Back to \\"For Carl\\". Carl Sagan ; the author I've read in Contact and various other books would have disowned this movie, and probably stopped it. Hence the title.<br />Does it matter ? If you like dumb movies, probably not, it then just becomes are rather pointless low level action flick. But then again, you might as well by a Schwarzenegger film for that.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|At last new music that is actually good.  I bought this CD based on word of mouth and on the audio samples on Amazon.  boy the girls can sing and their songs are so catchy to boot.  \\"All the things she said,\\" \\" show me love,\\" and \\"stars,\\" are my favorite tracks but I do not touch the skip button at all when I pop in this CD.  ...  At least we don't have another Britny clone parading before us thinking she can sing.  These two girls however can really belt out a toon.  I liked it so much I bought it for a friend as well.  He can't stop singing the songs either.  Hope the girls are around for a long time to come.  Buy it and listen, you'll soon be singing and dancing.
B000003CMB|5.0|The Allman Brother's first live album is indeed one of the greatest live transfers of studio material to a stage in the genre, and to all the youths out there who think today's rock artists like The Strokes and White Stipes and the Vines are all there is need to listen to this pronto. Recorded right before Duane Allman's motorcycle demise, this captures their spirit, timing, and excellence. Worth it just for \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" and the over-powering \\"Whipping Post\\", though the other tracks are splendid pieces as well.
038572179X|4.0|This was a pretty good book.  The way it was written was a tad slow going at times but the story line made you read on.  I like how it had the transitions between time periods.  They were very smooth.  This is a book you could easily take your time with.
B000059T00|5.0|Blind Faith was undoubtedly one of Rock's finest ensembles- after Cream broke up, drummer and guitarist Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton decided to team up with Steve Winwood of Traffic and Richard Grech, to make this self-titled album. \\"Had to Cry Today\\" and \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" are obvious masterpieces of the crossbreed of blues/rock, and the other three, \\"Well Alright\\", \\"Presence of the Lord\\" and \\"Sea of Joy\\" are treats of classic rock that don't get much radio play. HOWEVER, \\"Do What You Like\\", which starts off well, is indeed the only flaw on the album, as that it goes on for 15 minutes and half of it sounds like tuning and fiddling around and doesn't hold up against the test of time. Still, this is must listen to anyone who has an apprectiation of rock music, or music in general.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I really like this CD...but am I the only one who thinks John Mayer must be related to Michael Franks, soft Jazz singer popular in the late 70's, early 80's? Similar voices...same rhythms.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Ms. Jones has a voice that will break your heart.  Like most people, &quot;Don't know why&quot; caught my attenion, but the whole cd is great.  The music maintains a constant mellow tone through all the tracks.  One criticism I've heard is that she has little vocal range.  But it's truly a non-issue, because, for some reason, she has the uncanny ability to change the mood of each song while maintaining her trademark sulty voice.   Whether it's the heartbreakingly mellow &quot;One flight down&quot; or the nostalgic undertones of &quot;Lonestar&quot;,  Norah Jones is sure to stay in your CD player for awhile.
B00002E23E|2.0|During the 70's Led Zeppelin were the kings of rock, not only that, but they put on a good show. Now I'm a huge Zeppelin fan, so when I give it 2 stars, you know it sucks. When I purchased this DVD I frankly expected more. I (being a guitarist) expected to see Jimmy Page in all his glory thrashing out riffs for everybody. Instead, i get Jimmy playing at his sloppiest. Robert Plant keeps saying \\"push, push\\" during every song which is, quite frankly, disturbing. John Paul Jones and John Bonham sound great, but stand behind Robert and Jimmy like statues (which I guess is okay). Robert, Jimmy, John, and JPJ all look tired and worn out. To put it, they look lazy. Add to this the annoying \\"dream sequences\\" and there you have it. I expected a Zeppelin concert, not a freaky LSD trip.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. finally makes its way to DVD via two versions, the original theatrical cut and the 2002 remastered and retouched version that director Steven Spielberg revisited.  I must confess, the differences between the two versions are minimal, reminding me of how well done the effects were the first time around.  Still, the subtle added touches that have been incorporated into the 2002 cut, while I don't feel add anything fresh to the enjoyment of the film, nevertheless, don't detract from its enjoyment either.  Hello George Lucas, are you getting any of this?<BR>Universal has done a masterful job with the transfer of both editions.  Shadow delineation and contrast are superbly rendered.  Colors are well balanced.  The soundtrack has been marvelously restored with John Williams' memorable score jumping out of the speakers in this 5.1 remix.  The extras include a making of documentary and some fluff regarding the reissue.  Candid moments caught by the documentary reveal that neither Henry Thomas or Drew Barrymore looking thrilled to be revisiting the film, perhaps because neither's career reached quite so high after the original theatrical engagement.  Oh, well, this is definitely a nice job by Universal and well worth the wait.
6305308659|5.0|For those people who found this movie &quot;morally repugnant,&quot; I suggest watching the movie once more, and pay attention this time.  It's true that it is clearly made from a liberal perspective and  this point of view is pervasive throughout the movie, but never are anarchy and amorality presented as options for living in the perfect world.  Indeed, the opening of the movie--which takes place in the present--is about how our &quot;liberal&quot; world has failed us in many ways: economic downturns, AIDS, global warming, broken families, etc.  The TV show &quot;Pleasantville&quot; stands in stark contrast to the present, with its 1950s wholesome values and bygone charm.  But when the main characters go into the world of Pleasantville, they see that the grass is always greener on the other side (this time literally): the small town life of the 1950s is too small in many ways.  They bring modern day values to the small town, and everyone lives happily ever after.... But they also learn that what was valued in the simpler past still holds much promise for us, especially in the &quot;bleak&quot; present.<br />Granted, it's preachy at points and sometimes trite in its message; but one thing it's not is one-sided.    The point of the movie is that both time periods have their pros and cons: strong morals vs. amorality, closed-mindedness vs. acceptance, etc.  Neither is perfect, and both can be improved by borrowing the best of the other.  There is no perfect time and no ideal life; it's all what we make of it.  It's understandable how some can view the movie as only promoting our more modern values of acceptance and freedom of lifestyles, but an active watcher will understand the balance the movie strikes, and it does so quite well.<br />(And now some direct rebuttals for lindlas: <BR>The last scene on the bench is not a weird three-some; don't take it so literally.  And in regards to the statement &quot;All the same if you are a human, and love being a human, and allthe beauty that comes with being one, than don't watch this movie&quot;: your ignorance to the entire point of the movie (and to grammar) is laid bare in that single statement.  Congratulations.)
B000067J1Q|3.0|Why anyone would want to view this classic in full frame is beyond me.  Shot in Panavision 70, the glorious vistas of the Alps and Austrian countryside are breathtakingly captured.  And then, of course, there's Julie Andrews.  From her introduction, twirling about the tip of a hillside, to her whimsical \\"My Favorite Things\\" Ms. Andrews is one of the cinema's  great guilty pleasures, a wholesome, smart and funloving girl next door that anyone would be happy to have as either their mother or girlfriend - depending on one's age.  <BR>Fox previously issued this film as a \\"Five Star Edition\\".  Here, you don't get the fabulous extras, including a wonderful documentary on the history of the film and the Von Trapps.  But no matter which version you get, you can't escape the fact that this transfer, although better than the laserdisc or VHS versions previously issued, still has a long way to go to live up to the very best DVD transfers.  There is considerable digital noise in the backgrounds, some color smearing and a bit of edge enhancement and fine detail shimmering to contend with.  Though it doesn't necessarily distract, it is present throughout and does draw attention to itself, particularly if you are viewing the film on a screen 32 inches or greater.  The soundtrack has been nicely restored though at moments it can have a strident sonic characteristic that is slightly grating. Overall, Fox needs to revisit this title with a new transfer.  Still, no one can deny that the hills will continue to be alive with the sounds of music for many, many years to come.
B000059PR5|3.0|Propaganda films can make for interesting movies and can leave lasting impressions (the propaganda films of Hitler's Third Reich still influence movie makers to this day). However, most of the time, they are boring and fail to do educate or impact their audiences. As a propaganda movie, THE DAY AFTER succeeded brilliantly. When the movie first aired on television in 1983, it caused a national border-line panic about the possibility of nuclear war. The acting is well done and the special effects were great for an early 80's television movie.<br /><br />Fast forward to the present day. Though a nuclear attack is still a possibility, it probably wouldn't be in the form of the total annihilation depicted in THE DAY AFTER. The Soviet Union no longer exists and the evil empire is no longer communism, but the unseen threat of terrorism. Not only that, but I watched THE DAY AFTER as a child when it first aired and none of the grahic images ever stayed with me (TESTAMENT was the movie that still haunts me to this day).<br /><br />THE DAY AFTER, though still graphic, no longer pulls the punches it once did. It is a period propaganda piece. Not only that, but it really doesn't make for very good home viewing either--the film has a large cast and suffers from a miniseries-type mood, but with a depressing tone. If you really want to watch a moving, haunting film about the devastation of a nuclear explosion watch TESTAMENT, that's a film you will never forget. THE DAY AFTER is a film better used for historical purposes.
B00000F14B|5.0|Robert Preston will always be the music man.  This poignant, hilarious and tuneful musical captivated audiences during a decade of anti-heroes, drug culture exploration and realism cinema, proving that no matter the age, fantasy will always have a place in the hearts and minds of film goers.  Preston is Professor Harold Hill, a con artist who arrives in the nimbled-headed town of River City, determined to brainwash its citizens with the prospect of purchasing a boy's band which, of course, he's more than willing to sell to them.  However, on this trip Harold falls for Marianne the librarian (Shirley Jones), a stuck up spinster whose heart melts like butter on the persuasive powers of the con man's band leading baton.  How does it all come out - with fanfare and music and Buddy Hackett puffing on a tuba. Don't ask!<BR>Warner Home Video has done a fantastic job remastering this film for DVD.  Colors are sharp, bold and well balanced. The anamorphic transfer captures all of the beauty and feel good vibrations of the score and performances.  The 5.1 mix is a nice touch.  There's also a documentary hosted by Shirley Jones that does a fine job of summing things up as well as giving one a history of the production shoot.  Definitely a must have.
0876855575|4.0|Even though 'Ham on Rye' is listed as a novel it is also well understood to be a thinly disguised autobiography of the author's early life (until his early 20s).  This worried me since I don't like autobiographical material because its singular focus on the author.  Having said all this, 'Ham on Rye' is such a detailed horror story that, like looking at an auto accident, you can't help but be drawn in.<br />Our main character is raised during the depression by an absolutely horrific father and doormat of a mother.  The guy is also plagued with a complexion from hell, and seems to be in a bad need of a hug (yet no one wants to get near him).  Besides he completely fights off anything that resembles affection or friendship.  Not surprisingly this dysfunctional young man grows into a dysfunctional adult.<br />What makes this book distinctive is the author's rather decent writing skills and his complete lack of self-pity.  The story is heartbreaking but the main character carries on, like a stray mongrel wandering the streets.  Depressing, terribly depressing.  But it is a story that should be read, especially by fathers who never spare the rod lest he spoil the child.<br />Bottom line: sometimes depressing books should be considered as mandatory reading material.  This is one of them.
B00005JKG7|4.0|John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\" retains something of its original unsettling atmosphere for me even after twenty years.  There's just something creepy about the film and the natural phenomenon that slinks into Antonio Bay on the eve of its 100 year anniversary, to terrorize citizens with the ghosts of evil deeds past.  <BR>Jamie Lee Curtis is in the film but she isn't really the star in the sense that she was in Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\".  Spoiler - this film doesn't match \\"Halloween\\" in terror value so if you've never seen it and think you'll be scared stupid, think again.  Still, \\"The Fog\\" remains an unsettling treck into the night where ghosts roam the earth in search of treasure and revenge.  The scene with Mrs. Cobrits and the little boy (if you've seen the film before you know exactly what I'm talking about) still gives me sweaty palms.<BR>MGM DVD has remastered the film in 5.1.  Although the anamorphic transfer is a marked improvement over previous issues on laserdisc and VHS there are still a few cases where visual information gets lost in the darkest scenes.  Also, film grain is obtrusive in several scenes.  Color fidelity is dated but nicely rendered.  At its best \\"The Fog\\" exhibits sharp images with good definition and color clarity.  At its worst, there's a momentary loss of fine detail and shadow and contrast delineation.  Also includes a documentary and featurette and theatrical trailer.  Overall, great job and well worth the money.  Just make sure you lock your doors and windows before you watch it.
B000005ALP|5.0|The eels have always been known for great music which is generally restricted to a small minority group known as college rockers, however with there latest 'Beautiful Freak' the eels have propelled themselves into the broader picture. While bands on their peer level remain smothered in teenage angst the eels have grown up and now lead the way with music such as Novacaine for the soul. 5 out of 5 cause its worth it ;)
630522577X|5.0|By the time Lerner &amp; Loewe's &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; made it to the big screen it was not so much a film as it became a theatrical event.  Jack L. Warner saw to it that his fair lady had a grand gala premiere and all the bells and whistles befitting one of the last truly great Hollywood musicals to emerge from the studio system.  In the role he made famous on Broadway, Rex Harrison defined the stoggy old professor, Henry Higgins.  As the cockney flower girl transformed into a vision of loveliness, Audrey Hepburn is absolutely adorable.  Stanley Holloway, Mona Washburn, Gladys Cooper and Wilfred Hyde-Pierce are outstanding.<BR>Warner Home Video has done themselves proud with this DVD release.  Restored and remaster to 5.1 stereo, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; comes to life in a brilliant anamorphic widescreen transfer that leaves one applauding for more.  I have to say that one viewing of this movie is not enough and that with each renewed visit my respect for director, George Cukor grows even more.<br />My one complaint, Warner Brothers didn't own the rights to &quot;More Loverly Than Ever&quot; a fascinating documentary on the making and restoration of My Fair Lady that was included on the deluxe laserdisc box set put out by CBS/Fox back in the early 90's.  This is a companion piece that is essential to appreciating the film as a true work of art and if Warner knows what's good (and they most certainly have proven that they do indeed) they should make every effort to acquire the documentary and revisit this title at a later date in a 2-disc special edition.  But the movie, as presented here, is a rare treat among DVD-philes, a wonderful blend of sight and song that is absolutely impossible to resist. Get this one.

B00004R9A4|4.0|Bedknobs and Broomsticks is the charming tale of Eglintine Price(Angela Lansbury), an apprentice witch who is determined to use her cosmic powers to bring World War II to a successful conclusion.  In her efforts she is aided by three London refugee children and a con artist, Professor Emilius Brown (David Tomlinson).  The original film was envisioned as a grand musical along the same lines as Mary Poppins.  But the New York Christmas premiere at Radio City proved to be a problem, since the theater's Christmas Show preceeding the film meant that the length of the film itself had to be chopped to conform to time restrictions.  This conflict of interest lead to three songs and some extemporanious footage being left on the cutting room floor.  I am pleased to say that, three decades later, nearly everything that was taken out has been put back in, with a new digital transfer that positively sparkles and stereophonic sound that will make your heart sing.  Only Angela Lansbury's &quot;Step in the Right Direction&quot; musical solo seems to have been lost for all time.  But the newly restored &quot;Portibello Road&quot; dance sequence and Lansbury's &quot;Nobody's Problem For Me&quot; are revelations, rounding out story and content in ways that only now can we truly appreciate for their genius and scope.  Disney's efforts have dug up a fair bit of background information, wonderfully included as supplimentary material, fascinating and delightful.  A must have disc for anyone who wants to spend a rainy night in front of the television with a great family film that sparkles as never before.
B00005JLSC|5.0|This is one of the best and most entertaining movies produced in years!  Set in the 1920s it tells the story of a show-biz wannabe (Rene Zellweger) who kills her lover in a fit of rage and pairs her in prison with a bigtime cabaret star (Catherine Zeta Jones) who killed her husband and sister when she caught them in bed together.  Richard Gere is their attorney and, remembering him for roles like An Officer and a Gentleman, American Gigolo, Pretty Woman and Internal Affairs, it was interesting to see him as a song and dance man.  The Cell block and Press Conference numbers are outstanding, but so is the rest of the show. Deserves every Oscar it gets.  A must own!!!
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is the most agressive band I probably know so far. Slipknot is one of my favourite heavy metal bands. This album is slightly better than their second album, = Iowa. This one is excellent. This is Heavy Metal / Horror / Rap. The horror part is really well done with good samples and synth work, theres lots of scratching and some songs the lead singer raps, and of course its mostly agressive loud well done heavy metal, using the infamous Mike Thompson on lead guitar with his BC Rich guitar. Their style is unique = Using 9 people, they can get the fastest drums you'll ever hear, theres never a moment of silence, they tend to start of the sounds from the left hand side and then bring it to the right, which is a very good combo. Overall this album is very good.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This is a really cool cd. If you like Fleetwood Mac, then you will love it. If you don't like Fleetood Mac, then you will love it. I especially like the songs &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot;, and &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, because Rhiannon is my name. This cd has two disks (double the fun!) Just buy the cd, you won't be disapointed.
B00000JLWW|2.0|As one of the greatest blockbuster hits ever to come out of Hollywood, one would expect more from the DVD.  The DVD, especially from Fox DVD, is sub par.   It contains no special features, and the quality is so-so.  I would wait until a special edition (which almost assuredly will come) arrives on the scene.  The DVD just does not do the movie the justice that it deserves; it is one more example of a DVD made without any real care or thought.  Do yourself a favor and wait for another version.
0783114222|4.0|Simply the best and most comprehensive program.  Hanks approaches this story from an angle never thought of.  He takes the most critical part of each mssions and details it.  As the 10 episodes unfold you have the story of a complete mission from a to z.  Hanks is a genius.....GET this DVD set if you are a moon fan.  Get this DVD so your kids can find out what we had to do to get to the moon and back without killing the people who went.  It is an historical monument to the endevour.  It is a history lesson that is fun to learn.
B00005ATQ9|2.0|Like most Stanley Kubrick devotees, I was shocked by the awfulness of  &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; when it was first released, but chalked it up to a great director exhausted by the effort required to make &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;2001.&quot;  But the release of &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; gave the first clues that Kubrick was suffering some kind of mental disturbance, and he never got over it. The film is a totally aimless realization of a little-regarded Thackeray novel, and Kubrick's detachment from the story is total.  He reportedly was consumed by the technical challenge of filming by candlelight and bringing some of his favorite 18th century paintings to life.  Poor Ryan O'Neal is rooted to the spot in scene after scene, forbidden by the director to move a millimeter for fear of spoiling the composition.It was revealed with time that Kubrick had wanted, after filming &quot;2001,&quot; to make a movie biography of Napoleon.  He talked of mustering 50,000 extras and 10,000 horses for some battle scenes.  The studios quite rightly said no, and poor Kubrick frittered away the last 30 years of his life on nonsense like &quot;Barry Lyndon,&quot; a sad document.
0812550757|5.0|This was my introduction to Card. I read Ender's Game so I could read this. The mystery of the killings and the trees makes the whole story go.<br />I have read most of Card's SF by now and some of his fantasy. I'd love to see him outdo this work but I fear he never will.
B00000I924|4.0|Who Else! marks an impressive return by the master of guitar- Jeff Beck. It seems to be generally agreed here that Who Else! is not one of Jeff's best (Wired, You Had It Coming) and I tend to agree with that. However, Who Else! is well worth the money you have to pay for it, and any fan of Jeff's should definately own this disc.<br />&quot;What Mamma Said&quot; is an explosive opener to an explosive disc. Here we are introduced to Jennifer Batten, Jeff's composing and second guitarist/midi keyboard partner. However this song is only a blueprint on what's to come. &quot;Psycho Sam&quot; could not have been named more perfectly, and has a perfect postition on the disc (after an explosive tune and before &quot;Brush with the Blues&quot;). More great playing is shown by Jeff, and it is probably one the best tunes that Tony Hymas has written for him. Next we come to the amazing &quot;Brush With the Blues.&quot; Any guitarist should listen, absorb, and learn what Jeff is playing on this song. The solo is astounding and cannot be put into words. The band's dynamics are very strong, and that makes this song very effective to the listener. Here we will skip to &quot;Space for the Papa,&quot; another highlight. Jeff displays maginifcent dynamics and slide playing here, which extends into the emotion &quot;Angel (Footsteps).&quot; Jeff plays notes that aren't even on the fretboard, and the solo can cause you to weep. The most emotional song on this disc is &quot;Declan&quot; though. There are many exotic instruments in this Irish cover, and Jeff can really put a lump in your throat with this one. The album has it's rough spots, such as &quot;THX 138,&quot; but even those are worth listening to and do not make this a bad album at all. &quot;Another Place&quot; is a quiet closer for a loud disc, and Jeff's playing is graceful and elegant here. <br />Overall, buy this disc. It's worth it.
B00005JLKN|5.0|RED DRAGON is one of the best movies if its year, and provides a wonderful capper for the Lecter trilogy.  I know that there are a great many fans of MANHUNTER who still feel that it is a better movie, but I am definitely not one of them.  Brian Cox is a wonderful actor, but he never captured the true malevolence of Lecter, only his remarkable stillness.  Anthony Hopkins is simply (in the words of the NY Times) \\"the best [screen] actor working in [film] today.\\"  Even though Lecter is a minor character in the the original novel, you remember him long after putting the book down.  Anthony Hopkins does the same thing for Lecter in the movies.  If it hadn't been for the inevitable comparisons between the two films, Brian Cox would hardly be remembered at all for his portrayal of Lecter.  Although Tom Noonan is especially creepy as the villain of MANHUNTER, Ralph Fiennes equals, if not exceeds, his creepiness, and Ed Norton brings everything you would expect from an actor of his calibur.  This movie is simply a MUST SEE, and I can't wait until the DVD arrives.
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck has been my favorite guitar player for a long time. I am familiar with all of his albums, and they are all great. However, You Had It Coming has made it to the top of my list. It is not only my favorite Jeff Beck album, it is one of my favorite overall albums of all time. Words cannot even describe this masterpiece, but I will sure try.<br />When I first the opening track &quot;Earthquake,&quot; I was hooked. Jeff's tone and technique were so massive, and he injected so much soul and feeling into his playing as well. &quot;Earthquake&quot; may be a heavy rocker, but it isn't brain damaging because Jeff injects an emotional quality into his playing that mere mortals can't do. The solo in this song is awesome. After the break, Jeff explodes with awesome phrasing, tapping, harmonics, and typical Beckisms which make this solo among the best on the CD. Many musicians as they get older tend to mellow out. Jeff just plays harder and better than he ever has before, and the result is amazing. Anyone into great grooves fused with great guitar playing should listen to &quot;Roy's Toy.&quot; Jeff's solo in this song is also a modern classic, as his phrasing leaves me speechless every time. This is a song for the motorhead and groove oriented person, as well as anyone into astounding guitar playing. &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; is one of the highlights of this disc and is probably the coolest wah-wah pedal song ever. Mr. Beck's solo in this song leaves you speechless, which isn't a surprise by now, huh? &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot; is a pleasant surprise with great vocals by Imogene Heap and great playing by Jeff. The climactic solo in the middle is, quite simply, awesome. The standout of You Had It Coming is &quot;Nadia.&quot; This song is definately a modern classic, and words cannot describe what a masterpiece &quot;Nadia&quot; is. Jeff's sound is amazing, his playing is amazing, and so is the song itself. The backing instruments are very effective here as well. Jeff's use of bottleneck, fingers, and whammy bar here is inhuman and godlike, and the emotion he injects into &quot;Nadia&quot; really touches the soul. &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; is the perfect follow up as Beck shows how tough his playing can really be. This song is one of the harmonic highlights of the album, and his solo(s) here are mesmerizing. The funky &quot;Rosebud&quot; proves the theory that less is more as Jeff perfectly executes this well crafted piece. He proves with &quot;Left Hook&quot; that more is more with a solo at the end that makes you sweat. &quot;Blackbird&quot; is the most unique song ever done, as he duets with a bird. Who else has ever jammed with a bird? His licks here are amazing as always and it features some of his best slide playing. &quot;Suspension&quot; is a graceful and lyrical ending to a perfect album, and Jeff really sings here. Once again, the backing instruments are very effective. Wow.<br />As said before, this is my favorite Jeff Beck album, bar none. The others are amazing, but none of them are like You Had It Coming. Any lover of guitar playing or music in general should not be without this album. Jeff Beck is the best, and this album really proves it.

0553278223|4.0|This was a very light and insightful read in my opinion. It prods at the five mark, but can not quite pull me there completly. Here's why:<BR> Ray Bradbury successfully weaves together a series of short stories all revolving around Mars and the progression of time from man's first landing on it's surface, to his last. Adjusting to the Mars that Bradbury colorfully conjures up was slightly tedious for me as a reader. I found this to be the case because when Bradbury first had the book published it was true Science Fiction and although far-fetched, had a firm base in scientific knowledge of the Red Planet at the time. In the year 2003, that knowledge is anachronistic. There are no little men on Mars building canal systems and furthering their race on the science of the martian mind. If you are a reader that can actually overlook fact and lose yourself in the fantasy (since it truthfully can not be called a science fiction), you will finish it knowing that you have chanced upon some very profound truths illustrated in a very unusual manner. Bradbury (coined a poet by his compatriot Aldous Huxley) does a brilliant job of illumining the inherent self-destructiveness of mankind and how this can not only destroy the lives of others, but make less meaningful individual lives as well. Read it, you'll be a more self-aware human being because of it, and you will be entertained and awed by the spectrum of emotion that Bradbury adeptly draws his readers through. And....If you like H.G. Wells and get a kick out of the alien phenomenon in literature at that time, you'll absolutely adore &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot;
6304118392|2.0|I didn't care for this movie. I realize that Oliver Stone was trying to make a point about society, but he painted a very pessimistic view where people seemed to revel in being rebellious. There are virtually no sympathetic characters in this movie. If you want to watch utter chaos and nonsense, tape South Park.
0553212737|5.0|Matchmaker, Matchmaker,<BR>Make me a match,<BR>Find me a find,<BR>Catch me a catch,<BR>Night after night in the dark I'm alone<BR>So find me a match,<BR>Of my own.<br />- Fiddler on the Roof<br />In this romance, all the married characters are perfectly matched: Mr. and Mrs. Weston, John and Isabella Knightley, the reverend and his wife, and the list goes on. No wonder there is a friendly cupid in the village: Emma Woodhouse. This story explores the different aspects of love.<br />Harriet Smith is Emma's friend. Miss Smith falls in love with three men in one year; quite a record even for Highbury. Hardly a flirt, Harriet Smith's heart is pure and indestructible. Bad advice makes her ditch Robert Martin, but a chance encounter reveals that her feelings for him are unchanged. \\"Unconditional\\" is the best word for this kind of love.<br />Mr. Knightley's love is unrequited. For years he's been longing for a woman out of reach. And Emma does not even know she is in love. She only finds out when Harriet lays claim to the one man her heart desires.<br />And the case of Mr. Woodhouse reveals a bizarre and unhealthy obsession. He refuses to believe his family and servants can ever find happiness away from Hartfield. But this actually reveals his own dependent form of love. When Emma marries he won't let her leave the house, so unfortunately her husband has to move in till Mr. Woodhouse dies.<br />But it is not a tale of love unless the green-eyed-monster makes an appearance. Emma's jealousy is the most obvious. Jane plays the piano better than she does. Jane does almost everything better than Emma. It is no wonder that Highbury's most eligible bachelor is enraptured by this pale beauty. Needless to say, Jane Fairfax is an infrequent visitor at Hartfield.<br />Miss Fairfax in turn discovers her jealousy of Emma at Box Hill, when Emma flirts loudly with a man who unbeknownst to her, is Jane's secret lover. Jane decides to break all ties with Emma. This might have been the bestplan, because until matters turn right, sickness makes Jane paler than ever which may frighten visitors.<br />But perhaps the worst culprit is Mr. Knightley whose disparaging remarks concerning Frank Churchill at first seem to be the wise counsel of a man of the world. Frank found true love as a young man while Mr. Knightley is fast approaching middle age unable or unwilling to find someone to marry. His constant criticism of Frank ends abruptly when he finds a woman willing to marry him.<br />Highbury's cupid is in some ways similar to Jane Austen. They both are strong independent women who believe that marriage with the right person can create happiness. This is a light read. For the most part, Austen avoids physical description in favor of dialogue. It is amazing how depth of character can be portrayed this way. Jane Austen's ability to make fiction appear real is a rare talent.
B00005JKHP|4.0|Possibly one of the most hyped movies of the late '70s, the first Star Trek movie quickly turned out to be The Motion*less* Picture. Drawn out scenes, little action, and drab uniforms have made the first Trek movie a tool for insomniacs everywhere ever since its initial video release.<br />Now, Paramount, in finally releasing the movie to DVD, has allowed Robert Wise to re-edit the film, something that he really didn't have time to do thanks to time constraints. Some scenes from the extended \\"TV version\\" are present, and some scenes from the original cut have been excised to help the movie along. Perhaps the best changes, though, have been to the audio track and certain effects scenes. Gone is the droning \\"red Alert\\" voice (with the matching sirens), replaced with the sirens from the original series. The revisioned effects are no more than what was possible in 1979 (although done in CGI), and bring life to some of the clunkier moments of the film (Spock's Kolinahr and the Enterprise's \\"docking\\" onto the central area of V'Ger in particular).<br />What *is* sorely lacking, though, is the original cut of the film (as nauseating as it is, it's still the original film). All of the missing and changed scenes are in the special features disc, but it's not enough, and it spoils an almost perfect package. Still, if you've seen the first movie, you owe it to yourself to at least rent this disc.
B000031XCR|5.0|I love Celine Dion, I bought a cd from her for the first time on 1997, when &quot;Because you loved me&quot; (from &quot;Falling into you&quot;)was very strong and I just felt in love with the cd. Then came the success of Titanic and I bought her next cd, &quot;Let's talk about love&quot; and was also great but I have to admit that I like more &quot;Falling into you&quot;.<BR>On december 1999 I saw this cd and I bought it, and I discovered great songs from years before that I when heard them when they were new, I didn't know that they were from Celine, I'm talking about songs like: &quot;The power of love&quot;, &quot;If you ask me to&quot; or &quot;Beauty and the beast&quot;.<BR>If you like Celine Dion I strongly recomment this cd. The songs are great, it also includes &quot;Because you loved me&quot; and my own favorite &quot;It's all coming back to me now&quot; (it's a pitty that they didn't add the long version) and of course one of Celine's best songs, &quot;To love you more&quot;.<BR>Celine also add to this production some new songs, such as the 1999 hit &quot;That's the way it is&quot; and &quot;If this walls could talk&quot; and the digitally new version of Frank Sinatra next to Celine &quot;All the way&quot;.<BR>Other songs that are in this cd is the Grammy nominated duet with R.Kelly &quot;I'm your angel&quot; and the 1993 smash &quot;Love can move mountains&quot;. Another song on this album is one that is very important in Celine's career, the song has beautiful lyrics and is a good song but I can't hear it anymore more because i heard it back in 1998 like one thousand times, the song is &quot;My heart will go on&quot; from Titanic.<BR>There is something that I must say, it's not good when a song is always on air, I mean radio stations or tv music stations.<BR>So I think that this is all I can say about Celine Dion because the rest is history.<BR>By the way if you like this cd, you must but Celine's 2002 cd &quot;A new day has come&quot; for me this is Celine's best with hits such as: &quot;I'm alive&quot;, my favorite song and the 2002 smashing #1 hit &quot;A new day has come&quot;.
B00005B36H|3.0|Tool's debut album &quot;Undertow&quot; was a rather uninteresting and draged on a bit, its successor &quot;Aenima&quot; was an extremely awkward and uneven attempt at mystical hard rock and metal.<br />Five years on, Lateralus shows a band that has matured slightly by avoiding most of the pitfalls of the previous albums. For one Tool have returned to a more straight forward approach similar to that of Undertow. Unlike that release Tool has added more structure and variety to the formula - songs have a bit more breathing space and quite moments before erupting again. Some slight eastern influences are apparent , the drumming is good and Maynard tries to sing a little more than on previous albums. Thank god that they dropped the filler segments that plagued Aenima.<br />This album and band still has its fair share of problems. The songs are long and a lot of them drag on in similar fashion to Undertow. This album is very long and guitarist Adam Jones is still stuck repeating similar riffs as in previous releases. Most apparent is that after a decade together, Tool's formula is very apparent and is getting tiresome. Perhaps if this album was called Aenima and released 5 years ago I would be less harsh.<br />Still, this is Tools most cohesive and complete release to date, although there is nothing compelling about it to induce repeated listening.
B0000844I8|1.0|Yes this is a magnificent re-mastering of the film.<BR>Yes, the directors cut is superb.<br />No, I am not happy with this DVD at all and here's why:<br />But all that falls short when I pop the DVD in the machine and it shows  T A R G A T across the screen.  What is this? A cruel joke by TARGET?  Is this subliminal advertising? Just kidding of course, but just how many people can play 16:9 movies in their homes yet?  Is this the way all movies are going to go soon, and force us to spend thousands of dollars on an HDTV set?  I hope not.<br />The DVD is missing both sides folks, and if you don't have a 16:9 set, stick with the widescreen special edition, and save yourself the bucks and the anger.<br />D

B00005JKED|4.0|Earning Denzel Washington an Oscar for his bad guy persona, Training Day is an engaging film examining the events of one day in the life of a crooked cop and his innocent protégé.<br />At the center of the film are the on-the-spot performances of Washington and Ethan Hawke. Clearly the change in role for Denzel energized him profoundly in bringing his bad cop character to life. Though not as celebrated, Hawke is also excellent, portraying an eager Narc in training. These two grab you right in and hold you for the duration of the film.<br />The powerful story, though, is just as absorbing. Without spoiling too much, the corruption that Hawke's character witnesses through the course of the day is shocking and lands him into a situation he may not get out of alive.<br />Though the film at times falls back on some standard movie devices, overall it's fully entertaining and hard to stop watching. It's definitely a character movie to see more then once.
0684823454|4.0|For anyone unfamiliar with either Winston Churchill or William Manchester, this book provides a nice introduction to both.  Remember the name Manchester, and when you're done with this book, go immediately back to Amazon.com and buy \\"The Last Lion\\", both volumes (the third volume is not yet published, alas).<br />There are many astonishing events in Churchill's life, and one wonders at the extent of self-aggrandizement  in this book (certainly you wouldn't expect a politician to be entirely honest!).  Nevertheless, if only 1/4 of Churchill's stories were true, it would be more than enough to establish him among the icons of history.<br />That this work ends on Churchill's (first) rise to public prominence is fitting.  It is as if to say that prior to his political ascendency, Churchill's life was his own, and thus worthy of his own gifted commentary.  Whereas after he became a public figure, there was really nothing more for him to personally relate (of course, Manchester's anecdotal stories concerning Churchill's bathtime hijinks put the lie to that theory - refer to the Last Lion VII).  Not that there isn't plenty of autobiography in Churchill's other works (his history of World War II is rife with personal detail), but the tone is different, and the degree of revelation more subdued.<br />It is of incalculable benefit that we have access to such a personalized view of the childhood and formation of such a great man.  Not that he could be duplicated by applying such remedies to your own children (just add syphalitic father, sexually uninhibited but devoted mother, and healthy dose of latin lessons at exclusive English school).<br />I must confess that among the many details contained in this book, the one that I find most revealing is Churchill's daring and disastrous gambit during a childhood game of tag (a presage to Forcing the Dardanelles?).  This single incident speaks clearly to Churchill's indominatable spirit, incredible daring, and dangerous creativity.

B000002UAO|5.0|How can anyone compare any other band to Beatles.  They are the greatest band ever or ever will be.  It's been over 33 years since they stopped playing as a band.  However their music has never stopped touching people's lifes. As I sit here and listen to the Rubber Soul Album for the &quot;I can't keep count number of times&quot; it amazes me how fresh and innovative their sound was back then and still is to this day.  Their impact on the world is still evident today and their influence to music will never stop.  In my opinion they are the greatest band of all times.<BR>Remember &quot;and in the end the love you take is equal to  the love you make&quot;.
B00005NOOH|5.0|The British, for some reason, make the most wonderful documentaries -- and this is one of the best.  And DVD brings this series to the screen in crystal clarity (we already had it on VHS from when we lived in England).  You will never in a lifetime see anything as good as this on the History Channel.  It's way more engaging than anything by Ken Burns (sorry Ken).  <br />What makes this series so good, then?  Well, it has a broad span of subjects.  Britain is well covered, naturally, but the war in the pacific, north africa and other theatres is treated properly.  Olivier's voice is well suited to the material (and includes some dry british humour, eg when he describes what the soldiers could do in cairo).  But best of all, the interviews are with people who were, or were directly connected to, the powerful players in the war.  So for example we have interviews with generals in the afrika korps, and one with the planner of the attack on pearl harbor.  <br />Some reviewers have expressed concern that the series has a socialist/pacifist slant.  My family is split between democrat and republican viewers (you can imagine what happens during hannity and colmes!) and we don't see it that way.  There is a sense of the madness of war; but also the imperative.  I don't think that is socialism or pacifism.  War means your sons coming back in body bags, but sometimes a nation simply has to do it to preserve freedom and liberty for all.  The World at War points out both and lets the viewer draw their own conclusions.<br />Finally, I should point out that our version of the DVD set, purchased in Feb 2003, was perfect and did not exhibit any of the disk errors reported by other reviewers.
0671799320|5.0|\\"The Prize\\" is considered to be the \\"black bible\\" of the oil industry and not without reason. Yergin has written an outstanding book, so well researched that just the notes and bibliography together are almost 100 pages!! This book is highly deserving of the Pulitzer price.<br />Reading this book will be like an intensive course / refresher of your history knowledge of the last two centuries. The author starts back in the 19th century. The big day, 27 August 1859, the day \\"The Colonel\\" Edwin L. Drake found oil in Titusville, Texas - till just after the Golf War in 1991.<br />A book covering the last two centuries, gives us quite naturally, a large dose of world history. And many pages are dedicated to men that made a huge impact, and was an important part of this history - Nobel, Teagle, Rockefeller, \\"The Colonel\\" (Drake), Gulbenkian, and Churchill just to mention a few. Further, the author gives us an insight to the politics in the oil industry, governmental interference and how the politics in the industry works (or don't...). In lay man terms Yergin explains why and how vulnerable the industry is, about the more resent but also the past oil-crisis, how little it takes for the oil-price to spin out of control, and how the economies around the world more and more depend on the black gold.<br />Unfortunately, with its +800 pages this is not a book you accidentally pick just to have something to read. I am sure that the length of this book keeps lay readers away from it and that is a shame. It can be quite daunting project to start on, but once you have started, you will not put it away until you have finished it. I must admit that I was a little sceptical to what level the language would be on, but fear not, the book is kept on an accessible level, even for the lay reader. To the author's credit, he strikes the perfect balance between facts, technical jargon, and anecdotes, which makes \\"The Prize\\" a long, time-consuming, but nevertheless fascinating and entertaining read.<br />I found \\"The Prize\\" to be a great overview over the industry. I picked up lots and lots of new facts from this book, and I am certain that I will cite this book in the future. On a personal note, I wish the author would update the book with more than a new preface. A few more chapters to include the last decade as well would be highly welcome.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to fill in on the knowledge of the oil industry.ing read.<br />I found \\"The Prize\\" to be a great overview over the industry.

B00006AUIG|5.0|An abandoned asylum is great as a stage for a scary move. The only thing I have against this movie is that the creepy asylum isn't used more. There are some tunnel scenes that made me hide behind the couch, but not much more. Still, the whole dark atmosphere of the movie is great. <br />The characters are not your standard guys labeled Bad or Good, but just a bunch of normal people. This fact alone makes this move special from most other [bad] \\"scary\\" movies.<br />You also need to do some thinking to appreciate this one, it wont tell you everything straight out. I guess people who enjoys the common hack n slash horror flicks wont enjoy this one much. There are actually no monsters or ghosts here, just humans, which shows to be scary enough....
B000002GF8|4.0|.....It's wonderful to see an artist, or group of artists, call it quits at their peak. I never liked this band...much. De Doo Doo Doo, well..it's [bad]! And the 1st time I heard them, they sounded like a cross between The Clash and a testosterone filled Go Go's. However with Synch, I said to myself, \\"self, take a listen to this\\". For years I had been saying that Summers was an awesome ax man, he was just with the wrong band (sort of like Hendrix...if he would have had a decent band, and kept his mouth closed...the man could NOT sing). The weakest track is Every Breath You Take. It's tolerable, but the rest of the album is SPECTACULAR!! Great guitar work by Summers on King of Pain, as well as II. I also met a very special lady at the same time this album was released, so I have a very personal reason for loving this album. I wonder what ever happened to her. Anyways, this is The Police at their peak, at their most turbulent, and their most artistic. Perhaps someday I'll get another Police album and check them out a bit more (If I can get past De Doo Doo Dah).
B00005YXZH|5.0|Ignore the other bad reviews, they MUST BE pretty ignorant music lovers.<br />This CD is brilliant. Striking chords, lovely melodies and such a great voice. Buy it today (listen to the samples) you wont be sorry.<br />-B
B00005YW4H|4.0|OK, you saw the Grammys, or like me, you've heard this wonderfully deep, melodic voice over and over again on the radio station for grownups in your town...and decided you ought to look it up on the Internet.  Stop reading this now.  Buy the CD. Relax. Enjoy.
B00005JKNC|5.0|When I first saw this movie while flipping through the channels on cable I didn't think I would like it, but I ended up watching it till the end and liked it a lot. To me, it shows the meaning of what one person can do to affect the lives of others. Peter Appleton loses his memory in a car accident and everyone thinks he is a war hero who's been missing for several years. People in the town who are sad about World War 2 losses get hope again. But Pete gets his memory back, will he stay in the town or not? Watch it and see, you'll love the movie.
B00007L4OM|2.0|Great movie, great cinematics, great &quot;no-plot&quot; and great fun... only if you literally swallow &quot;Wasabi&quot; down your throat just exactly as Jean Reno does by almost the end of the movie. Forget the good-ol' Reno-The-Cleaner (Nikita), do not expect any twisting, noir and all-french action-plot: just pretend your are reading a colorful comic-book with plenty of no-brainer action.<BR>Besson should get back to deeper, more elaborated plots, with possibly less color extravaganza and much more atmosphere and acting.
B000088E6D|2.0|I do admit that I was momentarily under the spell the media has crafted for Michael Buble. Touche, since \\"Fever\\" is a pretty likable cover. I have, however, been redeemed and possess a much clearer perspective of this phenomenon. It seems to me that more often than not that whenever someone of this persuasion (a young guy/girl who embraces pre-rock posturing) comes along the public gets all googly-eyed as if it's never been done before. Lest we forget the Harry Connick Jr. and Diana Krall hooplas? (Sorry Diana, had to include you after unleashing The Look Of Love on us.) Buble's debut effort is no different, nor is any better. Perhaps a better indication of the amount of talent and individuality this vocalist possesses would have been more evident had he not chosen the comfort and saftey of a sparkling David Foster production and a roster entirely of very standard standards. Not a single original number is here, nor is there any groove in this swing. I mean, anybody can look good in an Armani suit, but not just anyone can strut a no-name off-the-rack and turn heads in the process. During none of these tracks (do save \\"Fever\\") does Buble sound as inspired as the liner notes state he is by this music. On \\"Come Fly With Me\\", \\"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\\", and \\"That's All\\" he sounds downright insipid in his overtly precious readings. \\"Kissing A Fool\\" is a pointless color-by-numbers cover since George Michael offered the definitive version from the start; and the one man hip enough to cover \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" (Dwight Yoakam, indeed) has already done so, and quite properly. During this track Buble eninciates \\"rock-n-roll\\" as if Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver might have. So sure, Michael Buble may be getting al types of accolades now, but I beg to differ that he'd get any notice at all had he put out better, original work with a much earthier and revealing backing. That may have been his biggest mistake as far as his longevity is concerned. We'll see, and perhaps I'llgive him another chance when his next effort comes along...but only perhaps. Until then, however, I will take the Texas music fan's advice and keep playing Mr. Williams Swing While You're Winning. It is original, packed with wit and personality, and offers more enthusiasm for pre-rock posing without the posing than anything sung by Michael Buble or indicated in his notes--everything this debut needed but neglected.
0399226907|5.0|The Hungry Caterpillar Board Book is a wonderful story read for children in early grades. The content and illustrations hold attention and interest!

B000021XS0|5.0|No band, past or present, has been able to push hard rock to the levels of emotional intensity, technical brilliance, ingenious craft, intellectual complexity, and pure rockin'ness (if that's a word) that Dream Theater has been able to achieve. Each member of the band is a virtuoso - John Petrucci's fleet-fingered guitar solos can only be rivaled (if they can be at all) by Steve Vai's, Jordan Rudess burns his keyboard in ways I've never heard before, Mike Portnoy's drumming shifts effortlessly between time signatures that non-music theory majors might never have heard of, John Myung pulls off even the most devilish riffs on bass, and James LaBrie's voice soars and growls through a myriad of moods and styles. <br />This album is their masterpiece, a 77-minute ride that takes you to every place in the musical universe that hard rock ever can and will. Despite drawing on a complex storyline involving standard concepts like love and betrayal and moving on through reincarnation and hypnotherapy, the music manages to maintain a flow that, for the most part, makes perfect sense. Highlights include...the whole thing, really, but if you really want to hear the band at work, listen to the thrashy Beyond This Life, the stylistic diversity of Home, and the mind-boggling The Dance of Eternity. The album's masterpiece, however, is the gospel-style The Spirit Carries On, in which John Petrucci squeezes more emotional power out of an electric guitar than his very best hard rock peers could ever hope to achieve, followed by a magnificent and magnificently soulful gospel finale. <br />After owning this CD for 2 years and God only knows how many listenings, I still find something new each time and am thrilled by every minute of it. Recommended above every hard rock album that has ever come out or ever will.

6304458304|4.0|Just the right amount of humor, mostly Clint poking fun at his age, and action.  Great acting by Malkovich, and the chemistry is right on.  This is a movie I've really enjoyed and look forward to watching again and again.  However, don't be fooled by the \\"Deluxe Widescreen Presentation\\" title.  There are zero special features besides the French language option and the Spanish or Korean subtitles.  I'd hate to see the non-deluxe widescreen presentation...does it have no sound or something?  Get the \\"Special\\" edition if you want any features besides the movie.
0385495315|5.0|If there was more than five stars available this book would get them!  This book starts off with basic substitution and caesar shift ciphers and works its way up to PGP and even has a section on quantum cryptography.  Perfect for beginners or experts in the field of cryptography, this book is an absolute gold mine!  It's worth the price alone for all the historical facts you get from it also.
B00005JLXC|5.0|This movie was simply excellent.  Powerhouse performances from the entire cast are in store for anybody seeing this film for the first time.  I loved the \\"radar\\" special effects, which were beautifully done, and the dark plot of the movie made for an engaging watch.  Does anybody remember Colin Farrell as the \\"bad boy\\" on the BBC series \\"Ballykissangel\\"?  I couldn't believe it was the same person.  He's gone from taking care of sheep and riding horses in the Irish countryside to being a psychotic killer.  Is that Celine Dion's husband playing Elektra's father?  Oh, and don't miss Joe Pantoliano's turn as Ben Urich.
B000001FW9|3.0|I enjoyed this album quite a bit back in the '70s, especially the marvelous opening cut, &quot;Pentagruel's Nativity,&quot; but I will say now that despite its ambitions it is far from GG's best album.  The album veers between fairly straight-up 20th century dissonance a la Schoenberg and &quot;heavy&quot; blues rock cliches, rather than achieving the integrated synthesis of those two directions that they perfected in later albums.  Both styles are done in a rather plodding fashion, partly due to the rather unimaginative drumming of Martin Smith.  The musical originality that was already evident was compromised by their reliance on pseudo-orchestral progrock conventions such as the Mellotron, an instrument that they eschewed later when they found their identity as a sort of chamber music ensemble--a much more artistically valid idea of what to do with a classically trained rock band, if you ask me.  <BR>GG exhibited much musical growth on the next album, &quot;Three Friends,&quot; and really bloomed when on &quot;Octopus&quot; they discovered their dream drummer, John Weathers.  As Kerry Minnear once (more or less) said, &quot;He showed us that we could really rock instead of just playing twiddly bits.&quot;   As it is, &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot; sounds quite dated and is not nearly as enjoyable or musically revelatory as their later albums.
0792833260|5.0|Rain Man (Raymond) is a movie that is both entertaining and serious at the same time. As many of the other reviews here reveal, the movie is about Charles Babbit, who happens to discover the existence of a brother after his father's death, and Raymond, who is charles's autistic brother inheriting a fortune of $3 Million from his D-A-D. Charles, though initially unsentimental & motivated by money due to his wretched financial condition, makes a connection with his brother as they go along a cross-country drive and finally realizes that the love & care for his brother outweigh his devotion to money.<BR>It is a wonderfully executed movie with star-studded performances by both Hoffman and Cruise, that makes you laugh at times and feel a lump in your throat at other times. This one definitely is a quality movie worth relishing.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Countless times during the 25 years I've been alive, I've heard someone older than me sigh nostalgically and comment, \\"they just don't make 'em like they used to\\" with regards to contemporary cinema.  And I have to agree in terms of objective fact, but not in spirit.  No, they don't make movies like they used to, and as far as I'm concerned, that's to the good- I much prefer movies made from 1965 on, for the most part.  However, there are certain films, such as Rear Window, that you recognize could never be made in this era where special effects, short attention spans, and cheap thrills, dominate the suspense/horror genre, and you have to sigh nostalgically, even if, like me, you weren't alive during the period of cinema for which you are yearning.  Fortunately, you can pop in the excellent DVD release of this classic Hitchock film anytime you like and be taken back to a time where, indeed, they still made movies like they used to.<br />I don't see how you could not like this film.  As far as the acting goes, James Stewart is great as the crusty photographer with a broken leg and nothing to do but spy on his neighbors.  Meanwhile, the female lead, Grace Kelley, has the best role in the film, and she assumes it brilliantly.  Grace plays the woman of every man's dreams: heart-breakingly beautiful, kind, smart, and, as we find out in the film's climax, tough as nails.<br />That said, the real star of this film is Hitchock, who once again advances the art of filmmaking with his unique sense of macabre and technical expertise.  The story here is mainly existential rather than suspenseful.  The act of violence around which the film is centered is the most chilling example of the darkness of modern/postmodern existence, but each apartment into which James Stewart looks provides both James and the viewer with some very dark insight into the pain, the banality, and the frustration and isolation, that has become ingrained into life as we know it.  Now, how many suspense filmscan you name that are philosophically profound in addition to dramatic?<br />Finally, the DVD version is sweet.  I don't care much for extras, but the documentary is interesting.  Meanwhile, the sound and picture of the film itself won't give Terminator 2 a run for its money, but are both fantastic in DVD adaptation, especially given the period during which the film was made.<br />In sum, see Rear Window many, many times.  That goes for those you who already have seen it many times, as well as for those of you have never watched it.  Maybe they'll never make another Rear Window, but hey, you couldn't pop the film into your DVD player and lounge on your sofa cuddled with your loved one, pet, or bottle of beer, back in 1954, now, could you?

B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is and will always be one of my favorites. What I've found with CD is that I can listen the WHOLE way through without having to skip every other track. Also, as several other people have pointed out, there is no cursing!  Its nice to see a band express themselves without having to diss their momma or say the &quot;f&quot; word in every other sentence. <BR>Now this is hard for me to admit but I used to be a pop-head but after hearing &quot;Krawling&quot; on my local rock station (I live in South Florida so of course there is only one rock station and about fifty rap stations but that's a different story) and I feel in the love the group and immediately bought there album. The songs on this CD are powerful and anyone, I don't care who, can relate to at least one of them.  For me songs like &quot;Papercut&quot;, &quot;In The End&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot;, and &quot;Krawling&quot; have things that I feel I can relate to. Now I know music is all a matter of opinion and my opinion is that Linkin Park is at the top of there game.
B00001IVOR|5.0|I'm sorry, but i have to give props to the Wu-Tang clan for keeping the crew together for a long time and they got skillz. There's only one word to describe this album...Genius.  RZA laces every track with outrageous beats that'll keep ya' headz ringin.  This album has been out for almost 4 years and i started to spin it in my cd player again, and I don't think i'll change it for a while.  But besides that, GET THE ALBUM!  All the tracks are hott and the emcee's lyrically inclined level is indescribable and like no other.  Even if you don't like hip-hop, buy the album.  Trust me, you'll like it.
630204135X|5.0|\\"Persona\\" is the equivalent of cinematic poetry, and like many poems, it relies on striking visual imagery and symbolism to convey its meaning (or meaninglessness) rather than the conventional, linear narative of most films. While hauntingly beautiful, \\"Persona\\" is clearly open to interpretation, as many great poems are. The film is a frustrating, paradoxical enigma, but leaves the viewer breathless with its dazzling images and thought provoking \\"silences\\".<br />The paradox at the heart of the film involves the together yet separate place in which these two women find themselves. How can two people, two personalities, two entities be so merged yet so apart? <br />On a universal level, one could venture that the two women represent the ever-present duality in both man and nature; forces that are inter-related, yet so separate from each other: good vs. evil, the belief in God vs. the meaninglessness of existence (or as Aristotle might have phrased it: creation in time vs. the eternity of the universe) or love vs hate (among the many dueling dualities in the universe). The reason that these two women can never really merge is that the universal battling of conflicting forces could never allow it. Confliciting forces will always be separate, as hard as they try to connect or compromise.<br />On a personal level, the two women represent the vast abyss that separates one person from the other. As hard as we try to understand each other, the human psyche is a nearly inpenatrable puzzle that defies trite pschological categories. Because life is basically a stage, we are forced to play roles that are set up by other's expectations, fears and desires that don't necessarily reflect our true selves. The camera is always on, as the film implies, and we are are rarely free to be ouselves,if we are even able to discern who we are underneath the many masks that we wear. We are like \\"marionettes\\" with others pulling the strings of our personalities for us. For Bergmann, it seems, all relationships (husband/wife, parent/child, etc.) are doomed to failure. No matter how close we are able to get to each other, we will always be separate, with false and misleading notions (that we have created ouselves) of who the other person is.<br />From the above discussion, it is clear that the film is enormously complex. (I have not even begun to touch on all the elements of the film- that would take volumes.) Almost any other interpretation of the film would be equally valid. That is the daunting challenge and huge joy of this film. The meaning of beautifully symbolic poetry is often hard to penetrate. The effort, however, is worth it, so that we may learn about ourselves, about our relationship to others, and about our relationship to the universal forces.

B000056VJ7|5.0|Well i agree with the previous review except for the part about &quot;sitting&quot; and listening to this album.  I cant imagine myself sitting to this.  The music is so powerful and pumped up you have to get up, and become a rock star for about an hour!  It kicks off with the 10 minute Bat out of Hall which in my opnion is the ultimate rock song of all time.  Other highlights are You took the Words right OUt of My Mouth, Heaven Can Wait, the 13 minute duet, Paradise By the Dashboard Light, and his biggest hit from the Bat out Of Hell 1, Two Out Of Three Aint Bad.  If you truly feel that you are rock n roll then u must have this album.  And if you dont think your rock no roll, you will be after you listen to this!
B000001ESP|5.0|&quot;Moving Pictures&quot; has some very dynamic rock &amp; roll.  On this album Rush is reaching new heights with their ability to play hard rock, flawlessly, and controlled.  Neal Peart is simply one of the best rock drummers ever.  He also writes lyrics with meaning.  Some are very thought provoking but all are intelligently written and give this group an edge over other groups who's lyrics are discardable.  Songs like &quot;Limelight&quot; are awesome the way they build up to a crescendo and leave you feeling electrically charged.  &quot;The camera eye&quot; lives up to it's nearly 11 minute duration and &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; is probably the song that most people are familiar with.  Personally, I don't like all the songs on this album but some of the songs are Rush's best and that's worthy of a &quot;5&quot; rating.

B00004YX39|4.0|\\"Gaucho\\" was the last Steely Dan album back when they were making one every 2 years or so.  I've always wished they hadn't stopped here.  Donald Fagen went on to do \\"The Nightfly\\" in 1982.  It definitely has a Steely Dan sound but it wasn't the same.  I bought this album in late 1980.  Some of the songs were infectious.  \\"Babylon Sisters\\", \\"Hey Nineteen\\", \\"Time Out of Mind\\", songs like these leave no mistake of what they're about.  \\"Third World Man\\", the last song, is my favorite.  The first few times I heard this album are memorable.  It was great to hear more Steely Dan.  It had been 3 years since \\"Aja\\".  I knew I could buy a Steely Dan album unheard and not be disappointed.  During that time period it was great to hear something current that really sounded good.  Nowadays the best music seems to be in the past, especially rock and roll, which most of this album really isn't.  It's Steely Dan and it sounds good and that's what really matters.

B00003CXTG|5.0|I belive this movie is inspirational if you are ever in a romance slump. IT is very well developed even though it may not portray the true facts of the real pearl harbor. I find this movie to be very though provoking.
0060090367|5.0|I dare you to try to put this book down once you've started reading it.  From the first page, this book is hilarious, touching and heartbreaking all at the same time.  There are some surprising twists and turns, and the cast of characters is simply wonderful.  Marian Keyes has an amazing knack for creating realistic but interesting characters like Claire and her eccentric family, without making the book too over-the-top.  I literally laughed out loud most of the way through this book.  I love how Keyes manages to describe simply awful situations with humor and Claire's self-deprecating charm.  When I finished this book, I went out immediately and bought all 4 of her other books. For me, finding a new author is like getting presents on Christmas morning, and this was a great present!
0887306101|4.0|....<br />I had read Schwager Technical books on trading in the past. And although I liked them, I found them to be quite tedious. With his Market Wizards series I was thoroughly impressed. You read the real life accounts of the top traders in the world and all you can say to yourself is I can do it too.<br />In no way does Schwager's voice interfere with the wisdom and message that these top traders try to get across. This is one of the most inspirational financial books of the decade, solely because it doesn't try to inspire, it simply gives the average trader a glimpse of what others call the impossible, beating the market, and the hope that you may be in the next edition.
B000068TPN|5.0|We Were Soldiers does the best job of showing the horrors of war since Saving Private Ryan. WWS goes even further to show the brutality on the omefront (Yes,the military actually did notify familes by hiring cab drivers to deliver letters early in the war.) There are some tough scenes to sit through, particularly a napalm indicident, but it is definitely necessary to sit through this movie at least once. Mel Gibson turns in his finest performance since Braveheart. Such emotion...you can jus feel it, thanks to the raw realism of this well-crafted film.<br />The song &quot;Sgt. Mackenzie&quot; plays over two particularly harrowing scenes. It's an Irish war song, circa WW I, and I guarntee it will haunt you. WWS is worth seeing just to hear it.
B000088E6D|5.0|I can't recall what motivated me to order this CD, but am I glad I did. What an exceptional performer. I would describe the voice as possessing Bobby Darin's register channeled through Vic Damone's flawless pipes. He's so good I even enjoyed listening to songs I didn't particularly like. What especially impresses me is the flawless intonation from bottom to top. There are a lot of good singers out there who get weak and breathy in the lower register and strained in the upper region. Mr. Buble has one of those incredible instruments that is seamless from bottom or top. I am also blown away by his mastery of the material. On some CD's I've listened to recently, it seems the performer is still learning the in's and out's of the material. On this production you would swear this guy has been singing each song for several decades. I hope this CD is only the beginning of a lengthy chain of Michael Buble efforts.
B000089CPF|5.0|In a way the reviewer from Phoenix sums it all up, because if you believe in a world strictly divided into simple categories by intransigent boundaries, Calexico's music obviously isn't for you. Gringos shan't play with mariachi bands just as the white hillbilly kid from Tupelo, Miss., had no business stealing that negro groove (or even worse, their gospel music), Robert Zimmerman turned into Judas when he picked up the electric guitar and Sandy Koufax should have been driven off the mound because Jews don't play baseball. Boundaries are easy ways out for those who want to avoid the harder task of judging a work on its merit rather than by the classifiers it reinforces or breaches, and Calexico have always made it their business to negate the borderline that separates the Sonoran desert into a Calexican and a Mexicali part (which might explain in part why they're so much more popular in boundary-infested Europe than in their home country).<br />For those who appreciate Calexico for who they are, this album is amazing. For most of the album Calexico's high wire (sic) act between the populist and the intricate works out perfectly, and unlike some of the earlier albums Feast of Wire actually flows. Sunken Waltz and Quattro find a perfect way to match the groove of the music and the sobriety of the message, and Black Heart even manages to top this feat. Ironically, for the most part the mariachi elements are muted and make place for a more pronounced European influence: the string arrangements on Black Heart and Close Behind recall Goldfrapp, Yann Tiersen or Francoiz Breut's stunning Vingt a Trente Mille Jours rather than Mariachi Luz de Luna. (Again, the influences here are mutual and far from a crowd-pleasing career move.)<br />The instrumentals, long the Achilles heel on Calexico albums, work out perfectly and for the most part do what they are supposed to: link the vocal tracks and lead from one idea to the next. If there is one thing to complain though, it is thatthe album is frontloaded with vocal tracks (pandering to listening boothes?), and the album peters out on four quasi-instrumental tracks (especially the somnambulant No Doze) rather than end with a bang. But even with this minor blemish Feast of Wire is Calexico at the height of their skills and a strong contender for my album of the year.
B00006CXXU|5.0|What else is there to say about Xtina's \\"Stripped\\". I respect her. I respect her, her talent, and what she wears. She has truly stated that her debut album took her in a direction she hated. So she came back with a brand new sound and a brand new image. Lots of people see her new image as a easy way to sell lots of records & make lots of money. But Christina is right, people are afraid when a woman is comfortable and proud of her sexuality. Lots of young people Christina's age, famous or not, like to feel sexy. Is it a crime if Christina is enjoying herself mind, body, and soul? No. \\"Stripped\\" is an album that takes you where Christina's not only stripped on the outside, but she's stripped on the inside as well. Xtina dishes out fun, sexual dance tracks with more of a rock edge with \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" and \\"Dirrty\\" & on the song that is such an inspiration to keep going on when people try to hold you down, \\"Fighter\\". Christina also lets everything out about her life on \\"Stripped\\" including her complicated, abusive childhood on the beautiful track \\"I'm OK\\", which Christina penned in one take lying on the studio floor, in tears. This album, from start to finish, is the story of a young girl's life who survived a tragic childhood, competed in many talent shows, and finally found her place in the music business. After years of experience in the business, Christina did what few artists are able to do, she forgot everything people expected of her & laid herself on the line. There are no filler tracks on this album, each song having a true meaning whether it's walking away from something you think you need or cutting lose once in a while and getting dirty. This album defines the meaning of music, regardless of the pop stereotypes out there or the clothes on Xtina's back...or no clothes perhaps. Christina is just a beautiful, comfortable 22 year old woman who found the strength inside herself to be herself in front of the whole world & show what it really means to be a star. \\"Stripped\\" is a true, beautiful work of art that will always be remembered in my heart. Not only was it a time where Christina grew into herself, but the music on this record has helped me grow into myself.ar. \\"Stripped\\" is a true, beautiful work of art that will always be remembered in my heart.

B000002KIK|3.0|Seriously, Sabbath should have released this as an EP and it would have been a memorable end to the Ozzy era. The first four songs in the record may not be classic Sabbath, but I'll be damned if they are not awesome tunes. Any band at that time would have killed for such killer tracks as \\"Never Say Die\\", the thundering \\"Johnny Blade\\", the classic \\"Junior's Eyes\\" and the catchy and uplifting \\"Hard Road\\".<BR>If you are already into Sabbath, but have not listened this record, buy it only for the first 4 tracks. Keep that in mind and you will not be dissapointed. If you happen to love the rest of the CD, good for you!

0553573403|5.0|As I just stated in the title of this review, this is really one of the best Fantasy books of the last decade. And of all time. If I look at the past, I can only conclude that of the Fantasy series created before, Stephen R. Donaldson can compete with Martin, but compared with Donaldson, it is still Martin who prevails. Roger Zelazny with Amber and Jack Vance with Lyonesse and the Dying Earth also come close. Gormenghast is fine Fantasy Too. Tolkien is another story altogether and towers above these others. So, if you like Fantasy, this is surely a must read.<br />This first book and the follow-ups are realistic and full of depth. The characters are people with emotions and are placed in a newly created world that seems believable to me. The fantasy elements are used sparingly and in the right places and amounts. The whole arsenal of characters is used efficiently and does not cause confusion. I mean to say that all characters are all easily identifiable and readers probably won't mistake a character for another. Also, Martin uses the POV to great extent and this works great. As with real people I liked some and disliked others. If one of my favorites proved to be the POV in a certain chapter, My interest increased to high levels, but that is not to say that my interest in the story before and after such chapters diminishes. Certainly not. By no means!<br />These are fantastic books and other reviewers here have written large chunks of information already, so in order not to seem repititious I will soon end this review, but not before saying that all the five-star ratings are deserved.<br />Be warned! Martin does not shy away from death and violence and certain other elements many people in real life also tend to enjoy. Just read his short stories in Sandkings and A Song for Lya and you will quickly see what I mean.<br />Why these books miss prizes is beyond me, but it is clear that SF is higher on the priority list of voters. This is quality reading and deserve much more attention than the abominable books of Robert Jordan and other writers who write worse than you and me. I wrote this review in just a few minutes and it contains more useful information than such writers hope to get together in five pages. This is just my opinion, so ignore these ramblings if you do not agree with me, please.<br />These books are better than the so called mainstream literature that is now published and which is regarded with high esteem and crowds the shelves of bookshops. Well, not all of it is bad. If you haven't read this before, be sure to grab a copy of this book the next time you walk in such a shop. Do yourself a favor and Mr. Martin and the publishers. The last should be encouraged to publish such books.<br />Thank you Mr. Martin and happy reading to new readers.uch more attention than the abominable books of Robert Jordan and other writers who write worse than you and me.

0140186395|5.0|John Steinbeck's EAST OF EDEN was not well received by critics when it debuted in the 1950s, and although passing years have seen several re-evaluations it is still reguarded as secondary to the likes of GRAPES OF WRATH and OF MICE AND MEN.  It is true that the novel is flawed: it is a great big rambling thing crammed with obvious allegory, metaphor, and allusion, loosely structured to say the least.  And yet, in a odd sort of way, the very rambling, the looseness, the obviousness of the work gives it a tremendous grandeur that Steinbeck's more tightly structured work lacks.  The novel is as broad and vulgar and lively and provocative as the America it describes--and it is my favorite of Steinbeck's fiction.<br /><br />Any one who comes to the novel from the famous film adaptation starring James Dean will be surprized, for the roots of the novel run much deeper than the film, which is based only on perhaps a third of the novel.  This is not so much the story of brothers Aaron and Caleb Trask as it is the story of their parents, Adam Trask and Catherine Ames.  And in &#34;Cathy&#34; Ames, Steinbeck creates one of the darkest characters in all of 20th Century American Literature, a creature devoid of virtually anything recognizable as human emotion.  Fleeing from a past that includes murder, perversion, blackmail, and prostitution, Cathy assumes an angelic demeanor and lures the emotionally needy Adam Trask into love and marriage.  And when she no longer requires his protection... she destroys him.<br /><br />It is the stuff of classic melodrama, but in Steinbeck's hands it becomes more than melodrama; it becomes a novel that alternately reads at leisurely pace and then suddenly reads with the speed of a whirlwind, a tale that forces us to consider the nature of good and evil and the legacies we may leave for later generations.  For Adam and Cathy have two sons, and in the wake of their tragedy they will be left to fight out issues of moral choices, right and wrong, and love and hate in the sun-drenched Salinas Valley of California, the &#34;golden west&#34; of the &#34;new world&#34; as it rushes headlong into the modern age.  It is a novel epic in history, geography, and morality.<br /><br />Some will find the novel's constant reference to the story of Cain and Able more than a little obvious; others will find it too meandering, filled with too many side-issues and minor subplots.  Still others may be put off by the very slow way in which the novel gathers itself during its first hundred or so pages.  But once the pieces are in place, Steinbeck suddenly pulls the threads together to create one of the most remarkable tapestries in American letters--a tapestry that has no clearcut boundaries and that, for all its simplistic tone, offers little in the way of simplistic answers to the issues it raises.  Flawed, yes, but a great novel by a master of the form, so great that its flaws become intrinsic to its virtues.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerthe sun-drenched Salinas Valley of California, the &#34;golden west&#34; of the &#34;new world&#34; as it rushes headlong into the modern age.

B000000HSU|5.0|A really good punk record.  There are 16 hardcore songs and 4 reggea songs, and all the songs are great.  Dr. Know is probably the best punk guitar player ever (Warren Fitzgerald from the Vandals coming in a close 2nd).  You can't go wrong with 20 awesome songs.
B00007EBAG|4.0|I had no idea this album was a re-issue...I'm often in CD stores and never heard of a TTDA release lately except for the Greatest hits, so for me it came as a good surprise...a new TTDA album after years of silence and meditation.<BR>I have always liked TTDA's albums for their quality and the experimentations.His first album(introducing...)was a masterpiece of soul/funk and pop tunes where Neither fish nor flesh was very different, personnal not a all an easy-listening album, almost the nemesis of the first album.<BR>With Vibrator, TTDA combined the classic format with the weirdness to release something more melodic but still very profound-Vibrator would be my favourite TTDA's album for its diversity and wonderful melodies.<BR>With Wild Card! TTDA comes back to something easier to catch at first, the songs are more in a pop format coming closer to his very first album.<BR>Is it good or bad, I really can't tell, maybe TTDA went as far as he could or wanted to with the two previous albums.<BR>Wild card!is the work of a great artist-what a voice!-wiser, who seems to be at peace with his demons.Not that this album is a collection of sweet mellow funk/pop songs, but more a collection of controled emotions.If you were afraid that TTDA had nothing more to say, he proves you wrong.Not as innovative as some of his early works but extremely professional.<BR>A collection of very good songs even if a GREAT song is missing.
B00005JKZT|4.0|For J.R.R. Tolkien fans (of whom I am one): I found that I enjoyed Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" adaptation much more after I came to peace with the notion that it is not the book on a movie screen, but rather a story in its own right that captures the major themes of Tolkien's story. This helps one overcome the sense of betrayal at the plot and character changes and to savor the artistic merit of the films as a fabulous depiction of an imagined medieval world. This kept me on the edge of my seat, even though I knew the general storyline. Peter Jackson says in one of his commentaries that he wanted to visually re-create the beauty of Middle Earth as a compensation for any disappointment that Tolkien fans might feel with the plot changes, and in that sense I believe he has succeeded: we do feel we have visited Middle Earth (helped in no small part to the wild beauty of New Zealand). This rich depiction of the landscape of Middle Earth is what I enjoy most about the movies. Now when I go back to read the books, I have much more to feed my imagination, even when I imagine the scene differently.
B000002J1B|5.0|I just don't get how this album has been identified with &quot;jazz&quot; in any way, or even &quot;jazz fusion&quot;. This is no more jazz fusion than any of their other earlier albums, and it is no more &quot;jazz&quot; than The Yes Album is Country &amp; Western cross-ever.<br />This album is progressive ROCK at it's very best. This was Yes hitting on all cylinders; a brief moment in time when they seemed to be able to just &quot;hit the switch&quot; and it was happening, a finely tuned machine churning out clearly identifiable yet fresh and non-deriviative pure Yes, before the inevitable self-conscious and commercial ponderings began to complicate things. It seems to me that they were still just &quot;being Yes&quot;; they hadn't yet reached the identity crisis and second guessing that is almost a natural evolution for such bands.<br />This album throbs with a fiery energy that can be intensly engaging. And yes, I HAVE found myself humming various excerpts of this powerful music. The unrelenting emotional focus of this music is unforgettable.<br />I would like to have heard one more album with Moraz, but I was not disappointed with Going for the One, and always felt the band somehow retained some of his spirit and influence on that fine album. <br />After Going for the One, Yes and I pretty much parted ways until just recently. If you are partial to their material prior to and including Going for the One, and maybe enjoyed some of 90125 in spite of yourself, then I highly recommend Magnification.
B00000K0DK|3.0|This movie just isn't all that interesting and isn't very fun to watch.  If you want to see a gret old movie see High Noon or Night of the Hunter.
B000002J1I|3.0|I've read the opinion that this album was disliked because it wasn't Close to the Edge or Relayer.<br />Nonsense. The problem with this album was that it wasn't Going for the One! That album held huge promise for a continuation of Yes that wasn't strictly a re-hashing of the previous classics.<br />Then along came Tormato. I liked parts of it, wanted to like the whole thing. But something just wasn't clicking there.<br />It took over 20 years for Yes to finally get back on track with &quot;Magnification&quot;, and album which at last does justice both to their roots and to their progress.

0553382179|3.0|I like the idea behind &quot;Sink Reflections&quot; and the Flylady and I'm sure this book/method works for the absolute beginner but for those of us who already have a grasp on clutter, I didn't find much new inside.<br />I think the Flylady is more of a motivational writer than a &quot;how to&quot; wizard -- I didn't find much value -- some good common sense tips -- but nothing really earth shaking new.  Also, her little &quot;isms&quot; drove me nuts.  Too cutesy for my taste.  As for the e-mail list ...  good lord, how can anyone get organized when they receive 1000 e-mails w/in 24 hrs?  LOL  Final analysis of this book/method -- if you need a kick in the pants, get it.  If you're already established in routine but want more in-depth knowledge and original ideas -- skip it!  Beware though if you sign up for the e-mail list.  I'm not joking about the e-mail reminders.  They come all day long!
6305428298|5.0|Jane Horrocks demonstrates amazing Liza-in-her-prime-like talent here.  And Brenda Blethyn turns in her usual strong performance (although using the subtitle feature on the DVD might be a smart way to penetrate that often unintelligible accent).<br />However, this movie revolves around Michael Caine's spectacular performance as talent scout / manager Ray Say.  I just watched Caine's latest film, &quot;The Quiet American.&quot;  Put these three recent films together - Little Voice, Cider House Rules, The Quiet American and you've got three tremendous performances in *completely* different roles.  To me, the Ray Say role is far and away the best of the lot, yet it was the only one not nominated for an Academy Award.  At least the BAFTAs were paying attention.
B00006LLNU|3.0|I agree that Sigur Ros sounds like a raw version of many of the old 4AD bands (This Mortal Coil, Cocteau Twins, etc.).  I love those bands which is what attracted me to Sigur Ros.  Agaetis Byrjun was a great album, but I can't help but feel disappointed in ().  I think the high pitched whale sounds (or whatever they are) on Track 1 are rather silly.  Even though I love tracks 4, 6, and 8, I can't help but feel that a lot of the tracks are SO repetive.  Another comment:  the Cocteau Twins did an amazing job of singing in their own language, but Sigur Ros seems like they lack imagination in this department.  Sometimes I think I'm listening to an autistic Rain Man edition of some of the tracks.  I still appreciate what Sigur Ros is trying to do and will continue to support them with my hard earned cash.  I just hope that the future is brighter than this.
B000063CMK|5.0|I, just like most fans of this genre, spend lots of time seeking out music that will satisfy my jones for complicated, melodic, powerful, metalish, headbanging, symphonic tunage.   We all have different proclivities, but most of us seem to congregate around some center.   Yes and Genesis used to be the mainstream torch bearers, then Dream Theater took the torch.   But There are constantly new interpretations of the blend of all the musical characteristics I previously mentioned.<br />Pain of Salvation is an original from my point of view.   They pay homage to their influences, but their total composition and playing is completely them, much like another fave of mine, Symphony X.  They are neither the best, nor the worst.  They are, on their own, fantastic.   They are not bombastic ego maniacs, where individual technical prowess matters.   They are are a team, like SymphX and even swedish metallers like Soilwork.<br />This album, Remedy Lane, is massive, moody, draining, brilliant, fantastic, mature.  It, like all the more progressive collections of song that I have grown to love over the years, takes time to grow on you.   You don't get magnetized on the first listen, sometimes not even the 20th listen glues you to every song.   It can take months, maybe years, to attach yourself to the entire body of work.   <br />I have this one in heavy rotation right now.   I cannot seem to get bored, always finding something new.  I will not ever critisise someones subjective taste like many people who post reviews seem to do.   I hope these guys stay together and keep making music forever, growing and changing, so their real fans can keep discovering and listening

I save this book for last each night and EVERY single time he stops everything and listens to every word of the book and he INSTANTLY calms down. It is amazing! I don't know if it is because we read it every night without fail as the last book (consistency?) or if it is because of the book itself but he absolutely loves it even at his young age. I highly reccomend this book to read each evening.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Quoting a line from the first track off of this spectacular album, Beck has truly \\"let the golden age begin\\". Although I've been a fan of Beck since day one, his music and lyrics typically associated themselves well with a certain mood or background, but lacked any \\"meat\\" by which one could truely identify. Sure, the Mutations album was a mellow, somber collection of songs, and Midnight Vultures was a great uplifting (for the most part) album that both inspired and energised, but they both lacked cohestion, and thats just what has been delivered in Sea Change. Every song is focused and purposeful.  Theres no randomness in his words, theres no extranious sounds that dont add to the mood. It's raw and straightforward.<br />Perhaps I'm just a sad person at heart, but \\"Side of the Road\\" is perhaps the best track on the album, as its placement leaves the listener with a true sense of what Beck is going through, and offers no resolution.  This album chronicals the destruction of one person by another, and if it seems to slow down toward the end, it further drives home the point and feeling that Beck is trying to convey.  The next best track on the album, \\"Little One\\" is, in a word, creepy. Its images of death and themes that border on murder or suicide pair perfectly with the clashing tonality of the main guitar theme.<br />If your feeling great about life and have a stable, happy relationship, you will not truely \\"get\\" this album. For those others out there who are experiencing heart-ache and sorrow, this album provides us a friend who can express feelings we have all experienced. No matter what, it is an excellent exploration of the dark side, and Becks penchant for excellent song writing truely shines in Sea Change.
0790729652|5.0|Batman is one hell of a movie. It's got action, love, a villian, and a great freakin superhero. Michael Keaton is a great Batman (the best of them all) although he isn't as good as Vall Kilmer as Bruce Wayne he is definetly the best dark knight. Jack Nicholson steals the show as the Joker. He's not the kind of actor in this movie where they have a big flaw in their performance, he's perfect for the part. Tim Burton did a great job of making gothim city dark and evil. So from reading this review you know that batmans the best. If you like this movie you should definetly see the secong one (Batman Returns).
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series left me speechless.  I was in awe of the immensity of it.  The presentation is flawless, the story, superbe.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|I had high hopes for this film after seeing Pi. Jennifer Connolly, Marlon Wayans, and Ellen Burstyn did a more than decent job of acting. Not a very realistic story. Interesting, yes. Pleasant, no. Absurd may be the key word here. The score gets dull after a while. Just about the worst possible outcomes for all the characters. Highly recommended if you enjoy dread and hopelessness. If you buy or rent this, expect people including yourself to question your taste in film. Impatience with the plot is normal. Too long. Take it easy on the intoxicants during viewing.

While juggling her money problems, her friend and flat roommate, Suze, helps her through it.  Like most books Becky finds romance.  She soon learns that the key for being successful in life is to be honest with herself and the others around her.  I think anyone who enjoys a good laugh, shopping, and romance will like this book.  The author, Sophie Kinsella does a good job with this book.
B00008MHAK|5.0|Just what i needed for a rainy day, a NEW BEN HARPER ALBUM, BEST YET NO DOUBT.  He does the whole rainbow, the way only Ben Harper can, with great reggae like MY OWN TWO HANDS, great ballads in varieties of both folk and rock sounds like EVERYTHING and DIAMONDS INSIDE.  The album touches other genres as well, from 70's funk to African-style gospel alla Paul Simon, and he does them well.  While Ben Harper has always done different styles of music and done them fantastically, he feels less confined by the various genres here.  He somehow shines through the music much more consistently on this album and seems more in touch with each of the songs as he sings them.  I think unlike previous albums, where three or four tracks clearly stood out from the rest, here ther are legitimately 8-10 GREAT SONGS, depending on your tastes.  If you liked Ben Harper before, this is by far his most compelling studio effort.  The album breaks manages to maintain and even amplify what has made Ben Harper great till now, while breaking new ground and being original, and it miraculously does this over complete album, with only 2-3 tracks i'd classify as good-mediocre Ben Harper.  The rest will shine, you might not like all, but if there aren't at least 5 or 6 songs you LOVE on this album you are not a Ben Harper fan.  For people new to Ben Harper, this is the album to get.  While some MAY argue that LIVE FROM MARS is more intimate, or that there favourite song was on FIGHT FOR YOUR MIND, I would be surprised to hear anyone say this wasn't his best album yet easily.  So if you are interested in the BEST ARTIST OUT THERE, this is the albums to grab for sure.  And for everyone who does, and everyone who doesn't too, there is a TOUR coming, with another new light Jack Johnson, coming this year, so COME OUT, and support REAL ARTISTS and people who love their music.  Enjoy the Album everyone.
0440224764|5.0|Don't let the negative reviews discourage you from getting this book. Take it from a Grisham fan who's read all but a few of his offerings--this is Grisham at his very best.<br />The Partner is captivating from start to finish. It hooks you from page one and takes you on the wildest ride you'll ever experience from your living room chair. I won't go into a summary of plot points like all the other reviewers, but I will say this: the twists and turns will keep you guessing till the end, and when it's over you'll wish there was more!
0449227421|4.0|I haven't read a lot of Ken Follet (did read \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and the \\"Key to Rebecca\\") and enjoyed them both.  And I remember hearing that he is from Baltimore, so he can't be all bad!  I think his subject matter is a little too fantastic for my taste to read him faithfully.  But \\"The Third Twin\\" caught my eye in an airport bookstore and away I want.  I liked it a lot.  For one thing, it takes place at a VERY thinly disguised Johns Hopkins University, my alma mater.  And for another, it does some very nice messing with the mind of the reader - always a good sign.  I'm not well-schooled in genetics, especially the state of the art during the flashback eras in this book, but even if Follet did take some scientific license, it is still a very chilling story about the misuse of the fertility process and trait selection by greedy and corrupt individuals.
0380820846|4.0|This is my first Julia Quinn and my first romance novel.  If there are more like this one, I'll keep reading - and buying!  Romancing Mr. Bridgerton was witty and sweet and sexy while having a sound plot with a great deal of internal conflict that really brought the main characters to life.  I guess not having read the previous three books, I can't really compare it as other reviewers have done, but I can assure you that as a stand-along novel it is definitely enjoyable.<br />Penelope Featherington isn't beautiful, popular, titled, or rich.  She has been unsuccessfully on the Marriage Mart for over a decade and has been shelved as a spinster, really only going to balls to chaperon her younger sister.  Her dominating mother does not do much to bolster Penelope's self-esteem and a lifetime of maternal companionship awaits her.  Penelope has good company as a wallflower, though.  Her best friend, Eloise Bridgerton is also single.  Although, Eloise has actually turned down offers, while Penelope simply hasn't had any.  For almost as long as they have been friends (since their debuts), Penelope has been (secretly) in love with Eloise's older brother Colin.  Colin still isn't married and has recently returned from a long trip abroad.<br />He returns to find everything the same, exactly the same, which only feeds his wanderlust again.  He is discontent with his position in English society, but isn't strong enough to give it up, and so he leaves to find purpose in his idle existence.  Meanwhile, during his tenure in London, he has to put up with the social doings of the ton and the frequent mention of his name in the thrice-weekly gossip rag, \\"Lady Whistledown's Society Papers.\\"  The only thing making it bearable is, surprisingly, Penelope Featherington's sane, pleasant conversation, especially after she finds out his hidden ambition and encourages him in it.<br />A challenge is issued from the prickly, but honest Lady Danbury: a thousand pounds to the person who reveals the true Lady Whistledown.  She also takes an added interest in Penelope, recognizing her intelligence and drawing her out to receive some deserved attention.  Penelope slowly grows out of her forced shyness to blossom before Colin and the rest of the ton.<br />Of course, Colin is smitten, but he is plagued with doubts.  Penelope also does not just fall at her hero's feet, especially since he hasn't done anything particularly heroic.  I enjoyed their conversations, their individual personalities, and the cozy interiorness of their thoughts and struggles.  It created amazing empathy (with Penelope in particular) and wasn't overblown or dramatic or chaotic to create something out of nothing.  Quinn synthesizes a sensible, likeable heroine with an intelligent, honest partner within a relationship that will develop each partner in their chosen separate paths.  <br />I also loved the Bridgerton clan - they are such a *nice* family (admittedly, with superior verbal skills).  Having looked through other novels subsequently, I was surprised how unpleasant many people and events are.  Quinn has a light touch, without stepping into the realms of complete comedy or biting satire.  She handles the funny and the intense with a sure hand.  Romancing Mr. Bridgerton was a delight to read and I'm only sorry I finished it too quickly.  I can't wait to find out about the other Bridgertons!
B00005JLXC|5.0|\\"Daredevil\\" is a really fun movie, although it's a bit of a downer.  I certainly don't fault Ben Affleck - he does a good job.  But just about any young actor could have been inserted into his role.  Jennifer Garner is truly luscious as Electra - she's sexy as hell!  The film probably could have been done with one less villan - namely Bullseye.  Colin Farrell seemed to have a lot of fun with the character, though.  <BR>With the exception of an amusing little hormone-charged \\"duel\\" between Garner and Affleck's alter egos, all of the action takes place under cover of the dark.  I think the film benefits from that because it makes the CGI effects more acceptable to the eye.  (One of my major problems with Spiderman was the way that many of the CGI scenes in broad daylight looked pretty ludicrous)<BR>All in all, a great flick.  Too bad it's already been fed into the sequel machine - this one deserves to stand alone.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera proved herself to have the vocal chops to stand above the bubblegum crowd with her debut offering. Her sophomore effort took longer than the rest of the competition, but the wait was worth it. A more sophisticated collection of songs and messages than the average pop album, this is one you can sink your teeth into. It helps to be a fan of Aguilera, as this is a very personal project - I'd venture to say every song is about herself and all but two were co-written by her - however, the entire album is a pleasure to listen to without getting into her life story. The lyrics aren't wishy-washy, finding-myself dribble. You may not agree with her point of view, but this is one girl who knows she's a woman now. <br />Stripped's strengths are Aguilera's voice, great producing, decent lyrics, and a melding of various musical styles. You can tell she's studied music like a musician. The professionalism of the album is top-notch, which made the good tracks great and the mediocre tracks worth a listen. This is one of those CD's that you can listen to straight through without needing to skip. Thankfully, she has abandoned the rabid vocal gymnastics she indulged in earlier in her career.<br />The upbeat numbers are dance-worthy with elaborate production beats. They are energizing and are rocking with attitude. Most are about girl power and tight with a good focus. <BR>Strong tracks are: <BR>~Can't Hold Us Down (with Lil'Kim)<BR>~Fighter<BR>~Get Mine, Get Yours<BR>~Dirrty<BR>Good, but not very exceptional uptempo songs are:<BR>~Infatuation (Latin beat)<BR>~Makeover<br />With her impressive range and flexibility, Aguilera is one of the few young singers who excel at ballads as well without getting whiny or sentimental. These songs are more personal to the singer - dealing with her negative publicity, her underdog status, and her abusive father. In contrast to the dance songs, these are spare and simple with minimal producing and lovely instrumentals. <BR>The bestare:<BR>~Impossible (with Alicia Keys and somewhat blues-influenced)<BR>~Beautiful<BR>~I'm OK (confessional-style)<BR>~I Will Be (bonus track)<BR>Also very good:<BR>~Walk Away (Alicia Keys-esque)<BR>~The Voice Within (Mariah Carey-esque)<BR>~Keep on Singin' My Song (gospel-inflected)<br />The album is well-balanced between fast and slow songs, although quality-wise the latter are better. Sections are broken up by short spoken/sung interludes. This is a very long album with 21 tracks and clocking in at around 80 minutes. Impressively, almost all of the numbers are solid and distinctive, drawing on a variety of styles and sources, particularly R&B/hip-hop, jazz/soul/funk, and rock. The diversity of sound doesn't take away from the unity of Stripped, though. This is pop. It's all smoothed and blended and wrapped up as ear-candy with a few sweet surprises. Aguilera's integrity is maintained by the outstanding collaborative and production work, in which she also contributed heavily. All in all, a very respectable and consistent collection of fairly intelligent lyrics and mellifluous sounds. This won't revolutionize music or even the pop genre, but it has definitely established Christina Aguilera as an artist to watch.
0767853636|5.0|Now, I usually give a minimum of stars to poorly done movies, but some films are such so distinctively, exquistely, and deliciously that they are enjoyable enough to receive 5 stars. No one movie exemplifies this sort of film more than ANNIE. 50's B-movies? Too obviously bad. Parodies like The Rocky Horror Picture Show? Too aware of their cleverness. Only Annie blends all the elements of corniness to perfectly form a wonderfully, decadently bad movie.    From the opening scene with that small red-haired child lamenting in a self-indulgent display of musical depression to the closing scene involving small tap-dancing orphans, horses and fireworks, Annie is an amazing display of cheese.   The plot, as you must already know, centers around the delightfully irritating lil' orphan Annie (played to annoying perfection by that wee child never to do anything ever again, Aileen Quinn), a spunky little orphan with a will of iron and a heart of gold, who is, against the odds, chosen by the head of the household of the inconceivably wealthy Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney brilliantly mastered the art of \\"hrumph\\"ing) to stay at his New York mansion for one week-- and one week only. While at first \\"Daddy\\" Warbucks is insensitive to the young girl's plight, after a while she starts to warm his little greedy heart. The rest of the cast also plays this movie out splendidly, including the anal retentive, prudish Grace Farrell (played by Ann Reinking) who hyperventilates when Annie tells her she has never played tennis, and who has such intellectually stimulating lines as \\"Oh, fiddle faddle!\\", and the incompetent Molly (played by Toni Ann Gisondi) who has not the ability to sing, dance (she tries, oh, Lord, she tries), nor cry on cue.  And that's not all. No, no, that's not even the beginning. Watch and you'll see such historically accurate portraits such as the happy, bouncy, (and for some reason completely white) world of 1930s New York, and how a (possibly) mentally deficient red-headed munchkin inspired Franklin Delano Roosevelt to (gasp!) end the Great Depression. Where else will you see FDR, Eleanor, a frightening bald man and a perky little child singing a gratingly catchy inspirational tune around a portrait of George Washington? Nowhere else, that's where.    The music is catchy and easy to learn, so opportunities for parody are limitless. Plot holes and filming mistakes are abundant enough to be funny but not obvious enough to be pretentiously aware of their corniness.    I wish I could give it more stars. What else is there to say?
B000069AUI|5.0|WARNING: This review will be exceedingly biased, as I am a huge huge Coldplay fan. Read on if you don't care or are one too. . .<BR>Parachutes was a great album, but A Rush of Blood to the Head is even better. There isn't a bad song on the CD, and each one sounds different enough to keep things interesting while still holding on to that characteristic Coldplay wonderfulness. Unlike many modern bands, Coldplay is able to make the listener feel what they are feeling--be it love or extreme sadness. This is a great CD!!!!
B00000DFKF|5.0|Hail. This album is a great black metal one to own. I love black metal. Being NS, the NSBM propaganda behind all of Varg's work rteally enlightened me. HS!!<BR>    I am glad that Euronymous was slayed, because Varg would not be able to be here, putting fire in my heart.
B00004X0ER|3.0|The Hives are a good band. This CD is good, although many of the songs sound very repetitive. . . in fact, they all sound the same. Lead singer Pele Almquist's screaming voice ranges from amusing to enjoyable to just annoying. However, if you want to get into foreign bands (notably ones that have been americanized and aren't difficult to listen to) ot you like upbeat rock music and guys with big egos, this CD is for you.
B000000XB9|5.0|I bought this CD half-heartedly, just for old time's sake, apprehensive that the music might have gone stale. Wow! I couldn't have been more wrong! All the old magic is still there, but the sound captivated me more than most contemporary rock.  I now realize how unique this band was and that there has been nothing even vaguely similar on the radio for many years now. Their songs are powerful, melodic, soulful and captivating, perfectly delivered by that VOICE (John Fogerty) and the harmony vocals.  There's the wistful yearning of Have You Ever Seen The Rain, the spooky unease of Bad Moon Rising and the funky, bluesy rendition of I Heard It Through The Grapevine. There's also the catchy Down On The Corner with its swaying rhythm. Every one of these songs is a winner, but I must point out my other favourites like Proud Mary, Hey Tonight, Up Around The Bend and of course the divine Lodi, a lament of a disillusioned rocker on the road. This collection is as golden as golden can be - brilliant, emotionally captivating songs infused with gritty soul that have not merely survived the decades, but shine as brightly now as in the late 60s and early 70s. This is the most authentic rock 'n roll you'll ever get.
B00005JL96|5.0|I saw this on a plane first, and knew I had to have it. Perhaps my enthusiasm is because Stitch is remarkably like one of my dogs. But I really enjoyed this Disney movie more than any other recent ones except Toy Story. Not to give too much away, but it ends like a Jackie Chan movie with everyone the best of friends.
B00005UK1F|5.0|A masterpiece of art. People here have said everything I believe for this new achievement of Tchort.<BR>It is a masterpiece. Don't miss it.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|Not being particularly interested in mathematics or economic theory, I had no real desire to see A BEAUTIFUL MIND during its theatrical release, but found myself renting the DVD.  I was thoroughly engaged by Russell Crowe's performance!  It was masterful acting at its best - he was able to convey John Nash's brilliance and intellect as well as his descent into schizophrenia without making it into a caricature.  It was if he became John Nash and it's hard to believe he didn't win the Best Actor Oscar (politics at work, perhaps?)  Jennifer Connolly did a magnificent job as Nash's wife, Alicia, and certainly deserved her Oscar.  The chemistry between the two was palpable.  There were a number of subtle hints in the film that the people figuring in Nash's life weren't real - watch closely.  The movie's soundtrack works well with the film, and Charlotte Church's haunting voice only adds to the beauty of the score.    A couple of negatives - while I enjoyed the movie, it was at times overly sentimental and the problems faced by Nash seemed too easily overcome.  Also, while the credits do indicate the movie is based on Nash's life, there was much that was omitted...an illegitimate child, homosexual encounters, divorce.  To get a much better sense of John Nash's hard-fought struggle to triumph over his mental illness, read Sylvia Nasar's biography, A Beautiful Mind: The Life Of Mathematical Genius And Noble Laureate John Nash.
B00005J9ZB|5.0|Like almost every single note of Lucassen, this is a space opera that could be classified as exceptionally original. The keyboards are Arjen-signed. I can tell when a keyboard theme is written by Lucassen from the first note of it.<BR>8 brilliant voices help this amazing album as well as a bunch of musicians who play guitar and keys.<BR>From Vangelis keys to heavy prog guitar themes this album guarantees to never bore you. The story is fantastic.<BR>ahh.... Too much speaking for nothing: just buy this thing. It's one of a kind (like every other Ayreon album)
B00005JLRR|5.0|A simply excellent movie, and my favorite of the Star Trek series.  The film is a parable for our time.  Picard, who has spent a lifetime committed to the high ideals of the Federation, meets his clone - a clone who has spent his formative years in tortuous, merciless surroundings.  Wonderfully played by Tom Hardy, the clone despises the Federation and its ideals.  He also depises Picard for his weakness in following those ideals.   Picard's faith in himself is challanged, as he wonders if his principles and ideals would have survived the upbringing that his clone endured.<BR> ...    I found myself inspired by this film, and reminded of the reasons that Star Trek has become such eternal favorite.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Watching this film in theaters was like an excruciating visit to the dentist's office for a couple of fillings, an extraction, and a root canal.<br />My problems with the movie are threefold:<br />1) The film sets up a love triangle with an obvious resolution.  There's no reason to watch the rest of the movie when you know how the triangle will be resolved, yet over 2/3 of the movie is devoted to developing said triangle.  Watching over two hours of material that predictable is incredibly tedious to the point of painfulness.  Plus, the viewer has no reason to side with any party of the triangle, giving him or her no reason to care how it's resolved anyway.<br />2) Said love triangle aside, the film should have ended shortly after the climatic attack and battle of Pearl Harbor.  Everyone from the screenwriter to director to production staff apparently has no grasp of how story structures work, and placing such a powerful sequence only 2/3 of the way through the movie leaves the audience exhausted and apathetic through the remaining hour or so of the film.  There's just no way a true climax/resolution sequence can work with such a powerful sequence preceding it.<br />3) Historical facts were twisted in places, and extraneous side stories (such as Cuba Gooding Jr.'s factually-based role) simply take away from the rest of the film's action.  This movie could have been easily an hour shorter and much more powerful without all the irrelevant side stories that contributed nothing to the movie's plot.  Interesting subplots relevant to the film such as the possibility that the British had intelligence of the attack beforehand yet delayed handing it to Washington (or that FDR possibly intentionally ignored it) to draw the US into the war were left out entirely.  Again, the creators of the film thoroughly demonstrated their lack of plotting skills.<br />Those complaints aside, the DVD version allows the viewer to experience the powerful scenes (such as the Pearl Harbor attack and it's horrific aftermath) while winnowing out the fluff.  The viewer is free to skip past whatever portions of the film he or she wishes, plus experience all the special features included with the disc--so the DVD itself gets three stars from me rather than the one or two the movie itself deserves.and it's horrific aftermath) while winnowing out the fluff.

B00007G1ZM|5.0|This DVD is almost like a full-lengthed well done documentary on Joan Crawford, and they threw in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; as a bonus! The movie is classic, but what made me order this<br />immediatley is because of the documentary that I hadn't seen on TV. I am so glad to see Christina Crawford again. What a great story! She's my favorite celebrity because of her work, her down-to-earthness, and her humor. I'm glad she exposed what was going on in the Crawford house. I'd love to meet her some day. Great<br />DVD!

0440237688|1.0|The Giver was one of the most dark, sick, demented & depressing books I've ever read!<BR>It's amazing to me that the publishers would think this type of book would be suitable for \\"young readers.\\"   It was unnerving to read about the euthanasia of infants in the story and also the suicide of a little girl was just plain sick! <br />    I was very upset that this was required reading for my twelve-year-old son. I wish authors and publishers will come to realize that you don't have to have darkness and death in a book to provoke thought and emotion. Books with a light subject matter can be just as entertaining!  Overall if this book was written for an adult audience I wouldn't have a problem with it. However being that it was targeted towards youths, it was totally inappropriate!
6304211740|2.0|Well I am a fan of the book and I was really excited to see this so I went ahead and bought it. It got good reviews on rotten tomatoes and the cover just made it look good. Well, I was really disappointed. I tried so hard not to be critical, but it was BORING. They left all of the magic out of the movie. I could accept it not being very true to the book if only they had enhanced some of the scenes, but everything was just so bland. I should have rented it, and also the BBC version b/c that seems to be getting good ratings. The ending was in no way a good thing and I didn't feel any kind of true climax.
B00006AUIG|1.0|This movie was a waste of time. Not only was the dialogue especially saccharine and canned, the viewer waits, waits, and waits for something to happen which never does, until the very end when the plot attempts to neatly tie in some  demonic twist.<BR> It did have potential, and there are some scenes that might make one jump, but overall , it's weak. <BR> I found the acting to be poor as well. David Caruso, honestly, can anyone take him seriously? What a joke!<BR> If you are looking for a cerebral horror movie , this is not it. If you enjoyed \\"Darkness Falls\\" or recently graduated from eighth grade or listen to Nu metal, you'll relish this gem.<BR> Other people who possess intelligence, rent \\"With a friend like Harry\\", or something by Hitchcock.<BR>  Better yet forget this [bad] genre, and teach yourself a life lesson by watching Godfather II.
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca is one of my favorite movies.  This movie has everything: War, love, murder, gambling, drinking, sniveling French people, brave Norwegians, Nazis, and crooked cops.<br />Seriously, though...<br />This is one of the few movies that I could not possibly imagine in color.  The black and white adds a quality that no color could reproduce; it adds a starkness to the city of Casablanca, while making the characters stand out and become larger than life.  The direction is exellent, and the acting is marvelous, displaying virtually none of the annoyingly stilted style of the time.  The scene that really stands out is the one where the Germans are singing \\"Die Fatherland,\\" and Laszlo begins \\"La Marseilles.\\"  There are so many things working in this scene, but it captures the will of a people to resist tyranny, and also establishes the power of Laszlo to rally people to a cause, which really are the themes of the movie that work behind the love story.<br />Bogart is excellent, Bergman is radiant, and every other character is much more than a simple role player. They all have their motivations, and are not necessarily good or bad, but are all working toward something, be it passage out of Casablanca, the elimination of political rivals, or simply the acquisition of money.  They all work in concert to create a wonderful, fascinating story.<br />Simply one of the best movies ever.
0425180638|4.0|I was excited to listen to another book by Patricia Cornwell.   The book wasn't as complex and adventurous as previous works and this made it dissapointing for listeners.  The voices presented by the reader did not possess the range of other readers that listeners have come to expect.  Instead of being drawn into the book, often one looks ahead and hopes the next tape will somehow be better.  Here's hoping the next installment will be back to the norm.
0425170349|1.0|Clancy has officially hit rock bottom.  I couldn't believe how ridiculously one-sided this book was.  The good guys are perfect, and the bad guys have the emotional intelligence of a six-year-old.  I'm hoping that the American military doesn't have the same perception of our enemies as Clancy does.<br />What really bothers me is that even some of the most successful special forces operations in history--especially those which took place in such public settings as what is described in Rainbow Six--had a few things go wrong; hostages were killed and soldiers were injured.  Some even completely fell apart.  Clancy apparently either didn't do his homework on this or simply chose to disregard it.<br />I was really, REALLY disappointed in this book.  I am (or maybe was) a huge Clancy fan, and while the technical details were still there to satisfy a hard-core military techno-geek, the story was somewhat absurd, and the dialogue is bad, even for Clancy.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is the best Disney movie of all time!!!  You'd be crazy to pass up the Platinum Edition DVD.  The new song, \\"Human Again\\" blends into the original movie seamlessly.  Definitely worth your money!
B00005Y228|5.0|I have always loved Kylie Minogue, going all the way back to her first single I Should Be So Lucky, and I have never understood America's seeming rejection of her and her music for so long.  It was great to see her take America by storm with this incredible album.  Her music is unique to my ears, and Fever is an unqualified success filled with one great song after another.  I have a hard time describing this music; I think the thing I love most about Fever is the way it seems to draw from a lot of the music I loved in the 1980s and modify it into a definitely 21st century sound.  There are a lot of echoes and similar musical effects alongside synthesizer-type sounds, yet everything is subsumed into an untiring dance beat and energetic delivery.  As great and addictive a song as Can't Get You Out of My Head is, it barely scratches the surface of Kylie's distinctive musical stylings.  More than anything, it is the unflagging energy of these tracks that strikes me most forcibly.  This album hits the ground running with More, More, More, and it never slows down over the course of the following thirteen songs (which include two hidden tracks).<br />Kylie can get a little sentimental and tender on comparatively slower songs such as Fragile, as if she feels compelled to remind us of her unquestionable feminine charms, but \\"slow\\" in this case equates to anticipatory swaying in place as opposed to the wild frenetic dancing other tracks such as Fever seem to demand.  The chorus of Dancefloor sums the album up pretty well: \\"gonna lose it in the music; got my body, gonna use it.\\"  Who could resist her demand to \\"give it to me like I want it?\\"  Certainly not me.  Love at First Sight and Come Into My World are two of the better songs here and have received enough radio playing time to make them familiar to a lot of listeners, but my personal favorite would have to be In Your Eyes.<br />I wish I could describe this music better or explain why I like it so much.  A lot of time obviously went into these songs, and Kylie definitely sounds as if she is having a lot of fun performing each and every one of them.  I think her natural, true self really comes through in this music, producing fourteen tracks of pure Kylie magic.  This is one highly contagious Fever I am very happy to have caught.viously went into these songs, and Kylie definitely sounds as if she is having a lot of fun performing each and every one of them.

6300247376|4.0|Bronson's back!  This time his role is similar to the one he had in  Chato's Land;  A guy pursued by an angry mob wanting him dead, dead, Dead!  Naturally, because he's Bronson, they don't have the easiest time trying to get him.  These guys should have never shot his newfound dog friend, coz after that, all hell breaks loose.  The plot is nothing new, it's been done many times before(usually with more style), but this one is exceptional because of the cast.  Aside from Chuck, you have tough guy Lee Marvin, Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers who's always a joy), would-be Luke Skywalker-Andrew Davis, the \\"dude\\" talking cop from Death Wish 3, and the scary \\"Buffalo Woman.\\"  And to answer some of your questions, Peter Hunt(the director) was the editor of practically every James Bond film, and the director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  He passed away recently.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is a very difficult movie to characterise and assign to one or even two genres, which is also part of its appeal and fascination. It opens with the title character (Jake Gyllenhall) waking in his pyjamas, with his bike lying next to him, on a highway overlooking his hometown of Middlesex, set in an idyllic tree covered valley. Straightening up he looks out toward the rising sun on the horizon and with a knowing smile he re-mounts his bicycle and makes his way back home to the tune of Echo and The Bunnymens The Killing Moon in what is an excellent opening sequence. Right from these first few frames it was obvious that I was about to witness something very original and it had me hooked.<br />Donnie Darko is inspired (I would guess) by the weird combination of Philip K Dick, Wes Anderson, JD Salinger and the classic James Stewart movie Harvey. It announces the arrival of two great new talents in Writer/Director Richard Kelly and the young actor Jake Gyllenhall, in what is a hugely original, ingenious and entertaining movie. Set in 1988, around Halloween time, this movie has the conventional leafy-suburbia-plus-high-school setting, which alludes to the horror genre of Carrie and Halloween but it is no horror movie.  It also has specific elements that suggest that its a psychodrama about a young man with schizophrenia but this is not A Beautiful Mind. It also ponders the possibility of time travel but this is not science fiction. Stranger still, Donnie Darko is unusual in that (unlike most retro 1980s pictures such as The Wedding Singer) it actually has a very cool soundtrack drawn from the period of my youth, which includes contributions from the likes of Echo and The Bunnymen, Tears For Fears and Joy Division.<br />So, what is Donnie Darko about?  Well, without giving up too much of the plot, Donnie is continuously visited by a 6 foot tall rabbit named Frank, which unlike the Pooka in the classic Harvey is both visible to the audience and strangely satanic. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days six hours and forty two minutes but not to worry as everything is going to be all right. Guided by Frank he narrowly misses being killed when an engine from a 747 crashes through his house whilst he is lying sleeping on a local golf course and the plot thickens when it becomes apparent that the aviation authority has no record of any aircraft losing an engine. Donnie is of course undergoing therapy with a local shrink and hypnotherapist played by Katherine Ross (The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid) and the suggestion is of course that Donnie is hallucinating, for as his sister says he hasnt been taking his pills. One of Donnies recurring visions suggests that he can see the future before it happens and so he becomes obsessed with the possibility of time travel and a book written by a retired teacher, who is now a scary old recluse, The Philosophy of Time Travel. There are also many other sub-plots including Donnie being inspired by his English teacher (Drew Barrymore) and Graham Greenes short story The Destructors into some playful vandalism. In addition to this Donnies subversive thoughts and actions begin to undermine the stability of the local community that is strangely gripped by a slimy fundamentalist guru played by Patrick Swayze.<br />Much of this movie is darkly comic and there are some great scenes including a conversation between Donnie and his therapist, where she asks him what he thinks about at school. Like most teenage boys he inevitably replies having s*x before proceeding to unbutton his trousers about to m*sturbate. There is also a scene where at a PTA meeting Donnies mother challenges the local bigot by asking \\"Do you even know who Graham Greene is?\\" she confidently and proudly replies \\"Oh please! I think we've all seen Bonanza\\".<br />Personally I loved this movie but whether or not you enjoy this movie probably depends upon how far left of centre you like your movies. If you are not a fan of independent cinema or movies by the likes of Wes Anderson and David Lynch then you probably wont like this. However there is much to recommend in Donnie Darko, not least the cast, which includes, Noah Wyle (ER), Mary McDonnell (Dances With Wolves), Maggie Gyllenhaal (Confessions of A Dangerous Mind) and the previously mentioned Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Katherine Ross. Jake Gyllenhaals exquisite comic timing and laidback personality endows Donnie's existence with a dreamlike quality at odds with his teen angst and the suburban paranoia of his surroundings. Meanwhile writer/director Richard Kelly creates a wonderful sense of tension and keeps you guessing throughout the movie that even after the final titles have rolled you are still left to mull over what you have just witnessed.<br />Whilst critics may argue that Donnie Darko fails as a psychological study and/or horror movie, you cant help but feel they are missing the point, as it deliberately avoids easy classification to a specific genre and instead concentrates on being intelligent, ingenious and highly original.  Closing appropriately to a cover version of the old Tears For Fears song Mad World and the lyrics the dreams on which Im dying are the best Ive ever had, neatly ties up the previous two hours and what was for me a very satisfactory cinematic experience. Destined for cult status this undoubtedly deserves five stars!e probably depends upon how far left of centre you like your movies.

B00005RHGK|5.0|This was one of the best new HORROR (not slasher) movies that I have ever seen!  And that is an understatement!  This director guy Victor is gonna be big!  I love everything about this movie!  The music!  The suspense! The creeper! And the ending in which the killer actually wins...pure brillance!  It is going to go down in history as a classic right next to Halloween, The texas chainsaw massacre, and The Exorcist.  I think that every TRUE horror fan should buy this!!!!!!  Buy a copy for your wife!  Buy a copy for your kids!  Buy a copy for your dog!  Just buy the best horror movie ever made!
B000002MU3|5.0|There doesn't seem to be a point in defending this record since it just seems like you like it or you don't (and for the don'ts, oh well... ignorant slobs), so I'll just explain why I love it.  It's one of the few changes in direction that worked.  It's neither a response to grunge (overtly), nor an attept to \\"be cool.\\"  It's exactly the record they wanted to make, a superb rocking album in the vein of 70's glam, with blistering guitar and coy lyrical play from Stipe.  Each of these songs are superbly crafted ruminations on paranoia, conspiracy, sex, and death.  Especially sex and death, which as everybody knows often go hand in hand.  \\"I Took Your Name\\" is the best example of this, as Stipe does a wonderfully goofy impression of Iggy Pop against Peter Buck's screechy guitar and Mill's almost-too-high-for-reality power harmonies and deep reverbrant bass.  Stipe's cross of Big Brother and drooling obsession is classic in lines like \\"I pushed the button and erased your master tape.\\"  Elsewhere Stipe muses on the wonder of love (\\"Strange Currencies\\"), the dark gulf of loss and death (\\"Let Me In\\"), and bitter jealousy (\\"Circus Envy\\").  With how naturally the band comes off here, they seem like they were always meant to be hard-rock stars. The power and rush of \\"Band and Blame\\" and \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\" prove this beyond a doubt, showing that the band knows how to create great MUSIC in general, not just specialized in one genre.  If anything this is one of the most true albums to the band's illustrious past in its consistency and excellent craftsmanship.  The epitome of what great rock and pop music can and should be, pure and simple.
B000063UR1|1.0|This is one of the most ridiculous sci-fi DVD's I have ever seen.  The dialog between the Valley Forge and the other ship is ridiculous.  Dern talking to the two driods is pathetic.  If I had to see one more close up of Dern's flared nostrils I was going to puke.  I definitely would not recommend this DVD to anyone.  It is very dated, boring, with terrible acting, directing and dialog.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This movie was exciting and the special effects captivating.  I thought both Tobey and William were excellent as Spiderman and Green Goblin respectively.  Kristen Dunst was ok but what really was captivating was what was going on in the battle of Good and Evil.  Don't let little kids see this movie, the Green Goblin even freaked me out at points.  The whole movie was excellent and they left a door open for a sequel which I eagerly look forward to.
B000088E6D|5.0|He gives me FEVER!<br />Wow! From the first note on this CD, I became a Michael Buble fan. It's a great CD from start to finish. <br />Michael Buble has that rare gift to be able to croon like Sinatra and rock like Elvis. His talent will only improve as the years go by.<br />I eagerly look forward to his next CD, which hopefully will be coming out soon. <br />In the meantime buy this one and enjoy!
0316666343|4.0|My daughter-in-law gave me her copy to read, and I had no preconceived ideas, since I had not yet heard of it. I could not put it down, and found it different from anything I have read for a long time. It was chilling in its matter-of-factness about her death, yet the voice was perfect for a young teen girl. I have been one, and raised three, and it rang true in every way. I would recommend it to any woman over 14 or so, and look forward to reading more by this author. My daughter-in-law is so cool! She turned me on to Harry Potter before she even had a child! We love sharing our strange literary tastes. Only Shakespeare and Twain get 5 stars...well, maybe Asimov.
0060987464|5.0|This book tells all the possible things you might want to know about Manson. It will tie up all the rumors and will tell you what is true and what itsn't. It will speak of all the troubles the band had and still has. It's a very exciting book. a must read for all manson fans.I repeat: A MUST READ! take it from a Manson fan. it is twisted and disturbing but exicting and funny. Enjoy all of it. keep an open mind, very open.
B00007G207|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, I've been a projectionist on and off for the last 20 years and it gets into your blood, I have not aspired to become what Toto did, but wish that I would have.<br />Now the new version:  The first 2 hours of extra tidbits are just padding that the movie may or may not have needed, interesting they were, but necessary?  I just felt that it dragged on and on, keeping me from getting to the scenes I've grown to love.  Then the last 30 minutes (give or take a few minutes)  the entire thing was just too dark and sad.  I could've lived without seeing the final torment of Toto and his two comments in anger toward his beloved friend Alfredo.  In the old version the bond was unbroken between Toto and Alfredo.  These two lines caused some cracks in the bond, I didn't like seeing or hearing it.  It was nice to find out what happened to Elena, but we've seen it now, let's take it back out of the film and forget about it.  This film is about Toto and Alfredo...and secondarily about Toto and Elena.  In the original version, Elena disappeared and we assumed her father forbade any contact and that was fine with me.  I can see how others may like having this bit of news from the past, but I just can't deal with it.  Great movie in its original incarnation the one that won the Oscar.
0553801511|5.0|I purchased both hardcover copies of the new Tawny Man series by Robin Hobb. I was thrilled with the first book and very pleased with the second one. The continuation of the main story does not disappoint. I will admit that I was brought close to tears near the end of this book, which I will not blame solely on the dental work and pain killers I was on. Hobb has the ability to make you really care about the characters she has created. The interaction between characters is so well done that any disharmony in them truly makes you sad. Hobb brings a total sense of realism to her characters. I highly recommend all of Hobb's books in the three trilogies.
B000088E6D|5.0|I was standing in my local record store and heard this voice over the sound system.  I spent 25 minutes wandering around the store just to keep on listening to this voice.  I finally went up to the counter to ask the person who was singing.  He handed me the CD.  It was the last one.  Apparently while it was playing they had sold all but one of the stock.  I took it back to my office and listened to it all afternoon.  I contacted several of my friends who went out and purchased the CD.  They feel the same way I do... what a great voice and what a great CD.  I can hardly wait for his next one to be released.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes the old standards.  This guy has the voice of a seasoned pro.  It's hard to believe he is only 25.
0316666343|4.0|I read this book never having heard of it, so I had no preconceived expectations going in.  In my opinion the book is very well-written and has been hard to get out of my mind since I finished it a week ago.  It was very unsettling to experience Susie's death with her.  To hear her describe the disposal of her own remains was quite chilling.  I felt that the author's depiction of how such a tragedy can tear a family apart was very realistic.  Statistics show that a broken marriage often follows the death of a child.  However, the most disturbing thing of all to me was the fact that this book followed Susie for eight years in heaven and never once mentioned God.  I also find it contrary to what one expects of heaven to feel the longings and sense of loss that she did.  None of us know what to expect of heaven, which I believe to be the author's point, but I rather hope for more happiness and sense of peace.  It's good to read a book that shakes you up a bit and makes you think.
6305537321|5.0|I love this film despite two major flaws. 1.) they toned down the fact that Holly Golightly is a call girl (probably to maintain Audrey Hepburn's sweet image) and 2.) the awful inclusion of Mickey Rooney as an Asian. Both blunders make me mad. However, they didn't hide the fact that George Peppard's character was a kept man by the icy Patricia Neal. Nonetheless, the film succeeds as one of the most romantic stories ever filmed. Hepburn is utterly charming and her performance would have had a more interesting shade had Holly's true means of support not been practically erased. But when we learn she's run away from a very sad family situation---we see a glimpse of the true Holly. It's also an interesting note that two people living off of others for different reasons should find each other and fall ROMANTICALLY in love. The theme \\"Moon River\\" pulls every drop of poignancy from the tear ducts as does the scene with the kitten in the rain. I'm as jaded as they come and that scene gets me every time. I always choke up. This is a great film but could have been greater if the more adult aspects of the story had just been played out. Still I recommend this for lovers of shamelessly romantic movies. You really can't go wrong with this charmer.
B000005JAX|4.0|First off, let me just say that DM has been my very favorite band since I can remember.  That said, allow me to further state that although all of their albums are striking in their own way, it cannot be accurately said that they are all equal.  Martin Gore, being the chief songwriter and musician in the group, simply has a gift.  A remarkable and wonderful gift for putting catchy, engaging, and at the same time, haunting melodies together.  Can anyone who has heard the song &quot;Breathe&quot; from the album &quot;Exciter&quot; deny this??  He has a knack for arranging songs that are altogether sad, inspiring, beautiful, and just plain fun.  On &quot;Counterfeit,&quot; Martin lets this talent shine.  I did give this CD only 4 stars because he didn't write the songs, which I'll admit I would have greatly preferred.  But, given the songs he chose to cover, it is a stand-out solo effort.  Intrigued at the idea of an all-covers album, I took it upon myself to find an original version of all the songs to compare.  Now I understand- nobody but the brilliant Martin Gore could have made them sound good!! The arrangements are slower than you typically hear on a DM album, but nonetheless gorgeous, and Martin's vocals are perfectly suited for it.  Definitely one of the most under-rated musicians and vocalists in the business, which is very sad, but you will not be disappointed in adding this CD to your collection.
0553801481|5.0|Robin Hobb has got to be one of the best writers of today's fantasy. Her plots are well thought out and  the characters are very well drawn out, to the point that you really come to love or hate them respectively. In this book, she picks up the tale of Fitzchavalry Farseer and many of the characters from her first Farseer Trilogy. Although each trilogy is complete unto itself, many threads from her first two series, Farseer and Liveship Traders are pulled together, making all three trilogies a must read. There are many twists and turns in the plot and the reader is never left bored. The reader may be left a little anxious over the outcome of a character but Hobb always resolves each situation effectively. This world she has created is of a grand scale told in many locales on the planet. Her timing is superb. I would highly recommend this series to any fantasy fan.
B00005NGZX|5.0|converge is definately an aqquired taste, my friend hated this CD for the longest time then i got him to listen to it after about 2 times he loved it. songs like concubine (which means deranged ...) and the broken vow are almost un explainable and while they can create the most insane hardcore around they show there that they are true musicians with songs such as hell to pay and the title track jane doe where they just play around with the melodies. while jane doe is a fairly long track not one second of it is wasted. this is definately an album that will live on well past most music.
B00000DQSV|5.0|When Notorious came out, I didn't know what to think. It was a such big departure from the New Romantic/New Wave/Bubblegum Pop I was such a big fan of in 1984/'85. The boys had gone and split up. Powerstation and Arcadia were formed and then Duran Duran in stunted form regrouped, and I expected at the very least that Notorious would follow in the really HUGE shoes of Arcadia's 'So Red The Rose', but with the exception of a couple of tracks ('Hold Me' and 'Winter Marches On'), it did not.<br />Notorious is a strange album. I used to think it was inconsistent when it was first released. Upon further listening and recent revisiting, I've found that it has what the best Duran Duran albums contain: Cohesiveness. I don't recommend it as a starting place for would be Duranies, but it's more solid than Seven and the Ragged Tiger even if I can't say that this is a must have, based on the relative weakness of its singles. It's a transitional album that is neither as good as the first two Duran Duran albums or the subsequent release, Big Thing, and yet I'm inclined to give it five stars. Maybe because I can't give it ****1/2.<br />Highlights of the album are the non-singles: 'American Science', 'A Matter of Feeling', 'Hold Me', 'So Misled', 'Winter Marches On', and 'Proposition'. These songs seem to cover somewhat familiar ground  soundwise, so the comfort level was never an issue with me. Together these songs could form their own wonderful EP. <br />The rest of the tracks could be released as a 12\\" dance club standards EP. That's not to insult them, though. Quite the contrary, actually, as the remixes of Notorious, Skin Trade, Vertigo (Do The Demolition) and 'Meet El Presidente' outclass and outshine their album counterparts. The best of them albumwise is 'Vertigo (Do the Demolition)'. It's quite catchy, and from the assortment of more dance oriented tunes on Notorious, Vertigo probably most closely resembles singles of earlier Duran times, somewhat in the ilk of Wild Boys.<br />So, Notorious is a solid transitional album, but if you're looking to get into Duran Duran and the Duran Duran sound, start at the beginning so you can more fully recognize and understand what they were trying to accomplish here.
B000002IOY|3.0|Overkill's 4th album, and final one with founding guitarist Bobby Guftason.  With this album Overkill continues to expand on it's experimentation in de- and re-construction of traditional song structure.  The album immediately surprises you by placing the solo of the opening song, \\"Time To Kill\\" and the very end instead of the bridge.<BR> <BR>Earlier albums showed the band clearly working out new ideas on the stand, but here, the band knows what it wants and how to get there.  Unfortunately, this leads to some stagnation from overly-complex arrangements.<BR> <BR>But don't count this album out just yet.  \\"Elimination\\" may very well be the single best single song in the entire Overkill canon.  \\"Evil Never Dies\\" is a thrilling roller coaster ride of tangled riffs, solos and stop/start tempo changes.  And \\"Skullcrusher\\" is a 10-minute dirge that succeeds against all odds despide it's near-stationary tempo.<BR> <BR>Not their best album - the uninitated should listen to Taking Over and Under The Influence first - but definately a strong album that is an integral part of the Overkill story.
B000066NW0|5.0|For those that have a Britney portrait of Avril, I must admit you are wrong.  Avril's CD &quot;Let Go&quot; is by far the best on the market right now and she isn't going double platinum by selling them with her looks.  After listening to the CD, I couldn't put it down.  Some of the best songs are those that haven't gotten recognition.  Songs including &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Nobodys Fool&quot; and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; have great vocals from a young girl with enormous talent.  So don't waste your money on the single that wins 8 Grammys and instead get a real CD in which every song deserves a Grammy.
B00006CYAD|5.0|This is possibly the best CD I own. My favorite tracks are \\"The Worst Day Ever\\", \\"God Must Hate Me\\", and \\"One Day\\". With guest apperances from Mark Hoppus and Joel Madden, it is a great CD! Check out [...] for more info!

B00005N5S2|5.0|The FULLY RESTORED version of \\"MacArthur\\" is here and it is NOW on DVD! Not as strong as \\"Patton\\", but still intriguing. The complete war campaign of MacArthur...starring Gregory Peck in the leading role. From his first campaign in the Phillipines to his final battle in Korea. Indeed...you shall return to this DVD & see this movie over & over again. Truly delightful.
B0000047GA|4.0|Tony Williams can be described as the ingenius man of superiority that has been kind enough to record such albums  of amazement. He is truly a pioneer of drumming becuase he was one on the first to start the jazz-rock evolution. &quot;Emergnecy&quot; is one of the jaw-dropping albums that is a necessity for any fan or collector. The recording has a rough touch to it, however, this brings out the raw essence of flavor. Another aspect of considerations is the fact that he is man of a four piece set. His speed, power, and exactness combine to make the drumming phenominal. At first, this album by be unappealing, but listen to it two-three times and really analyze everything about the ablumn and see how you like it.
B00007BHOE|5.0|Yeah! This DVD is a must have. Excellent sound that could almost shake the ground!!! It shows you all the stuff that happen during a Slipknot concert, (and believe me i've been there) #1 joey hitting it off on the drum Or Jim's #4 excellent fingering on the guitar.  Trama you'll never feel on a stereo. It's a must. ahem,..Ladies and Gentlemen, Slipknot Disaterpiece. Get it while it's still hot. My compliments to the the producer. Nicely done.

B000007MVD|5.0|This CD caught me by surprise when it was released; having the official Beatles catalogue on cassette at the time, i thought that i had heard it all...i was so wrong! The first thing is that the bulk of these recordings are good quality songs performed live for radio (nothing like those poor sounding Hamburg performances)...there are great songs to be found here, many that have never made it to the Beatles albums...a real hilight for me is \\"i'll be on my way\\" a Lennon & McCartney original...you'll also find an assortment of rock n' roll covers...songs like \\"carol\\" \\"johhny be goode\\" \\"lucille\\" \\"youn g Blood\\"...Harrison's guitar, raw and full of energy shines throughout this set...the Beatles really kick up some dust here.....the whole package is wonderful including the descriptive booklet...what took it so long to get these released baffles me...this set is a treasure trove not just for Beatle fans but it is a piece of rock n' roll history for all to enjoy of time when they was fab....
031286504X|5.0|I first read this book in the 1950s, as a child.  My dad, an avid SciFi reader, gave it to me. We both loved it.  All this time I've kept the original paperback on my shelf.  I grew up to be a professional writer myself, and just decided to re-read this for pleasure---and also to study his craft.<br />Wow!  He IS a master.  The story, the pacing, the premise, the character (Robert Neville has to carry the entire narrative himself---it ain't easy to write a novel with one character in every scene, who can't talk to anyone but himself) are truly impressive.  And the acid test: you can't stop reading it---even when you KNOW what happens.<br />I think it was T.S. Eliot (or maybe not?) who said, \\"The most heinous crime a writer can commit is to be boring.\\"  Knowing all the vocabulary, the plot point tricks, etc etc are useless unless you can compel readers to keep with your story.  This is a great achievement of Matheson's, and it's a sort of magic.<br />I didn't find it dated as some did---in fact it seemed eerily current, what with the terrorist/biological warfare threat back<br />.<br />Matheson, I'm in awe of your talent!  Thanks for a great classic vampire tale...one that ....will live forever!
B000007MVU|5.0|Very good CD. Worth every cent! If you want a little cup of sugar and rock n roll, try this! This is Ringo's first solo album. Please buy. It's worth it!
B000001IQH|5.0|This little gem is an absolute classic! Picture the scene - a cynical ageing punk rocker slides the disc into his Hi-fi and straight away he's totally blown away! From the first notes of 'Maxwell Murder' to the end of 'The way I feel' this release doesn't let up in its exuberence and outstanding quality. It really does have everything from top notch ska ('Timebomb'), in your face punk ('Ruby Soho') to Oi! street anthems (Avenues and Alleyways') - it also manages to take in Rockabilly and more laid back reggae. <BR>Overall a truly awesome release, I brought this 6 years ago and it's still a regular choice on my player - you haven't got a Cd collection if you haven't got this!
0385483821|3.0|Like many popular management books, Andy Grove's \\"Only the Paranoid Survive\\" is unlikely to knock your socks off with its insightful business advice.  Rather, the book is chock full of common sense, backed up with case studies from the world of successful -- and not so successful -- American businesses.  Although Grove wrote this book during the early days of the Internet bubble, he clearly did not get wrapped up in the all of the excitement of that era, much to his credit.  His thoughts are measured, sensible and coldly rational, as befits an industry titan and the ex-CEO of the most successful chip company on the planet.<br />If you haven't read this book, now is as good a time to do so as any.  Today's readers have the benefit of knowing how technology and business have evolved since \\"Only the Paranoid Survive\\" was published in 1996.  The seven years that have since elapsed reveal that Grove really knows what he's talking about.  His understanding of how the Internet would affect Intel underscores his management prescience.  And his skepticism regarding gee-whiz technological innovations like \\"Internet appliances\\" provides an interesting example of how Intel maintained its strategic focus, and emerged from the bubble as strong as ever.<br />\\"Only the Paranoid Survive\\" breaks no new ground in the business-management genre.  But the book is well written, well organized, and well worth the read for those who want a glimpse inside the mind of an incomparable American success story.
0393307050|5.0|I only got this book to read it before the movie came out later this year, but Patrick O'Brian's brilliant knowledge of late eighteenth century naval affairs had me hooked right away.  I find myself diving into the rest of the series and just dying to see how the movie stacks up to this book.  I hope that the rest of the series is as well-written as this first chapter was.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Movie: Many people these days for some reason, hate long movies. This movie is the emperor of long movies, head cheese, king of the house, ruler of the worl...uh anyways. Each of the ten parts, is treated still part of one big movie, but still has a personality. Its exciting, dramatic, funny, intresting, and most of all historical. It dosent have to add in some stupid comic-relief character, or some cheesy love story. Its characters are completely real. It follows \\"E\\" company airborn troops, from D-Day in france, to the end of the war in the Austrian alps.<BR>            Movie= 6 out of 5 stars    :)<BR>    DVD(s): There are 6 DVD's, one being a special feature disk. The 5 movie DVD's each have large amount of special features: A Field Guide, which give information on the characters, storyline, army ranks,and maps. The sixth disk has info on the movie, the real people(WeStand Together: The Men of Easy Company 80 mins) and hours and hours of other features. A extremely great buy. <BR>DVD: 5 out of 5 stars<BR>...
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones were to Punk what Birds is to instant custard. <br />Quite a high Accolade eh? With the passing away of Joey Ramone a few months ago came the end of the 25 year Ramones story. But while there is tones I could write about the ramones and the influence of them it is of no consiquence to this Opinion - an opinion on the 2 CD Anthology that came out last year. <br />THE GENERAL INFO <br />The Anthology has 32 songs on CD1 and 25 on CD 2. If you like rock/pop /newwave /rock n roll or punk you will like this. <BR>It covers the full Recording history of the Ramones, all the top hits and memorable tracks. <BR>What is good is how the Sleave notes give us the album and session info for each track - for example :- <BR>'Cretin Hop' from Rocket to Russia, Produced by Tony Bongiovi & T. Erdelyi with the Enginneer Ed Stasium. <BR>We also have a nice touch in the addition of miniatures of the Album covers within the CD Case too - so we can see what the cover to 'Pleasant Dreams' or 'Mondo Bizarro' looked like. <BR>There are some nice photos within the booklet for those who are interested in seeing the visual might of the scrawny denim dervishes (You weirdo's). <br />THE MUSIC <br />Of the two CD's Number one is the 100% Hit, whilst to me CD two is not as good by a long shot. If the Anthology was only CD 1 it would still be more than worth it. <BR>When you listen to this album you cant help but see echoes in the work by more recent bands. Here is an example - Listen to 'Pinhead' song 14. Now listen to er.. either 'We're not supposed' to or 'strange ones' (Long time no hear!) from Supergrass'es 'I Should Coco'. THe fade out from Pin head seems to be used as insperation. <br />Its Sheer Bliss. Of the first CD I would say only 4 tracks are not Classics. On the second Cd however I find it easy to be picky - 'Ther KKK took my baby away', 'We want the airwaves' and 'somebody put something in my drink' are my prefered tracks I feel the rest is a bit, well 80's US rock really. But You may like them as well. <br />TO CONCLUDE <br />Buy it, you will like it. Or get it from your local Libarary... <BR>Blitzkreig Bop, I wanna be your Boyfriend, 53rd and 3rd, Now I wanna Sniff Some Glue, Gimmie Gimmie shock treatment, I remember you, California Sun, Swallow my Pride, Pinhead, Here today, gone tomorrow, Surfin Bird, I Dont care, I wanna be sedated, Needles and pins, I want you around and Baby I love you, are as small a top track selection I can make. <br />How can you not like this if you have ears? Even if you dont have ears you want it for the song titles. <br />There is not a single mumbling psuedo-angst diatribe in the whole Anthology. <br />IT'S BLISS.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I am not going to waste your time telling you my personal opinion about the show except to say I like it a lot.  I just want to tell you some practical information.  When I first picked up season one I frowned...the box felt thin and cheap, nothing like the cool looking season sets for TNG.  But the box has grown on me, mainly because the discs are easy to remove and put back.  You don't get the standard compliment of 26 episodes, but they are mastered well enough and the extras are adequate.  One final tip--if you buy this in a store and it says it comes with a bonus 7th DVD, run your fingers along the back of the box to see if you can feel it or not under the thin paper wrapping.  Some sets have it, some don't.  Make sure yours does.  Emjoy!

B00005LW7R|5.0|Having seen Bryn Terfel sing Falstaff I was very interested in this recording of the opera.  His performance for this recording is superb, and is the chief reason for buying this set.  Claudio Abaddo and the Berlin Philharmonic are equally excellent and it is apparent from their performance that they have a lot of affection for the score.  However, having listened to this recording a few times, I think it helps to have seen a performance of Falstaff in order to better appreciate the comic situations and humor, particularly for a better appreciation of  Mr. Terfel's performance.  The booklet provides a glimpse into the makeup and costume that adds so much to the character.<br />The wives of Windsor, Adrianne Pieczonka (Alice Ford), Dorothea Roschmann (Nannetta), Larissa Diadkova (Mistress Quickly) and Stella Douffexis (Meg Page) are very well cast.  Their performances are full of character and are a highlight of the recording. Thomas Hampson's Ford seemed to me to be overshadowed by Bryn Terfel, and not a very good match with the role.  Mr. Hampson sings well but his character never catches fire.  Daniil Shtoda made a suitably ardent Fenton and Anthony Mee and Anatoli Kostcherga make a comic Bardolph and Pistol.<br />The recording is excellent with a good feel for the orchestra and singers. Altogether, this is a good recording but not one that can outshine those that came before it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I couldn't write this review in less than the 1,000 word maximum, so I had to cut it into two.<br />~~The Tracks~~ <br />~~Disc 2~~ <br />(reviewed first because it is infinitely better than Disc 1) <br />~Nothing Else Matters(Metallica)~ <br />Whoever told Metallica that they should create a ballad should have been shot at dawn...without the blindfold option. Nothing Else Matters is Metallica's first ballad, from the `Black' album, and whilst not being the worst song in the world is also not exactly their finest either. James Hetfield is NOT a `singer' in the traditional sense...Metallica are NOT a pop-rock band and never have been. Yes they may have mellowed since the early days, but not far enough to be able to carry a ballad as yet. Live, this track goes down well though, and the addition of strings from the Philadelphia orchestra here on this live collaboration add an even deeper dimension to it, but Hetfield's rasping vocals and insistence on snarling and spitting out the last syllable of each line mean that this track could never be considered `beautiful' in the sense you feel it tries to pervey. <br />~Until It Sleeps(Load)~ <br />This is a great track, proving that Metallica still have some of the old magic. An enormously catchy song, with superb lyrics and a killer riff in the chorus, makes you want to sing along and maybe even break out the old air guitar which has been hiding somewhere in the dark recesses of your teenage years since Master Of Puppets...Here the orchestra add some `fatness' to the track,, but are generally missable. Until it sleeps is a superb track which is already somewhat musically busy without enhancement and perhaps the recognition of this is the reason for their somewhat backseat role in the proceedings. <br />~For Whom The Bell Tolls(Ride The Lightning)~ <br />The only track here from Ride The Lightning. For Whom The Bell Tolls is superb and could not have been handled better in my opinion. The track is left open for orchestral accompaniment, and there is loads of it throughout. It sounds more like the San Fransisco Orchestra featuring Metallica rather than vice versa. The verses are left pretty much unadulterated, but the chorus and intro exhibit a huge amount of collaboration, guitars and string section playing `follow my leader' between chorus and verse, and the orchestra filling in the gaps left by a young Metallica on only their second album. As an album track this track was good, but felt somewhat musically empty in parts, there simply wasn't the fat, gutsy sound that Metallica produced on Master Of Puppets and continued from then onwards. Live, this is another crowd pleaser, but here it has added depth as well. It sounds superb! <br />-Human(Previously Unreleased)~ <br />\\"You've gotta breath man, breathe...coming up for...aieaieairrrr\\"...A previously unreleased track which is seriously good. Why have you been hiding this one!?! A pompous orchestral intro filled with creeping insidious malice leads into a crunching, head nodding riff before switching tempo as Hetfield snarls out the first line. This is a really slow, grinding track reminiscent of Harvester Of Sorrow from Master Of Puppets, Hetfield singing the verse before lowering his tone to deliver a deeper more menacing growl for the chorus. The orchestra has a prominent part in this track, offering strength and depth to the verse, which otherwise may have been rather shallow had they not been there. <br />~Wherever I May Roam(Metallica)~ <br />This track on this album is superb! Wherever I May Roam was one of my favourites from the `Black' album but here it just got better. Metallica's mystical, middle-eastern sounding percussionless intro is heavily enhanced by some mysterious extras from the San Fransisco Orchestra's string section, which is truly haunting and build to a crescendo before the Ulrich drums kick in leading to the `big' pompous intro, which is again heavily orchestrially enhanced. This section of the song alone is vastly better in this collaboration, the pompous intro is even more pompous and the sound `huge', dark and mysterious. <br />~Outlaw Torn(Load)~ <br />I didn't like the `Load' album very much, as it sounded a little too much like a band trying to cash in on the success of past glories. Where the Black album was a superb album, packed with excellent more `pop-py' tracks and had massive worldwide and genre crossing appeal, this smacked of trying too hard to follow in the same lines. Outlaw Torn was one of the better tracks from this album, but even so, was little on the dull side. Metallica are NOT a pop-rock band and the sooner they realise this and Hetfield stops trying to `sing' and gets back to growling and snarling, then the sooner we can have some more of the kind of music which made them the mega-stars they are now. Outlaw torn is very much a plodder, bass led verse, followed by power corded chorus and some relatively unimpressive guitar play. A huge instrumental section fills the middle of the track with guitar and orchestral accompaniment blending together well. <br />~Sad But True(Metallica)~ <br />This is one of the tracks which I feel simply doesn't work here. Sad But True, is one of Metallica's big, pompous tracks. Live, its time for a sing-song, the riff heavy and over-emphasised, Ulrich pounding the drums into submission, you - fist pumping, head banging, chanting along to the chorus. The accompaniment of the orchestra takes something away from the clean chugging riff, which makes his song the crowd favourite it is. They feel completely unecessary and superfluous and I found myself unconsciously blotting them out rather than enjoying their accompaniment. <br />~One(...And Justice For All)~ <br />This is one of my favourite Metallica tracks. An intense anti-war song, One is both one on the most beautiful pieces of music you will ever hear as well as being one of the most intense. This track has an absolutely stunning intro, a collaboration between the string section again and Metallica's own melodic guitars. I get chills evert time I hear it and this version is even better. <br />~Enter Sandman(Metallica)~ <br />Just when you thought this track couldn't get any better, it just has. Enter Sandman is probably the track that even non-Metallica fans associates with them. It received masses of airplay on MTV and was a worldwide smash on its single release, many stating that it is the best metal track ever commited to vinyl. <br />~Battery(Master Of Puppets)~ <br />A strange `plucked' string beginning leads into a full display of the capabilities of the San Fransisco Orchestra's prowess. A rather odd track to single out for this approach as the melodic classical intro, leads into one of Metallica's thrashiest numbers. Battery, from Master Of Puppets, is a real peice of fast, crunching, powerhouse thrash, but this isn't the best delivery I have heard. Hetfield seems to have lost some of the venom from his voice and can not deliver the track the way it was meant to sound anymore, which can be heard when Jason Newstead joins in the chorus snarling pure venom over Hetfield's strangely willowy vocals here.
B00005B36H|3.0|I really love Tool- they have a great sound and they are excellent musicians.  I read the online critiques of Lateralus and judging by the rave reviews, I figured it was worth investing in buying it online myself.  But really, I was not impressed.  The songs have little to distinguish themselves from one another, and the CD as a whole lacks the energy and direction that Tool can usually deliver.  If someone said &quot;I absoutely ADORE track 5, I would have to say &quot;which one is that?&quot; because really, they all sound pretty much alike to me.  <br />On the plus side, the CD moves very easily from one track to another, giving it a very unified and complete feel for playing from beginning to end, and you won't be forwarding past certain songs if you like the album as a whole.<br />Overall, great band, so-so CD.  3 stars.
B00007DWRZ|5.0|I ordered the DVD from somlivre.com and besides having all the great music, it offers an unobtrusive, intimate look at the environment in which the music was created - having watched the DVD, I can tell you that contrary to the previous reviewer's comments, Carlinhos Brown contributes a lot to what you hear on Tribalistas.
B000002G30|5.0|their best album ever!!!  this album combines black sabbath doom style riff-o-rama with hawkwind style psychadelic mind mending music to offer up, without a doubt, the most awesome album MM ever spewed forth.  despite the few reviewers who do not see the beauty of this album, i assure you, this is the goods delivered. <BR>     with hits like \\"negasonic teenage warhead\\" with the simple verse riff (one string strummed) and the flanger to give it flavor which leads us to the explosive awesome chorus that just makes me jump out of my skin.  we also have the instrumental \\"ego, the living planet\\" which is a bit repitive but still rocks.  \\"look to the orb for the warning\\" and \\"third alternative\\" are alos worth noting as exceptional pieces.  <BR>    this whole album i can listen to from start to finish & top to bottom.  rarely do i skip a track and when its over, frequently do i replay some of them.  if this is your first MM experience or you are looking to get into them, this is one good place to start but you may be too blown away to go to work tommorow.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I couldn't write this review in less than the 1,000 word maximum, so I had to cut it into two.<br />Somewhere back in the late 90s two of the world's most powerful forms of music were to collide live on stage in front of an audience of thousands. Metallica's uncompromising style of thrash metal was to meet with the San Fransisco Orchestra, in a 2 hour set which would feature some of Metallica's greatest tracks given a new lease of life in a monster of a jam session. S&M is the result of that meeting - and a damn fine album it is too. <br />~~The Tracks~~ <br />--------------------------------------------- <br />~~Disc 1~~ <br />~The Ectasy Of Gold~ <br />The album opens with Ennio Moriconne's classic orchestral piece from the Western `The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', accompanied by the San Fransisco Orchestra. Not a Metallica track obviously but somehow the perfect introdution to this album and Metallica concerts in general - as well as being a superb piece of music in itself. <br />~The Call Of The Ktulu(Ride The Lightning)~ <br />The call of the Ktulu is an excellent instrumental track from the Ride The Lightning album. This is the perfect start to an album which sees the seemless integration of two of the most powerful forms of music colliding in a cachophony of sound which manages to be both melodic and beautiful whilst losing none of the aggression and power which is the typical Metallica sound. The Call Of The Ktulu could never be described as the best Metallica track out there but here, on this album, in conjunction with the SF orchestra it is given a new dimension and goes up a couple of notches in terms of my favourite tracks. <br />~Master Of Puppets(Master Of Puppets)~ <br />The orchestra seem to stay firmly in the background on this track, perhas because there was little they could add to a track so fine, or because this track just doesn't lend itself to an orchestral backing. Either way, it sounds little different to that track already found on the Master Of Puppets album, with the orchestra adding little more than a wall of noise in the background. This is one of the few collaboratins which doesn't work on this album and its a shame that it was both included in the set and so early on in the play list - it put me off the first time I listened as I thought the rest of the album was going to be pretty hit and miss - thankfuly I was wrong. Its not awful, but its not that great either. <br />~Of Wolf And Man(Metallica)~ <br />WOW! Of Wolf and Man, was always a pretty powerful track. Coming off the `Black' album it investigates man's closeness to nature - or lupine nature anyway but always seemed to be missing a little something to me. Here it finds that something, with the San Fransisco Orchestra adding an 'Edgar Allen Poe' feel to the track, an insidious, creeping malice which makes the hackles rise - just as the song always intended. Awooooooohhhh!!!!!! <br />~The Thing That Should Not Be(Master Of Puppets)~ <br />And if you thought the last track was menacing then you find that you hadn't heard anything yet. The Thing That Should Not Be, is a dark, slimy, pitdwelling beast of a track. An underlying sense of brooding evil which slithered out of your speakers from the Master Of Puppets album is given new strength and power by the orchestral strings. A deep dark treacly sense of foreboding and dark brooding evil is created by the superb collaboration. One of the best tracks on S&M - absolutely superb. <br />~Fuel(Reload)~ <br />A high-octane track is given an extra injection of adrenaline in the collaboration seen here. Pacey strings, accompanies Metallica's own thrashy guitars and rasping vocals to throw Fuel on the fire <br />~The Memory Remains(ReLoad)~ <br />It strikes me when writing this review, just how weak the first CD in this double album actually is. The Memory Remains is yet another off of the ReLoad album and is again one of the weaker Metallica tracks. Perhaps its just me, but Metallica just didn't sound up to much on either Load or Reload and although the orchestral backing helps this track it is still quite weak. Its worth the listen just to feel the atmosphere created, but its not great. There are loads of tracks from the older albums which Metallica could have played instead of opting for the commercial success again and going with the newer ones - the least popular ones to push a few albums. <br />~No Leaf Clover(New Track)~ <br />Complex and Powerful, No Leaf Clover is great track and one of the better of the more recent offering. The orchestral backing adds new depth and a greater dimension of impending death seeking you out. <br />~Hero Of The Day(Load)~ <br />Hetfield 'singing' again? Yep, and again its not worth a light. Both Load and Reload were rather weak albums and its a real shame to see so many of the tracks from these on this album. Hero Of The Day, is quite frankly boring, completely un-Metallica-like and worthy only of the 'skip' button. The orchestral backing does a little to aid its case - but not enough. <br />~Devils Dance(Reload)~ <br />Just superb! Strangely 'funky' for a Metallica track, Devils Dance is easily one of the best tracks I have heard from them and its miles better on here. <br />~Bleeding Me(Load)~ <br />This is one of my least favourite Metallica tracks in the first place, and here it is little better. Bleeding Me, is another where Hetfield attempts 'singing' and sounds rather silly. Its a slow churner, and really difficult to say anothing positive about...but there's always the skip button. <br />--------------------------------------------- <br />~~Verdict~~ <br />S&M is a historic album, probably never to be repeated. The mixture of the two musical style is absolutely amazing, making you wonder why it has never been done before(although it probably has and I missed it). The live recording is good and you can feel the crowd anticipation and the energy of Metallica's live show throughout even though you are not there. I cannot recommend this highly enough to Metallica fans and non-fans alike. If you are not sure whether its going to be to your taste or not, then check out a few tracks from KaZaA first - you will be blown away!
6304602979|4.0|This was a good movie because of the fun cast. Most of the supporting actors played in only 1 or 2 scenes, but there were so many of them (Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Samuel L. Jackson) that the movie stayed fun and interesting. Christian Slater did well with the lead role, and I am surprised that he doesn't take on very many leads. This movie lived up to every one of a Tarantino fan's expectations, and aside from the extremely strong language, the dialogue was fun. Obviously this is not a kid movie (what Tarantino film is?) and it would probably make some viewers uncomfortable. The R rating is typical for any Tarantino movie, which is for pervasive very strong language, strong violence, drug use, and some muted sexual situations. I recommend it to college aged kids in a group setting. This was a fun movie.
0060537639|5.0|For some, Menzies' compelling theory is disturbing because it challenges the widely accepted &quot;fact&quot; that has existed for centuries. I have to agree with the other readers that some of his arguments are speculative at best; however, the main premise of his theory is the existence of maps that predated the discovery of America. Unless the cartographer(s) of the predated map(s) is a clairvoyant, it is difficult to dismiss the main premise of Menzies' theory.<br />I hope the critics, especially the academics, can provide a rational explanations to refute Menzies' facts and theory about the predated maps before &quot;nit-picking&quot; the less significant arguments in the book.<br />Is it not that a learning process requires an open mindset to new theories and discoveries?
B000071ZZI|2.0|this was one of those movies where i knew the ending well in advance.  from the previews, you can get the idea of the plot.  matt damon plays a man trying to discover who he is.  there are people out to kill him for something he did that we have yet to know.  <BR>     i knew this and yet the movie, i found, was slow because it took almost an hour to get any info about him.  i knew he was some spy or something and probably did some dirty deed or maybe refused to do something for someone.  <BR>    yet the movie saw fit to dwell on this for far too long.  i was bored, waiting for the movie to pickup, to explode in action and bring me to edge of my seat.  of course this never happened.  this was a below average movie in which i found no joy
B00005YW4H|4.0|I truly enjoy  listening to the creative sounds and lyrics.  Her version of &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; is simply spectacular.  I would have bought the cd for that song alone.  A treat for the listeners.
B00000JG41|3.0|i had their first album and believed mike patton to be a genius.  this music is like sick jazz.  there is no formula or style and usually this is good.  it is EVERY style of music from metal to jazz to rock to strangness all rolled into one.  each song is a trip of variety & deranged mental roller coaster.  i applaud their diversity but on this album i found the arrangements flat.  there is no sense to it all or method to the madness.  <BR>   this album had moments that i thought were cool but just as it turned good it turned again and lost me.  i found myself bored by this album.  it was unintersting. this is not an album you listen to once and say i love it.  you need to absorb it a couple of times to make sense of it all.  this is not an album you listen to once.  there usually is alot going on.  <BR>   try their first album.  this album is, at best, good and at worst unbearable.  mike patton, was jumping between this band and his other band, faith no more.  the stretch took away form each individual piece of work and this album is a good example of how quantity kills quality.  <br />milkboydanny@hotmail.com
B0000508U6|5.0|I first bought this cd last summer because my friends and i enjoyed listening to \\"Yellow\\" after a crazy night of partying...I never thought i'd be purchasing a cd that would soon become one of my all-time favs. From start to finish its a very complete cd with many strong attributes and high points especially for a debut album. THe sky is the limit for Coldplay...heres a track by track analysis<br />1.Don't Panic 5/5 - beautiful two and half minute long intro song<BR>2.Shiver 5/5 - Awesome, slightly faster song w/ great lyrics one of my favs on the cd<BR>3.Spies 3/5 - this song slows way down and shows the odder side of Coldplay<BR>4.Sparks 4/5 - slow soothing song...excellent<BR>5.Yellow 6/5 - the original breakout single and still the best on the cd...a true classic<BR>6.Trouble 6/5 - The second single and jsut as good as Yellow plus it has one of my fav music videos ever<BR>7.Parachutes 4/5 - short interlude..but still awesome...had the potential to be an amazing song but was cut short<br />8.High Speed 3/5 - decent song but u still couldnt come close to calling it filler<BR>9.We Never Change 5/5 - another excellent song<BR>10.Everything's Not Lost 5/5 - GREAT album closer<br />You may not agree but ive listened to Radiohead extensively and coldplay may be similar but they blow Radiohead away. \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush...\\" just did alot more for me then any of Radiohead's efforts.<br />Bottom line is...Go pick up this album
B00005JKES|5.0|I rushed to buy this four disc set as soon as I saw it online.  I was a huge fan of the show and after watching it recently, it has lost none of its magic.  This set plays beautifully in Dobly Digital, DTS, and Dolby Surround.  It has been completely remastered and looks gorgeous!  One conflict to dispel, though.  The original pilot episode was never included in any offering of the series.  It is a separate show althogether.  I don't know if this has to do with licensing or just an attempt to make more money.  I, in no way, feel cheated by this.  I did gladly purchase the pilot edisode on DVD, but I must submit that it is a foriegn release of lesser quality as if copied from a laser disc, but still plays in Dolby Digital.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who was a fan of the show in the 90's, but don't forget to order the pilot!

B000002H33|5.0|Altough Metallica seems to make popular music right now, Master of Puppets is probably one of the best heavy metal albums released in the 80s. Complex, yet catchy, it gives a great view of what Metallica was like in the 80s (and how good they were) All the riffs are pretty heavy(even scaring) Metallica sometimes plays sonic-fast, and sometimes becomes so slow. The albums start out with the powerful &quot;Battery&quot; and continues with the epic &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. Probably one of the heaviest songs ever &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; is a frightening song, and the biggest reasons are James Hetfield's deadly vocals and the way too overdriven guitars. &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot; starts slow and fastens to the end, closing with a rhythm guitar, bass and lead guitar solo. &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; is a hyper-fast song with a faboulous guitar solo. &quot;Leper Messiah&quot;  is a &quot;questioning the religion&quot; song with fantastic lyrics. &quot;Orion&quot; is the second Metallica instrumental, showing how successful they can be on instrumentals. The closing song &quot;Damage Inc.&quot; is another fast one, including the fastest solo I've ever heard until Steve Vai. In conclusion, there aren't any songs on this album which you will not like. They're all metal classics, making the album one of the best
B00005JM1D|5.0|My wife and I are in our 50s. We decided to splurge on this picture and see it. I had trepidations about it because of its younger appeal. HOWEVER this was a movie that we both truly enjoyed. It was funny from beginning to end. Todd Phillips is an up and coming director. This movie made us rent \\"Road trip\\" which we both thoroughly enjoyed. Don't miss this movie no matter how old you are!
B00005JKZT|5.0|Ok so there were some changes in this movie from the books. So what? I've read the series four times and I like what they've done in the movies. You can't be exactly to the storyline. Number one there is the budget and all that...And to all you Tolkien purists out there can you at least forget the changes they made and enjoy the movie? Some people say this is a boring movie. Well, you can't have action all the time can you? I think the special effects were very, very good and I think everyone should see this movie
1573229725|5.0|This book will appeal to many sorts of people, among them; history nerds, neo-victorians, mystery buffs and those interested in books with lesbian themes.<br />Waters manages to write in Victorian prose and dialect without being heavy-handed, which makes this book all the more fascinating. The characters are easy to sympathize with, and I guarantee you'll be wondering at their fate once you get about a third through the book.<br />If you're looking for a book with unbelievable twists and unique characters, this is definitely worth buying.
0790730960|3.0|&quot;Batman Returns&quot; is a very dark and stylized sequel, Tim Burton once again managed to reflect the true essence of Gotham City's dark knight. This time around, our superhero must battle against a classic nemesis: &quot;The Penguin&quot; (magnificently portrayed by an inspired Danny DeVito), but the bird man is not alone; along with the penguin, there is an evil (and sexy) villain: Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), and also there is a third villain, the evil businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken).      The plot sometimes is a little silly, but the special effects, the sets, the fight sequences, the costumes, the gadgets and the penguins army make &quot;Batman Returns&quot; a very entertaining film that looks great. Also, it's the last entry in the Batman series which featured Tim Burton and Michael Keaton. Of course, the next two sequels are pretty poor films without them.
B000088E6D|5.0|I really enjoy the CD his music is his own and is so upbeat it makes you want to dance.  Easy to listen to and good sound.
B0000029DD|5.0|I will admit that although I love the album I am obsessed with two songs. Two songs that express the beauty and emotion that is the blood of music. &quot;Mojo Pin&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. This album is worth the money, even for these two songs. &quot;Mojo Pin&quot; is the first display of his amazing capability to communicate through both the guitar and his voice. But &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is beyond words. Herman Hesse would compare this song to Goethe and Mozart as amonth the immortals as told in &quot;Steppenwolf&quot;. This music is magic. This music is great because of this. It shows the face of god. If that last sentence doesn't convince you, nothing will.
B00005176F|4.0|this is an excellent collection of blur's hit songs. although blur never got much airplay in the states besides song 2 (of course) and girls and boys. the reason behind the four instead of five stars is because they didnt include m.o.r., one of my very favorite of blur's singles. i do agree with the earlier reviewer that of course owning the albums is better, and the songs sound out of context, but they're still great. yea. buy it.

B0000029GA|5.0|.....by far da greatest album of any kind of all tyme rite here. nas is a legend an no1 can deny that. here in beantown his music is bumpin erewhere. on this CD every song is a classic and any hip hop head must cop it if they dont got it already. id say, altho a tough choice the best song is, the world is yours, then memory lane, then it aint hard to tell. even in the intro, in the backround he is spittin some ill phrases. honestly ive never heard an album half this good by anyone but nas, he is by far da illest MC of all tyme (sorry pac ur 2nd) and this album prooves it. this one is for all the people who think everyone in hip-hop is dumb and uninformed, he showcases his incredible vocabulary and rhyming skills. if hes out there, nas u should come to beantown man, ur a legend out here and peeps love u.<BR>1 love<BR>bean
B00005ATQ8|5.0|I've justed watched this VHS amid the glorious kitsch bathos of Brazilian carnival, during a sweltering hot evening, and had the impression of receiving a much needed cold shower. Simply brilliant in coldness, irony, aristocratic distancing, and very true to the XVIIIth. century spirit. Also there was the opportunity to see the 1970s beauty Marisa Berenson in the best role of her life as a giant cameo of frozen beauty that surpasses any of Hitchkock blondies. Loved it!
B000002B1M|5.0|nas had a tuff CD to make in this one obviously because he set da standard so high when he released da greatest album of all tyme, illmatic, this is still an unbeliveable CD + again, i think this is a must 4 any hip hop head. <BR>1love<BR>bean
B00006BTCA|4.0|I bought this album based upon the hype surrounding this release.  However, unlike the Strokes this band IS something special.<br />First, allow me to clear my throat:  These guys only bear a SLIGHT semblence to Joy Division in that their lead singer kind of drones on with a fuzzy distortion around his voice and the tunes have a bit of the New Order/Joy Division musicianship MINUS Peter Hook's hypnotic base lines.  Finally, Ian Curtis was a much more morose and troubled character whose life bled into his vocals and music.<br />All that aside, I think this album resembles the airy pop sounds of bands like My Bloody Valentine (albeit on a lighter tip), Catherine Wheel, (again on a lighter tip), and of course Joy Division for the orchestrations.  They even have a hint of Smashing Pumpkins in them in their arrangements.<br />These guys are very good and hearken back to a mix of the early 80's gothic rock and early 90's post grunge rock with the swirling guitars and melodies.  <br />I think this sound has always had a special staying power and its good to see it back in a new package.  Matador records has done it again!  Think of what you felt when the first Radiohead CD came out:  I was impressed but not overwhelmed.  <br />Now think how you felt after listening to &quot;The Bends.&quot;  <br />Thats how I feel about this band and I can't wait to see if this spawns record labels to sign other bands with this sound to capture what I predict will be the latest renissance in modern music.

B000002KDW|5.0|The Faces were never huge stars in the US. Their sole Top 40 single, \\"Stay With Me\\", was about as much press as they got. Here, the Faces are better known for what their members went on to become: Rod Stewart, after doing very well for himself as the man who found the rock in folk, sold out to the great pop treadmill and hasn't released a good album in almost thirty years; Ronnie Lane became one of the most well-respected folk balladeers in the history of music; Ian McLagan became one of the most sought-after session players (behind only the virtuoso Nicky Hopkins); Kenney Jones went on for a brief stint with The Who before their first breakup; and Ronnie Wood arguably fared best out of the five in terms of , landing Mick Taylor's former post with the Greatest Rock'n'roll band in the world, The Rolling Stones.<br />But despite what the five members of The Faces became, no one can deny the simple fact that while they were together, they formed one of the most powerful influences on the whole of what is now termed 'classic rock', and that this album, their third of four, was the band at the peak of their talents. Wood and Lane play like men possessed, and Stewart's voice has never sounded better before or after, whether it be in screaming primal rage at the failure of the protest movement in \\"Miss Judy's Farm\\" or in reducing the listener near to tears with \\"Love Lives Here\\".<br />The album kicks off with one of the great protest songs of the 70s, \\"Miss Judy's Farm\\". Wood's guitar mumbles and growls until McLagan's organ bursts in with a strange off-kilter riff, followed closely by Stewart's raspy bark augmented by a steady drum beat and a sizzling rhythmic bass line. The song yells angrily at the inability of the singer to resist the iron will of the mysterious 'Miss Judy', who brings in the National Guard to quell their offenses. The song becomes immortalized in the quiet final verse in which Stewart sings \\"Miss Judy, she was moody, but she always didn't get her ownway...\\" before the instrumentalists screech into a terrifying coda with Stewart roaring \\"Kick her when she's down!\\" It's an unequaled rock opener that gives the mosh pit antics of modern grunge a run for their money. The transition into \\"You're So Rude\\" couldn't be more marked - Ronnie Lane sings a hilarious rock-ballad-tale of seduction (\\"Try the sofa!\\" he sings innocently, before the suggestive solo break) dripping with straight-faced comic snaps. And again the record turns, swinging back to Stewart who exchanges his snarling roar for a brilliant Ronnie-Lane-penned plea entitled \\"Love Lives Here\\", a quiet, heartbreaking song that Stewart has yet to match in any post-\\"Atlantic Crossing\\" record. The reins are handed back to Lane for \\"Last Orders Please\\", another comic send up in which the eternally-straight faced Lane sings yet another barroom-stomping awkward love tale with the infamous opening lines \\"Well, well, hello! And how are you? Fancy seeing you here...\\"<br />Side Two (for you record enthusiasts) opens with the most famous song in the Faces catalogue: \\"Stay With Me\\". Wood's guitar smashes out one of the most memorable riffs in Rock history with Lane and Jones steadily plugging along behind. McLagan's instrumental breaks on the organ make the song, however, even more than Stewart's less-than-glamorous tale of Rock'n'roll excess in dealing with women. Stewart yells out \\"Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne, just don't be here in the morning when I wake up!\\", clearly expressing his opinions on the subject of his more adoring fans. The song degenerates into an electric jam in which McLagan and Wood face off, playing their hearts out. Both Stewart and Wood have covered the song live during their solo careers, and it's no surprise that Wood's versions are time and time again superior. \\"Debris\\" continues the trend of switching vocalists, with Ronnie Lane singing one of his own softer ballads, the same straight faced voice that lent the awkward humor to \\"You're So Rude\\" here lends a sense of such innocence that few can resist the feeling of absolute sadness at hearing such a happy voice singing about so broken a situation. It's the musical equivalent of the comforting dog at crisis situations - it doesn't understand, it's just trying to help. A good old-fashioned Chuck Berry romp is the answer to all ills, so it seems, and the Faces don't disappoint with their slide-laden version of \\"Memphis\\", Stewart giving another stellar performance. If you wonder why critics these days can't stop blasting this guy, it's because they've heard this album and know he can do better. Following it, the frustrated Stewart sneaks back into the album, with \\"Too Bad\\", a crazy story of a band crashing a high-class party, with Wood and McLagan again providing the barrelhouse backing. The album concludes with \\"That's All You Need\\", a showcase for just how incredible Ronnie Wood was at his peak (and has started to become again, following a terrible twenty-year slump punctuated by one or two incredible performances struggling in a sea of cocaine and booze). Not to be outdone, Stewart gives his all, roaring out the story of dissatisfaction with the dead-end life of the successful worker who believed that \\"an IQ was all you need\\" who suddenly smashes back into the singer's life with the realization that he's not happy. And as the song concludes, the band and a steel drum backs up Wood, softly singing of the music \\"that's all you need\\" as the album fades out.<br />The Faces have become widely recognized, along with The Jeff Beck Group, as one of the primary influences on the rock'n'roll most thought would die following the dissolution of The Beatles. But no album ever released by any band has had the ability to make a listener go from feeling like rioting to feeling like laughing to feeling like crying to feeling like dancing to feeling like singing within the space of just a few brief songs.<br />For that, \\"A Nod's As Good As A Wink... To A Blind Horse\\" stands as one of the greatest achievements in the history of twentieth century music. An absolute essential for anyone who thinks they might even be remotely interested in the concept of \\"rock music\\".
B00003CXA6|4.0|&quot;Gettysburg&quot; represents that rare occasion in the movies where the filmmakers are painstaking in their attempts to get all of their facts right and still make a watchable movie.  And though you can quibble about a few of the dtetails, they succeed quite well.  The movie is based on the hugely popular novel, &quot;The Killer Angles,&quot; which placed dialog in the mouths of the leaders who fought the battle and breathed life back into the legends.  The movies is quite faithful to the book, and places its emphasis on Maine Colonel Joshua Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) as well as Confedrate Generals Lee (Martin Sheen) and Longstreet (Tom Berriger).<br />The DVD version of the movie places the whole 254 minutes on one double-sided disk.  The film looks terrific and there are a number of extras, including a &quot;Making Of&quot; sequence and a documentary of the battle itself.  There are also battlefield maps to help the viewer and audio commentary by the filmakers.  If you add it all up, it makes for one great package for any devoted Civil War buff and even those less committed who merely want to understand their history better.
B00005V331|5.0|Venom's terrifying 1st release, the original death metal prototype, absolutely seared speakers and left listeners slack-jawed in the early 80's. Rarely had a band come along and played with such blatant disregard for amplification and melody. While not the greatest of musicians, as evidenced by Abbadon's barely passable drumming, this album set a new standard in brutality and mayhem. Mixing Satanic imagery and lyrics with bulldozer rhythms and bargain basement production, the album sounds primitive by today's standards, but listening to such innovative tracks such as \\"Sons of Satan\\", \\"Live Like An Angel, Die Like A Devil\\", and the still soul-feezing \\"Welcome To Hell\\", with it's Lord's Prayer chant that can STILL send shivers up your spine, you knew Venom had caught onto something. They introduced a new wave of metal practitioners, and a new term for the metal masses; Black Metal. Soon afterwards, bands such as Bathory, Celtic Frost and Possessed took the initiative that Venom started and soon made Black Metal a viable exponent of metal. Their influence was worldwide. After awhile, Venom's antics and attitude got a bit much, and their music suffered, never fully recovering after releasing the mediocre \\"Possessed\\" album. Their legacy is the the brutal \\"Black Metal\\" and this, their debut classic. In your hands, you hold a history lesson followed and preached by many a new generation of metal loyalists and bands, including Metallica, who OPENED for Venom on the infamous and now legendary 7 Dates Of Hell tour. An absolute must have if you even think about getting into death/black metal.
6300213668|4.0|Grease is one of the top grossing musicals of all time based on the longest running Broadway musical (before CATS) of the same name. This musical does a good job of capuring high school life in the late 50s early 60s. There are many top songs such as \\"Hopelessly devoted to you\\", \\"Greased lightning\\" and the title tune. The only draw back, as noted by many film critics, is that it shows the yielding to peer pressure is the only way to be popular. Other than that this is a good musical. There are many cameo appearances by Hollywood legends such as Eve Arden and Sid Ceasar. The rock group Sha Na Na played the band during the dance.
B000088E6P|1.0|I was quite excited when i bought the album due to my loving the song wagnsta. After hearing the other songs on the cd i went and sold it...It was that bad. His cd was a one hit wonder. Even his new song in da club [was bad]. So i say if you are going to buy this album because you like 50's two songs and think that there will be others just as good you are wrong . Dont waste your money.
0345440900|3.0|I  read this book over and over, before my baby was born and many times over the first few months I was dealing with my colicky newborn.  While the BW ( what we call her in our house)offers great general advice for taking care of babies you might as well chuck it aside of you are already in deep with sleep problems! I swear I followed all her advice!!  But, it just does not offer details.  Friends agree.   I finally ditched my well worn copy at 6 months and solved my babies terrible sleep problems quickly  with &quot;Healthy sleep,....&quot; . <BR>A good read full of general advice, but won't solve sleep problems. Move on.
B000066NW0|4.0|This cute girl can really rock and roll. The tracks really do electrify. This is no COMPLICATED artist. I doubt she'll ever be LOSING GRIP. I think SK8ER BOI is an awesome track. Avril LaVigne is the closest thing to heavy metal. This chick is really MOBILE when on stage. So continue to play that punky music,white girl or honkette!
B00005JKZT|4.0|I really enjoyed The Two Towers.  Not because it was a faithful movie adaptation of the book, but because I enjoyed it for what it was.  My expectations were not that I was going to view a movie version of the book.  I was going to see a movie that I hoped would be entertaining in its own right.  This movie did that for me.<BR>     I can understand the disappointment of those who desire to see a movie about a book that they love.  I enjoy getting caught up in a book and letting my imagination take over.  However, I don't expect everyone to envision the story in their mind the same way that I do.  That is why I have tried to watch the first and second installments of this trilogy without preconceived ideas of how the story should be handled.<BR>     I found this movie very entertaining.  I enjoy being able to go to a movie without being bombarded with a lot swearing and sexual situations.  For that I am thankful.  There was a fair amount of violence in this movie, but it would be hard to tell a story like this without the action.<BR>     A lot of the tension in those scenes has been relieved by making Gimli into sort of a comic character.  This is one of the changes from the book that I enjoyed.  I think it would have been too dark and intense without it.  I was a little disappointed that the movie changed character traits of some of the more noble characters of the book.  There are also some of other deviations from the book that I wish they would have handled differently.<BR>     I do not think that this movie was as good as the first one.  I thought the action scenes were more powerful in the first movie, and I also thought that the action scenes in the first movie touched me in a more deeper way.  However, I still enjoyed this movie very much.  It was very well done.
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck does an incredible job of using what was happening during the time period to influence his characters. His two characters George and Lennie were complete opposites but they fit together perfectly.  This book shows how even the hardest thing to do could be the best choice in life.  George is a more serious minded man who just wants to stay on the good side of his boss on whatever job he is doing.  Lennie always wants to hear about their future dream life and play with mice.  Lennie is big and he doesn't always realize that he can hurt or even kill things. George promised Aunt Clara (the lady who looked over Lennie) that when she died that she could count on him to look out for Lennie.  If you need a good book, that is not too long and has a great story and also a lot of good but not complicated symbolism, this is a great pick!
B000002C25|4.0|The instant Be Here Now hit the headphones of the critics it was written off. The hype surrounding Be Here Now was incredible, and therefore people expected 'Supersonic' and 'Wonderwall' repeated, and Oasis didn't give it to them. But Be Here Now is in fact a stunning mix of light Rock and majestic, soaring epics. 'D'You Know What I Mean?' kicks off the album with distroted chords and catchy rock riffs with depth in the lyrics that is often overlooked on first listen. The album reaches the depth only achieved previously with 'Wonderwall' and 'Cast No Shadow' with 'Stand By Me' and 'Don't Go Away', both of which show Liam's softer vocal skills. 'I Hope, I Think, I Know' and 'My Big Miuth' are both fast-paced, catchy little ditties and 'Fade In/Out' catches the listener with a sudden contrast to it's first few minutes with Slide Guitar and hard vocals. 'Magic Pie', though not one of Oasis' greatest tunes, which, unfotunately, does not highlight Noel's singing ability well, does have some beautiful touches in both the lyrics and guitar. Though 'Be Here Now' and the reprisal of 'All Around the World' are both rather weak (However I don't think the Reprisal was meant to be the greatest musical piece Noel's ever written) the end of the album is truly where it shines. 'It's Gettin' Better (Man! )' is a racous yet soaring seven minutes of musical glory with an incredible minute-long guitar riff at the five minute mark and some of Liam's greatest ever singing; he mixes his trademark sneering with some tone and note changes never before seen in him. Finally, 'All Around The World'; a 9-minute epic of a tune, indescribable to mere words and possibly my favourite ever Oasis song; the 'Champagne Supernova' of Be Here Now. If you like Oasis, in fact, if you like Alterntive music at all, you must get this album.
B000009QOC|5.0|If I could give it 100 stars I would-A classic album,a must have for all rock fans.Best of all Danzig Albums in my opinion.
B000002BBY|5.0|This is the best album Oasis have ever done. Every track is brilliant, 10/10 for each song on the album. 'Hello' opens the album perfectly, with the line 'It's good to be back' - very significant. 'Roll With It' continues the fast rock trend that we saw in 'Definitly Maybe', 'I think I've got a feeling I'm lost inside' repeated at the end is a highlight. 'Wonderwall' - there is nothing more to say, sheer brilliance. 'Don't Look Back In Anger', argubly better than the previous track, Noels voice suits it well and it remains as one of the finest Oasis tracks ever. 'Hey Now' is a flashback to the debut album, very rocky and lots of guitars. 'Some Might Say' is one of the best singles released by the band, deservidly getting to ~1 in the UK charts, this is a classic. The lyrics may not mean anything but when a song is this good, they don't need to. 'Cast No Shadow' is dedicated to Richard Ashcroft, he and Noel are the best songwriters of this generation. This is a beautiful tender ballad, just right in the middle of a full-on rock album. 'She's Electric' is a fun, happy affair. The 'Digsy's Diner' of the album, a very successful hit, everyone I know who has this album regards this as a standout track.<br />However, with nine previous brilliant tracks, the album reaches its peak right at the end with the final two, epic tracks. 'Morning Glory', the title track of this epic album, is a mass of guitars and heavy drums. This is pure brilliance. Again, meaningless lyrics but still a landmark song. One of the best of the 90's. And then we finish with THE best song of the 90's, brilliant lyrics, superb chords, amazing rhythm and a lead guitar solo to die for (check the live version out on 'Familiar To Millions', 'Champaigne Supernova' is the finest Oasis track, in my own view, to date. Brilliant. Long live Oasis.

B000006ZGF|5.0|The harmonies by the Gibb brothers on this album make my heart swell.  This is truly beautiful music.  How spectacular they are as both writers and singers certainly shows on this album.  I wore my tape (purchased in '97) out, and had to replace it with a CD. <br />This is a must have for any Bee Gee lover!
B00005QZWI|4.0|Beautiful music specially the hobbits and elves themes
0767020308|5.0|The period detail is terrific.  The actors are in great form.  And the story line is that of Jane Austin's.  If she could have made movies, she would have been proud to make this one.
B00005JLO2|4.0|Okay, I admit I bought this movie for my husband, who enjoys this genre.  But I did watch it and enjoy it with several reservations.<br />1. The characters are British.  Heath Ledger is Australian; Kate Hudson & Wes Bentley are American.  I admit to being fond of Wes Bentley since American Beauty but Kate Hudson was better suited to How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, in which she shone.  I can't see Heath Ledger's appeal at all.  But were there no young British actors to take the parts?  Colin Farrell, for example (and, yes, I know he's Welsh).<br />2. The brilliant battle scenes left me wondering why the British were in the Sudan at all.  There were so many unnecessary deaths to keep control over a desert land that the natives were fighting to win back.  Perhaps these desert wars were the precursors of the present day troubles in the Middle East.  And the British did not adapt well to desert fighting.  One battle scene, however, reminded me of a similar scene in the movie Willow, as buried fighters rose up to ambush the oncoming British.<br />3. This is the third movie I've seen recently in which I believe that the heroine chose the wrong man at the end.  Jack (Bentley) was true to his friend Harry and did not send him a feather.  He went to the Sudan, did his duty, was blinded, and, at the end, did not get Ethne, whom he loved dearly.  He was basically left with nothing but his honor. I call this the Prodigal Son's Brother effect, and I have always sympathized with the older brother, who deserved the fatted calf.  In Sweet Home Alabama and Just Married, the heroine also chooses the wrong man.  I found myself finishing this movie with the same bad taste in my mouth that I had with the two aforementioned movies.<br />However, it is a good two hours entertainment, well done with the costumes, settings, etc.  It deserves its four stars.

B00006F83Y|2.0|What a huge let down,I bought Songs For The Deaf because their last release Rated \\"R\\" was very good!And upon hearing the single\\"No One Knows\\"on tv got me thinking maybe this new album would be just as or if not better than their previous effort.But I was wrong!I have listened to the hole cd a few times just to give it a chance.But,I just can't seem to get into it at all.I found most of all the songs to be straight out boring!I only found 3\\"okay\\"songs that I found listenable here \\"No One Knows\\"(which is getting played to death already) and\\"The Sky Is Fallin'\\"and \\"Hangin'Tree\\" that's about it.The rest are just straight out boring filler!So don't listen to what Mtv says,their just hyping it up that's all it is,straight out hype nothing more...Just get their last less commercial release Rated \\"R\\" it is way much better than this boring cd...
B00005NTN5|5.0|Yes I own this video.  I thought it was incredibly suspensful the first time around.  But after the plot is fully revealed I don't feel watching it a second time just to see what happens is necessary or wise.  So why I have I watched it more than once?  Its all about the lesbian sex scene.  *Sigh* Hormones.  It's beautifully done and will turn on any girl loving girl or girl loving guy.  I mean after all it is the kinda movie that holds you by the seat of the pants to see what happens, and unless you have a memory that's not up to par, it's hard to watch over and over again just to see what happens.  The fact Jennifer Tilly is hot helps the movie.
B00003CXA6|4.0|I saw the movie 'Gettysburg' a few years back and thought it was very good but not great. I felt that there was something missing, that it really didn't have a beginning or a fitting ending. Of course, I know the beginning and the end result of the Civil War itself, but, still, I felt the movie was not quite complete. That is, until the release of the pre-quel to Gettysburg - 'Gods and Generals.' 'God's', although much more dramatic and not quite as action-packed as Gettysburg, is a fitting beginning to what will hopefully/eventually become a trilogy (although \\"Gods\\" needs to be much more balanced and much less biased against the North - plenty of great scenes left in the vault, so far unseen), with the third installment (Last Full Measure) due (?) sometime in the not too distant future.<br /><br />Gettysburg is historically correct - NOT politically correct -  which is so prominent in most of today's movies, music, tv shows, news reports, and everything else the media has control of. It shows this most horrific of all battles ever fought on U. S. soil to be so accurate (at least according to the history books I've read) that 'Gettysburg' could be used as a text book/documentary for American history classes. I feel the biggest reason for this is due to the fact that re-enactors have played such a prominent role in the making of both of these films, making sure that they're historically correct right down to the buttons on the uniforms worn by the fighting men (yes, yes, I KNOW about the facial hair, but those aren't re-enactors!). And the battle scenes are as realistic as can possibly be done. When you watch the men during Pickett's charge, and see the anguished look on the general's face during the aftermath, one gets the feeling of actually witnessing the carnage that took place.<br /><br />And the Little Round Top scene will get your heart beating just as it must have beat in the men who were there. Truly gripping.<br /><br />I have such a greater, clearer understanding of the Civil War due to both movies being so historically correct. The men on both sides who fought in this war are no longer just old pictures in a history book, or silly 1950's b-movie style characters, but real men who fought and died horrible deaths. I wish more historical epics would use re-enactors in the movie making process. They truly bring the past to life.<br /><br />Do I recommend Gettysburg? Most definitely! Before seeing Gods and Generals, I would have given it a rating of 4. Now, however, a 5 rating seems too low! And I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel to both movies to complete the trilogy!<br /><br />By the way, I know that there is an extended version 'director's cut' of Gettysburg out there, as I have seen it on TBS. Why is this not available on DVD?<br /><br />Also, I would absolutely love to see a movie giving the civilians of the town of Gettysburg's point of view. Many folks do not realize what they went through during (and for months after) the battle. Every bit as exciting as the battle itself!<br /><br />One more thing, if you get a chance, please do yourself a favor and<br /><br />(A) take a trip to Gettysburg to see for yourself the awesome  battlefields and still-intact town. And it's within an hour from Antietam and an hour and a half from Harper's Ferry. It would be a vacation steeped in history.<br /><br />(B) Go to a Civil re-enactment and see for yourself the excitement of battle.<br /><br />Thank you to all involved for bringing our history to life accurately!Civil War due to both movies being so historically correct.

0786915749|5.0|These characters, often collectively referred to as the Companions will be with me for the rest of my life. Also read the Legends trilogy and Dragons of summer flame if you like this trilogy. I like Tolkien but i think this trilogy is better. Instead of wading thrugh page after page, chapter after chapter of Tolkien trying to describe a tree in a new way, these characters jump off the page coming to life. There are many great characters in this unique world. Sturm's nobility and Raistlin's duality make them strong contenders for best character but Tanis is my favorite. His self-doubt really gets me, he isn't sure he's as noble as Sturm but i think he is. Tanis is a quiet, contemplative man, all he wanted was a sedate life. He never wanted to be a hero or a warrior like Sturm and Caramon did and he achieves a complexity and maturity i've seen rarely in a fictional character in a fantasy world. Tanis is the leader and kind of carries the trilogy. There is a moderate grittiness and a certain level of realism in the characters here never achieved by Tolkien.
6304233639|2.0|Well, after all the talk when this movie came out, I just also had to see it. The first time I saw it, I thought it was great, but..... that was also the last time I saw the whole movie.<BR>Now I can only bare the first 50 minutes. Great suspense when the UFOs arrive, a great soundtrack, great acting and very good SFX, but after 50 minutes, after the alien-attack and the destroying of the major cities, this movie changes to a computergame-like childish one-of-many alienmovie in which only ridiculous laserbeam-shooting scenes are presented; no story at all anymore, just shooting, and of course a hero-saves-the-day-predictable-hollywood-happy ending. So when I've got an itch to see this movie, this itch has been scratched after seeing the first 50 minutes, then I turn it off. So, maybe when you are a short-movie-kind-a-person you could like it...
0345409671|5.0|I love this book. In all her books the passion she communicates for life and appreciation for everything beautiful is inspiring to me. The characters are so anguished not just by pain but in a way by beauty which they seem to perceive in a heightened way. I loved this book for her mythology about the creation of the world, angels and humans and memnoch's fall.
0060278250|4.0|Abhorsen is the continued tale of a Lirael who can't seem to find her place in the world of Necromancers, the Dead, and powerful Charter Magick. Lirael, who lost hope of becoming a Clayr (one with Sight), journeys with the Disreputable Dog, Prince Sameth, and Mogget to stop Hedge- a dangerous necromancer. <BR>  As the Abhorsen-in-waiting, it is Lireal's job to try and put a stop to Hedge and the joining of the hemispheres that will unleash a being powerful enough to make the earth a desert of ash.  But first she must rescue Sameth's friend, Nick, who carries the being inside him, and journey though the nine gates of Death to find the how the hemispheres were created.  <BR>  Nix's novel leaves you plesently surprised yet in tears, wanting more of this contageous tale. But it certainly cannot compare with the novel that started it all; Sabriel, by Garth Nix.
0671027344|5.0|Chbosky's short and choppy sentences are no match for the great and eloquent works produced by Shakespeare, but it is through this primitive style that he is able to give life to the character of Charlie. Chbosky's allows the reader to see the world through Charlie's eyes with his child-like mentality and also to share in his experiences. No matter how uncomfortable the situation may be, the reader is thrown into it head first. All the while Charlie is there, like a child telling a story, reporting the scene with excruciating detail and then some. Charlie's character is a freshman in high school and is perceived by others to be a \\"wallflower\\". He sits back and observes the life that surrounds him even though at times it seems it has left him behind and forgotten.<BR> Charlie has the incredible ability to analyze the world around him; he states the painful truth which many choose to avoid. <BR> I believe this to be a great piece of writing because of its overall structure.<BR>Through his word choice and primitive manner, Chbosky is able to set the tone and paint the picture of adolescence in its most simple and raw form.
B000066F6H|5.0|I'm not really reviewing the album tho I do think it's the best punk album I've heard since the good old days of '77.  What brings me here is to point out that a record industry which we knew didn't have a clue has gone to new lengths.  This ENHANCED cd CANNOT be played on a computer, tho it includes MP3s of the videos which CANNOT be played on your DVD player.  So you can watch the video on your computer and play the music on your television but not vice versa.  The Kremlin would have been very proud of this new example of DoubleSpeak.
1570629706|5.0|The story seems simple on the surface.  I believe it depicts an ambivalent attitude about Buddhism, and favors a Taoist way of harmony.  Siddhartha's rejection of dogma or teaching is pure Taoism.  But at the same time Hesse shows that inflation and gratifacation of the ego with pleasure, wealth, etc. is also problematic.  The most memorable line is &quot;the opposite of a truth is also true.  A truth cloaked in words is only one sided.&quot; Paradox, the insistence on the present, the belief that wisdom can only be lived but not expressed in words or taught, the unity of samsara and nirvana is entirely consistent with Taoism or Zen and not Buddhism per se.  Seek without seeking might be the message of the story.  This is only my interpretation and might not be entirely true.  Decide for yourself.
B000066JES|4.0|If you're a Manowar fan, you most likely won't be disappointed with this cd. A lot of the songs seem to be slower than usual. The more upbeat songs areat the end of the cd. If for no other reason, get this cd for their version of &quot;An American Trilogy&quot;. I have always hated Elvis and I've always hated that song, but Manowar does an excellent job and I can appreciate that song a little better now. If you're not too familiar with Manowar yet, I'd recommend Kings Of Metal, Triumph Of Steel, or Battle Hymns first.

B000068PQ0|3.0|Unless you're a science fiction nut, it doesn't take long for an album of songs about killer robots (pink robots, no less) to become unbearably irritating. The rock opera kicks off with \\"Fight Test\\", a song whose verses borrow (quite liberally) the melody from Cat Stevens' \\"Father and Son\\". \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Pt 1\\" is very engaging musically, however once the chorus starts in, imploring the hero Yoshimi to prevent the robots from eating us, the song's impact is diminished. There are some decent moments here to be sure, but overall the effect is one of overkill.
B000000QFY|4.0|Looking at both CD releases (IRS from the early 90s and the Dutch Red Bullet from 2001), they're identical. Both share the same pre-mastering from the very early 90s by Ian Gillespie and Mike Vernon at Tape One. Very misleading that this version is billed as &quot;Original Recording Remastered&quot;. The only difference is that IRS released the first three Focus records only, which share the identical liner notes.
0385484518|3.0|Mitch Albom has put together a tender and moving account of the last years of a brave man fighting against Lou Gehrig's disease.  Morrie Schwartz, a teacher most of his life, contracted ALS when he was in his late seventies.  The prognosis was a few short years before he succumbed to the disease.  Shocked at first, Morrie decided to live life as best he could, while he had time.  He soon realized that one cannot really live until one has learned to die.  The author, Mitch Albom, eighteen years earlier had been a student of Morrie at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.  Mitch had been very close to Professor Schwartz while in college, but drifted away after graduation.  One day he saw Morrie Schwartz being interviewed by Ted Koppel on Television.  Concerned, Mitch visited Morrie.<br />What ensued was a masterfully crafted mixture of weekly meetings with Morrie (on Tuesdays) and reminiscences of earlier meetings when Morrie was healthy and Mitch was in college.  Mitch, a professional sports writer, displays deep talent in getting to the point using few words and using those words skillfully and with compassion.  Many sections will bring tears to your eyes.  Mitch is wrapped up in achieving success and working hard to gain it.  Morrie, in his late seventies, has already gained a deeper, more philosophic view of life.  The biography starts out as a surprisingly intuitive insight of what is really important for all of us if we want to live fulfilling lives.<br />Disappointment, for me, came when Mitch introduced the idea of reincarnation (Morrie would like to come back as a gazelle) and when Mitch was critical of the Book of Job (Morrie thought God overdid it).  I then noticed that the man who was trying to learn how live by learning how to die never mentioned his coming encounter with the God who created him.  Mitch Albom presents a well written book with valuable insights, but he misses the real point of human life:  Why are we here?  What happens when we die?  Surely, an awareness of God has to be an important part of learning how to die.y, an awareness of God has to be an important part of learning how to die.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I own the VHS set of this that came out about 7 years ago.  That was well over 8 hours of Beatles Anthology material on those tapes.  Now, the DVD set will be available with an additional hour and a half of unreleased bonus materials, 5.1 DTS sound, better picture, etc...<br />For those who own the VHS, the DVD is worth picking up because of the special features listed above.  Plus, they have everything in 5 discs as opposed to the bulky 8 tape VHS set.  For those who only watched the 3 part TV Anthology series, remember that this set has an additional 3-4 hours of material not seen on television.<br />If anything get this set so you can hear the songs all over again in amazing 5.1 DTS surround sound.  If you don't have a home theater system, it's time to get one for this great DVD set.  Don't wait to read other reviews to pick up this DVD set.  This is a no-brainer.  Get it on April 1.
0553266306|5.0|I liked this book (and the old movie made from it) because the detective who chased the Jackal wasn't your stereotypical literary/cinematic superhero -- he was physically unimposing and, it was specifically mentioned, a totally henpecked husband.

B00005JLRT|4.0|I have to say i enjoyed Nemesis my only regrets are<BR>that scenes got cut out that shoulda been left in. Watch<BR>the trailers for those deleted scenes. (Worf telling picard to<BR>be cautious, or troi collapsing in the turbolift). With the special editions being released i hope this DVD gets that<BR>treatment. Starting with adding in those scenes, like wesleys<BR>and guinans cut scenes. The movie was great. I read someone in there review say the enterprise keeps having shield problems and so forth. To him i say this Shinzons ship was a SUPER ship<BR>every weapon was shot at it and the enterprise was still in one piece even after it took a pounding. (Try doing that voyager)<BR>Shields may have fallen eventually but come on, it was the only ship still there when all was said and done.<br />...

B000075BFK|5.0|Ive had this album now since the day it came out. For the first few weeks I had it I kinda only listened to a few songs but after listenin to the album proper ive come to the conclusion that this is one of the best album I have ever heard.<br />Im a Tupac fan as much as the next man but no way is my review biased. I mean this is up there with albums such as \\"All eyes on me\\" and \\" me against the world\\".<BR>Sure the beats are not the original tupac beats but it is still one of the best albums I have ever heard. I tend to review tupac albums in two categories, Amazing and good. Albums such as All eyes on me, me against the world and better dayz would for me be categorised as amazing and others such as 2pacalypse, remember me and until the end of time would be in the good category. Not that those were bad albums its just that maybe on them you had songs that you skipped but with albums such as all eyez on me and better dayz there aint a really bad song and thats the truth.<br />My favourite songs off this album are as follows:<br />STILL BALLIN- this song is just a thug tune fo real. I mean the bootleg version is ok but I gotta hand it to the person that made this beat cos its totally bangin. Trick Daddy also does a fine job with his single verse.<br />WHEN WE RIDE ON OUR ENEMIES- This song is reminsent to Tupac's hit em up. I mean it's no way as good (what tune will ever be?).It is a very personal song and is one of my personal favourites off the album. And I actually like the beat. Its kinda dramatic music put in wid gangsta lyrics. Its hot!!<br />NEVER BE PEACE - I like this tune. Its got a kinda arabic - asian theme to it. The beat is good and tupac's lyrics in this song are excellent. The best part of this song is the end for me. Where he just tells everyone why there will never be peace and you can kinda be persuaded here that he is right.<br />THUGZ MANSION FT NAS (ACOUSTIC)- yeah, well alot has been made of this song. After all tupac didnt like nas much. This isactually a good song and its kinda a really good song to chill to. It aint amazing but its one of my favourite songs just to chill out to.<br />CD 2<br />MY BLOCK (REMIX) - Man o man. What can i say about dis tune right here. This is by far the best song on the album. It is his second single off this album and im tellin ya its unbelievable. Don't try downloading it cos u will either get a looped version or maybe a bootleg version that wernt that good to be honest. This song is just brilliant. Its got 4 verses which is unusual but its just the tupac lyrics and then the children singin in the hook that makes this song so good. Its kinda like the song changes in a way, cos he talks about emotional stuff. If you like songs like changes, dear mama, life goes on then you have to hear this. The best!!<br />THUGZ MANSION - the beat to this is hot. the lyrics are similar to the acoustic version.<br />BETTER DAYZ - at first i thought this song kinda weird. But after listenin to it a few times i started hearin the lyrics for what they are, They say there is a clue in here about his death but i dunno.<br />U CAN CALL - Nice song with pac and jazze pha on the hook. Its a song about pac waitin for a trick to call him.<br />FAIR EXCHANGE REMIX - Hot hot hot. Its a sex song. Just like the song he did wid kaci and jojo. Cmon baby bounce on me. woooooo<br />THEY DONT GIVE A F*CK ABOUT US - This song is the second best song off the album. I mean ya gotta hear dis. Its so real and its what tupac does best. Ya never see a ja rule or jay z doin a song like dis cos they wouldnt know how. Tupac was a leader and he could see this kinda stuff and he brought it out in his lyrics. Purely amazing.<br />There is also a hidden track if u can call it where pac is allegedly sayin he be back.<BR>Thats the list of songs. It aint all of em its just the ones i like off the album. It may look like a lot but its pac and the quality of his songs is amazing.<br />If ya wana get to know pac for his music isuggest maybe you purchase the greatest hits cd or maybe all eyez on me as most songs on greatest hits are from that album and I also suggest you buy this cos its another one of the albums that people will never forget. Its made its mark with all eyez on me and me against the world.<br />truly a masterpeice.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie had it all, from great and talented actors/actresses to great direction this truly was a great movie. I have read the books and yes, i am upset that the facts are loosely based around the books, but the movies capture the significant parts. I praise the people who were brave enough to make this into a movie and make it work so well. You can see the bonds between the actors and it ( in the movie) even cracks a few jokes. If your worried about the time, its almost 3 1/2 hours long, dont, it goes by fast. They picked excellent and admorable people to do this movie and all of the time and the effort that went into these movies really shows. They are great movies and are worth your time.
B00006F7S4|4.0|This CD is so good!  It is mellow but every single song is fantastic.  I really don't have a favorite tune but &quot;Guess I'm Doing Fine&quot; is the one I relate to the most.  Beck is one of the smartest songwriters today.  He knows exactly how to get his ideas across in a way that is reconigzable.  It's simple but powerful.  Best CD of 2002 followed by Yoshimi.
B00008K79Q|5.0|Ok, its worth seeing but not worth owning at this price. So you may want to wait to buy. But the story is wondeful. If you didn't see it in the theater you will want to. In some ways its a hard story to watch. These people obviously mean well but they have no clue what they are doing the the families involved. What is totally disheartening is that this same sort of resettlement went on in the USA and Canada as well. Cultural imperialism. You will be rooting for the kids.
B00005RFAI|1.0|What the hell?  Does she not know to spell correctly or is this her way of being 'smooth'?  All I can say, Pink tries too hard.  Reminds me of Avril.  Learn how to spell, THEN write your own lyrics.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I remember setting in the theater when a trailor for an action movie staring Matt Damon came on screen.  Needless to say I sat there and felt the pain wash over me.  I thought to myself, &quot;What the hell is pretty boy doing in an action movie muchless pulling off roundhouse kicks?  That movie will bite the big one!&quot;  Needless to say it feels so good to be so wrong.<br />The Bourne Identity was one of the sleeper hits of this past year because of how effective it was.<br />Action movies fall in two subgenres...the Aronld action movies were he doesn't get hurt and if he does he's OK to run/shoot/punch/pilot a plane within a matter of seconds (nothing wrong with these types of movies).  Then you have REAL action movies.  The one where the hero could get hurt and the action is not overthetop unrelisticly.<br />The movie is put a great looking and sounding disc.  The extras are OK but I was really into the other ending.  If they claim it on the back of the box then it better be good and this one is.

B00007BK2N|5.0|First off I want to thank Winterbottom for a WONDERFUL representation of Joy Division and dedication to Ian Curtis. This movie spans from the begining of the Manchester Punk scene (Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Stranglers, Clash etc.) to the begining of the Manchester Rave scene, and the involvement of Tony Wilson through it all. How his record company signed major Post-Punk bands like Joy Division and later signed post-JD electronic band New Order. Starting off as a club owner for bands to play at called The Factory, starting a record label with the same name to sign these bands that played there, and leading up to catching onto the electronic sound that came from Manchester, starting the legendary club Hacienda forming the Rave scene, leading to the demise of it all. It followed, as it was made to be, only one aspect of music history in this particular era. Now that this part of the era is covered, I would love to see more about how the bands influenced music. Lets see here, we have Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees, two very influential bands that lead to the forming of what we know as Goth Rock, we have Beggers Banquet with Bauhaus leading to '80's Goth/Death Rock. We also have the beginings of Industrial music. Will this happen? Probably not, though at the same time I wouldn't MGM or whoever to release something on these aspects of underground subculture, maybe we best stick with Mick Mercer on that one.

1402532903|4.0|Has there ever been a time were you wondered, if we all go to different Heavens? On December 6, 1973, Susie Salmon answered that question, after being crucially raped then murdered. The Lovely Bones novel is an excellent choice for a mature reader. Alice Sebold tells a great story of a young girl who was murdered and continues to watch over her family in \\"her\\" Heaven. She gives great description of Susie Salmon's sort of Heaven, and the gazebo that Susie watches over her family in. The book shows how each of the characters are connected, and how each are coping with the death of Susie. <BR> The Lovely Bones, was wrote in simple/technical format, in 2002. Alice wrote a very powerful book, full of very descriptive writing. I thought this book was well written, gave a lot of edge, that would make one want to keep reading. In this book she showed that she was an author that could get a readers attention, and keep it. The Lovely Bones was a well thought out book, and even though Susie narrates the story from Heaven, it was very realistic.<BR>         liked this book because it was a murder story. If I could change one thing, I think I would have ended it differently. I recommend this book to a mature audience of readers who are interested in an excellent murder story.
B00005RYLE|5.0|If you are a horror fan, in particular a fan of zombie flicks, this movie is for you.  If you're more of the Scream/ I Know What You Did Last Summer type of horror fan then you probably won't appreciate this movie.  If you haven't seen it be prepared for significant gore (the only way to kill the zombies is dismemberment).  Overall, this film is something of a cult classic among horror fans and for good reason.
B00000G3HZ|4.0|I'm a bit hesitant about reviewing this movie, since I am only 18 years old and from a whole different generation. But I did see some dilemmas portrayed in this movie that was revelant to my life and my peers'. I do think I'm entitled to some complaints, though. First of all, the biggest setback for me was that I was not able to feel, and believe the grief from the eight. This is a wonderful cast- William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, Jobeth Williams, Jeff Goldblum,etc- who all moved on to great things. I'm sure they must have at least the common sense and acting talent to really wring out a believeable amount of grief for their friend whom committed suicide. Although I was impressed with Glenn Close's performance, because she seemed to be the only one who truly grieved. The most intimate scene is her naked in the shower, crying her eyes out. I found that scene especially poignant because I could feel her sadness, and I lost that as the movie progressed. They seemed to forget about Alex as they whined about their lives. To me, Sarah(Close) was the only one who felt the loss, because she brought up Alex as they're sitting around the dinner table, and then pours her heart out. Then after that, it goes kind of haywire. But it was Close who sort of kept the movie together, like the stitches holding together Alex's wrist wounds during the opening credits.<BR> There  was another thing that moved me-Harold(Kline) agreeing to get Meg(Place) pregnant because her supposedly biological clock is ticking and she can't get a man to inseminate her. As she put it, &quot;These are my favorite men in the world&quot;, therefore narrowing the list down to Harold, Sam, and Michael (Nick's out of the picture because it seems like he recieved an 'owie' during 'Nam). So, in the end Harold's the lucky winner. Sarah cheerfully gives up her husband to Meg for one night. That really grabbed my attention because, who in the HELL would do a thing like that? There's way too much mess involved.That really stood out for me, because in a way it convinced me that these eight would do anything for each other. They share the same blood, thoughts, and running shoes. <BR> So, don't miss this, because the intimacy is worth tasting for one night.
B00005JGAB|5.0|I laugh at people who inform me that the Sex Pistols were \\"the first true punk band.\\" They need to brush up on their history--without the Ramones in 1976 there would be no Sex Pistols, no Clash, and hell, no punk rock genre. Without the Ramones we would all still be listening to Yes and ELP. The Ramones began the revolution, and still outstrip most of their peers (including the aforementioned Sex Pistols).<br />These guys, though hardly possessing any knowledge of how to use their instruments, were the epitome of cool. With loud fast power chords from Johnny, lots of attitude, and seemingly goofball (actually ingenious) lyrics penned by Joey, the 1976 debut's songs rip off the starting line with Dee Dee's \\"1-2-3-4!\\" and end with a bang. 14 songs rip by in 26 minutes, and the rush never gets old. Who can't get Blitzkrieg Bop, Judy Is A Punk, and Beat On The Brat out of their heads?<br />The Ramones were both revitalists and innovators, taking the riffs and back-to-basics rock of Chuck Berry and Eddie Cochran, adding the humor and subversiveness of early Who recordings, and then playing the mix at hyperdrive. Nobody ever played rock like this before. Music execs at the time were baffled and radio stations wouldn't give them a lick of airplay. But a fanatical cadre of fans, along with critics who \\"got\\" it, turned these boys from NYC into stars.<br />You can't call yourself a \\"punk\\" until you possess a Ramones recording. In fact, if you don't love the Ramones you should write off rock music altogether and take up knitting. To call their debut \\"influential\\" would be like calling WWII a \\"police action.\\" Buy your copy, and don't forget to check out the Damned's debut and The Clash's first album.
0312305060|3.0|An inspired book about women by a man.  What else is new?  I wanted to say, again and again - \\"A woman wouldn't say...do...that.\\"  <br />It's really a gay book about gay men, I think.  Even the gay women are more like gay men.  <br />The movie's better.  I recommend it, except for Nicole Kidman's ridiculously bulbous, clown-like nose.  Virginia Woolf had a lovely, noble Roman nose.  HEL-LO, HOLLYWOOD!<br />The book is an attempt to copy Mrs. Dalloway, a brilliant, light-filled, organic work of art.  This is a contrivance.<br />Still, it is obviously inspired.  And it's made a splash. But the book underwhelmed me, unlike my reading of the real Mrs. Dalloway, which I adored.<br />By the way, the best section is about Mrs. Brown...I wished the whole book was about her.
B00003CXS4|5.0|A truely great movie if you like British humor.  A really good movie if you can follow films with the bastardized version of English that the British speak (THATS A JOKE, don't be offended).  If you have trouble following British accents, then this film is not for you.<br />It's a darkly comidic romp through England when a diamond is stolen, then stolen again, then stolen some more.  Oh yeah, and it all starts because someone wants to get a good deal on a used caravan (5th wheel in American English).<br />Must see if you like different movies.
B00005B6C9|4.0|I've always been a big fan of harmony, whether the Four Freshmen, the Mills Brothers, or the Fifth Dimension, but not including any of the ubiquitous boy bands out nowadays, who could seriously use a master class from either the Brothers Gibb or any of the previously-mentioned people. I'll describe what I liked and disliked about what I heard on this particular collection:<br />WALKING ON AIR should have been the ultimate summer song. I visualize windsurfing on Lake Hefner or sidewalk surfing in Will Rogers Park. It would have been better than Sheryl Crow's \\"Soak Up the Sun\\" or that Young Rascals theft from a couple years ago by Sugar Ray, and it would have been more original, too. One thing I have to give the Bee Gees their props for, they turn their noses up at sampling. Why shouldn't they? They are good enough musicians to create their own sound.<br />EMBRACE seems straight out of the Eurythmics' catalog for some reason. Put on quality headphones and set your iTunes equalizer for Dance on this one for the ultimate effect.<br />I really like MAN IN THE MIDDLE. Maurice's deeper voice is a nice change from the falsettos one tends to always hear. I'm not that familiar with the earlier Bee Gees recordings, but I feel good that, in light of Maurice's recent death, you get to hear how capable he was of being a lead singer. For some reason, the voice reminds me of Ringo Starr...<br />SHE KEEPS ON COMING is another one of those songs you imagine being performed by someone else..in this case, by a band who also will never perform again, The Cars. I keep superimposing Ric Ocasek in the lead vocal for some reason. I really like listening to it while driving down I-35.<br />I guess if there's one song that's hard for me to totally give thumbs up to, it's VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS. I mean, I appreciate their experimentation with different sounds, as is their right. They were definitely a versatile bunch, those BeeGees! But..I don't know, this is too weird for me. I say that, though, and I find myself tapping my toe to it! Jury's still out, I guess. Gotta say, though, whoever's playing lead guitar can really kick butt! This might be a good song for, I don't know, Black Sabbath, or even Loverboy??<br />The song I'm NOT ambivalent about is LOOSE TALK COSTS LIVES. I can't stand Barry Gibb sounding so much like Michael Franks! It gives me the willies.<br />I kind of wish THE EXTRA MILE wasn't so...I don't know...bombastic. The instruments are a little overpowering here, and they don't need to be, in my opinion. I can see this as a great ballad for somebody else, who can give it the treatment I think it deserves.<br />I think TECHNICOLOR DREAMS is cute! Give `em the old soft shoe! I imagine they performed songs that weren't much different than this when they were kids.<br />SACRED TRUST starts out like a funeral, but it's actually one of the better songs for me.<br />The CD comes with a QuickTime video, which for some reason drives my iMac crazy! Since I hadn't really seen the Bee Gees on TV since they used to host the Midnight Special in the early 70's, it was fun to see them again, and interesting to notice how they've changed over the years. (I didn't think it was possible for Robin to ever get better looking without major surgery; proves one should never say \\"never\\".) I recommend both this and \\"Still Waters\\" from the mid-nineties for those like me who had wondered what became of this British power-trio since the 70s, who seemed to have given up on recordings and make their money writing songs for others (which is where the REAL money is, anyway).<br />This is one of two CDs by the Bee Gees I was given, like a lot of people I guess, after the death of Maurice Gibb. I was happy to get them, happy that both were such quality recordings, but a little bittersweet knowing that this one especially is the last of the Bee Gees studio recordings, unless they change their mind in the future.ugh, and I find myself tapping my toe to it!

B00003CXS4|5.0|If you are a fan of \\"British\\" movies like the Pythons and others, you will love this film.  If you aren't, but are ok with the British accent, this is still a great film.  If you hate listening to the British trash the American Language (that an American joke, don't be offended) then you will not like this film.  <br />I have seen this film quite a few times and let me say this.  I liked it the first time I saw it, but each time I watch it, I find more nuances that I like even more.... Plus, now I can understand Pikey (the accent Brad Pitt uses) without the subtitles.<br />Also, you can check out an old
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is by far one of the all-time best movies ever made.  Joel Coen does an excellent job of translating Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" into a modern-day (well, Depression-era US) story, while keeping the audience entertained and riveted to the screen.<br />Our story starts with Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete, and Delmar off to find \\"the treasure\\", which is supposed to be $1 million dollars.  \\"1.2, to be exact.\\"  But our boys soon find themselves mixed up in all kinds of adventures, from being \\"in a tight spot\\", to \\"singing in a can\\", to finding out Everett has been hit by a train and his wife's new beau (\\"He's a suitor!\\") to being \\"bona fide\\".<br />This movie really has it all - a great musical soundtrack, outstanding acting, good storyline, and, most importantly, a happy ending.  What else could a guy want out of a movie?  Explosions?  Yes, even in this movie will you find a police truck filled with ammo exploding at a farmhouse.<br />This movie is a must have for any collection.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I was disappointed when I saw the Fast and the Furious because I was one of the few that saw this movie before F&F.  Vin plays such a bad mofo that he makes disgruntled postal employees look happy.  It was the ideal role to break him.  The acting is solid although fairly stereotypical for a scary movie.  Good flick with some good cinematic features (love the cranked whiteness).  A definate must for anyone that likes sci-fi based scary movies (like Aliens, etc).
B00006WUWN|2.0|To tell you the truth, i've never really been a big fan of the Austin Powers movies, but i really thought there was no need for a third. The first two were enough laughs for everyone who enjoys these movies and Mike Myers should use his talents and create something new. I think i may of prefered it if it came out a few years later as in 'the long awaited movie' and then it would have been more enjoyable.
0316666343|4.0|On her way home from school on a snowy December day, Susie Salmon is lured into underground burrow in the cornfield by her neighbour, Mr. Harvey.  Susie is then brutally raped and murdered.  When we join Susie she is already in her heaven, watching her family and friend deal with her disappearance and then slowly accept her death though they have found no body, no leads and no killer.<BR> <BR>This story is not about Susie's rape or murder but rather about her family as they cope with losing their daughter and sister.  It is about Susie adjusting to her new home.  Her father embarks on catching her killer, her mother strays from her family, her sister engrosses herself in sports, studies and her boyfriend, her little brother Bucky, just tries to stay out of the way.  <br />This novel has had a lot of hype this year and made all the bestsellers list, like it should.  It was an excellent debut novel by Alice Sebold, she told a story that didn't focus on the rape and murder but of the life after.  The story opened my eyes to what heaven can be and how that won't be the same for everyone.  The idea of that my deceased loved ones are watching me brings me great comfort.
076790382X|5.0|I'm A Stranger Here Myself reflects the Bryson of latter years seen in &quot;A Walk In The Woods&quot; and &quot;In a Sunburned Country.&quot;  Wry, witty and full of good humour and laugh out loud moments.<br />I enjoyed this collection of his weekly columns very much.  Bryson turned two years worth of weekly observations on American life done for an English periodical into this book.  What informs Brits will delight Americans as Bryson explores American trends, small town life and his personal experiences as the expatriate returned with English bride and children in tow.<br />This collection runs the gamut.  Bryson muses on the wonders of his hometown post office (with an annual customer appreciation day), American statistics pulled from the census (his piece on the number of us injured by our bedding -- sheets, pillows and spreads -- every year is a riot), travel over our vast expanses, his local coffee shop, his very own garden and English gardener (his wife), and very many other et ceteras.<br />This is an eclectic selection.  Although in some places the American reader may find some articles over-explained (one has to keep in mind he was writing for a foreign audience), this is a very well written collection of short essays.  <br />The confident Bryson humor is here, as well as his excellent use of language and sentence structure.  Whereas I thought some of Bryson's early works tried for too much humor and sometimes seemed forced as well as overly sarcastic, here the author is content to share interesting thoughts and stories punctuated by yuks.  This writer does have an engaging way with words.  There are laugh-out-loud moments in the book and generally it is a very pleasant light diversion.  Worth the read.
B000084T18|3.0|Damn man \\"50 cent\\". WHA! I heard this album, and it aint nothin but AVERAGE. I have hear nelly albums like this (damn that is bad) He is strictly pop, dre aint fallen off, but this guys was never on top. he has great ppl feeaturing, but he is more of a hippocrit than Jah (rule (the fool). He is a wannabe rapper, stay on the block 50ty? yeh sure, i would do the same, its just about money right? Hip pop sells more. If y'all want some real hip hop then check out J-LIVE, TUPAC, DEAD PREZ, METHOD MAN. and old school NWA. This guys is for all the people who watch too much t.v and believe in the hype, even i did, but the rapper has only got a few hot joints, he repeats himself, watch his next album, it'll be the same. AVERAGE.
0441003257|1.0|This book tries too hard to be funny and zany and \\"wicked.\\"  But the humor is lame, and its satirical targets are so old.  No, it's not like Monty Python.<br />Story concerns a child antichrist who doesn't want to start Armagedon.  Instead, he wants to play with his dog.  That's wicked?  That's sacreligious?  That's nothing!<br />The old theme of a reluctant Christ/antichrist was much better handled in Hal Hartley's indie film, Book Of Life.<br />There's one good line in this book, about Ygor \\"clocking overtime\\" because there's no thunderstorm.  That's it.<br />As an example of \\"trying too hard\\" to be funny, near the end of the book, a character flies through the air on a scooter, wearing a pink helmet.  Why pink?  I guess because it's zanier that way.  An authority figure whose helmet is pink!  Ha, ha!  How subversive!<br />Zzzzzzz.
0151008116|1.0|This book is the kind of shallow meaningless tripe that makes not-so-bright people feel sophisticated. Right down to the cop-out ending, it's a mishmash of trite cliches, meaning-of-life tidbits at about the level of the old &quot;Kung Fu&quot; TV series, and...a premise he ripped off from another writer's book! If you liked &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; you're sure to love this. But if you have a real mind, stick to Rushdie.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This movie is surprisingly very funny ,entertaining and too cute almost. Hugh Grant is always the perfect role for these romantic comedies. This movie reflects on the social aspect of an adolescent boy who is an outcast and a grown up man (who is actually still an immature &quot;boy&quot;)who has everything but does not know his path in life. Together they found and helped each other find happiness. This film is a must for DVD collector's.
B000000OEI|5.0|From one of the best composers in modern cinema, one of the best soundtracks to a movie of this kind. Bombastic, Patriotic and filled to the edge with dramatic synths and orchestras. This is top action music, in the same class as The Rock. No doubt since Hans Zimmer also worked on the Rock, signing his incredible style like no one else.<BR>There are only 5 songs on Crimson Tide, but they are very good. Alabama is totally unbelivable, 22 minutes non stop wonderful filmscore. Mutiny is bombastic and explosive, it just kicks you right into the sub and back again! <BR>Its so hard to write a good, serious review of this album. It just raises your hair and kinda takes your stomach on an epic journey, an emotionalfilled ride thru the best moments of the movie. The Rock did the same thing, however I have not yet decided which one is the best. <BR>There are other sub soundtracks out there, most well known is the equal Hunt for Red October, and comparing them is hard. Very hard. They both got their up`s and downs, but my feeling is that Crimson Tide sounds very american(NOT a bad thing!), while Red October sounds more..real. They both excel most of the competition of soundtracks on the market, but ends up staggering each others sides...just like the two main characters in the movie.<br />I give up writing a good review for this one, just buy it and love it. It is just so fantastic.

B00005JK8K|4.0|This movie brings the reality of war home like no other.  Beginning scenes are reminiscent of the Viet Nam atrocities, but this was an earlier war with those dreaded Japs in 1944.<br />    We learn of the enormous contributions our Native Americans' skill helped to deflect the enemy.  We owe so much to the folks who really belong here, those who inhabited this country first.  Indians are not all alcoholics or slow learners.  There are some geniuses as in our Caucasian population.<br />    The questionable loss of life in any war is so apparent here.  Because the South conceded victory in 1865, the Southern soldier is portrayed as ignorant with his dialect, though he is proclaiming his pride in representing his country.<br />     Some scenes of the fighting look identical to the Frank Sinatra movie, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.  One shows a beautiful native American in a SOUTH PACIFIC paradise until he is confronted by an \\"ignorant\\" soldier from the South telling him, The only difference between you and the Japs is that uniform.\\"<br />    The Indian playing his wood flute accompanied by the GI on his harmonica is a moving interlude as we watch the jeeps transporting a battallion through the jungle, straight into an ambush by their own men.  The main windtalker proudly shows a picture of his wife and son George named after the first president of the United States.  He is a veritable Alvin York.<br />   Such a waste of young American men who never reach the prime of their lives as all our wars succeed in doing.  Our young men are sacrifices to unendurable agony and mental distress.<br />    Nicholas Cage, though not possessing matinee idol looks, proves his worth as an actor.  He gave a masterful performance.<br />   The Indians were invaluable to the outcome of this war.  It's too bad we put them into reservations and supplied alcohol to dull their memories and demean their achievements on behalf of this country.<br />   This movie shows the realism of the devastation to the human spirit by war.

B00003CXSM|5.0|I assumed that the only thing going for this movie was the top-notch celebrities because the plot seemed so Hollywood-hokey. Therefore, I had not interest in watching it until recently when nothing else was in at the library.  I absolutely loved it!  From now on I will keep an open mind because this was one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in years!  I was never a fan of Matthew McConaughey or Jay-Lo before, but they both sparkled in this one.  I think I even fell in love with Matthew for a second, he was so charming.  Even my husband (who prefers action-packed violence and gore in flicks) enjoyed it.  Thumbs up, 5 stars, A+, or whatever- The Wedding Planner will make you smile!
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is a wonderful film about a man's love for his family, and his determination to keep them alive. This is one of those rare films that make you cry and laugh at the same time.<BR>No wonder this film won three Academy Awards!
B00005JLRR|3.0|I really hoped Berman and Co. would have learned from the previous mis-steps which littered the previous TNG films. It was not to be.<br />My trepidation began while reading an overview of the film and subsequent interview with Rick Berman. During the hype session, Mr. Berman purported that his writing team had come up with the Ultimate Villain (UV). I remember thinking, \\"Gee, more ultimate than the Borg?\\" I always thought ultimate meant the best of ... seems Berman really didn't mean it when he called the Borg the \\"Ultimate Villain\\" for Star Trek: First Contact. Why Paramount insists on creating a single entity antagonist is beyond me. I think this is Wrath of Khan-itis. With the exception of First Contact, none of the TNG films are distinguishable from each other. Ridiculous crazed villain, with insane idea runs across Picard and crew and is thwarted.<br />I'm not going to over-analyze or take pot shots here (okay, maybe I am), but the performances in this film were not terribly well executed. Even Patrick Stewart looks flat and over-facinated by the whole Shinzon issue. There wasn't this much rue in the First Contact movie. Further more, was this intended as a comedy? I can't remember the last time I heard so many startled guffaws (many of them my own) at a non-comedy billed film. The destroyed viewscreen and subsequent Starfleet crewmember being sucked out into space, anyone? You cannot tell me that you watch this sequence without laughing out loud. Any too many ridiculous action movie cliches; from Data's final act, to Riker's \\"tense\\" fight in the bowels of the ship ... it was too predicatable and not well executed. I couldn't help feeling this film has such a narrow and isolated scope, despite the nefarious aims of the UV.<br />Another gripe was with Shinzon's desire to destroy Earth. I couldn't get why this was so important. How this plan would make the universe better for Reman's was far beyond me. It reminded me of 1950's sci-fi where the evil menace just HAD to destroy the world just for the sake of doing so. <br />\\"Ultimately\\", this film seemed just as contrived and shallow as Insurrection, which at least had better performances by the cast. There was absolutely nothing for the actors to do. They visit Romulus. Meet Shinzon. Picard gets warm and fuzzy with the UV. UV snaps, wants Picard's life essence. UV also wants to destroy Earth. Enterprise and crew chase down UV and his Ultimate Weapon. TNG crew prevail. That's it! Mildly entertaining stuff, but not even close as the best Trek adventure.<br />And before anyone feels that I'm an outsider looking in, this is not so. I can go toe-to-toe with anyone when it comes to Trek. I just prefer not to wear rose colored sunglasses.
B000060OFT|4.0|I love the movie Moulin Rouge and I think that Baz Luhrmann is very talented, however I didn't feel as gratified with this movie as much as Moulin Rouge.  It is certainly bright and colorful like all Luhrmann's movies and the changes made to it to bring it to the modern times are quite ingenius, but I felt that it lacked something.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but what might have turned me off are the needless scenes of endless shooting.

0385720920|3.0|I'll spare you from a long drawn out review on this one - I'll just throw in my two cents worth on top of everyone else's.<br />This is the first book that I've read by Palahniuk, and it was good.  I'll be honest that what made me pick up this book was that I thought Fight Club was a great movie (just can't bring myself to reading the book after seeing the movie) and was curious as to what some of the author's other works are about.<br />I watched Fight Club not to long before reading this one and well ... I felt like I was reading Fight Club II.  There were a good deal of the same underlying themes, as well as part of the storyline seemed to be recycled (the support groups).  It could be that I just saw the movie and was trying to hard, but how could you not notice that simularity?<br />Don't get me wrong, it is a good book it held your interest and had all the twists and turns that you would expect - I was just expecting something a bit different.  Palahniuk is quite a good writer, I just hope in he's not resting on the successful story line of Fight Club and recycling it in his future works.<br />All and all though, a good read.

B000020617|4.0|This 1999 album from Foo Fighters opened eyes and ears everywhere. A lot of non-rock fans had this album, and it's really easy to understand why. There are some songs that'll just make you listen, like \\"Gimme Stitches\\" and \\"Generator\\". This is basically because the production is like something I've never heard.<br />Other great songs on the album are the first two singles: \\"Learn To Fly\\" and \\"Breakout\\". And if you're looking for a song with a message, check out \\"Ain't It the Life\\" (which is what you'll be saying while listening to the album).<br />I didn't listen to their new album One By One yet, but if they continue with great stuff like \\"All My Life\\", I'm sure I won't be disappointed.
B00008DDXB|5.0|Then you will enjoy this film.  All the actors that come from the first film, return in the second installenet of the highly popular Harry Potter series.  Actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and even Tom Felton seem much more at ease in this film.  <br />The story opens with Harry escaping from his aunt and uncle in a flying car and goes on to have Harry and his compatriots fighting giant spiders, being pursued by the school's caretaker, Argus Filch, dealing with a self-absorbed teacher, and of course, lets not forget the giant snake.  All while trying to find out what is petrifying muggle-born students.  A more exciting Quidditch match and a scene in which students are learning to \\"duel\\", makes this film a bit more scary and still fun for its viewers.<br />As a parent, and having read the book beforehand, I was a bit unsure of having my son see this film.  He, however, enjoyed it very much.  I would like to see all the books on film but I don't think they would go to that extent,after all, those actors are kids and deserve not to spend their whole youth playing characters from books.  I am sure they will all have careers beyond Harry Potter.
B000000H7I|5.0|It is more than a decade ago, and there I was sampling the sounds of Slayer and Sepultura. But I wanted more, so I checked out Cannibal Corpse. I thought - 'hey, this is something else!' And THEN I heard Suffocation. I was left speechless. At the time, I think no one was even close. The sheer agression for its own sake, the pummeling guitars, the otherworldly guttural vocals, the mad as hell blast beats - it was PERFECT. Now, we have bands that are still building on the kind of thing that Suffocation started, such as Cryptopsy. But, there is nothing like the original. So if you are a newbie Death Metal fan and have not heard this band, do yourself a favor and listen to the forefathers. Yes, 'Pierced' was great, a worthy follow-up, but I have to say that the vocals should have remained like the ones on 'Effigy.'  Get your dose of pure, unadulterated Metal insanity.

The center ring is a real treat -- the crime itself, a woman handcuffed and stripped naked, left to suffocate with a plastic bag taped around her throat. <br />What a cruel, despicable movie. It pretends to be about anti-death penalty activists and the lengths to which they will go to prove their point that the death penalty is wrong, but it is not a point that should be made by the activists, nor the movie. The death penalty is too important an issue to be tied up in such a crude, mean-spirited thriller.<br />Kevin Spacey barely registers as David Gale, a former University of Texas professor and leader of Deathwatch, who is now slated to get the death penalty for the murder of Deathwatch colleague Constance Holloway (Laura Linney). Gale, a brilliant, often drunk hothead, got put on the world's disavowed list after being falsely accused of rape by a expelled grad student. The fake rape itself is a real treat, shown in all its brutal glory. Gale's wife, a philanderer herself, nonetheless takes the opportunity to stick it to him, taking Gale's son to Spain -- Gale will never see him again -- and e-mailing him to ask for a divorce. \\"P.S.\\" the note says, \\"I'm selling the house.\\" <br />About that point I'm thinking, oh boy. But then Gale, who was a tenured professor and must have saved up some money along the way, moves into a tenement apartment building, complete with a pool filled with mud, where he spends his days calling Spain again and again and again. Uh-huh.<br />How Constance dies, and why, you can discover, if you wish. There is little doubt as Gale's fate on the row, nor his role in Constance's death, if you're paying much attention. What's so offensive is that the movie makes all of this seem honorable, which it is most certainly not, and does so by playing up the miseries of Gale's life beyond any reasonable standard, and squeezing a little harder for effect.<br />Spacey plays Gale like a fool. No subtlety here; it's like he means to act as he's being informed by the tag team K-Pax and Verbal on how to do it. Once the whole truth is \\"revealed,\\" you understand the performance, but you don't admire it. The reverse is true for Laura Linney, who bravely plays a sad, sweet, caring, forgiving school marm who makes a decision we cannot possibly comprehend. Was she crazy? Influenced? We don't know. The movie, because it is not about her choice but about throwing smoke into the moviegoers eyes, will not discuss it.<br />I have not mentioned Kate Winslet. She plays the reporter to whom Gale tells his story; she is essentially used in a sickening, cruel way. I am not sure what she is doing in this movie, a slave to the idiocy of her role, going to and fro like a plot puppet. <br />I love Kate Winslet.She is a master at divining the center of a role -- much like Meryl Streep -- and seeing that core through; she creates three dimensions where there have only been one to begin with. She can play lead, she can support, she can sidekick; there are few actors better at filling in the blanks.<br />But she is powerless here. Absolutely powerless. In terms of intelligence and ferocity, she is Spacey's equal, and yet she is under a virtual spell in his presence. Why? <br />My guess is Winslet followed the lead of the director, Alan Parker, and Spacey, for she thought she was in league with kings. And, at times, both Parker and Spacey have done great work. But both are given to shameless grandstanding and intellectual subversion, and it serves them both very poorly here. <br />I'm sure they're proud of the statement they have made, and the brutality with which they made it, but \\"The Life of David Gale\\" couldn't have been any worse if George W. Bush himself sat onscreen and preached for two hours.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson is my Idol. I suffer from agorophobia so I don't get to travel.  But I vicarioulsly get to travel through books like this. Bill Bryson is very detailed and he must do a ton of research. In this book he travels through the whole of Australia and stops at all the interesting places. The wonderful thing with Brysons books is you get to laugh and learn at the same time. I have systematically started reading all of his books, but I am almost afraid to real all of them for there will be no others.  Weather You give a hoot about Australia or not you will get a hoot out of this book.
0694526088|2.0|I bought this (audio) book because I want to beleive that any organization can become a great one, not just ones that are &quot;born&quot; great.  Of course, what I really want to know is how to make my organization a great one.  This book did not tell me what I really wanted to know.<br />The author excels at developing catchy metaphors - &quot;Level 5 Leadership&quot;, &quot;The Hedgehog Concept&quot;, &quot;The Flywheel vs The Doom Loop&quot;.  In narration, the author hams it up.  I think he went to the William Shatner/Capt. Kirk school of dialog.  The spinning flywheel metaphor just gets out of hand.<br />But like many &quot;good&quot; books, the concepts are identified and explained with little info on how to actually use them.  For example, in discussing the &quot;Hedgehog&quot; concept, the author notes that one must identify the organization's key metric and manage to that.  He sites Walgreen's income-per-customer visit metric as a key example.  What I didn't hear was any advice/guidance on how to identify the key metric for the organization.  What good is this knowledge if I can't use it?  Also, I'm pretty sure that Warren Buffet uses more than one metric to measure the performance of his investments, so I question the wisdom.<br />It's a similar story with &quot;Level 5 Leadership&quot;.  Again there is description, but little direction on how to become or even spot such a leader.  To be fair, I think the author is more concerned with skewering the &quot;Charismatic&quot; leader type such as Lee Iacocca or the ever-popular Al &quot;Chainsaw&quot; Dunlap.  He makes his point well in this regard, but of course, we all like to build heroes then tear them down - see Jack Welch.<br />His penultimate section is the whole flywheel vs doom loop story.  In essence, find a good strategy and stick with it.  Flailing about chasing every management fad is a bad idea.  I agree with this, but it's not exactly a secret found in only the dead sea scrolls.  A more useful approach would be how to recognize when you are in a doom loop, what causes it, and how do you get out.  I heard none of this, but there was this 2 minute bit with spinning flywheel - &quot;faster and faster...etc.&quot;  I kept waiting to hear Mr. Scott in the background &quot;I'm givin' ya all she's got Cap'n!&quot;.<br />All in all, entertaining.  I'd get the CD version to listen during your commuting time.  For serious reads, try Michael Porter.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink has surpassed the public's expectations of her former R&amp;B/pop persona to show her extreme talent &amp; become the Pat Benatar of this decade. This album appeals to teens but reaches adult women as well.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|Take your bargain-basement copies of Fritz Lang's _Metropolis_ and throw them away.  This restored edition from Kino DVD is the real McCoy.<br /><br />Even though about 25% of the film is still missing (and will probably never be found), this is the most complete version we have to date.  _Metropolis_ is a Fabian-socialist fever dream, the ultimate film maudit, and possibly one of the best movies ever made.  Rent or buy, but by all means see it.<br /><br />UPDATE (August 2008): Most of the missing 25% has now been found.  We can expect a new, improved DVD release within a year or two.
B00007L4MJ|2.0|I had a long argument with KINO after this restoration was released in the theaters. I know how difficult it would have been to release it theatrically at anything other than 24 fps. But with the DVD, we finally had a chance to see this film at the correct speed! They refused.<br />The claims of 24 being the \\"authentic\\" speed all rest on one score that actually has \\"28 fps\\" hand-written on it. I think that was just somene's error.<br />The simple fact is that if you watch the film, it is clearly shot at silent speed. People are sped-up at 24fps, as they are in all silent films. It's painful to watch.<br />So sad - KINO could've included a version at the correct speed, even with no sound - I would've happily played my own music while I watched this beautiful restoration at the right speed.  As it is, we have a gorgeous print with characters who move like the Keystone Cops - what a missed opportunity.
B000003FMY|5.0|I first heard this performance of Pictures on an old LP i borrowed from a horn player friend who worships the CSO and reiner, and I was amazed from the beginning. I had heard the opening fanfare many times, not knowing what it was from. i am definitely partial to this rendition, but in my humble opinion it is the best I've heard, including koussevitzky's with the old BSO, the man who asked ravel to orchestrate it...that recording is also amazing but the sound limitations at the time don't do it justice unfortunately. Get that recording as well since it has historical significance.<BR>On to Reiner's performance...thrilling from beginning to end, while carefully balancing mussorgsky's ideas with ravel's impeccable orchestration (he was one of the best in music). Gnomus is particularly menacing, the old castle looming in veiled distance, cheeky unhatched chickens, an amazingly quixotic &quot;limoges,&quot; but what amazes me is baba yaga and the great gate of kiev, featuring the CSO's astounding brass section, led by principal trumpet &quot;bud&quot; herseth, who plays the solo with great aplomb. Imagine how many times he played that opening. All in all, a hair-raising experience that was so typical of Reiner's exacting direction (if sadistic). <BR>I can't say much about the other selections, though they are spectacularly played, esp. russlan and ludmilla which will knock the socks off of any listener worth his salt. \<BR>Do yourself a favor and get an absolutely priceless disc. may this never be deleted from the catalogue!
B000002U82|5.0|On the eve of the 30th anniversary edition of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" I thought I'd put on the headphones, give this disk a spin, and offer some thoughts on one of my favorite recordings.<br />Dark side is moody and atmospheric, full of texture and sounds to amplify all your senses. You have to listen to this on headphones for the full effect of the brilliantly used soundeffects. I like \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" but \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" will always have a special place for me.<br />There is so much concept in this disk that it's hard to pin down. The songs have a lot of beauty, but Roger Waters was always a cynic, so shadow tends to win out over light here, hence the title.<br />We begin with a birth of sorts, the building pulse of heartbeat, clocks, shuffling cash registers, voices and mad laughter that makes up \\"Speak to Me.\\"<br />\\"Breathe\\" has a great bass and drum beat, sliding guitars and keys lurking in the background. \\"Breathe, breathe in the air/don't be afraid to care/leave don't leave me/look around and choose your own ground.\\" At first the song is an affirmation of life, but then the rabbit forgetting the sun \\"and balanced on the biggest wave/you race towards an early grave.\\"<br />Next comes \\"On the Run\\" with its relentless key loops and high hat rhythm, and the impression of someone hurrying through a train station or airport. You're trying to get somewhere but you never arrive.<br />\\"Time\\" begins with a cacophony of alarm clocks pounding in your skull. Wake up! Time to go! Then we get into a very cool intro, with an outstanding drum performance by Nick Mason and haunting keyboards by Rick Wright, with added guitar texture by David Gilmour. The lyrical melody is a companion to \\"Breathe\\" and each song echoes similar themes. Great lyrics with \\"tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain/you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today/and then one day you find ten years have got behind you/no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.\\" Great guitar solo by David Gilmour, backing vocals and cool rhythms. The song drifts right in to the \\"Breathe Reprise\\" without pause, another reason this album is so great. It's seamless, moving from song to song with ease.<br />\\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" is Richard Wright's soaring keyboard based near-instrumental, featuring an incredible wordless vocal performance by Clare Torry. This one builds and recedes like waves. Very sensual.<br />\\"Money\\" is perhaps one of the more familiar Pink Floyd tunes, with a very cool bassline by Waters and excellent blend of instrumentation. The lyrics lampoon our pursuit of wealth.<br />\\"Us and Them\\" is another slow tempo tune where all of the instrumentation just works together so well, especially the gentle breathing saxophone by Dick Parry. The building dynamics of this tune are also very effective.<br />\\"Any Colour You Like\\" gets a bad rap as the weak piece of the disk, but it's a good bridge piece between Us and Them and the final medley. Plus, David Gilmour's guitar work is pretty cool with a multi-layered solo.<br />We arrive at \\"Brain Damage\\" only to discover that \\"the lunatic is in my head\\" and \\"you lock the door/and throw away the key/there's someone in my head but it's not me.\\" There's also the great couplet \\"the paper holds their folded faces to the floor/and every day the paper boy brings more.\\"<br />\\"Eclipse\\" brings us to the climax, but there's a trick to the lyrics here. Although the lyrics read \\"and everything under the sun is in tune/but the sun is eclipsed by the moon\\" this does not necessarily mean that all is cast in shadow. For, if \\"all that you love/all that you hate\\" and the other yin/yang couplets are to be eclipsed, then isn't there a form of double negative, reversing itself, and making shadow into light? Better listen to it again.<br />Buy this record, and if you want to try out an urban myth, put on \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and start this disk at the part where Dorothy emerges into the technicolor world of Oz. There is supposedly some uncanny parallel. Enjoy.r world of Oz. There is supposedly some uncanny parallel. Enjoy.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I first went to the movie Chicago and was absolutely blown away!Immediately after the film ended I went and bought the soundtrack.It is soo good. Thye best song I think is \\"Cell Block Tango\\" (not the INSPIRED version). all the original songs are great, but the different mixes of the song at the end of the C.D. pretty much suck! Iam gonna review all the songs on this disc. the scale is 1 to 5 and almost all are five. Here we go!<br />1. Overature/And All That Jazz(5 stars) I really like this song and Catherine Zeta Jones really shines in her part. I usually don't like instrumental, but this is GOOD instrumental.<br />2.Funny Honey (5 stars) I like this song and John C. Reily's monologue is awesome. I also dont know wht everyone's ripping on Ren'ee Zellweger's performance, she rocked.<br />3.When You're Good To Mama(5 stars) Queen Latifah did really well for being a rapper. I also like the lyrics and backround music to this song.<br />4.Cell Block Tango(5 stars) This my favorite track too bad Latifah,Kim, and Macy MURDER it later on in the C.D.

It doesn't really blow me away , but is STILL wonderful.<br />6.We Both Reached For The Gun(5 stars) I love the spoken lines in this song and the voice Richard Gere does is quite good. I love the scene they do in the movie for this!<br />7.Roxie(5 stars) This song is cool I think Renee Zellweger did great on this song ... .<br />8.I can't Do It  Alone(5 stars) I like this song and Jones does great, but The parts where it is just music are better in the movie where she dances.<br />9.Mister  Cellophane (4 stars) Although John C. Reily does a Fantastic performance, but the song is depressing and not as nearly as catchy.<br />10.Razzle Dazzle (5 stars) Richard Gere really stands out on this trackand sounds exactly like a 1920's performer. The scene in the movie is fairly well done.<br />11.Class (3 stars) This song is either supposed to be a joke or just stupid. They talk about having class but this song is definately not classy.<br />13.Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag(5 stars) I really like this song and it was a great ending for the film. It plays right before the credits.<br />14.I Move On (5 stars) I really like this song. It plays during the credits.<br />15.After Midnight(5 stars) If you got this C.d. for a themed party play this for the slow gone fast dance. Really good.

B00000G09Q|2.0|The turtles are at it again for the third time, but this movie isn't nearly as good as the first two, one of the reasons why is that Splinter's voice was awful, it seems to be that he was shaking and his voice was a little upbeat, also there are no foot soldiers or the Shredder, just a bunch of Japanese villians, and the idea of going back in time wasn't that great either, fortunatly we do get to see Casey Jones back even though he had only a minor role and Corey Feldman returns as the voice of Donatello (he didn't do the second one due to rehab for heroin addiction).<BR>Paige Turco returns as April O' Neal.<BR>The only reason why I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 cause it has Casey Jones in it but other than that, it's just not a great movie, only recommended for only the diehard turtle fans.
B000062Y98|5.0|My first introduction to this album was before it's release, when a freind gave me a link to the mp3 download of \\"Battlefield\\" off of century media's website. My first reaction was poor, thinking it disapointing for a Blind Guradian song. It seemed to noisy, incessantly busy. <br />After spending some time rotating on my play list, I began to like this song, even love it. What before seemed busy noise became incredibally progressive power metal in my mind, with a level of complexity never before reached by Blind Guardian.<br />The album, after I purchased it, proved to be much the same. The title (not just one of many sly references to other musicians, in this case queen) it apropos. A night at the opera indeed! If you close your eyes while listening you could almost see Hansi and company acting out the stories they sing, ranging from bible stories to the Trojan War.<br />Opening with the clashy (but not thrashy) Precious Jerusalem and ending with the incrediblaly epic And Then There Was Silence, the album does not let up for a minute. Gone are the sorrowfull dirges and anthems of Nightfall in Middle Earth, the growly gutteral Power Metal of Tales from the Twilight World and the bands earlier Power/Thrash hybrid. It seems that while sticking to Power Metal the band has switched secondary genres many times, from Trash to borderline Death to their more popular midevil sound to something so prog that it's almost hard to still label them as Power Metal. But hearing the soaring operettics and clashy choruses you realize that Blind Guardian, while realizing the potentialities of overlapping lyrics, backgorund choirs and incredibaly fast insturmentation, is still a Power Metal band at heart, heard in the intro to The Maiden and the Minstrel Night, to the many verses of And Then There Was Silence and the bands thematic aproach.<br />The album does not have any real slow parts, the band only taking momentary breaks from their musical barrage in the intro to The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight and some appropriately low key, but still rousing parts in And Then There Was Silence. Their old tricks still hold true when Hansi sings prancinly in Battlefield and Silence, his wails barraging you over complex layers of vocals.<br />And let us not forget the bonus track, or tracks as I should say, as depending on what country your disc comes from, you'll get a different track. They are all the same song, just sung in many different languages, the one I have, Mies Del Dolor is in spanish. After the exhausting run of this album, this mix of celtic and latin sounding guitar work over Hansi's passionate singing is just the perfect thing to unwind you and still rouse you at the end of this fine collection of songs.<br />My reccomendation to you is to buy this album, and listen to it many times, even if it rubs you the wrong way at first. As complexities become unwound in your mind, the beauty of Blind Guardian's A Night At The Opera is unveiled.
B00004ZB9D|3.0|In a way Lenny Kravitx is retro - on many songs you can hear that he wants a vintage sound. Personally I prefer the harder songs over the softer. If you (like me) think that Kravitz is alright but not great I believe a compilation like this one will do. You get to hear his best efforts in \\"Are you gonna go my way?\\", \\"American woman\\", \\"Mr. cab driver\\", and \\"Always on the run\\". The slower \\"It ain't over til it's over\\" is liked by a lot of people although I find it rather boring. And that's the main problem with Kravitz - the songs are not that exciting.<br />For me, this \\"Greatest hits\\" is enough, and if you're not a dedicated fan of Kravitz, I think you'll agree.

B00008BXJF|4.0|Una lstima si, porque podra haber sido el disco perfecto de King Crimson. En primer lugar reconocer que no tena demasiadas buenas expectativas ante esta nueva obra. Los precedentes del EP Happy with... y Level 5, no eran muy favorables. Pero he de decir que me ha sorprendido. La cancin Level 5, de ser una cancin que no me gustaba nada, ha pasado a convertirse en una de mis favoritas. El tratamiento de la percusin y la formalidad estructural que tiene la hacen un nuevo clsico. Solo tres canciones incluyen realmente letras y he de afirmar que son, con mucho, las peores. Eyes wide open podra salvarse aunque no ofrece nada que no haya sido dicho ya en otras baladas-medio tiempo de Belew. En cuanto a Happy with... es, prcticamente, la misma versin del EP, y eso, es decir muy poco. Sin duda, es una de las peores canciones de KC. Facts of Life es el tercer tema cantado y el peor lunar en el disco. Por qu?. En primer lugar porque es un tema heavy plano  de los que hay miles, pero, sobre todo, por su ubicacin en el disco. Es sabido que Fripp entiende sus obras como un todo. En este sentido, el ubicar esta pieza en medio de dos obras maestras como son Elektrik y Power to Believe es hacerle un flaco favor al disco.<BR>Si hacemos caso omiso de estas tres canciones, especialmente las dos ltimas, el resto del disco es FANTSTICO. Las cuatro partes de The Power to Believe son de lo mejor que he odo en mucho tiempo. Por que el disco no habr constado de TPTB 1-22?. En cuanto a los msicos. Mastelotto aporta cosas verdaderamente sorprendentes, especialmente en Level 5 y TPTB, Gunn est sobresaliente y Fripp en su papel. Solo Belew est muy por debajo de sus posibilidades. Realmente pienso, con ser un gran fan de Belew, que su papel en este cuarteto, est de ms. Sobran los temas cantados y sobra otro guitarrista. Su sustitucin por un autntico bajo y que Gunn se centrara en la warr guitar sera algo muy deseable.<BR>En fin, un gran disco que, por un par de temas, noes perfecto.
B00005RHGK|2.0|When I went to a sleepover with some of my 7th grade friends, they pulled this movie out of the DVD shelf and promised me it would be the \\"scariest thing I had ever seen in my life.\\" I was so excited to watch this movie in the beginning but the end was such a dissappointment. I never want to see it again. <br />The movie begins with two college students, a brother and sister, in a car driving down a desolate road in the middle of nowhere to visit their parents. After seeing no cars for hours, they are suprised to hear the beeping of a truck horn behind them. Looking out the rear view mirror, they see a rusty old truck with foggy, smudged windows swerving across the road. The driver tries to rear-end them, but they manage to escape just in time. The truck displays an eerie license plate. I personally think this was the scariest part of the movie, though it just went downhill from here. They come in contact with the truck later on as they see a shadowy cloaked figure in the backwoods of a church, dumping large canvas bags covered with blood into what looks like a sewer. They go back later to see what they are, and find a gorey, distgusting surprise in the basement of the church.<br />If you consider blood, gore, and disturbing images to be scary and absolutely fightening, then you'd better not watch this movie. I personally think all of those things take away from a movie that promises to be scary - I find them all gross! The ending is also something that will end up having you throwing this movie back onto a shelf and leaving it there forever. As my friends screamed in horror around me while watching \\"Jeepers Creepers,\\" I just sat on the bed in astonishment to how bad this movie was, I had to wonder, was this movie not scary, was I not easily frightened, or are my friends just the opposite of myself? I do not reccommend this DVD to anyone. It is a waste of time and money!
B00002Z88D|5.0|If your a Metallica fan then I promise you will love this CD. It's my favorite one of all. Their best songs are on it and the orchestra adds so much. I must of listened to it a hundred times when I first bought it. I personally enjoy thier live albums more then thier studio one's, and this is probably thier best live recording ever.
B00007LL7O|2.0|I know a lot of folks are praising this record, but I beg to differ. I don't know what happened. This is almost easy listening compared even to the &quot;lightest&quot; of their previous CDs. The songs are quite boring for the most part, the only highlights being &quot;Eagleheart&quot; and moments of &quot;Fantasia&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Stratofortress&quot; (albeit Tolkki is still an amazing guitarist). Perhaps a solo career is best for the members from now on? They still have some killer music see &quot;Episode&quot;, &quot;Visions&quot; and &quot;Infinite&quot; but this is lacking... if this album is any inclination then they must step aside and concede the throne to the True Metallers Rhapsody, Kamelot and Lost Horizon.
B00006IUL7|4.0|It is a nice follow-up installment after the unique psychological thriller - Memento. Chris Nolan can surely saved his seat in the mainstream with this good work and we do need this talent out of the at-times boring industry.<br />But in my opinion, it could still be more better. Chris Nolan should shed more lights on the impact of suffering from insomnia that affected Will Domer as in Memento did to Leonard Shelby's amnesia. In addition, the ending sequence could extend longer and look at the intensity between the three characters, whereby will be more satisfying. <br />ANY GOOD?<BR>The chase cross the river is the best moment of the film, nicely crafted and shooted.<BR>Robin Williams' soft acting earns him 5stars.<BR>Al Pacino's sleepy eyes are absorbing, u can definitely feel his tiredness.

B00000117E|4.0|Red hot guitar rock right up there with some of the finest recordings from the genre giants such as Cream or The Yardbirds. When rock was rockin' and the working class lads had a chance of getting out of the slum. A guitar was heckuwa better than construction work in Sydney, the docks of Liverpool or Sheffield steel. In those golden times even Pittsburg Steelers still played at the famed Three Rivers Stadium! Seriously, this is one rip roarin album. Get yaself a pint and don your greens 'cause Rory rocks!

I don't know about the quality of the original sound mixing...that could be the culpret--but at the very least the sound mastering of this DVD in non-existant.   It is impossible to enjoy this film in this format.  Each scene requires you to reset the volume.  It is completely unacceptable.
0316666343|4.0|I found this book on the SF Chronicle's Best of 2002 list. It sounded interesting and it sure made the cut. Great idea for this book. Engaging story. It really makes you think. To sum up my vague review I will just say one thing: Read it.
B000021XR5|5.0|No. 4.  All I have say is wow.  I've always loved Stone Temple Pilots since I first heard their stuff comin' from my bro's open bedroom door, and this is no exception.  First I gotta say, is that if anything could've saved rock and roll from the \\"alternative/emo/poppunk takeover\\" it was this album.  It starts out with a rockin start at \\"Down\\" which has a simple but memorable riff and goes through \\"Heaven and Hot Rods\\" which is just simply no B.S. rock.  This song and MC5 are the stuff you blast when ur mad.  I dont know why but \\"Pruno\\" and \\"Church on Tuesday\\" remind me of Wicked Garden and Tumble and the rough.  \\"Sour Girl\\" has an awesome feel and \\"No way out\\" is an excellent song to scream to.  It goes on to \\"Sex and Violence\\" which's got a nice mix of ambient sounds and blastin rock.  Through \\"Glide\\" whichs got one of the coolest endings of any of STP's songs.  \\"I Got You\\" shows that STP ain't afraid to do what they want to do and I think leads towards their more exploratory realm in Shangri.  After MC5 ya got \\"Atlanta\\" which's got some real indepth feeling in the lyrics, unlike some of scott's previous works.  ...
0451167716|3.0|I'm mystified by all the reviewers who insist this book is \\"way better than the movie\\" and indiscriminately slap 5-stars on it. They're misguided. Don't believe them.<br />Sure, The Godfather is a page-turner...I've read it a few times and you can always count on it to suck you in like a Hoover. BUT C'MON! It's full of trashy sex scenes and lazy language. Puzo himself dissed the book, and freely admitted that he wrote a ... formulaic book strictly designed to make money. Francis Ford Coppola's movie axed out all the pulpy aspects, and transformed a cheesy best-seller into a powerful piece of art. A key example of how the movie script blows the novel away:<br />In the book's opening chapters, the narrator states that Don Corleone has always intended to make Michael his successor. Oops...<br />...there goes the suspense! Puzo ruins the crucial character arc--Michael's slow conversion from \\"nice college boy\\" to \\"ruthless don-in-training\\"--with this one line. In the film, on the other hand, no one views Michael as a successor. It's understood that he shuns the family business. As he's drawn in, it's his resistance, his denials, and his ultimate capitulation that keep us watching.<br />Book botches this; film handles it expertly. Just one of many examples. By all means, read the book, but maintain a little perspective. It's no masterpiece.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence comes out with their new album, Fallen today. Initially, I had doubts, but every doubt was shut down. I was blown away with masterpieces like Tourniquet and My Last Breathe. Every song on here is top of the line. Amy Lee's stunning vocals are of those to be desired. Pick this up if you can. I am TELLING you to get your butt off the couch, put down the Doritos and Pepsi, and RUN to your store(Circuit City has it cheaper than amazon, haha) and buy this album! A must! 5 Stars out of 5!<br />EvBoard ROCKS!
0375414053|5.0|I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT is a hillarious, must-read book for women of all ages, married or single. I related to all of it, even though I'm single. And I felt like I was listening to my married friends sharing their stories of juggling the kids and work and shouldering the burdens of domestic responsibilities while their significant others sail through life without a clue! The office dynamics between men and women in the workplace are so on targeet too! If Allison Pearson wasn't so funny, you might cry at the inequities Kate Reddy suffers both at home and in the workplace because they are all too real.<br />I'm keeping this review short and sweet since I read the book in 3 days 3 months ago. Suffice it to say that if you liked Bridget Jones Diary (and how could you not?), or The Nanny Diaries, you will love this book. Your health will improve too, and general state of mind because you can't help reading it without laughing out loud.
6300216268|5.0|I saw this film when it was new, and each time I watch it, I feel renewed.  Bud Cort, the bored rich kid who cannot find anyone or anything in life to relate to, meets a woman who's eccentricity surpasses anything weird Harold ever did, only she plays with life, where Harold plays with death.  They meet at a stranger's funeral and Harold's fascination with Maude with her unabashed lust for life slowly learns how to live.  She shows him things to be heard, touched, seen, tasted, smelled, and explored ... she engages every ounce of her being in LIFE.  Her famous \\"Gimme an 'L'\\" speech is still a wonderful motivator.  This film is guaranteed to open your eyes to the world we live in, and inspire you to take ahold of it.
0312305060|4.0|I picked this up after seeing the film and loving it - a habit I generally try to avoid because the larger-than-life allure of the cinema tends to flood the perceptions and overwhelm anything that can be constructed on the page. This proved to be the case when I sat down with the \\"The Hours\\" - in my mind, Meryl Streep was inevitably Clarissa, Nicole and Her Nose were inevitably Virginia - but the novel has its own charms which can't be entirely translated into a film - or at least not in quite the same way.<BR>I<BR> approached this novel afraid it was going to be \\"literary\\" in the worst sense - earnest, self-conscious, in love with its own linguistic virtuosity, and sprinkled with exquisite faux profundities throughout. Actually, \\"The Hours\\" is almost guilty of all these charges - while reading it, I was thinking, \\"Oooh, you're treading a tightrope there, buddy, don't stumble, don't embarrass yourself, don't get sentimental...Hey, that's it! That's beautiful! Phew\\" - but somehow it redeems itself. <BR>I had these prejudices because of the film, which, like the book, teeters precariously on the brink of being maudlin and pretentious, a weepy for middle-aged women with vague literary notions - but, again, somehow redeems itself through the sheer beauty of the cinematography and the subtlety and earthiness of the three starring actresses. <br />The Hours\\" is only occasionally weighed down with the kind of affectations and self-consciousness that occasionally renders Woolf's work difficult; mostly, it's a generous, readable, quietly witty and genuinely insightful book that actually deserves the hyperbolic praise so liberally tossed around by critics. (The prose IS actually kind of \\"luminous\\" and \\"exquisite\\" and \\"multi-layered\\", from time to time, believe it or not.) Don't be intimidated; you can read this one in a lovely, reflective afternoon.
B000066C1N|5.0|I have watched this movie and listened to some of the songs off the soundtrack. I think it is great.  These songs are excellant songs.  Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer did a wonderful job writing and producing these songs.  They really fit in with the movie too.

B000089RVX|5.0|hello..<BR>  i was introduced to evanescence last year, never knowing what would be the outcome of their fabulous work.  before this band, i'd never learned the true meaning of being in love with music, and feeling it deep down in your soul.  evanescence is the most talented band i have ever met and had the priviledge of knowing and hearing.... and now that they are finally getting this recognition, they deserve every bit of positive feedback they get coming their way.  unlike many bands, amy, ben, john, rocky, and will (and anyone else they've worked with) are in this to make music, and to touch the heart... not for dollars in their pockets, or for other shallow reasons.  this cd, along with their other work is absolutely beautiful.. and regardless of how much support they get from others, they are still number one in my heart no matter what.  go out and get this cd, and anything else you can get your hands on.. because this is truly a once in a lifetime sound, and a once in a lifetime band making it.
B00008BXJF|5.0|to review this terrific disc.  Though it was released today in the US, I actually got it last week (I'm in Europe).  <BR>I like this much more than Thrak or ConstruKction of Light.  Those discs had quite a bit of cheese on them (Dinosaur?  Prozac Blues?) but this new disc doesn't mess around.  It is more focused.  Sounding at times like the past (Beat, Starless and Bible Black) and at times like the future (?!), and at times like various ProjeKcts.  Highlights for me are Eyes Wide Open (reminds me of One Time but where that song could have been written by Sting, this one is more twisted harmonically and could only have come from Belew's pen), and ElectriK (reminds me an awful lot of Fracture).  Tons of monstrous polyrythmic guitar riffing and blistering rythm section throughout.  Whereas Bruford and Levin were missed on the previous album, here I didn't doubt Gunn and Mastelotto for a second.  And are there any other guys pushing 60 that can rock with as much vitality as Fripp?
B00000K19E|5.0|I'm a fan of all types of movies, and coming up with a top 10 list is a challenge for anyone... but #1 is a no-brainer: The Matrix. This movie is full of eye candy, drama, action, great acting, comedy, and thrills. It's a non-stop rollercoaster that you'll want to watch over and over. The DVD has some great features that you can watch directly from the special features menu, or indivudually as they appear during the movie. The featurette on how they filmed the sweeping 360 degree slow motion scenes is fascinating.<br />I don't buy many movies, as I don't typically like to watch the same film more than once or twice. This film in a rare exception, and it is the type of movie that you can pop in the DVD player and lose yourself in the story while running for 30 minutes on the treadmill. The only problem is pulling yourself away from the action to get back to your normal life.<br />If you are a fan of Star Wars, Stargate, Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, or any modern sci fi action movie, you need to add The Matrix to your permanent collection. You'll love it.
B000002GAF|5.0|I bought this cassette in the 70's.  I just pulled it out, and went back in time listening to it.  It still sounds as great as it did almost 30 years ago.  Don't miss this one.
B000002LCD|3.0|Like the film it came from, Who's That Girl is a so-so project. The Madonna songs are fine, and of course who would buy it for the other artists? It has three fine Madonna songs (&quot;Can't Stop&quot; is not one of them). The best would have to be &quot;Causing A Commotion&quot;, which surprisingly is sort of underrated compared to heavy weights like &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Take A Bow&quot;. &quot;Who's That Girl&quot; is another great Madonna song-again, under appreciated. The biggest surprise I found was in &quot;The Look Of Love&quot;-its so dark and Depeche Mode-like and is one of Madonna's best electronic songs. Who's That Girl holds three songs that are great but just have never made a huge impact. It is worth buying for these songs. Ignore the movie, ignore that horrible album cover, and you'll be fine.
B00005JK8K|1.0|And then i suddenly i got the point! The nu-breed of Hollywood war films is based on the following recipe:<BR>    make the film look a playstation game where the \\"bad\\" guys (may they be Japanese, Arabs, Germans, whichever) jump appropriately around so they can be shot up, while the good guys advance to the next stage and have extra weapons too. Nice, real nice.<BR>    In this hilariously horrible film, John Woo shows us what he thinks of ridiculing history. Hey, there's no problem really of treating even a WWII massacre like that in the Japanese islands like his Mission Impossible flick. Is there? <BR>    There's also no problem with having Nicholas Cage act like Rambo either, no? Besides, if Cage himself doesnt mind playing in embarrasing films like that it's not Woo's fault, right?<BR>   But mr.Woo thinks that as long as he shows us loadsa gore, heads flying off, arms being shot to bits and the all the rest of it, he's gonna get the audiences flocking da theaters. Think again mr.Woo.<BR>    The digital planes bombing the bejeesus off the \\"Japs\\" are so obvious they reminded me the glory days of the Japanese version of the cardboard Godzilla. As did the fake explosions, in fact I've seen explosions in playstation games looking more realistic than those in the film.<BR>    The worst part? Forget the fact that dialogues are an insult to the very word \\"dialogue\\". Forget the fact that the characters themselves are pathetic caricatures seen only in D-movie disasters. Forget the fact that as history itself is concerned this film is as distanced from it as it could possibly be. But, man, couldn't mr.Woo at least have picked another instance from WWII history , one that at least did NOT involve the Navajo indians?????? Why insult them like that by putting lines in the Navajo character's mouth like: \\"I want to go to war to fight for my country\\"???? Uhm, werent the Navajos practically expterminated OFF their own country by those very people they supposedly would love to \\"fight for\\" in the film?<BR>    Mere details some will say. Of course. This is Hollywood, so no problemos if we insult this or the other ethnic group or tribe in the name of entertainment.<BR>     One of the worst films I've seen in a long time...
B00005J6T1|5.0|Sometimes less is more. That's true in the case of Madonna, when she released her debut album in 1983. Its simple declarations of love and heartache laid the foundation for a rich body of work that would exceed anyone's expectations. This is the way pop should sound like: carefully structured hooks, irresistible rhythyms, and a commanding prescense (we had no idea, did we?). While Like A Prayer is clearly her best work, Madonna is where the story begins. There is something stirring within the record, hidden in the triumphant \\"Holiday\\" or the down and dirty \\"Burning Up\\". The Madonna that would follow would become an idol, one that took risks, poured her guts out, and constantly tried to redefine her signature dance sound that starts at this point. Some of Madonna's catchiest numbers are here, and while its not the thought provoking confessions that would soon follow, its enough to shoot down the idea that pop is a throw away genre. Look at what Madonna has done for music and video and what she is working on as we sleep at night. Expect to hear more from her, and listen to chapter one of this intriguing saga.
B000089RVX|5.0|Exciting, Uplifting, Emotional...all words that only begin to explain the music of Evanescence. Using &quot;dark&quot; rock as the sense of the music, the band offers view of your inner self and the world around you. Every single verse means something else to differnt people, making it the most memoriable bands on earth. Although their name means &quot;A dissapearance like vapor&quot;, these guys will last forever. Even though their music can be compared to many bands, no one can compare to the compassion and emotion of Amy Lee's vocals. Ben Moody and Amy Lee wrote most of the songs themselves, even as early as junior high school! This is the new face of talent. You cant go wrong with this band.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I have listened to this CD everyday from the past 10 months. And this is the only music I listen to. The music is refreshing and smooth. You will never get tired of this CD. Every song is good and her voice is beautiful. For anyone who wants to listen to more of her songs, check her webiste norahjones.com You can download mp3 songs and they are all free. Also check out her new DVD. You will love her live concert.
B000084T18|5.0|This is the best cd I have heard in soooo long. Ive been listening to 50 since 1998 and his rhymes are insane...now he's got DRE to produce his beats and he makes the best cd of the year. Buy this cd its crazy.
1565117794|5.0|Without a doubt &quot;The Life of Pi&quot; is the best book I have read to date.  So many times through out this book I felt as though I was Pi. The story telling was so intense that I could feel what Pi was feeling.  There were times I thought I could actually reach out and touch Richard Parker.  I can not say enough good things about this novel... BUT... I would not recommend reading the foreword by the author.  He comes across as pretensious and conceited and it may turn you off of the book.
0316666343|5.0|When I first started reading this book, it was difficult to place myself in the position of viewing the continuance of life from Susie's heaven.  I couldn't imagine this story line holding my attention for very long.  However, with every new chapter was a new character with a different plot making me want to read further to find the ending.<br />Susie Salmon is a 14-year-old who finds that her life has violently and brutally been taken away from her by  her neighbor, Mr. Harvey.  Susie is now in the position of looking down from heaven and watching what used to be her life continue without her.  She finds out that she is not the first one of Mr. Harvey's victims and meets some of the others while in heaven.<br />Susie finds out what heaven is all about and even makes friends while there.  She has the help of Franny, a sort of counselor to help with her journey there.<br />Her family is in denial that she is dead and holds onto any shred of hope that they will find her alive.  When her family finally realizes that she is not coming home, Susie sees her family falling apart.  Her father is obsessed with trying to find her killer, sure that he knows that it is Mr. Harvey, yet unable to find the evidence to convict him.  Her mother cannot deal with the loss and eventually leaves the family to cope with it in her own way.  Her brother is trying to cope with losing both his sister and his mother.  The younger sister is trying to keep the family together as best she can.  As she watches her sister and her best friend, Ruth, grow to womanhood she realizes that she will never have the experiences that they are having.<br />With the help of her sister, Lindsey, evidence to convict Mr. Harvey has been found, but too late.  Mr. Harvey has disappeared and cannot be found.  However, he is closer than anyone expects.<br />Susie does get to come back to earth for a short time occupying Ruth's body and is able to fulfill a dream and that was for a final kiss from her boyfriend, RaySingh.  With the first kiss, Ray knows it is Susie.  Susie finds that it is harder to leave those she loves the second time around.<br />This book will have you crying, laughing, angry, scared and hoping for revenge against her perpetrator.  Payback does happen, but not as you would hope or expect to happen.  There is some truth to the old saying &quot;what goes around comes around.&quot;<br />I wonder if this imagery of Susie being dead, yet still an active part of the story isn't a metaphore for our sense of how we are sometimes seeing the world from two different perspectives.  Sometimes when you see the world, you are living in it yet seeing it from a self-reflective distance.  I think this novel could be interpreted as a metaphor for this kind of experience.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Along with The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, this is by far the best picture of the year. There is no way you can be bored when viewing this movie, unless your already dead that is. Don't listen to the negative reviews bashing this movie. Go see it for yourself and then you will realize why this film is nominated for 13 Oscars.
B00005MP58|4.0|I agree that this is an outstanding adaptation that you will someday want to own and watch repeatedly, but maybe not in its current transfer to DVD, for the audio mix is topsy turvy. Which is to say, the background music is mixed up too high in some of the scenes (especially at the balls), making the dialogue a little bit hard to understand for those of us who may have attended one too many Rolling Stones concerts. <br />The bad mix wouldn't be an issue except that there are no subtitles provided with this edition. I'm surprised to discover that A&amp;E and the English media companies aren't sensible enough to routinely supply subtitles for their cache of chickflic gems (Brideshead Revisited doesn't have them either) so that those of us in the Estados Unidos can make sense of that special brand of the King's English spoken on the emerald isle.
0446677450|5.0|I just got done reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad -- and I was very excited to read the new perspectives that Kiyosaki brings to the table.  I've read just about every success book out there, and I'm not really looking for someone to tell me exactly what to do (Like how Tony Robbins tells you to eat only fruit until 1pm every day! haha)...  So I was refreshed by the concepts he offers.  Especially the concept of seperating your assets from your liabilities, and recognizing liabilities that you may think are assets.  I look forward to reading more of his info, and maybe seeing him in a seminar in the future.<br />As with all success books, however, the author is not god -- and yes it is probably true that there is no &quot;Rich Dad&quot;, and that Kiyosaki made his millions from selling these books and nothing else.  That's ok with me, but I just wanted to point that out to others who might read and then take everything he gives you at face value, instead of thinking about it more deeply.
B000002AHM|5.0|This album records three artists &quot;speaking&quot; guitar. For this, it is amazing. It is a live concert, so don't expect your 3-minute songs with recognizable melody. It is an awesome jam-sesson. Listening to this album is like listening in on a conversation in a beautiful language different from your own --where you can pick out phrases and appreciate the rhythms and intonations.  Because we are all familiar with guitar music, it is much better than that may sound. If you want to hear masters communicating in real-time in a medium that is truly their own, buy this album.  Also, the sound quality is amazing on the HDCD version.<BR>   If I were to compare it to the 1964 Getz, Gilberto, Jobim album (Girl From Ipanema, etc.) the key differences are:<BR>- you will not come away humming any tunes; <BR>- the form in this(Friday Night....) is much freer, much like <BR>  a conversation;<BR>- This is a brighter sounding album -the guitars are sharp and<BR>  played intensely.<br />Nevertheless, you will still want to listen to each again.
B000084T18|5.0|There isnt a better album out there that ive heard.  50 Cent has some tight beats with great songs.  Eminem appears on 2 tracks and those are his tightest tracks.  If you think that mtv is just playin him out, hear the other tracks.  The songs they dont play over the air are his best!
B000002I25|5.0|Certainly, there is no underestimating the potential of this album to, in the words of Jim Morrison, \\"do something good to your head.\\"  The Doors are the merging of theater and the rebellion of late 60's rock and roll.  Like many great bands of this era, the Doors were founded upon a strong blues base and radicalized by life as part of the counter-culture and experimentation with drugs and alcohol.  The Doors set themselves apart by blending subtle musical stylings with the fiery poetic musings of their charismatic front man.  This album is filled with cosmopolitan drug-induced imagery, sexual hunger and the dangerous mysticism of prying the \\"doors of perception\\" open (see Break on Through and the End).  \\"Soul Kitchen\\" and \\"Back Door Man\\" exhibit the Doors' blues background with swagger and energy while Bertold Brecht and Kurt Weill's \\"Alabama Song\\" is a dark, bohemian anthem.  \\"Light My Fire\\" is the classic organ-driven ode to hedonism and \\"the End\\" is the late 60's rock n roll version of an ancient Homeric epic.  Yes, the Doors are merely a rock  roll band, but they are one of the most creative of all time.  Don't feel guilty for buying this album for \\"the hits,\\" but take the time to listen to the rest and the End.
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is so great. I heard about Evanescence from a friend in Little Rock about last Christmas and Ive been waiting for the cd for a while. My favorite track is definatly Imaginary but the entire cd is great to blast in the car and the lyrics are just amazing. I hope to see much more from them in the future.
6302787300|1.0|This movie is an awful misrepresentation of the truth.  Columbus was not a peace loving advocate of the \\"indians.\\"  He and his men were responsible for rape, death, and enslavement.  Hundreds of thousands of natives died! Our history textbooks are filled with lies and dangerous films like these simply continue ignorance.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've known about Evanescence for about 3 years, and it was obvious that it was just a matter of time before they absolutely exploded onto the scene.  I'm VERY pumped that the nation and whoever else will finally be able to share in the incredible talent of Evanescence.  Needless to say, I predict big things for this album.  Amy Lee has one of my three favorite voices in history.  And believe you me, I've heard a lot of voices.  Ben Moody is a genius.  Not to mention the deep, meaningful, and Truthful lyrics.  Yeah, you couldn't get a stronger recommendation from a person than the one you're currently getting from me.  If you enjoy what we call &quot;music&quot;, then go now and get this CD.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I was privileged to be at both the Meltdown concert and two nights during Dave's three night stint at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Dave did this gig because he enjoyed the informality of the Meltdown concert at the Festival Hall the previous year. It could not and was not intended to replicate the Pink Floyd Earls Court Concerts and I can see how some were taken aback by his choice of music. It was a very emotional event and the audience just wanted more and more of the same.<BR>For me Rick Wright and the bands performance of Breakthrough was a real treat. Dave's rendering of Richard Thompsons Dimming of the day is beautiful. Please see this concert not as a Pink Floyd concert but as a very talented David Gilmour having a great time with his friends and enjoying every minute of it as we all did.
0671510991|3.0|Kissinger almost tries to be poetic in the way that her writes, but as I read it, it became painfully clear that English is not his first language. While it provides a good political analysis, I feel as though Kissinger over complicates his statements. He rambles on for pages on an analysis that could be summed up in a paragraph. Kissinger is a very intelligent man, that much is obvious, but &quot;Diplomacy&quot; simply runs on and on and is overly redundant.

0321127420|5.0|This book is an enjoyable and well writen book about IT.  Fowler's offers candid expression of the limitations of the ideas, and the nature of the development world.  This book also gives a perspective on some of the important architectural issues in enterprise applications.  Fun to read and valuable, this book deserves 5 stars.<br />Can it lift architectures of enterprise applications to a higher level of abstraction, well maybe not.<br />I *got* the GOF &quot;Design Patterns&quot; book after a lecture from Richard Helm.  I realized that simply identifying structures that frequently exist, can help to organize complexity, so my thinking could move to a higher level of abstraction.<br />Since then patterns have typically made development much more complex.  We could be simply naming the patterns that are necessary to implement a function.  But this is not happening, architects instead follow this advice from the book &quot;Core J2EE Patterns&quot;:   &quot;using this pattern or its strategies results in only a small amount of additional upfront work and provides considerable benefits.&quot; <br />So every conceivable pattern gets stuffed into applications creating an unbelievably complex &quot;best practice&quot; system.<br />At least you would hope that given the small number of patterns in GOF, and its acceptance as a standard, that people would use the names faithfully.  This does not happen, the architects I work with more commonly misuse the pattern names, than use them correctly.  Fowler's book is less accepted and has more patterns so I assume it will be worse, so in two year time no one will know what I mean when I say &quot;Transaction Script&quot;.  So this work will not enable us to communicate better.<br />This book is not as timeless, or academically correct as &quot;Design Patterns&quot;.  The editing is somewhat inconsistent.  The explanations are less precise and formal but easier to understand.<br />If you read this book you will be able to think more clearly about structures in your systems.  You will understand this book if it applies to the systems you are building.  This book is good to read and related to what I do.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The majority of this CD is as energetic and fabulous as the film.  The mix of dialogue over song (for instance in &quot;Funny Honey&quot;) truly takes the listener right back to the theater.  I thoroughly enjoy this CD until &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; (the remix) and &quot;Love is a Crime&quot; start to play...not a rare opinion, from what I've read.  In any case, I can't hit the skip-track button fast enough when these songs begin.  They are both out-of-place, pointless mood-breakers in this girl's opinion.  It is very fortunate that they are at the end of the CD and can be easily skipped.  Don't let them turn you off!  With stellar performances by Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, Gere, Latifah, and others, this is one disc that'll have you happily humming the melodies as you go through your busy day.  Excellent fun.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|This story is about a teenage boy named &quot;Jamal Wallace&quot; ,and about a man named &quot;William Forrester&quot;.Jamal robbed William. What Jamal didnt know was he was robbing a famous writer who is agorophobic. Jamal left his back pack at his house that night he robbed him and came back to get it and William ordered him to write a 5,000 page essay on why he robbed him.Then after he wrote that essay they started talking and William helped Jamal in his english and Jamal was accepted to this very &quot;smart&quot; school . You have to watch to find out what happened to Jamal and William. I think this movie was excellent and i recomend this movie to every one.Its not a boring movie.Sean Connery playing William Forrester is telling Rob brown playing Jamal Wallace to try things, aim high , be all you can be. Although he is not telling him with words he is showing him the way .Rob Brown playing Jamal Wallace was his first movie to ever play in. I think &quot;Jamal Wallace&quot; was a great influance to &quot;William Forrester&quot; and the other way around because they both helped one another out in life.
B000075BFK|4.0|Although Tupac has been dead for six years, he has still been coming out with hot joints such as Thugz Mansion, and Still Ballin'.  One of the best traks on the joint is Fair Xchange, and its remix.  Here Pac calls out all the women that he gives pleasure, but they never give back.  The greatest thing about Tupac is that his rhymes don't deal with the same old rapper rutine.  They deal with what seems to be his real life situations.  Rappers aren't rappers unless they are poets, because to be a true rapper u need to be poetic and fluent in ur rythem.  Tupac is the only successful rapper to release a decent poetry book.  This album is off the hook, and i'd say that it's almost comparable to his hit album &quot;all eyes on me&quot;  I think it's great that an MC like Tupac can get recognition like this without all that comercialized junk.  I just hope that they don't do that and make him to be out like Michael Jordan, old and overplayed.
B000002GJ7|5.0|Why is Extreme so underrated?  Well, it's kind of a toss-up.  First off, their two biggest hits were the accoustic-driven love ballads &quot;More Than Words&quot; and &quot;Hole Hearted&quot;.  Now there's nothing wrong with a good love song, but this may be one major reason as to why the band was (and still are) overlooked geniuses.  I suppose they were dismissed as a pop act...<br />Secondly, right about the time this album was released, there was a storm brewing in Seattle, Washington.  That's right, the grunge scene came out of nowhere and took the nation by storm.  Dirty jeans and stringy hair repalced the bandannas and mousse-abuse.  The ever-fickle masses embraced the lyrics of alienation and getting obliterated.  Next thing you know, Everyone's wanting to deny the fact that they ever listened to &quot;glam-rock&quot; and are wanting to grow up and be the next Cobain.  <br />Well, that's a shame.  Extreme's timing may have been a little off, but you'd never know it from the sound of this album.  No, this is not some little Poison-clone, or Motley Crue soundalike, these guys were honest-to-God musicians and Pornograffiti is proof of that which has stood up ever-so-well over the years.  Yeah they may have had a softer look, but that was just the time.  When you hear the rock-solid musicianship on this cd, I think that you'll agree.  It holds a certain energy and magic, that I believe is STILL unmatched to this day.  <br />While I love the follow-up, &quot;III Sides To Every Story&quot;, I'll still have to put this one ahead.  It has everything you could want from a hard rock album.  If you're still not convinced, I challenge you to go out and get a copy.  Let the music do the talking.  You can't lose.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I loved this score, even more than the first one. I found the Fellowship's score alright but mediocre, to tell the truth. But this one is spectacular, if only because it has what I love in a soundtrack.... great battle music and great sad tunes, something I feel the Fellowship's soundtrack was lacking.<br />Track 19, Gollum's Song, pretty much makes the whole CD worth buying, if not for just the first 1:15 of the track (which is the main Gollum theme before the added lyrics and harmonizing later in the track). This is the kind of gothic music that I've been waiting on for a long time, something I've expected Danny Elfman to deliver but hasn't in his latest scores.
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is probably the best movie that i have ever seen. Whether its the directorial genious of David Fincher or the great performances turned in by all the cast members it is an all around excellent movie. The general plotline (without giving too much away) is about a serial killer who kills his victims because they simplify the seven deadly sins. While it can be a pretty gruesome movie at times it is something that everyone should see. David Fincher gets overlooked quite a bit but if you've gotten a chance to see such movies as The Game, Fight Club, or Panic Room and liked them I can almost guarantee you that you will be a fan of this movie.  Its a movie that deserves more recognition than what it gets made by a director who gets hardly any recognition. If you've never heard of David Fincher please see his movies. Just look him up online and find out what he has made.  He has only made a total of four movies so far (five, if you include Alien 3 which he has pretty much disowned because of the studio not giving him enough freedom with it) but all four of the movies are awesome in their own way.
B000089RVX|4.0|I was lucky enough to have access to this cd before it was released. Although some mght say they are a little generic due to the fact their singer is female I thought it was excellent...kind of reminds me of KIDNEYTHEIVES and maybe a bit of TAPPING THE VEIN both group with excellent female vocals.which is my weakness.<BR>Buy this cd enjoy it and embrace change

B000089RVX|5.0|Excellent first CD for this new group. Lead singer Amy Lee's vocals are chilling, emotional, and powerful-- I've never heard anything like it. If you are a fan of hard rock or even more of a soft rock fan, you will enjoy this album. Just give it a listen, the music speaks for itself. This band is headed to the top if they continue to grow.
0380778556|5.0|I first read this book in high school, and love it as much -- if not even more -- 25 years later. The sense of place in this novel is very strong, and the narration lends itself to vivid imagery. Add to that a set of multi-dimenstional characters and a suspenseful plot with unexpected twists, you have a timeless classic.<br />In most book stores, this title is typically shelved in the Fiction/Literature sections, not Romance.<br />--Paula Fitzsimmons, pjpublications.com
6305428298|4.0|LITTLE VOICE.  There is some really great talent in this film.  Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge, Iris) and Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge, Star Wars, Black Hawk Down etc) especially.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Definately an excellent CD.  The sound is full like the original recordings.  An excellent addition to any Elvis collection. Also the bonus track, &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; great.  I have the original version, both are great. This CD is definately  a must have.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Great cd to sit and relax to.  Norah Jones' voice is so refreshing compared to all of the semi talented singers out there today.
B000002BHE|5.0|Falling Into You is my favorite album by Mrs. Celine Dion!!!! She is the best singer, with the best voice. If you wanna know what the songs are like read the previews below:<br />1. It's all coming back to me now - This song is 7 minutes long! It's a long song, but Celine shows off her vocals here.<br />2. Because you loved me - I so love this song, it's a beautiful ballad!<br />3. Falling into you - A romantic song!<br />4. Make you happy - A poppish song, it sounds pretty good. I like it!<br />5. Seduces me - A sexy romantic song, sung by Celine.<br />6. All by myself - I love this song! It's really good.<br />7. Declaration of love - This song is cool!<br />8. Dreamin' of you - One of my favorite songs on here, i love the background music to it and Celine's voice fits it well.<br />9. I love you - A wonderful song!<br />10. If that's what it takes - The english version of Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore, i like both versions! <br />11. I don't know - This is also the english version of Je Sais Pas, i like both versions!<br />12. River Deep, Mountain High - This was Tina Turner's song but Celine re-did it her way, I like Celine's way!<br />13. Your light - I love this song! It's another one of my favorites. It's only on canadian versions though, sry.<br />14. Call the man - This song is a good ballad. Nice! I used to not like it along time ago when I first heard it on the computer. But now I love it!<br />15. Fly - A sad song about Celine's niece Karine who died from Cystic Fibrosis in 1993. <br />As you can see this CD totally rocks! I have had this CD burned  for me by another Celine friend online, and she had the canadian version so thats how I got your light on mine! :) Anyways, I suggest you BUY this CD right away, don't wait! Celine you rock girl!<BR>PS. Any song by Celine is worth listening to!!
B000070WJE|4.0|Anyone who has been following his carrier will agree that Robbie is probably one of the most talented artist of this generation. In addition to great music his take on life's every little aspect is so direct, amusing and refreshing it will blow you away. The song Millennium from his first album \\"Ego has landed\\" was the one that caught my attention first. Since then I have bought all of his albums and I seldom listen to anything else. His second album \\"Sing when you are winning\\" in my opinion is one of the best albums ever recorded. <BR>When his latest became available for sale I immediately ordered it, regardless of the ridiculous price tag at the time (it's much better now). And I was not disappointed at all. This is the most diverse and original collection of songs you'll ever find on a CD. No matter what you like, there's something for everyone. Style changes from one track to the next and as always he staid true to his unique stile of songwriting. All the songs on this album are good, but some are just great. Second song on this album \\"Feel\\" is one of the best songs I've ever heard (and from what I understand it will be the first single as well). \\"I've got too much life running through my veins, going to waste\\" pretty much sums up perception of him. <BR>One thing that surprises me is how oblivious this country (US) has stayed to his work. I guess die-hard fans of NSYNC and Brittany have gotten a little too tone-deaf from screeching sounds. Lets hope this album will get the acceptance and appreciation it deserves.
630503723X|1.0|If you're looking for the true erotic masterpiece that people talked to you about or the one you saw somewhere and dying to have in your collection STAY AWAY FROM THIS VERSION!!! This one is cut! And most disturbingly, the actual scenes for which you buy this film are missing!! Forget about it, go find yourself another movie...
B00004TRD8|5.0|This movie is the best DVD I have ever own and also the best movie that I have ever seen.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I enjoyed the first song a lot!  The cd is a great choice when you want something peaceful to listen to...her voice is very mellow. Some songs I did skip through because they were a little boring.  I was looking for a little more variety in the songs.  However, I do like the cd...it is great to play when you have a cranky baby!
B000088E6D|5.0|I feel very foolish. I reviewed this here at Amazon previously after listening to the CD a couple of times. Maybe I was in a bad mood, I don't know....but today I listened to it on the way to work, and then I played it at work. I work in  a very upscale and  very well known Beauty Salon and my customers are \\"trapped\\" with my music for their stay. Well, when I played Michael Buble, everyone went crazy for it. Everyone wanted to know who was singing, and they wrote the name down to go and purchase it. Then I listened to it again on the way home. I now have a new opinion of this CD, and Michael Buble I really blew it when I stated here before that it was a poor imitation. It really isn't an imitation of Frank, and Dean, it's more a tribute to that style of music. I should also note that Michael Buble doesn't imitate anyone's style either. He has a style that is all his own, but still reminds you of other great singers such as Mel Torme or Sinatra. I really think this is a great CD, and that Michael Buble has a great career ahead of him. I would really love to hear him sing some original music too. This just shows that you should really LISTEN to something carefully  before passing judgement!
B00008BLAS|5.0|Shinin On is a great hard rock album, This is from the We're An American band period of GFRs History; where Don Brewer, Grand Funk's Great Drummer and vocalist, steps up with his song writing and lead singing (on songs such as Shinin On, Please Me, Getting Over you, and Carry Me through). And GFR rocks hard on Please Me, Getting Over you, Carry Me through, and Shinin On. The song Destitute N Losin (the B side from Locomotion) is included on this one, and it is a great Mark Farner song. To Get Back in is a good song. Locomotion the number 1 hit from this album, was a big hit for GFR, but kind of hurt the band in that people starting thinking of GFR as a pop band, that must produce hits; and many of the hard core hard rock GFR fans, were disappointed that GFR covered that song, and felt they were selling out for radio play. I personally always liked the song and I love Mark Farner's great Guitar solo in that one. Mr. Pretty Boy is a strange song (no drums) that really does not fit on this hard rock album. BUT over all Shinin On is Pure Grand Funk, and Pure Hard Rock; Don Brewer, Mark Farner, Mel Schacher and Craig Frost rock hard on shinin on. This CD is 24 bit remasterred and has two bonus tracks Destitute and losin, which I mention above, and an alternative version of Shinin on, both are great numbers. The CD sounds great, it also has new liner notes, which are excellent, and very nice artwork. It is a must get for every GFR fan.<br />RickDC
0375414053|5.0|Allison Pearson hit a home run with this novel!  Every working mother with a husband and children will find something to like about this book.  I could definitely relate.  I found myself laughing hysterically in some places and wanting to cry in others.  I felt Kate's inner turmoil as she struggled to turn it on at work, then turn it off to become a totally different person at home.  That was powerful to read.  Even more powerful and touching were the times that the main character was unable to turn it off and on at will.  It's a well written book that demonstrates the complexity of the lives of professional working women today trying to have it all and do it all.  It also brings into question whether having it all is really worth it.
B00005JL78|2.0|This movie starts out with a bang. This first hour is very good. The plot holes and inconsistencies come to a head in the final 45 minutes, tainting the whole movie, and leaving me perplexed by the critical success this film has enjoyed.<br />Plot holes:<BR>-The story is set in an uber-police state, where retinal scans grant you access to buildings, restricted areas, etc. If the chief of police was found guilty of a precrime, wouldn't you shut off his access to the building? The fact he can sneak back into \\"The Temple\\" a day later with his own eyes is a huge plot blunder, given the tight ship Precrime runs.<br />-Anderton's \\"crime\\" is more of the red ball variety. This flaw is documented in other Amazon user reviews of this movie.<br />-If the organ player really had anything to worry about when he was held at gunpoint, the Precrime police would have arrested (\\"halo-ed\\") Anderton's wife before she pulled the trigger, right?<BR> <BR>This movie sets up too many rules that it's not prepared to break. And boy, that eyeball sure keeps real well in that little plastic bag.<br />Another criticism of the movie is the characterization. Colin Farrell's character is way over-the-top, then does a complete 180. A lot of the peripheral characters (the woman in the greenhouse, the guy in the video-fantasy parlor) feel tacked on, their only role being plot exposition.<br />The end of the movie (the showdown with Max Von Sydow's character) is extremely anti-climatic, and, of course, Spielberg leaves us with a voice-over that tells us what else happened, and, of course, how to feel about it as an audience. Thanks Steven...thanks for pushing our imagination away from your film.<br />As far as Spielberg movies go, the look and action of the movie is great. When it's at it's best, Minority Report almost feels like Blade Runner or a Terry Gilliam movie (the transplant scene). So, this leads me to the obvious: see Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, or Brazil instead. Minority Report is good. It'snot great. And there are better, more entertaining films out there.
B00005S6K8|4.0|Let's simply step away from this continuous obsession with the original &quot;Sabrina.&quot;  These are two different films--black and white versus color, Bogart versus Ford, then versus now.  They share a plot form, but we the audience truly need not compare the two--better to enjoy them as two distinct films, each offering its own blessing.<br />Having said that, I confess that I enjoyed in this modern Sabrina what others have criticized, namely its ambiguity.  We don't always see into our characters' minds so that every move is telegraphed.  Instead, we retain some sense of mystery and uncertainty, which both produce lasting interest in the characters.  Vulnerability is heightened, a neat and tidy ending is averted.  This makes the film richer and more durable.<br />Pollack also achieves a fine look for his film, and a leisurely pace for unfolding the story.  Enjoy &quot;Sabrina,&quot; a true original.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I think this album confirms Incubus as being true artists.  There's nothing worst to me then when a band is not inclined to change in any way shape or form;  Everything becomes boring with nothing new and riveting.  This album is a step into the softer side of Incubus, and it still features some of their best written songs to date.  The mood is overall, a complete turnaround from Make Yourself.  Morning View teaches you to embrace life, and it's like a walk on the Oceans shore on a summer night in California.  It literally makes you feel like your their!  <br />It's an ideal album to put you in a good mood or to relax you.  There's one song off the album that has anger in it, and is probably their most underrated song as it it my second favorite from them of all time.  &quot;Under my Umbrella&quot; is about bigots essentially.  This is such a good album.  Buy this is you have diverse music taste and you love all rock and roll.  This band gives you your money's worth for each album, and they surely make the best of each album that they can.
B000089RVX|2.0|While 2003 looks like it's going to be a good year for rock music thanks to the many true artists playing today, Evanescence offers little more than boring, commercialized movie music.  Wind-Up Records, who have signed other spectacularly shallow groups such as Drowning Pool and Creed, are going for a trifecta with Evanescence and are making all the same mistakes.  Coming across as one part nu-metal, another part pseudo-goth, 'Fallen' falls short in all aspects and sounds like a bad mixture between Linkin Park and Type O Negative.  The only shining element of the group, the female vocalist Amy Lee, does have quite an angelic voice.  Unfortunatly her musical counterparts can't seem to write appropriate music to back her up and instead go for the same cliche chord structures and nu-metal riffs. Also, we can't help but laugh when the rapping starts; it just sounds completly ridiculous and out of place.  It's as if the producer told them that due to the success of Linkin Park that they need a rapper, and the band sheepishly abliged.  In general, 'Fallen' sounds completely overproduced in most parts, causing it to lose any emotion and drive that it might possibly have otherwise.       <br />Ultimatly Evanescence brings nothing new or interesting to the musical table.  The lyrics are silly, the album is vastly overproduced, and their entire act screams 'wanna-be'.  All the black, metal-studded clothing and photoshop filters can't change this band from being anything more than two former church-camp kids.  Pass on this Clear Channel &quot;buzz band&quot;.
0743420373|3.0|I like the book in general, but hated the ending.  On the VERY LAST PAGE, (the 3rd to last sentence) the authors state ALL their statistical evidence is based on the results from surveys of only 385 &quot;Millionaire families&quot;.  385!  Do you have any idea of the statistical inaccuracies that can result from such a small sample group?  No wonder they buried this piece of information.  It would be like a political pollster asking people of conservative area a question, then stating that's how all Americans felt.  Plus the way they use the statistics only help to confuse the reader, not make their point.<br />Their anecdotal evidence is much better.  There is a lot to learn from the stories they tell.  As a whole, I liked the book.  But I never like it when authors try to slip one past me.
B000089RVX|5.0|In this age of tenny-bopper music mostly everything is recycled and repetitive. Get some good beat and throw in a half-naked girl better yet throw in a pair of girls and have them kiss each other. when i first heard Evanescence's debut single, Bring Me To life, my jaw dropped and I was awe-struck by the beauty and power of the song. I still don't have a clear answer on why i was attracted to them. Amy Lee has such a beautiful voice which rivals Tori Amos and has the emotion of Chester Bennington of linkin park. If you want to listen to music that will make you contemplate life in general and emotions in particular then this it. They have uplifting rock beats that will fill you with energy as well as soaring piano ballads that will make you weep. Great gift to give to your boyfriend/husband or girlfriend/wife.

B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is anything but square!  How can someone so young have such a strong voice and write such moving lyrics!  I heard him at the Grammy's and was moved.  I bought the CD and I am in awe of the whole collection.  He definitely deserved the Best Newcomer Award!  At his age, we have many many years of great music to come but make sure you get in at square one with this CD.
B000089RVX|5.0|I went to see Daredevil with some friends, and I fell in love with the music, so I odwnloaded the cd. I got intrigued by the dark,eerie sounds from the band Evanescence. I went to buy their cd the morning it came out, March 4, 2003. I popped it into my cd player and was immediately taken aback as all of the songs played through, the lyrics going smoothly through my head. The great thing about this cd is that no two songs sound the same. This cd was completely the opposite of what I was expecting. The music completely connected with my inner thoughts and feelings. I think this band is definitely going somewhere, and they're getting there very fast.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|As a movie The Hours seemed like . . . well . . . hours.  It was a terribly dull film  -  after giggling at Nicole Kidman's nasal prosthesis I tried really hard, for want of anything else to do, to go to sleep, but it's so difficult in a matinee.  If you want a two hour encounter with a trio of menopausal women with lesbian tendencies and an over-abundance of neuroses then you'll love this one . . .  On the other hand the soundtrack is memorable and truly excellent.  Buy the CD, avoid the film.
0786915749|2.0|I must admit that I'll read just about anything.  I nearly stopped reading this book, and I'm still debating returning it to the used bookstore, along with the rest of the series.<br />The plot is disjointed, which is explained in the after word.<BR>The authors modified the plot based on gaming sessions that they had during the project.  Although the scenes derived from those sessions are memorable and humorous their integration causes the greatest holes in the story line.<br />I occasionally felt that I was being slapped in the face with game mechanics.  This is bad enough during a role-playing session, and I find it unacceptable in a novel.<br />The ending in addition to the books role as a successful hook into the rest of the series is what spares this book a single star.
B00008BXJF|5.0|I know that the first day of listening to an album is not necessarily the best time to write a balanced review, but I have heard most of this material previously on live EPs or in concert.  Many people like me may look at this album and balk at shelling out the cash for so much &quot;rehashed&quot; material, but I will say right now, it is definitely worth it.<br />I was amazed when listening to this for the first time at how much farther the band has taken this material, such as &quot;Level Five&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Curves,&quot; than ever before.  The production is absolutely perfect, capturing with clarity and power the intensity and precision of the band.  And after listening to the entire album, I see an overall compositional arc unlike anything K.C. has produced since &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon.&quot;  The band is really capturing the spirit of King Crimson that has manifested itself to a greater or lesser degree since 1969, and is continuing to push it further.<br />OK, stop reading this and click Add to Cart now!

Will the Civil War get in the way or will they kill each other instead?  Two hours and 43 minutes of fast action, cruel landscapes and nice guns.
B000089RVX|5.0|a few weeks ago i picked up the daredevil soundtrack and after a few listens thru the only band i was listening to was Evanescence...so today...i was sure to buy it the moment sam goody opened....its worth every penny...the female linkin park without rapping 'nuff said.<br />so far my favorite song is Going under and everybodys fool, but who cares about me right? Amys voice on this cd is heavenly..shes a damn angel and shes kinda hot in a gothic type way...and Bens riviting guitar riffsmake their debut cd one of the best of its time...truely unique in sound every song is different go get it...now...
B000089RVX|5.0|Most people who have heard this band were probably first exposed to them via the movie Daredevil.  I, for one, would like to thank whomever hooked up Evanescence with that deal.  Now, what used to be a realtively unknown band from Little Rock is on the verge of a MUCH deserved breakout success.  Amy Lee's vocals are simply enchanting, making all the so-called pop diva's sound like the pretenders that they are.  The music has the crunchy, guitar-driven sound common among so many modern hard rock/metal bands, but it rises above that cliche and manages to be quite melodic and moving, beautifully complimenting and entertwining with Amy's vocals.  For those who may be worried that the &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; single is just a one-hit wonder, buy this album.  Every track on here is fantastic.  You won't be disappointed.  Here's hoping that Evanescence continues to put out albums for many years to come.
B00008973Q|5.0|Having waited for a long time for a re-issue of this classic by Kurosawa, I was lucky enough to see this digitially restored disk when Wellspring released it in their Limited Edition Kurosawa Collection in the Fall of 2002. Not only is the film everything it's known to be, but this new DVD which is a Hi Def, Digitally restored one in 16:9, is simply stunning. The visuals are all one would hope for, and the commentary tracks (2) are insighful and thoroughly enjoyable. Once you view it, you will now understand why RAN was nominated for so many Academy Awards and, more importantly, why it won for Best Costumes. This \\"Masterworks\\" edition is a Masterworks on multiple fronts... a master's work on film, by a masterful director with a DVD product that is masterful in its own right!
B000002J1B|5.0|It's the ability to make music that journeys so far that is most remarkable about Yes.  This music is not rock, but beautifully dynamic experiments in sound with the crisp, clean, articulate results of true vision.  You can have this music in the background &amp; ride on the energy or you can listen so intensely to all the things it does, all the complexely textured nuances &amp; all the changes.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've tracked through this disc a bunch of times now - It just keeps getting better with each listen. It didn't take long to realize \\"Fallen\\" was going to make its way into my rotation of discs I listen to a lot. I found myself anxiously waiting to hear what came next while listening to it, which rarely happens.<br />Their music is hauntingly dark, and beautiful at the same time, and it does have its \\"rock\\" moments, thanks to some really nice guitar sounds. And I *love* Amy's voice! The production is huge sounding; the songs are beautifully textured with keyboards, strings and layered back up vocals.<br />This is not a 'rap-metal' band, if you've only heard the \\"Bring Me To Life\\" single. There's a lot of depth to this group that you might not be expecting to hear ... and a lot of interesting things going on. Definitely not a \\"throw on at a party\\" CD - But one that I find myself wanting to explore beginning to end, again and again.<br />Besides the lead single, I really like \\"Tourniquet\\", \\"Going Under\\", \\"Haunted\\", \\"My Immortal\\", \\"Whisper\\" and \\"My Last Breath.\\" The rest of the songs are also very good ... totally worth picking up, and hopefully an indication of more brilliance to come. Awesome stuff - a CD that's worth your attention.
0385474547|4.0|Achebe's Things Fall Apart is written in simple imagery to describe tribal life in Nigeria. The main character, Okonkwo, is a hard working tribal leader with pride in the customs of his tribe.  When he is forced into exile from the village Okonkwo is forced to learn about different people and traditions.  This book has a lot of symbolism and many lessons to teach.
B000089RVX|5.0|It is refreshing to find a Hard Rock/Alternative group that features a talented female lead singer.  Doubly so one that does not use notoriety or blatant sexuality to pursue its success.  I first heard the Single \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on the radio.  It was one of those songs that caused me to cease whatever I had been doing and just listen.  Amy Lee's voice is entrancing, a voice of true talent amidst a sea of mediocrity.<BR>   I heard more of Evanescence on the DareDevil Album and was pleasantly surprised at what appeared to be consistant quality, in the rather mournful \\"My Immortal\\", yet I was still cautious (being suckered in by too many \\"One Hit Wonders\\"). The full album is everybit as good as the released singles have hinted.  This is loud, lushly layered, dark without being cliche, play over and over again music.  I look forward to more from this talented group.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is high quality!  I would recomend this to anyone espcially if you like groups like Lifehouse and The Calling.  Buy this CD!
6304698542|2.0|This is a classic musical, but my goodness the sound will rupture your eardrums. My god, warner brothers, show your classics some respect. Did they TRY to make it sound this bad? Like fingernails on a chalk board. It's painfully distracting from the film experience. You have to turn up the volume to distinguish the dialogue, and when you do, it sounds ancient. Hissing and noisy. Ugh! And this is the collector's edition?! The film (as in many cases i am finding lately) is worth much more than the DVD treatment it gets.
0452282152|5.0|This coming of age novel features a extrodinarily perceptive but illiterate teenage girl who becomes a maid in the home of the great 17th century Dutch painter Vermeer. Both Vemeer and his wealthy patron are taken with this young woman, and Vemeer immortalizes her in a commissioned work by the patron while diverting her from household duties to become his studio assistant. Juggling household intrigues, unwanted suitors, and a sense of propriety, our heroine manages to navigate her coming of age with a wisdom and charm that make this novel a must read.
0385335482|4.0|What a fun, page-turner.  I found myself cheering for Rebecca and all of her shopping adventures.  I've always been easily convinced with &quot;Buy 1, Get 1 free&quot; sales and can talk myself into &quot;needing&quot; to purchase something.  Rebecca has some credit issues, but is not helpless.  Of course her adventures at work and with dating are also part of the fun.  She is smart and strong and most of all entertaining!
B000089RVX|5.0|It is refreshing to find a Hard Rock/Alternative group with a female vocalist that actually relies on talent to sell music rather than notoriety or blatant sexuality.  I heard the first single \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on the radio, and litterally stopped, doing nothing else than just listening.  The CD fulfills the hopes raised by Bring Me to Life. \\"Fallen\\" is an extraordinary Freshman album, one that I highly reccomend to all fans of Todays rock/alternative music.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Red Hot Chilli Peppers haven't released that many albums considering how long they have been together, but you know when they do release an album, it's going to be something special. <br />Californication is the result of a good few year's work, writing, recording and producing. The Chilli Pepper's production mastermind, Rick Rubin, produced this little gem. <br />Actually it's not a little gem, its a big gleaming thing, crying out the words &quot;Im a big gleaming thing!&quot; The Chilli Peppers knew very well what type of album they were making here. It's grand, it can be complex and intricate, and it can be all out funk rock. <br />I'd say the guitar sequences and riffs are one of the most major assets of this album, doing a lot of holding together. The guitar glue can be heard clearly on tracks like 'Scar Tissue', 'Californication' and 'Road Trippin'. In the old days, The Chilli Peppers were influenced heavily by disco, funk and soul acts like George Clinton and the Parliament. Nowadays in their music you can still hear Flea's funked-up bassline and the out of the ordinary rhythms, but its dressed with newer influences, i would say indirectly the Smashing Pumpkins or Nirvana being examples. The Peppers have certainly moved with the times, but remained with their very unique sound. <br />Anthony Keidis' voice has definetley improved over the years. The songs on Californication allow him to do things that he has previously not done very much (ie Actually sing instead of just rapping). There are a lot of very mellow songs onthis album, like 'Porcelain' and 'Road Trippin'. I like the Chilli Peppers when they are mellow. It gives a good break from the hard stuff, and also Keidis' voice suits them very well. <br />The hard stuff is also very good. The melodies on some of the chouruses are brilliant, for instance one of my favorites is 'Get on Top'. The tunes are just great and theres plent of them. You forget how many of these tracks they have actually released- 'Scar Tissue', 'Otherside', Around The World' and 'Californication'- all brilliant songs. <br />One worry is that they might get too commercial. This album's more commercially sounding than all of the others, despite it's great music. I think the Chilli Peppers are sensible though, and they won't sell out. This has been there most successful album to date, and i hope they can keep on doing it.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I'm going to have to agree with the reviewer from Greece below - this film HAD potential. The first half, with 'Duel'-like cat-and-mouse game as well as the menacing figure of the Creeper dumping bodies into the sewer worked very well. The church added a nice, gothic touch and the rural setting pumped up the atmosphere very nicely....then....well.....things started getting really stupid.<br />The Creeper, once revealed, looked really unconvincing - looked like a guy in a mask. The plot got pretty convuluted and silly, offering answers with no explinations/back story other than to move the plot along. It became, just like past reviewers said, a C-Grade horror flick at best. Dumb dialouge, dumb effects, dumb all around, Jeepers Creepers became a poor man's Nightmare on Elm St, barely rising above that franchises tired sequels, and it really failed to live up to it's first half hour of potential.
B00004BZ16|5.0|...<br />... It's breathlessly, soulfully, magnificently, purely, darkly, CLASH. It's the sum of their brilliance. It's the heart of their soul. Listen to every single rabid, mournful, and cantankerous note, all rooted in global pain and caring, and be transported to a place that's like no other.<br />... It's the greatest multiple album ever recorded, and eventually, ... the world will know this.
B000089RVX|5.0|I originally heard the 2 songs \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" on the \\"Daredevil\\" soundtrack and was blown away by the music.  I did a little checking around only to find out the band hadn't even released an album yet!  So, today, the first thing I did was go and buy it.  Let me tell you that not a SINGLE song on this album will leave you disappointed in any way whatsoever!  Every song is a complete masterpiece with Amy's haunting vocals, awesome piano, guitars and drums, and even symphonies.  In my opinion, this is the band that modern rock has been needing for years now; and even better, with a female lead vocalist. Very original sound!  Definitely my pick for the best rock album this year!  Buy it, I promise you won't be disappointed!
B00005JLRT|4.0|that they decide to release a Special Edition DVD for this. The movie, although great for the most part, is terribly depressing, and shoul have extras that feature funny things, or this won't be worth getting!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Okay, I have to admit that when I first bought this album I was not a huge fan of it, I listened to it a few times and it took a back slot in my CD wallet, I have been a fan of Rage Against The Machine for a while, but the only song that I really loved at the time on the album was `Guerrilla Radio' which everyone should know is off the MI2 soundtrack, as well as the main tune of the game smash hit `Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2' so it is quite a well known song. <br />But somehow or another this album managed to find it's way back into my CD player, and it has hardly left since, I mean I still like Guerrilla Radio a lot, but I have become appreciative of the style of the album, and the other tracks that it offers. <br />I will not compare this album to the other albums that have been raved about, over and over, and I will do this for the simple reason that I don't really think it matters, I mean surely the only thing that matters is how good this album is not how well it compares to the other CD's in your collection. Some people have said it isn't as good, but I still say that it is amazing. <br />By the way, before I continue I would like to put a mention saying that Rage Against The Machine are hopefully going to make a come back, only this time without Zach De La Rocha, they will also be keeping the same name, I have heard to expect something from next couple of years. That was one other thing that `Rage Against The Machine' were famous for, band disputes, they got out four albums in the lengthy space of eight years, I am sure that this number would have been a lot bigger if they had managed to stay friends all the way through. <br />Okay, I have rambled for a bit too long here, back to this album, due to the style of Rage Against The Machine the songs do not differ THAT much, but they do differ, some are more toned down, with a strong meaning behind them, some are cool guitar rifts all the way through, but in my mind there is not one bad track on this album. And thatis something that not a lot of albums can boast about. <br />Okay, well, now that I have said that this album is blinding I will go back to my initial point, this album did take me quite a while to get into it, it is a particular style, they sound completely different to any other band out there in my mind, so they do take some getting used to, but if you do want to go out and buy something just that little different, then I suggest that this is the album for you, or pretty much any Rage Against The Machine album out there on the market. <br />I will certainly be looking out for whatever this band do in future, with any kind of reformation that they have planned. <br />Thank you for reading. <br />Chris Pollard<BR>(punk-punk-punk)

B000058T5E|5.0|This albums rocks really hard. I can't think of anyone who progressed as much in their careers as Jeff Beck... You Had It Coming is by far my favorite album yet. Can't wait to see what Jeff has in store for us next! Great guitar here... just push play and let the music take you away.<br />My favorites: Dirty Mind, Nadia, Loose Cannon, Suspension.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Can she sing?  Yes!  However, not in the mode of a Billie Holiday or an Anita Baker.  This is not Jazz, but Folk.  Ms. Jones has no vocal range and little interpretability of the lyrics.  Nothing exciting here.  Nothing innovative.  Nothing plus nothing equals nothing.  She is just another pretty face.  The ears don't lie -- she is just an average singer with a great promoter.  This CD will not stand the test of time.  Guarantee!
6305878323|5.0|I really can't add anything unique in terms of superlative descriptions (a wonderful marriage of live action cinematography and animation; great songs and lyrics; top-notch story adaptation), so I'll just concentrate on perfomances: Dick Van Dyke in a one-man band performance (literally and fictionally) of singer, dancer, comic, and enigmatic companion to lead Julie Andrews (in her debut film!) who manages to be equally charming, sharp, pseudo-caustic, and wistful all at once. I especially love the scene which shows the first time the children are ordered to bed (after a rainstorm forces them 'out' of a watercolor painting) and, much too excited to forget about their magical day, are finally sung to sleep by Ms. Andrews in the contradictory \\"Stay Awake\\" lullaby. It is a great scene/number which gives some insight to Mary Poppins' character: efficient, strict, crisp, but also secretly caring and sentimental- just as long as nobody witnesses as such. This is re-iterated in her closing lines about 'practically perfect people,' but it is a carefully staged balance of emotions just the same. She deserved the Best Actress Oscar every step of the way.

B00004XOWM|4.0|I think this album is their best album. It looks like Wes used the guitar pedal a lot. Like in the r-rated Hotdog. The only bad thing bad about the album is that there is a little to dark. Well, enjoy!
B00005ASOC|5.0|I really liked the movie. And I would recomend the movie to all my friends. Because the actors Rob Brown, Sean Coonery and the whole cast did a really good job in showing how people are in some places. I really admired how Jamal Wallece (Rob Brown) did his part in how he was discriminated because he was poor and black.I really liked it and I wouldn't chage a bit of it.Because it really capture the feeling of the people and how life really is. One of the massages that the film had was the meanig of friendship and it made me feel kind of sad sad because people have to live like that in a world that they do not feel good being in.This is a great movie and i would recomend it to everyone.
B000059XVS|5.0|Peter O'Toole is so wonderful in this epic drama involving a man who takes over a group of Arabs and teaches them how to fight for what they want, not for England but for Arabia. His acting shows a man who is narcissitic but also extremely just. He is conceited but in a good way. He wants to lead the Arabs to freedom in their country but he tends to come across almost Godly in his leadership. He loses control in war, taking on a primitive need to kill and to be victorious. It is a struggle his compassion and justness and his thirst for blood and superiority. He has to be in the limelight and believes that he is blessed to overcome all obstacles. It is a spectacle to watch Lawrence of Arabia, because of this performance and I hope you can see what I mean and relate. <br />Lisa Nary
0792844882|5.0|This is hands down the funniest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!!   I own it on DVD and VHS.   This may well be one of my favorite movies of all time.   I'm not sure why, but I never get sick of it.   I'm sure everyone knows by now that it's not supposed to be funny; it just is!   The elaborate vegas dance numbers play out like a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit.   The nudity and profanity in the movie are absurd and hysterical.   Everything about this movie is so bad it's good.   They could not have made it funnier if they had actually tried!!   I LOVE it!
0553212478|1.0|I'm sure that I'll have people wanting my blood for this, but I have to be honest. This book is horrible. Absoulutely horrible from start to finish. The writing is grade-schoolish, the plot moves to slowly and is so far fetched that one can't lose one's suspension of disbelief no matter how hard the reater tries, and frankly the monster itself is sleep-inducing.<br />Don't bother with this book. For that matter, don't bother with the movies either. Frankenstein, the book and all things spawned from this book, is the single most overrated work in literature.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is the latest in a long line of powerful necromancers who can not only raise the dead but whose task it is to set the undead to rest.  Residing at a private school away from home, she receives a message that her father is trapped somewhere beyond the realm of the dead.  She must travel back to the Old Kingdom where she was born to free him, but finds herself pursued by dead forces which she may very well lack the training and experience to combat.<br />Sabriel's world is an unusual one in that there is magic as well as technology, but this book focuses more on the characters and leaves much of the world around them only hinted at.  In addition, the author drops us right into the action with little preamble.  This is disorienting at first, but it enables the reader to feel firmly entrenched in the world of the novel, and less like an outsider who is only reading about it.<br />While the story has a slow beginning, once Sabriel begins her journey it is gripping and suspenseful.  It is not exactly horror, but its imagery does set it firmly in the realm of dark fantasy.  And although it is written for and marketed to younger readers, adults should not find it beneath them.  The story is complete but one gets the feeling that there is still much to explore, and I am very much looking forward to doing so in the books that follow.
B00006LLNU|3.0|The music on this album is very beautiful.   However, most of the untitled 'songs' flow together and sound very similar.   There is definately not much variety on this album.   The sounds, voices, and tempo remain consistent throughout the entire disc, making it perfect fall asleep/background music.
6303168507|5.0|I have long been a fan of Steven Spielberg's films, but Schindler's List is the first movie of his that has literally moved me to tears.  Based on the book by Thomas Keneally, it tells the story of Oskar Schindler (played by the wonderful Liam Neeson), a womanizer and member of the Nazi Party who nevertheless did his best to help keep Polish Jews from going to the death camps during World War 2.  Outwardly, Schindler is a typical Nazi--hanging out with people such as Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) and trying his level best to run a business during the war.<br />Schindler's List, however, portrays another side to the man--his domestic troubles with his wife, Emilie (Caroline Goodall) because of his womanizing, and the difficulties of trying to keep his business staffed and his Jewish workers from being killed.  In this effort he is assisted by his accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), who recruits families to work for Schindler while Schindler claims they are \\"essential workers\\" in order to keep them from being executed by German officers on the street.  When the Schindler Jews are about to be moved to another camp, he saves the life of Goeth's maid, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) in a game of chance and puts her name on the list of Jews that are going with him as workers.<br />One of the things I liked most about Schindler's List is the fact that it was filmed in black and white, instead of color.  I felt that filming it in black and white (with the exception of one or two color segments) gave it a gritty sense of realism that added to the story's emotional impact and drama, rather than detracting from it.  This was definitely an inspired choice in making the film.<br />All in all, Schindler's List is a very profound, moving film.  It is my hope that people out there will continue to learn from, and be touched by, this work of Steven Spielberg.
B00008BXJF|5.0|The past production from KC, &quot;Construcktion of Light&quot; was a very dark and not-so-creative experiment from the band founded by Robert Fripp in 1969. This time around, the double trio goes down (as it did on tour) to a more typical lineup of four musicians as it used to be through the eighties: Fripp on guitar, Adrian Belew on guitar and lead vocals, Trey Gunn on touch guitar and Pat Mastelotto on drums. The most recent production to come out of the mastermind of Robert Fripp is taking the band in a new direction, as tracks such as the incredible and progressive song &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; and &quot;The Power To Believe III&quot; proove. Also to become extremely influential and standing a chance to air on commercial radio (a rarity with KC's work) are the tongue-twisting &quot;Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With&quot; and the more mellow &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot; which reminds a bit of the sound of the band in the early eighties. Borrowing from the title of the song, I am 'happy with what I have to be happy with': I am happy with the newest King Crimson production, a living proof that the four-decades old band is still kicking some serious music around.
0395177111|5.0|The Hobbit is a fascinating adventure tale about wizards, elves, dwarves, dragons, and many other fantasized creatures. Burrowed inside a hill, deep within Hobbiton, lives a particularly interestesting hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.  Being the jolly little hobbit that he is, Bilbo enjoys his peaceful life in the Shire until he is summoned by the old wizard, Gandalf, to go on an adventure across the lands.  Bilbo accepts this adventure and sets out into the unknown on a quest for gold and riches. On his quest through the land, curious young Bilbo encounters many new things that are foreign to the Shire and life as he has known it. Traveling over the lands to strange towns, treacherous mountains, and dangerous forests the hobbit gains possession of a magic ring that he uses to his advantage on this journey for fortune.<BR> This novel has been acclaimed a classic through generations for over the past 60 years.  The Hobbit is an adventurous book about strange lands from long ago in a time when things were very different than they are today.  The book is sometimes a little hard to follow with its elfish dialect and some tongue twisting sentences, but it is nothing a couple of read-through's can't fix.  You may hit some boring drawn-out scenes, but stick with it.  Once you are into the heart of the story, you will find it hard to put down.   If you have a vivid imagination and an interest in fantasy, than this book will become a classic favorite of yours too.
0671027344|2.0|Charlie, the main character, is experiencing his first year of high school.  His friend past away during the summer and he is very nervous about high school.  He relieves some of this nervousness by writing letters(the format of the book) to an annonymous recipient, whose identity is never revealed.  The letter writing was recommended by his English teacher, in which Charlie has an abnormal relationship with.  Charlie meets two friends who are seniors.  They make his first year experiences, somewhat too mature and illegal for anyone.<br />After reading this book, I was left with an unsettling feeling.  I was very surprised and disturbed by the content of this book.  Some of Charlie's experiences, I feel should not have been shared.  If Mr. Chobsky felt that he needed to share every experience, then I think he should have used some discretion.  I think this book is a bit too crude for young adults.  I would not broadcast or recommend this book for high school students.

B00005K9LK|3.0|I became a huge fan of Judas Priest since I first heard Unleashed in the East in 1979. The Priest was building enormeous momentum in the late '70s, especially by opening to Kiss and more often than not, stealing the show with their raw power and energetic brand of heavy metal. Judas Priest's music was fresh and their attitude made them the new underdog favorites of the new heavy metal scene. Rob Halford's voice and presence ruled the stage.<br />By 1980, the Priest finally made it relatively big with British Steel. Released in 1982, Screaming for Vengeance emerged with fury after a lukewarm release (Point of Entry). Screaming for Vengenace has plenty of catchy metal riffs, which blended perfectly with Rob Halford's thunderous voice.<br />However, Screaming for Vengeance's purpose was solely to gain commercial success, and they achieved it. This is one of the better liked productions of the band (as other reviewers have attested). But to me, the majority of the songs in Screaming for Vengeance lack creativity, musicality and power. Also, Rob's lyrical mystique was gone here. Glenn and KK's guitars are very good as usual, although a bit constrained compared to earlier releases. Ian Hill's bass is almost unnoticeable. It also didn't help that the drums are so boring and tepid here. Ex-Trapeze drummer Dave Holland only uses the hi-hat closed in every single song... After the third song I get tired of the same sound over and over. He never bothered to open the hi-hat or to use the ride cymbal at all. Although he had double bass drums, he rarely played them. Sorry, but Judas Priest's music should be played with a fiery drummer. I don't think Holland was even able to play older gems like Exciter or Here Comes The Priest. It was simply impossible for him technically, and this translated to the &quot;just decent&quot; quality of Judas Priest's music circa 1982. If you have never heard the Priest, just listen to any album they released prior to 1980 (with Les Binks and/or Simon Phillips on drums), or to Painkiller in 1990, with Scott Travis bashing the skins. Not a bad album, but not nearly the best from the mighty Priest!imon Phillips on drums), or to Painkiller in 1990, with Scott Travis bashing the skins. Not a bad album, but not nearly the best from the mighty Priest!
B000007OY0|5.0|This is in the top 5 films I have ever seen.  The moment when Tim Robbins plays the opera over the loud speakers is very moving.  I would like to know the name of the opera and the names of the two women singing it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|After all the Britneys, Christinas, and boy bands it's nice to finally get an album from someone that has genuine talent and doesn't feel she needs to compromise herself or her music to sell records.  This is a great album and not only did she deserve all those Grammys but it was unfortunate she didn't get more. I highly recommend this album to anyone that loves music but hates the manufactured garbage so prominent on MTV and the radio.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a triumph of storytelling, and a delight to watch.  The animation is typical of Studio Ghibli, in that it is very stylized and simple, yet very attentive to the subtle nuances of human expression.  The film was an absolute delight to watch, and it never copped out to silliness or a cheap tear-jerking tragedy (a.k.a. kill-off-a-supporting-character-to-make-the-kids-bawl-Disney).  It also stays completely away from typical American cliche plot-devices, and lame Disneyesque supersaturated cuteness.  When all that is stripped away, you are left with a quietly breathtaking and imaginative journey into traditional Japanese culture, mythical fantasy, and the human spirit.  And the film is not meant for your toddler, period.<BR>     In Japan, it is perfectly acceptable to market an animated film to an adult crowd.  If you try to do that here, everyone will think that the film is pornographic.  Why?  Because Americans think that all cartoons are for kids, and the ones that are not for kids are porn.  This type of thinking is narrow-minded and stupid.  Granted, there are a lot of animated porn films coming out of Japan, but that's only because most of the American distributors that are buying the films think that porn and little kids' shows are the only thing that sell in this country.  The worst part about it?  They're right.  Americans won't buy the other stuff, because we refuse to give anything new a chance.  <BR>     For whatever it's worth to all you one-star raters, you have completely missed the point with this film.  It's not meant for your four-year-old, and it's not supposed to be nicey-cutesy-fuzzy-wuzzy-sweetie-kissy-Disney.  This is a landmark achievement in filmmaking that is meant to be enjoyed, understood, and pondered later; three things your little one more than likely will not do.  So if you are one of those people who would feel embarassed if your were seen going into a theater that was showing an animated film, stay away from good animelike this, and stick with the nice, safe cartoons about horsies and dalmatian doggies.<BR>     To all the rest of you that can tell a good film when you see it, and won't pass judgement on it before it has a chance to carry you away: Please help keep good anime coming to America, and buy this film.  It is not \\"mean\\" or \\"nonsensical\\" like some one-star-reviewers say.  It is groundbreaking, epic fantasy animation.  And it's not for the toddlers.  Buy them a Rugrats tape.
B00007BH5C|3.0|Howard Shore's masterpiece score to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is by far is greatest work yet. Every song was filled with emotion and feeling that just made listeners feel like they were actually in Middle Earth. Sadly that overwhelming feeling isnt as strongly present in \\"The Two Towers.\\" The first five tracks are all wonderful. Foundations of Stone, The Riders of Rohan, and The King of the Golden Hall are all superb! Several other tracks near the beginning are wonderful as well. The downside to the soundtrack starts around Track seven and just becomes a blob of music with no real solid base to it. Most of the songs are simply based on themes originally written for the first film. Soundtracks of the Star Wars trilogy dont make the mistake of over using themes as seen on this soundtrack. The first soundtrack was a perfect blend of dark, happy, scary, powerful and emotional tracks while this cd doesnt offer the same feel. Sure it has beautiful music but it's nothing compared to the original.<br />All you Lord of the Rings Junkies (you know who you are) please dont kill me ;-)
B000089RVX|5.0|This is literally the best band I've heard in a long time. You're combining gorgeous female vocals with edgey rock, which I think is the best of both worlds. The height of emotion this album creates is awesome in the sense that you really can feel the music as the album plays. I've never heard a band of this caliber play with the passion it does. This is definitely a band quickly screaming up the charts. INCREDIBLE.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|I actually enjoyed this movie. Its a great ride! It has the perfect mixture of humor and fast cars. It is much more action oriented then similar car movies like the Fast and the Furious, but what would you expect from the great Jerry B. He is absolutely the king of action movies, ie. Top Gun and Amargeddon. Additionally, the movie host a score of top notch Oscar winning actors, and some fresh new faces.<br />Overall it's a fast paced romp in the streets.
B000069CWE|1.0|This album is a complete insult to the great band Linkin Park. No matter how hard anyone tries noone can ever imitate or come even close to imitating Linkin Park.  In my opion if you like Linkin Park dont buy this CD
0807282375|4.0|it was a great book, with the best writing i've ever ever read in my life. it's not offensive at all, and it's only fiction anyway. i was just confused by the ending.
B00005JLXC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I was not sure what to expect but I did like the movie overall. I found the title character a unique superhero who was easy to relate to. Jennifer Garner and Colin Farrell practiclaly steal the show. The stunts were great and the special effects superb. This is not your run of the mill super hero flick. It is  a step above in concept, writing and acting.
0316096199|4.0|I was captivated by this woman's story, and impressed with the courageous way she dealt with being raped. When most girls in her situation kept quiet and felt ashamed, Alice does the opposite. I felt a little cheated with how she described her life after the trial though. I finished the book wondering if her life is good now, or if she's depressed, alone, and suffering from substance abuse problems. I can't wait to read Lovely Bones now and see how that book compares.
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm not much into that rapmetal kind of stuff, be these guys are closer to metal that most of those wannabe acts on MTV. I mostly listen to Punk, Hardcore, REAL metal, and Ska, so I was surprised that I like this. The best tracks are Papercut, One Step Closer, Points of Authority, Crawling, In the End, and By Myself. This is one of the few talented bands on MTV, but sadly their following CD Re-animation doesn't even live up to this. Oh well, if you haven't bought this yet, you're a complete looser, because it has been out for a long while now. Buy it today. JUST REMEMBER THAT THIS IS NOT METAL!!!!
0767903854|5.0|I have lived in Australia for a cumlitive total of two years of my life, and this book is a great overview of the entire country. A must read for anyone going down under.
B00006G8LB|5.0|. . . and we're all stuck to it.  In fact, his web is so strong that our eyes are glued to the movie.  And event like that happened to me; I can't get my eyes of the  movie.  The same thing will probably happen to you, too.<br />Though appearing to be cool and breathtaking at first sight, Spidey (Tobey Maguire) didn't start that way.  As a regular guy, Peter Parker has lived an ordinary life, until now . . .  While visiting a laboratory, Peter is bitten by a genetically mutated spider - and now, he gains super powers as well as the amazing abilities of the spider, transforming him into the web-swinging hero that we all know a love.<br />Spider-Man - now that is a word we all know.  We've seen his cartoons, and we've all heard about or read his comics.  And with this Hollywood adaptation of the classic comic book, we can see Spidey in real action, as well as relive the story.  Though not 100% accurate, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; follows the storyline carefully and faithfully.<br />Recommended to action and movie fans everywhere.
B00006690H|5.0|I am a 40 year old social worker and I recently bought Eminem's CD to see what all the commotion was about. This guy is fantastic! The beat is catchy and the songs range from painfully truthful to hysterically funny. I loved the song he did with his daughter, \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy.\\" This young man is a truly gifted artist, and I now understand why so many young people respond to him. He speaks the truth about what it's like growing up in \\"White America\\".
6300213668|2.0|Considered one of the greatest musicals out there, this film adaptation of the smash hit play, &quot;Grease&quot;, has today become a classic.  But not for me.  While the songs are exciting and fit for a party, their old-fashioned, 50's style of tune makes them real annoying!  Well, what's the story.  I must say that it's nothing, except the story of two teenagers, whose life stories their senior high school are told through rock 'n' roll music.  Actors are mediocre, John Travolta stunk.  So if you enjoy musicals, this one's for you.  But, if you are easily annoyed, watch something else.
B000002LGQ|5.0|ive been a life long fan of mrs. ritchie. i think she is the most underratted songwriter in pop music today. this album she truely showcases her songwriting ability. she bares her soul on this disc like never before even ray of light doesnt top this. oh father is my favorite to this day. that song stirs something in me i find myself walking down the street singing it to myself. this is a must have . even if u arent the biggest madonna fan give it a try.
0767847431|4.0|Sinbad embarks on another adventure of magic and monsters.  In the pre-George Lucas/Steven Spielberg days, the greatest fantasy adventure films were the ones that featured the eye-popping special effects of Ray Harryhausen. This 1974 movie recalls the halcyon days of the late '50s and early '60s when Saturday matinees at the local movie theater ruled the entertainment world of pre-teens. Although this flick suffers in comparison with the superior \\"7th Voyage of Sinbad,\\" there is enough to like about it to recommend viewing and ownership. The monsters are good, especially the centaur/cyclops that threatens the delectable Caroline Munro. The sword fight with the multi-limbed statue of the goddess Kali recall's RH's previous work in \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\" with the hydra-headed dragon and the army of skeletons. The animation and non-computerized FX are eye pleasing enough that one wishes for more screen time for the monsters. The plot occasionally gets in the way of the action. Once the FX kicks in, things get livelier. John Phillip Law is okay, if a little bland, as Sinbad. Caroline Munro in a slave girl costume distracts the male viewer from quibbling over minor faults along the way. Sometime Doctor Who, Tom Baker, is effective as Koura, the evil magician. This is good \\"G\\" rated entertainment that pleases Ray Harryhausen fans and pre-teens of all ages. Suspend disbelief and have fun. ;-)
B00000AOTZ|5.0|This CD is amazingly awesome. I love the sound of every track on here, it just suits the tone and feel of the film, and the songs are very cool on their own. The Warriors is easily one of the greatest films of all time, and the theme is one of the best I've ever heard, it just builds into this really techno rock sound, it's awesome. A must have for any 70's enthusiast or rock fan.
B00005JKES|5.0|Not much more can I add to entice any of you to purchase this masterpiece. The intricate character developments from Pete calling Harry with that cryptic \\"she's dead...wrapped in plastic\\" to Deputy Andy and Lucy's intricate social relationship, and of course, not to be outdone by Leland Palmer (especially when he hops on Laura's casket at the funeral and rides it up and down)...PRICELESS!, the Norweigans...Big Ed Hurley, it's all the quirky characters that make this the treasure that it truly is! If you don't buy it - - well - - that would be crazy. ahhhh Douglas Firs, and coffee, black as midnight on a moonless night!
B0000029GA|3.0|Y'all can't be serious about giving this album 5 stars. It's bad enough The Source magazine gave it 5 mics.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|WHAT IF someone else had the rights to do a needless retread <BR>of THUNDERBALL? WHAT IF an elderly James Bond was called back into <BR>service? WHAT IF Sean Connery said yes to this proposal? WHAT IF <BR>Kim Basinger were a Bond girl? WHAT IF you were asked to believe <BR>that Blofeld and SPECTRE were still around? WHAT IF there is <BR>another Bond film in theatres at the same time? You have all your <BR>answers to these questions embodied in a film call NEVER SAY NEVER <BR>AGAIN. <br />I just viewed this film for the first time and was compelled to share <BR>my reaction to it with the world. What can I say? Having been a fan <BR>of the Bond films for the last 24 years, I thought this particular <BR>entry was a joke. The whole approach of a retired agent being <BR>recalled for service to a now defunct \\"00\\" branch is the perfect set <BR>up for a parody. The new cast (Q, M, and co.) simply doesn't work. <BR>This may be my refusal to accept different actors in the familiar <BR>roles, but I don't seem to suffer this problem in the newer Bond <BR>films (THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS till now). Perhaps this is due to the <BR>fact that the new films aren't using an aging performer in the <BR>role of Bond. Sean Connery may have been the original Bond, but surrounding him with a completely new cast simply <BR>comes off as laughable. Everyone may have been older than need be for a Bond film in A VIEW TO A <BR>KILL, but the all important chemistry was still there! Not true in this particular installmet, which is devoid of everything that makes us love the real Bond movies! <br />Kim Basinger???? I guess they thought this was inspired casting. <BR>Inspired next to the rest of this films casting maybe, but not <BR>beyond! To all of you who give this film good marks, do the <BR>audiences really get thrilled over watching a relationship ensue while featuring such a large age gap? I can't speak for others, but I find this aspect of the film distasteful.<br />The action. Again, uninspired,unthrilling, and laughable. This <BR>film simply lacks everything that makes a Bond film enjoyable, from <BR>the action to the gadgets, music, women, and a truly memorable <BR>villain. This version of Largo is a joke. OOoooh, he will \\"polite\\" <BR>James Bond to death. His menacing video game was the most IGNORANT<BR>thing I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Oohh <BR>the \\"suspense\\" of it! Just watch the obvious closeups of Kim Basinger <BR>during this sequence for proof of the \\"suspense\\"! Truly a joke if I <BR>have ever witnessed one!<br />All in all, I cannot recommend this dribble to anyone! NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN, maybe Mr. Connery should have <BR>said NEVER when asked to do this! This is the stinker of all Bond films. Stay away from it at all costs!
B00005T30L|3.0|Yeah - fun movie - may be more endearing if you have a large need to be &quot;different&quot; (if you feel intolerance towards the all the world's morons mentioned above).  There is no shame in discovering commonalities with Biff and Hap - try not to be your own little perfect creature - K?.  Buscemi adds enough to keep the movie.  Running off on a bus becomes an appropriate non-ending (who thought that one up?).  The BIG THRILL on this disc is the 'mod-gone-wild' 60's stylin Indian Song and Dance Video - that extra is worth the movie ten fold!  Should be twice the price So, if you were disappointed - check the bonus, before you march it off to the flea market!!
B000089RVX|5.0|this cd is so amazing.  amy lee has the most beautiful voice i have heard in very long time.  she uses her voice to the full extent.  you can literaly feel the emotion coming from her voice.  it is so amazing.  there is no other way to describe this cd and amy lee's angelic voice.  if you do not have this cd buy it now.  you will not regret it.
B000002H97|5.0|&quot;I'll give you my Porsche if this album sells 10 million&quot;; frank words from lead guitarist Kirk Hammett to the band's manager show Metallica's lack of confidence in this album.  Why they weren't confident I will never understand.  &quot;The Black Album&quot; is by far one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded by Metallica, if not by anyone.  The metal quartet managed to find a way to blend modern rock (modern rock of '91) and 80's thrash metal in a way few other bands could.  In this crossover album, Metallica went from composing garage-band type rock with expressive guitar solos in songs like Master of Puppets to popular rock using catchy melodies, shorter songs, and simpler structure while keeping the melodies hardcore metal.  However, buried deep underneath each song of thrash is a message begging to be heard.  The most popular songs off of the album &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Sad But True&quot;, and &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; display some of Metallica's best songwriting and lyrics they've ever concocted.  Not only does &quot;Metallica&quot; prove that mainstream metal doesn't always mean a sellout, it proves that any band, if they work hard enough, can change their image to some degree.  Metallica learns the hard way after a long break from each other that too much image-transformation can lead to poor album production like &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Re-Load&quot;.  Now back to Hammett's Porsche comment, the album surpassed the 10 million mark in early '96, and sure enough, Hammett forfeited his prized vehicle.
B000089RVX|5.0|Truely spectacular vocals from a superb singer, backed by a <BR>brilliantly executed piano and guitar accompaniment. The <BR>highlights on this album are definately 'Bring me to Life'<BR>and 'My Immortal', bot of which were featured on the Daredevil film.<BR>This is a perfect album for those who like Rock, Alternative,<BR>Grunge, Gothic music, its a perfect blend of everything.<BR>A must have!
