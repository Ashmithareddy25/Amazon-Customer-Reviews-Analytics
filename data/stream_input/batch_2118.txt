0525953728|4.0|I finished this book in two days. It's a great read and an amazing story. I have to admit that I'm a skeptic of covert guys that thrust themselves--and at the same time their family and friends and teammates--into the spotlight but this was a story that needed to be told. After reading the book I read the Esquire article (Feb. '13) which details the same mission (albeit in fewer pages) from the #2 guy in the stack who actually shot UBL in the face. It's a must-read article, BTW. My only gripe with this book, after reading the Esq article, is that the author pays very little homage to the true shooter. Kind of a minor gripe, but that was the crux of the mission. \\"Owen\\" pens more words about the rounds he put into a dead man's chest than about his teammate who actually killed the guy. Oh well, an amazing tale and gripping. 4/5 stars.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I am a full grown adult and I watched this movie with my 14-year old son. We both loved it! Great storyline and lots of laughs.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I just read this as my Book Club pick.  It was unanimous that we all enjoyed reading the book and found it well written.  We did not agree on whether we liked the author as a person even though all admired her courage and determination.  I was one of the few that did like her.  I could totally understand how losing a mother and family could send a 22 year old down a self-destructive path.<br /><br />The most enjoyable part of the book was her adventure.  We all had hoped for more details on what she experienced on the trail.  That would have earned 5 stars instead of 4.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I am not into action movies, but my teenager wanted to watch this. It was surprisingly good, although the plot is very hard to follow.
0062020897|5.0|This is a must-read book!!  With World War II as an integral part of the plotting,  Follett does a superb job of developing his characters and developing the plot!  Masterful!!!  I read the e-book format.

B00AOCLWF6|4.0|go  a chance to see it on TV......... Prime Let me watch the 1st season in 1 day and it was awesome.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thought it an intelligent exploration of the human desire for freedom, at any costs.  Although a work of fiction, the suppression of the &#34;Capitol&#34; and its eventual downfall shows the destiny of any regime the treats its subjects, or even a portion of its subjects, as worthless beings.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It sounds very good and I would recomend Amazon Mp3 download as a way of getting the songs you want.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a while.  Not only is it a compelling love story, but there was a bit of suspense that kept you turning the page.  I will definatly read this book again!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it helps time fly and is just all around fun. Subway surfers deserves five stars. Some daily missions seem tough but if you save enough you can beat them.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I love TinTin and have read all the comics as I was in school overseas with my family some 20 years ago. That said I already was in love with the comic well before this movie came out and enjoyed it more on my TV at home in HD than I did in the theater! I mean really, it was like I was on the ship with them and you forgot it was even animated because it was so spectacular!<br /><br />As far as the film itself, action packed, adventurous and mystery always are in abundance when TinTin comes calling! Great for kids, or the big kid in you! LOVED IT!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Mr. Connelly always creates a crime story that keeps his readers coming back for more.  I especially like the Harry Bosch character.  Keep on writing, Michael!!

B0094BB4TW|2.0|This is an issue that Facebook seems to have with all of its apps, irrespective of the device.  Far too many force close instances, times when the app will freeze or bot respond, or only loads portions of feeds.  The UI does seem to be very streamlined and easy to navigate.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Being the last book in the series, I expected all of the story lines to be wrapped; however, that was not the case; it just left me hanging. It's almost as though there's going to be a Book Six, which I will probably not read. Each of the books was very big.<br />The storyline bogged down in several places in the book, almost to the point where I didn't finish reading it.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how good this ended up. This was an excellent movie with great actors and actresses. I thought Shia did well, but  was out shined by Tom Hardy.
B003L77G10|4.0|I liked Julianna Margulies in her ER series and find her entertaining in this series. I like the twists and the way all the characters seem to share the spot light at some point
B00574Q7PQ|3.0|It was the typical thriller.  It did have a surprise ending though.  Some of the movie was pretty dumb. Good acting though
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game and graphics I even like it even better that the first hit game called Temple Run EVEN THOUGH I LOVE THAT TOO!

0393327345|5.0|Review Essay of \\"Fight Club\\" by Chuck Palahniuk<br />Some major themes in modern society are love, purpose, and defining oneself. Chuck Palahniuk captures all of this and more in his uniquely humorous and uncomfortably dark work, Fight Club. On the surface, the book seems to be an ode to violence, but the violence itself is a means and not an end for the narrator and Tyler Durden, who starts as the narrator's friend, and comes to consume his life and the world around him. What keeps you reading is not only the interesting characters, who are relatable and repellent at the same time, but Palahniuk's unique writing style. His re-use of phrases at key points in the story and intentionally recurring themes keep elements tied together in a weird kind of continuity, making a web within the story that helps connect everything over time and still surprise you along the way.<br />The interesting thing about the book is how Palahniuk begins chapters into a topic, then explains why things are as they are as the chapter goes on. From the narrator's attendance at terminal illness support groups (which he uses to treat his crippling insominia), to when he meets Tyler, and the beginnings of the Fight Club itself, he starts at a point, and almost works backwards and around again each time, using your curiosity to pull you in and along in each chapter, which can almost stand alone. Phrases are repeated throughout the book, but not in a bad way; the words remain the same and are relevant to the context in each different situation, almost becoming idioms in and of themselves (\\"Sometimes Tyler speaks for me\\", \\"If I could wake up in a different place ... could I wake up as a different person?\\"). All of these are at first seeming like random thoughts, stream of consciousness, but as the book moves forward, you see that they are a form of foreshadowing to different events along the way. Even the rules of Fight Club come back in and tie things together, weaving that fabric of the story in its back-and-forth method. This includes the narrator, who isn't specifically named, but may be referred to Joe, after a part in the beginning in Tyler's house he's squatting in, where he had stacks of old Reader's Digests. One had an article about the human anatomy, referring to the organs by name \\"\\"I am Joe's liver\\", and so on. This theme returns over and over in different places (\\"I am Joe's broken heart\\", and \\"I am Joe's Boiling Point\\"), tying chapters together.<br />The characters themselves are unique people, Joe is Everyman, the guy who isn't sure what to do with life, and is doing what he thinks he has to, because he has no idea what he wants to do with it. Tyler is his antipode, in his \\"everything blonde sort of way\\". Tyler, to Joe, is everything he wants to be. Marla is the nexus of the love triangle, Joe cannot stand her, and hates her, but his friend Tyler gets involved in a torrid relationship with her which helps drive a wedge between them. The Fight Club is more than guys beating each other - it, like Joe's earlier trips to support groups, is a catharsis where people step outside their lives and have that visceral moment their world lacks, to set them right and get them through. It's morphing into Project Mayhem and sweeping the country represents the desire of society to shed off this civilization and go back to something simpler, which Tyler wants to bring about through acts of deliberate anarchy.<br />The book on the surface sounds like a guy's romance novel of sorts, and I suppose it is. It's about Joe and how he reconciles his feelings for Marla, and about growth as a person and knowing what you want from life, finding your place and coping with it all. Personally, I found it to be an engaging book that I can read over and over and not get tired of. The characters are darkly funny, the dialogue (internal and external) is witty, and there's that awful element of humanity Mr. Palahniuk knows how to tap into and show you something about yourself.its back-and-forth method.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I am always fascinated by different perspectives on beliefs and the why and why not of life.  This book delivers a new twist on all of this.
B003O5MOES|5.0|When I am not listening to EStreet radio, it is on in the truck.  As always, Bruce hits us hard and makes us reflect
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I wasn't the worst book I've read, but it was a little too 50 shades of grey to be consider as a nice book... we all know how is it going to develop but it's not necessary to be SOOO obvious!<br />I don't want to give a bad critic either, because i could actually read it from begining to end. I'ts a 4/10.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Extremely well acted, attention to detail and period (late 19th century, England), beautiful cinematography and great stories. Lark Rise is a small, working class (almost peasant) hamlet and Candleford, the nearest village/town. I call it a soap only as it pertains to the way the individual story-lines are told, but unlike American soaps, most episodes have some sort of closure to the story. They are stories of simple folk caught in the folds of change as it pertains to the coming of a new modern, era. I have yet to read the books on which the series was based, but I understand from other reviews the series is a faithful adaptation for the most part, although somewhat highly stylized in some cases. Absolutely worth every moment spent watching this delightful series.
B00006674X|5.0|You can't go wrong with Elvis. You through Mary Tyler Moore in the mix and it's well worth the purchase price.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|When I saw the cheesy title I wasn't too sure on what to expect.  I was very pleasantly surprised .... I totally enjoyed this book!!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book has a lot of the elements of the original(The lightning thief )funny exciting unpredictable great read. On top of that it deals with the necessary \\"Coming of age\\" issues which are required in a book of this type. A great read.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Great follow up book!  I loved Delirium and Pandemonium was also a great read.  I can't wait for the next one!
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|We have been rewatching this show as a family with my 9 and 12 year old daughters.<br />They love it. There are a few episodes from the showtime days which you need to filter out for content (Hathor) but all in all good  func sci fi for everyone.<br />They are really getting into the character development of the show and enjoying the interplay between characters.<br />DW and I are also enjoying watching the episodes again and rediscovering why we enjoyed it so much the first time.<br />Definitely one of the best sci-fi series ever
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Temple Run is great! Its a lot of fun and I enjoy it much more than Temple Run 1!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Another book that has given me a new point of view. I wish Kindle was around 20 years ago. Everyone could get something out of this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Would gladly strangle Thomas, if only to stop him from mumbling while smoke pours out of his mouth, nose and ears (not really).  You're supposed to hate him and Mrs. O'Brian and I'm having no trouble doing so.  The acting is great, the costumes terrific and the Abbey mind-boggling.
B00003CXXM|5.0|All three of the films in this trilogy (I understand a fourth is in the works) are superb actioners, but they are sequential; so if you haven't seen them yet, by all means start with this one. This is the only one directed by Doug Liman, who performs masterfully behind the camera; although he is the executive producer for the two follow-on films. This is of course based on the Robert Ludlum novel; and having read the novel many years ago, I do see some familiar reference points...the plotline, however, has been radically changed and updated. Please, no whiny complaints that this is not a faithful adaptation of a favorite novel. The screenplay, as written by Tony Gilroy, is intelligent and portrays a compelling and mostly believable espionage story. The only part that strained my credulity meter a bit was the clandestine obfuscation and confusion regarding the CIA black ops operation called &#34;Treadstone&#34;. Perhaps it will be clearer to you than it was to me. Matt Damon was an inspired choice as the title character, Jason Bourne; as was Franka Potente, as his partner and love interest, Marie. Don't know what film some other reviewers were watching, but I saw excellent chemistry between the two...the romantic aspects are downplayed in favor of character development and action...which is fine w/me. Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are excellent as CIA management operatives...Cooper as head of Treadstone and Cox as his supervisor. Also look for Julia Stiles who plays a CIA logistics technician and Clive Owen, who plays one of the assassins sent after Bourne. Bottom line, this is a top drawer actioner and carries my highest recommendation
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a story full of illusions, history and love. It was beautifully written and captured me right from the start. A great read with a truly satisfying ending! So many books seem to stop without a real conclusion and Erin Morgenstern completely exceeded my expectations.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|2013-02-12
3551354014|5.0|I ordered this product and it arrived in only six days. I was really surprised at how quickly it arrived in the mail. It is in perfect condition and I am completely satisfied with my book. Completely excited to read it!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This a great thinking game. It's a little tough to play on a smart phone screen as you get to the larger puzzles, but still doable. I highly recommend this game.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Drizzt is one of fantasy's greatest hero's. In this story you learn of his home and his beginnings in the the evil Drow Homeland.  I would highly recommend this book and others in this ten+ book series, especially if you are a fan LOTR, or any other fantasy series.  This is the father of them all
B009EEMMWW|4.0|cute, good story line.  love penelope cruz,  made me hungry. worth the time to watch it. especially loved the singing
B00005YW4H|5.0|What can ya say about Nora? Smooth!, relaxing yet motavating. Just plan good. MMM Good. A must for every collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A compelling existential drama that leaves one asking what is behind the thin veil of civilized humanity?  This.  Watch it.  These are not big-name actors, but their talent is undeniable.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I am glad I checked on Amazon before heading down to the Verizon store.  I had been seeing the Moto Razr M on their website for 49.99, but when I went into the store about a week later, the price was 99.99.  I told them Amazon had it for 49.99 still and they were able to verify it online.  They would not price match, so I came home and purchased from Amazon and saved $50!<br /><br />There was one glitch in the ordering process through Amazon, I needed a pin that I didn't have.  I was able to log into my Verizon account online and figure it out.  After that, the process was smooth, the phone showed up quickly and I was up and running licketty split.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wanted to read the book before the movie and I'm glad I did. The book helped me understand the movie so much better and I loved every minute of it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this book was boring at the begging and started to get better towards the middle then it had me hooked at the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the bomb I wish I had this only had this game and that I wish I new about this game earier
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I love this flash.  I have used it to take simple pictures of my child, to shoot weddings, and portraits in the park.  This flash works beautifully and provides excellent lighting when used properly.  It does run hot with shots in quick succession.  My understanding is this problem comes from hot batteries and can be alleviated with an external flash battery.<br /><br />Despite that I would recommend to anyone who can wants to take great pictures where the on camera flash just isn't cutting it anymore.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|The melodies, the words, the rhythms, the arrangements -- this album is still the best I've ever heard. The added material at the end illustrates how the final arrangements are so much more powerful than the early ones. The project came together ultimately and lovingly.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter told me about this game and it is awesome. Sucks you in and you totally lose track of time. Daughter scored almost a million so the new life mission is to beat her high score!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I'll be honest, nothing in this book is rocket science. It was,however, a really effective tool for me to organize my thoughts. I really enjoyed most if the book. It was a quick read, it makes sense, and I particularly like the end of chapter questions and tasks. It's never a bad idea to check in on your relationship. This was a great tool to do just that.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I play this fairly regularly. Only issue I have is when you play bonus words with alot of coins it freezes on the Kindle. Think it is a compatibility issue with the browser. Lots of fun!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The plot line was a little weak.  Not one of my favorites and not one I would be excited about watching a second time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have this app on my Kindle and my iPhone. I love that I can reference back to one place without scrolling through 800 bookmarks. Now you can even &#34;Pin&#34; on a private board! Awesome!
B0090EKRKU|5.0|They loved it at the theater; they liked it at Grandma's as well.  I thank you for the oppportunity for it to be available.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm 'so hooked! Can't get my hands on Mockingjay fast enough! I really hope the final chapter of this series is worth my time!I do not want to be disappointed!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great way to waste time. My 7 year old loves it and we compete for high scores! Great down load!
B005HSL626|2.0|this game has too many comercials in between the boards or even after when your game is over.  full version doesnt have this.
B000HVHM5S|5.0|This movie made alot of sense to me as an individual. It is not for someone who is looking for a dumbed up action flick. I think it is awesome!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|The game was fun for a while but it gets old fast.  Its the same board every time just seems faster.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I spent the first 3 hours I had this playing it. I like it even more than Angry Birds! Wonderful way to waste time and just challenging enough to keep you entertained!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has great graphics. And it is so much fun. I sometimes let my guy get hit just to see them get flipped.!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have had Facrbook for years., I hardly ever update my statuses and use it as more of a chat service! It is a good way to keep in touch with long distance friends and family.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was the first book I read by Jojo Moyes and I was captivated. I wanted to read more by Jojo Moyes. I have since read The Last Letter From Your Lover,equally captivating. I have recommended it to my friends who enjoy a good read.

B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun and it is fast. Got to stay away from the bombs or you will be starting over and over.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked Mocking Jay just as much as the other two.  I am a physician and the writing about the multiple depressions the characters face because of the horror they endured was wonderful.  Drugs can make you feel physically better and, for a minority, make your mental illness feel better.  The ending was action-packed and unexpected.  I flipped the pages as fast as I could to see what would happen next.  This book is awesome!
B007N85POS|5.0|This is a fun and sometimes challenging game to free all the birds. This is a fun game with good graphics.
B004E547D8|5.0|This movie is on of our staples for movie night.  It has just enough action for my husband and enough romantic interest for me all while being light and comical for both of us.  If you're looking for a not too serious movie this is it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is really awesome and the graphics are great. This game takes some patience until you get the hang of it because it is kinda fast paced.
0920668372|5.0|If you have children and have never read this book you need to.  It's a wonderfully touching story (although a bit unrealistic) and has me crying every time I reach the last page or two.  This classic should be in every child's library.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is fun and alittle challenging at first to figure out how to hit what you need to hit. But it is like the other it is fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so addicting its cool cause you can unlock different characters to run and there is a big demon monkey and ziplines and minecarts I love it!
B001AUEMFS|5.0|This is my absolute favorite song of all time. I catch myself singing it alot of the time. It is Great.

B00AFEXRME|5.0|Excellent story, Denzel is an amazing actor as always . This movie truly makes you think .<br />Granted the accident is not his fault what so ever  (sorry if you didn't see this yet!) but you have to get this movie
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|this game is fun but it feels like when you are playing it that it needs something else. It needs a little more action
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I got this for someone as agift but was able to view it with them ! I am not into scifi's but the story grabbed ya
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this game is so much fun and addicting. It is a good game to help you relax and play with your kids.
0316044695|1.0|Maybe to civilians who never saw what real fight is, or what what happens after you get wounded, but to someone who had these kinda experiences Rambo movies sound more believable. It's easy to say whatever since no one was around to witness. Someone doesn't get his guts blown out and than jumps down the mountain and keeps fighting. Being shot four times ?? Mortal head wound?? I had to stop reading . Its just doesn't make any sense. This is a second book that was written by a seal and complete waste of money for me . Never again
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The original UK version of Season 2 is an outstanding uncut product. I would highly recommend any fan of Downton Abbey to consider this version.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good graphics with an interesting story. Great hints for newbies like me. At $4.99 it was a little more expensive than I like but I was hooked after playing the free chapters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A great series and a great way to see it.  I'm really pleased and would buy it again, can't wait for season 3.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The tiles are a good size. Would like them a tad bigger, but game is easy and it is good training to keep the eye and brain working together. Play it often.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|I love the vintage looking cover.  Fits my Samsung galaxy tab 2 nicely.  Soft inside to keep tablet scratch free.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|LOVE this show.  Good story lines; excellent acting; great intrigue.  Look forward to each new season.  Wish it was on more often.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|I bought this series because a friend told me it was great.  I'm hating myself that I waited this long to get on the band wagon.  The cast is amazing!  Katey Sagal is such a great actress!  I know, Peg Bundy, but seeing her as Gemma really lets you know how fantastic of an actress this lady really is.  A must see of a show.  I can't wait to start Season 2.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|My grand daughter and I really enjoy this game.  Really makes us think.  Great color and movement.  Thank you alot.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|Everything about this works. Superb songs, fascinating and unique production, and every note delivered with absolute conviction in a KILLER groove. Good as it gets.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great calculator didn't want anything crazy just something that I could use for quick calculations. instead of buying a real calculator why not get one free and its a big size since its the full size of the kindle which is a plus definately would recommend it.
0345529057|5.0|I Got my books so quickly and they are great and very affordable! What an awesome boxed set. It was really a wonderful experience.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very entertaining and funny is places. Would be an interesting predicament. I don't usually read this kind of romance, but the story line was interesting.
B0026PW67W|4.0|It's just awesome to be able to hold that in my hands. Unsurprisingly, it is not exactly like the one in the movie. A little more disappointing, though, is it's not really an effective map. But it's still so cool! It has little fold out things and you can see some classroom and hallways and such so it still feels like I'm one step closer to finding Hogwarts. :)
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I loved the book. I am very much an introvert. I have alot of trouble with idle chit chat. If I have something specific to talk about I am ok but small talk unnerves me. My only problem with the boook is once I got to 69% done it was all credits and extra stuff from there.  The book also started with alot of credits and added information. This is a book I actually paid $12.99 for. Probably still would have bought it anyways though. I really liked the part in church where everybody had to introduce themselves to everyone else and shake hands. I know that practice is well meaning, but I don't like it at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if u were board and didn't know what game to get,.... get this one. this one has great acres and is super fun....

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It made me laugh out loud in my quiet house. I the characters are well written and really drew me in.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I love James Bond all of the movies but this is by far one of the best I have ever seen! The story and acting are right on and bring a different tone to the movie just one of the best bonds out there!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|You can play many sounds, and easily switch between them.  There are many sounds on the website that are easy to search through and download.
B001C46P2K|5.0|There is so much I could say about this movie but I can sum it all up by saying just watch it!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|We love my horse. It's fun to play and always different. Played by a seven year old and a forty year old.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This touch bacpac really turns your GOPRO into a digital camera or a HD camcorder.  You can use it as your family camera for all occasions.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I didn't know what to expect...but I'm pleasantly pleased.  The book was pretty good.  Enough twists and turns to keep it interesting and not too obvious as to the outcome.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Confusing but fun, need more info in help menu.  Power ups need to happen more often and more weapons but lots of fun and its free.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game was better than I thought. if there were six stars that wouldn't be enough for this app I play all the time.give it a medal nothing less than gold or you'll be lowing.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The lessons of this book are still with  us today as we try and live virtuous lives in service of others.
B002LL1686|1.0|This is a great movie I've seen several times, however the copy I purchased from this seller has the regional code for somewhere other than the United States and I was unable to play the disks on any of my devices.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|AMAZING HAVE BEEN HOOKED SINCE DAY ONE. MY 4&5 yr OLD LOVE IT JUST AS MUCH AND THEY HAVE MASTERED IT.  GREAT WAY TO KILL TIME.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Almost as good as 50 Shades of Gray, if you became hooked like I did then this should be your next read.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Beautifully written,creatively imaginative descriptions of a magical circus at the turn of the century. The love story is told in a way, that despite the switching from year to year and speaker to speaker, it held my attention all the way through.
B00846REIS|5.0|This series is a great series to read especially after the 50 shades series. I would highly recommend this series.
B00846F1YW|4.0|You have challenging but not impossible tasks.<br />The storyline is interesting.<br />You have self-recharging hints.<br />There are also other riddles like anagrams and find the differences.<br />Find the differences can be solved quickly if you know how to view stereograms with the unaided eye by crossing your eyes - the differences will scintillate.<br />However, if you pan around or zoom, you'll get false taps.<br />This doesn't seem to matter because you don't get penalties for them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is a great series to read. I would highly recommend this series.  It will keep you up at night.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Find this version of the to be the best of all I have tried. Playing goes smoothly and without annoyances as in others.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very intelligent and sensitive. Could not stop reading it. Will probably be watching the movie as well. Highly recommended! Enjoy.
0394818237|5.0|My grandson loves this older (and harder to find) edition of this book.  Although it was expensive, I am glad that I bought it.
B009IJJ5B4|2.0|I did not enjoy this but my significant other, male, did. Sherlock talks very quickly and I find him hard to understand. The Dr. Watson character seems amaciated and timid. She is not a character I warm to. This Sherlock is even more quirky than others.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Sucks you in to their lives and you can't wait to see what happens next.  Awesome to see all the new inventions come to life.
0307742997|4.0|On the first snow of winter, a woman goes missing.  Only one trace of her remains, a pink scarf draped around a snowman that mysteriously appeared in the yard earlier that day.  Inspector Harry Hole suspects there is a link between the missing woman and a letter he's received.  The case deepens when a pattern emerges over the past decade; eleven women have vanished, all on the day of first snow.<br /> Nesbo skillfully weaves in the back story of these missing women by individual chapters as the mystery unfolds.  The events are correlated with the election of U. S. presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, a technique that gives the author an opportunity to make some humorous comments about our country.<br /> Harry Hole has a new partner, an attractive young woman detective from Bergen named Katrine Bratt.  There's considerable sexual tension as Katrine is attracted to Harry but he's not interested.  He's still carrying the torch for Rakel who is now in a relationship with a doctor named Mathias.  But somehow, Rakel can't get Harry out of her life for two reasons.  Harry has formed a strong bond with Oleg, her son.  The other problem is that Rakel keeps coming back.  As Katrine tells Harry, \\"Once you have fantastic sex, you have to keep coming back for more.\\"<br /> Harry and Katrine begin making grizzly discoveries of the missing women plus  other related victims.  They think they've discovered the identity of the snowman but surprises keep popping up.  Like me, you probably won't be able to figure it out until you get to the last pages and have to keep going until the very end.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I'm usually not inthralled with science fiction but this series has just the tight mixture! I'm now on the fourth season and am already anxious about its eventual end.  It has great writing, acting, and suspense. Love the actors and I am very surprised that the show has not gotten more notoriety.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great book!  This is a book for all age groups.  Easy reading, great adventures, always keeping you on the edge so that you have to keep reading!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is my 3rd reading, and it is better every time. I gain new insights with each reading. Card is in a class of his own.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Very enjoyable but confusing if one is interested in history and know the background. It is another point of view; more in keeping with the Richard III that was just recently aired on BBC.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Cream is one of those classic British rock bands that came around really quickly and just as quickly disappeared.  If you were to look back at the history of British rock, I think you would see Eric Clapton's name attached to a great deal of these here today, gone tomorrow bands.<br /><br />Cream just happened to be one that sticks out and that never came back, in any form over the years.<br /><br />That's why when Cream announced some shows in London and some shows in New York City, this was a huge deal.<br /><br />Cream's music or impression was one of psychedelic sounds or what have you, but really they are driven by blues riffs and Clapton's guitars.  The rhythm section is worldclass and in concert they can jam.<br /><br />Because these were one off shows, not to be repeated, I imagine the thought that went into laying down these concerts was extensive and that comes through in the quality of the sound on these recordings.<br /><br />If you are a Clapton fan, or a Cream fan, you will really enjoy this album.  If you are a fan of rock or various kinds of music, this is a really good introduction to one of the 60's influential bands.
B0091REZMW|4.0|pretty good so far, haven't been playing long :-) still looking for the most awesome strategy game....if anyone knows let me know.
0316666343|4.0|At the time I must have only been 25-26 and I read this book to have an impressive discussion with a girl.  But it actually ended up being a fascinating book and not at all chick lit-ty.
0307719774|5.0|This book is a great journal to read and look back at.  I got this as a gift for my wife and she loves it.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I was definitely compelled to keep reading this book, seeking the explanation of the mystery.  But somehow, when it was done, I felt &#34;eh&#34;.  The writing was fine, easy to digest, it had a definitive style.  But the characters and the story line had a malaise about them that never lifted, even through the resolution.  I'm hopeful that Flynn wove that mood on purpose, and then I would be impressed.  But I'm wondering if it was an accidental product of underdeveloped/unlikeable characters, a minorly predictable ending, and events that were just a bit too fantastical.  I'd have to read another work from Flynn to really make a decision, and I probably will.
B007HO392S|5.0|An American Idol. Carrie Underwood never disappoints. It's great when I buy a CD and love more than the title song!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I enjoyed the book so much that it was read in a day an half.  I love books that deal with military and crime.  Wonderful author and his books are definitely worth reading.
B000000OF6|5.0|It's Queen, I mean, how much can I really say about one of classic rock's most talented bands? Freddy Mercury was a god, RIP
1848566980|5.0|All those pulp SciFi paperbacks you had when you were a kid - well chances are that Chris Foss created the artwork for those covers. Create trip down memory lane. Book itself is perfect. It is substantial and good quality, decent size images. If I knew a friend who shared my passion I would certainly buy them a copy.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I first heard Thrift Shop online and fell in love because of his catchy lyrics and style.  I can relate to his message about thrifitng to get around being &#34; tricked by business&#34; & because IM a fellow thrifter ;)<br />I also loved his messages of positivity and love, which are so rarely found in rap now a days.<br />I found his style, voice, and lyrics very refreshing. I also deeply respect him stepping out into the political cross hairs with &#34;Same Love&#34;, standing up for equal rights.<br />One of my top favorite artists now. Hope he has much success and will be around!
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Steve Moffats writing really plays to the strengths of Matt Smith (the eleventh Doctor) and companion duo. The Ponds (and yes I know Rory is Williams but keep up) really play off the Doctors new character and almost provide a foil to his eccentricity. There is a nice crescendo leading up to the series finale which has a bit of slapstick to it. All in all a worthy addition to the Doctor Who franchise.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|By far this has to be the best book coauthored by Mark Greaney. He and Tom Clancy knock it out of the park yet again!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game. at first it wouldn't load. but it got better I just had to delete it and then down load ot again. I lime showing g the horses and I like combing their hair!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As I started to read I considered putting the book down on more than one occasion...it didn't quite feel right, but as you continue and give the book a chance the characters really start to attach themselves to you.  I ended up thoroughly enjoying the book!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I like getting wrapped up in a book until I can't put it down until I'm done with it.  This was one of those books but the subject matter was way too intense for my likes.  I read to feel happy and this book didn't do that for me.  It was good but a story dealing with child molestation and suicide do not produce \\"happy\\" feelings.  I skipped over parts because I wanted to finish the book but didn't want it dragging me down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is the perfect ending to the trilogy although it definitely left me wanting to learn more about their lives.  I read the trilogy in a weekend - it was that good!!!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I would advise anyone to grab a copy of this as I'm going to call it a period piece and one to have in your collection .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a great read - although at times I could've done without all the sex scenes - sometimes it felt as if they consumed too much of the book!!!  I fell in love with the characters here in this book however and felt compelled to continue reading...I couldn't put the book down - read it in about 3 hours!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love this movie. I've been looking for it for weeks and finally found it. The passion in the acting and in the music is so breathtaking that you can't watch it only once. This movie helped me discover my love for Emmy Rossum and her voice. Overall, this movie I would recommend to anyone who was in look of a mysterious experience with a phantom of the dark.
B00B5HQL50|2.0|I actually liked the first part of the movie but as it dragged I could tell the director started to just throw things in without packaging it the way it was from the beginning. It started out well, and thinned out. Even the climatic end was compared to other Bond movies, mediocre at best. They tried so hard to focus on getting back to old school that they literally went back in time.
B008M7JODC|4.0|Over all I enjoyed the series.  The over arching story is interesting and leads to compelling moments.  Like any new series it suffers from times that seems like it is unsure where it is going.  Also there are times when the plot seems forced.  The characters are slowly developing their personalities and characteristics throughout the first season. The main characters while sometimes suffering from &#34;common archetype syndrome&#34; do seem to blend well with their interactions with each other.  If you are a fan of Lost or X-files then you will probably find the series enjoyable.  The series relies heavily on mysterious events and conspiracy to move it along.  It also works to leave the viewer guessing as to what truly is going on.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Won't even open.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this trash.<br /><br />Amazon should pull this app now if it has any standards.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Like playing the game...needs more elementary details in the description of how to play and what you can and can't do.
B005KP77WE|5.0|I like this version of Miracle on 34th Street better than the one before it mainly because of Richard Attenbourg or as I like to refer to him Mr. Hammon from Jurassic Park.  &#34;Spared no Expense&#34;.  This is a great holiday movie.  The only problem is after Christmas it stays on the self the rest of the year.  Great family movie!
1616550414|5.0|I have several publications related to the Legend of Zelda and let me tell you, this is the best so far. The quality of the pages, the hard cover and the contents are superb. I have to be honest though, the time line is more than a bit confusing. I guess I had made up my mind that each was some sort of a separate story that had the same themes (ala parallel universe sort of thing). Anyway, the art and inside information alone are reasons enough for any Legend of Zelda Fan to NOT miss this book! I wish I had the leather-bound edition...
B0013ND30W|4.0|I have a great love for Disney.  Ive been more times than I can count.  I remember watching this as a kid.  Now as an adult its different because of my perspective.  Its a little sappy with a princess and prince and talk of true love and all but something about it stuck with me from childhood.  The way i see it I like it enough and I got it now for my children.  Great family movie!
B00B01XDTI|1.0|The title I wrote really sums up this poorly written and casted sequel to a great and innovative horror movie \\"Silent Hill\\" which is one of my all time favorites.  This was a cheaply done and very poor attempt to create new revenue based on the fact its part of that succesful storyline.  Unfortunately it falls so short, that its actually easy to fall asleep while watching it.<br /><br />Gone are the all creatively made demons and fractured humans skulking about, unless of course you count the old costumes from the original they reused in some scenes, like the Nurses, and just reshot them all over again, or incorporated CGI which was not used in the original.  In fact, many scenes are just flashbacks to the original.  I can only think of how cheap it must have been to make this movie. My gosh, Alessa is not even Alessa anymore, shes created a new part of her that houses the only good left of her that was not turned into complete evil... STUPID storyline idea!!!!<br /><br />If your desperate enough to return to Silent Hill again, might I offer a MUCH better solution?  Rewatch the original, it will be time far more well spent and you will SAVE YOUR MONEY.  Thanks for reading my review.<br /><br />Mike
B004KKXMSI|4.0|I love Jurassic Park because I love dinosaurs.  Though I am not sure if i believe they actually existed.  Jurassic Park 1 and 2 are great, 3 I am not so sure about but I figured if i got two I should go ahead and get them all.  i had the 3 pack in DVD and was looking forward to the 3 pack in bluray.  These movies stir my imagination.  Pretty good trilogy.
078322611X|3.0|A good movie and Kevin Costner is a wonderful actor, a nice story line with parts that are very touching...
B00542USJW|5.0|I saw this when it came out in theaters and never purchased it.  I remember back then I wasn't a big basketball fan but Im from miami and as an adult am a die hard Heat fan.  I did watch basketball back in Michael's day and I love Looney Tunes to this day.  Great inspirational movie!
B000GFLE1S|4.0|Love the music, the show scenes and story line and fab shoe's they are hot....<br /><br />Nothing drag about drag ....
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I love this movie at Halloween.  The only problem is the rest of the year it says on the self.  I had this in DVD and was looking forward to it in bluray.  Great family movie!
B00AJLHUAS|3.0|This release comes, as Ferry might put it, from \\"out of the blue.\\" It's an intriguing and perhaps bold move that has, I think, mixed results. First of all, whatever else this album may be, it is NOT musically comparable to the virtuosity of Duke Ellington's Washingtonians, or other early jazz legends as some reviewers claim. The arrangement of Love Is The Drug, is clearly modeled on tunes like East St. Louis Toodle-oo--as one reviewer points out. But there's no comparing the respectable retro soloists in The Bryan Ferry Orchestra (with Alan Barnes and other British jazz musicians) to Bubber Miley's plunger-muted trumpet work on the aforementioned Duke classic. Other songs, such as This Is Tomorrow, seem to emulate Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives. It even kicks off with a lone trumpet intro that nods directly to the classic intro to West End Blues. The remainder of the song comes off a bit like an uptempo Hot Fives tune. But the bottom line regarding these comparisons is that there's just no way to recreate the inspired melting pot of  virtuosos and creative geniuses that coalesced in the Harlem of the 1920s.  Legends like Duke, Fletcher Henderson, Don Redman, Bessie Smith,Earl Hines, King Oliver and all the others can be admired from a distance, but never really imitated convincingly. For a tribute to Duke, I would recommend The Vienna Art Orchestra's versions which don't try to imitate the originals as much as breathe new life into them.<br /><br /> Nevertheless, it is very interesting to see how these old Roxy and solo Ferry faves sound when they are processed through retro 20s style jazz as instrumentals. My opinion is that some work much better than others. Love Is The Drug really does work in this context, while the haunting melodies of This Island Earth are only diminished in comparison to the original 70s solo Ferry version. The rigid meter and dynamically flat contours of the remake here just don't flatter it, imo. I was really interested to see how The Bogus Man (one of Roxy's more avant-garde efforts) would work as 20s-style jazz. It is probably the most adventurous reworking on the album. It sounds a bit surreal-- pleasantly anachronistic. This may be due to the melodic and harmonic aspects of the song, which don't resemble anything from the 20s jazz legends--even the adventurous Duke Ellington in that period. But for that reason it sounds experimental and, to me, compelling. Anyway, these are my impressions, and an album like this is sure to excite some and disappoint others. The songs themselves are great, the playing here is quite accomplished (not brilliant or anything) and the album gives fans a chance to re-imagine Ferry's output from the 70s classics to recent material. I'm sure it will divide listeners, but I found it worthwhile as a diehard Ferry/Roxy fan.n (one of Roxy's more avant-garde efforts) would work as 20s-style jazz.

B005IA9JZO|5.0|This movie is great.  I saw it once when I was a little boy.  Now as an adult it still captures my imagination.  This movie is great for one reason because Robin Williams is funny in this movie and not necessarily a goof ball like he is in others.  Great family movie!
0425263916|5.0|Read the first book in less than a week, and same with this one! I cannot get enough of the plot. It keeps you wanting more. the 1st is def. the best. I preordered the 3rd 6 months before it comes out because I cannot WAIT to find out what happens!
B00198X0VS|5.0|I was in elementary school when MIB came out and all my friends and I wished for a sequel to the movie.  I got my wish with MIB 2.  This is a great movie.  I love Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.  Great movie!
0425263908|5.0|I love this book. It is better than what I expected! I am NOT a reader, and read this in less than a week because I couldn't put the book down! Keeps you wanting more from the series. I preordered the second book before it came out, and after reading the second, i have preordered the THIRD! def. reccommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! the twists and turns along with the stairs and new temples! I enjoy playing it a lot
0525478817|5.0|What a great book. I was looking to start reading again, and picked up this one because I heard of the positive reviews. It was so much better than I expected. I read it in less than 5 days because i literally could NOT put it down! I laughed quite often, and cried probably the same amount, and I love when books can do that to the reader. This is a fabulous book and I recommend it to anyone!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Yeah... I finally succumbed to the 'Fifty Shades' hype... and while I can't say that I didin't enjoy reading it... is not what I thought it was going to be... I think it always happens when you hear over and over again that something is really, really good and... is not thaaat good for all the fuss that is around it...
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I am rereading it before going on to the second book.<br />I am loving it the second time around as much as the first.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My daughter, mom, and I saw this at the theater when it came out and really enjoyed it. One of the best new Disney films!

B00004XPPB|5.0|Johnny Depp is my favorite actor hands down. He has been for about 14 years now! Great movie - if you are a Johnny fan I definitely recommend it. :)
B005PK56TA|5.0|The Story line keep me on the end of my seat! All the characters were so interesting. Each episode keep you wanting to know more.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I really like this song, it's cute. Very pop and bouncy and fun to hear. Heard this at the beach so it always reminds me of the beach now which is always good! :)
0596004966|4.0|This is a handy compact reference for reviewing the many moving parts in C++ - it's definitely not a tutorial, and it doesn't cover the standard library, but for a language reference it does pretty well, covers most important topics.

B0083P1QUM|4.0|Riveting! Very well written. Easy to follow. The ending was totally surprising. One of her best.  As usual Dr Scarpetta's character is fascinating.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game I like how you can change and name your houses<br />Good game too play when there's nothing to do
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Funny, poignant, occasionally goofy...Castle continues to charm, amuse, and delight more than most shows today. Down with Downtown Abbey, long live the quirky shows like Castle or on the side of the spectrum, Justified.
B00821OX98|5.0|I missed a lot of the opening series so i was so glad to be able to start from the beginning and catch up on all the episodes.  Great acting.  Interesting storyline.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is a classic scifi tv show that is a combination of X-Files and Lost.  Walter Bishops character is really fascinating and makes the show.
B008EOVHXI|2.0|yes, the playing, etc. are glorious, but the recording has noise all over it that I thought had disappeared from the digital domain. It is not analog tape hiss -- sounds too rough for that -- and it is not background hall noise -- way too loud for that.  Unless my copy is unique, it is an unprofessional disgrace to offer this as a professional effort.  Anybody have similar results?

B008KE3960|5.0|Great take on the tower Defense game. Could get frustrating at times, but once you've figured out the game plan it's extremely gratifying.
145210655X|5.0|Bought this for my brother-in-law and his wife (which is my sister) who just had a baby boy!  He is Lord of the Star Wars nerds, and I thought that he would enjoy this.  He spent about 15 minutes on Christmas morning reading it, neglecting to open other presents while he was doing so, leading me to believe that he was thoroughly enjoying it.  The animations are cute and the lines from the movies that are put into new scenes with &#34;Darth Vader and Son&#34; are really cute, especially for someone who recognizes that they are in fact, lines from the movie.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A probing look into the realities of alcoholism. Flight is a movie that captures the helpless nature of an addict who must come to terms with the price of his own addictions.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book wasn't at all what I expected, it was so much more. So many unexpected moments. I think I may read it again.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The following is for book 3, but is relevant to the first 2 as well......<br /><br />This book was a waste of time and money. Honestly, I'm not even sure where to start complaining with the irritating nature of this rubbish that Rice calls a book, but here goes: The plot is weak, the pace is rushed, the descriptions are ridiculous, the characters, to paraphrase another reviewer, are cookie cutter outlines with no depth, the fight scenes were lame; also, the actions of the main characters borderline on retarded, and the grammatical errors rampant in this book could be identified by 3rd graders. I tried to like this book, but Rice lost me with the description of the dragon. Granted there were numerous other issues prior to this, but I persevered because I enjoy supporting self-published and indie authors. Seriously, A dragon with feet large enough to make canyons hundreds of feet deep and 50 men long, yet with talons small enough to slice men in half and slam one into the side of the canyon (who manages to live through it)? Do you realize the magnitude of that description? 50 feet by an average height of 5.5 is 275 ft. long....... That would be the equivalent of being hit with something the size of a football field.... Come on now, just because it is a fantasy book doesn't mean it shouldn't make sense. Unless Morgan Rice is a mentally challenged 3rd grader, I will continue to be disappointed with this drivel. I just appreciate the silver lining to this story, and that is the fact that I was able to get a refund for the last two books, and will not buy any more of the crap spewing forth from the tips of Rice's fingers.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|This LEGO set is awesome.  It arrived fast and it was just what I had ordered.  My son is very happy!!
B003YUS3JI|3.0|i have only used it several times and its already looking pretty worn. i think ill stick with sanuk for now.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I have told everyone I know about this amazing book.  I rationed myself a chapter or so a day because I didn't want Mr. Fry's pilgrammage, or my reading of it, to end.  Ms. Joyce triumphed here.
B001B1T7BU|5.0|my grand daughter and I watched this together, she really enjoyed it. It came very fast and I will order more movies for the future
0765325950|1.0|I have been reading this series since the day it first came out 22 years ago. But I will not be reading this final book as I am not going to contribute to its sales numbers.  The author's wife chose not to release it in ebook format and I am not carrying around a hardback for reading.<br /><br />That is her choice and I am making my choice.  I will not support someone that tries to force me into their views.  I don't need her or this book that badly and the publishers should have show more backbone, therefore I will not support either one of them.<br /><br />The sad thing is that I have bought all the previous books in hardback and would have completed the set, but it will not happen now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I wasn't sure about the game but after seeing some of the reviews figured I would give it a go.. very addictive.<br />a must buy.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A good story with twists and turns,  along the same  plot  lines as his other books.<br />A  good read for the beach, a good love story.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Another all-night page turner.<br /><br />She took us from this spectacular world of hidden magic and plunged us into the depths of  ... normality.  This was the darkest book yet.<br /><br />Superb!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Great for all ages. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Good Movie, cheap price. I got it for my brother and he loved it. The service was fast and accurate.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|...original characters beautifully fleshed out in fresh, wickedly-funny and believable dialogue among the page-turning, unexpected twists and turns of  a hopelessly timeless tale of enduring love.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I always enjoy the build up to the finish.<br />I would like to see more of the same. The heat is on
0765325950|3.0|**SPOILERS BELOW**<br /><br />Listen.  I love Brandon Sanderson.  I've read everything he's ever published.  I love Robert Jordan; I've been reading this series since I was 12.<br /><br />But after finishing this book this morning, I have some questions:<br /><br />1) Why would you spend 300ish pages devoted to battles on 4 fronts when their outcome is completely worthless?  Just start the battle at Merrilor and you will have missed NOTHING.<br /><br />2) Why would you devote >100 pages to the battle between Perrin and SLAYER? Slayer is the LEAST interesting villain in the books.  You make Slayer a central character, but give about 2 paragraphs to Lanfear, and 1 to Ordeith/Padan Fain after BOOKS about them.<br /><br />3) Why would you put Elayne in charge of the Light forces, just to hand it over to Mat like we knew she would? That was a useless transition. Maybe have her do something else important, like, oh, hunting the Forsaken or the scores of other important foes we've accumulated over two decades.<br /><br />4) Why do we personally have to read of the gruesome end that befalls EACH and EVERY Trolloc? If there were hundreds of thousands, we read a detailed description of the animal faces of at least half of those before they were swept under by Boar Rushes Down the Mountain, or whatever.<br /><br />5) Did Rand's battle with the Dark One really have to be a set of overdramatic vignettes of \\"possible futures?\\" Who voted for that \\"battle,\\" and the \\"revelation\\" that a world without any evil would be just as false as one without any good?<br /><br />6) What about the Sea Folk? Yes, yes, the Bowl of Winds is kind of important.  Didn't we lose a couple books in there to Sea Folk IMPORTANCE?<br /><br />7) Why introduce the evil Aiel?  That's a lot of exposition... for what? To show that every coin has two sides? Useless.<br /><br />8) Why so much drama about the revolt in the Black Tower?  Great, have Taim recruit Dreadlords, but we don't need to spend so much precioustime on something that eventually pans out to \\"there are some good Asha'man and some bad ones.\\"<br /><br />On the good side, a lot of minor characters are handled well.  Aravine/Vanin/etc is pretty good, though Faile is a distraction.  The dream battles are beautifully crafted, and really spark the imagination in awesome ways. The Seanchan stop being useless twats; their twattery is the only thing that's ever made me consider abandoning the series (yes, not even the dress smoothing and sour faces at spoiled tea got to me).  The Horn heroes and Olver are used well; I only wish there were more of them.<br /><br />Ah, well.  I enjoyed the book insofar as it was a page turner and at least offered SOME conclusion, but I had much higher hopes after the last two books.  As others have pointed out, some denoument would have been nice. I expected AT LEAST 100 pages of it; you can't just leave EVERYTHING hanging except something we already knew -- that Rand wins in the end and the Dark One loses and is sealed back up.  Personally, I'd hoped that Brandon would figure out a more clever end for the Dark One -- holing him up again fits the Wheel concept, but so does something like integration of Darkness _into_ the pattern, such that balance from an outside antagonist isn't necessary.<br /><br />Long story short: if you've read the other ones, you'll be glad for the end.  But you won't necessarily love the machinations that get you there.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|A great love story with characters you can relate to.<br />An easy and worth while read.<br />Thank you for this!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is the best cover I have purchased and also the cheapest.  It is easy to use, my Kindle pops out easily when I want to just hold it.  I loved having the color choices because I love to personalize my electronics.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This season is hilirous. all the relationships are growing. I would even say its better than season 1, Tuesdays need too come quick. ...i wish it was longer than 30 mins. I love it!
B005WBBYXO|4.0|It is interesting that both the hardcover and the paperback are being sold at over 30% discount over buying the three individual titles.  However, if you want to buy the Kindle trilogy then you pay a $1 premium over buying the three titles separately.  Does something seem wrong here?!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Had this on my android phone and is so addictive, so I downloaded it on my kindle to. Love the levels, graphics. Beautiful colors
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this every night. It is my way to relax - preferable to Tv most nights. My grandson now wants to learn to play - he is 4.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This story sucks you in from the beginning! An easy fun read! Heartwarming & made me laugh! Great book :)
B00A196SE2|3.0|I loved Gossip Girl's six seasons. But I think the reason of releasing this box set is ridiculous. Complete series box sets are supposed to be awesome and better enough to make people buy the complete show instead of every season separately, but it's just a box with all the separate seasons together, not even a conmemorative book with an episode guide, like the one from The OC, or extra discs with never-before-seen bonus features, so I think it should be cheaper than that. Gossip Girl deserved a better complete series release than this one. I would recommend you to buy the separate seasons and save a lot of money.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great story of two soldiers lives.  Amazing that the two could re connect and become friends.  Could not put this book down!  Unbeleivable!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|My friend said she loved this book, so against my better judgement, I bought it.  I used to read his stuff a lot, but hadn't picked up one of his books in a long time.  I enjoyed his earlier books very much, but got tired of reading too many words.  It seems to me he can be very long winded.  I couldn't finish the last King book I tried to read.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed 11/22/63.  I highly recommend it.
B00846F1YW|1.0|Game won't continue after second level without posting to Twitter/Facebook. And the authentication process for Facebook is broken, so really it's forcing you to spam via Twitter, which I'm not willing to do. Passing this sort of junk off as a free app of the day seems a little dishonest. Uninstalling, and won't touch anything from this company with a bargepole again.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Well done miniseries with a charming Emma.  I found this more detailed and entertaining than the book.  It gives more detail and emotion than the movie Emma with Gweneth Paltro. I like that movie, but this is deeper and i loved it!
B00AA2ONDI|3.0|This is a pretty good show for kids. It's a little old and dated now, but, it is tough to find movies that are suitable for children anymore.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This book progressed as if Grisham was thinking people would buy anything with my name on it.  I was completely left cold by it. Who really was the protagonist? I didn't care at all. Was the clever plotting and planning presented in an estimable, entertaining manner? No, it was laid out in a  formulaic sequence apologetically. And don't ask me to describe the abrupt, unsatisfactory ending. This will be my last purchase of a John Grisham book, which is a terrible shame because his early work contains some of my favorite thoughtful and thought-provoking work.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This is a really unique story. the only thing I didn't like was the kid. At first you're really impressed with him, but then he gets a little corny. Not enough to ruin the movie, just slightly annoying :)
B005VPRET4|5.0|Lego friends has made these products to appeal to girls and it has done it's job well. My daughter had fun assembling this cafe. It looks real nice. She comes up with vivid stories and plays it with often.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an awesome awesome story. It is a very unique concept, not your typical teenage romance novel. I was riveted the whole time. The downside is it gets a little repetative in the end...&#34;we get it ok! You really really love eachother&#34;. Still worth the read, but dissapointed it didn't stay amazing until the end
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Works well on my Kindle Hd 7.  Scans quickly and stays on watch 24x7.  I like avast and use it on my big computers too.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a good game to sit down and decompress for 20 minutes after work.<br />I enjoy the music and the soothing graphics.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|sometimes you get an app that is just for fun and works well this is one of them.  I enjoy no brainer games to fill in time when I have to wait, this is a great one for that. Items are very small hard to see.
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|I don't know how he keeps getting better and better, but \\"The Sirens\\" represents another giant step and a whole new peak for Chris Potter. I agree with the other reviewer who said that this album is on a par with \\"A Love Supreme\\"--the only difference being that I will probably listen to this one even more than to Coltrane's masterpiece. The key to its greatness may be the inspiration that Potter draws from the Odyssey, which brings a level of coherence and unity to this album that takes it beyond even his great Live at the Vanguard recordings. And his writing has reached a whole new level of lyricism and assurance that just blows me away. Chris Potter, arguably the greatest jazz musician of our times, has truly come into his own.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I likethis app.  It works amazingly well doing what I need it to do.  It is helpful for shopping.  One of the best simple apps I have gotten
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love Josh Groban's music and purchased this the day it came out...wonderful CD.  If you are a Josh Groban fan this CD is a must for you.<br /><br />b raliz
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Granddaughters like this app.  Keeps them busy for a while but seems not to have enough action for them. Its ok.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Even though I do not typically like si-fi or magical realism, I am hooked on Fringe.  The acting and the production is so good. The characters are written and portrayed well;  I am really worried about what is happening to Olivia and Peter. I must admit I do subscribe to some conspiracy theories, and I like political intrigue.  I am also a fan of medical detective and public health risks stories.  So on many levels I am a targeted audience for this series.  Every day my partner and I allow our selves one episode to check in on Olivia.  we dole out the series like an addictive drug.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I absolutely loved this. It drew me in from the first paragraph and I was in love with the characters at once. Anyone who has ever had Mommy issues will love this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|at the first major plot twist I laughed out loud and texted my wife from Thailand (as she had read it first and kept me in the dark). What a great plot device doing two narratives.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a good workout. I don't use it as a 30 day program, I just use it once or twice a week in my rotation because it mixes cardio and core.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I did use it as the 30 day program and by day 14 my knee hurt so badly that I could barely walk on it. I've never had any knee problems before. It got better when I stopped. Just be careful as it is a little intense for daily use.<br /><br />Day one was really hard but it was getting easier by the second week.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I loved Gone Girl but this novel didn't live up to my expectations. The ending was less a great surprise and more the last minute new fact we couldn't anticipate.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|i'm  a big fan of DC and love to coolet movies and superman is one of the best ones and waiting for the man of stell
B003V2HWP0|5.0|Super movie, excellent acting, beautiful costumes, scenery and location.  An unusual story line that I've not come across before.<br />You won't be disappointed.  I would buy this movie in BluRay if it ever comes out.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Page turner. Couldn't put it down though scared witless. Is was and always will be a classic. Must read if you're a Stephen King fan.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|It was a tad predictable and of course, we missed Matt Damon, but it was action-packed and certainly entertaining.  If you are fan of the other Bourne movies, you will probably be a little disappointed with this one, but you should still find it entertaining -- has a few twists and turns... enough to keep you interested.
0890090572|5.0|Got this for my mom, who is a huge Sherlock fan, for Christmas. She was delighted and really enjoyed this book.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, but these new superheroes flicks are all very &#34;dark&#34;.  If you are an action adventure fan than you will surely enjoy this movie.
B00821OX98|4.0|This show is entertaining and certainly appeals to the science geek in me, but the premise and even the characters are remarkably similar to some of the characters of the Walking Dead.  The aliens in the movie serve as interesting and formidable adversaries, and probably the most intriguing aspect of the show is the origin, motives, and technology of the aliens, but let's be honest.  It's a bit far fetched that the humans would be able to aptly defend themselves when you take into account the full breadth and magnitude of the alien firepower, but I'm nitpicking a little.<br /><br />Aside from logistics, the character development is appealing, though a bit cliche and predictable at times and rife with plenty of feel-good moments.  The characters are certainly not as edgy and conflicted as the Walking Dead characters who possess that intangible rawness that really pulls you into the Walking Dead story and ramps ups the tension.  Conversely, the Falling Skies characters are a little too surreal and optimistic given their precarious predicament and taking into consideration that they live the with the constant threat of being wiped out by an exceptionally armed alien army hanging over their heads.  Overall, I enjoy watching it as an Amazon Prime member, but I probably wouldn't pay to watch it.  I can't say the same about the Walking Dead.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|I'm glad I didn't rush to the theatre to see this.  Frankly, Sly is getting a little too old to be running around in these action hero parts.  He and Arnie should just enjoy retirement and leave the explosions to the younger crowd.  That said, it wasn't bad entertainment, but won't be winning any Oscars.  If you like Sly and you liked The Expendables, you will probably like this.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|This is not the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. They are a bit too stuck on themselves, too impressed with their own talents. It bespeaks arrogance rather than quality. The characters in the Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth have a sweetness that is complimented by intelligence. Even the bonus features betray that the actors are more impressed with themselves than they are interested in delivering a great performance. I fault the director to a degree. He shifts many lines that were meant for the young ladies' father in the story to Keira Knightly. She comes off as pompous rather than intelligent. A failing strung throughout the entire showing.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I missed this in the theatre so when I saw it on Amazon, I decided to order it.  It was okay.  Moderately amusing, but I could've skipped it.  Frankly, I don't think Matt McConaghy is that great of an actor, nor is Channing Tatum.  Watching them prance around in their skivvies was good fun, but that was about the only thing worth seeing this movie for.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Drawn in from the first and held firmly in the grip of the story throughout.  Twists, turns and possibilities abound here.  Do not start this if you have other things to be done in the near future.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This movie was ok.  The story was interesting and the action was good.<br />Worth watching if you have nothing else to do.
B000001EUL|5.0|Classic album. This is going on my heavy metal / hard rock play list on my mp3 player. A must have!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I love this show.  Great story and character development.<br />It only gets better the more you watch.<br />This season is very enjoyable.
B0013DDN5M|5.0|Classic album. This is going on my heavy metal / hard rock play list on my mp3 player. A must have!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|There is really no reason to watch this movie.<br />Seemed too long and just boring.<br />The story was decent, but really no reason to ever watch
B008MEM24S|5.0|Wheres My Perry is a fun game my grandchildren, ages 4-8, boys and girls,  love this game!<br />It is challenging and yet does not require a lot of adult help.
B00932A2MC|3.0|If you like the transformers movies you might like this.<br />The action is pretty nice, but the story is lame.<br />A plus is Brooklyn Decker.  Shes nice to look at for 2 hours.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|...that Hugh Laurie is an excellent Blues man? I sure didn't! I'm a life-long Blues aficionado; I love the entire genre from the earliest field-hollers to the latest practitioners of this High Art. A tip of the hat to Mr. Laurie for contributing to this wonderful musical form.  Sure don't hurt that Allan Toussaint, Dr. John, Tom Jones & other greats are involved...
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This movie came with more hype than it deserved.<br />If you have nothing else to do, watch this.<br />If you like cheesy horror/vampire movies you can watch this.<br />Just don't let other people see you watch this or recommend it.  They will think you have no taste in movies
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read way into the night because I couldn't put it down. The twist in the end really got me.
B002PNF8HK|1.0|I like horror movie and this sucked.<br />Bad story, bad acting, bad everything.<br />It was such a waste of time to watch.
B007IK44CK|2.0|the connection was inadequeate<br /><br />it went from HD to lower quality to enable viewing<br />but it kept stalling<br />so i quit watching :(
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This movie was interesting.  I would give it 3.5 stars.<br />Worth watching if you have time to kill.<br />Better than the Stalone Judge Dredd.
B004N6369Y|4.0|It's about a family tide, a strong bound between father and dauter, it's a greatebook that keeps  your attention on the story.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This movie is wroth watching.  Interesting story and great acting.<br />If you like baseball or Clint Eastwood you would enjoy this movie.<br />Plus you can't beat looking at Amy Adams for 2 hours!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My son loves this app. the graphics are alot better than on the original Temple run. I do not approve of my son playing violent games so this game is great.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Yes, its not as good as the book but movies seldom are, its nearly impossible to put everything from the book in a movie so get over yourself if that is your problem with this movie.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I thought it was the greatest thing ever<br /><br />The only thing I thought was odd was that the dogs were talking<br />The book is awesome
B0035JGYZS|5.0|Loved this movie and have watched it a few times. Acting is well done, especially compared to the original series, movies, etc
B004RKXN44|5.0|It is such a sweet loving book with bits of action and humor to keep you in the book. I loved it and this author you rock.
0316228532|1.0|Simply stated, this is the worst book I have ever read.  I did finish it, hoping in vain for redemption at the end.  Now if I could only erase the knowledge of the miserable characters from my mind.  I have not one good thing to say about the experience of reading A Casual Vacancy.  What would prompt a writer to fill so many pages with meaningless drivel about mentally ill people?
B00280LYHS|4.0|I felt like went pretty slow. It was a great book though. Though, it didn,t have a shocking ending. WORD
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you were hooked from the first season, this one will keep you well engaged and desperate for Season 3!  Keep Calm and Carry On :-)
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is so fun and if your bored it's super fun. This game is also similar to diner dash and since it has flown its almost is diner dash.
B0031RSA24|5.0|It can be a bit treaky because the author likes to go into detail about each of his points. But it is realy realy good.
B008US4PBY|1.0|They didn't work. Tech support will only tell you to ship it back if you have a problem because they legitimately have no engineers to solve the problem on hand. Their online help section is pathetically simple and does not offer any solutions to a majority of complications on the device. It isn't user friendly (I did understand how to manage the device however) and you're basically on your own if you run into a problem.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Just what I needed.  I was having trouble downloading pictures onto my iPad so this just what needed.  Thank you.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie was a great movie. It had me laughing the entire time. I am going out right now to buy it for my home.
B0071MV540|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to those who like action and comedy at the same time.  Very entertaining family movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It helps you make sense of it all! Very inspiring! Well written. There is alot more to the world than the experts admit!
B008EQIEWS|4.0|Good action movie.  Made me remember what i learned in high school about the gods and goddesses.  Highly recommend this movie for those looking for action.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|Totally inaccurate with myths and fairy tales the likes of which would increase or dependence on foreign oil and flush our economy down the toilet. If you buy into this hype the terrorists win
B0098VYCCE|4.0|It's not a bad movie, considering that Kristen Stewart is in it and made a personal fool of herself by getting involved with the director.  It is action filled and very suspenseful. I recommend this movie.
B007SGM084|3.0|I was totally disappointed, and lost a lot of interest in books due to unnecessary repition. I definitely will check out material prior to purchase next time from this author.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I loved the comedic touch and the serious tone of the movie.  It's a good family movie and highly recommended.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci's usual &#34;edge of seat&#34; writing is very entertaining. Thanks again for the good work. His books are always &#34;top notch&#34;
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|I love this movie and have since it first came out.  It is an old favorite and I was so happy to see this as an option on amazon.  It was a lovely walk through memories, and a good watch.  I laughed even more than I did 15 years ago.  Being a bit more grown up only made it funnier.  If you've not seen it, you should check it out!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's ability to spin a story, and keep you totally interested,  is outstanding. My problem with his work is, he doesn't come out with new material fast enough!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|some of the same base as the story out of Austria a couple of years ago -- but this heartbreaking story was excellently written -- couldn't put it down.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|If you have a teenage son, this story will keep you guessing, even after you have turned the last page. Great story and writing style.  One of the best books I have read in a long time.
B0012NO4WO|4.0|Finally had to go out and just rent this from a Blockbusters, because somehow between my mac, my girlfriend's PC, and every major browser on each of these (and the Amazon Windows app, which was crap) we still couldn't get it to work in anything above completely pixelated, blocky crap quality. Now we're on a 30mbps pipe, and Netflix has always worked fine on both our computers, in high quality without any glitches. So it was a wasted $4, and I'm just surprised Amazon's product failed so comprehensively.<br /><br />Oh the movie? It's a fun flick. Not much depth but an enjoyable ride. Definitely feels 80s -- but that's part of the fun. Switch off your inner critic and your 80s hairstyle detector, and you'll enjoy it.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|the back ground was often too dark to view the film properly, i have a hd tv and pumped up the brightness.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's Angry Birds!  What's not to like.  The parrot is is a joy.  The monkeys--so much more--fun that the stupid pigs swear at the birds and taunt them, then get knocked head over tails!  I love it.
B008476HBM|5.0|This was my second reading of the book and just like some  new dish  I find something new to like each time. I love this story!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have only read a couple of Spark's books because I feel like they can be too predictable. This book however had a different change of pace. Katie coming from a not so perfect background and an abusive marriage put a twist on the Nicholas Spark's cookie cutter book. I found it very interesting to look through the abusive husband's eyes and see how he thinks and acts and to read about Katie's point of view on the run and starting over. It definitely made me cheer Katie on for having the courage to get out although the suspense that her husband would always be looking for her kept me turning the page. Also, Alex's character is very sweet and heartwarming how he too has struggles of his own yet with Katie (quiet and skittish she may be) he is able to get her to open up and trust again.<br /><br />This book I would say is 4 stars as in parts it was predictable. It was well written and the characters and background was very believable. Would recommend to family and friends.
0440237688|5.0|I first read this book 5 years ago and I just finished it again. It was as good now as it was then. Lois Lowry is a perfect example of a compelling and proficient YA author.<br /><br />The story is about 20 years old and still one of the best YA dystopia's out there. I haven't seen a young adult or children's dystopia that has met or surpassed The Giver in both quality of writing or as an interesting, appealing and thought-provoking storyline.<br /><br />I suspect the ambiguous ending might have been a bit of dissatisfaction for some people but it never was for me. I was fine with the ending, yet, I was very pleased to learn there were sequels to this book! Quartet actually! I have yet to read the last book in the quartet (Son) but I highly recommend the second and third books 'Gathering Blue' and 'Messenger.' They are also very well done! A must read!
B004D23BRU|2.0|I watched this with my 8 1/2 year old daughter because she did not know the full story of Peter and the Wolf.  I MISTAKENLY decided to share this version with her!!!! It is very artistic although somewhat disturbing for a young child.  No dialogue at all.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie was off the hook!!! I definitely recommend it to all, Seth did a great job with this flick! It's a must watch
B002361MLA|5.0|Wonderfully inspiring!  Wish I had read this years ago!  If you need to slow down and remember what's important, this is perfect for you!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book grabs your attention and holds it.  Once you start reading it it is hard to put down.  I would recommend reading this book.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|If you really want a multi-dimensional study on the interplay between addiction and someone bestowed with the public trust, watch Narc, with Ray Liotta and Jason Patric.  It is altogether a better film than this.
B00821OX98|3.0|If you're looking to kill time and have already watched Downton Abby, 24, Sherlock, and other good shows on here then you can give this a try. I am halfway through the 1st season and I'm not that impressed but it has kept my interest. The main character has a smirk on his face for the WHOLE movie! It took me a long time to get over that. Having him smile when there's a sad moment, or if he was getting into a heated argument. Graphics are sub-par.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I had heard a lot of great thins about this movie and when we needed<br />movies for our bus trip I decided to purchase it.  I thouroughly enjoyed it.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like that it's easy to use. Very professional. Easy to make notes and memos. Very easy for people to use and work with.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The animation was pretty good. The game has beautiful scenery. The story was also really good. I also enjoyed the extra content at the end of the game.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Great movie with great special effects. I liked the beginning that had Captain America small it seem like it was all true.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|This book was amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves unconventional books. I would read this book more than once it was so great.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I've heard many good things about this show.  Now, I've had a chance to watch it for myself.  It focuses on the strange and unexplained events that take place in the world.<br /><br />Great show.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|If only there could be individuals like this in real life.  What a tender, loving story, and Part 2 just carried their love story forward.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|I like Jack to get it on as soon as possible....the long preamble to get to what it is that he has to do slowed me down a bit. I also had Tom Crusie in the back of my mind and could not block out his image. Personally I dont have a problem with Tom Cruise as an actor, my problem was with the casting of him in the role of Jack Reacher. I will not go and see the movie...It would have been better to cast a complete unknown actor than one of the more known 'die-hard' characters.
B00846REIS|5.0|What can I say about this book.....just loved it!!!  Feelings that I never knew I felt were awakened.  I will definitely read it over and over again.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|He spent too much time inside a car going back and forth. the only real bit of fun was at the end of the book and even that did not impress me. the fact that the police lady was killed in the story was also a bit of a let down for me. I would have liked him to have at least, got to Virgina, even though Susan is no longer there....but then I guess it leaves the plot open for a new book.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Thought it was a great & true story.  Well casted & played.  Helen Hunt looks great, bold move playing the scenes as she did but made the movie more authentic.  Glad I purchased & watched it.
0393345084|5.0|The name of the book is \\"End This Depression Now!\\" and the author is Paul Krugman. I  recommend this book very strongly. Krugman has the solutions that will work to restore good jobs in this country. As he points out, the Great Depression did not really end until massive federal funds were spent  to prepare us for the second world war. Clearly we do not want to spend more money on military hardware than we are already doing. It is not what the money is spent on that is important, the benefit comes from  more money being in circulation. In our times, we have a very serious infrastructure problem where roads and bridges have deteriorated to where they are dangerous. At the same time, we have huge numbers of construction workers sitting idle. Moreover, the cost of borrowing money is at an all-time low. Obviously repairing our infrastructure is one important area to apply stimulus spending.<br /><br />If the answer is so obvious then why are we not doing it? Krugman points out that President Obama's stimulus bill was successful, but it was too small for the task. There was opposition to it from the Republicans and perhaps a larger bill could never have  passed. Thus, the spending did not reduce unemployment to the levels forecast by the administration. However it did change the situation to where  750,000 jobs lost per month ended and employment grew again. Yet the Bill's failure to reduce unemployment to as low as promised, made Congress unwilling to approve any new stimulus bills.<br /><br />Krugman points out that there are two schools of thought about Keynesian economics in our country today. Keynesian economics advocates increased federal spending to revive a sluggish economy and reduced spending in a hot economy. Despite the lessons of history, especially during the Great Depression, there is a anti-Keynesian  group today which advocates cutting spending in hard times. Krugman believes this latter approach is disastrous. He points out that Great Britain is a modern example of austerity making the recession considerably worse. Great Britain is experiencing a triple dip recession as a result of their austerity programs.<br /><br />Krugman is an economist and this book is about economic theory, which means that it cannot read like a thriller. That said, I would give him high marks trying to present the material of the book in a down to earth, elementary manner. The more that you follow current events, the easier this book will be to read. Personally, I have spent considerable time over the years trying to stay informed and still encountered a few areas in the book where the concepts were not easy to grasp. Yet, most of the book was easy. Before I opened the book, I was ready convinced that more stimulus spending is necessary. So reading this book reinforced my existing opinion. Despite my bias, I didn't understand the principles like Krugman does, and so I did learn a lot from his arguments. Events,  which seem to be isolated from one another in my mind, merged together as Krugman explained these events as part of his economic overview.<br /><br />Finally, I especially hope those of you still believing in austerity as a solution to our current economic problems read this book. What Paul Krugman wants to do may seem irrational to you. An individual needs to cut his spending when he is too much in debt. You want to generalize this individual's solution to the national problem. By reading this book, you will understand why that is wrong and, in fact, is the exact opposite of what we really need to do.<br /><br />Ralph D.

B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Good plot lines, moves along well, glad it ended as it did - DW's character was beginning to irritate me.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Everytime I would earn coins and gems at a certain amount it would take them all away, so I would start over and it would do the same thing. Also it would start the game over, but leaving me at the same level. This happened 4 times. Real sucky game
B007EECSFA|5.0|Secret kept nearly to the end of the story. Great twist of events.  Not predictable. Enjoyable  read.<br />Am definitely going to read more of Kate Morton.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love having this app available for use on my Kindle fire.  User friendly and easy to read and it's free!
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Very addictive book! Couldn't stop reading for quite a while and finished it very fast. Author has unique style of putting events in parallel and keeping up the action going (lots of action).
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Love having this app available for use on my Kindle fire.  User friendly and easy to read and it's free!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|5stars all the way!!! This is the best series I've seen in years....I highly recommend it. You can watch the first two seasons via Amazon Prime for free. Wish the 3rd season was free too...but we'll worth the $1.99 fee per episode!
0812415027|5.0|I read this book many years ago and picked it up once again to enjoy once again a life of a young man becoming a vet and what he encounters and experiences. That is not only with domesticated and farm animals but with the people who care for them. Some stories are sad like the old man who had to have his dog put down. All in all, a wonderful story.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|great  item was as expected.  it was a gift and he loved it.  will order others with confidence.  Thanks again.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Is that the new &#34;I couldn't put it down?&#34; A great read from beginning to end. Makes food - and not just the people who prepare it - sexy and fun. If you've seen Bourdain on TV before, then you can hear his voice jumping off at you from the page. Totally recommend it.
B0086900TI|5.0|I really think this was body's best performance -- even better than his Oscar winning role in the pianist...<br />solid supporting cast, too..
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Unless you're ok with spontaneous bursts of laughter on public transportation or in random Starbuckses (Starbi?). A hysterical read. Moran has sharp insight into modern feminism. She converted me!
B00AN0KGWE|1.0|The description  says it is and even though I thought it was strange that it was included with my Prime membership, especially since I had to PAY a bunch for the first season, I &#34; bought&#34; it. Disappointment for me!<br />All this is is Special Features of Season2, misleading description notwithstanding .
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Let's just say there's nothing negative I can say about this app. It's the best one I've found and I highly recommend it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I just loved this book. The whole story flowed with such incite into the characters motivations which was just enough, not over done, to make the story pleasurable and not an analysis on relationships. Pleasurable, intriguing, witty, fun and terribly romantic.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent writing keeps you guessing as you never know whats going to happen at the Downton. If you like historical series this is the show for you.
0765325950|5.0|Nice way to tie it all up. I love the fact that they were not reluctant to put some of the major characters, not only into dire straits, but also eliminating some in heroic fashion. Great finish, perfect amount of answers with some lingering questions to allow you to draw your own conclusion.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yes...#2 just as good as #1.  Now ready for  #3!  Very much recommend as an excellent read to all who have read #1.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Having seen the movie; after reading the book, I felt as though I was right where the action was, with a front row seat.  The events that led up to the missing Harriet and the details behind every family member, made the book much more intense then the movie.  I like the out lined details of each and every person involved in telling the story.  Even though the names of the towns<br />were foreign to me, it felt as though I was seeing a place as a visitor.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|After watching the previews, I had to read this book! It was excellent. The story line speaks to you. Read it if you have  the chance
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I received this in the mail yesterday afternoon. While I was separating the legs of the tripod so it could stand, it completely fell apart. Don't buy this product.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|After releasing two albums in 2009, their self-titled album and For The Lions, Hatebreed is back with their sixth studio album The Divinity of Purpose. From start to finish Divinity is heavy, it's in your face, and it's just a joy to listen to. If you've ever heard a Hatebreed album in the past then you can expect to hear more of the same on Divinity. However, you do see the band dip their toes in a few new elements which was nice.<br /><br />For example track six, \\"Indivisible\\", has a some nice skate-punk riffs thrown in the mix (think Pennywise). Then track eleven, \\"Boundless (Time To Murder It)\\", is home to some of the first breakdowns we've heard from Hatebreed. I might be mistaken, but this is the first instance where I've heard breakdowns like this on a Hatebreed album. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. Either way, both of these things flow smoothly with the rest of the album and don't come off as forced.<br /><br />What I enjoyed more than these technical advances, however, was Jamey Jasta's vocal experimentation. On track seven, \\"Dead Man Breathing\\", Jasta's delivery on certain parts of the chorus is very reminiscent of Wayne Static's work with Static-X. Certain areas of track eight, the title-track, sound like they were influenced by Milo Aukerman of Descendents. And the chorus on track nine, \\"Nothing Scars Me\\", sounds very similar to Robb Flynn's vocal work for Machine Head.<br /><br />Lyrically Divinity is your average Hatebreed. There's a lot of self-empowerment. A lot of standing up for what you think is right. Being an individual, standing out from the crowd, etc. The beautiful thing about it is that no one can do this like Hatebreed. Even though they've been basically making the same music for over 15 years, it still sounds good. Why fix what isn't broken, right?<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Honor Never Dies\\" \\"Before The Fight Ends You\\" & \\"Boundless (Time To Murder It)\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 9/10 - The Divinity of Purpose is short and sweet. Clocking at around 38 minutes it isn't overdone and it stays true to what fans love from Hatebreed. The Divinity of Purpose definitely isn't an album for everyone, I doubt your Grandma will like it, but any fan of Hatebreed is sure to enjoy this.
B003P2WJ6S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! The history behind the woman behind the HeLa cells is so interesting and a story that should be told to everyone. Its well written and even with how much scientific detail it is very easy to follow. Highly recommended!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Super Fringe: The Complete First Season In the series premiere, FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham (ANNA TORV) investigates a fatal international flight, recruiting Dr. Walter Bishop (JOHN NOBLE) and his son (JOSHUA JACKSON) to help.
B0090P0O70|5.0|Wonderful.  Really makes you think about the consequences of your actions.  Much better than the movies.  I couldn't put it down
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I found the game to be a lot of fun at the beginning with the story being introduced, but it soon became a grind. The minigames for leveling up got quickly repetitive and annoying. I hope more variety will be implemented soon. It's fun to watch your little town grow, but purchasing more land and removing obstructions like boulders will swiftly empty your bank. It's just so expensive. For example, I was given a quest to remove six removable items from the field. Only two small objects were to be found, costing 500 gold each, which was totally fine, but every other object cost either 4000, 8000, or 16000. I still have yet to gain enough money to remove enough objects to clear the quest. Aside from these gripes, the game will last you a while and you will enjoy it.
B0059IVV9M|5.0|With each release, Beirut consistently amazes me and makes me an even greater fan than I was previously.  This is an absolutely wonderful album.  Very intense emotion and feeling in each piece.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Very cool movie with amazing special effects. It's definately worth a watch if you're into chick flicks. Great Valentines Day gift! There are a few curve balls in this one that shouldn't be missed if you're into the series.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|After reading 19minutes I couldn't wait to read more from Jodi pickling.  This book was neither great or disappointing it was just plain predictable from cover to cover. It got me through a l.power outage after a heavy New England snow storm that was for me the best part about it unfortunately
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This album has grown on me a lot after listening to it several times.  Lost love, regret, youth. One thing that really makes this album stand out from the typical pop music of today is that the lyrics have complexity to them.  It isn't 6 lines and a repeated chorus.<br /><br />Raised to a 5.  This album has really grown on me and is one of my favorites now.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Karl Urban is awesome.  This movie is action packed and love the new cool new movie scenes at the end.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Very addicting. Well written. Great characters. Funny. Show builds from pilot episode, I recommend watching it from first episode of first season and in order for maximum enjoyment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished this book and it is now one of my favorites.  Right from the first page, it captures your attention and you don't want to put it down.  This is my first time reading a book by Colleen Hoover and I immediately ordered \\"Slammed\\" so I can start that one next.  Wonderful writing, wonderful story, it keeps you on your toes the entire time wanting to find out what is happening next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is really fun, it its a great time passer. Fun waiting room game. The horses are really pretty. The games and cleaning, don't know about the racing yet.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great way to waste time. Use when waiting for kids to get out of practice. Hope it continues this way if not I will change my review
B004GFN11A|5.0|Works great on my phone. I can access my blog anytime to see the stats, make changes or write a blog post on the go.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Game is fun, but can't figure out how to update the game without buying the newer version, every other app store, googleplay and itunes gives free updates, and it does it automatically. I didn't think amazon was so behind the times.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|4.5 stars!!<br /><br />I simply LOVED this book. There are no words. Seriously. Read it for yourself to find out what happens. No spoilers here. ;)<br />Highly recommended! Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00656C6KK|5.0|My wife and I have listened to Doris Day for years.  My wife chose as her ringtone &#34;Que Sera', Sera'&#34;.  The tribute to her son was quite touching.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|The formula doesn't work any more. &#34;11/22/83&#34; starts out with an idea that could really work well, but King's return to the formula that must equate to money in his pocket, is disappointing for the reader.  Reiteration gets old fast, and violence against children is a weak crutch in anyone's writing quiver. Long ago, King proved that he is capable of incredible writing, why not do so. I think he would be well served if he edited out gratuitous gore - shock value is over rated - and reiteration of anything - put the pen down, come back with a new thought.  I quit reading when King got to killing the mother and kids for the umpteenth time - come on Stephen - write a masterpiece for us!
B00999DFP0|5.0|Love that i have all of bbt in one place, the show wasnt on Netflicks! Now we watch the show every night. Whats great is that these shows can be watched over and over! and all the dvds were good, no problems!
B00701L5XS|4.0|This is one of the best sources for knot tying that I have found, but there are no directions provided on the tightening sequence which is crucial on getting it right.  Maybe just adding arrows to indicate which limbs to pull first would be enough.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Wow wow wow WOW!!! If your never read Terri Goodkind  sword of truth series your missing a great  written books. Not only have I read the series once but TWICE!! If a movie was made I'd be watching it
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved it and I will reread it. Very informative as well as kind of comforting. I have told many people about it, and they all read it.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Production, directing, acting--all of it. I adore Denzell, (who doesn't) and EVERY ONE does a beautiful job with the script.. The script is VERY realistic/true to life. I was a drug and alcohol counselor for many years and am involved in my own recovery for thirty plus years now. This story was told well and with enough tact to involve any audience. Thanks for the message of recovery.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Loved watching Season 2.  I didn't watch the series as it was being aired on network television.  I started with Season 1 on Netflix and could not wait to watch Season 2.  I am very happy that I am now caught up and can watch Season 3 as the new episodes come out.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A classic book that every girl should read as they grow up. I down loaded this for free and re-read it and I am very glad I did because it was just as moving the second time around.
030758836X|5.0|i loved this book. it keeps you guessing, to say the least, up til the last word. a fascinating character study, and a study of a marriage, popular culture, and pop crime knowledge. so well worth reading. highly recommended. would love to read the sequel.....doubt there will be one, but it would be very interesting to say the least.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it its really fun and stuff yo!!!!!! .-. but its harder than the first by far. but yeah once again its really fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. It is written so well. Suzanne Collins really makes you sit on the edge of your seat. She came up with an amazing plot and designed everything so perfectly. I love the whole love story thing between Peeta and Katniss but it's driving me crazy because I want her to fall for Gale. I wish that Peeta would understand and not be angry with her. This is the second time I've read this book and I promise you I wasn't disappointed. I'm reading the trilogy over again and can't wait to start Mockingjay!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this game makes it so i can hang out with them all the time, i really enjoy this game
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's an easy enough game to play, and can be relaxing, but the &#34;hints&#34; is a problem. I have now used them twice unintentionally and have no idea what this is going to cost. I read other reviews that give negative feedback about the $$$, but I can't find any info that gives me answers to this. So if anyone reading this can let me know what the cost for using the hints is, I'd really appreciate it!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I played this game a while ago on my computer but had forgotten about it.  Then I got a phone that would play games and went looking for stuff and found this again.  I got this thinking there would be better stuff out there.  But after looking through many, many game apps, I realize that this is one of the best out there.  Although its nothing more than a variation of tower defense...the concept and gameplay are very catchy.  And for some reason, it is very addicting.<br /><br />This is one of the those games that I don't mind paying a dollar or two to get because I get alot of entertainment out of it.
B009K86D86|5.0|A must watch! Reveals where our food really comes from... And what we are really putting in our bodies! Take the time to research the information, and this movie will change the way you and your family eat!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|For some reason when I go see a new Tom Cruise movie I expect it to be a dud. I have no idea why I expect failure, and I was very wrong on my assumptions. This movie was shockingly humorous and consistently funny with a lot of witty sarcasm. Plus there was enough action to go around as well. I loved it. Can't wait to watch it again.
B00846F1YW|1.0|I didn't even make it to level 13. It crashed on level 1 several times. I couldn't even play.  Too bad. I liked Mysteryville.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is by far the most effective alarm clock I've ever had. It got me up when I wanted to be and kept me from pressing the snooze button 10 times before I got up. I should warn anyone who is going to buy this though. Don't leave the volume level on 100% unless you can do math through extremely loud music or it's a quiet song that needs to be that loud to wake you up.
B005LAII80|5.0|I didn't think much of this movie when I hear it announced.  I thought just another remake but I think they did this one justice.  If you buy this be sure to get the 3D version if your TV supports it because the 3D effect is really quite impressive.  It was the buzz here on Amazon that got me excited and eventually made me buy this one.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The early life of Pi starts slow but when his family move by boat to a new country with some of there zoo animals it changes. It becomes a spine chilling heart gripping emotional ride for this Indian boy of many faiths.Thrown into a life boat with animal companions he fights the elements and nature with grit and faith to survive.There is  a great twist at the end.
B009MO5G90|4.0|These resident evil movies are my guilty pleasure.  It was great seeing the characters from the previous movies and games come together for this film.  I wish I could say the movie was awesome and that I talk about it all the time but I can't.  To be honest the movie is kind of forgetable.  Pretty good 3D though.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Loved the book. Now I am a big fan of Scott Jurek!<br /><br />I'm a runner myself (some times also a ultra runner) and this book made me to re-think my eating and running.
B004I9CXHW|1.0|Tried it with:<br /><br />a) old iPod Nano with 30 pin connector<br />b) new iPad with lightning connector<br />c) my new Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 2)<br /><br />Did not work with any of them. With Apple devices it said \\"device not recognized\\". With the Android phone it said that there is no music on the device.<br /><br />Of note, the new iPad with lightning connector works using stock 30 pin cable in the car when combined with Apple's 30 pin to Lightning adapter.<br /><br />I have not tried this cable with a simple USB drive, but this was not my intent, I was hoping to use it with my Android phone, as such for me it is a fail.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I spend a lot of my free time playing this game. It's simple, but it can be a challenge. I don't like that you have to pay for certain packs but they give you enough free ones that you won't complain unless if you pay this game religiously. It's a really great game for casual gamers.

B00846F1YW|1.0|Wth is up with forcing me to post to my Facebook or Twitter feeds? What if I don't have an account?! Yeah, yeah the fact that I do doesn't count. I don't want to play a game that forces itself upon my friends. Even though it was free, I'm still deleting it.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I enjoyed season 1 of Fringe for a number of reasons:  The individual episodes were separately interesting, as well as providing rapidly accumulating clues to the meta-narrative.  The main characters, especially Anna Torv's Olivia Dunham and John Noble's Walter Bishop, were quirky and engaging.  Overall, I was very satisfied with season 1, and look forward to starting season 2 very soon..
B0083Z614S|5.0|It has been many years since I have read this book. I enjoyed every page as if it were the first time. This should be a required read for all children!

0446554995|5.0|I tore through this book in 4 days! I started it late one night and before I knew it I had read 100 pages. Preston & Child draw you in immediately and don't let you go until the very end. Although this was the end of the \\"Helen\\" series, I still have questions about what could happen in the future stories about the wonderful FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast. Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the separate storylines in this book centered on Constance Greene and Corrie Swanson. Cold Vengeance (the last Pendergast book)really left Corrie hanging and Constance was still an enigma. I would love to meet Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child to shakes their hands and thank them for creating such a complex character such as Pendergast, who entertains and surprises me so much that I want to reread all of his books to see what I might have missed. Now if I could only figure out what actor would do the part justice....
B004OC07F8|5.0|Very well thought out business book. Creates a simple theory to evaluate business opportunities. Really good read for business students and professionals.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|I chose this book because I love mysteries set in bleak, isolated places, so a tale of grisly murder set in the cold, rainy, rocky Scottish Isles promised a ticket to my literary happy place. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Atmosphere and authenticity are key words for this book. I almost felt the dampness on my skin and the heavy mud caking on my feet reading trudging around the plot of this book. The characters refer to each other by their Gaelic names---I felt like I was given a tour of Scottish culture and history. And I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />I was also very happy to find out that this is part of a series (one of several award winning detective series by this writer) and am looking forward to reading the next two installments.<br /><br />Characters. Always important, maybe the most important of all. May delivers here as well. The characters were as colorful as the landscape was bleak. I was committed to seeing them through and cared about what happened.<br /><br />Plotwise, it is what I believe people call a police procedural as I understand the term and it was very effective in this regard. The book was a solid 5 stars for me until the end when there was a reveal that related back to events from many years before which I found to be not credible. I hate spoilers so that is all that I will say and leave it to others to either agree or disagree.<br /><br />I enjoyed it enough to purchase a return trip to Scotland to see what happens in the next installment.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Much more entertaining show than the subject matter might suggest. Not groundbreaking, but this show is still worth a watch.

1442419814|4.0|Tally has always known how life works.  You start out Little.  You become an Ugly.  When you turn 16, you undergo an operation that turns you into a Pretty.  After that, life is good.  Tally can't wait to be Pretty.<br /><br />But Tally's new friend, Shay, has other ideas.  Before her operation, Shay runs away to the Smoke: a rebel group of those who refuse to undergo the operation.<br /><br />Threatened by the Smoke, those in charge of Tally's world-a select few called Specials-offer her an impossible choice: follow the cryptic directions Shay left to the Smoke and turn the rebels over to the Specials, or never be Pretty.  Hoping to save Shay, Tally sets out to locate the Smoke.  What she finds there forces her to re-learn everything she knew and launches her on an epic fight against the institutionalized conformity that has overtaken her world.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Here we have an alcoholic pilot who manages to land a plane that has malfunctioned.<br />He gets busted being loaded on the job and has to deal with the fallout.<br />Sounds pretty basic and it is.<br />What saves the film is excellent acting, direction and score.<br />Otherwise it's incredibly unrealistic in just about every way.<br />That's ok though, it was still a fun movie that was above average.<br />Recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw this book had made it to a movie - thought it was worth reading. Story kept moving at a great pace holding my interest throughout.
B006RZZ7HS|4.0|I chose four stars because I just watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, and since this is an old 80s flick, it has outdated special effects and goofy costumes. In other words, because of the type of movie this is supposed to be, it suffers from age and I cannot give it 5 stars. However, don't get me wrong, this is a very enjoyable movie if you are into sci-fi. Yes, this is the original before the movie Tron:Legacy. Despite what I said about the special effects, it actually holds up fairly well, but the costumes on the other hand are quite goofy and, having seen Tron: Legacy, I can definitely say that we've come a long way since this film.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges does a great job as the character Flynn and the story is interesting. If you're like me and saw Tron : Legacy first and are curious about how Tron got its start, (and are willing to forgive it's goofy costumes, etc.) I definitely say watch this movie at least once to see how it all began. Regardless, the movie is a classic sci-fi film and I think is worth a watch.
B000I9UA8U|5.0|There is a plot here with watching. A group of men who come to learn more about each other and themselves. Battered egos that need lifting. This movie depicts men with a unique solution to a problem. Recommended for family watching.Probably appropriate for any child over about 9 or so. Some will be bored by it. If they are, then let them go play video games and watch it yourself.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing Paul McCartney performing it on a PBS Special.  I had never imagined him as a crooner but this CD shows him at his crooner best!  If you want some easy listening that will have you singing along, this could be the Paul McCartney for you.
B002RMVAZ8|4.0|I liked it but Romeo and Juliet was better.  I would recommend it for most intellectuals and Shakespeare fans.  It might be hard to follow for the younger crowd.  Had trouble with buffering because of low provider signal so missed out on potential picture quality.
B00006JIA4|5.0|What can you say other than this collection is all that I hoped for and more!!  I am happy to finally have this collection.
B00340LM8C|5.0|It was in good picture quality and in good taste.  It was chosen because most movies in this time frame has no surprises to be distasteful for all age groups.  I would recommend it for all ages<br />  Hollywood needs more like this one giving good suspense without overdone action to be most realistic as related to.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Make sure you understand this CD is just HIGHLITES of the movie muscial: it is not the full sound track.<br /><br />It is just as fantastic as the movie version.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Not one of his best works. Reads ok just not to exciting slow moving storyline. Still one of my favorite authors
B002R5LKOQ|2.0|I don't like any Kevin Costner film I've ever seen. I'm lucky I did not have to pay to see it.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great sci- fi soap opera! Good cast and an engaging continuing plot of outlaws versus authority. Only drawback is that it only ran for one season. The DVD features 3 episodes that never aired. It would be great if Amazon Prime could post them for fans. Hint hint.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I chose this rating because I could not put the book down. There were so many twists in the book, and it kept me reading for hours.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Its a good movie to watch nothing new for a story line. The movie does have couple of funny parts.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I chose this rating because I thought it was an average book. I didn't have to continue reading it for hours, I was able to put the book down whenever I felt like it.
0425263916|5.0|It's great when a sequel starts right where the last book left off - once again the read becomes glued to your hands and bang goes any spare hours you had.<br /><br />Couple Gideon and Eva still have issues, although they are determined to make their life together a success. The best thing about them is they know they have to compromise with the help of others if they are going to continue to be together. Slowly Eva works through her problems but Gideon, on the other hand, is still very quiet about his past. The story line is deeper than in the first book, with more jealousy, obsessions, insecurities, high rolling emotions and a valuable lesson in trust. A more in-depth look at Gideon's family is given to the reader, leading to more details on the male protagonist.<br /><br />The naughty scenes are typical Day style: seriously raunchy and well written. It's really is endearing to read about a couple who have so much passion for each other and, even if he says he is not, Gideon is really a romantic at heart. The book's one downfall: we have to wait till May to find out if it really will be the happy ending we're all hoping for!<br /><br />Review by Stacey Vincent on behalf of BestChickLit.com
B0083GR6Y6|5.0|I enjoyed the movie but had a problem the last 30 minutes with it.  It kept going off and having to reload.  I have a new router so I think the problem was on the Amazon end.

B008NMT684|5.0|My 3-1/2yo was able to quickly complete all the puzzles, so I thought he would grow tired of the game quickly.  He did not! He loves it and asks to play it over and over.  He wants the volume turned up so he can hear the clapping and cheering. He pops all the balloons and thinks it's hysterical.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|While I completely enjoy all Grisham books, even if they are a tad formulaic, I wasn't so sure about this one.  The plot line left me wondering if, somehow, I'd missed reading whole sections of the book.  In the end, though, that was the intention of the author, and the ending made everything clear.  This is a departure from Grisham's usual style, but a fine read nonetheless.
B003ZJ70W4|4.0|It is always great to visit the SITC ladies, but the first one is still the better movie of the two.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|I loved the movie and I loved the book but the only plot they share is a C.I.A. assassin who has lost his memory.  VERY  complex plot.  Ludlow is a genius.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|it is grate. this is the fun game.this is the fun game. I am telling you. I am telling you. I am.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this series, it is very hard to stop watching after every episode. The actors and the story are very well done.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This is just stuck in Fantasy, but it should actually be categorized as Young Adult. It's perfectly fine if what you want to read is a book for teens or younger, but not if you want a mature novel with some complexity. Did someone seriously compare this writer to George R. R. Martin? Come on now.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Fun, great to pass time away but can also be addictive. Wish the game was totally free. You get to a certain level and your opted to pay for next level. But all in all its a great game.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I am impressed with the ability for the show to evolve.  It has changed, but is still good for 42 minutes of entertainment
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Everything you would expect from Tina Fey. A whole lot of funny, and a good bit of serious. Definitely had me laughing out loud more than once.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|This is a great duo that is going to be huge one day soon!  All of the songs are catchy and get stuck in my head. There is not a single song on this album that I do not love.  The first time I listened to it, I was like what the heck?  Now I am disappointed by how tame and normal other groups sound, they are truly unique and I can't wait to hear more from them in the future.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Advertisement promised acting, what we received was an abundance of bad and misplaced profanity.  How was this portrayal considered his finest role?  I do not recommend this movie.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|this was your typical Nicholas Sparks novel.  It is being made inot a movie and I think it will be interesting how it will be shown on the big screen
B003YUBXUE|5.0|Awesome! I loved it! It was full of action and thrilling! Kept me on the edge of my seat. Can't wait to read the next one, and the next, and the next! It's addictive! Brilliant!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I simply loved this story.  Victoria had such courage she made me ashamed to be so scared all the time. Even when she hurt people it was usually because she thought she was protecting them from her. I was so sad though out the book. but could not put the book down.  All the characters were special. especially Elizabeth and Grant.  Victoria was so human, flaws and strengths, I would have liked to meet her.
B00821OX98|5.0|At first I thought wow another Alien kind of thing, but to my surprise it was totattly different from what I thought.<br />I could not wait to see what happened next to everyone.
1592407889|3.0|This book was a relatively easy read. At approxiamtely 340 pages, I finished the book in half a day. This is not Mommy Dearest, although some less than admirable traits of Sachi's parents are disclosed. This is more the product of a woman trying to reconcile herself to her intimate relationships than a scathing tell all. It is an enjoyable book. However, while reading, I found Frederick Stroppel most inadequate in style and research and unworthy of being published as a writer. Standards in print these days though are horrendously low and he is not the worst I have run across. I blame this on the publishing world as a whole and I do not blame the authors only. It seems editors are more marketing cheerleaders than actual editors in todays corporate bottom line publishing world. Sachi tells her life story well enough. However, I feel she could use a therapist better equipped with tools of modern psychology. This tome was more like a bad execution of cognitive therapy than a memoir. I did find her life interesting and that of those around her. My deepest connection with Sachi is with her inadequacies and how she still, even past age 50, has never had anyone...Parents, Therapist, Husband, Boyfriends, Friends, Classmates etc....Grab her, look her in the face and say  \\"Sachi, you have no idea what love is do you?\\" Until she embraces this ignorance, she will continue being unfulfilled.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book caught me up in the storyline almost immediately. I stayed up way too late because I  couldn't' t wait to see what happened next!  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good edge of your seat read.

B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I read the book first.  It definitely does the book justice.  It was just as I would have envisioned it.
B006PTL1GC|5.0|I would especially recommend this movie for people who are into this subject. If you have some background, I'm guessing you'll find it even more enjoyable. But for a neophyte like me, it's a good way to see the history behind it. This film made me want to know more about this field! Besides, there's Keira Knightley, Viggo Mortensen, and Michael Fassbender with great performances, as usual.

B002FOQY2M|4.0|If you are tight on money, buy their second CD instead, called Some Nights. This group has been around for 10 years but just got recognition this January with a whopping 5 nominations and 2 wins at the Grammys, including Best New Artist. On Some Nights, you will recognize a song that is on a car commercial.Try to catch their videos as they are so full of energy. If you like music trivia, hit the internet and see their connection to Lena Dunham (GIRLS on HBO).
B00381A1MU|5.0|The Chuggington die cast Irving was a gift to my son for christmas, so we had to get the rubbish cars. He loves than it has a real magnet on it, and he can lift the rubbish from the car with it. He loves the show on tv so we've been trying to buy all the trains for him. The die cast trains are the best he hasn't been able to break one! Perfect for my 2 1/2 year old!

0913866156|5.0|Thoth is my all time favorite Tarot deck.  The paintings are rich, lively, strong and effective.  They are amazing representations of the concepts associated with Qabalistic Tarot and pathworking.<br /><br />Frieda Harris employed such a skillful hand in rendering the glowing landscapes and vistas associated with each card.  Her style is stately, noble, and totally magickal.<br /><br />One of my favorite cards is the High Priestess, who looks as if she is carved from glowing alabaster.<br /><br />IMHO, few other Tarots can capture the mystery and splendor of the Paths as beautifully as this deck does.<br /><br />I know some folks think its creepy, but I cant see that at all.  The images arent too different from the austere figures girding Rockerfeller Center.  They are majestic and commanding and transportingly gorgeous.<br /><br />Also, there was a complaint that this deck might be the infamous \\"green-tinted\\" Thoth deck that was printed back in the 1980s.<br /><br />I still have my green Thoth Deck from the 80s, and I can assure you that the Thoth Deck sold here by Amazon is absolutely NOT the green deck.<br /><br />The deck sold here is boldly colorful and richly hued.<br /><br />Its an absolute jewelry box of fantastic and colorful cards!!!<br /><br />I am giving this HIGH 5, and then some!!!!
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|The Man with the Iron Fists(released Nov/12)stars,among others,RZA,the blacksmith Thaddeus,Rick Yune as Zen-Yi,X-Blade,Russell Crowe as Jack Knife,Lucy Liu as Madam Blossom,David Bautista as Brass Body,Jamie Chung as Lady Silk,Cung Le as Bronze Lion,and Byron Mann as Silver Lion.This film is a throwback to the 60s and 70s Hong Kong films that have inspired many producers,directors and actors over the years.Those films were originally for the most part fantasies,some serious others not.Some could even be considered Chinese westerns.They made big stars out of many of the actors in their home countries.What we in North America saw was oft times poor,faded prints with horrible dubbings into English.They became a joke and the plots,to us,were mostly forgettable.They have been lampooned consistently over the years since.This film plays it all very straight but uses the same style as those old Hong Kong pictures.Unfortunately the story is as lame as any of the poorest Hong Kong films and drags interminably to the end.<br />The story finds the setting in China,in a time of feuding clans.The emperor has a shipment of gold traveling across the country and the head of the lion clan intends to protect it for him.However two of his underlings kill him and take over,and they scheme to steal the gold.Thrown into this mix is the son of the slain leader,X Blade,Jack Knife a mercenary British soldier who,with X Blade,converge on Jungle Town and meet up with a black,blacksmith,whose specialty is forging weapons of the finest calibre.<br />Since the lion clan is no longer in the picture the governor sends the Gemini squad to protect the gold.They arrive in the town with it and hunker down in the hotel/brothel run by Madam Blossom.The lion clan kill the Gemini`s and commandeer the gold.They also sever the blacksmiths arms,who ends up forging iron fists onto his stumps.He teams with Jack Knife and X Blade to try and take down the lion clan.The clan makes a deal with the madam,who has the gold in storage beneath the brothel.She knows its a promise they will never keep so she strikes back first by killing almost all of its members the night before they are to leave.<br />Arriving outside the city a platoon of well armed soldiers sent by the Emperor enters the town and are paused outside the brothel and ready to level it if the gold is not forthcoming.The three fight and defeat their enemies and Jack Knife,in the nick of time,appears to stop the soldiers from firing.The film ends as all three go their separate ways.In an epilogue X Blade`s wife is kidnapped by members of a bird clan and he must rescue her.He returns to the blacksmith for help.<br />As in the old Hong Kong films the fights usually don`t take much time to break out and this film is no different.It also uses those,now,cheesy stunts and close ups of faces distorted in rage to propel things along,like the old Hong Kong-ers(the memories just come flooding back!).When the fights resume in earnest near the end of the film at the climax,they now use a more modern style to stage them,with quick camera movement,action freezing and the like.In between we have this long and drawn out plot as each character and group are introduced.We even get back stories on some of the characters.One such borefest is the backdrop to the blacksmith`s story.As if things weren`t going slowly enough,they had to insert that story to slow things almost to a halt.If this film had been sending the entire Hong Kong genre up,or was doing it in a visually stylistic interpretation ala Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,this film may have stood some chance of being half decent.As it is,to actually have the nerve to play this thing ``straight``,is to commit filmic suicide.Sorry Mr.Diggs,this is bad.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scenes and some featurettes.This disc also contains the theatrical AND the extended versions.<br />All in all a film that fallstotally flat and into its Hong Kong rice bowl.If you,like I,were expecting a bit of imaginative tricks and style ala Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,then think again.Just because it has Tarantino`s name attached,doesn`t mean it is on Tarantino`s level.totally flat and into its Hong Kong rice bowl.If you,like I,were expecting a bit of imaginative tricks and style ala Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,then think again.Just because it has Tarantino`s name attached,doesn`t mean it is on Tarantino`s level.

0618918248|2.0|I was hoping this book would contain some strong supporting details for Atheism. Instead, (he even outlines this in the intro) Dawkins writes for people who want to get out of religion, but don't know how to do it. Dawkins is a great scientist and professor, but definitely NOT a philosopher. For that I would look to Nietzsche.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Great perspective about the origins of consciousness. I am a medical doctor as well and identified with the author about the challenges between reconciling God and the science we know about the human body. I remain a little skeptical about the explanations about why the authors brain could not have created the vivid encounter with the world beyond. Certainly there is some bias in his brain that already knew about angels and afterlife. Also as the cortex was recovering it could have generated the whole bit of imagery in a way that made the author think all these event happened over a week.<br /><br />I am a believer in a more logical explanation for God than what is currently present in main stream culture. This book is a wonderful analysis and proposes a great hypothesis about consciousness that I hope can be tested with further study.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I was hesitant to read it, given all the mixed reviews, but I am glad I did.....this is not your typical happy ending story....I sure hope there is a sequal coming....Amy is one twisted character and Nick could be any of us just caught up in a web of a \\"pshyco bi***\\" It was very well written and just when you thought this is what might happen next, you are totally taken the other way around! In the first part of the book, I did have the feeling that Amy was not all that she was telling us! Come on - I am a very easy going person, but the stuff she says she let her husband slide with, does not happen in a real marriage! This is not a \\"brainless\\" book nor an easy read but it is a must read for sure!

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app game is fun and addicting :) doesnt stop and want you to buy stuff every 45 sec which is great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple, easy to use, accurate, and free! What more can you ask for? To the creator, thank you very much!
B009O2XY12|3.0|I love bubble games but seriously this one was so done before and felt geared toward a child. I was annoyed that you couldn't play unless you invested real money and couldn't earn power any other real way. You had to stop to allow time for the game to &#34;charge&#34; up. How annoying. I deleted after an hour of play.
B008OOYALE|2.0|when I downloaded Dragon Story in August 2012, I enjoyed the graphics and the concept of the game.  Although one can play the game without spending hard cash, it proved very tempting to move things along in breeding and incubating the dragons.  In October 2012, Team Lava came out with the latest version of the game, New Dawn.  But now, in February 2013, this version is still not available for the Kindle Fire.  The changes with the New Dawn version make the game much more interesting and comparable to the version of Dragonvale available for free here at Amazon (I also play Dragonvale).<br /><br />One thing I have noticed about the Team Lava games is that moving things around is very clunky and frustrating.  Dragonvale doesn't have this problem so it seems that Team Lava needs to work on this issue.  Another issue is the need for neighbors at the lower levels of the game is justified in my mind by the need to earn more of the free coins since coins are being used up regularly.  At the higher levels, one's dragons are earning a lot more coin yet this maddening requirement for daily neighbor visits continues--using up a good chunk of one's daily time for a purpose that still eludes me in terms of game play.  This nonsense is completely missing in Dragonvale.  Another issue I had was the numbingly slow pace to clear the islands....at the higher levels it takes a week to clear a space the size of a quarter--even if one is sitting on millions of the free coins.  It was frustrating and annoying.  Dragonvale does not have this mind-numbing slow pace.  My final issue is the discussion forum Team Lava urges one to visit has become more and more useless for Kindle Fire users since the discussion now revolves around the New Dawn version.  This version is not available on the Kindle Fire but it is certainly colorfully visible as one visits neighbors who have an Ipad or an Iphone.  Being able to see what one cannot yet have makes things even more frustrating for Kindle Fire users.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and download Dragonvale if you are entranced with dragons.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Still the best play alone game going, relaxing,and good for an 85 year old mind.  Keeps it in good shape.

B004V5QWU2|1.0|We haven't figured the point of this yet. I think ant tv show works too. I uninstalled this. It might just be my lack of understanding
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Probably the most compeling session 1 I have seen since I watch the Wire.  Excited for season 2 to come out on Amazon
B007VUA7VO|2.0|I purchased this app with the expectation it should have come with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" in the first place. As for the battery charging within one-two hours is not accurate. Especially if you are using the Kindle at the same time. And if you do, it heats up quickly, limiting the use I get from my kindle. For my money, I can only gave a 2 rating on this product. I really enjoy my Kindle, I would just like a charger that simply charges like it should.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series.  Always compelling.  the dynamic between the front and back of the house will make you laugh, angry and even cry.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I Love Adobe reader. So easy to use. The accessibility features are easily available. I find the menu bar very easy to navigate. Being able to perform services so easily makes it fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife's customers told her about this series. Immediately fell head over hills into this series (multiple plots). My sister 700 miles away was watching this as well.  I was shocked with the Season 3 ending! Can't wait for Season 4 to begin. I would highly recommend to any one. I could not wait to see it on PBS so I bought the Season TV Pass. It was more than worth it!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This  book teaches people so many things that are so important and people don't even care about it.That kind of stuff makes me so mad.thank you for reading this article.
1616550414|5.0|Outstanding quality/content. Well made and lots of artwork that I've never seen before. Worth at least three times what it costs.
B007QUUIEA|3.0|Was quite good but the main character appears to be confused about certain aspects of teenage life and this makes his view long winded at times.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|awsome story lines and plots. amazing actions. i like the part that zombies against humans, i hope they make more seasons for this show, it has great prospect of having long running show.
B004Q9TK98|4.0|The story had many twists and turns, some of them more unbelievable than concievable. It was not a confusing story, although in my opinion it ended too fast!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Alcuni bug con android (pulizia del paddok e \\"creazione\\" dei pasti). È come se il touch non fosse tarato bene. Difficoltà nel.reperire le gemme. L'energia si \\"consuma\\" troppo velocemente. Per il resto un ottima app con una grafica stupenda. Da scaricare. In ogni caso aspetto un aggiornamento.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Way better than the first!!!!! One of the best apps ever!!! Definitely get it!!!!<br />I Love it!!!! not a waste.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun....Addictive.....Scenes are very colorful and sounds are cute.......My 4 year old enjoys it...keeps him entertained when traveling, at the doctors office etc...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a very cool and addicting game, but it can sometimes be frustrating. I personally think of the game as something that you would play for a while, then get bored and/or frustrated with and play some thing else. But Don't get me wrong it is a very very fun addicting game so you should get it.
B004ZQRFGM|4.0|Popovic's most recent release may very well be her all time best.  This is a really solid album all the way through that shows off her vocal range, guitar prowess, and songwriting skills better than many of her earlier releases.  She plays the blues, but also incorporates a significant amount of jazz, soul and rock in places.  She really shows off the guitar on this one including a great little duet with Sonny Landreth on \\"Slideshow\\".  The album was recorded in New Orleans and there is a definite influence on the sound of the album.  Tracks like \\"Voodoo Woman\\" come from the Tab Benoit school of Louisiana blues.  Popovic keeps improving and although I still don't think she may have made the album that she is capable of making, this one is really good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games in the app store once you start you never want to stop get this game
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I recommend you buy this book in Kindle/Nook format because you WILL need a convenient dictionary to be able to enjoy the nuances Taleb enjoys to convey his points. However, it's worth your initial round of 'whad-he-say?&#34; because after you begin to explore each section, you'll soon realize that Taleb's opinions and research generate from some of the finest minds in the world and he drives his points home with hammers. Plus, Taleb is very funny and his personality is so unique that I found myself falling in love with him and his courage and tenacity to take on academia, big Pharm, the medical profession, health, big corporations, today's media, food, and government. Plus, it was great fun to see him take on people whose work he disrespects; his flair and vitriol was something to behold. As an aside, his suggestions on eating and exercise are profound! I took his suggestions and have lost five pounds since I finished reading the book last week.<br /><br />As an innovator/inventor/artist, I learned that my life and my work are ANTIFRAGILE. The more Black Swans that occur, the more successful my invention will become because I have no 'downside' and (perhaps) unlimited upside. That concept (new to me) was very uplifting.<br /><br />Only read this book if you are ready to see the world differently. You may not agree with everything in Taleb's book, but there is no way you can disagree with the power and integrity of his work and the brilliance of his mind.<br /><br />- Phyllis Davis, Co-inventor, Portable Farms Modular Aquaponics Systems (patent pending)
B007P7QVC2|5.0|this book is easy to understand and it's good to read. i bought the used one, but it is still very new and it is very cheap
0765325950|4.0|Well, that was a bit disappointing. More than a bit actually... Based on my ratings for the other books, it appears this is my least favorite book in the series and that is a tragedy.<br /><br />The set-up in The Gathering Storm and Towers of Midnight was brilliant. The ground was prepared for a brilliant conclusion, but it just kind of fell flat unfortunately. The actual ending was rushed and some plot lines were given short shrift.<br /><br />I don't know that I've ever said a Wheel of Time book could have been shorter because I have enjoyed their length and their depth, but it seems that where A Memory of Light had the length, it was lacking the depth that made this series truly great.<br /><br />Here are a few examples of what's wrong with the book (IMHO):<br /><br />***SPOILERS BELOW***<br /><br />* Where was the payoff of the Tinkers finally finding their song? Loial sings a song of growing during the Last Battle, but it's never mentioned again. I thought this would signal the coming of what had been a consistent question throughout the series.<br />* Padan Fain? He gets how much page time here? 12 pages? 15? And his threat is extinguished just like that?!? It felt like an after thought. It felt obvious, and that's just a shame for the most terrifying villain of the series.<br />* Speaking of quick endings--Lanfear. Enough said.<br />* Gawyn? Then Galad? THEN Lan? Did we really need to see all three take the exact same foolish action just to prove to the WoT community that Lan is the best swordsman? Didn't we already know that? And what's with generals agreeing to fight a foe one-on-one? It's a level of pride that strikes me as unrealistic. But maybe that's just me.<br />* What about Elayne's babies? We don't get to see them?<br />* What's most frustrating about how quickly some things get wrapped up is how long it takes others to see the same. The Perrin vs. Slayer conflict gets dragged out for 3 or 4 epic struggles between the two. Cut out one of those and give both Fain and Lanfear more fitting build-ups and conclusions.<br />* It seems the length of this book was intended to show us things we should have already known, like: Mat as the supreme battlefield genius EVER.<br /><br />Disappointing.ive both Fain and Lanfear more fitting build-ups and conclusions.<br />* It seems the length of this book was intended to show us things we should have already known, like: Mat as the supreme battlefield genius EVER.<br /><br />Disappointing.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|There were lots of Interesting twists and turns--but the subject matter too real for my taste.  I would recommend for easy reading.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|Didn't think I'd be able to write much in this app but I use it everyday. It works so well with the Swype kindle keyboard I can do long extensive writing binges tirelessly.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I got really far but then it deleted my data I felt I was so far I might as well get rid of it so I did
B0072IVGZG|4.0|I'm a casual The Cult fan. I like some older songs here and there, but was only inspired to buy a full length with 'Beyond Good and Evil' (which I think is 4 stars, too). My favorite song by them is 'Painted on My Heart' from the Gone in Sixty Seconds soundtrack. I didn't care for their last cd 'Born into This' -- just didn't care for the songwriting. Just a little background to frame my opinion, in case you are in the same boat as me (not a die-hard old school Cult fan).<br /><br />With all of that said, I found this CD to be right on par with 'Beyond Good and Evil' and I enjoy it. Solid slab of rock. The production is modern and thick, the vocals sound great and the songwriting is back on track.<br /><br />***The version that Amazon sent me was the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" even though the description/track listing didn't indicate that is what I would be sent. BONUS! Came with a bonus CD of 4 additional songs, which are just as good as the rest of the cd.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I heard a lot of buzz about Downton Abbey so I downloaded all three seasons and caught up in a week! I love it!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I have always liked these games since diner dash. Had them on my pc now I love using touch for it on my kindle. Great game!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game has it ups and downs, but slowly it me learn to like it and develop what I had going. It is fun
B00181JGI2|2.0|This was one of the most boring films I've seen.  Jeff Bridges was good as usual, but he had nothing to work with script-wise.
B00846F1YW|1.0|After a somewhat confusing start, as the game sets you off to find glasses, not mentioning that you need to go through a bunch of other items first, I finally got to the end of chapter 1. Sadly, that marked the end of the game, as to advance it all appears to require you to spam your Facebook/Twitter account to continue. Unable and uninterested in doing that I could get no further. Other then  I find the graphics off putting, as they are realistic, yet somehow they feel off, and the user interface is mediocre. As such the game is worthless to me and was promptly uninstalled.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|simple and addictive... colorful too! I like to play before bed to relax and de-stress. my fav match three game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The narrative between the two sides hooked me from the very beginning. I could not put the book down and I loved the way the plot kept you guessing. I did not see the end coming and honestly I'm still trying to decide if I like or dislike how the book ended. Read it or yourself!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A very nice game that helps kids practice taking care of something. I gave my girl this app and now, she has a fish 2 dogs and a cat.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book was great, I read it off and on whenever I had time and had it knocked out in 2 days. Meaty story great adventure.<br /><br />The King's blades by Dave Duncan was pretty good and similar - this blew it away.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was a little concerned to get the trilogy on Kindle because it can sometimes be difficult to navigate.  This one is really well done.  The books speak for themselves and are wonderful.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|WHAT MORE CAN ONE ADD TO ALL THE DESERVING ACCOLADES HEAPED UPON DOWNTON ABBEY. IT IS INTELLIGENT AND ENTERTAINING. EACH ACTOR SEEMS PERFECTLY SUITED FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES. MAGGIE SMITH IS SUCH FUN TO WATCH. STORY-LINES AND PLOTS ARE FIRST RATE.<br /><br />BECAUSE I BOUGHT MY 1,2,3 SERIES FROM AMAZON.CO.UK, I HAVE THE SEASON FINALE PURCHASED AS A SEPARATE DVD. (THEY ARE GIVING THE FINALE FREE AS A PART OF SERIES 3 HERE IN NORTH AMERICA.) ALONG WITH U.K. SERIES 3, THEY SENT FOR FREE, THE DOWNTON ABBEY 2013 DAILY DIARY WITH EACH PAGE CONTAINING A LARGE GLOSSY PHOTO OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS AND/OR SCENES FROM THE SERIES. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE GIVING THE DIARY FREE HERE IN N.A.<br /><br />I HAVE VIEWED EACH SERIES 4-5 TIMES AS I AM SURE MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALSO. THIS PRODUCTION IS SO RICH WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE TIMES, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, CLOTHING, DECOR & FURNISHINGS, AS WELL AS THE MIND SETS OF THE DAY, ETC. DOWNTON WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE TOP TELEVISION SHOWS EVER.<br /><br />I BOUGHT THE WONDERFUL KEEPSAKE BOOK, \\"DOWNTON ABBEY CHRONICLES\\". WRITTEN BY JESSICA FELLOWES, AND THE PAPERBACK \\"Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey: The Lost Legacy of Highclere Castle [Paperback]\\" BOTH ARE AVAILABLE HERE ON AMAZON.COM. LADY ALMINA'S STORY ITSELF IS UNUSUAL AND VERY INTERESTING.<br /><br />SERIES 3 ENDS WITH SUCH A CLIFF HANGER THAT LEFT ME STUNNED. WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SERIES 4. AND THAT'S THE IDEA EH?

B001V5CIHQ|5.0|This was the very best version I have seen of Peter Pan yet! Peter and Wendy had such chemistry and Tink was adorable too. Hook was an appropriate swarmy kind of guy with snake-ish charm as well. Great movie for the whole family!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|At first I wondered if I should see this film at the Patio Theater in Chicago today. Since I was not sure I took a look at amazon and saw the 43 five star ratings. It must be good? It is amazing, fantastic, it's a terrific film that has spirit and feeling for how love of music is art and craft from the work and talent of those who truly love it.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Great game very inventive &amp; love the artistry.  I never laughed so hard playing a game had to pass on the information so others may think so too
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so addicted to Downton Abbey. It is the best thing on television and I love going back to watch it.
B006M4RN3U|1.0|All you need to know this CD is that it is recorded and mixed using Autotune to make a a bunch of 30 year old dudes sound like 13 year old boys so they can sell their CD to 13 year old girls.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing Amy is right! This book is so twisted that it's great! I could not put it down. It's a must read!!!!!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|my sonn loves this game. had to buy the extra pack o it, but it was well worth it. out of all the kid apps this is definatley one of the best.
B008X6N1OA|2.0|I had to order and return two copies of the 3D DVD beacse it would not run well on my Tv and player. It seems that they may have had a bad patch. Other 3D DVDs work great, so i know its not the player. The regular blu ray 2D works fine
1451695195|5.0|This book is interesting and easy reading. This is an amazing story written with passion.  Maybe he'll write a followup.
B0095P29EG|5.0|This is a movie that I can watch over and over again. Great story line and action packed. It tells you that blood is always thicker than water.
B005KELQEU|3.0|I find that this serves it's purpose and plan on upgrading once I purchase the Kindlefire HD. The case does provide the necessary protection that the screen needs.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a game that I find addicting and I am glad there are so many quests. I am hoping that eventually I'll have enough things for a unicorn eventually. I would recommend for someone who has time to kill.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Having been involved with this type of electronics in the past, I was impressed at how Steve Jobs could motivate people to perform above and beyond what they had thought they were capable of. Apple needs another Steve Jobs.
B00797MB0O|4.0|As always, Charlize delivers a well thought, emotional (not operatic) performance. The subject is uncomfortable at times (who doesn't cringe at a social faux pas), but the ending is awesome, and perhaps a lesson to some. She is gorgeous and sexy in this movie. Worth a look.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|This book opens a completely different picture that I had grown accustom with in the U.S. government. Oliver Stone raises a lot of questions which I intend to research further.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this truly was an absolutely amazing story, from the moment I started reading this book, I could not put it down.  This was an unbelievable read and this book is definitely in my all time top 5 books.  I loved the characters, and loved the story, it was not at all what I expected, but so much better.  The book at times was an emotional ride but I loved every minute of reading it.  It is one of those books that I will talk about and recommend for a very long time!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Had a hard time getting into it.  I usually like a book to capture my attention before I am half way through.  The details were a little gory for my taste.
0312117337|5.0|I put off getting this deck for a long time, I'd look at the pictures and wonder if it was for me. But I finally decided to order it and I could not be happier. I love the artwork(including the card backs!), and the book that comes with it has great explanations for the cards. The book is also very easy to navigate for quickly looking up the cards.<br />This deck is like a fresh perspective in my opinion, of the Tarot. I have studied Tarot intently for quite some time and I have to say that even the pictures on the cards gave me a new perspective on the card meanings. Especially for the court cards, which can be tricky to understand...with this deck they are easy for me to understand, because they tend to talk about certain traits right up rather than a picture of a person. Also I appreciate how my understanding of the aces has been expanded by using Osho Zen Tarot. Since receiving this deck I have hardly used my other decks, I just really love this one!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is the next 'Lord of the rings', only from an American. Same feel, battle love, good , evel only with sex. COOL.

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Pure delight from start to finish.  Breaks your heart, leaves you crying, and then comforts, soothes, and wipes away your tears. Deeply moving and inspiring. Brilliant performances by John Hawkes and Helen Hunt.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the depression era feel with grit of Naziism and survival. The movie is great as well, I was surprised.

B009V3KKXY|5.0|GREAT book. J.D. did a great heck of a job. I love para-cord and know somethings but I learned SO much from this book.
B00B3MN65K|4.0|This CD is so much better than Illuminations.  I plan on seeing Josh in concert this year. The last time I saw him was on the Awake tour. My favorites are Un Alma Mas and I Believe. I still wish there were a couple songs on here that show off his voice like Un Dia Llegara and February Song. However, All That Echoes will be spending alot of time in my car's CD player and its already loaded on my computer at work. I think I will go get some coffee and give it a listen right now!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|GREAT READ. I wasn't sure of this, but as a fan of the show, I thought OK. but WOW what a great book. The ghost writer is great.
B008476HBM|3.0|It was a good book, I like the story line, but I'm not a big fan of the 18th Century English language, I found it very hard to understand some of the statments that the character were making, I had to reread them several times.<br /><br />This was a assignment for class, is really the only reason I read it, but I did enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the depression era feel with grit of Naziism and survival. The movie is great as well, I was surprised.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I'd heard good things about the series, so I decided to give it a shot.  The plot & premise are OK if a bit far-fetched, Reacher's character is enjoyable, and the peripheral characters Childs bothers to develop are also decent.  The two main flaws are, first, an over-reliance on 'dues ex machina' type moments where Reacher pulls off something not very believable to get out of an untenable situation, or where the opposition strikes without explanation as to how they know to do so.  Second, the action scenes, hand-to-hand fights in particular, are very poorly done.  The sequence of strikes, results of strikes, and general structure of the fights read like they're written to overwhelm you with details because the author doesn't actually understand them.  Of course, authors often have to write about or include details in their stories in areas where they don't have personal expertise, but when the premise of the book naturally leads to lots of fighting I would have expected at least better research.<br />It's not just that the fight itself is difficult to follow or doesn't make much sense; Reacher's character then often spends a significant amount of time thinking back on how lucky he was that X did or didn't happen and how that saved his life - even when, in reality, X would have made little to no difference.  As someone with extensive martial arts experience as both a student and an instructor, I'm clearly not the typical reader in this regard.  Still, it's disappointing that violence is core part of the storyline and not well-depicted.<br />I read the second book as well and found that, while the characters continue to be enjoyable, there's no improvement in the handling of the fight scenes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really like this book, I only read it because it was so popular but I read it within 1 day and started the second one right away.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The story was good but I like a good ending and this book didn't have one. I wish I hadn't read it.
B009AY04A8|4.0|A good game in all. some of the graphics are hard to see when you are searching for them and somewhat difficult to figure out. Especially the scrambled words at first but all in all a good nice relaxing game that helps to pass the time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story is somewhat unbelievable and I didn't enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend it because it has a bad ending.
0061733199|5.0|This book is very helpful! It teaches you what is needed to survival in the outdoors!  I recommend this book to everyone~
B00563K3DA|4.0|ENjoyed the fable.  Book has suggestions for improving your well being and grtting involved with family and that there i more to lif than the job/career that we seem to lose ourselves in.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Being a Clancy fan for many years I just couldn't get my head around the fact that Jack Jr., being the son of an American President, could take an active part in a black op in China without being recognized.
B006LSZECO|4.0|IDK. I saw the reviews, People Magazine?, and got it on Kindle. Fascinating read, but maybe the same thing that bothers me about Jonathen Franzen's books: somewhat cold. But I liked it good enough to read author's earlier books, which I liked better!  I would recommend all her books.
0345803485|2.0|This was barely even amusing at a minimum. I couldnt even finish it. I was surprised because I at least stuck it out and finished all the twilight books out of sheer determination but this book didnt even have good steamy sex scenes. Such a disappointment.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I haven't read mystery/thrillers in years. If there are more like this, I'm in.  A modern thriller for a modern audience.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|Very little plot in this movie. Some great actors that are portrayed in lesser roles. Wouldn't suggest watching. Two more words.
B0027MJU00|5.0|But then I really got into it. I found all the characters intersting. No doubt some far fetched plot stuff, but I am OK with it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was disappointing as a follow up to the first 2 Hunger Games books, which I loved.  It seemed to drag on, and pages were being filled with words just to a decent sized book out of it.  That sounds somewhat harsh, but I did not hate it.  It was just such a contrast to the first two....
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Finished the series recently; thought 'the Hunger Games' was very good (a bit simplistic, perhaps, but I understand these are generally classified as teen literature). The second, 'Catching Fire,' had the vague feeling to it that the publisher suggested a continuation after the first did so well. The third was just plain long winded, with an ending so storybook perfect that I almost gagged.<br /><br />Really not much need to read 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay,' after 'the Hunger Games' unless you're really into these stories.<br /><br />Otherwise, it doesn't take much imagination to guess where things are headed.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Awesome, what else can you say?  Journey is great and I loved having the other 2 with all the bonus features.  Best game purchase ever.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A friend at work told me about this series.  She said I would love it and she was right!  Love, love, love it!
B004HD61KE|5.0|I really enjoyed the historical perspective combined with a mystery/thriller genre.  The combination of supervolcano, lost tribes of Israel, Lewis and Clark, and our founding fathers was fascinating.
B000EWBKK8|4.0|This is one of my favorites from the past several years. The story moves along steady, even though it isn't an action-packed thriller. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is great and the story is interesting. Nicolas Cage, Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke are excellent in their respective roles. I highly recommend!
B0056BMK6K|4.0|Hmmmm, I'm interested to see how his method works in application. Good thing about the book was it was concise, gave me a lot to think about and provided examples. One thing to keep in mind is having more then one book you are marketing will probably make this method easier.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Well written, moved quickly without predictable outcome. A very loving story with strong characters. Subject matter of incest was handled  kindly, if that's possible.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first time that I have read anything by Colleen Hoover and I LOVED this book.  Fantastic Book!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a great game. it is kid friendly. and what made it better was is that it is like one of those facebook games
B00846F1YW|1.0|Got through 2 levels &amp; it wouldn't continue unless I posted to Faceborg.<br />Too lame to merit the three dollar price tag, they insult me by making me a non-consentual shill.<br /><br />uninstalling this garbage right now.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a fun app for all ages. I recommend it! peaceful fun. it is good for developing hand eye coordination as well as task completion.  Small children may need some help navigating.
B00422LESO|5.0|Shannon Hale's Austenland was the sort of book that made me start thinking about who I'd recommend it to as soon as I finished it.  It also made me smile every time I thought of it for at least a week.<br /><br />Initially, the book description caused me to have fairly low expectations.  I expected it to be fluffier than my usual read.  I like very few spin offs on the work of established authors.  Though Austenland was clearly inspired by Austen's work, it was also a completely contemporary story.  On the one hand, that made it way more acceptable to me than a costume drama dealing with the fringes of the Darcy/Bennett menage; on the other, it could easily have incorporated all the worst excesses of ze dreaded chick lit.  In my few encounters with the genre, it seemed to be populated by women characters who repeatedly and unnecessarily embarrass themselves and me as well. Yet, in spite of the  potentially cringe-worthy set-up, Austenland manages to avoid this particular pit-fall.<br /><br />Our heroine, Jane Hayes admits at the outset that she is besotted with Austen's work, especially Pride and Prejudice, and most particularly with Mr. Darcy as portrayed by Colin Firth.  Plagued with a series of unfortunate relationships, she despairs of ever meeting her own Mr. Darcy.  An elderly and understanding relative stages a posthumous intervention by bequeathing Jane an all expense paid trip to Penwood, an Austenesque fantasy vacation destination in England.  Jane decides to accept her great aunt's challenge before subsiding into resigned spinsterhood.<br /><br />Austenland is told from Jane's point of view, though not in the first person, and it is Jane's honesty, her confusion, and her dry wit that make this book work.  As a character and as an observer of others, Jane seeks understanding of her own obsessions and of her companions' roles and motivation. And Jane is funny.  More than once I was startled into the dreaded snort-laugh, but it was always with Jane not at her.  Nor is Jane the only source of humor in the novel.  Just the names given the role players is enough to stain a page with droplets of coffee.  Mrs. Wattlesbrook, Miss Charming, and, best of all, Mr. Nobley. (Now is that \\"o\\" long or short?)  Miss Charming, in particular, has some snicker-worthy lines.  Aside from their names and dialogue, each character gives Jane's powers of observation a lively workout and proves her a worthy reflection of her namesake.<br /><br />It is clear from the beginning that Penwood is not to be the full immersion experience that Jane expects.  As Jane Erstwhile, she is equipped with an appropriate wardrobe and given a whirlwind tour of the rules and regs, but her accommodations are not primitively historic.  This layering of the authentic with the frankly faux causes Jane to constantly question the nature of truth and fantasy, and she finds that sorting one from the other is hard.  Yet this constant drive to analyze her experiences is what eventually leads Jane to change and grow.<br /><br />The tale of Jane's adventures is punctuated with brief accounts of each of her failed romances.  While some of these episodes are indeed embarrassing, I don't think any of them reaches the squirmiest depths of humiliation.  Instead, one tends to empathize with Jane and look for patterns that aren't necessarily there.  I found that the sum effect of these interludes was to make me root for Jane all the more strongly.  In the present, Jane at first looks within herself to find the source of her failures, until her experiences finally lead her to seek and acknowledge her strengths as well..  And, of course, the whole Austenland experience is fraught with hints and teasing suggestions of romance.  Jane struggles to find the balance between autonomy and romance throughout the story.  For Jane and the reader alike, the big question regarding romance as well as every other aspect of Austenland remains: Is it real; is it illusion; or is it perhaps just wishful thinking?  The answer....<br /><br />Well, of course, I'm not giving the answer.  I'll just refer you to my first paragraph and say that I read the last chapter three times. And smiled.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|It plays ok, but pieces are not well enough defined,  I found some initial confusion existed between bishops and queen:soon cleared it up.  I'd like it better if use of clock was optional.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Nothing reminds me of jr high/ high school like John Hughes films and this one is no different. I think I learned to master the art of skipping school from Ferris. The message to take time out and enjoy life is timeless and one we should all pay more attention to.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is a must for anyone who wants to direct publish a book on Kindle. It is very clear and helpful--and free!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is one of the most inspirational books that I have ever read. The depth of wisdom and compassion is thought provoking.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Harry Bosch is one of my favorites and these shorts don't disappoint. leaves you wanting more, much more. I recommend to any reader who aren't yet familiar with Harry Bosch and anyone who has lived in L.A.
B003D81NVQ|4.0|Suspenseful, thrilling and difficult to quite watching. Very worthwhile, can't wait for Season 4 to arrive in the ned few days
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There is a large selection of various games, some challenging, some not so challenging. the downside is having to wait to unlock them all and you only start out with ten games.
B0086700CM|2.0|app works well on my iphone but dosen't work well on my son's tablet not sure why but it doesn't move well
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I missed some of the episodes on demand by the cable service.  Was happy that I could see them with my prime membership.  Tried Hulu plus, but episodes not available.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing!!!!This is one of the best games I have ever played!!!The game is way better than Temple Run 2
B008MEM24S|4.0|I liked the challenge of the game.It is very addictive can't quit playing the game.I will continue to play the game over again.
B004U8VWIM|1.0|Horrible movie - would have given it zero stars if that was possible - unrealistic, stupid, poorly conceived, poorly executed
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is a great addition to the hidden object collection I have. It's great for Kinde Fire HD. Big screens really help with the hidden object games. Small screens might have a hard time with these. Hope this helps.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Awesome book great adventure and more in this exciting action packed book but make sure you read the rest of the series first
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I big time recommend you get this game I LOVE it :D I spend so much time on it .it is super fun!
B003SHUMRI|4.0|Movie was very entertaining and the dancing was excellent.  My major complaint is that the story line is just way too cliche.
B000ID1J5E|3.0|If I were to give a rating for the scenery and the filming it would be five stars. However the story and the acting don't rate more that three stars. Having said that, the story held my interest to the end and I found that as the movie progressed it got better as far as the acting. So it is just okay, but if you like Montana scenery or the mountains or river rafting, I highly recommend watching.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very much enjoyed...most of us know of God's blessing...but nice for non-believers to have an opportunity for some insight as well.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|As others have said, the graphics and music in this game are quite nice.  The early levels give hints about what you are supposed to do so you don't have to guess. The idea is to guide the sleepwalker while he collects stars and moons. Every \\"dream\\" has a set amount to collect. To guide the sleepwalker you have to move things that are in front of him. Some move up and down, some side to side, some rotate.  If the sleepwalker crashes or falls he looses some of the stars he has collected. This game looks so easy but it is hard to get to the end of each dream with everything collected.  I found myself trying the same level multiple times to get the perfect score.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phil is just simply phabulous! Love his music and his voice. He will only get better as time goes on!
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|The CD label showed one song which wasn't on the label.  But Amazon did give me a $1 credit for a mp3 download.  But that doesn't help when I want to play this in my car.<br /><br />I liked 75%  the songs on the CD and thoroughly enjoy the show.  If you are buying a gift for someone who likes the series - this is must buy for them.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love Pride and Prejudice. I love Jane Austen and I simply wanted to add another 5 star review to this free version for it's awesomeness.<br /><br />Cheers.
B00B10ENBA|2.0|I can't understand why I feel so differently from everyone about this movie.  All I heard were good things, so despite a very average trailer I rented Argo.  It was indeed as average, as cliche, as contrived as I expected.  We all know the ending, but I was assured that it would still be suspenseful and gripping.  It was not.  I'm sure all the things that happened on the tarmac are made up.  I'm sure the ringing and ringing and ringing telephone at production offices was made up.  All these amateur devices to pep up the story and play to American audiences, the strange and incomplete story about Affleck and his family (it seemed like they wanted to go somewhere with it and then abandoned it), the exaggerated hair and make-up - it was all so . . .  did I already say amateurish?  I cannot  believe this country or the Hollywood community might actually take this film and bestow upon it all accolades that I strongly feel should go to Lincoln.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very, very good. I love this post-apocalyptic genre and the young adults being the central figures in it all. I can't say enough about how good it is. And I don't have to, all the reviewers before me have said it all.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It is always a pleasure to read Lee child. His plots usually move you right along.<br />His characters are usually believable. Since I am not as knowledgeable about counterfeiting, I was not as disturbed as the other reviewer was. My advice to him/her is stop reading Lee Child's books . Better yet, blog him and share your vast info with him. I am sure he will welcome your expertise.
B009NSHZLW|3.0|It will load and run on my ARCHOS 70 IT- however it won't run .VOB files..<br />Please add these files to your product, to make it even better.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Ever been watching a TV show and it starts playing a song in the background and you wonder what song it is?  This app will tell you (it will also tell you what TV show you are watching).<br /><br />Tomshardware had an article on how this works; and I still do not fully understand.  Has to do with graphing the music mathematically in three space.  But who cares?  Not only does this app tell you the song and artist, but it will also show you the lyrics in sync with the song (newer songs only).  This is truly amazing-- the app will not only recognize most classical pieces; it will often tell you the artist and/or orchestra.  How does it do that- how does it know which version of the 100's of recordings of Beethoven's 5th is playing?<br /><br />This is a must have app.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|As a teacher of high ability 6th grade students, I was naturally drawn to this book, Outliers: The Story of Success, by Malcolm Gladwell.  I’m always more than curious about what my former students make of their lives.  One of the most rewarding parts of my job is when I reconnect with them on down the road.  But what is an outlier?<br />“Outlier - noun \-ˌlī(-ə)r\<br />1.  : something (as a geological feature) that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body<br />2.  : a statistical observation that is markedly different in value from the others of the sample”<br /><br />So begins the introduction to this book, about the best, the brilliant, the most successful, and what makes them so.  Research to support the nature vs. nurture question.  And, alas, it is both,  ”…they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot.”<br /><br />But this book is more fascinating than just that.  Did you know it takes 10,000 hours to become a master at a skill?  Yes, 10,000 hours.  I found myself  mentally calculating the number of hours I have spent sewing or reading or teaching, or doing any other single skill.  Have you ever thought about how cultural differences can critically affect air traffic controllers’ or pilots’ and copilots’ communications?  Or what dominant hockey players have in common?  How does the year you were born impact the chances of your success in a certain area?
B000YHG72E|3.0|I watched this because it is my Granddaughter's favorite christmas movie.  I don't know why, but it is.  I would much rather see Miracle on 34th st or Bing Crosby's White christmas, but it was fairly cute.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|I never got into the White Stripes. 1 guitar, 1 drummer...seemed kind of Gimicky. But, I may have to go back and get those albums too now. Jack White grabbed my attention when I saw him with Jimmy Page and The Edge in the rock/doc &#34;It's gonna get loud.&#34; This is a GREAT record. I can't peg the style (country/rock/rap/punk/blues..?) There hasn't been a brilliant blending of styles like this since Beck...
B007KQI1NA|5.0|We bought a few to test out and we came back for more!  Folks from other departments love it too.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Album does it again this story is surely to be one of my favorite books. I believe this is a great book and makes you reflect on your own life and our world around us
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Loved it when it was on, got a Prime trial membership just to stream it again.  Worked great and enjoyed it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book!  I wasn't sure what to expect considering all of the hype and attention it got because of the sexual content - but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it and how much I looked forward to the next two books.  It's a sweet love story and you really become invested in the characters.<br /><br />I'll definately read the series again!
B006CLTFP2|4.0|I bought it for one song and found that I enjoy the whole album. I recomend this to anyone who likes something a littie different.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is probably one of the best texting apps for the kindle fire. I really like using it because you can tell when the person has read your messages and when they are typing. Plus, its really quick sending and receiving messages which i love. One thing that i suggest is just being able to type in a key word to find someone instead of having to type their exact username. But, it doesnt affect my view on this great app and i suggest u get it.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful movie that does an outstanding job at bringing the excellent story of the book to life in a way faithful to the original material.  The story unfolds in the same way in the movie as it does in the book so this is a very satisfying Harry Potter movie. The casting is fantastic. In particular,Richard Harris was a PERFECT Dumbledore. Alan Rickman's performance as Snape was on an O+ level as well. And John Willams score for this movie is a treasure to behold. My favorite movie theme music ever! I go with 4 stars instead of 5 only because the visual effects were subpar (they would be fantastic in all 7 other HP movies). I strongly recommend this movie!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutey love this show!  I purchased it for my kindle.  I would look forward to getting home so I could spend the evening at Downton Abbey.
B000W746GK|5.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantastic movie in and of itself. But the true beauty of Chamber of Secrets is that it is the most faithful to the book of all the Harry Potter movies. When I walked out of the theater after seeing Chamber os Secrets for the 1st time,the feeling of fulfillment I had inside of me was amazing. In Chamber of Secrets,we see the world that was created for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone given a story with more emotional depth to it. Students begin to be attacked at Hogwarts and Harry,Ron,and Hermione try to solve the mystery,but Harry is under suspicion himself. And Hermione finds herself in danger because of her parentage. And even some of the adult characters,such as Hagrid and Dumbledore,face significant adversity in the situation. Lucius Malfoy is a strong dark character whose ruthlessness is so brilliantly portrayed by Jason Issacs. And this film is more intense than Sorcerer's Stone,especially in the battle in the Chamber of Secrets itself. You can REALLY feel the tension between Harry and Tom Riddle. I was also pleased to see John Williams excellent music from Sorcerer's Stone make a return in Chamber of Secrets. Finally,the visual effects are much improved over Sorcerer's Stone.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a wonderful movie that is absolutely faithful to the book and certainly deserves 5 stars.

0812984412|2.0|_Cloud Atlas_ is a series of six short stories, each one told part of the way through.  The rest of the incompleted stories are then placed in reverse order with each one then told to the end.  David Mitchell's creativity consists of narrating each tale in a completely different writing style from any of the other stories, e.g. one is a seafaring narrative, another is pure science fiction involving clones vs. real people (pure bloods), while another is a mystery tale.  My two favorite stories involve an \\"accidental\\" but permanent internment of a man in a rest home, and the other is a series of letters written by a bisexual musical composer, whose major piece utilizes the name of this book.  The stories are supposedly loosely connected to each other; each story makes reference to another one in the book.<br /><br />Without going deeply into the plots of the stories, I often found myself losing track of what was going on in each of the narratives.  One story begins a sentence, then abruptly stops, only to resume a couple of a hundred pages later.  By then, I had completely forgotten what had occurred in this story.  I found that creativity is not necessarily a satisfactory substitute for coherent story telling.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is awesome but there is one glitches every time I get an evolution it freezes please fix this or is it just my computer... I recommend you to buy this game now! sereously
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I'm not sure why this game is so popular... other than all the chat and hook up attempts (which you can turn off, but why when the game is so dull! lol). More than one game,  the boards are tiny, Bingo's are rare and there seems to be other stuff going on (collecting of objects?) but no explanation as to why or any type of incentive. I'll be looking for a new Bingo ap. This one is just blah.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|I absolutely love The Lord Of The Rings. So when I heard that The Hobbit would be coming out I was a little bit worrited that I wouldn't like it. So I went to see and fell in love with it. Its a great movie.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is one of my must-see Holiday movies (every year). I couldn't find it on TV or satellite or Netflix this year, so I had to buy it. It is on the must-see list with It's a Wonderful Life, both versions of Miracle on 34th Street, Meet me in St. Louis, While You Were Sleeping, and White Christmas. I would give each of them a five!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits and Scandal are the best shows on TV today! ... what more can be said? ... I watch very little TV because of the quality of the shows, but these two are good!

B0055MBQOM|2.0|I have a high end NEC monitor with an x-rite calibration  system that came with the monitor.  Unfortunately the calibration software that came with the monitor is proprietary and could not be used with my new laptop, so I bought the inexpensive x-rite system.<br /><br />First problem was installation.  When restarting my computer after installation, I got a message saying that the computer could not find a certain dll file.  A tried removing and reinstalling the softrware a couple of times with the same result.  I sent a query to Xrite and received a note to remove all McAfee files and they provided a tool to do so.  That worked.<br /><br />After calibration I compared the results with my calibrated NEC monitor.  The colors were not bad, but the brightness and contrast were way off.  This was fixed in the Nvidea panel.  However, the colors are acceptably close to my NEC but identical.<br /><br />Since I don't use my laptop for critical photoediting, I will keep the product since it is a pain to return it.  However, I would not recommend this for anyown who wants to do critical photoediting.
1451695195|3.0|A very bright doctor (neurosurgeon) goes into a coma for a week and comes out of it remembering all sorts of things about 'heaven', i.e., he has a near death experience (NDE).<br />The first part of the book, in which he describes the clinical aspects of his coma-causing infection, is interesting. In the second part he describes what happens to him during his NDE. And that's sort of interesting as well although one wonders how he could remember it in such exact detail.  But in the next part, beginning with chapter 33, he starts talking about consciousness and quantum mechanics.  It's as if he's showing off a little bit, I mean, he is a neurosurgeon, but I never quite figured out how it fit with the NDE unless he is saying that consciousness doesn't reside in the brain since his was an out of body experience.<br />Finally, he tries to make the case that his experience was unusual because 1) it was perhaps a very rare bacteria that caused his coma, 2) the infection was caused almost spontaneously - no explanation as to what caused the infection, 3) he came out of the coma after a very lengthy period of time infected by such a rare and highly infectious agent, and 4) he apparently suffered no long-term ill effects as a result of his experience.<br />And, \\"Core\\", is a word used frequently, but when one looks for a definition, the pages first attributed to it in the book's index, pp 45-49, offer no mention of it.<br />So, a good book. but not a great book. Certainly worth checking out from the library, but not purchasing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I typically do not like British films; however, this is an exception.  My daughter recommended this show, so I've ordered the instant videos of Season 1 and 2 to get caught up on the show before I start watching the current shows on TV.  Well worth the price in my opinion.  I don't like most of the shows on TV today so I'm excited to find one to look forward to each week!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book breaks the barriers and speaks not only to serious runners but to those who never laced up a pair of runners shoes. Solid entertainment!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoyable game that offers several choices of puzzle layouts.  Some of the pictures on the cubes are different than another version I play on my computer, so that gets kind of confusing.  Overall I do like having it available on my Kindle for a change of pace.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great writing and acting.  Sort of a less cheesy English Little House on the Prairie.  Nice to be able to watch in between Downtown Abbey.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I was so thankful to be able to find this movie and buy it for my family! I grew up watching this movie, and it was always a favorite! It is based on a real hero from World War I - Alvin York who was decorated with the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was a simple &#34;common&#34; man of principle who was thrust into history and who handled both his moment of courage and the resulting fame with honor and exemplary character.  His part is very convincingly played by Gary Cooper. This was made in the day when movie heroes were really heroes, and I would highly recommend it to anyone! My children love it!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have loved every other DeMille book I've read. They all move very slowly, with great attention to detail, but this one is boring. I couldn't even finish it.

B005LAIHZE|5.0|ABRAHAM LINCOLN<br />VAMPIRE HUNTER<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln, what can be said about this man that hasn't already been said before? Wait I know, he has battled Vampires and Zombies for most of his life, its fact. I guess you dear reader had no idea about that did you? No you didn't, because it is one of the many government cover ups that are out there. Why did they never tell you about this? Well almost all of you would most certainly panic. Alas, now you know, but for today we will only discuss his many vampire escapades.<br /><br />You see when Abe was but a boy he witnessed his mother killed by a man who his father had worked for. History, or is that secret history has gone on to document that a young Abe would years later attempt to kill the very man who murdered his mother. As it turns out this man was indeed a creature of the night, a vampire. Naturally Abe had no chance against such a beast and was on his way to certain death. But as luck would have it a man named Henry Sturges was on hand to aid young Abe. They were not able to kill the vamp but they did come to an agreement. Henry would train Abe to hunt and kill vampires if Abe did exactly what he would say.<br /><br />So time would go on, how much time we are not sure but enough went by to make Abe a vampire killing machine. He hunted them down one at a time looking to finally one day find you know who. I am sure you all know about his wife and how they met, his years working towards politics and of course becoming the President. Well during that time he went in and out of vampire slaying including at terrifying night spent on a train. Now I could go on and on with this historically accurate report, or I could say watch this Biopic.<br /><br />Based on Honest Abe's honest biography by Seth Grahame-Smith who also wrote the script this Tim Burton produced flick is very fun. The look of the film and over all B movie feel only adds to the appeal of the flick. Director Timur Bekmambetov really knows how to shoot action as I am sure anyone who has seen his other films knows. It is these scenes that really drive the movie and push the pace. In fact it makes it feel like the movie could have been longer or at least moved slower at times. Also the final battle between Abe and lead vamp could have been a bit longer for entertainment value, but I am sure this version was the accurate account. Regardless I did like this movie and found it to be very entertaining and historically accurate.<br /><br />Still I have to say the movie was fun and the performances were just as good. Also I must admit that I really liked the end of the film and I really mean the end as in last scene. It involves Henry and well you will see what I am talking about. I was always a sucker for those types of scenes, once again after viewing you will see what I mean. The Blu-Ray is excellent coming with all kinds of special features. My favorite being the making of which goes into great detail about everything involving the film. Then of course the commentary by the writer is very interesting. There is much more that only make this release a must have for film buffs who enjoy the behind the scenes stuff. Stay tuned kiddies as next time we will be discussing Honest Abe's run ins with zombies, still historic fact, honest.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I would recommend this calculator to anyone.  Does It does what it needs to do! I wish it didn't have ads but that's what I get for free.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not p put this book down! The story was simply riveting and Katniss was the perfect unwilling heroine.  I could relate to her awkwardness, fear, disgust, hatred and sorrow.  Her confusion over Peeta is understandable too, but my heart breaks for him because his love is real. I can't wait to start the next book!
B002M9WW30|4.0|I enjoy all of these movies to some extent. The first two are absolute classics. The 3rd and 4th are silly fun. The 5th ain't great, but it's still watchable. The 6th has a very stupid idea behind it, but is still well-made and fun.<br /><br />I wish there were commentaries on each of the films, instead of only the last one. Other than that, excellent collection, particularly for $20.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Nice to get this movie, Despicable me, at a lower price than department stores.  Especially with the digital copy!  That is such a great offer.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|My kids completely loved this movie.  They want to watch it over and over all day lol.... Worth the price!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and knew I would want to view it again, so i bought it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was very interesting, and kept my attention. I enjoyed reading it. It was an interesting story that was sad yet uplifting.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of my favorite tv series. A great cast, perfect writing and an incredible story. Bought this for my in-laws for Christmas as they are huge fans of Nathan Fillion's Castle series. Trying to convert them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it the coolest game I have on my kindle. it is easy to play. I like it better then the first inn.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was awesome!!! Travis and Abby are complete opposites...he's the misunderstood bad boy with a reputation for loving and leaving girls in a split second and Abby is the virginal freshman who knows what she does and doesn't want and Travis isn't it. They spark a true honest friendship through a bet that Travis initiated and the friendships lines very quickly become unclear. He is everything she wants and didn't know it and she is everything he has ever wanted because she challenges him and isn't easily susceptible to his charms. This book kept me on my toes and I couldn't put it down and I can not wait for the sequel in a sense entitled Walking Disaster because I will finally get to see the story of Abby and Travis through his eyes. Great read for sure!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|hooks you from the beginning, very sweet and interesting characters, with unexpected twists.  Colleen Hoover is on a roll, cant wait for more
B0011Z1SMW|2.0|THE 2CD &#34;EXTRA TRACKS&#34; EDITION OF MAGNIFICATION HAS THE TRACKS &#34;GATES OF DELERIUM&#34; AND &#34;LONG DISTANCE RUNAROUND&#34; BUT ALSO HAS &#34;CLOSE TO THE EDGE&#34; . THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING THIS AS AMAZON DID NOT LIST THE TRACKS ON THE SECOND CD. THE ONLY THINGS LIMITED ABOUT THIS EDITION ARE THE WORDS &#34;PROMOTION ONLY - NOT FOR SALE&#34; ON THE CD.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|We bought this movie to complete our Harry Potter collection. Great movie at a decent price so we're happy with our purchase.
B00000JXVK|5.0|I saw this when it came out, wonderful to look at the state of the art long ago, How did they do it
B001UV4XIS|5.0|We bought this movie to complete our Harry Potter collection. Great movie at a decent price so we're happy with our purchase.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love the twilight saga, but, the last one is probably my absolute favorite!!! Love love love love love Twilight!!!!
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I have always been a fan of Mahjong games but this one is really different than the usual ones.  The HD graphics are unbelievable and being able to turn the tiles around from every angle is really cool!  Having the game come at you in 3-D adds to the fun too!  Great game and I would recommend it to everyone at any age!
B007HACDLK|3.0|THERE WERE TOO MANY CHARACTERS  WITH SIMILAR NAMES, SO IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO KEEP EVERYONE IN THE PROPER POSITION,  I HAD TO FLIP BACK TO BE REMINDED OF THE CHARACTER THAT I WAS PRESENTLY READING ABOUT.  IT WAS TOO CONFUSING!
B009ZQTD7Q|3.0|I loved William Hurt as Mr. Rochester... and Anna Paquin wasn't too bad either (largely because these two were great together on screen). However, I don't like that this adaptation changed so many things in the plot... I mean, I get it. The book is kind of long (for screenplay adaptation purposes) with \\"three\\" different phases. But at least KIND OF use the correct plot. The beginning difference didn't bother me as much as what they did to the ending... St. John is barely even mentioned and it's a completely different situation.<br /><br />Someone just needs to make a version of Jane Eyre that actually gives the movie enough screen time.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|This app is really useful when it works but it seems like I have to reinstall it once a month because it stops working. This is the only app I have that kind if trouble with. Also why don't they maker it avalible in the play store.
B000OONQ9O|1.0|If they wanted to release this movie with the additional footage as wanted to be seen by Walter Hill, they should have put this version and the original 'released to the theater' version in the same case. This way for those of us who wanted one or the other....you at least get the version you want and can just nix the other.  This was a bad move and I for one would love to have this movie on Blu ray but will NOT buy this garbage of a version for just THIS version for this price!  Thanks to all for the warning of the bad extra footage that was added to a classic movie.  I almost bought this D.V.D. and started to read the comments.  Will wait for the regular theatrical version, thank you! Please, release THAT ONE on Blu ray!
B0094K1PW4|3.0|action packed fun and a look into life most simple problems ( love) friends, imagination,respect,and keeping your word thanks you
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I got this app for my little sister to play, since she's a bit of a horse fan. She loved the game at first, but she got bored with it pretty quickly. But overall, it seems like a pretty good game for young horse lovers.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books of this series very much but am trouble following the characters and plot in this one.  Too much detail reviewing old material.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and to find it on Blue Ray is fabulous! The quality of the picture is great.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|This case is stylish and looks good and I think it would protect my Kindle if I dropped it, but when I'm reading a book it really isn't  all that comfortable to hold.  It needs a place to slide you hand through like some of the others I looked at...
B0063IH60K|4.0|A fun way to divert your attention from the TV without overtaxing the old brain! Fun and relaxing game! I play daily!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was a horrible book! Full of filthy words, ideas, etc.  I didn't finish it once I realized how disgusting it was. A huge waste of money.  This book should only be sold at XXX adult stores.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A mystery and a love story that keeps you wanting to know more. I was continually surprised. The story kept me guessing.
B001AITGWE|5.0|This movie is great. Michael Douglas has his best performance in this movie. Sometimes we are just having a bad day and we wish we could fight back. Well D-FENS does it for us. Aside from Bill Foster's psychological melt down the movie has many deep issues and is a great piece for any sociological study. 2 thumbs up!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was well written with a number of twists and turns.  It was also somewhat disturbing.  It certainly held my attention!
B008578PRK|4.0|I have seen this movie yet.  Hope to view it soon I don;t remember seeing it in my choices.  I would like a synoposis of this.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed it until the war was over when the story of this book was over.  It went on too long after that to set you up to read the next one.  If you have no intentions of reading the series,  stop reading right after the war.
B008EQIA7W|4.0|I love the Greek Mythology,  The frist movie the &#34;Clash of The titans&#34;  was very good and this was just as good keeping the tradition of the segall.
0345803485|3.0|I got halfway through this series and had to quit reading for one reason:  they have sex like every 5 pages.<br /><br />Now it is a very erotic novel, and I enjoyed the first few sex scenes very much, but when they have sex all the time, it just becomes unbelievable and a bit boring.<br /><br />I also came to realize that the main character has no personality.  I've heard the Twilight series described this way, and it made me think of Shades of Gray:  the main character is so generic, with very few specific traits so that nearly any reader could put themselves in her position and imagine themselves living her life.  Also, she is obsessed with him, and to me that makes the story even more boring.<br /><br />So pretty much, I would describe this as porn-it might get you hot and bothered, but it's not real-it's only meant for you to imagine yourself in her position.
B007SNMVH2|4.0|I love all of the &#34;Underworld &#34;  movies.  this was just as good I don't think you offer it in 3D stremming.  I have one of this series in 3D  do you offer this product in Three dimension?
B005CKPQNE|5.0|love it! it is the best show that there is on tv.  Everyone should watch it!  the characters are amazing!
B008MM9630|4.0|Very fun game. I was looking for a farm game and so far I am really enjoying this one. I have been completing quests and earning coins and gems.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Game runs out of lives too fast. Takes too long to acquire new lives. Closely resembles facebook games in its format.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and would recommend it any day, to anyone looking to watch MI style of movies.
1452110581|5.0|Almost every single poem in this little book had me laughing out loud. I read it twice before finally wrapping it since I bought it as a gift for my little sister. She's eleven, and she also loved it. It's a book that cat-lovers -- children and adults alike -- will thoroughly enjoy!
055380684X|5.0|This book is good reading for people who like short books. Content is good. Good book for goal oriented people...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun. The original was good but the upgraded version Is better. I think this is a great product.
0307346617|4.0|I definitely liked how this book contained every imaginable aspect within the various countries of the world and I found the bias of some countries to be extremely accurate, but there were some situation based flaws within the book, particularly the assumption that Russia would go from being very anti-religious to the most religious seemed very unlikely and Israel suddenly accepting Palestine with open arms to get behind the giant wall: not even close, but all-in-all I thought the layout behind the book was fairly intriguing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You have to read this. It keeps you interested the whole time.wanting to know what happens next. I would recommend this for anyone. Loveeeeeeeeeeed it!
B005NKGEP2|5.0|The is the first book I have read by this author.  I will certainly look forward to reading more by this author.  The story held my interest from the first page until the end.  The situations continued to surprise me as did the well developed and interesting characters.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I really liked it and it taught me that no matter how mean your sibling might be. You always love them.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Like most of the paid series they seem to mimic successful network series with the added features of better writers, theater actors and no commercials. I like Bacon in general so I watched the first in the series. My wife does not like violence so I will be watching it alone.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Bloon tower defense 5 is the best. I have always loved bloon tower defense games. New update, on computer buy BTD5 deluxe, New towers, and its only $15 dollars. I bought it.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|Got this for such a great price on Amazon. Plus I was having a difficult time finding it in any stores. This is an 80s classic, sort of scared me 25 years ago when it came out and it is interesting to see all these years later. This is an 80s classic for sure.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is in top form here and a master of the genre  ,,,, a perfect balance between the thin froth of Patterson and the plodding of Turow
B001GMQALY|1.0|I could not see this movie, it was never downloaded to my computer, it was a hoax, they should return the money
B00B10ENBA|5.0|The quality of the streamed video was great. I enjoyed watching the movie very much and enjoyed the extras that were played at the end of the movie. I've enjoyed all of  Ben Affleck's movies , &#34;Gone Baby Gone&#34;, &#34;The Town&#34; and now &#34;Argo&#34;
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun games and puzzles.  this space intentionally left blank.  this space intentionally left blank.  this space intentionally left blank.  this space intentionally left blank.
B001O4XWJM|4.0|A little slow but I liked that it was close to the book!  I really enjoy these types of heros.  You don't see them in movies very often.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|Engaging game with nice graphics. This game is visually and musically soothing. The texture of the pieces is done well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|How could you not get the second book?! You can't find any closure with the way the first book ends.....
B004GYY714|5.0|I wanted an app that tuned in Internet Radio. This does it and has a large database of radio stations. Searching unearthed three or four gospel bluegrass stations I never found before. I used this application on my Roku and it works well there too.
B0052REUW0|5.0|This book is not light reading! I find myself looking up words and historical and literary references as I read. But the scope of the material covered is prodigious and the author definitely has thoroughly researched the material.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|A different version of the Mentalist only without the Red John saga. Great show.  I have been wTching all season.  I just missed one episode because I deleted it by mistake from my dvr.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is the third Stephen King book I've read, and I have avoided his early &#34;scary&#34; titles. I have read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and The Stand, and while I really enjoyed and recommend them, this has been my favorite one so far. My mom was reading it at the same time I was, and we both were intrigued and couldn't wait to find out what happened next. If you have enjoyed Stephen King in the past, or want a great story that is hard to put down, you won't be disappointed. It does have a historical element, and it was fascinating the way King wove a fictional story around factual details.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is a great show. What do you get when you have a character with Low Latent Inhibition Disorder, a companion character with adrenaline addiction issues and unwavering loyalty, and writers and directors that know how to make the best of both? This show! Yes, there are only three episodes per series (albeit very long episodes), and it will leave you wanting more, but in a &#34;that was delicious and even though I shouldn't eat another bite maybe just one more&#34; sort of way. Not to be missed!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The subject is best appreciated if you have had elderly parents to care for. The acting was memorable except for the young indian hotel proprietor who I thought overplayed the part.
B00846REIS|4.0|I wish I had read this before 50 shades because I wouldn't have been comparing the whole time. But overall it was a great read.
B008WOULPK|3.0|i enjoyed reading this book but i thought Grace was completely uncritical of the world of fashion. She didn't address anything of substance, just told stories about her shoots and who she knew when. i would have liked to see her have commentary with some teeth but i guess that's how she's been Anna's second for so long. She gets on to get along. But what i did find simultaneously interesting and confusing is her role in the creation of a fashion image/story. I really thought the ideas came more from the photographer, but according to Grace many of the creative ideas for shoots were hers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just like Temple Run but without all the tilting, which for me is more fun! I recommend this game to everyone out there.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Great app, just wish I could find people easier than using their user names. Also wish they would update so I can log out.
0316227706|5.0|You can't help but smile when you pick up this book.  Sure the images are available online, but why not support the artist and get the book.  Just incredible images.  You can look through this book one hundred times and every time is as enjoyable as the first.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Great Deal, Great movie. Love Will Ferrell, he so great in Elf. It makes me laugh everytime I watch it
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Very nice erotic scenes. But at times hard to deal with aggressive physical scenes. But I thought the author wrote a overall captivating story.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love to take care of my horse annabella but when I want to put her in a compaction. it tells me that I need to feed her something for sixty coins so I do that and it tells me again so its not the but game that I have sorry
B006L4MX0Y|4.0|As the Amazon editor rightly puts it, Battle Royale sets the stage for The Hunger Games. I have seen the Hunger Games before I have seen Battle Royale and the similarities are way too strong between the two movies I have to agree that the Hunger Games does feel like an American remake to Battle Royale.<br /><br />What makes Battle Royale interesting is the fact that violence is forced upon the teenagers, or rather teenagers are forced to use violence upon each other in order to survive. Most violence movies have adult characters. And those adult characters mostly have criminal intent and exercise their free-will to commit the crimes. Battle Royale creates a setting where teenagers are thrown into a situation where they are forced to kill one another in order to survive. I have to admit that teenage Japanese girls shooting at each other violently does create an unprecedented spectacle in the action-violent genre.<br /><br />I think Battle Royale makes a strong social commentary about the violent trends among youngsters today and how the tough competition pushes them towards eliminating each other violently.<br /><br />However, the movie is not without its flaws. I am specially disappointed by the colors in the movie. I picked up the Blu-ray expecting a great picture quality. The colors are flat, almost non-existent. There is almost no contrast. The poor color saturation takes away from the visual style of the movie. As for the plotline, I have never understood the reason for Battle Royale act. How is Battle Royale act supposed to help the country ? That is never explained in the movie. I am sure most fans know since they read the book. Another criticism would be the relations between characters are not established in the beginning. I think the book does a better job of developing the relations between different characters. But then again, this is something for the fans who read the book can confirm.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Let me see the local weather, maps and keep on the weather where my children live. Like the dimensions of it.
0786187131|3.0|I'm a huge Aubrey/Maturin fan and have read the entire series twice and listened to the books on tape three times. There are at least 3 different narrators available, but the one offered by Amazon is not good and saps the stories of life.  By FAR the best is Patrick Tull, who narrated the series but is only available on CD as far as I know.  He brings the characters to life and does a great job with the various accents (though attempts at sounding like a woman aren't very successful)- and this series is so excellent that you're cheating yourself if you don't listen to his version (available at many public libraries).  I enjoy the convenience of the audio format but wish Amazon would offer the best version.
B006HYH2G8|5.0|There is still controversy over this book ( usually from evangelical christians). If one has never read it, they should. I hate the age old argument from the religious who claim Darwin believes we all came from monkeys. I seriously doubt they have ever bothered to read this.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As I read the book, I found myself projecting into Dr Alexander's experience.  To be assured of the unity of life and the peace to be found in the afterlife , gave me a sense of serenity that I hope to maintain.  Thank you  Dr Alexander for sharing
B003WWZ1R0|4.0|I absolutely love this CD. Tracks # 2 and #13 are my favorites, though most of the other ones are also very good. Whats great about this CD is almost all the songs are great. There's one track that I do not like and one that's okay. I usually don't find a lot of CD\\"s where all or most all of the songs are good or super good like this CD. Buy this one. You can't go wrong.  Namaste
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The saga continues...Martin is a skilled writer and evokes thrilling and mysterious settings and characters...but I am having some trouble keeping all the characters  and crises sorted out. Are  some of the characters really dead or not dead?!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Criag leaves no stone unturned for action.<br /><br />The villian is easily described as bletherskite.<br /><br />Especially like the connection to Scotland.<br /><br />I recommend this film.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Just one word FUN. No problem running on my Kindle Fire. A little easy to play, but a nice app.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This is my favorite show! If you love Broadway and musicals, you should check it out! You won't be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. at first I thought it was going to be a repeat of the first book but it has a twist to it. Awesome.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|fun and addictive :) however you have to use both hands to play. Really nothing more to say just typing words @ this point.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before i read the book so i knew what to expect but the book has so many details the movie could not cover.  The book is much better and you can understand what katniss herself is thinking.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I purchased this CD after seeing the movie &#34;looking for Sugar Man&#34; and it was great to hear the whole album, however I was unprepared for how amateurish or primitive some of the sound effects sound now, some are downright squeaky, but the songs are of course classics and some melodies very lyrical.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow Wow. what a way to end the series. total turn on things. It really makes you think.I love it.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This is a wonderful documentary, fascinating and insightful. If you want to feel like you're in the same room with these incredible musicians, this is the movie for you!
B003U4UPTE|5.0|I gave this rating because I loved the show.  Great character development & story-lines.  I did not know what would happen next.<br />Only weak story-line was Hurley’s past (this may be in Season 3).  It’s a little over the top.  Other than that, I loved it.<br />I recommend this TV show to those who like mysteries, dramas, and science-fiction.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love the story, but I always love good endings.  Just when you think it will be a bad situation, he pulls you back in and there is hope.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I hope they make it to when everything like the Pc or close to it but it is the best app on here to me and I hope they have more updates soon
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Awesome game...love playing.  Hate that the game has reset on me three times...lost all my characters, trophies, and coins....very frustrating!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Every minute of this movie is a pure action, kind of naive - but I enjoyed its noire-like cyberpunk-ish style and FPS-like soundtrack.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|an excellent biopic of a hopeless alcoholic! The plot thrives with intensity and kept me glued to the screen. As always Denzel is outstanding!!
B0021L9MJG|5.0|Creepshow has been one of my favorite horror films since I first seen it on The Movie Channel back in 1984.  It's definitely a fun, well made film.  The movie does hold up 30 years later, although I'm afraid that the new generation of horror fans might find it a bit slow, & not scary.  These stories are from the mind of the great Stephen King, who also has a role in the 2nd Segment of the film.  \\"Creepshow\\" has some of the finest actors of it's time including Adrienne Barbeau, Fritz Weaver, Hal Holbrook, E.G. Marshall, Ted Danson, & Leslie Nielsen.  Look for a young Ed Harris in the 1st Segment!  Overall, I give this film 5 Stars & it still remains one of my all-time favorite horror films!<br /><br />Christopher Sorick<br />Omaha, Nebraska 2013
B001UGB1X8|1.0|We were unable to watch this on streaming.  It kept reloading.  Went onto Netflix to watch it. The movie name was  The Electric Mist.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I just finished watching the first season of Homeland and I'm hooked!  I definitely want to continue with more of this great show.  Can't wait until they release season 2.  The acting on this show is great, especially Claire Danes.  I normally don't got for political thrillers, but this show reels you in from the beginning.  Definitely check it out!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE DIFFERENT PATTERNS. IT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE CHALLENGING! WARNING...This game can be addictive fun ;-)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one of the best sci-fi novels I have read in a long time. The humorous self-deprecating first-person writing style is very well done and really made me sympathize with the main character. One of my favourite movies is &#34;Apollo 13&#34; and this is a bit like Apollo 13 on Mars.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Because I was writing fiction, a text only book, this book turned out to be perfect for me. The step by step process, which I followed to the letter, gave me a successfully formatted book for Kindle devices. Everything worked, nothing was confusing, and it made the process easy.<br /><br />I understand that others with more complicated material did not find this book as helpful as they hoped. But for my purposes, it was ideal!
1439153663|5.0|very good book.  I read it in a couple days, could not put it down.  Gave it to my mom when I was finished and she said the same.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazon prime is perfect for watching shows, this season is no exception theres lots of drama to keep you coming back for the next  episode!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I think this item is  very well put together and I find it very intertaining. I liked it very much.

0765325950|3.0|**SPOILERS**<br /><br />i just don't know.. fain? lanfear? really? that's IT? and the end????? when i got to the last 50 pages, i thought, okay, there are 50 pages left, he can wrap this up. then i got to 40 and thought, well, this might be a bit hasty. then i got to 30 and i started getting scared that i was going to be disappointed. at 20 i was sure. at 10, i knew. the book literally wraps up in less that 5 pages after the climax. the ending was sort of satisfying, because rand lives (i guess?) and some main characters were actually allowed to die, but what next? we see that rand walks away and has some sort of new power (or is he in the world of dreams like the heroes of the horn? but then, why would min still feel his presence through the bond?). the dark one's prison has been restored to (better?) than it's original condition, which took about a paragraph to describe. rand is now in moridin's body (with no explanation) and is going to become a Kwai Chang Caine-like wanderer? and his women may or may not follow him? what about all the kids! what about the possible futures! there are very few allusions as to what is going to happen and it STINKS.<br /><br />i liked the book, it was definitely a page turner and DEFINITELY entertaining. i just wish the end were burned to all hell and re-written. padan fain was an afterthought, which was REALLY disappointing. perrin's and mat's role in the last battle were pretty satisfying (after matt FINALLY gets control of the armies).. i liked perrin's battle with slayer and the fact that the wolves answered the call of the horn (though again, it seems forced.. after all this time he \\"let's go\\" AGAIN and just hits slayer in the head with his magic hammer). but having matt just pull a quick \\"i already got chicken pox once\\" and then vaguely taking the ruby dagger and stabbing at mist to kill fain.. that was horrible. and perrin snapping lanfear's neck.. it was satisfying, but there was no real emotional dig in it, no desperation.and moghedien just gets ANOTHER a'dam snapped around her neck all willy nilly?<br /><br />all in all we really could have used about 100 more pages of denouement, rather that a 5 page epilogue. i'm glad it's over though.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I think this item is  very well put together and I find it very intertaining. I liked it very much.
B005NFJB2A|5.0|If you're hoping for a full hour on just the Hubble, you'll be disappointed. But I knew what I was getting into as I had seen this on the IMAX already.<br /><br />Know what you're buying here:<br /><br />half of the film is about the discoveries that they've made through the use of the Hubble. Using wonderful computer enhancements you'll see things you've never seen before.<br /><br />The other half of the flick is about the astronauts themselves, their training and the space station.<br /><br />It's paced very well, and my kids all loved it. They range in age from 6-10. (their friends thought it was pretty awesome too)<br /><br />Take note, watching this on a small screen is a pretty major loss.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this because I have a loved one who has suffered from depression. As a family, we have been through so much. But life does have a silver lining. It may not be what we wanted, but in hind sight, the silver  lining can be found. I loved the story being told by the man himself, not his therapist or mother or someone else. The read was easy, yet grabbed at my heart. Now, I would like to see the movie, to see if it remains true to the book.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|Hello dad's and gentlemen... one thing that I've learned over the last few years is that a great way to learn to understand your wives and daughters is to take the time to enjoy a good Jane Austin flick.... and this is a great one.<br /><br />This blows the other Gwenneth Paltrow one out of the water. With J. Austin, you need to take the time to tell the tale.<br /><br />So, guys, take the time to watch, learn... and push aside the need for sex and explosions.<br /><br />This is a well told tale of the inner workings of meddling relationships and prejudices, and how we overcome them with honesty and sincerity.<br /><br />The acting is incredible and photography is dead on for the tone, not to mention that it's clean for gals of all ages if they're interested enough in the tale. (which even my 6-year-old was)<br /><br />Gentlemen, take a couple evenings and snuggle up with your lady or daughters and let the story immerse you in this world of deep relationships, love, frustration and joy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read many Nicholas Sparks books and seen the movies too.  This one was right up there with &#34;The Notebook&#34;!  It kept me enthralled and the characters were realistic and interesting.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is the best show ever. Going into Season 6 and Im still hook. Gonna be a sad day when this show ends.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I chose this rating because I didn't have any problems with the delivery. I am reading it now and am enjoying it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It was an amazing game until it wouldn't let me go into it. It would start loading and then go away. Don't waste your time.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Takes a lot of taps to get any kind of real coin drops on HTC 1.  Find another game that has better reactions.
B00136Q1I0|4.0|The album is a good blend of Bruce's best stuff.  I would recommend it to a friend if they were a fan at all.
0805047905|5.0|A favorite at our house for over two years.  Simple, beautiful illustration and a timeless classic to add to your child's library.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have heard of this book for a few years. There is another book that talks about relationships being a &#34;bank&#34; and we make love deposits and withdrawals -- how damaging the withdrawals are. This book melds that concept together informing us how to give the most effective deposits and stop the damaging withdrawals. It's a quick read too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 has big surprises coming your way. The characters become more likable as you get to know some of them deeper.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|The selection of music was great and the recording is really nice. Really beautiful Chopin recommended for anyone who would like to know Chopin.
B00846F1YW|4.0|As a free app (app of the day) It's pretty good. Too easy for me to pay 3 dollars, though with no hint button they can't make it too hard without frustrating nearly everyone. I do find that sometimes it tells me I'm wrong when I'm not and I just have to find the right part of the item to touch for it to accept it. I really would hate to play this game on a phone or if I had big fingers.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|The free version only has one picture... You have to purchase it to get more pics to draw on but it's worth it. Both my 2and 6 yr old love playing with it. Fun to watch them too!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple 2 is awesome! It's way better than temple run 1. If temple run wasn't a game I would explode! I LOVE TEMPLE RUN!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Finally made got through it. Good trilogy! Lots to keep up with. Not a quick read, but very well done.
B00AYLTXQC|5.0|Helen Hunt is her usual girl next door sweet, loveable, want to hug her self.  The part John Hawkes plays and how he projects it should be award winning.<br /><br />Ted
B0036BK6MW|5.0|We downloaded this for the airplane trip we recently took, not realizing that the star character was also playing in the Super Bowl the same day!  It was a great story, well acted, and a wonderful family picture.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|love this series cant get enough of it! cant wait to see what they do next! very talented people on this show
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This was a well-done story about a very sensitive but common issue - aging, a marriage gone dormant, and two people who struggled to communicate their feelings for each other.  I'm glad there are still people who don't just throw out the white flag and give up.  We need to all work a little harder on our marriages!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|On a kindle fire it quickly gets you to a search engine with many options as to the type of material you are looking for.  Probably weakest if your just looking for text information.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I &#34;tried&#34; not to get hooked, but I failed miserably! This is hands down one of the BEST television series ever! I have found myself so immersed in the characters and the storyline, as if this were a real family...I simply cannot wait for Season 4!!!!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I really enjoy Daniel Craig as James Bond.  Great script - lots of action - a movie to add to my collection for watching again and again
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I've seen this movie several times. This time, thanks to Amazon streaming movies, i was able to rent it and watch with my GF who had never seen it. as expected it did not dissapoint. She also found it to be one of her favorite movies of all times.<br />It speaks volumes to the value found in connecting with others around you. Its rare, but sometimes those random connections can forge friendships that will span time and the globe. They are truely something to draw strength from.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is tops on my list!!  I'll be watching it again this summer before the next season begins.  I hope it goes on for years to come.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book makes readers get sucked into the book it is very great. It got me so interested I wanted to be in there society.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|I found this movie to be just ok, it a definite improvement from the second one, I’m glad they slowed down the transformations so I could see the change which is one of the reasons you watch the movie. I find the story line to be on the level for kids and the dialog should follow and not have so much adult content in it. That’s why kids today have no respect for anything, it what they imitate from movies (how unfortunate).
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this game. Its fun and keeps you entertained for a long time. Also if you finish it (Highly Unlikely) you can uninstall it, install it again and start over (:
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought that it was awesome! Trying to guess what happens next , well, that's out of the question...... Too hard to predict. LOVED IT!
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I do not find this functionality being useful using on a smartphone, perhaps it works better with a tablet.  Was unable to print at times and difficult to edit.  This was one of the amazon free apps of the day and glad that I didn't pay $14 for this.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|Not worth the money, unless there are help links that actually work. Unresponsive icons and no help link on the screen
B003M6OW4Y|3.0|I liked Season 1 much better... those episodes seemed more cohesive to me. Season 2 is pretty eclectic and quite different from the &#34;feel&#34; of season 1. I will finish watching Season 2 (1/2 way through) in hopes of they somehow tie a bow on it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. The book starts out slow and then catches your imagination even if you didn't live through the JFK assassination. Then I could not stop reading this book. Recommended reading for those who love Stephen King books and time travel!!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Sherlock Season 1 was an excellent modern version of the Sherlock Holmes story. I was impressed with the way the director visually shows how Sherlock's mind puts together all of the clues at a crime scene. The performances are excellent.
B0016492BW|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for our son. He has an odd sense of humor so we got him this movie.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Great characters, and the twists and turns keep you on your toes.  Dexter has a sarcastic and dark sense of humor.
B001993Y3G|5.0|Was a Christmas present for my son, he loves Mel Brooks movies and is trying to collect them all. But I goofed on this one.
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter loves this game so much that it is on all the electronics in the house......Okay....Okay....I love it too, and we fight to see gets top score.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Very addicting game. I thought it would be a game where you would actually have to make educational guesses based on information collected to solve the crime. I was wrong. It is the kind of game in which you have to solve different puzzles like find items on the page, find the differences between two pics, put pieces of a puzzle together, etc.<br /><br />It has an interesting story line and the puzzles are challenging. It was definitely worth getting and not a disappointment, just not what I was expecting. I haven't been able to put the game down since downloading it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Not only does my son love this game I love it too!  It gives kids a chance to learn responsibility and be rewarded fot taking care of their horse! I would defantly suggest this app to parents for their child!
B0000TB01Y|3.0|It is good quality at times, but at other's it has poor quality. There are also times where you don't see the stage( I'm guessing since you aren't allowed to tape the musical).
B00AB12TEI|5.0|Interesting perspective on how to promote oneself and advance one's carreer. The business model approach to that matter might indeed be adequate and effective.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Only puzzle app I have found so far with regular jigsaw puzzle pieces. Great app. Hours of entertainment. Lots of free puzzles.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Filled with interesting takes on the processes surrounding startups and on how most approaches are fundamentally flawed because they lack managerial perspective.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|This set is breathtaking.  You have to hold it in your own hands to see how awesome it is.  Not only do you get all of the records, you get the special packaging with the albums.  Some of the albums include full size posters.  This is a must-have for any Beatles fan.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I think it is five stars for detail  and the way the pictures are I might be 12 and this is a comic book but this is better than watching the tv show in some points but I watch the tv show and never missed an episode it would be better with Daryl and merel  sincerely ,Brandon A Carter
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|I was hesitant to see this film but two people, (men, mind you) said \\"it was really good.\\" Well, not if you're a woman and not if you have any sensitivity to sexual violence towards women. The exploitation and defiling of women in this film is deeply disturbing. Yes, it is a black comedy ala Blue Velvet, but that does not excuse nor make the violence acceptable. American films think nothing of exposing women to full nudity, violation of boundaries, and rape (via intercourse or oral). Were the sexual violence done to men, this film would be canned. I am very sorry I saw this film. I think much less of the director and Tracy Letts who I liked as a playwright.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is very great! It helps me a lot it keeps me organized I love it it is cute and I have a secret and data from it
B0000039QA|5.0|Its a great CD. I like to listen to it while I drive. Two disc was an added bonus! Like near all the tracks.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Funny, mind-bending, intense, mysterious, scary, inspiring, sad.  Doctor Who can be all of those things, sometimes simultaneously, and that gives this revival of the classic BBC show the uniqueness and diversity it needs to constantly entertain, whether you watch one a week or one an hour. Matt Smith is brilliant, as is Karen Gillan, and look out for Arthur Darvill, whose character begins rather inconspicuously but truly comes into his own as the series progresses. If you're new to the series and are looking for a convenient place to start, I suggest this season. You can always go back and see Chris Eccleston and David Tennant's iterations of the Doctor at a later date. Matt Smith will seduce you. Believe it.
B0068FZ18C|3.0|I love this series of movies and wanted them on both Blu-ray and DVD.  I searched Amazon and found various options for Blu-ray but only a few that offered a DVD copy as well.  The other Blu-ray/DVD version specifically states that both copies are on one disc.  I hate movies that use both sides of one disc, so I opted for the Universal 100th Anniversary Editions since they appeared to have the movie versions on seperate discs.  The cardboard sleeve/cover that comes slid over the Blu-ray box does not say anything about how many discs these contain, so it wasn't until I had removed the plastic and opened the case that I realized - the 100th Anniversary Editions are also on one disc.  I guess I have to be ok with it in a case like this where there does not really seem to be an option (at least not that I could find) for seperate discs for each version of the movies.  I wish it would have been stated better in the description or on the outside packaging of the discs.<br /><br />Great movies, though, as I stated earlier.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|In the original edition a voiceover at the beginning, added at the behest of the studio, explains 2/3 of what was intended to be a mystery for most of the film. It always bothered me, being one of the few discernible flaws in an otherwise masterful &#34;neo-noir&#34; exercise for the cerebellum. Luckily, the Director's Cut axes this unfortunate component. If you are new to Dark City, BUY THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.  Besides the aforementioned exclusion, there are also other noteworthy inclusions to the story. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go into detail, but the new scenes add depth and extra angles to an already engrossing character-driven story. Last but not least, the three commentary tracks are entertaining, particularly Roger Ebert's track.  All in all, a great value for one hell of an underrated masterpiece.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I enjoyed the the first 30min, but it got tedious.  It's kind of a downer watching someone just struggle with alcoholism.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|I saw Once on Broadway so wanted to see the movie.  They are somewhat different, as would be expected, but I loved them both.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game I loved It it was awesome it truly is good but there was a skipping problem with me so I hope it gets fixed.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Just a very fun and quirky movie to watch.  Found myself laughing a ton.  Edward Norton's character stole the show.
B0039OC64M|5.0|George Orwell's &#34;1984&#34;!!!!!  nuff said!!  It's a must read, over and over, over the span of your life.  or, a must view!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have always been inspired by Man's Search for Meaning, with its tough-minded and inspiring message. I got it for the Kindle to re-read.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Skyfall is the best Bond EVER! You have 2 choices - keep reading all the great reviews or . . . WATCH IT NOW! No point in pontificating about throwbacks or new stuff - - - - STOP WASTING TIME AND START ENJOYING THE BLASTED FILM - YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! That's my review and I'm sticking to it!
B004KKXMSI|5.0|It wasn't until the triligy got to me at home when I noticed all the &#34;foriegn&#34; stickers all over the box. It's an import. Holy #$@^ Batman! I was scared so I put it in my megachanger and It played. IT PLAYED! This is region coded for the U.S. after all!<br /><br />On another note the picture quality is a big step up from the standard def dvd's. However each movies' picture is noticabley sharper than the last. Naturally. The jury is still out on the audio for me. I've only watched the first 2 movies, so far, and the audio is good but I haven't watched those 2 movies on dvd in a very long time (as in pre Blu-Ray era) so a cmparison is kinda pointless. Part 3 is the one I watch the most. The part where T'-Rex was feeding is refference level stuff on any audio system including my 7.2 system. Just thought i'de throw that in. Anyway part 3 will tell me everything I need to know about wether or not the audio has been stepped up a notch or not.<br /><br />With that said this is a great buy and it will play in your Blu-Ray player.
140131046X|4.0|I have a collection of Mitch Alborn books and this one again teaches a lesson.  Easy read.  Book was in excellent condition.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Wonderful book! A real page turner, I couldn't wait to see how it was going to end and how the characters were entwined.A must read ..<br /><br />.
B00846F1YW|2.0|I am stuck. An object I need to find is behind the tool tray across the top of the screen. Wish I could play further.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I looked at this game thinking it would suck. Put it happens to awesome. So get it,it's free. Build up you're island, and make friends.  Add me if you'd like  Homerandmythology :D
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and will be reading more of Dawkin's writings. I'll probably re-read this book though and search the links in the book as well.
B003FC3LQK|5.0|Dirty Dancing is my absolute favorite movie of all time!! Every time I watch it I always get so excited!! Especially when he says \\"nobody puts baby in a corner.\\" Eeek!! Love love love it!!!!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I began reading this for two reasons, my son is doing portions of it for an English assignment & the movie came out. I have been pouring over it and was unable to put it down while my mind was reeling in and out of each brilliant character.<br />I recommend this novel for everyone.
B004U52VPS|4.0|The plastic blocks are pretty sturdy - it is easy to build the structures shown on the cards.  The slingshot is a little erratic, though.
0553801473|4.0|As a continuation of characters I've grown to love and a connection to what I am guessing may happen in future books, this held its ground. I adore this series--the world, the ruthlessness with which Martin orchestrates it, and the way he has sucked me fully and completely into anticipating future outcomes. I have theories, I want to talk to people about it. Not since Harry Potter have I been so invested.<br /><br />But this book doesn't stand alone. It is a piece of a whole, so as a book it falls down a little. The first three of the series were sublime, the 4th and 5th less so--he has sprawled the story a bit too thin. I just hope that in the last two he is able to pull back to the magic he created initially. I believe he will... middles are often unruly, but I suspect less patient people may be annoyed.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|If hostile aliens invaded Earth, this is what it would be like!  Or at least it might be like this.  Look, this film is no deep intellectual exercise.  It is a rip-roaring story with great special effects about the US Military defending Los Angeles against a ruthless alien invasion.  There is a solid story here, and I was pleased to discover that this film held my interest at all times -- something that many films these days fail to do.  The aliens looked plausible and real, and the troops acted pretty true-to-life--they were not caricatures as too many combat flicks sometimes portray.  This one is recommended.  RJB.
B0001I561E|1.0|Horrible DVD. Skipd and it is not the original. It is a copy. When it doesn't skip the words do not even match the lips!!!!!<br />Extremely unsatisfied!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's great to play when u have nothing to do<br />It's a must try, maybe you will like it to. :)
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I never pay for apps because I usually feel it is pointless, but I am a fan of the Rayman games so I decided to throw a few bucks at this app & I am glad I did! It is tons of fun & has great replay value! Looks great on my Kindle Fire HD! If you are considering buying this game... Do it! It's worth it!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Could have done with out all the leftist junk, but it was an interesting and different way to tell a story.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Of all the jewels type games I have played I like this one the most. Seemed easy at first but got challenging later on.  Great gameplay with a lot of power play options make this game really fun.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|my kids will sit and watch this movie all day if we don't turn it off. amazon.com has really taken care of us as far as getting things to us fixing any kind of small problems that were more our fault than anything. I stopped shopping at Walmart.com because amazon offers better prices and offers more selection on  bulk items like diapers and wipes. I buy everything from deodorant, to razor blades, to games, to movies, tools, beds, pillows, vacuums, deep fryers, cell phone accessories, I buy everything at Amazon.com. we love you Amazon.com
B00846F1YW|4.0|I'm addicted to search &amp; finds. Mysteryville 2 is not only fun to play but safe for my kids to help me with. This game not only gives you search &amp; finds but puzzles also. I enjoy playing it.
B008D30K7E|4.0|What an idea for a book! This 100 year old man starting another adventure on his birthday. I laughed out loud at times. The story is absurd but marvellous escapism. I love the way the author ties up everything so neatly. The humour may not be to everyone's taste  ( think along the lines of Tom Sharpe) I am giving the book 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt it dragged on a little too much towards the end. Worth a read!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I have enjoyed reading Seriously. Ellen is so funny. Enjoy watching her shows also. She is the best, and so generous.
B00A6L78TY|3.0|I can't decide if I love this album yet, but I have only listened to it a couple of times. I picked up on a big Bob Dylan influence in many of the songs, so that was kind of fun. lyrics seem good, and different, too if you can actually focus on them.
B005LAII12|5.0|It made me laugh out loud, I really enjoyed it, I love movies with Mark Wahlberg any ways, hes a great actor in my opinion, and with Seth Macfarlane doing the voice of Ted ,plus writing and directing it made the movie all the more apealing to me. I love Family guy, yes I know it can be a bit racy at times but thats why i loved this movie it pushs some boundries, I will watch again for sure.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I need a calc. 4 school + were doing a school project called byot - bring your own technology. I use this app when I forget my calc.
B00004XMV6|4.0|This movie sometimes borders on creepy but then snaps you right back to complete lust.<br /><br />Get it, it is a must have for any DVD/Movie buff.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. It was easy to navigate and if you got stuck you could always use the hint button. Great Job!!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|If you're not a SOA fan,  you're missing out as this is one of the best series on Television right now. The only bummer is that we have to wait until September for the next season to come out!
B00B04NJI0|5.0|The ABC's of Death was easily my most anticipated movie of 2013, and I'm pleased to say that it was definitely a winner.<br /><br />If you're a true horror fan, than you WILL appreciate this movie! With 26 different short films (by 26 different directors with a $5000 budget each) there's something for everyone in here! It's everything you could want in a horror anthology and more.<br /><br />The good films outweigh the bad, but don't get me wrong there is a handful of crappy short films in here (F is for Fart, G is for Gravity, M is for Miscarriage, Z is for Zetsumetsu..) but looking past those are some real gems (D is for Dogfight, R is for Removed, T is for Toilet, X is for XXL..) Beware some of these films are a little hardcore (L is for Libido..) and not for the weak-hearted, but that's what makes this a great horror movie!<br /><br />I will be adding this to my horror DVD collection, as soon as it is released!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I expected a movie more about  a plane crash, instead an excellent movie about the pilots issues.  Denzel Washington was superb as always
0307887960|5.0|Im 42 & had gained aprox 15 lbs over last 2 yrs from bad eating habbits.  Never tried any diet b4. Friend recommended this book. Read it front to back & cannot believe what it did for me.  It's been over 1 year, and the weight has stayed off.  Im back to eating/drinking as before, but the weight stays off.  You MUST read the book front to back to understand how & why this works. If you don't,  you really wont get it and you wont realize why you need to follow the diet as instructed. As long as you follow the diet all the way through to the 4th stage, you will be amazed.  It has changed the way I eat. Phase one (last 2-5 days, depending on your weight loss) was the hardest.  After that i was NEVER hungry, and the weight was melting off, no joke.  Although I can eat/drink the way I used to, this diet has changed the way I look @ food. My husband dropped 20 lbs, my neighbor over 40 lbs. They have all lost the weight & kept it off.  Nice part is .. if you do fall off the wagon (which i did, several times during the diet) it was easy to get right back on track. I have never felt better, I have never had more energy. I don't believe in any supplements, pills or \\"quick\\" weight loss scemes for weight loss.  This plan is amazing. You've GOT to read the book thought, trust me!!!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Breaking Bad is right at the very top of the best t.v. shows of all time.  The characters are compelling and well drawn.  Whether you love them, hate them or waiver back and forth, just about every significant character in the series will draw you in and you will form an opinion i.e. none of them are forgettable.  Even the character actors who fill the lesser roles are extremely well written, and as my wife points out the casting is spot on.  The beauty of watching t.v. on demand (or on disk) is the ability to watch your fill in one sitting and my wife and I enjoyed doing so with this and every season of Breaking Bad.  FYI, the other 9 in order are: The Wire, The Sopranos, Mad Men and Arrested Development,

B0088WFZQG|5.0|It's like watching fiction.....but you know it's not.  It was difficult to watch knowing that it was based on truth. How amazing that we have people like that willing to defend our country to the death....
0800177363|5.0|Well produced. Wonderful true story. Made to be watched again and again. For ALL AGES. Family movie. See it. Feel the love

B002BJGYU8|5.0|this product came packaged well in good condition with evertything in tact.  the product itself is an enjoyable way to spend  a rainy afternoon
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I've read most of the bad reviews and let me just say this...YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY MORE TO PLAY THE SECOND LEVEL. Your child is on the wrong thing on the game there are 3 big worlds YOU get when you pay and then there is one WORLD you have to pay to get. Your child was just on the wrong part of the game. I love it and I can't wait until the next update
B002BJGYUS|3.0|this product came damaged. the holders were broken so the disc flopped around inside the case but the disc played fine and the st ory is another afternoon enjoyment
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I loved this one in the series of ICE AGE. They have managed to keep all of them funny and family fun. hope they do a couple more.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is so awesome! I watched it with my 10 year old son and he enjoyed it too. It's so nice to watch a film with a heroine who is brave and strong! Such a departure from other Disney films where the female characters wait for their prince to come and give them what they seek. In Brave, Merida makes her own destiny. Great movie for girls and boys! (Parents too!)
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Great movie. Well done, captivating, and touching. Seeing Rodriguez morph from the construction worker to the stage-owning South African superstar is truly unforgettable.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|This AMD 6 Core Processor works well on our server.  The processor provides low operating temps while processing our data.  Highly recommend this unit for its speed and quiet operation.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I always enjoy Follett books, particularly &#34;Pillars of the Earth.&#34;  I thought I was learning some good perspective and history of WWII until I read a comment about the Washington DC baseball team, the Nats.  Bad mistake!  The DC team back then was the Senators.  Such a glaring mistake made me wonder about other historical info.<br /><br />This second book is better than the first; hoping the third will be even better.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Kids adore this game one of the reasons I bought my tablet. Great graphics especially in HD. Played on Kindle Fire.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I enjoy Walking Dead from Season 1 and have been waiting patiently for this Season to come out and forgot about it till I received an e-mail from Amazon. Needless to say, I jumped right on it.<br /><br />This is a good series to anybody who enjoys a zombie or end of the world shows.
B0086HGW42|4.0|I only recently became familiar with Ed Sheeran.  I heard him perform on a Saturday morning news show and immediately liked his voice and his style.  And he has interesting lyrics.  I previewed his music on Amazon to make sure I would like more than the couple of songs I heard him perform and I liked every one.  Would reccommend his music to anyone.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Never had any issues with this app, and I use it daily. I love all the settings you can customize and it saves them.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|I enjoyed watching the movie. Good acting, crisp dialogue, and gripping<br />plot - what else do we need from a movie that supposed to entertain us? Argo<br />has it all.<br /><br />The film is based on actual events and tells the story of the 1980 joint<br />CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic<br />personnel out of revolutionary Iran. Tony Mendez, a CIA operative, sets up a<br />phony film studio that announces a film project looking to shoot in Iran.<br />Mendez pretends to be a film producer, he goes to Teheran and struggles to<br />rescue six American diplomats by posing them as production crew.<br /><br />While watching the movie, you feel that some scenes are pure fiction. For<br />example, it's unbelievable that the airport security guy trusts Mendez's<br />business card and calls his production company to find out if Mendez really<br />works there. It's a joke. When you suspect someone to be a spy, you do not<br />trust his business card, do you? How did the Iranian secret service know<br />that the American diplomats were hiding in the Canadian Ambassador's<br />residence? Why did they suspect it but never took measures to arrest the<br />Americans? At least at the airport? Isn't it too suspicious for the<br />immigration officers when they can't find immigration cards of 6 Canadians<br />who entered Iran two days ago? How come the immigration cards are missing?<br />If Iranian secret service knew that 6 American diplomats had escaped, why<br />didn't they inform their immigration department and airport security about<br />that? A friend of mine, who is a professional pilot, says that the scenes<br />of police cars chasing the Boeing 747 down the runway were nuts. It's<br />impossible for a police car to catch up a Boeing. One more unbelievable<br />thing is the 'instant update' on the reservation computer screen in the<br />Tehran airport. How could it happen in 1980?<br /><br />The answer is that there were no such things. It's pure fiction for<br />the sake of storytelling and entertainment.<br /><br />\\"In reality, the diplomats never appeared to be in imminent danger: the six<br />never went to a bazaar, Taylor's wife bought three sets of plane tickets from<br />three different airlines ahead of time, there was no confrontation with<br />security officials at the departure gate, and there was no runway chase at<br />the airport... Canadian Ambassador Taylor noted that, \\"In reality, Canada was<br />responsible for the six and the CIA was a junior partner. But I realize this is<br />a movie and you have to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.\\" Taylor is<br />also shown threatening to close the Canadian embassy in the movie; in reality,<br />this never happened.\\" (Wikipedia).<br /><br />There are other historical inaccuracies. Besides, the film suffers from poor<br />characterization, but it's a modern thriller. The authors have to follow the law of<br />genre to keep young audience glued to their seats. Though they should not have mixed<br />two or even three genres in a \\"serious movie\\" that turned out to be neither real<br />comedy nor serious drama. It's definitely a thriller since \\"a thriller thrills\\",<br />but not an intellectual one since plausibility is sacrificed for the sake of tension<br />and suspense.<br /><br />Generally, Argo is a good movie, or at least - entertaining. The story is cooked up,<br />but it is fun to watch. Does is deserve an Oscar? I do not think so. It's good,<br />but not great. Though it's much better than Life of Pi and Silver Linings Playbook.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|I thoroughly enojy this app and is a GREAT way to pass the time. I love how it's a challenge to create the items.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've never seen it so clear until now. Plus I love all the hours of behind the scenes, deleted scenes, documentries etc.
B0095P29EG|3.0|Not the best choice for the ever expanding quality characters coming out of the Marvel stable. Good looking guy should make this movie palatable to females. But, from the male (comic book fan) perspective, the story was inconsistent and boring. The action was muddy somehow and when expected it never came. Very thin storyline and bad dialog doomed this movie. Watch it if nothing else is on. Natalie portman is always a joy.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love this series! So I had all the rest of them, and so course I had to get the next one.
B000I9X9HY|5.0|I enjoyed this film years ago, and had fun watching it again. Of course, now it's amusing to see Connery as the wise investigator and Harmon more or less bumbling around, way too eager and not focused enough. For fans of NCIS, this brings a chuckle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Hands down one of the best books I have ever read. Any age can enjoy this book. . Definitely worth the money I'll be reading again
B0023S50DO|4.0|I enjoy action and drama with excitement.  This I found very enjoyable... Consists of saving the world, but a good played out movie.. Several high actors are in this movie... I would recommend this movie if  you enjoy,action,drama and excitement. ! Some parts keep you on the edge of your seat!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I love this movie. It's the perfect balance of comedy, romance and some singing thrown in for good measure. My husband, who usually frowns when I want to watch a romantic comedy, found it entertaining, I actually watched it more than once in a row.
B005HSL626|5.0|Download Fruit Ninja game as my grandchildren were telling me to find some games and play.. I downloading this game and it's alot of hand and eye cordination, which I find fun. I have played this alone and also with my 5 year old grandaughter who beats me.. Great fun ..I would recommend this for all ages.. Just learn to be quit with the hand and eyes ...haha..<br /><br />Janet Hendrickson
B002ZG976U|5.0|It's not a movie with a story that really makes you stop and think.. it's a movie that you just enjoy overall. I love the music, story, dancing, and all the different crazy relationships!
B0035LGXXO|4.0|I loved this movie, when it came out in 1975 I went to watch this..IF  you enjoy violence,fighting and some romance this is for you.  I wouldn't recommended this anyone younger than 18 as it's about gangs in New York.. Not realisitic but,.. So many kids get the wrong idea's and believe they are invinceable.  But it is truly an amazing movie filled with action....Not all the gangs have evil intentions..just as this shows,,,but a gang on the run in New York  amist all other gangs....good movie..  I have watched this several times.. I like Michael Beck who is one of the stars and the story line is in NY..So you can relate.. I have told some of my friends , even my daughter about this movie and they all enjoyed it as I have... So if your in for some high action this is for you.<br /><br />Janet Hendrickson
B00899F0G8|4.0|I didn't think I would like this show at first, but I've really gotten into the story. I like how much they've done with the story and how it's not easily predictable. They don't figure out all the details right away about who's blackmailing them.
B005J4ASDG|4.0|I was looking for something to get me in the mood for The Hobbit and this was the it.<br />I made me watch L of R again.<br />The Hobbit was good too.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game.its so fun I could play it all day.but you shouldn't as you would get a headache.  But I love it.  :-)  (From my son)
B003H9MSPG|1.0|Nerf needed to improve this before they shipped it.<br />It has too many failures to describe.<br />My son gave up on all nerf products after this one.

B007THA4FI|1.0|The author never got to ah point.  I read about half of it and was so bored that I putti down, and really want to ask the author for a refund.
B0091THDOM|5.0|The product has been changed following my first review. I think the previous one has a defect. Now it's perfect. It looks classy and perfectly fit my iPhone 5.<br />I definitely advise you to buy it compared to those we can find at the Apple Store or wherever it is
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I originally felt like this book was Back to the Future meets The Twilight Zone, but was happily disappointed.  The pages flew by, and I found that King's books, like Stand and Under the Dome, both written early in his career (as this one was) to be his best.  King's work, when not bordering on the macabre, are worth the time spent reading them.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|When you look at the plot; a boy alone on a life-raft with a tiger, you would wonder where is there a story here. However the author provides a riveting tale at a brisk pace and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Well worth the read.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love it.It wakes me up on time.I reccemend it to every kindle fire owner to get a head start on the day!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|My grandkids taught me this game during Christmas and its a lot of fun.  We of course compete against each other for bragging rights.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is so good for all ages.It is worth the time and it it fun addictive and beautiful.You should get it.bye have fun!!!
B00422LESO|3.0|I read this because I am one of those people who likes to read the book before the movie so I can make my own interpretation of the characters. It was a fun, 'fluffy' read, but I was disappointed since it didn't provide the same deeper wisdom that I so enjoyed in her fairy-tale style books. But readers will be entertained by the narrator's wit and by the absurdity of the situations she finds herself in. I was disappointed that the main character fails to display or learn a very deep lesson about love. Whatever lesson she learns doesn't really match the depth of Jane Austen's love stories which is why they have withstood the test of time.
B0018BB20W|5.0|Do we really understand, at this late remove in time, how bold \\"Days of Future Passed\\" was for the era in which it was made?  What the Moody Blues did in crafting this album back in 1967 required some bold artistic risks, and the risks that the band took paid off handsomely, as this album maintains every bit of the vigor and freshness that it had at the time of its release.<br /><br />The helpful liner notes for this edition explain well the manner in which the Moody Blues metamorphosed from the northern-English blues-rockers who recorded \\"Go Now\\" to the progressive rock band that made \\"Days of Future Passed.\\"  That metamorphosis involved a couple of personnel changes; guitarist Denny Laine and bassist Clint Warwick left the band, to be replaced by guitarist-vocalist Justin Hayward and bassist-vocalist John Lodge respectively.  (Don't feel bad for Denny Laine, though; he later worked with Paul McCartney, and enjoyed plenty of success as a core member of the band Wings.)<br /><br />Aside from personnel changes, the other great change that the Moody Blues underwent between \\"Go Now\\" and \\"Days of Future Passed\\" was a change in sensibility.  The liner notes quote Hayward as saying, \\"We had been playing music that wasn't suited to our characters.  We were lower middle-class English boys singing about life in the Deep South of the U.S.A. and it just wasn't honest.  As soon as we began to express our own feelings and to create our own music, our fortunes changed.\\"  Also explained in the liner notes is the manner in which what the band's label wanted to be a rock redaction of Anton&iacute;n Dvor&aacute;k's \\"New World Symphony\\" evolved instead, fortunately, into something else entirely.  Some hint of what such an album might have sounded like can be found in Emerson, Lake & Palmer's 1971 album \\"Pictures from an Exhibition,\\" in which ELP did a fine job applying rock instrumentation and techniques to Modest Mussorgsky's 1874 orchestral suite of the same name.  But I'm glad theMoody Blues stuck to their artistic guns and recorded \\"Days of Future Passed\\" as they did.<br /><br />\\"Days of Future Passed\\" is a concept album; but like the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" released in the same year, it is a concept album with a relatively loose concept.  As \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" took for its concept a very simple idea -- that of a talented and versatile music-hall band playing a live concert for an appreciative audience -- so \\"Days of Future Passed\\" seeks to capture the cycles of human life through focusing on the course of a single day.  This is worlds away from the kind of \\"rock opera\\" cantata or song cycle that would come to be characteristic of later concept albums -- from The Who's \\"Tommy\\" (1969) and \\"Quadrophenia\\" (1973) through Genesis's \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" (1974), Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" (1979) and, many years later, Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" (2004) and \\"21st Century Breakdown\\" (2009) -- but it works well.<br /><br />The London Festival Orchestra (house orchestra for Decca Records) starts the album off with \\"The Day Begins,\\" an instrumental piece that includes leitmotifs from various songs that the listener will later hear, including \\"Dawn Is a Feeling,\\" \\"Another Morning,\\" and \\"Nights in White Satin.\\"  \\"The Day Begins\\" also features the first of drummer Graeme Edge's spoken-word poems that would become a famous, or notorious, feature on the albums of the Moody Blues' classic period.  It's not particularly distinguished as a poem -- \\"Brave Helios, wake up your steeds/Bring the warmth the countryside needs\\" -- but it was a bold expedient for its time, and Edge's spoken-word poetry would grow in complexity and nuance over time.<br /><br />A hopeful-sounding orchestral interlude segues into the album's first actual song, \\"Dawn Is a Feeling.\\"  This song, composed by keyboardist-vocalist Mike Pinder, is sung in alternating movements by Hayward and Pinder.  The parts sung by Hayward have that sense of romantic melancholythat has so often characterized his work with the band; the parts sung by Pinder center around a series of descending piano chords that look ahead to much of Pinder's work from the Moodies' classic period.  Another orchestral bridge then leades into flautist-vocalist Ray Thomas's \\"The Morning: Another Morning.\\"  This cheerful tune, centered around an upbeat flute melody, has more of a pop than a rock feel to it (except for the song's dynamic middle 8), but with its lyrical references to how \\"Time seems to stand quite still/In a child's world, it always will,\\" it serves its purpose of advancing the album through the next part of its archetypal day.<br /><br />An orchestral bridge with musical elements from \\"Another Morning\\" then leads into bassist-vocalist John Lodge's \\"Peak Hour.\\"  The song's title means to many Britons what \\"rush hour\\" means to Americans, and the energetic feel of the song matches well with its subject matter.  Of all the Moody Blues, Lodge seems like the one who always most enjoyed rocking out; and this song has a fine, down-to-earth quality to it.  Lodge's voice has an urgency that lends itself well to rock-and-roll, and \\"Peak Hour\\" shows all the band members mixing it up well.  Pinder's Mellotron provides supporting texture, Hayward's guitar and Lodge's bass move the song forward with appropriate intensity, and Edge's drumming really shines here.  \\"Peak Hour\\" slows down for a bit, but then speeds up in a pulsing manner, right through to the song's big finish that originally marked the end of Side 1 of the album.<br /><br />Side 2 begins with a two-part song suite titled \\"The Afternoon.\\"  The first part of the suite, a Hayward composition, has the formal title of \\"Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)\\", but no one really calls it that.  \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" it has been since the album's release, and \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" it remains today, a Moody Blues classic.  A catchy Mellotron melody by Pinder leads into Hayward's rich, emotional vocals, with Lodge's energetic, mobile high-register bass providing strong support.  A long-held note by Hayward leads the song into a rollicking barrel-house piano interlude by Pinder, as the song changes pace; and a flute solo by Thomas makes a nice contribution as well.  Another orchestral interlude then leads into Lodge's \\"(Evening) Time to Get Away,\\" a slow, melancholy-based piece centered around low-register piano, with Mellotron and acoustic guitar in support.  I'm not crazy about the falsetto vocals in the middle, but this song contributes well to the album.<br /><br />What follows next is another two-part song suite, titled \\"Evening.\\"  This suite begins with Pinder's \\"The Sun Set,\\" a song that sounds very Eastern and mystical from the moment one hears the finger cymbals at the beginning.  Here, one gets an initial hint of the mysticism that would characterize much of Pinder's work with the band: \\"Take a look out there/Planets everywhere.\\"  But Thomas's flute and Pinder's Mellotron work well together, and the mysticism of the song does not seem as forced as it sometimes would on Pinder's later work with the band.  The second part of the suite is Thomas's \\"Twilight Time,\\" a direct, piano-based rocker in which Thomas's low, restrained vocal is well-supported by fine harmonies.  It's a very fine song.  I only wish Thomas had written more songs like this, and fewer self-consciously whimsical tunes about hobbits tripping through the meadow and whatnot.<br /><br />And then comes Hayward's \\"The Night: Nights in White Satin.\\"  A classic.  Hayward's deft guitar and rich, emotional vocal works well with Lodge's contrapuntal bass and Pinder's Mellotron.  A moving flute solo by Thomas adds to the brilliance of this unforgettable love song.  I saw the Moody Blues play live once, at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland, and after the band played this song, the applause went on for at least ten minutes.  Hayward looked down at the stage floor, and seemed somewhat embarrassed by all the fuss.  Another spoken-word poem by Edge brings the album to its official close -- again, his poetry is not as deft here as it would be on later albums, but it recalls well the album's larger themes, with its references to the moon as a \\"Cold-hearted orb that rules the night/Removes the colors from our sight.\\"  A big finish, with a gong, brings the album to a close.<br /><br />This CD release is a particular treat because it includes several extra songs, in which one gets a sense of the band groping for an identity.  A cover of the Animals' 1965 song \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\\" originally played on the BBC's \\"Saturday Club\\" program, features Hayward on vocal, with Thomas's flute playing the riff for which the Animals used guitar.  It's an interesting experiment, but the Moodies' ethereal harmonies don't really match well with this song.  Hayward's \\"Fly Me High\\" is an uptempo rocker with high harmonies that complement well Hayward's vocal and acoustic guitar and Pinder's low-register piano.  Pinder's \\"I Really Haven't Got the Time\\" is an energetic rocker with barrelhouse piano and doo-wop harmonies in the background.  It has a bluesy piano solo and first-rate harmonies.  Quite frankly, I wish Pinder had spent less time leading us to the mystical mountaintop of enlightenment, and more time rocking out, as he does on this song.  \\"Love and Beauty,\\" another Pinder composition, features low-register piano with Mellotron in support, nice harmonies, and some excellent bass-guitar work from Lodge.  It's characteristic '60's Britpop, but well done.  Hayward's \\"Leave This Man Alone,\\" an energetic guitar-driven power-pop song, almost sounds Who-esque, and the way in which Hayward's electric guitar and Lodge's bass work together does make me think of Pete Townshend and John Entwistle from the time of, say, \\"Call Me Lightning.\\"  And Hayward's \\"Cities,\\" an interesting, pensive, vaguely menacing piano-based piece, served well as the original B-side for the 45-rpm singleversion of \\"Nights in White Satin\\"; but urban social criticism?  From the Moody Blues?  Again, these bonus songs give the listener a sense of a band in search of -- not the lost chord, but the identity they eventually found.<br /><br />Alternate versions of \\"Tuesday Afternoon,\\" \\"Dawn Is a Feeling,\\" \\"The Sun Set,\\" and \\"Twilight Time\\" show how fine these songs are, but also indicate how much the songs gained a sense of unity by being linked via orchestral interludes.  Again, I'm not sure if the Moody Blues fully realized what a sea change they were bringing to popular music when they released \\"Days of Future Passed.\\"  This album was a masterpiece in its time, and it is a masterpiece now.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|The plot thickens in this second installment of Oliver's trilogy. It introduces new characters, new complications, and new ideas to challenge the reader. In a similar vein as the Hunger Games, the question of how far you can go when your cause is just is dealt with. Looking forward to seeing how the author gets out of the predicament left at the end of the book.
B009FBX5M0|2.0|I love Thomas Newman's soundtracks.  His LEMONY SNICKET'S<br />A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS soars with mischief and<br />melancholy.  His ROAD TO PERDITION captures and accents<br />dark doings in a young boy's life.  (The Paul<br />Newman-Tom Hanks piano duet is particularly exquisite.)  The mischievous<br />themes for THE PLAYER accentuate that film's<br />playful irony.  And AMERICAN BEAUTY lingers in the mind.<br /><br />Now Mr. Newman - at director Sam Mendes' invitation - has<br />provided the score for the newest 007 blockbuster,<br />SKYFALL.  I do wish I could say this time that he won me<br />over (as John Barry always did, even in the sloppiest Bonds).<br />Alas! he did not.<br /><br />There are certain cuts that do capture 007.<br />\\"Jellyfish\\" - Bond's infiltration into a neon-lit<br />Shanghai skyscraper in quest of an assassin -<br />unsettles with its percussion and weird piano notes.<br />\\"Breadcrumbs\\" does give us the original Bond theme,<br />complete with that unforgettable guitar riff -<br />and follows it up with some fine 007 continuation<br />of its own.  \\"Skyfall\\" -<br />Bond's return to his ancestral home -<br />contains some moody lonely harmonics.<br />And I did like the<br />aptly-named \\"Adrenaline\\" with its mysterious aurals.<br /><br />But for one brought up on John Barry at his best (ON HER MAJESTY'S<br />SECRET SERVICE), Barry's successor David Arnold (CASINO ROYALE),<br />and even the strangely apt music of Eric Serra (GOLDENEYE).<br />I do have to say I was expecting just a little more.  And I do think<br />Newman's music distracted from the film itself.<br /><br />But then, perhaps, we expect too much these days?
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|The theme revolving around love and its accompanying 'symptoms' or 'side-effects' provided a lot of food for thought, especially for youth who are learning to make choices about love and how to act upon their feelings. Lauren Oliver proves to be a  masterful storyteller. The present tense narration comes across as natural and fitting. I also enjoyed the second book and am impatiently awaiting the final.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are no other words to describe this story but amazing!!!  Couldn't put it down.  After I read it I had to read it another two times immediately because it was so amazing!
B00ANW33CM|4.0|I really liked it because it keeps me busy with trying to figure it out but have a hard time understanding how the levels work.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|I tried this product and while i have large hands it still felt too large. The thumb stick is in an awkward position and if i wanted to use the wsad buttons i'd just use my keyboard. I recommend the Nostromo over this and its usually cheaper too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although I've always found Downton Abbey to be brilliant technically, with superb camera work, lighting and editing.  Season 2's story lines seemed to let me down however.  There was a certain level of ridiculousness that I just couldn't get behind. Season 3 has rectified that problem.  the scripts are much more coherent, the characters more consistent, and the plot lines more believable.  I also liked the surprises that prove that the filmmakers aren't afraid to shake things up a bit!<br /><br />I also have to mention the fact that Amazon's stream looks terrific.  Very little artifacting, good sound sync and very good color representation (for an 8 bit image).  Well done Amazon!
B007REV4YI|3.0|If you like Bond, you are going to buy this movie, nothing I can say can deter you from that. But here is what I found wrong with this bond flick:<br /><br />The henchmen in Skyfall are exactly what Austin Powers makes fun of. The henchmen had Bond captured with gun pointed at him, then for no reason walk closer to him while the villain monologues. When the villain is done chit-chatting the henchman now has his gun pressed against Bond, so now Bond can disarm him and get away! This is not a one time ordeal, it happens at least three times in Skyfall.<br /><br />The plot isn't even that great. It's a chase movie, basically, with the villain being a computer hacker. Yawn! The movie is acted well by all the cast members which is why ratings are higher than they should be, but it's just not that exciting. The opening gets you all pumped up, and the rest of the movie lets you down. And seriously, the Home Alone ending? I thought I was watching a 1991 action film where they were all confined to a building, bus, or airplane.<br /><br />Not a great Bond film, but a little better than Quantum of Solace.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Very different, great acting and a most unusual film.  Some parts were quite funny - it's not a weep-fest....until........<br />William Macy was excellent as the priest.  Very well done!  Recommended!!!
B004EIZCPM|4.0|Similar mood and tone to Juno.  It's an easy and light film.  If you liked other high school films check this one out too.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Unfortunately this book was sent wirelessly (probably my error when ordering) and I do not have Wi Fi and did not receive it - so the rating is not derogatory to the book as I am unable to rate it. I am hoping that when I am able to connect to Wi Fi it will come through.
B007Y36K46|4.0|seeing the book brought to life even with the changes is cool.  as much bad publicity as it got for not making disney their money back its a good pic
0547391005|5.0|I remembered these stories from my childhood way before they had the cartoon series on TV, now I can share some of my favoritre childhood stories with my little girls.  My 5 year old can read the stories all by herself.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book the only regret is reading it on Kindle its hard to go back to review some things.
0062200909|5.0|Well done. I got this book just in time for a trip. So, thanks for your quick turnaround on this item.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Outstanding continuation to an amazing story. Sam's reluctance to continue in the family business presents a compelling dilemma to their ongoing quest to erradicate evil.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play, takes no major thought processes, and you can easily pass a couple of hours before you realize it.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|When I was a teenager, Lurlene McDaniel was all the rage with books that had enriching titles like [[ASIN:B0021G3ZNU Too Young to Die]]. Beautiful happy girls got leukemia, fell in love, struggled, etc. Sometimes they survived. But they always learned more about Love and Life and Faith and Meaning.<br /><br />So it was weird when I was reading Shiver and kept thinking about how lycanthropy was the leukemia of this world. It forces you to face the mortality of your human life, and exchange risk for risk. There's even a chemotherapy scene of sorts.<br /><br />I thought the characters were drawn around central identifiers, and did not stray far from them. Grace is practical and straightforward and \\"good\\". Olivia is a photographer fascinated by wolves. Sam is sweet and thoughtful and an emo songwriter. I think the most interesting and flexible character was Isabel, the stuck-up rich girl with the toy Chihuahua. In the end, it is Isabel's assertiveness and willingness to break the rules that \\"saves the day\\".<br /><br />One of the things that redeems this book from being entirely forgettable is the occasionally luminous writing.<br />\\"Their tongues melted my skin; their careless teeth ripped at my sleeves and snagged through my hair, pushed against my collarbone, the pulse at my neck.\\"<br />or<br />\\"When Dad came down from his room, he found me sitting in the middle of a sea of splintered wood and snapped strings, like a boat carrying music had crashed on a rocky shore.\\"<br /><br />Read if: You miss cancer books. You want to be able to talk about hit YA books of the decade. You'd like an more-or-less interesting take on werewolves.<br /><br />Skip if: You are not reading to be popular. You are a character-based reader.<br /><br />Also read:<br />[[ASIN:B007ZHZWTU Silver Moon (A Women of Wolf's Point Novel)]] for another interesting werewolf spin.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This adapter does exactly what it's supposed to, i.e. allows you to connect Firewire hard drives to a Mac computer that has a Thunderbolt port. Be aware, however, that this adapter will only supply enough power to run ONE external drive at a time. If you want to daisy-chain multiple Firewire drives together through this one adapter, each hard drive beyond the first one will have to be powered by its own AC adapter. If you try to connect two hard drives that aren't AC-powered, the Mac operating system will freak out and instantly eject all the drives connected through the adapter.<br /><br />I use this adapter with three drives attached at the same time and it works fine: two AC-powered drives and a bus-powered drive.<br /><br />The Apple website states that this adapter provides up to 7W of bus power, so daisy chaining bus-powered devices is theoretically possible if you stay under the 7W limit - but I don't think you can find two hard drives that would consume less than 7W of power.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|When I take photos, I love great results!  After purchasing my Kindle fro Amazon, on of the first programs available for download is the HD Camera.  I downloaded it right away, and it does a beautiful job with photos.  I have a lot of great photos and actually am very pleased with the HD Kindle Camera!  If you have or are going to get a Kindle from Amazon, definitely consider downloading the HD Camera, you won't regret the results!!
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|I don't often get into TV series. Up until season 8 began, I have been obsessed with this show. Season 8 seems to have changed directlon a little and it seems a little 'soapy' I&#34;m hoping the show gets back on the track it was on previously.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The plot continues to thicken. Surprising deaths of some characters I thought would be with us to the end. The greatest zombie series ever!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|While I love the new graphics and additional actions, this app stopped loading after only one day.  Nothing I do will make it work properly.  I guess I could remove it and reinstall it, but then I would lose everything I've earned so far.
1475143389|5.0|Like many, I never learned how to eat and exercise in a formal manner. I guess I just picked things up along the way. A couple of years ago, I weighed 340 lbs; I decided enough was enough, so through diet and exercise I lost approximately 170 lbs. Every couple of years, I get the bug and decide I want to weight train; I basically copy the regulars I see at the gym, coupled with youtube videos and sparse internet sites to learn which exercises to perform. The results I got were fine, but there was always something dis-satisfying about them. I always thought that there was an impasse, that my body would never look the same in comparison to someone that was born with the right genes. I bought this book, and the first thing I noticed were literature references. Mike lays things out with facts, not here say and speculation. He goes through how to diet, how to exercise and why things should be done in the manner he lays out. When I first tried things as Mike suggested, I was skeptical. I went to the gym and the first week everything hurt. This is typically what one expects of a good workout. I guess it's kind of an indication that you did things right; that you pushed yourself too the limit of muscle building acuity, but after that, nothing. I became even more skeptical, but kept going. I told myself that I would give this a real chance. One day, I am in my bedroom, with my shirt off. I look in the mirror...INCREDIBLE! I didn't even know it was happening, but there was definitely muscle and definition, and after only 5 weeks. Like I've said, I've been to the gym on an off over the years, and I have never seen results like these. You should definitely buy this book, read it, give it a chance, and take it seriously. You might be skeptical ,you might not even feel like you've had much of a workout, but give it a chance. You'll see, like I have, that your patience will be rewarded. I guess if I could sum up this review, I would say BUY THIS BOOK.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I love musicals and dance and this updated version of Footloose really is a winner.  Well acted, good story line, and of course fabulous music and dance.  Footloose keeps running through my mind - it's like 'It's a small world'.  :-) Once it gets in your mind it doesn't want to leave.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I love to build computers, and I was getting ready to build a new gamer.  I did a lot of looking around before I made my final decision.  I decided that the 3820 i7 would get the job done.  I ordered it, installed it - and I was right!  The new computer is Fast and powerful!!  I am very happy with this processor, it can easily handle anything that I throw at it- an not even break a sweat!  I absolutely love it!  I even let a couple of friends take a test drive on my new computer, and they were ecstatic!  I picked this processor up at Amazon, they had the best price along with 2 day shipping.  I really can't stand sitting around and wait for a slow shipper!  So if you're looking for a great processor for gaming than I can assure you the Intel i7 3820 will not disappoint you!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Didn't watch the show when it was on TV, but started on-line with prime. Got through the first season and all I can say is wow.  Great progression of the storyline makes the action even more interesting.  Watch it!
B0012FB58I|5.0|If you appreciate raw and evolutionarily influential music, then you must give credit to this album even if you don't particularly care for its music.  A ground breaking album that laid some of the foundations of what punk rock eventually became. Unique sound and soulful, as well as, highly under recognized, this album is a must as part of any serious rock collection.
1592407889|3.0|While I believe most of what Sachi has written to be mostly true, My gut instinct is that on the whole she is an unreliable narrator. A lot of things did not ring true to me, and some of the anecdotes seemed very far-fetched and fantastical.  For example, the Mexican farm family story, the prostitute story and the stranded in Yugoslavia story. I 'm not saying they weren't true, they just seemed a little \\"off\\", a little too romantic. And not claiming her inheritance?  If only to keep it out of the hands of that borderline evil woman, surely? The accusations of the tight-fistedness of her mother, specifically not paying for her college education,  seemed like we weren't being told the whole story.  If we are, that seems to be the worst thing she did, other than not being present in her life, shipping her off to live with \\"the clone.\\" Coming down with the 104-105 degree fever the day she was deposed seems rather convenient: an excuse in case she is confronted in the future with what she swore to in a court of law. Does what she testified to conflict with this account? It seems credible to me that her mother may have been trying to protect her from being hurt in the \\"Closing the Ring\\" disappointment, rather than conspiring against her. Who knows?  Despite all of the revelations concerning Shirley's treatment of her, the fact remains that she ended up on her feet, a seemingly happy life, married for 11 years to a pillar of society, with a nice family. She seems to have kept her sense of humor and perspective. Certainly, Ms Maclaine was not a great mother, and nutty as a fruitcake, but seems to have had her best interests at heart, even if she make some bad choices.  I found the book to be engaging, and laugh-out-loud funny in many places. I hope they can come to some kind of understanding and reconcile
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show. Great actors, storyline, cinemetography and all. I highly recommend this show to anyone who desires to watch good television.
B003521R6G|3.0|I liked this one, but it is dated and I really prefer the 2011 remake.  Kevin Bacon did a marvelous job, but so doesn't Kenny Wormald.  The few changes that were made really did make a difference - the reason for his going to live with his Uncle, divorce vs death, the attitude of the uncle and the diversification of the cast made a real difference.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|When I got my new Kindle Fire, I wanted to check out the games, and apps.  I saw the UNO game and downloaded it right away, the only problem I have with the UNO game is once I start playing - I don't want to stop!!  You get so many styles of this game to choose from, and you can play it with other or by yourself.  They have computer players play against you - sweet!  It is a riot to play and it keeps me on my toes!  If you like a great card game, try UNO! Amazon gives you so many choices with the Kindle Fire, I am never bored playing with it on my free time.  Try it out!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Watched on the app for the Wii. Over G wifi. Rebuffered twice during the movie. Good picture though. Enjoyed the movie.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|A fun ride but also a scary one to think what some pilots might do on their days off . But this was a well done movie and everything you come to expect from Denzel , one of the best actors of our day . Goodman is fun as well .. A very sobering message at the end too .
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like hidden mystery games and its cool that you never really finish the game :) it would be cool if they had the vampire hidden mystery
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was well written and very witty. It is definitely a tear-jerker but definitely worth the tears! Great book for dog enthusiasts of all ages!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book. Twisted and creepy! I couldn't put it down. Every step a new twist, I can't wait to read another from Gillian Flynn
B008J05EL8|4.0|After I had purchased my new Kindle Fire, another one of the first programs that I wanted in my Kindle Fire was an office!  I am in an online college, and when I travel have to at least do some homework and keep tabs on what's going on at the college.  I downloaded the Office suite from Amazon, and it works Awesome!  The only thing that I lacked was a choice of fonts.  Shortly after I got the office suite up and running,  a pop-up came on while I was in Word.  It was a the recommendation of the OfficeSuite Font Package.  It's very inexpensive, so I downloaded it right away - problem solved!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Love it. Gravity is spot on. Great to see new levels after an update.<br />Keep it up. Going to try their other apps.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this app is absolutely fantastic. the music is relaxing and the levels are great fun to play. five stars easy.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Megan Scott is tired of listening to the two women who are sharing a table and drinks with her in a casino in Las Vegas. Twelve hours later, Megan is in a hotel room, hanging over a toilet retching. Trying to piece together the night, she remembers meeting Connor Reed in the casino, going on a fake date, gambling and drinks. But she didn't know how she had ended up in an all night chapel and getting married to Connor. Right after the retching, Megan tells Connor they need a lawyer. But Connor wasn't prepared to call it quits, even under the unusual circumstances, basically he liked what he saw in Megan. Connor gets Megan to finally agree to the marriage for three months; but Megan tells him no sex. Connor tells Megan their marriage is real and that he plans to seduce her, to which she tells him she will resist. His reply is, &#34;You can try&#34;.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|i got the freeversion and it is a great game! the graphics and game play are excellent.love using tennis pros and love daily challenges!
B004FEL6GO|5.0|My nephew was thrilled with this gift. I thought it was small when it arrived in the mail, but on Christmas Day, it was a great success.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|When I saw this program in the app section of my Kindle Fire, it has great ratings and I had to have it. I purchased it, this Photo program is inexpensive, especially compared to the prices of photo software for a full size computer.  I love to edit my photos - if needed- and after loading some new pics in my Kindle, I gave this program a try.  I love it, the photos I edited came out awesome and and I couldn't be happier.  if you have a tablet - this is a must have. I must say that Amazon does have a lot of great apps to add to the Kindle, and they are are inexpensive and some of the apps and games are free!
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Any time I watch a movie based on a true story, I always wonder how true to the story the movie actually is. This download included special interviews with the actual people the story is based on. I loved how close and accurate the story is to the actual events that took place. It made me appreciate and value the story more than it would have w/o watching the interviews.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is addicting and entertaining.  cant stop playing virtual city playground.  definitely a thumbs up!  wish it didn't want to connect to facebook though.  I like that it levels up pretty fast.
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|my husband loves this cd! it is exactly what hes been wanting. no issues w/ shippment or packaging. product is perfect.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game. Its very addictive.  Love that its fee. Its a lot smoother then first game. A lot more challenging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so cool but it deleaded all my players I am mad about and I had so many players
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This came in handy during NEMO.  I downloaded it and it had live updates from all over the states that I watched. Love it.
B0085W09ME|5.0|User friendly. I browse the flight daily and they are categorize according to the price and name of the airline. But most of all the nos of hrs of travel time involved on different airlines.. For people that has health issue it is important because they might be sitting in the airport for long hours. I have not purchased a ticket yet but I will definitely used this app in the very near future. I will recommend this to everyone I know.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found. It does exactly what I was looking. My wife loves it.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Seems like an interesting show. SciFi and not over the top. But I'll watch one or two more just to waste time.
B003K07DUC|2.0|This is just the normal shoot 'em up movie.  The plot is shallow, and the acting is only fair at best.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A wonderful read!<br />I would recommend this book to my children and friends..<br />Many twists and turns right up until the end.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I can play this for hours and when you reach a certain score it turns you off and wants you to pay for a full version.  I don't want that monthly charge.  I keep playing over the same levels and its very exciting and precise with the movements.
B000002MFE|5.0|You can't be a fan of Slowhand and not have this album. Listening to this album with my Grado cans feels like I am getting a personal show!
B001F12J0C|5.0|This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found.<br />It does exactly what I was looking for it to do.
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|I was all excited to plug my Iphone 5 in and use it in bed and it just didn't work.  I was so disappointed.  Not not buy this product.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has great graphics and allows you to care for a realistic horse without the expense of an actual horse. I recommend this game for any horse lover.
0446569895|3.0|If there was an individual who really tried to kill himself and utterly failed, it's Ozzy! He really tries here, and though it is not up to par with The Dirt level of Rock n' Roll autobiographies, Ozzy is as candid as he is allowed to be; which is why I give it three stars. His facts are muddled and hazy. And, there's a lot of rehash from Sharon's autobiography that gets a rearranged treatment here. Ever the watchful eye, Sharon made sure Ozzy would not cast himself in too negative a light. But, isn't that what an autobiography is supposed to be - a ball's to the wall confession. Not always pretty, but damn entertaining. There's a lot Ozzy avoids talking about here; and while Ozzy can be excused due to the fog of excessive drug and alcohol abuse, the rehashing of events in a different order from Sharon's earlier published autobiography is not something one can overlook. I just wish Ozzy felt the freedom to really let go and talk candidly about his past and his feelings about that past, instead of holding back because someone was looking over his shoulder.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have to sign in and out to make facebook update.  I am not sure what is wrong with this software.  I eventually get to view and post after turning on and off a few times.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|This is one magnificent game that could keep me busy for hours.  I have been playing it on Windows 8, now I am happy to have it on the Kindle Fire.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found. It does exactly what I was looking for it to do.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|One of the greatest Sci-Fi shows ever at a time when their isn't that many good Sci-Fi's. Wish it could of gone on longer!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|First I rejected this game but now I'm. Having a blast. Great job with this one. It is very fun. I can see myself killing a lot of boredom with this game.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|A must buy for movie lovers. This old classic in new packing is of awesome print quality. Additional features are great too. Highly recommended.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Great reading was this trilogy! Lived up to the expectations I'd had,when I heard about the series<br />Read in order as the story is continuous.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Quality and order process was great.  HD quality and instant on demand makes it fun to order<br />Movie was average.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|Not as easy as it looks, It's going to take a lot of practice to get the hang of using this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|had alot of fun playing this game, highly reccomended to everyone who likes strategy, and figuring out lots of puzzles.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best series I've seen!<br /><br />I started watching this from a friend's recommendation, and I am HOOKED! It is phenomenal!
B0027GGL6W|4.0|Chronicles the birth of urban Chicago blues and segues into the eventual offshoot of the blues, Rock and Roll and Rhythm and Blues.<br />The story narrated by legendary blues song writer and bass player, Willie Dixon is a bit embellished but captures the tension of the Chicago South and West side and the music that emanates from that tension.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I like the product, I love the color. But I wish it had a hook for the stylus! Other than that it is great!
B0040I09RM|5.0|I started watching the show on TV starting with season 3.  It is great to catch up from the beginning of the series.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really good. Usually I have a little liking to animal games but this one is awesome. And it is FREE
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved this book from the moment I started it and the ending was a complete surprise.<br />A wonderful read
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Really liked the story, not what I expected, was looking for a typical romance. It really surprised me and I would recommend this book to everyone!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I tend to gravitate toward films from the UK. This ensemble cast is exceptional and for 3 of these actors, their roles were a stretch. Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton were not particularly likable characters (especially Penelope) and they were outstanding. I felt embarrassed and awkward for them but was rooting for them as well, even though I just couldn't like them very much. In the end, it was a story about real life in a sort of fantasy setting. If you're not a contemplative person, this film may not be for you. I loved it!
B0001N9ZKW|3.0|I like the title song the best.Some of the other songs were good,but the title song was the best song.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I'm practicing the game and i think it's me not the game.  Jewels Stars would be better for someone quicker, but I'm not giving up!!!!
B007VGXS8M|5.0|It's Gone ---I want it back-- It was one of my favorite games until it was removed by Kindle Fire --I paid for this game and now it seems it is unavailable. Why rate an app if no one does anything about it?<br /><br />Jim Miller
B007SGM084|3.0|I had heard so much about this series maybe my expectations were too high...<br />It was good but basically a series of romance novels......
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show very much. The actors are outstanding and the era is so beautiful.<br />What a great show to watch.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|This app does what it says and you can mix and match background sounds. I think folks would be happy with the performance of the app.
B00138J234|4.0|Good album from a band long gone. Needed to add this to my colection for a long time but now I got it.
B00AGVNIAW|3.0|This book is full of pretty pictures and I thought I'd enjoy reading it on my Kindle (since I read SMP every day on my computer), but the formatting is not great electronically.  I wish I purchased the hard copy.
0425252868|5.0|I have to admit, I've never written a review for anything including a restaurant. This book is a fantastic read. I purchased on e-books on a Monday and by Thursday morning I was done. I couldn't put it down. Adam transforms you into the skies of Europe. A wonderfully written book that for all WWII readers is a must read. Highly recommended. You will not be sorry on this purchase. Enjoy!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|To go back in time is all our wish. To go back and change the past would be scary for all.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is quite exciting.  Really action packed with great character development  I got hooked after watching it on Netflix and had to purchase these episodes through Amazon on my ROKU.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Processor works fine and is very easy to work with. Makes for a great gaming machine. We stick with Intel.
B000FC10MU|4.0|American Gods by Neil Gaiman is a thrilling, thought-provoking tale of forgotten God's and their quirky existence on Earth.<br />A long read, worth every minute, this book paints a picture of our world that is dark, delicious and delightfully wrought with deeply disturbed characters. I really enjoyed the story and writing style. Highly recommended for the dark masses.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is wonderful.  I love it and am waiting with bated breath for Season 3 video that is free.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|After buying all three of the albums and listening to them, I found Set the World on Fire to be my favorite. BVB has a great selection of songs on this album!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Highly recommend this series! It will hook you in and leave you wanting more! Plenty of drama, excitement and laughter throughout!
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|The app is good, however, I found the downloads to be slow. There is a wide variety of books to choose from. It s a good app but I found I, have to  be patient with the app, because it does not always respond quickly.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I really thought the story was creative and appreciated how much thought must have gone into all the aspects of changing history due to time travel. I was entertained and I liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Read The Book Thief if you love books about the Holocaust, coming of age, purpose-driven living, and death.<br />Flowing with vignettes so real, you are bound to be transported, this book is presented from the perspective of death. Yes, death, who jokes about our human perception of his arrival sporting a sickle. Death as narrator, wonderful! Wish I had thought of it, but I didn't. Read it.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|What an amazing read. I am fascinated by, and know so very little, about the science of space. I hope to see manned interplanetary travel in my lifetime, so this book was a wonderful, believable, rich story. Hilarious AND suspenseful. Thanks for putting so much time into a technical, but wholly approachable, novel!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Visuals are great and easy to comprehend.  Gives details in a macro or micro level.  Very nice app to have.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|To think, I thunk my grammar stunk.<br />'Til I was saved by William Strunk.<br />Quotations willy-nilly, my writing was quite silly.<br />If your book is an ingredient in slush pile stew,<br />You'll benefit from an Elements of Style review.<br />-VL Brunskill
B000SXLL8O|5.0|After getting into Coldplay on their Viva la Vida album and then Mylo Xyloto, I thought I should check out their previous releases. Found Parachutes MP3 on Amazon for $5. I love this album! Every song is amazing! I remember the songs, \\"Trouble\\" & \\"Yellow\\" but didn't know the rest. If you don't have it it's def. a must have!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm not creative and Pinterest has the best ideas and I do plan on trying some and can't wait.  There is just too much to explore and to look at.  The ideas are amazing!
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Quite enjoyable, very good in places and then tends to drag on in parts. Have read better Kate Morton books.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|A very good James Bond movie.  Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. A good action packed movie as are all the Daniel Craig 007 movies.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My daughter loves this game and has so much fun.  She likes the life like animals and how you are able to feed them.
