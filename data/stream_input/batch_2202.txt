030758836X|1.0|I wanted to like this book but it started out kind of slow to me...then it became somewhat predictable...then I debate just stopping but rule that out because, \\"it has to get better since it has been so highly rated & recommended right?\\" How wrong was I! After finishing it I am just mad I spent the time to read this...such a horrible ending...although not predictable...but maybe that's because most authors, I would think, would want to give a satisfying ending for their readers!! It didnt even have to be one a reader would be rooting for completely...just anything other than that!<br /><br />A few days later...<br />OK, I was a little upset right after putting the book down. I still think this book is a stinker, but after thinking about it more...it's not the ending per say. It's the characters. I could not identify or like a single one of them if I tried. Including the diary entries. And when you don't like any of the characters how can you like any ending? I still would never recommend this book. Save the $10 and the time....
B00095NX9G|5.0|The footage definitely gives you your money's worth.  Wow! Over two hours of dance and over an hour of yoga.  It isn't easy.  Not for whiny beginners.  I'm a beginner, but I was willing to work through the video executing one move at a time.  If you're a beginner who loves a challenge and has patience with yourself, you'll enjoy this DVD.<br /><br />Intermediate dancers will surely learn a lot and gain useful techniques for a professional polish.  I will get great mileage from this DVD and it will serve as a permanent reference as I advance in my dance skills.
0385366752|3.0|This is one of the better audio books that I have heard as far as narrators go. I appreciate the producers bringing in two actors to play the main characters instead of only having one actor for both the male and female narration.<br /><br />This book did rope me in. It was a roller coaster of emotions and opinions of the main characters. From previous reviews I knew that there was a big plot twist somewhere in the story and I spent a lot my time listening trying to predict what that would be. In the end I wish that I would have read this instead of listening to it. I can read a lot faster than an actor can narrate and I think I would have been happier if it didn't take so long to get to the end.<br /><br />Oh the end... it really pissed me off. I hated, loathed and fantasized about murdering some of these characters myself. In some ways it is a testament to a writer's ability to be able to elicit such emotions from her readers. However, I wish I had never read/ listened to this story at all.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I have tried several of the different Sudoku apps for the android phone and this one is the best One I have used so far
B0059DL0UC|4.0|I gave this book four stars because it explained pilates to me with anatomical illustration, which is what a visual person like myself needs. I felt that it provided a solid foundation for me to understand the processes that are going on within and what the intended results are to be. This was my first book on the subject and thus I have nothing to compare it to, but in my opinion, it was pretty good and I'm glad that I purchased it.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I borrowed this film from my co-worker and saw it with my dad. When I first saw the movie I thought &#34;Meh, it's alright.&#34; I had expected it to be funnier and a little less cheesy. I will say this though, the A Capella covers were great! I loved the music. I did not expect this movie to stay on my mind for the rest of the week!<br /><br />Since I could not get this flick off of my mind, I decided to purchase it. Upon watching it a 2nd time, I fell in love! Everything about Pitch Perfect was flawless to me. There were so many things that I had not noticed the first time that added so much laughter and enjoyment to this film. It's goofy, quirky, fun and at times, cheesy but it's the good cheesy you can enjoy.<br /><br />My favorite things about Pitch perfect are these: Fat Amy and Jesse. Cynthia Rose is also pretty great.<br /><br />So all in all, I give this flick a 4. It did not sell me the first time but since then I've seen it 4 more times and I loooooooooove it. LOOOVE it. If you did not think it was great the first time, I strongly suggest you give it another chance.
B000FC1AOI|4.0|I have wanted to read this ever since I saw the movie. While I did enjoy the movie I loved the book so much more. I can't wait to read more of Cecelia Ahern' s books.
B0094KF4WG|3.0|In order to make a book-length story of a navy seal's experience, there was a great deal of factual material about the author's personal experience before the actual attack on Bin Laden.  The events in the book were presented in a very forthright style which was appropriate for this kind of book.  Of course, it had a very satisfactory ending--a tale of the day the Western world heaved a sigh of relief.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I will buy many copies to share with friends, this book is great on so many levels.  I am going to re read it soon.
B0096632NG|5.0|There are still signature dance beats to this album however some like to say that she has a more mature aspect on this one over Lights. I still like Ellie Goulding after this album also.
B0086QS7N2|3.0|I can't really say I like this album but it doesn't suck either. Rush will never do anything as good as those adventurous albums they did in the 70s or early 80s, but at least they dared to do a concept album and try something adventurous again. Diehard Rush fans should like it. Favorite tracks are: Seven Cities Of Gold, Headlong Flight, Caravan.
B005KCTQSK|5.0|I really like Ellie Goulding. She writes her own lyrics and melodies. Plus she lays down some good guitar tracks.
B00AH69BPM|5.0|If you like adventurous heavy metal, you should like this EP. Anyone into Metallica should have this EP. If you liked Death Magnetic you'll dig this EP.
B009LHWEKW|4.0|Bought episode 15 and it was a solid episode.  Recommended to anyone who missed the broadcast premiere of this episode.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I was shocked at how good the Zeppers play on this show. Never would've believed that in 2007 these guys would re-unite and produce something so killer. The standout performances for me are Dazed & Confused and Kashmir. When I saw Dazed & Confused in the set list I thought &#34;wow, yet another live version of D & C, as if there aren't enough already.&#34; Well, this version is very enjoyable because they keep it down to about 12-13 minutes, and Jimmy just plays with a psychedelic vibe that is as good as anything I've ever heard him play. After the Beatles, Zep is the greatest rock band ever. They're certainly my favorite hard/rock band of all time. Celebration Day is highly recommended.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|The new and improved reboot of Hawaii Five-0 is a must watch. Audiences will be blown away by the action packed episode which are completed with clever comedy, smart scripts, sincere performances, and vibrant Hawaiian landscapes. This modern take of a timeless classic will fascinate and entertain people of all ages. Highly recommended!
B008B92U32|4.0|This is a funny app. Would get 4 starts if you could not only swap but also put one face on two faces in the pic. Does get boring after a while.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|Althought I liked the first edition to this sequil, I didn't much care for the ending or the plot its's self. It was visually striking and the actors did a wonderful performance. It could of been better.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Great little app. Gives a nice workout, is easy to use, and gives enough choices to make nice varied workouts.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|A clock big enough to read at night without my glasses.  I have not tried the alarm feature but will in the near future and I am sure it will be as good as the clock.
0226264211|4.0|This book helps to show how freedom can endure without growing government influence into fundamental aspects of our lives. Most of the proponents of enlarging government use a type of mythology not grounded in real world outcomes that can be supported by empirical evidence.
B0063IH60K|4.0|My kids and grand kids have had hours of fun with the Solitaire download.  Keeps them busy and quite, and to keep those girls quite is a chore, even though they all are 18 years old and older.  One day I will try playing with it.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Wonderful album. Press play on number 1 and listen to it straight through. Macklemore has such talent and raps about a lot of important subjects that normally aren't spoken of. Everyone should have a copy of this regardless of what genre you are normally into.
B005HSL626|5.0|fruit ninja is the bomb. it is like your actually slicing fresh fruit to make a fruit salad or punch. I think the only reason sensi has you slicing fruit is so that he can eat it himself. but that is okay.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|no search engine for finding songs to purchase.  too dificult to find what I want to buy too difficult to navigate
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway sitters. it is like temple run but has better graphics( no offense temple run).<br /><br />next to temple run this game has stole my heart.
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book, even if you've never played the game (I'm sure there is someone). It's a great looking book, wonderful pages, and amazing background of everything zelda related.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|jetpackjoyride is a wonderful game. I recommend it for any age as long as they don't have epilepsy. a lot of blinking lights are involved. so jetpackjoyride is perfect. just be careful:)!!!!!!
B00BHMF578|5.0|great movie, Ben Affleck did an amazing job , based on true story, worth watching,highly recommended , great quality too
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This one was good just when  I think it is getting too mushy. It changes. Looking forward to the last one now.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love that I can check my emails on my kindle.it is very easy and fast. It lets you know when you have new emails also. It is so great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i like this game , its interesting you can buy things to upgrade your person that you have and its good for skill too .
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very intense and action packed movie. I felt like I was with this group in their dangerous attempt to get out of Iran. History is sometimes is thrilling.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a great tool for homework and challenges. It's a perfect calculator at your fingertips. It's also very easy to use and I suggest it to anyone at any age.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked this book because it has a good hummer Dustin gndhdbdb b. Gndhdbdb. High-end  b gig high high vvv
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Okay most of you know about temple run. Well if you like that game your going to like this. If you don't your going to like this. Honestly I completely recommend Subway Surfers to anyone and everyone.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|I have all the books and movies, so far. Will buy them all. I thought all the actors did a great job.
B004CAWKXE|5.0|Look alive, Sunshine. 109 on the sky live, but the pigs won't quit. It's me, Dr. Death Defy. I'll be your surgeon, your proctor, your helicopter...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is so cool because you get to run, run, run, and RUN!! You get to watch a fat guy run after you, and you have to dodge the trains! You can change your character, board, and get awesome headstarts, trophies, and coins from mystery boxes. Have fun!!!!!!!!
B00A6RVRXG|4.0|I'm new to the band and received the cd as a gift. The music is fresh, honest and deceptively simple. Without bombast, the music has real drive and is even more effective in its low-key and confident approach. Intelligent guitar rock that's easy to like but still intellectualy nutritious.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really fun. whoever does not have this game is missing out a lot. a cool thing about it is u get to also go into different worlds.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|I am old enough to remember the original Animals: House of the Rising Sun. At that time I heard something in Mr. Burdon's voice that moved me. I have been a fan ever since. &#34;Til Your River Runs Dry &#34; is an excellent CD. Mr. Burdon's voice still moves me.
B00466HNHM|5.0|Exreamly well done i've already watched it over a dozen times since I received the movie kevin costner & whitney huston together was like a hand fitting perfect in a glove
B008220DIC|2.0|There's a better movie in here somewhere<br /><br />The Master is PTA's attempt at a John Steinbeck novel.  So much so, I felt as if Of Mice and Men was unfolding from time to time.  But then when a scene would end, I was thrown into a John Cassavettes film of explosive human emotion.  After that, I couldn't remember what I was watching.  Then they ride a motorcycle and then England and it's over.<br /><br />The large format and ambient light photography preach to high hopes.  The actors are all faultless.  And somewhere in there, there's a great film.  But this isn't it.<br /><br />All the good stuff is on the surface, below that, it's paper thin.  PTA pretty much left anything interesting on the editing floor, or for some other movie.  Essentially, you see what you want to believe in the Master.  So it may work for you or against the film.  But having seen it twice now, I can confirm the following.<br /><br />The photography and lighting are great.<br />The performances are solid<br /><br />That's it.<br /><br />He really is becoming more and more like Terrence Malick every day which is disappointing because the real Masters write their own book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a blast! In my case it is much better than temple run. I love all the new improvements in temple run 2 which are much better than temple run in my world.<br /><br />This review was made In March 3 2013 ( just gonna say it in case the dates get messed up). More updates will come out and this review will be a bit off the game from the time you see it now ( or at least manet). But if you want to know at least the way temple run 2 started out then you may read this review or read it just because you want to.<br /><br />Temple Run 2 is amazing! It features many new features like a rope in which you slide, 1 big monkey, and many features that I will explain later. Before I start the review officially, I am not good with grammer and I will never be. Well, I am, but not to talk about the game in a review. Well then, lets continue.<br /><br />The games graphics are one thing that I love about trample run 2. I'm not saying the graphics in the first temple run are bad but in temple run 2 they are improved. Graphics to some people are the main focus of how they like a game or not. I am not one of those people but many are. The best graphics are on the I pad, they always will be the best on ipad because it is one of the best tablets. I do not have the ipad but certainly will get one ina matter of time. This did not go along with what I was saying about temple run 2 ( graphics) , but its ok. This is really fast but I am not typing in paragraphs if you think I am, just in something I prefer as sections.<br /><br />Temple Run 2 has great music I can enjoy playing temple run 2 because the music is relaxing. I get to play and hear the music at the same time. really quick... again. I might not put every starting sentence with a capital letter. this is just because I do not want to keep clicking the capitalize button.<br /><br />temple run 2 has Smoth gameplay. I can just slide my finger less than 1 in. in my screen (this may be inaccurate but you know what I mean!!!).I can feel the touching gameplay right at my hands and finger tips. It is so good the way that it feels with all the features combined. Im like not even lieing. It is so cool. Well at least the game is free so you don't have to read my review to see if you want to try it or not.<br /><br />If you do not have so many items downloaded, the game does not lag. After all, people do complain about that a game lags when they downloaded like 10,000 photos.<br /><br />You can get gems and coins for free. The gems are harder to find than coins. coins are all over the game. gems take more time to find but you can use them to make powrups last longer or to revive from a death in a game. But one part that I think is that your person that you use in temple run and temple run 2 is a zombie. you come back to life after the big monkey ate you like 100 times. This is true and you know it.<br /><br />Temple run 2 could get some more characters. temple run has more characters than temple run 2, temple run 2 has 4 zombies to use rather then temple run. temple run has around more than temple run 2. I don't<br /> know the names because I always just look at it so don't complain.<br /><br />Temple run 2 has rewards for each level up. you level up by doing objectives. gives you something to think about while playing the game.<br /><br />The leader boards and other things will not be explained. only reason I will not explain the rest is because I explained enough. and ( hey I just started a sentence with and, this proofs your teacher wrong) you should no this stuff already. The hidden secreat is IM NOT WRITING FOR YOU FOR MORE THAN 20 MINUTES!!!!! thank you for your understanding.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|The app is a great idea, well integrated, seamless and would be AWESOME if it were not so incredibly biased.  Huffington Post, Daily Koos and Al Jezerra are all defaults.  CNN, Fox, Bloomberg - can't find them.  When I searched why, Flipboard stated we you should be able to pull these feeds in the future by RSS - just not now (and not a default).  Seriously?  Not only complicated but also not available.  FOX and CNN are two biggest news channels!  I believe we should have access to all views (left, middle and right).  But to only promote one view is wrong - especially when presenting the app as a medium that (can pull all your media into one app).  If I wanted a biased app, I'd simply get Fox or MSNBC - at least I'd know their agenda.  Fight back and demand flipboard include and promote ALL feeds! Flipboard, I promise the sky will not crash down by including Fox - have more courage!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Just a little longer than the cable that comes in the box, this longer cable allows me to continue reading and not put my kindle away when my battery has had it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Elements of mental illness born of a disturbing past give this story teeth and it has a very tender love story as well. One of my very favorites I have read.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Came upon them on Pandora. Very impressed with style and content. They work very well together with a haunting sound and presentation.
B001QJUX24|5.0|Next to the Wild bunch this is my favorite movie, I have a standard definition copy but just ordered a blue ray copy. I can't understand why John Wayne did not even get an oscar nomination for his role.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Even though this book is not my usual genre to read , I thoroughly enjoyed the story.  The author did a nice job in the style of his writing so that you, the reader, get caught up in the characters flights of ideas. The book is definitely worth reading.  It gives an interesting look at mental illness
B0012FHGCW|2.0|Strange movie and I did not like the ending. I did like the cameo from Vince Vaughn and Kristen Stewart.
B009TZBEKW|4.0|But he ain't no Skrillex.  That being said, Calvin Harris has a chock full of great tunes on this album, my favorite being &#34;Let's Go&#34; and &#34;Feels So Close&#34;.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book kept my attention each time I had to put it down in between reading it. Very interesting, great story, easy read.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I wasn't too familiar with this duo but when I heard their hit song &#34;Thrift Shop&#34;, I decided to try the album.  I was impressed.  The rhyming skills are definitely on point, the subject matter is a breath of fresh air (how many times can you rap about drugs, strip clubs and hoes?), and the beats are tight.  Get this album.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Very good first album from an Idol winner. A couple of songs are hard to distinguish from the Dave Matthews Band, which would be better if Phillip came first. Looking forward to the second album to see if he can find his own sound.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This album clearly has an 80's vibe to it but not in a &#34;cheesy&#34; way.  A collection of well crafted songs and Bruno's signature singing makes this album that will surely have several hits before its lifespan is done.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read many Nicholas Sparks' books and I thought this book had some interesting twists! I would recommend it!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is only a adventure story on the surface, but that part is so creative, and compelling, it was hard to stop reading. Not only is this a story about faith, resilience and perseverance, it is a story about how to tell a story, and all the layers of truths of our human experience.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Remember how bad Stalone's movie was back in the 80's? Well this one is a bad-ass version with much better acting!
B006LSZECO|2.0|LOVED the first part of the book.  Couldn't put the book down.  It was the single WORST ending ever. I'm still deciding if I ever should have started reading it... Bummer.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was interested in watching the movie so I decided to read the book first (as I always do) and now I'm worried to watch the movie because I'm afraid I will be let down. What a wonderful book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game will suck you in and take you for a ride.  great way to kill time. interactive,  suspensful, and sometimes very difficult.  free game but the only way to get far is to Buy tokens and Gems- so that is where they get money from you.
B004OR199G|5.0|Filled with lots of FACTS!  Comically written and a fun read!<br />I could not put the book down! Everyone should read this book.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|1st season is just wonderful.  I like watching the characters develop and the stroy lines are good. Love the series
B002RI9UKE|2.0|I had heard so many people tell me I HAD to read the secret that I had huge expectations for what this book was going to reveal. What the Secret is can really be summed up in one paragraph and the rest of this book is just pointless filler. I was actually annoyed that I had spent money on what I thought was book but which in reality is a pamphlet.
B009C7JS14|4.0|its a weather app of my area ...lol better then the weather channels app and far better then weather bug which is loaded with spam...
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Given that 2012 was the year when a book was one of the most talked about topics of conversation there was no way to avoid reading Fifty Shades of Grey. Yes the characters are vain, stereotyped and unrealistic. Yes the sex scenes take up most of the book. Yes the book isn't exactly well written. However this book still has its place and deserves all the attention it has received. Why, because this is a book for women and women don't talk about sex, at least not in detail anyway. This book appeals to that voyeuristic side of us where we want to know what other people do but we don't want to ask. I say bravo to EL James for throwing caution to the wind and admitting that yes women do want to read about this and I think she deserves to have the last laugh.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|its an awesome game great strategy and action its absalutly awesome! you should deffinatly get this game. I reapeat its awesome!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Compared to &#34;Casino Royale&#34;, this film was a let down.  Bring back women in bikinis! I want to see more sex! and exotic locations.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a definite timekiller! But its also addictive and easy to understand!!! I think its something to get to fil time!!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Good audio and visual presentation. It enables me to better understand the historical characters I have read about and gain a better perspective of the part they played in England's history
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I chose this novel on the basis of Ian Mcewan's books I've already read. His plots and characters are always intriguing; his writing polished and concise. I don't think this novel measured up.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This version of Mahjong is fun and easy to win.  If you like the game then this one is for you and its a nice bonus that its free!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I ready this book in no time at all. Couldn't put it down. I loved all the twists and turns in the plot and at the end all my questions were answered. A easy read but great. Thanks!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy this version of Spider Solitaire.  I'm not very good at more than two colors anyway, but am encouraged to try again since so far I've been lucky with this product.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was so interesting and exciting, I couldn't stop reading. You must get it. I hope you love it like me.  :)
B0063IH60K|3.0|This version of Solitaire is ok, not particularly remarkable above other Solitare formats, but I still enjoy playing this game.
B002ZG974M|5.0|My baby girl loves watching this movie even more than we do.  Almost no talking throughout, soothing music, very cute babies, warm and at times humorous portrayals of the babies lives.  A beautiful documentary.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is allot like timple run but it is much better I love this app very much. I love this app !
0757302661|4.0|I used some of the breathing exercises described in this book, and it was positive in that it gave me something else to concentrate on rather than worrying about delivering my daughter.  They say if you can stay relaxed, that isn't necessarily everything, but it can often help ease the process, and I'd say certainly was the case here.  The book was overall more useful than the birthing class I attended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best way to make the government of Canada and the government of people say that there is no longer have the other day that there is a nutshell the your imagination of people who your your  your you your notes that is no way youtube video games in a nutshell is very important for us and you should be able and you should be able and you shouldGreat game and it's very fun. The best part is that there is no end like minecraft. If tutis you should look it and hey<br /> it but yeah Julio e Thu as game it
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I am so impressed of how some people can have such a strong effect on people. The book is even better than the first and that says a lot since the first book was unbelievably.... I don't find words to do this serie justice! READ IT!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app I recommend it to you it's very fun and challenging but I love it and it works on my kindle and iPhone.4  and iPad.the game in a nutshell is very fun and makes you think. Little kids love it and my friends and I love it I personally think. it's a five star game.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless is an easy but good read! It is hard to put down once you start reading. I liked it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|a true story that you can't stop waiting for the next thing to happen. deserved the oscar. saw it on my kindle-fire for $3.99 instead of $8.00 in movie or $21.99 for pay for view! YEAH Kindle-Fire!
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Very entertaining<br />Easy to read, as always adorable characters that suffer and love and live<br />If you like historic novels, this one's for you
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app cant wait to finish all of them so that I can hopefully find more puzzle apps.
B007R108WA|5.0|Intense and captivating all through till the end. Great performances by all the actors in the movie. Great streaming from Amazon services.
B00AFEY7QO|3.0|I've been a SOS fan since the 1980's.  Eventhough I've loved their music since that time, this CD was a minor disappointment, not because of the content, but because of the CD itself.  The CD I received had tracks that skipped, sometimes it's difficult to hear an entire song.  The DVD was extremely enjoyable.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|Love this movie...my only complaint is that Santa has two swords on him at all times.  Not the best accessory<br />for Santa Clause! Other than that, I have no complaints...sweet and touching movie.  The bad guy, Pitch, is<br />just the right blend of villain--not too scary.  Recommend this movie!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is one of the best stories I have heard in years.I love his music. It's a shame we did not know about him sooner
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Tipical Grisham work , easy reading , good.<br />I will recommend to my friends.<br />Portuguese version is welcome , so I can suggest it  locally.
B007NZQU72|4.0|The first half was very valuable--helpful knowledge, but did not care for the chapters dealing with different kinds of therapies.  I know she has written other books, but I don't think I would be interested in them.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The story began describing a wonderful, romantic relationship, and as events unfolded, it became clear that  Nick and Amy were both dishonest, self centered, scheming, nasty people that I couldn't empathize with at all, and that didn't cause me to care at all what happened to them. The entire story got more and more unbelievable. That, aside, it wasn't well written enough to make me take time to read anything else by Gillian Flynn.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Would definitely recommend!  My mother grew up in Germany around the same time as the main character.  Her stories are very similar.  This is a great read!  Definitely recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good book. The characters were well written and the plot was unique. While reading the book, all I could think about was the Fallout game series.
B00B7H3OFI|5.0|Love this departure for Bonnamassa. Just music to groove by. Reminds me of seventies jazz and funk, little like Jeff Beck.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I watched this movie because of all the Oscar hype. I was pleasantly surprised. Great movie all around and even though I already knew the outcome, I was on the edge of my seat.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was definitely better than i expected. I am not the romance novel type, however, I really enjoyed this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i don't know what you want me write about a calculator it works like a calculator should happy happy happy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very amazing game though when something like an ad would pop up, the game would freeze and not let me play for a very long time. this may be a bug with the kindle fire edition, I'm not sure but I highly recogmend getting this game if you love horses.
B0058VW36U|5.0|my 6 year old loves it and so does my 3 year old easy concept they find it alot of fun good for on the road
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The story plot was great.  One note regarding the story is that a former Israeli official said that rescue was &#34;kid's stuff&#34; as Israel had itself rescued 33 of their own around the same period from their former diplomatic mission in Iran.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|very good love story and very r e a l i s t i c i could so see this happening
B00AATFJK2|4.0|Westworld<br />Where robot man and wome  ......<br /><br />wome ????<br /><br />Hope they caught it,  before it ships.<br /><br />Looking forward to watching it again, wish it had some extras!
B0015AARJI|3.0|Good product. After two months of use, the buttons on the right side did not work. I had to open it and clean it. Since then it has worked well.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I use this on all my laptops and tablets. Excellent app and almost runs itself. Recommend to anyone with tablet
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is pretty cool being I'm a huge horse lover but my only<br />complaint is it takes to long to finish the missions cause the health and love meters drop so easily
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an enjoyable read. I loved the telling of the story from the perspective of both characters which at times was very conflicting to each other (in the beginning) but isn't that how relationships are sometimes? The same story, just seen in very different lights? Also, I found myself able to relate and sympathize with both characters on some level or another. Definitely worth the read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of the bingo games that I play everyday. I like playing all bingo games but this one especially.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Great Film.  A tough topic taken on with intelligence and skill.  The directing, the acting, the interactions are all wonderful.  No complaints at all.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|set comes with double sided DVDs, blue ray and digital copies. Great series but I would recommend reading the books first. You will get more out of both if you do.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and addictive app to play you won't want to ever put it down I have been playing for over a month and still  love it
B008NW67E0|5.0|i much prefer this over their first cd. more enjoyable. got that deluxe version with dvd. who package was nicely done and music was very amusing.
0920668372|5.0|Every Mother, Grandmother needs to have one of these.  And to find a recording of Nellie Edge putting the story to song.  ALWAYS brings tears to my eyes.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|A really original and fun app for a great price. You can tell the team that created this game put a lot of hard work in. The topic seems morbid, but the game keeps a sense of humor. I would highly recommend this app.
0446677450|5.0|Definitly gives you a different outlook on money, why and how one views the love or use of Money a must have
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Well first of  all I reading but when it comes to the diary of a wimpy kid book I can't stop. I think it was a great book over all  and I can't wait for more<br /><br />btw this is coming from a 13 year old boy
B005K01VZS|5.0|This book had a little bit of everything in it! While a lot was based around faith and religion, it is by no means only a book for people who religiously attend temple, church, etc. I think everyone can relate to his writing in some way another, and I would recommend it!
0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed how the book kept up the suspense.  I will continue to read the rest of the series...
B0001HLVS2|4.0|This is a great movie. It seems the men in my house are in love with it. Great story and cinematics.
B00APJLFEG|1.0|I do not have this problem with Netflix and thought I would give Amazon another shot for a few movies. The stream quality, quite frankly, sucks. I will let the movie buffer for a good while and come back to watch it. I can never seem to watch it all the way through without it pausing and buffering. It ruins the quality of the movie, interjecting with the experience. This will be my review for all 3 movies I rented that evening.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Dickens is a great writer, and what struck me was the pace and his language while re-reading this classic.  Truly the stuff of a master of the English language.  The story, of course, remains relevant despite being 150 years old.  Timeless in its own way.
B00459EZLW|5.0|I'm a long time Stargate fan, and as any Stargate fan knows, Stargate Universe (SGU) is the series that killed the entire Stargate Franchise. The first season was plagued with poor pacing, bad writing and a whole lot of nothing happening.  The second season was vastly superior, containing some of the most interesting twists, plots and stories in any series I've ever seen.  It's well written and well pace, and it is very unfortunate that this series will never be continued.  While I was sorely disappointed with the first season, the second season made the whole series worth watching.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I bought this movie as a gift for my dad for Christmas. It's not my thing but he likes it. Very timely on the shipping and he really enjoys it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|There are so many reviews here I will keep this brief. I took to the main character quickly after reading the first few pages of this book. This is an intelligently mapped out story of a grounded character with great integrity and depth amidst a world of barbarianism and layers of sophisticated intrigue. The story is unpredictable and never lags. Whether an event, a revelation, a plot twist, a new character, or intense action ...something awaits as another levels off. The author manages to cover a lot of ground where other authors might have been tedious driving a point across. This is a fine introduction to a series I will be looking forward to.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I have been a fan always. The music is still as wonderful as when I was a teenager.Will be a favorite of mine forever
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series started to pick up steam and got very good during season 2.  Look forward to seeing the third season
B005HSL626|3.0|There needs to be bigger scoring. Also more time so you can acheive a bigger score.<br />So this game is ok.
1881273156|5.0|I consider this book a must read for anyone in a relationship...should be manditory!  Not only did it help me understand my relationship, but also my parents relationship.  I've really put this to use and regret that I passed it on to someone else because I would love to read it again.  I'm sure I would find things that I missed the first time.  This is one of those books that will never go out of style and always be revelent.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I feel that this app is okay considering at different levels you have to purchase other weapons to help you win that level.
1401232590|5.0|The item was in great shape and was an amazing value. I am very happy and would recommend this to anyone interested.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD and tried to find a way to download the NIV, so I do not have to be on the internet to use it. It's impossible. It would be nice to stay off the internet but cannot. I am deleting this app. You get what you pay for, and this app is definitely useless.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well i watched the movie 4 times and the book is better i think<br /><br />Thats what i think,<br />Sidney marie
B0094K1MH2|4.0|A little violent for the younger ones but action packed for the grade schoolers.  An overall fun movie to watch.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Very fun game hours of entertainment.  Great buy.  You will not be dissapointed with this 3d mahjong twist.  Keeps you entertained
B008AS5UAO|5.0|I have several \\"canonical\\" recordings of Mozart's magnificent opera that was singly responsible for the art's progress, as well as several outliers.  Over the years, I discerned one common trend - I seem to prefer darker-voiced Dons.  Cesare Siepi, Nicolai Ghiaurov, and Bryn Terfel sound larger-than-life on record.  And that's what the Don should be, in my opinion, - an all-conquering force of darkly-suave seduction, ostentatious show, and even menace.  Ilderbrando D'Arcangelo is just that - his voice is huge and dark-hued.  In fact, I'm puzzled as to why he's called bass-baritone. He sounds like a bona-fide bass, in fact I seem to recall that early in his career he sang Monterone in Rigoletto.  What a fun Mephistopheles he would make, btw!  This Don is indeed devilishly appealing.  Plus he even looks like a Don Juan of yore - a dashing gentleman with raven-black locks and fiery gaze.  Women, beware :)<br /><br />But D'Arcangelo isn't the only draw of this recording (I have to mention, this is a concert-recording, but it sounds blessedly free of coughs, shuffles, and other audience noises, safe for a couple of giggles.  In fact, the recording is spacious and rich, DG engineers hold to their standards).  Let's start with the tenor - after all, he's the only formidable opponent, aside from supernatural forces, to the Don.  I can't begin to count how many recordings have a wimpy don Ottavio.  They so often sound like timid choir-boys, capable of nothing but florid passages.  Not so with Rolando Villazon.  He's indeed back in the top form to sing a very compelling and strong Ottavio.  Aside from Francisco Araiza, he's the only tenor on record who displays a, so-to-speak, alternative masculinity to Don Giovanni himself. Villazon drops the intensity and gets \\"lyrical\\" only in the finale.<br /><br />Now for the leading ladies - they're luxuriously cast.  If anyone had any doubts that DG didn't just tape a concert performance, but purposely invited top-shelf talent for this recording, consider: Diana Damrau as Donna Anna and Joyce DiDonato as Donna Elvira.  The only comparison I could recall is Giulini's celebrated set that has both Joan Sutherland and Elizabeth Schwarkopf, but this one still is better because here the two female voices could not be more different.  Both are well-regarded as technical experts.  I recently reviewed DiDonato's Rossini album, it's truly a wonder to listen to. Damrau, of course, is the leading Mozart soprano of today.  She recorded two (!) albums with Jeremie Rhorer focused on Mozartean material and stunned the operagoers as a magnificent Queen of the Night (which makes her outing as dramatic-soprano Donna Anna only more impressive). They're both in their element here - completely at ease with Mozart's demanding score and complicated recitatives.  They also bring very different characters to life.  In fact, they're somewhat different than the canonical interpretations.  For one, they're both very strong - it would indeed take a devil of a Don Giovanni to mess with such personalities.<br /><br />Last but not least by any means - the excellent Luca Pisaroni.  I first encountered him on a youtube video as Don Basilio - he sang the Slander aria in a concert setting.  A very impressive bass-baritone (now, by contrast with D'Arcangelo, the emphasis is on baritone, it's much lighter-colored than the former's) with an uncanny comical gift.  But he also sang a spine-chilling Caliban - this is one very versatile artist and a major talent to keep watching.  His banter with Don Giovanni is masterfully done, and their voices differ so much, it's impossible to be confused, as it easily could've become with two voices of virtually the same fach.<br />Mojca Erdmann and Konstantin Wolff make an excellent Zerlina and Mazetto. And Russian bass Votalij Kowaljow has a somewhat husky booming sound perfect for Il Commendatore (although D'Arcangelo's resonance is somehow even more stunning by comparison).<br /><br />I haven't heard of Yannick N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin before.  I must admit, his handling of the famous Overture made me a little nervous at first.  In fact, it's markedly different from orchestral showpiece treatment I was used to (Karajan, Giulini, Solti). But then things improved, the pace was brisk and energetic; some emphases are even over-stated, which is probably a good thing. The sound of the Mahler Chamber (?) Orchestra is warm and rich, particularly the low strings and winds.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is the Don to treasure.  I have no doubts it will achieve a classic status in no time, and it's completely deserving of all the hype that DG expanded prior to its release.  I'm fully aware that Don Giovanni is one of the few operas that have a myriad of followers/aficionados, and each has their unshakable standards and favourites.  It will be next to impossible to convince them to give a \\"modern\\" recording a chance.  At the same time, this lovely version is not to be missed by anyone who views opera as an ever-evolving art, open to new interpretations and treatments (that don't ruin the composer's intentions, naturally) and featuring the leading singers of modern era.  Finally, a word about packaging.  The case is slim, unlike the 2-inch wide slip-cases of the 90's.  Upon receiving it, I was almost expecting having to search for a downloadable pdf libretto.  Luckily, this turned out not to be the case - DG provides a full \\"traditional\\" libretto in 4 languages.  It's just that the 3 CDs are packaged in rather flimsy carton sleeves, and that allows for keeping the case's width at ~¾ of an inch.  Frankly, I don't know why this is necessary given the full price of the set, but hey, I can live with it.  Aside from this small quibble, I'll undoubtedly reach (just very carefully) for this recording when in the mood to hear some gorgeous music-making.ard of Yannick N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin before.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This psychological study of a sociopath and her husband is an interesting read. It is also an interesting study in marriage, and human relationships as well. This book certainly held my interest!
B00BHMF578|3.0|Overrated like most Oscar nominations are. Good story boring movie. A few suspenseful moments and thats it. It was okay.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Maybe not historically accurate , but entertaining. Casting was good, location beautiful. Those really involved tell a slightly different story.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We had been wanting to see this for quite awhile and it kept us riveted.  Very good film. Deserving of all awards received.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I had it for 2 year without problem. However, when I loaded it up with my Canon I Dx, 3 L lenses including 70-200mm, back strap seam started to come off. Otherwise, it is a really good economical back pack that does not look like a camera bag if you not carry a tripod or monopod and if you do not carry heavy equipment in it.
B001AG52AG|5.0|good, but if you want my review don't make it so hard.  I'll give you the stars only next time or not at all!
B005IQZB14|3.0|As a hiker in my younger days, this is something I never would have done.  Actually, most of my hiking has been Sunday outings or with hiking clubs.  This book was a little too blow by blow and not holding my interest for long periods of time.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great app. This is probably my most used app. It gets me on my network, has music and video players and let's me manage both local and network files.

B0007TKNII|5.0|The closed captions make this DVD a fab experience.  The lyrics to this English opera are superb and with Webber's music, this DVD is a treat to be seen more than once.  Rating it all, it is definitely a five in all categories.  The theater, the stage, the cast.  By the way all singing was done by the main characters except for Mimi Driver.  But she too is a trained soprano and did an admirable job.  This is an old and maybe considered a little &#34;tattered and torn&#34; musical, but the tunes are haunting and beautiful.  The main character young and impressionable.  The voice of the Phantom is one we should hear more often.  Not completely perfect, but strong and perfect for the part.  Christine's voice is proven at a young age.  All did a superb job and I watch this DVD once or so a month for the fabulous music. Worth a try.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Great album!  Having only just heard any of their music before buying this album, I was blown away by this band.  Great vocals, great music, great lyrics.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|this game is great but to many popups and it sucked because you don't have a checking account of your own.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is clearly some of Coppola's best work & it ages very well. It had been so long since I'd seen these movies that it was refreshing to see them back to back without commercial interruptions.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Being a huge pop music fan, this isn't just my favorite album of Britney's, but of all-time. I just feel it's so creative and perfect. \\"In the Zone,\\" unfortunately seems to get ignored a lot of the time, and the mediocre \\"Blackout\\" seems to get all the praise, or \\"Circus\\" seems to get the attention for being her \\"big comeback.\\" But, \\"In the Zone\\" IS the perfect pop album. The sound of the album is completely different from the sound of her three previous albums prior to this one; which is intriguing because the sound of \\"In the Zone\\" doesn't seem to follow the mainstream music or other pop music of the time it was written, recorded, and released. This makes the album stand out a lot compared to everything else, and makes it truly a pop music masterpiece (Britney also has writing credits on 3/4 of the album's tracks). \\"In the Zone\\" contains beautifully written and emotionally-charged ballads (\\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\"), bubblegum pop mixed with ambient elements (\\"Brave New Girl\\"), experimental pop (\\"Showdown,\\" \\"Toxic,\\" and \\"Touch of My Hand\\"), more urban pop (\\"Me Against the Music,\\" \\"(I Got That)Boom Boom,\\"), house-influenced tracks (\\"Breathe On Me,\\" \\"Early Mornin'\\"), and pop music with exotic elements (\\"Outrageous,\\" and \\"The Hook Up\\"). Everything is extremely well-produced, written, and sung. Perhaps the album is just too overwhelming and left of the middle to some listeners and fans of the other three albums that preceded \\"In the Zone,\\" but any pop music fanatic will adore it. The album's front and back covers, album booklet, music videos, and imagery were all thought-out and executed brilliantly. Pop music at its zenith, without a doubt.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Good story - journey -- and there is a thoughtfulness and depth to it.  Good book to reflect on.
B0063IH60K|3.0|She likes any game on the internet and so do our twin grandsons.  I'm not a game person except Scrabble
B009MO5E10|3.0|This was a &#34;cute&#34; movie trying to be serious. That's my take on it. You have too much lighthearted to take it seriously. Even the cop, and no I won't spoil it, wasn't that believable. I was actually distracted while trying to watch it. It was fast paced, but in such a way I had a hard time keeping focused on it. Predictable ending. It was okay, but not something I would want to watch again.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Really good. Very intense. I was expecting more of an action / investigative thriller, and while it had components of that, it was largely about alcohol addiction. They did a great job of portraying that addiction. Denzel is always great.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|This movie exceeds that shown in Baraka. The quality of the images and the music composed by Lisa Gerrard transport viewers to magical places captured by Ron Fricke.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|This series never really came alive for me. One of a small handful of sympathetic character got killed in the end in a similar way that Meg Ryan got killed in the City of Angels. What was the point?
B001CDLATE|5.0|Everytime I have watched this movie is like the first time. But, the quality reached by the blu ray system is amazing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A friend raved about &#34;The Book Thief&#34; so I decided to read it myself. I was quite surprised to see that it was part of &#34;Random House Children's Books,&#34; as the material is quite harsh in parts. However, I feel that my 15-year-old granddaughter would be able to assimilate its lessons on &#34;man's inhumanity to man&#34; as well as enjoy a good read. Most books present the facts from the point of view of the Jewish victims of the Nazis in WWII, but this quirky, compelling book gives voice to the suffering of Germans who did not agree with Nazism and were persecuted as well. (As a person of 3/4 German heritage, I appreciated this viewpoint. Not all Germans were &#34;bad people&#34; in WWII.) This book will help to keep the knowledge of the Holocaust alive in the next generation.

0441172717|4.0|I ordered this book because it was highly ranked in the must-read Sci-Fi category, however it did take me awhile to get into it. My main difficulty was understanding some of the language in the book, given that it's set in the future I didn't understand the meaning behind some words thus it made it harder to follow. Anyhow, after I did some research online to understand some of the words I got really into it and now I am very happy I stayed with it.

B0095VPAVE|4.0|AMD's APU, short for accelerated processing unit, is a combination of desktop-class CPU and discrete-class GPU in a single chip. This approach allows for greater integration and brings forth a new class of computing platform with a phenomenal price-to-performance ratio. The A8-5600K is AMD's upper-range APU, featuring a \\"quad-core\\" CPU and Radeon 7560D GPU. The CPU portion of the A8-5600K is more or less on par with the [[ASIN:B0093H8H8I Intel Core i3-3225]], but graphics portion is nearly twice as fast as the top-end Intel HD4000. (As of this writing the i3-3225 costs ~ $35 more than the A8-5600K)<br /><br />The A8-5600K can handle all common computing workloads including web browsing with dozens of open tabs, playing facebook games, watching streaming HD video, Microsoft Office and other productivity software, etc. It even supports playing modern 3D games with acceptable frame rates using low to medium settings and older games with the settings turned up. While the APU won't win any benchmark contests, it offers an unbeatable value for day-to-day general-purpose computing.<br /><br />I built a computer around the A8-5600K for my grandparents and before giving it to them, I put this chip through its paces. My grandparents don't need a powerful GPU, which is the primary reason why I did not step up to the more powerful A10-5800K, and I did not go with a lower-spec APU since I use this computer from time to time and I enjoy the occasional casual game in the company of family.  So far, nobody misses the old Pentium D 805 with nVidia GeForce 8400gs that was replaced!<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed by the A8-5600K and I enjoyed my time with it. I installed Hitman: Sniper Challenge and [[ASIN:B005XOJ6NK Sonic Generations]] and tried playing them on a TV at 720P. The games were very playable even at medium settings! Of course, I could not leave well enough alone and I set off to overclock the graphics side to see how much more performance I could squeeze out.

B007712XAU|5.0|DVDs arrived on schedule in great shape in new packaging, worked in DVD player well.  I used the subtitle option to help with a few British words, accents and pronunciations I wasn't familiar with and was very glad I did.  There's some behind-the-scenes stuff on the Season 1 DVD that's very interesting.  Seller was prompt and professional.  Would purchase from seller again without reservation.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love it! It is as good as the movie! Hope there are more good books like this! One of collections!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This is gonna be a great way to organize my thoughts. I like this app over other diary apps. The covers are good too.
B001WCN1SS|5.0|Treat yourself and get this album on vinyl!  Just putting it on the record player is relaxing. Rodriquez's voice, lyrics and guitar melodies are soulful, smart and stay with you throughout the day.  Get it and enjoy.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Dan Pink offers great insight into how the world of selling (and influencing) has changed in this age of incredible amounts of information. His observations and conclusions are valuable to anyone who works with or for people.  And like his book &#34;Drive&#34;, don't expect the obvious answer to be the best.  It's an enjoyable, informative read that you'll find yourself quoting,
B001BKVWYQ|5.0|After seeing the documentary Searching for Sugar Man, I knew I had to get his music on vinyl.  The album came (though shipping took longer than stated) and it is just as amazing as the music I heard throughout the movie.  Rodriguez's soulful lyrics and melodies are just amazing.  Best album I've purchased in a long, long time.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|The biggest problem with this movie is that you must have seen the first in the series, Casino Royale, in order to make any sense out of this. Quantum of Solace really is just a continuation of that film in many ways. Secondly, the movie moves so quickly that the plot is impossible to follow. You never get to learn anything about the characters.  They could have done so much more with this movie.  The movie finally slows down when Bond reaches Bolivia, but much remains unexplained and unresolved. You never really learn what the secret organization is or who is running it. They are powerful enough to try to kill M, but after Bond kills the man responsible for the death of his lover everyone seems satisfied to let it go.  Great job of counter-intelligence, MI-6... NOT!  I actually think this is the weakest of all the Bond films, and I give it 2.5 stars.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Awesome show, great streaming -- no interruptions, slow downs.<br /><br />:) Highly recommend - can't wait for S3 to be available!
B00992CF6W|5.0|grandson plays this when he comes to stay with me. love to send long periods of time on it. Great to keep him quiet while his sister sleops or grandpa watches t.v.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I love this show.  Amazon makes it very easy to catch up on missed episodes.  I'll be watching many more.
B003AJVXZO|5.0|The video has a great storyline of law enforcement in the future with breaking edge technology.  Gives a new view to the cyberworld.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story is exciting and sweet and possibly one of the saddest stories with so much love it's incredible the things you will go through for the ones  you love
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!  I could hardly put it down. The characters were very relate able  I felt like I was there. And the way she dealt with so many issues, it just fit.
159562015X|5.0|I found the result insightful and encouraging.  What was most helpful was the the line up of the various strengths within the circle to see how complimentary there were.  It was also helpful to notice what were my weaknesses although they were no apparent in the diagram.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A superb cast tells a true story of love.  This movie is a sleeper of 2012.  It is beautiful beyond words and touches your inner being,
B0060CREHO|5.0|One of my favorites as a child, who couldn't love Dumbo? Couldn't pass up the chance to own it for myself!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A solid good entertaining movie!!!!!!!!! It made me think,, could something like this happen.....a possibility.......Denzel acting skills shine in this movie.  I wish he would take on more interesting stories like this in the future, as he shines in this role.
B0060CXSR4|5.0|Yes, I know it's not totally accurate, but I am not watching a Disney movie for a history lesson. It's a beautiful and dramatic story, and a must own for disney lovers!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The characters are fantastic and great action that never ends.  Nothing else to compare to it except Season one that was also unbelievable.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Loved the movie. Quality on my iPad was wonderful. Priced high at $14.99 but needed to watch it before part 2 came out.  Wish prices were cheaper but for the quality I am very pleased.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Loved the series on HBO so I had to have it to watch over and over.  The Mother of Dragons is awesome.  Lots of characters to keep up with so if you are confused go to the web site and look at the family trees.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun to play and it is addictive. If you ever get bored or have nothing better to do then you should try Subway Surfers out! Just download it and believe me you will not regret it one bit.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Awesome book....much to think about....Mr Dawkins may not get the results he wishes but then again maybe we already had it figured out .....the author may have gone over a limit in some subjects
0316023744|5.0|An extensively researched account of a necessary war. He brings to light the characters of many of the chief participants who were responsible for conducting the Allied forces. I was in Italy as a humble air crew for much of the Italian campagne and the account rings true.
B000FC2ROU|5.0|Enjoyed KAFKA ON THE SHORE.....Murakami characters are each supreme and the interaction between Kafka and each person gives much insight....entering different philosophers and writers over a long period of time gives much to the story.....good reading
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My first Stephen King book. WOW! A mixture of history, love, and a story of pure adventure! Rich in detail and everything I was hoping for plus more. King has kept me up at night, which no other man has done since my husband married me 4 years ago. Great story.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|We saw Skyfall on DVD Saturday night. I have some issues with the story, still it was the best Bond film I've seen in ages.  It confirmed for me that Daniel Craig is the best actor to play Mr. Bond since my favorite, Sean Connery. The film was loaded with action like most Bond films.  It also contained some interesting back stories on Bond's roots and that for some of the other characters.  If it had ended better I would have liked it even more.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************<br /><br />Warning - stop now if you have not seen the film.  Spoilers are coming<br /><br />*******************************************************************************<br /><br />I didn't like how the white slave girl was killed during the target pistol challenge to Bond.  Bond makes his move to fight right after she's shot instead of before in order to save her.  It should have been written differently. He had more or less given her hope he would save her on the boat.  The Bonds of the past films would have done more for her.  This Bond hardly seemed fazed by her impending death.<br /><br />The villain was played very well.  You could even understand his hatred for M.  Problem is that his escape from the cell and the way he played Bond's agency made them all look like total knuckleheads.  Would it have hurt to put a good padlock on his cell in addition to electronic doors?  They knew their systems had already been compromised once.<br /><br />I thought the way it ended with Judi Dench's M dying was a mistake too.  I know they were going for the emotional impact.  Maybe it was how she paid for the lives of the agents she'd sacrificed.  She was even willing to write off Bond if it meant saving more agents. Now it was her turn. The problem for me was Bond had spent the last part of the film doing everything in his power to save her life.  He even totally destroyed his ancestral home. And worst of all the classic Aston Martin from Goldfinger.  It was so nice to see the car back, then they totally destroy it.  It was so silly that M escaped onto the moors through a hidden passage only to then start walking with a bright flashlight.  In the dark that flashlight showed exactly where she was to her pursuers. She might as well have sent up a flare !  Then she hides in the only other building left standing.  If they had simply hidden on the moors in the dark with the flashlight out they never would have been found.  Also, there should have been an army there to help protect her after the attack.  Instead she has only Bond.  If they were using this as a way to show that Bond still had what it takes to be the best, they should not have made all his efforts to save her be in vain.  The ending I would have preferred was her retiring.  Maybe even hinting that she was going to have some sort of relationship with that grounds keeper and retire to a simple life for her final years.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't  sure how I would like this book, I knew that I loved the movie but would I love the book, and my answer is YES! They might say it's a younger persons book but I'm 60 and I enjoyed every page,from beginng to end. I can't wait for the next!  I was lucky enough to have Amazon Prime, which I also highly recommend and I'm not a employee, so I got it and  next two for free and can't wait for the next two. Happy  Reading
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It helps me keep track of my bids and totally helps me win a lot. Love love love this app! Highly recommended!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have enjoyed watching Downton Abbey very much, just as many others are reported to also be doing.  I enjoy the writing, some of the lines of Judy Dench are hilarious!  I learned that some of the story is true, even though there was much literary license taken with the story.  Anyway, I find it quite interesting to peek into the window of the aristocracy of the English.<br />The costumes and grandeur of the scenes are a treat to watch.  Kudos to those who made all of this come alive.<br />I also enjoy seeing the relationships between the aristocracy and the help.<br />All in all, I very much enjoy the series.  Even though some of the characters have died, (so sad), that is all part of the story.  Looking forward to next season.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman is amazing in it's simplicity and accuracy in the ways that each person receives and gives love.  It helps me to watch for better ways to love those around me.  I am glad I read it.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This was one of the best movies iv ever seen! It's gives you a sense that life is worth it, and that it doesn't matter how far down you've been in life because life can always get better.
B005LAII12|5.0|This unrated version was just that! Not very enlightening for those who don't like to hear cuss words every other...funny movie and wouldn't recommend it for young children.
B008LFY6NI|1.0|OPENS FOR ABOUT 1 SECOND THEN CLOSES DOWN, EVERY TIME, TRIED ABOUT 25 TIMES, TIRED OF IT, DOESN'T WORK ON GOOGLE NEXUS 7,

B0066WJLU6|5.0|I added this great app for it's use as a flashlight and as a bonus I got a great light source for viewing Photo Slides, and Negatives. As an avid Estate Sale - Garage sale &#34;Junkie&#34; I Love to find great photo's, and this light helps me do that as Both a Light source in dark garages / storage spaces, but perfect as a light table to view slides & photo negatives. a &#34;win-win&#34; on my Kindle!
1587613379|5.0|My luv and I bought this book and have been reading it together. I feel like it's reading our minds sometimes! I recommend this for anyone interested, even a little, in free love/poly relationships.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|The singing is spot on. The band is tight. Music as it should be.<br />Although some of Frank's jokes fall flat 50+ years later, the music is timeless.
B0036G1T78|1.0|The movie plot was almost unrelated to the book. Of course, the plot had to be shortened for the movie, but shortening is not the same as changing. The book told a good story. Why change it?
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Were these guys born with instruments in their hands? They play one show and totally rock. I prefer this to Song Remains The Same.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. I would recommend everyone one check it out at least once. I even got mu sister hooked. She had to go back an watch every episode. I have recently started reading the graphic novels.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so fun I cant stop playing it. people say that I'm a temple run 2 addict and I say I know. any one who doesn't. like it needs to see a doctor
B009YX02T8|3.0|I was a fan of the first and second soundtracks. Eclipse and Breaking Dawn disappointed me. On his soundtrack, 'Fire on the Water' by Feist is my favorite song with 'All I've ever Needed' by Paul McDonald & Nikki Reed close behind.
B001684L0A|5.0|Bought this for my Sister for Christmas, she had watched it when it was on HBO & then again last year on Memorial Day *I think *<br />so bought the Blu-ray copy for her..<br />She was thrilled!!!!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth are amazing actors and there were some spectacular special effects. None of this was enough to save he weak story and awful acting by Kristen Stewart.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its really good because it makes my life easier. Like Diy,  makeup, fashion, anything you name it. I just design my room and it only cost $5. Follow me Maria. @mariaitis
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing story! I'm already on the second one; once you start reading you seriously won't be able to put it down! It's also obviously much better than the movie version...
B00908DDZM|5.0|I had the op to get a demo of this CD a while back and it caused me to buy the whole CD when it came out<br />Its a breath of fresh air.<br />Thrift Shop is what draws people in and then the rest of the CD is where the substance is.<br />I can't say enough good things about the CD other then I can put it on and let it run track through track w/o wanting to hit the next button.
030759565X|5.0|Deb Perelman is a great author, I have been reading her blog and I just love how she cooks. She tries to use simple ingredients that everyone would have on hand, and she's done all the hard work of testing out the recipe for you. I also think she has great range in this book. Overal, great buy! I did purchase it for a friend, but I hope to have one of my own on the shelf someday (though I've borrowed a copy from the library right now).
0316056863|2.0|Tina fey is a very funny comedian, but I felt like she wrote this book simply because other comedians like Chelsea handler have written fantastic memoirs. If you're not that crazy a And haven't lived a crazy life it's probably not worth writing a book about. I still have an appreciation for her comedic work but wouldn't buy another book of hers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great deal of fun and will keep you entertained for hours. I do not usually play games like this but the graphics are well done and it is a enjoyable challenge trying to complete each mission.
1439153663|5.0|I'm a quarter way through this book and it is so engaging. It's been ages since I found a book that I want to read all the time. Highly recommended.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This Blu-Ray DVD is a Must have for your collection.. The Best Batman Series Yet!! Christian Bale did a heck of a job putting it together.. Includes a mini booklet for a quick summary of the series & the design of the cover is Unique..
0142419850|5.0|Amazon did a great job delivering this. My ten year old is cruising through this series. We read it at night, both my husband and I don't want to stop at the chapter's end,  It is fantastic!!!!
B0041KXY5S|5.0|Although the cover is in Italian, the movie itself is the original in Japanese/English with a variety of subtitles.<br />As someone who's previously enjoyed the movie, watching the making-of documentary found on the second disc was very much entertaining.<br /><br />The only thing that I think could have been done better was making sure the parcel was a bit more secure. It arrived to my destination (Australia) with no issues, but it wasn't exactly posted for something as fragile as a disc.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Was on the edge of my seat for two hours. I'd certainly watch this again. There was great acting and a great story.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Th thrill of hustling by the law keeps your attention vivid throughout the film. Great movie that inspires thinking in your feet and by the end, doing things right.
B0018RC7QE|3.0|Great to see great actors. Film feels very dates. Story is ok. Seems realistic but awkward to watch at times.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles. I love this app. puzzles are good for the soul. I like the background music and the amount of pieces options.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|It's simple and easy to use.  I can track my purchases.  It is everything I enjoy about shopping with amazon, but now it's on my phone/tablet.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A great documentary giving us some insight to the man we all knew so very little about. I first got into Rodriguez's music &#34;Cold Fact&#34; on a bus tour through Europe in 1979 and was immediately captivated. A very moving story about a humble man, a brilliant musician, songwriter who somehow slipped through the fingers of promoters etc, and never became as well known or as big as he deserves.<br />Absolutely love it
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I like the premise of the show.  I did not watch the show when it was originaly on tv.  A crime.  I did not discover the show till i watched serenity.  Both are good.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Don't like the way Dean is always to mean, with his double standards towards his brother, however.  Need to modify his personality so he's more of a team player.  Not so self-absorbed.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Was instantly into this show! Looking forward to many more shows and seasons! A + + + + + +
B00BHU261S|4.0|Anthony Hopkins perhaps plays on his prior roles as Hannibal Lechter to make himself believable as a Hitchcock haunted by the main character in Psycho. Helen Mirren plays a very believable Alma Reville, a frustrated and very talented wife who has played a substantial role in Hitchcock's career but has had to suppress her role.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I love puzzle games and this game is fun, but I wish there were more levels to play in the puzzle mode
B000SJJCX4|5.0|Works great! Yeah its plastic, but its not going to break when you stand on it. I don't see any reason this pedal shouldn't last a long time as long as your good to it. I put it on my pedal board and that's where it will stay. If you don't have a pedal board with a case, or you really abuse your pedals then this probably isn't for you. I'm extremely happy with it though and it tunes great!
B004IFGORQ|3.0|Funny movie, my five year old grandson loved it. The ten year old got a little bored but sat through till the end.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I was really disappointed with this item. Most of the reviews were positive but I just don't find it very effective at all. I think I'll stick with my wet stone.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|My wife actually wanted to purchase this movie, and I thought, &#34;this is going to be a stupid movie&#34;.  Boy was I wrong!  Very very funny movie, not for kids, but very funny.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Wonderful book.  Nicholas is a wonderfuf author and I love his books.  Recommend o other readers.  A must read book.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|If you like gorry and gruesome movies with a to die for story line then this is definately your movie!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow is very fun but can be pretty easy. I usually play it when I have three minutes to pass or something. It's a fun game and I would get it if I were you, but there are lots of other great games I have that I would play before this for 10+ minutes.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great to be able to have my Facebook Friends with me on the go, I just can't take the laptop everywhere.... soooo easy to take along.
B005HSL626|4.0|We got this after doing it on a XBOX Kinnect.  I like it better on the Kinnect as we feel we get somewhat of a workout on it.  My 8 year old likes it but also said she liked doing the Kinnect a little better.  But a free game ALWAYS works for us!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love to be able to see my weather as it's happening. Also the fact I can list other places, such as friends & family areas to keep an eye on what's happening there.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is.so.amazig. it really made me look at life differently. Charlie is such a sweet, and careing boy. Love it!!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Great... action... thought provoking.  Didn't know how they would top the previous MIB.<br />We really enjoyed it in our house.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Different than I expected, good read nonetheless. A little too deep for me, as I was looking for a simple, happy book.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Need more brainiac shows... great casting!<br />Great writing/topics which makes it interesting and updated in today's world.<br />Good realistic approach to recovery too.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I loved Season 1 & 2. Very well written show. I'm addicted :) can't wait to watch season 3!!! I would recommend buying this set to anyone!
B001GCUER0|5.0|We love Mad Men..collecting all seasons.  The cast is awesome, especially Jon Hamm. Looking forward to more seasons to come.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read. I cried at the end and didn't want it to end. I highly recommend this book, you won't regret reading it.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|IT HELPS YOU WITH YOUR WORK AND THE OTHER STUFF LIKE WODSS YOU NEED AND LEARN MORE WORK ON YOUR PHONE NUMBER
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is however, nothing like the movie.  I read the book before seeing the film which was also wonderful but completely different than the book.  I would recommend reading the book even if you have seen the film.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|...in the last five minutes of this one. Of course you had to sit through the first two and just about the entirety of this one to get to it. I'm a bit concerned that Nolan is going to guide the DC universe. Do he and his brother ever talk over the logic of their plots with anyone else, someone who might be able to point out the many disjunctures?
B006LSZECO|5.0|one of those books that grab you from the first page.  Unique writing style...can't wait to read more of Flynn's novels!
B004QSQML8|4.0|If you love fairy tales, films like The Hobbit, fantasy, magic and Tom Cruise, this film must be in your collection. It includes two versions of the film. Spanish subtitles.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I had fun playing this game, it was a little challenging on certain floors. But over all, great fun and I would recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Yet another great book by Connelly. The twist here surprised me and I have read all his books. Look forward to the next one.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|As  WWIIi buff I think it is great book about aireal warfare and the people invalved in it is a GREAT read
B00004RF98|5.0|How can you go wrong with a classic, ordered and gotten in a timely fashion. Now I can watch it any day, come rain or shine,
0307277453|5.0|It's fascinating to see how we began to develop as fish, then amphibians, and finally mammals.  I wish my science teachers had been so clever at explaining things.
B004JMRDQE|5.0|If you like movies, like music, like mystery, like a good story, then you will like The Legend of 1900.  I love it, and the process to obtain it was likable as well.  Ordered for a good price, sent and received in a timely fashion.  Nothing to complain about at all.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|this was a fun game to play. just challenging enough to make it fun and not boring  G5 games dont disappoint
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This show is awesome. There is no show on television with a more believable cast, with a more sympathetic cast...one wants to believe these characters actually lived, succeeded, and ruled Fifth Avenue.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Yes... I loved this app. it is very addictive. I really want the unicorn. I like rainbows. I want another horsie.
B002KVZBGA|4.0|I had a hard time getting into the movie. The picture quality wasn't that great and I liked the new version better.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great to know exactly how much battery life you have in an instant. Very useful item that is definitely user friendly. I just love it.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I really like this program. Very useful and a time saver. I think it could be a good program for any one.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It can really pass the time during a major weather event or misunderstanding wit h your significant other or as a break from your daily routine.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I am a big fan of Nicholas Sparks and this is up there with one of his bests, I cant wait to see the movie.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|We watched this the week after it won the Academy Award, and while it was a good movie, it was below standards for the &#34;Best Movie&#34;.  We've seen two of the other nominees (Les Miserables and Silver Linings Playbook) and like both of them better.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|Together with Day One, by far the best book I've read in a long time.  Truly an epic work, extremely well developed subplots, I'm hoping the Chronicler will get stuck and have to stay a whole week :)
B0012PDVQ2|1.0|When I ordered this movie, I got a message that there was an error in procession the order.  I looked and did not see the purchase in my account.  So I went on to other things in my life.  More than 24 hours have passed before I noticed that it had in deed been purchased.  BUT NOW I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO WATCH IT!  PLEASE, AMAZON, REFUND MY MONEY FOR THIS MOVIE!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is super addicting. I play it all  the time. We all play it. We take turns competing the different levels. We also try to beat each others times.

055358202X|3.0|The 4th book in this series, is a little boring.<br />The 3rd book was a hard act to follow!<br />This one mostly deals with Theon Greyjoy's family and Dorne, with a bunch of Cersei and Jamie chapters.

B0006PV5U8|4.0|I believe the second movement theme in the Sibelius is one of the sweetest melodies ever written, and wanted to show it to my wife.  She loves it, but does not love the Prokofiev and likes (but does not love) the Glazunov.  I am more eclectic than she is.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Who knew this was a teen drama and yet another, gentler, attempt at copying the cheesy perfect male heart throbe from &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; but without the sado masochism!
0142421375|5.0|I always enjoy reading John Grisham. This trilogy is good. It's like one book in three sections. I recommend it.

0618001905|5.0|An excellent and engaging historical account of just one of the many instances of the horrors that wealthy nations have visited upon poor nations in pursuit of money and power, as well as one of the few instances where a public outcry in the wealthy nations actually arose in response--perhaps the first historical forerunner of today's movements to lessen such horrors.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very cute and funny movie. A great movie for kids. Adam Sandler could play any part to any movie. Awesome!
0199747431|4.0|In Friction: How Radicalization Happens to Them and Us, McCauley seeks to explain how terrorists are led to action through mechanisms that are based on emotions and experiences that are common to all humans: love, fear, personal grievance, etc. He claims that Americans could be led through the very same psychological processes to radicalize and indeed, at the end of the work, one is shocked at his or her ability to understand terrorists. If the work is so easy to read and its explanations broach common sense, why does it take 248 pages to explain?<br /><br />Terrorism is not actually something most of us are familiar with. For most Americans, their understanding of it is predicated on one event, one figurehead, and one non-state acting group.<br /><br />Domestic terrorism, however, is something we are even less familiar with. Examples date back to abolitionists like John Brown, but these historic figures are not typically referred to as \\"terrorists\\" in AP US History textbooks or classes. The last recorded instance of domestic terrorism in America would be the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma State. Personally, I would have been 3 years old.<br /><br />Mass murder, on the other hand, is something Americans are quite familiar with, especially given the rise and recency of school shootings: Columbine in 1999, Virginia Tech in 2007, and Sandy Hook in 2012. I was 18 when Senator Gabby Giffords and several of her constituents were shot in Tucson, AZ. I was 19 when viewers of the Dark Knight Rises were shot in Denver, CO. I was 20 when Sandy Hook Elementary school children and staffers were shot in Newton, CT. These instances are much more firm in my memory. All of them evade my understanding.<br /><br />Watching the news at night, we are shown the faces of those behind these events: Jared Lee Loughner, James Holmes, and Adam Lanza. We hear about the lack of humanity, the lack of remorse, and the lack of rage while they committed these actsor when they stand to trial. More important than the fact that they acted without apparent or disclosed reason, they acted with a lack of emotion: they must have been insane.<br /><br />So, McCauley's alternative explanation for terrorists' acts beyond political motivations isn't instinctive. Our reluctance to identify with terrorists is because we - albeit fortunately - are not familiar with it. We are not used to hearing about American radicals committing violence with some sort of psychological explanation for their acts or rational end in mind. If we liken terrorists to ourselves at all, we liken them to mass murderers, radicals who are most often understood as insane. If an oppressive political structure or coercive regime in power is not the reason for acts of violence, then the actors behind them, to our best guesses, must also be insane.<br /><br />McCauley's work explains well how this is not the case. If there is one criticism to be had, the book is wanting of examples of domestic terrorists that are seen as heroes today - not just humanitarians in Haiti - or examples of radicals who actually act violently in America for those reasons McCauley claims. In their absence, terrorism is still a \\"foreign\\" phenomenon. If modern examples are few, perhaps the reader is due a more cross-cultural explanation or historical analysis on why radicals in America express opinions and would incite violence, but frequently don't. These addendums may be unimportant to the very original point McCauley makes: radicalization is understandable. But it is important to what I think the book is meant to do. Once we better understand why we have a tough time likening terrorists to ourselves, we actually will change how we respond to them and appropriately capitalize on the mistakes of terrorists who anticipate the former enraged responses we will no longer grant. I hope to see McCauley step up to the task.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Great action, great story. I hope they make a series out of it. Would love to see how they could implement the other numbers.
B00846REIS|2.0|i did not like the language.. i thought it was very vulgar (compared to erotic)..also i didn't think the story was sophisticated as i expected.
1449325947|5.0|to learn the style sheet language. And the author, David Sawyer McFarland, is an excellent teacher who sticks around for the long haul, meaning that with so many advances, changes and new directions taking place relative to the markup language HTML (now HTML5) and the style sheet language CSS (now CSS2.1 and CSS3), it is important to follow a series to keep up with the latest improvements. And that is what Professor McFarland provides.<br /><br />I had just begun to study his book, CSS, when I learned that this new book had been released so, upon acquiring it, I could read about the many changes while comparing the two editions, and they are plentiful.<br /><br />The author's method of teaching is very good for beginners like myself who have pretty well mastered HTML and want to apply the design functions of CSS. The book contains excellent tutorials and the author's manner of writing is clear, easy to understand and thorough. It is divided into five parts, the last one containing appendixes.<br /><br />Some prior knowledge of HTML is suggested; as for CSS3, Part One covers the basics, and the reader can follow along from there.<br /><br />The author recommends that the HTML5 doctype be implemented (so one will learn a lot about this updated markup language throughout the book) although Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions don't recognize the HTML5 tags. In order to apply CSS, using the HTML5 doctype, to these earlier versions of Internet Explorer, the author provides some JavaScript to employ in order to solve the problem. He does not include XHTML as it is not evolving as was expected when it was introduced in 2000.<br /><br />Besides CSS Basics and the Appendixes, the other three parts of the book are: Applied CSS, CSS Page Layout and Advanced CSS. I cannot imagine any book more helpful, especially for beginners like myself, and I am very glad to be studying it which will probably be for a long time until another updated book is published.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i think that it is fun it is not like any other game and i think it is unique but when ypu bought a game you cant beat and you dont have enough points to buy any more is a problem

B009OYSFDM|5.0|This program was a complete surprise to me. It was an survival adventure. It was Batman. It was the Green Hornet. It was beautifully photographed and professionally acted and directed. I can't wait until next season is released.
B008LFY6NI|2.0|you pick a shape, color and splash size then spin and color. that's it. period.it's fun for a short time but gets old real quick and when I let the three yr old play today many problems popped up.  first of many was with the two different ways to spin your artwork. you have the choice of clicking the spin button and/or spinning manually. this would be fine if the manual spin only worked when the spin button was highlighted. alas not so while splashing colors if you touch the screen too hard or the opposite way of the spin you will often unintentionally stop the spin. I use a stylus on my tablet but prefer to have the younger kids use fingers instead (they tend to push the stylus down too hard thus scratching up the screen guard). well I found out today it's almost impossible to make your choices without using the stylus. the different object buttons are so small that with using a finger it's hard to get it on the exact button you need (even with the small three yr old fingers). especially when trying to pick a color. the color grid is extremely tiny that even with a stylus you have a hard time clicking on the correct choice. most art games/apps have a costomized color choice choice (at least for paid ones) but not this one. as for the shapes you get about five or six. there are additional packets you can buy but each one only has that small amount too. so if you want all the available shape options you will end up paying over $5. thats more than most action game apps and anyone would be crazy to spend that much money on such a limited  art app. I really thought this would be fun to play with the kids. but even though I am always sitting right next to them while they play with the &quot;game pad&quot; kids do prefer to do things on their own. so when they loose the choice to be able to click all their own option, they loose interest very, very fast.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Artic Silver is the only Thermal Paste that I will use.<br />Maybe because it works for me and I have been using it like forever with never a problem.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just  an amazing book. It made me cry from happiness and sadness and understanding and every emotion you could imagine. So different from the movie, but both were good. Every teenager should read this.
031603438X|5.0|This is an amazing book. If you are a Rolling Stones fan you will will love it. It's Keith Richards.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great movie.  Craig does a great job as an aging, but very capable 007.  Great acting overall...would recommend.  Much better than the previous Bond film!

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|A wonderful, moving story.  Uplifting with humor and insight.  I've recommended this book to family and friends.  I'm looking forward to reading more stories by the author.
B005WWTW8M|4.0|The blu-ray version looks amazing.The commentary can be a little dull, but, the Crazy Helicopter flying, gun shooting, gnarly scenery and snowboarding are enough to keep even non-snowboarders entertained.
B00006AVRK|5.0|brilliant of course - VHS tapes in the bin - hours of delightful enjoyment - grab a glass & the remote - what more can I say
1400069807|3.0|I picked this up expecting something along the lines of \\"The end of overeating\\" which is a much more interesting book.<br /><br />In this book, the \\"how\\" from the subtitle focuses a little too much on the corporate history behind food processing, and not enough on the science of how that drives overeating and how we can break out of that.<br /><br />So read David Kessler's book first.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very interesting book and lots of very unexpected twists and turns.  Well written and easy to read.  I would highly recommend it.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel W. did a superb job of acting. But the film was more like a commercial for AA. The idea that he could function so well at that level of intoxication and addiction was not plausible.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|An interesting start and it just gets better (sillier?) as you read on. An interesting book about an interesting place.
B002TU1Q3Y|5.0|A real account from both sides. A page turner and an eye-opener. This was the first book ever to be written on a word processor!

B000OXHRRC|5.0|Simply put, We both loved watching this refreshing story! I would definitely recommend this movie to family and friends. Great!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I actually think I enjoyed the characters better than 50 Shades. 50 shades is more descriptive when it comes to scenes. I enjoyed the story line and the fact that the main character is not so Bella'ish when it comes to being a ditz.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Just rented this movie, had to come back and purchase it; AWESOME!!! is an understatement.. Love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; Paul was kind of cute as well... This movie is a must have for any video library.
B00APJLFEG|2.0|Great movie but the quality was awful. We had to start the movie over several times because it was skipping and pausing throughout the whole movie.
B0072KZ0Z6|2.0|The amount of crude humor and sex in this show totally outweighs the cutesy, quirky humor.  There are a lot of funny moments, but overall the show is just dirty.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The movie itself was good but the quality was awful. We had to start the movie over a few times. Very frustrating.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This was an awesome movie. Great for all you science fiction fans. Will keep you riveted with never a dull moment!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Spooky, twist ending that i was slightly disturbed by, could have been better. Great potential. Great as a rental. Horror fans will approve.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|This is a movie that is typical anti religious material that makes fun of anyone who believes in God. Would not recommend it to anyone!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Not really much can be said. This is a Muse album so there are some good love songs that are not sappy. There are some good rock songs and the usual revolution and overthrow government gems. I enjoyed it and listen to it daily.
0670022411|5.0|This is a riveting novel especially for those vampire and witch enthusiast. A great book to read and get into.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. I have loved it since its first episode, so I am a little biased. That being said this is the best season of the show and I would recommend buying it from Amazon. You can watch it on a multitude of devices and is really more convenient than purchasing through Xbox Live or the Playstation network.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This is an action packed movie for all you Stallone buffs. He has another great movie to add to his list.
B00BESKTMG|4.0|Love this movie! Loved it when I saw at the movies love it to view it on amazon instant and love it to own
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This is a great science fiction movie that you will love to watch with your friends. Will keep you in your seat.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show and what a great season. Thank you Amazon for giving me a venue to watch it!
B0021L8V0M|5.0|This is a great action packed movie. Will keep you guessing through the whole movie. Great to watch with your friends.
B00A5IYC38|4.0|Sort of hard to watch, as the protagonist and his friends are so self-destructive, but then it's probably a good depiction of a smart kid with limited life experience trying to make sense of the world.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This is a great movie. Our whole family loved watching it. It was a great inspiration seeing someone love a horse so much.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|This is a great soundtrack to a great movie!. I've listened to it many times and the music is very moving. John Williams is a great composer and this soundtrack adds to his already impressive list of movie music that he's writren and conducted in his career. Also the booklet to the cd has wonderful pictures from the film as well.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|What a cute movie. This is a great movie to watch with the whole family!  Great entertainment! Would recommend it to anyone.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I am getting in the habit of going to this app more & more.  No more sticky notes clinging on everything!  I love the choices of organizing for what is needed.

1603425381|5.0|I make hats, baby blankets, sweaters, and afghans for charities.  I do a lot of crochet.  I can add variety to the afghans/blankets.  I have also used some of the borders as brims on the hats.  this is important because I make hats for a local women/children's shelter and try to make each hat unique so it is easy to identify by the recipient.
0385333846|5.0|When you choose Slaughterhouse Five, which you all should, you need to know that your typical view of novels and ideas of certain genres must be \\"put away\\". Slaughterhouse Five is a war story... but it is not. It is also a Science-Fiction novel, but not really. The style of Vonnegut's book is unlike any other and it works.<br /><br />The story is about a man named Billy Pilgrim, who is a prisoner of war as the bombing of Dresden occurs, a bombing larger than Hiroshima, killing 130,000 people. Billy is held captive by the Germans in Dresden. The typical war story would have you in the middle of the action as everything occurred, describing the bombing as a great victory. There would be blood, guts, heroes, and glory all over the place. But Vonnegut doesn't even describe it. He writes an intellectual and creative story with war and aliens from outer space. The two don't seem like the most compatible of subjects, but the book is not a difficult read and for the most part flows well, as much as it possibly could anyway. Vonnegut's style and satiric humor make the time traveling war story a novel that everyone should read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this entire series! I love all the characters, the acting and how the show draws you into their lives. I hope it stays on the air for a long time.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I just love this show, and it keeps getting better and better. So much more invested in the characters and the relationship being drawn out keeps me coming back for more.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I only wish the U.S. had good shows like this without all the gore, language, sex and violence. I love this series!
B00AHXIC50|4.0|bruno mars is like a new-age michael jackson for anyone to listen to.  a little bit of slow, upbeat, and even soulful.
B000VOC90Y|3.0|Really wanted to love this computer bag after all the positive reviews however it will not comfortably hold my MSI GT 70 17\\" notebook.  I measured the length of my laptop and it is 16 and 7/8 inches and while it fits in the sleeve the two top corners of the laptop are completely unprotected by anything except a zipper...and even that is stretched extremely tight over the laptop frame.  So still searching.  In all fairness, the MSI is a pretty thick laptop and perhaps that is taking up some of the room in the sleeve.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Incredibly easy to access, easy to use, and just entirely awesome.  I move music from my cloud right to this app, and then i have my music everywhere i go.
B004OT2S8K|5.0|My Son was so happy to get this for Xmas.  It was a good price.  I received it in time for the holidays and made him very happy.
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|this album is worthwhile.  fun, upbeat, but it has a touching side as well.  it held up to my expectations.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|If I enjoyed reading books that had sad stories, I would have rated this book 5 stars.  My rating was based on MY personal preference only.  This book is very well written and IS a page-turner indeed.  Don't start this book late at night because you won't want to put it down once you start.<br /><br />Now that I'm through, would I read it again? No. It was just too depressing a topic. I feel like I need a valium or a drink after reading that.....and not in a good way. I love stories that keep me tense and on edge in a good way, but this wasn't in a good way.<br /><br />My first love in books is romance, and although there is a very strong love story in this book, this book is NOT a romance. To me, it was sad and depressing. There were a lot of really sweet moments in this book, but more bitter-sweet in a lot of ways.<br /><br />Some of you may like it, but although I couldn't put it down once I started it, it just wasn't my cup of tea. I do think she is a gifted author and there was a twist at the end regarding her adopted Mom that I never saw coming.
B00BHMF578|1.0|I was excited to watch this movie after it did so well at the oscars... however it was a complete waste of time.  Slow, uninteresting, poorly acted (at least affleck) I don't understand how this movie won any awards.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Works well and is easy to carry or toss in a pack or bag. Works well and is easy to use.
030746363X|5.0|I'm 40% into 4HB and am slowly adapting to the slowcarb lifestyle and using my instagram fooddiary @asteinke0814 I highly recommend you read any or all 3 of the 4H books if you are the type to really analyze what you are doing in your life to get to where you want to be and be willing to change it. I read a lot of books about life and health and so far, Tim Ferris has been who I have best connected with.<br /><br />Try it. What do you have to lose besides a little weight. :D
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best season yet! I think most television is stupid, and will not pay for cable, however this show is worth $1.99 a week. This is story telling at it's finest. I have not watched a dramatic television series this entertaining since the Soprano's. The cast and crew are getting better at what they are doing, also.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|Again, I really enjoyed the story line. Anxiously anticipating the final book of the trilogy. I know this series, as well as The Hunger Games and Divergent are geared towards YA ( young adult ) readers but I am not a teenager and I thoroughly enjoyed<br />them all. The only downside is that I feel the author can be overly descriptive and wordy to the point where I often forget what she is describing.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is awesome! Better than temple run, and it allows me to take out my anger on fruits i hate.
B00632HWOG|2.0|but i am EXTREMELY annoyed that you can't log out once you are logged in.  I have multiple accounts and can't sign out of the one to sign into the others!  If this problem is remedied, i will give it 5 stars
B006LSZECO|4.0|Two parallel stories that collide into one. Just when you think it's getting predictable, it surprises you. Very interesting character dynamics. Perfectly detailed personality traits, Amy is especially complex. Not thrilled with the ending, I could've kept reading, but I appreciate the implication and \\"you can take it from here\\" angle. Great easy read for the twisted relationship, suspense lover.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|This was brilliant to read as the format of a post-post-apocalyptic documentary really makes it far more fascinating and allows the story to cover more angles than just one individual fighting for their own survival.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very cool! Wish there was an easier way to get gems!<br />I like how you control the horse!
B006Z9K97E|5.0|I often have hard times being patient enough to finish books I buy.<br />However, Escape from Camp 14, is a true and a horrific story which I finished in a record time. I will never forget Shin's story and I'm so grateful for his courage and strong mind, which gave him the strength to share his story.<br /><br />This book is a must read for all people, not only the ones who want to know more about North Korea.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was absolutely Amazing!!! I loved the close details and story line!!! I would read this book over and over and over again!

B005UDD1R6|4.0|Plays every video I've put on my Kindle so far. The problem is that when I close my kindle cover (I just hit pause, and don't exit the app), and then come back to it later, the instant I open the cover, the app starts playing the movie.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I absolutely love this show. The DVD's came to me in perfect condition, and I've had no issues with them.
B000Q66Q9C|5.0|I gave this as a gift --- very well received, in fact, one of the favorites of my 8 year old nephew.  Love that there are 3 movies to choose from for one price!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I've yet to have a problem with this app. Emails show up the instant wireless is turned on, and I can see more using this app than I can on my computer.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Having read all the Bosch books, this one is in the middle to bottem. Finished reading it out of obligation.
B00AKO93JK|2.0|But I don't like that I can't skip anything, and I have to do everything in the order the app has designated. I'd like to be able to scroll through a list of exercises, and then watch a video of how the move is done. Maybe if you could select several exercises off the list and then have the app string all of the videos together, then I'd give a higher rating.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This reads like a rough draft written by a child. The plot is so stereotypical of a fantasy novel that it almost feels like its mocking the genre. When the author bothers with character development, its inconsistent. She tries too hard to make the landscape unusual without putting any effort into making it believable. And really, was this book edited? Every other paragraph contains a grammatical error- switching \\"their\\" for \\"they're\\" or \\"his\\" for \\"her\\". I'm no grammar nazi, but this book made me twitch. I want to take a red pen to my copy and mail it back to the author, but that would mean having to read through it again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have had none of the problems that I've heard others complain about with this app. Operation is pretty seamless, and the pictures that my friends post show up HUGE, unlike on a computer where the pics are rather tiny, and in order to see any detail you have to click on the pic.
B0058O84G0|5.0|Every time I turned to my kindle to read this book I got transported into another world ... And I loved it.
B003YVCJQ0|4.0|17 years after the original release, I watched this film with my family again. Nothing really exceptional about it, but still entertaining for the genre and holds up against similar, more recent movies.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I dont want to be a spoiler so I wont say exactly what I thought.  It totally caught me off guard with the ending though.  I doubt the movie will live up to the book, but I am still looking forward to it.  Nicholas Sparks is GOOD!!!!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Such a cute movie and concept. My 4 year old LOVES it too. Good for adults AND kids, which is sometimes hard to do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game me and my friend play and talk about it all the time we love how they change places like Rome and Italy its so fun and the different there's always some cool holiday theme going on its a great game and everyone must buy this is they have any kind of device!!! :)
0452270073|4.0|I found this a fascinating book!! I am really interested in anything about medicine and so found the description of early psychological treatments of WWI veterans very interesting. Also, that the whole trilogy is based on fact, on the real life meeting of the poet Sigfried Sassoon and his doctor during his rehabilitation W.H.R. Rivers. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00422LESO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  If you're a fan of Jane Austen books and/or movies, you will enjoy this novel.  It's a fun & quick read and you really get swept up in the story--the romance, the characters, the setting.  Other reviewers have outlined the plot well, so I won't bother with another retelling.  I thought the book was well-written and funny, and I know it's a book I'll reread.  It makes you wish you could visit such a place in real life!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story line and composition. Thoroughly enjoyed reading it and the shift series. Can't wait for the next ones to come out.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved this book!! I was skeptical to read it just by looking at the cover picture but this is one book where the old adage of \\" don't judge a book by its cover\\" definitely rings true!
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|I do like Makita products and the customer service has been excellent in my experience. I also owned Porter Cable and Bostitch brad nailers of the same capacity but they don't come close to the performance of this Makita. I have started to buy Makita power tools as well to replace other brands that are worn out or work poorly and so far I've never been disapointed. Makita is a quality brand and this nailier is no exception.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show has had me hooked since day one!  I loved were they've taken the story.  I would like to see them on the run again maybe trying to go out to find other ppl.  We will just have to wait and see...
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Based on Sol Yurick's 1965 novel of the same name, the Warriors combines fast-action storytelling and inner city images of New York City into an enjoyable and entertaining cult classic. The plot is purely simple: When a charismatic gang leader is shot at an open air convention in the Bronx meant to unite all the gangs in New York City, a gang from Coney Island called the Warriors get blamed and have to fight back to their own turf--which means an escalating series of battles with colorful and improbable gangs like the the Turnbull ACs, the Orphans, the Baseball Furies, the Punks, and the Lizzies- learning from the latter that everyone believes they killed Cyrus. This is a story of young men, and one crazy girl caught up in urban violence by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The plot is simple, the acting is good- particularly Michael Beck's and Deborah Van Valkenburgh's, the action is fast and without special effects, and the diverse pop, rock, and techno music is excellent.
B004E547D8|5.0|If you like old fashioned shoot-em-ups, this is worth watching!  Bruce Willis steals the show, but all the lead characters have their moments.
B003VANOFY|2.0|They start out a little snug, but over time they will loosen up and not squeeze your head so much.  After a week or so they fit great and sounded good too.<br /><br />The problem is that the headset would cut out around 10 times in an hour.  It was like the headset basically rebooted.  All sound would stop for about 5 seconds before coming back.  I searched Google and found out that it was a frequent and common problem.  Some people said it was caused by interference from wireless routers but I shut everything off in my house that used wireless and the problem never went away.  I spent countless hours reading about the problem but could never find a fix that worked so I eventually gave up and returned the headset.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|This is one of those movies that really gets you to thinking...realizing just how vast the universe is!  It's only human arrogance that makes us believe WE are the premier beings in this great big unknown.  The controversy about religion vs. science has a valid point - it's highly unlikely any 'alien' race prays to the same god as us humans, so how would we treat them once we discover them?!  If we can't even get along with our own kind, how likely is it we would welcome a totally alien way of life.  Yeahhh....that's the trillion dollar question!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think this is a great version of the classic card game. I play it constantly when I need to pass time.
B004ZG5EYC|4.0|I love this movie...but didn't realize it was only in the French language.  Reading sub-titles detracts from the movie experience.  Maybe I should learn French...lol!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My aunt recommended the series to me.  Season 2 is proving to be just as great as season 1.  I recommend to anyone interested in drama.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie was so awesome. I couldn't get enough of it.  Abraham Lincoln was beast in this movie.<br />Can't wait until it comes on cable. This movie is a must see!
0385344333|1.0|I will preface this by saying that I have read every Jack Reacher / Lee Child book.<br />I also will not ever see a \\" Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher\\" movie - for I can't<br />believe that such a physical character as Jack Reacher can be portrayed<br />by diminutive Tom Cruise (but that's a different story)<br /><br />I read this with the assumption that Mr. Child would have changed his<br /> trait of physical style Jack Reacher to more meet the size and style of Tom Cruise -<br />and he does and doesn't go down that road. Although there is reference to Reacher<br />being a six foot five  \\"giant gorilla\\" in the book, there really is no action to speak<br />of except for the last 35 pages of the book.<br />  For a book that started off excellent and wanted me to keep reading, after the first<br />80 pages or so this book turns into a COMPLETE BORE!<br />It is, imho, the worst Jack Reacher book - bar none.<br /> One could have edited out 100 pages of boring cross country driving and convoluted<br />assumptions (by the characters) in the middle of this book...but that would have only amplified this<br />shallow, simplistic, weak plotted book.  ughh.<br /> I found myself skimming pages just to get done.  I leaned over to my wife with<br />about 100 pages left and said \\"this book sucks\\".  I only finished it<br />because I wanted \\"closure\\" -lol<br />  ughh.  don't waste your time.<br />0 stars except for the first 80 pages or so which really was intriguing.<br /> Did I mention the booooorrrrrring, repetitive cross country, in-country, and around the country driving<br />and talking?
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I enjoy watching old gangster style movies, so it was nice to see Shia LaBeouf in a movie again and a gangsta movie at that. I would recommend this movie for all Shia LaBeouf fans.
160774273X|5.0|And now I can make my own, and ask for help if recipes don't work out!<br /><br />This is my favorite carb cookbook with gorgeous photos too.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This movie was not Colin Ferrell best movie but it turned out to be okay.<br />I would recommend this movie but not as a must see movie.
B00821OX98|4.0|This loosely-based science fiction will gather an audience subset of those dismissive of zombiemania, zombie and vampire series fans, and some who may avoid science fiction entirely.  DISTRICT 9 fans might find solace.  The writers simulate the ravaged world of the protagonists by stuttering our focus upon human dynamics (what would I do?) in a chaos of known and theoretical science, developmental and deviant psychology, martial law, history of war, evolution of government, romance, and the success/failure of snap decisions (read BLINK or OUTLIERS, ).  Finding and winding a path to safety and increasing probabilities of survival is less a game of multi-seat teetertotter than detonating pick-up sticks, on the run.  Enjoy the story, superb digital effects and makeup.<br />Detractors will notice protagonists never lose weight (should be a pound a week) but(t) jeans are tight, perfect teeth (except middle-agers and character actors), and the lives of the tag-along civilian population are unknown.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Me & my family enjoyed watching the The Dark Knight Rises<br />It was a great movie and it did not put us to sleep. I recommend this movie as thee movie to watch.
B001BR5NN0|2.0|Couldn't watch online because the flow of the movie was not good.  It kept stopping and then starting, like a delay in the film.  Couldn't stand that happening, so I rented it for nothing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for all ages. Its addicting and perfect for those long train rides and its free you should definitely download and play.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Great Cast and Wonderful directing make this a compelling reboot of the franchise. I can't wait for the next one!
B008D30K7E|5.0|Since I purchased the book I cannot put it down. I would recommend this to all who want something different
B008SLAXGO|5.0|It came early. Although the bottom part was bent. Not extremely bent but a tad bit. but it was still in good condition. Love Gaga and this book is hard to be left alone. Will be looking at this everyday!
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Too bad all commanding officers weren't like this, most were in it for the medals and rank, even had a co commander who told us that&#34; there were alot of booby traps in that tree line, and the only way to finf 'em , was to hit 'em&#34; !!! He didn't command long !!

B00B935SUY|5.0|As a music enthusiast, the retelling of the story of the Sound City was really fascinating.  I found the first hour of the movie to be the most intriguing.  During this part of the film the now renowned musicians, engineers, producers and others involved in the with the studio talk about what made the space such a unique sound and experience, which, ultimately led to some of the best rock recordings ever produced.<br />The documentary, however, loses steam in the final half hour or so.  At this point the setting moves to Dave Grohl's personal studio in which he has just outfitted it with the old sound board from Sound City (That, on its own, is a special commemorative, in a way a passing-of-the-torch, part of music history.)  The rest of the way some of the musicians collaborate in the new studio and produce a new track(s).  It just didn't hold my attention like the historical record told in most of the movie that preceded it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I must say this is that funniest game I've ever played keep making more like this !you got my vote 5stars baby !!!!!!
B008LFY6NI|2.0|I am sure it would be a great app but I bought it twice 2 dollors and it downloaded but would not install so maybe
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a game like temple Run but even more fun and stunts.Also it is better there is trains included and has people that you can buy with the coins you get while playing the game.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Very easy, cómodo , conveniente y muy fácil de usar me gusta he estado usando este app por algunos años
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It starts off with authors daring life and then treatment from a very rare disease. The last 30 percent of the book gets into some very interesting and insructive material.  Worth reading
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|The roller coaster ride of thrills starts on page one and keeps going the entire time!  I enjoyed this thriller and would recommend to anyone who likes a good murder mystery. I look forward to reading more about Max Larkin and Jesse Fairlaine.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|Please allow me to digress and pontificate. I think one of the worst questions is &#34;why do you love me?” it simply causes the responder to list character traits behaviors and the like. For me a list like that really has nothing to do with why I love someone.  So strangely enough it is with this movie as well. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet do an awesome job in this movie. I really enjoyed seeing Jim C. in this roll. Kate's character was a perfect canvas for someone with her chops.  The supporting cast is perfectly constructed with actors who typically have lead or at least larger rolls and they were a beautiful thing to watch. I like the way it was shot, the time sequencing, and the look in general.  I must tell you that none of that speaks to why I like it so well. This movie can grab you viscerally and hold on for its length.  Have a try you will have a reaction one way or the other and for me that makes it art.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is a Blu-ray cut of Firefly. If you are a fan of Science Fiction and have not seen this do yourself a favor and check this out. Great HD cut for a show that only lasted one season, but at least was given closure with the movie ending the story Serenity.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book.  Well written.  The story gets a little far fetched near the end, but it was still an exciting read.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Based on a true story, and only slightly exaggerated for cinematic effect. Easy to see why it won Best Picture at the Oscar's this year.
B005PK553C|4.0|I typically do watch &#34;Horror&#34; but was cueriouw to see what all the fuss was about regarding this series...so tried it and got hooked.<br />While still not into seeing alot of the &#34;gore&#34;...but found the story line interesting and enjoyable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This novel was just what I needed. It reminded me of the hope I had with my young loves. The fun and learning about passion. It's inspiring as well to believe that even thru huge trauma that life keeps going. Great read.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|Cartoons are never my choice to have watched, but when supervising kids watching tv it at least had some amusement value.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i actually never played but i have heared seen and watched stuff mine craft on youtube and it sounds amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I am a big Clint Eastwood fan.  I wouldn't say this is his best film. but it is a good story and the supporting actors are quite good.
B00004CXYQ|2.0|the dvd did not play on a dvd player. It had a restriction on the ability to play. it really SUCKED,
B001R4MEUM|5.0|This is THE best Genesis album there is. It's goes to prove that Phil Collins' pop writing was not needed in the writing here! Brian Eno plays on In The Cage and does the sound effects on The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging, in return that Phil Collins plays drums on Mother Whale Eyeless on Brian Eno's solo album [[ASIN:B00015TOCY Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy]]. Phil also played drums on Brian Eno's [[ASIN:B00022M51I Another Green World]] in 1975. Peter Gabriel in an interview on The Lamb stated that the story of Rael was an influence of Alejandro Jodorawski's 1970 movie [[ASIN:B004LWL0YS El Topo [Blu-ray]]]
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Great movie if you like Civil War, SciFi, Action Adventure all in one. Plus you have a romantic story.  I think adults all ages will enjoy
B008XG1X18|5.0|I joined out of curiosity at first, and now I'm hooked!  I have learned so much about our world just from re-pinning other people's pictures, and there are a lot of funny things, too!  Also, touching, breathtaking, cute, amazing, personal... there's architecture, photography, nature, art, animals, and more.  The ancient!  The new!  You can't go wrong in joining Pinterest!<br /><br />P.S. I understand it can be used for work/school projects and presentations, etc., also...(but what fun is that?! lol!).
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Quick's style of writing is so enticing, it just pulls you right in.  The plot moves right along and keeps you going, wanting to know more about the characters of his novel.  I was kinda disappointed the movie-version was so different from the book.  As they always say, &#34;The book is so much better than the movie!&#34;
B007BT0RKG|3.0|It's nice to have maps available when there's no WiFi, although you need to download additional maps in advance. Still, it can be very helpful when GPS  or WiFi not there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a great, easy read.  I totally recommend this book!  I can't wait to see it in movie-form.
6301562178|5.0|Great actors throughout whole picture ,constant action going on at all times switching from one place to another and leaving you watching every little corner of what's going to happen next , good ending I recommend this picture to anyone who likes action and excitement and lots of it
0765325950|4.0|I'm a huge WOT fan. This long awaited book is non-stop action from start to finish, and is overall a wonderful book, it was a bit disappointing for the end. Several characters seemed to act, well, out-of-character and the ending was not quite was I was hoping for. It is very difficult to pull off an ending to a series with such high expectations, however, and I still highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Christian Grey had zero charisma. He read like a freshman in college, not a powerful self made billionaire CEO!<br /><br />What a waste of my time! Thankfully I stopped half way through and found a true novel!<br /><br />This is the first review I took the time to write because I want to warn others to save yourself the trouble and skip this series.
B004KZOWEG|4.0|Paints the picture of why even today Africa is lacking the institutions that could lead to a stable democracy and economic growth. The cold brutal efffects of such a cruel, inhumane and utterly injust conquest has left in the Dark Continent wounds that even in the 21st century remain open pores.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Horse action is true to life. Has a lot of short games to play and the ability to move up quickly. Only wish there were more and/or easier ways to earn gems and sell back track even if for a discounted price. Overall,a good product.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great movie thruout.  A little sex, enough drugs. Too much alcohol.  REal drama, and adult situations, Shocking turn arounds that really made the movie.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Interesting, if a little vague at times, will grab your attention and keep it. Becomes a page turner about half way.
030726999X|5.0|It's hard to characterize this book: Swedish author & settings; ex-Nazis & neo-Nazis, gangs, corruption, violence; lots of twists & turns & surprises; definitely read these in order!

0061020680|5.0|I really like all of Terry Pratchett's Discworld (fantasy) books, including this one.  You will best enjoy reading them in the order published, but they're good on their own.  They have a unique, fey humor: I expect you will like all or none, so if they're new to you, get just one to begin with.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book took turns that I wasn't expecting and I loved reading every moment of it. Awesome story about life, love and bravery.

0307352153|5.0|Studies show that one-third to a half of us are introverted. Wether you realize this or not, that has huge implications for how we operate.<br /><br />A friend said to me, \\"Ben, you should read this book because it will give you valuable insight on how introverts operate.\\" Well, he was right.<br /><br />Through a litany of stories, research, and personal experience, Susan Cain reveals the true implications of what it means to be introverted in an American culture that has an \\"extrovert ideal.\\"<br /><br />I appreciate the openness and insight to the introverted mind along with the call to action for operating differently in our culture.<br /><br />Cain tackles four issues which I appreciate:<br />1. How our schools have promoted an extrovert ideal<br />2. You don't have to be extroverted to be a leader<br />3. Collaboration can actually kill creativity<br />4. How we can cultivate kids who are naturally quiet<br /><br />Whether you pick up this book for professional or personal insight, you won't be disappointed. The content has huge implications for how you operate at your job and in your family.<br /><br />I love this book, and I'm not even an introvert!<br /><br />*I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group in exchange for my review.
B000J103N4|5.0|If I Could Only Remember My Name is a masterpiece.  There is not a bad track on the CD, not to mention, the sound production is superb.  This was David Crosby's first solo, post Byrds and during the beginnings of CSN and sometimes Y, album which showed the creative juices were in full flow.  Backed up by already established artists such as some the members of Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead along with Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Graham Nash etc., etc., etc., how could this album be anything but a success. The CD + DVD(audio only) which has been remastered in HDCD and Dolby (DVD) was well worth the money.  What was once old is now new.  Whether it is the jam &#34;Music Is Love&#34; or &#34;Laughing&#34; or &#34;What Are Their Names&#34; all the songs are very melodic, textured and layered with beautiful vocal Harmonies.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It took awhile to get hooked in this story but about a third of the way in I couldn't put . It down. Entertaining story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive it's like when you smoke (I don't of course) you can't stop<br />If you are not addicted to this comment and tell me!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am addicted to this program. Can't get enough. It is like eating the best cheesecake, hard to stop. The cast is excellent & compliment each other superbly. The writing is excellent.  I feel a part of each episode & look forward to season 3.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|All of the Harry Bosch mysteries are excellent. They are not over the top but are down to earth and believable. I enjoy all of Michael Connelly's books.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game. Better than diner dash! I can play this for hours. Wish there were more restaurants. A must have!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|What can you say?. It's the godfather at it's best. You don't need to look for anything else, this is how God intended you to wath The Godfather
B001XULSG6|4.0|This one had a descent story line (even if using an old basis of time travel). Good action plus science. They didn't try to hard to use every character too much, but focussed on a few. The borg is one of the best storylines out of the next generation and viewer generally can't get enough. This movies gives some, but could have gone a lot further.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|After reading this book in two days I can't find anything comparable yet! Simply a perfect and easy read! I would highly recommend everyone to read this!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Follett is a great writer...one of the best. However; lately he has become too wordy, He can do better  in fact he has done better many times. Get to the point and tell the story instead of rambling on and on and on!!
B0090P0O70|5.0|There are so many versions of Frankenstein in both print and digital versions.<br />I finally settled on this one.<br />It was well formatted and had no egregious typos.<br />Note that this version provides nothing but the book -- no intro or analysis.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|The familiar characters are adorable, love each other and engage you in their lives!  The references to mythology provided an opportunity for me to expose my grandchildren to those stories.
B00BGDF1FO|4.0|There are no real stinkers on this album, but just when the songs get going they all end. While hitting repeat is pretty easy, it kind of takes you out of the moment. Still, this is an astoundingly good soundtrack for a fantastic action game and well worth the discount digital price.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very interesting learning the general outline of this situation. The tension level is very high! You will not be disappointed!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is awesome game my daughter loves it is like a real horse and she's learning while she's playing the game!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Got this for kindle fire HD.  It is fun to play . The graphics are great.  The puzzles varied in difficulty.  It runs well.  I have no complaints.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a great read satisfying the romance and thriller aspects of what I look for in books. With the way the author wrote these characters, it was so easy to slip into them and understand what they were experiencing and how it felt.  Also, the plot of the story was intriguing enough I couldn't foretell where the story was headed!  A great read!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great writing, great acting, and totally unpredictable! So glad to have started watching Game of Thrones.  The series contains a lot of graphic material, language, and nudity= perfect show!

B004Z2TUGE|2.0|Good movie for high school and college guys, maybe, but it didn't get a thumbs up in my household, where we have one middle aged guy and lots of females!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I always find it hard to read about violent husbands or men so that part I did not enjoy.  Wouldn't say it was the best book I've ever read but a good yarn.
B008XG1X18|4.0|i looove pinterest so many fun ideas people have! the only problem, is that i follow one board from a person, and then it makes me follow ALL their boards, but thats probably a website glitch other than thay its awesome!

0062082353|5.0|An excellent book! Told matter of factly by a first hand account of a great Warrior. If you want to keep your head in the sand, then read about it in a history book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is really cool and fun love playing it the Rome one is really fun and funny but the others are really fun too!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Extremely addictive, can't seem to put it down. I enjoyed the free version,so decided to buy the full version,since I play a lot of Mah jong. This is a great version of the game.
B002NVTSGQ|3.0|Some of the situations are great comedic fun, others don't always hit the mark for me. I'm hoping there is improvement over time with the next seasons.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great characters and creative story line!  If you enjoy a nice balance between sci-fi and mystery thriller, you'll love this!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've heard about this from several friends and acquaintences, so I checked it out myself.  I LOVE this series.  I thoroughly enjoyed season 1 and am so looking forward to season 2!
0345803493|5.0|This sequel did not disappoint.  It's truly a page turner, can't wait for the next chapter.  Just don't want this story to end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I were late start watching, but got caught up by watching several episodes a night.  Great acting and scenery and characters you love to hate and others you hate to see go. Well done tying to historical world events.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|this series is awesome and can't wait for next season.  My husband and I enjoy watching it. PBS is great.
B007IK44CK|5.0|The epitome of an action film. Tom Cruise delivers again. Highly recommended. What will MP V look like to top this?
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|NO original story line with poor actors.Movie was so slow and drawn out I almost went to sleep Southern. Accents of actors made the movie almost intolerable.
B007712XAU|5.0|I hardly think a comment is needed.  This wonderful show speaks for itself.  I just wanted to own my copies to watch and re-watch.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|What a waste of money. I wanted to see more of the big guy, or more of the back story, but it was just too much going on and not enough story.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, keeps your attention all the way through the movie.  I would recommend this as a must see.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie deserves every accolade that it receives.  Well worth the time to watch!  I have a whole new respect for Ben Affleck after this movie (not that his other work was not noteworthy).
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Gorgeous pacing and a sharp focus on the important things in life. A story about a boy who manages to hold onto his gentle humanity, told with wit, humor, and restraint.
B00112ASYO|4.0|I might be a little old to still buy toys and figures, but the Crocodile and Alligator are my favorite species of reptiles; probably because I am from Florida.<br /><br />This toy, which I didn't realize, is a good size of about four and a half inches in length, and about an inch high.<br /><br />The detail is fairly good, the paint was a higher quality but crocodile itself looks a tad cartoon to me- however for a child, I doubt they would notice this at all until older The species accuracy is also very good in detail, but the overall detail and scheme could have been better moved away from the bulky features and painting style- but this is considered a toy, not a model, and I would consider this one more for younger children to not scare them.<br /><br />It came nicely packaged, and very quickly at standard shipping rates, and I am sure that if your child or even adult loves reptiles like I do, this would be a nice addition to their collection. Currently, it sits on top of the hutch of my desk.<br /><br />I would recommend this product over again, and have bought others.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Although it was a little on the short side. But I did not want to put it down. I strongly recommend this book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved Silver Linings Playbook!!  I read it in 3 days and then went and saw the movie.  The movie was great, but the book is even better!  I highly recommend this book!
B004OZZ624|4.0|I enjoy watching this movie with the twists and turns. It ended with happy ending and kept me on the edge of my seat thinking and wondering.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham spins a yarn with plenty of twists and turns in this classic. This book has you cheering for the good guy, no matter how bad he is!
B0019GO5DC|4.0|I remember really liking this movie as a kid, especially the end part! But when I bought it and watched it a couple of times the magic was gone... I caught the foul language more and crude remarks and not the romance I had once remembered it for. What a shame.
0897502027|5.0|the commentary is in vane<br />this is a book from a genius<br />yeah, as a human he might had imperfections but in martial arts is the number one pioneer

B00514HDNW|3.0|I find the book starting dry. I had trouble getting started with the book.i stoped after a couple chapters. Maybe I will try reading again in the future.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is easy and challenging. The only problem is there isn't more boards.  This is the first game I bought for my Kindle and very happy.  Adults and kids can both get hours of enjoyment from this game.
0385535147|5.0|I bought this book and sent it to the other part of the world, to Uruguay, located at the southernmost tip of South America.<br />I am very happy with the service because in a week I had th ebook in my hand after it travelled thousands of miles, to finally reach my doorbell.<br />Also, the book is superb, as all of Grishams.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|If you are looking for a Anger Birds type game this would not be it.  After a few boards this game requires you to really thing about how to build your machine to get the piggies down the mountain.  It is entertaining but not mindless fun like other games like this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Its all about real people, I could'nt stop watching the three series till there was no more! Beautifully acted, beautiful dresses.<br />Cant wait to see more.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|The insturctions were not clear how to actually play this game.  It is fun when I got the hang of it but also quite challenging.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such a breathtaking book. It truly felt for Charlie. I felt like I was really his friend. I love it. I'd personally read it again. Now I have to watch the movie. Once again, the book is magnificent!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game! If you are looking for something to pass some time....Here it is! It reminds me of Mahjong Tiles but in a 3D Cube.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Perhaps the best Bond film ever.  Daniel Craig displayed his acting a physical chops.<br />The cast of characters is changing with a new Q and and a replacement for M who dies in Skyfall.<br />Can't wait for the next episode.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Definitely for art house movie lovers.  Quirky and fanciful.  Two youngsters who are outsiders find each other and run away.  You will identify with various feelings and scenes, depending on your own first love experiences.
B00005JKED|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and i was happy to find it at a very affordable price, it arrived in a timely manner. Im a satisfied customer.<br /><br />Thank You!
B002N1RM5A|3.0|I love Kaufmann's voice, but am not too impressed by this music by Schubert.  I hope to find other recordings by him.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun. You get to feed train your you horse. Lots of fun you should try it out yourself.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watched several episodes a day ... couldn't get enough of it.  Plot line was very compelling and very cleverly put together.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so amazing! I am rating this a 5 because it was a great book. It teaches you a lot. It is very emotional and makes you think about your life and all the things you should appreciate. That you can still have a good life and wonderful times even if bad things have happened to you. If you find your group and the people who bring out the best in you then just be happy! Let the little things in life be the big things and let them take you far.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game. I just wish you could wash the horses with soap and water. I hope you like it too
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is the app I was waiting for!!! It's beyond fast and just amazing! I love it you must get it... BEST APP EVER!!!
B00015YVD6|5.0|I fell in love with this movie when I saw it in a Poconos theater with a bunch of other camp counselors on our day off. It's still a fantastic and timeless story and holds up excellently! The only thing dated about the movie are the cars and TVs but who cares?! It's a great movie! When's it coming out on blu-ray!?!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|When I first got this app, I would play it for hours!!! And it's still really fun! If you don't have this app you must get it! It's addicting!!! It's definitely a must-have app!!!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I enjoyed the challenge. It is more challenging than angry bird's. Consumers times. It is fun. Don't what else to say.
B00A757EFW|3.0|to fast for an old guy. Used to have the game in a big machine in my basement. Brings back memories.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I read this in a book club.  Everyone loved it.  They thought it was informative, well written and held their attention.

0802473156|5.0|The examples and anecdotes make this book easy to understand and useful.  I found myself nodding along while reading.  Highly recommend!
1400049628|5.0|This was just what I wanted. Very happy with product. Came quickly. packaged well. No problems would use seller again.
0307730697|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  After reading, I purchased more copies to give to others. A very moving story about overcoming very difficult odds to be the best of the best. Adam Brown was an incredible example.
1451673442|4.0|I like the first half especially, as it reminds us of all the things in life to be grateful for and not take for granted. I got bogged down in the middle where she wants us to use magical thinking to get checks in the mail.<br /><br />I did love the being grateful for all the people who help us like busboys and gardeners. I remember to greet cleaners in buildings now, and they look surprised that someone actually sees them.<br /><br />Another good idea, not originally hers, but from  that great inspiring Earl Nightengale --  that nothing we do is accomplished or enjoyed or used without the help of countless unknown people who helped to make what we use, or eat, or wear every day. Thank them.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Aliens are about the bombard the Earth into extinction, and the only hope for the world is Agent J (Will Smith). He has to travel back in time to the 1960's to save a much-younger Agent K (Josh Brolin) from death at the hands of a time-traveling alien before Agent K can obtain protective, alien technology to shield the world from alien attack.<br /><br />This whole series is a real hoot. I've greatly enjoyed all three films, including this one. Will Smith is terrific, as always, but Tommy Lee Jones has a much smaller part in this third installment, and I did miss him as a co-star of the movie. However, Josh Brolin does a great job playing the younger version of Agent K.<br /><br />A particular standout in the film for me was the New Zealand comedic actor Jemaine Clement ([[ASIN:B003L7DK74 Flight of the Conchords]]) who plays the villain, Boris, a motorcycle-riding alien with horrible eyes and teeth.<br /><br />This is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy together--though it might be a bit scary for children under the age of 10 or so.
B00BAHKQW4|4.0|This game takes me back to the early days of gaming.  Very nice and easy to play. I have spent hours at a time playing this
B005K17RU0|3.0|Right off the bat, it has out home location wrong and I cannot figure out how to change it so I had to add our home as a &#34;favorite&#34;. Also wanted to use for our travel destination but whether it was the wi-fi at the hotel or the app, it never would work so at this time I don't know how useful it will be but it was free.
B00A77II0U|4.0|this game has a good story and is easy to play.  the game has good graphics and runs without any issues.
B00992CF6W|5.0|How do you do multiplayer? Scanning screen just scans never does anything else. I put my Kindles next to each other. YouTube is  useless. Please write a review someone who knows how to do this. What am I missing?<br /><br />I click the app and click start with one device. I click on a world. With my other Kindle I click join game. The Kindles are right next to each other but one won't join the other. Anything I need to do? I will be checking for the miracle review!<br /><br />Non-scam Minecraft apps<br />Pocket InvEditor Pro<br />Minecraft Seeds Pro (not exploding grass block wheat seeds don't confuse)<br />Minecraft Skins Pro
1843106698|5.0|I learned so much about my husband and what AS entails. It was incredibly complete and easy to understand. I cannot recommend this book enough.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This tense thriller is so engrossing from the beginning that putting down is impossible.  The politics of the police department are an interesting backdrop for the story.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Whether you're seventeen or seventy, this book is incredible. I'm a teenager and I absolutely loved this book. Every time I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about the book. Definitely recommend for everyone! It really connects to everyone, no matter what the age.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I did not like this movie, in fact, I didn't even finish watching. Parts were so dark I could't tell what was happening.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This product has been seamless in function and very quick so it's been very useful.  I would recommend to all
B002ZG9968|4.0|I like the actors in this so I was glad to purchase it on sale. It has a pretty basic plot, but I still enjoyed it. I like all the supporting actors in this movie as well. Fun to watch but I would make sure little kids aren't around to watch it. :)
B009AVC922|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking. I always have and always will consider this a timeless classic. There is a japanese commentary and several trailers for other great anime. Commentary is kinda whatever unless you speak fluent japanese. Definitely buy this! For true anime fans!!!
B000FVE3A2|4.0|I haven't had the watch long enough to evaluate<br />it's performance yet. However it is a beautiful watch,<br />the only faults I have with it are the skeletal back, and<br />the wristband. I would prefer the back to be solid stainless<br />steel, and I had hoped the wristband would have been<br />A true divers band,(one that expands to go over the<br />wetsuit sleeve. I'll have to give the watch a few months<br />to evaluate it's performance as a dive watch.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|good game, keeps me busy and I don't have to rush through either. able to build how you want. A+++++
B0041O1V72|5.0|I was so happy to find this book to pass on to another generation of readers!  Its story is never outdated!
B004OT6PR0|5.0|The Technic Flatbed Truck was just enough of a  challenge  for our grandson to put together.  He loves the mechanical features and continues to use it as a toy.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I purchased it but I cannot download the product.  It is very frustrating.  I will be very selective of what to purchase the next time
B0084P9202|4.0|For Sigur Ros fans, this doesn't provide anything particularly new, but for those who enjoy their sound, it's another great representation.  Especially good for trips, reading, or working as background noise.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|one thing that irritated the heck out of me when I first started playing the game was that it REQUIRED wick. I get really annoyed at games that do this. this app is on a mobile device and I want to be able to play it wherever I want. plz fix this Lubia and this could be an amazing game. another problem I found was that if you needed to press on the screen to complete an action u had to press hard on the screen to make it work. other than these two irritations this game is fantastic and worth a get.
B00138H0H4|5.0|I first heard her singing the title song of this album.  I bought this album and I love every song on it.  I am a fan for life.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|When reading the book, I could not put it down! The passion, romance, and heat, made it an unstoppable page turner! I hated it ended so quickly!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Riveting game. Having fun so far. I wish there were more games like this for kindle fire. Five stars by me.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I like it b/c it's awesome to watch him think through the process.  Have to admit that when he gets stuck and asks for help that I don't really want to give it back.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|Loved it.  The movie managed to make all parties look ridiculous.  Ironically, I think Matt Damon ended up looking the smartest.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Like to play it on the easy level and then race the clock.  That way I can get a game in here and there and it doesn't take much time.
0446693804|5.0|I loved this book.  It is such a good read.  I cried as I always do this his books.  I really enjoyed this one!
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|There are numerous versions of F. W. Murnau's classic Dracula film in circulation but this is the best and most complete that I have found.  This one runs 94 minutes, 30 minutes longer than other versions.  I even have a VHS tape I held on to because it uses the original Bram Stoker \\"Dracula\\" character names on the intertitles.  After Stoker's widow won a legal battle against the production company, the film was ordered destroyed.  Fortunately copies were found.  When the film was ultimately released, names were changed.  Count Orlok for Count Dracula, Hutter for Harker and so on.  This package includes 2 discs.<br /><br />Disc 1 is a fully restored version of the film using several different prints found over the ages.  For the most part, the result is remarkably good.  In some cases, small pieces of film were barely salvageable however.  This disc has newly translated English intertitles.  The film is colorized which was a common practice at the time.  With scene and mood changes, colors change along with it.  Most prominent is the sepia tone but we also get shades of green, blue and red as well as the B & W standard.<br /><br />Modern day film watchers will certainly chuckle at the acting, but again this was a developing art form.  Actors were accustomed to overly dramatized actions, gestures and facial contortions for live theater.  If you're not used to watching silent movies this will take some time to get over.  There are remarkable examples of great filmmaking however that are worth noting.  I was really impressed with the editing.  There are situations where numerous events are taking place at the same time.  Hutter escapes Orlok's castle and travels back to his home.  At the same time evil Orlok is crossing the Black Sea to take residence across from Hutter's house.  And institutionalized Knock is capturing flies and spiders while lovely Ellen falls under Orlok's distant spell.  The cuts are well placed and nearly seamless, especially for a movie of this generation.<br /><br />Murnau shot the film in Berlin and other German towns as well as Slovakia.  Set in 1838 in Bremen, the exterior shots in particular are well done.  Murnau's visual style certainly influenced many to follow.  Orlok's physical appearance today is also worthy of a chuckle or two but I suspect it frightened many at the time.  For another take on this creepy look, you might want to watch Werner Herzog's 1978 remake \\"Nosferatu.\\"  It's a bit slow but true Dracula lovers should like it.  You can also see some of Murnau's visual style in Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" from 1992 which I believe is the best of all films based on Dracula.<br /><br />Another excellent feature in this package is the reconstructed Hans Erdmann score performed by the Saarbrucken Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Berndt Heller.  It adds a solid foundation for the film throughout.  It comes in stereo or Dolby Surround 5.1.  The DVD package includes a second disc.  Although I did not watch it from beginning to end, the only difference I could determine was that it uses the original German language intertitles which can be supplemented with subtitles.  Disc 1 also includes a 52 minute documentary about Murnau with a focus on Nosferatu showing some original sets compared to how they look today.  Interesting stuff.  There is a short documentary on how the film restoration took place, some scene comparisons, a photo gallery and finally, excerpts from several other Murnau films.  Whew!  Yeah, get it.eneration.<br /><br />Murnau shot the film in Berlin and other German towns as well as Slovakia.  Set in 1838 in Bremen, the exterior shots in particular are well done.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|My Mom loves this cd and I gave it to her for Christmas and she plays it EVERY DAY IN HER CAR !!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|A lot slower read than the first two books, but an okay read.  I kept wanting the character to mature emotionally past being a teenager but that only happens at the very end.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|The cutting piece went together easy enough by following the directions.  However, I guess I am still on the learning curve for a smooth score on the glass.  Went thru 6 bottles and still didn't get an absolute smooth cut all the way around.  Its hard for me to make a continous non stop turn of the bottle.  Practice makes perfect I guess.  Time to get a few more wine bottles!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|It is the embodiment of life being the journey if not the goal. A well-scripted story with very good acting and scenery. Highly recommended.
B001992NUQ|5.0|I love this movie, and it was great getting to see it in Blu-ray. There were things in the film that I didn't notice before, just because the quality was good. The extra stuff that came along with it was pretty awesome, too. The movie is good, and it's pretty close to the book.

B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This soundtrack is -amazing-. And the price that I got it for was even better. The soundtrack is beautiful to listen to. I have actually sat and listened to it on repeat multiple times. The music is soothing, and it's nice to have some instrumental stuff to listen to. The couple of songs that are sung are great, too. Having been a huge Hobbit fan since childhood, this was a nice thing to have.

B006DRVFRQ|4.0|There's a small amount of a learning curve involved for using this on the Kindle, but in general it works much better than the iPod version I used awhile back.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Its a great story for describing the difficulty of breaking away from an abusive relationship. I hope it encourages women all over to gather their courage and get out of those types of situations or seek safe avenues in your community. I don't know where Nicholas  Sparks got his idea for the book but he probably knew or knew of someone ina similar situation.Its more than just a love story. You'll not be able to put it down.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Dame Judi Dench is just wonderful, I absolutely loved the sequence and could go on and on but there is always an end
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Our grandson just celebrated his 8th birthday.  This item was on his wish list.  We were able to get it for him and he was thoroughly delighted.  He put it together slowly and enjoys playing with it.  Now he is saving up for more pieces to accompany it.  The instructions were great and he paced himself with its completion.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I really like to use this calendar; have not yet found out the secret how to synchronize it to my computer; I like to use it on my Kindle Fire, very handy because I don't have to look for a pencil to write - except be careful to keep the tablet charged
B0013UIUBC|5.0|A favorite in my house.  The story is great, even if it is a bit sad at the outset. The acting is good.  Music is good. I don't know what more you would want.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I was looking for something fun to play that wasn't violent, etc. This game is lots of fun and offers enough challenge to keep my brain engaged.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My wife's favorite series, we both are hooked on this show and we are waiting impatiently on season four release. I purchased seasons 1 & 2 for my wife this Christmas and we both enjoyed a two day marathon of Downton Abbey. We were pleased to see Amazon was offering season 3 this January 2013, I ordered the Blu -ray dvd and I received my copy on the release date ( thanks Amazon).  We began another marathon watching of Downton Abbey series 3. We would recommend this series to anyone who has seen Downton Abbey series 1 & 2, buy all three series and watch it in Blu-ray. If you have'nt seen Downton Abbey buy all three series in Blu-ray, have plenty of snacks on hand and be prepared for a marathon of great tv! I gave this five stars did'nt have snacks included, would've given six stars!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was a wonderful story about a very dark chapter in history.  I learned a lot about the German Airman and surprised to find out there were those who flew with honor.
B003L77G38|5.0|This is the best show ever- we watched it on cable but it was out of order so we broke down and bought all of seasons 1-4 and will buy the final season 5 too.  the package came in great shape, on time and is just perfect.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I loved it! Watched it with my husband and we laughed a lot. I highly recommend it! Loved fat Amy!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was good but it did not have enough comedy and was not like many of the others. But good.
0670019933|5.0|Kerouac delivers with this roaming tale of buddhism, love, sex, wine, nature and joy. Another chapter of his life in what is probably his second best well known book.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|controls are too slow.  Became bored after 30 seconds.  I got it as the free app of the day and I feel like I was ripped off.
B007PBKG5G|3.0|I like the artist but the sound quality is poor particularly on the first (hit) song sounds like static the last minute  or so of the song.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great Show! We are really enjoying it! The quality is excellent and we are getting hooked on the characters. Can't wait to watch season 3.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Nice charge case for Legend. Gives you a safe place to store/charge your bluetooth headset and with the included 24&#34; USB to micro USBcharge cable it gives Legend owners an added way to charge headset via case alone, USB to micro USB on the charge case or plug USB to micro USB charge cable into the USB port on the Legend 110volt wall power charge unit.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Great program, great performances...and what a band! Be sure to notice all of the unusual instruments, and keep an eye out for the piano being played using mallets.<br /><br />The program covers material from Paul's, Simon and Garfunkle days, right up to his latest album release. But, if you're expecting 'cookie cutter' arrangements of these old songs, you'll have to look elsewhere. The new instrumentation and aggangements here, make these great old songs brand new again, and better than ever.<br /><br />It's difficult for me to believe that Paul Simon is in his 7th decade ( I recall his 'Old Friends' lyrics: '... how terribly strange to be seventy ...'), he's never performed better and the band is as tight as a drum. NOTHIN' BUT NET!<br /><br />Others in this forum, complained about sound quality. Here's what I heard:<br /><br />DVD sound is crisp and clean but imaging was only narrow stereo, almost monophonic. My video system still uses a Dolby Matrix surround system, circa 1980's. With this DVD, my rear channels produced low level ambient sounds, only. Normally, with stereo or 5.1 surround programs, the rear signals are strong and quite effective...I rather like the effect. However, that effect was almost non existent with this DVD. In fact, I actually thought the sound was monophonic... even with my usual 7 foot seperation between speakers.<br /><br />CD sound was warmer and less detailed. I think CD sound engineering might have been hurried, however, the stereo sound stage and imaging was far better on the CD than on the DVD.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give both the CD sound and the DVD sound 2 1/2 stars each, but for different reasons. Nevertheless, both get 5 stars for music, performance and enjoyment.<br /><br />I listened to the CD's before I watched the DVD, That was a mistake. While I enjoyed the music only program, I look forward to listening again. Now that I watched the singer and the band perform, I'll truly appreciate what I'll be hearing!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I gave this app 5 stars because it is a great way to have Gods word with you all the time. Easy to use and easy to share Love it
B00992CF6W|1.0|It might be OK, But I cannot figure out how to load it on my granddaughters ematic tablet.  Thank you.  After about a month, one day it just started working, crazy.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|After all the hype about this book, I finally purchased it for my kindle. I was disappointed, to say the least. First of all, it was quite imature, and repetitive. Eg...Blushing, eye rolling etc....silly and shallow all round. I should have saved my money, and purchased a real story, not this Empty story.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite all-time books.  It caught me from the very beginning.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an emotional, gripping story.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like the fact that you can title the notebooks for different subjects. Choosing your own pictures for the covers would be a nice addition.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Keeps you guessing til the very end of the book.<br />Couldn't put it down- look forward to reading more from Gillian Flynn
0321356683|3.0|This is a very good book teaching how to program Java effectively. It is a little bit out-dated as it refers to Java 1.5 very frequently, but we are in Java 7 now. I hope the author can update it to Java 7 with all new Java features explained in the same approach.
B00004RCLW|5.0|I am not now nor have ever been a huge Talking Heads fan however this concert is genious on so many levels.  Byrne and the band don't relay on tricks or gimmics but provide an Organic audio-video extravanza that's refreshing by any standards.  My only nit-pick complaint is the order of songs in that 2 of the songs with the most impact were both played near the beginning.  But perhaps that's merely my personal take.
B005XBKXV2|5.0|Excellent sound and audio production of Disney's timeless classic!!  I loved it and there is nothing I can complain about. Get at and watch it any time!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, could hardly put it down. If the first few pages capture my interest  know I will it will be a great read.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Thank God for men like Chris Kyle who stand the line and provide the blanket of freedom we sleep under.  Too many times as Americans we forget what freedom really means and the great sacrifices that are made by our warriors to keep us free.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book was difficult to get into but once you get over all the history of people and places it gets interesting and hard to put down. Hang in there until about page 70 and then it gets good.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Didn't finish it and from what a friend tells me about how it ended, I'm glad I didn't.  I found myself disliking all the characters as it went on, and the story became more and more unlikely.  Very dark in tone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I KNEW WHAT THIS STORY INVOLVED WHEN I WAS ONLY A FEW CHAPTERS INTO IT - BUT I KEPT READING, HOPING THAT ULTIMATELY TRUE LOVE WOULD PREVAIL.  I WAS ALSO IMPRESSED WITH THE EPILOG, AS IT GIVES YOU INSIGHT INTO THE STORY FROM CHRISTIAN'S POINT OF VIEW; ALLOWING YOU UNDERSTAND JUST HOW HE GREW TO BE THE MAN HE BECAME.  GREAT THINKING ON THE AUTHOR'S PART!  ALSO I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT FIRST (SECOND AND THIRD) AT WRITING FROM THIS NEW AUTHOR!  AS AN ASPIRING AUTHOR MYSELF, MS. JAMES' STORY IS CERTAINLY INSPIRING.  THEY SAY YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WRITE ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW......HMMMMM.  NOT JUDGING HERE, BUT SHE TREATED CHRISTIAN'S OBSESSION AS TASTEFULLY AS IT COULD BE HANDLED CONSIDERING THE SUBJECT MATTER, BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE ANYONE COULD WRITE ABOUT THIS SUBJECT MATTER WITHOUT AT LEAST SOME FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|definitely on the weird side, this movie was however such a pleasant surprise. best movie i've seen in many months. highly recommended!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The last book was great, but it didn't end the way I had expected. Honestly, I don't know why Collins would choose to kill off one of the central characters. Katniss was a bit of a wuss, but she did have to deal with alot of bs though. I liked who she picked at the end though, that was cute. Overall the book series was good, but the idea was taken from previous works and executed better (like George Orwell's 1984). Which is why I can't give it a five star rating. I enjoyed reading another great series, however.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I thought this was a good romance read. I love all the cheesy romance novels :) so this one makes the list.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Couldn't be happier with the movie or Amazon rental experience!  Streaming, purchase price, and actual movie were fantastic.  Highly recommend!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it and yes addictive. I could not stop watching it till I was done.I will be waitng on Four.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Unexpectedly good movie.  Branagh's adaptation of the Norse legend is captivating.  I don't usually think much of super hero movies as I tend to think of them as more suited for children's stories, or comic book material (and I do love comics), but this movie exceeded my expectations in almost every way.  I am a fan of Kenneth Branagh but was unaware until after watching that he had directed it.  Well done sir.<br />Anthony Hopkins was superb as Odin.
1616550414|5.0|This is an absolutely incredible source for all things in the Legend of Zelda universe! The book itself is wonderfully heavy, and does not disappoint on the information and art concepts included! The timeline (although leaked online) looks wonderful in print, as does all the various assets assigned to each game in the series to date. I look forward to revisiting these games now that I have this incredible retrospective look on them, and I would absolutely recommend it for any fan of Link (or however you choose to name him) and his numerous iterations!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book!! Couldn't put it down! I could read thus over and over again! Definitely recommending to everyone!
B0000AUHPK|4.0|A timely receipt of a great class that I will use in my class.  Thanks for your help with this.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|Season 2 does not compare to Season 1, but overall was a great season. It answered questions and opened up new ones and really began to build on the story that was set-up in Season 1.  I may be one of the few people that really enjoyed the introduction of the Tailies though I was disappointed to see Libby leave the show so quickly, especially after an intriguing glimpse into her past.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|It is an enjoyable series that is easy to watch. There are many stories to follow and variations that keep you wanting to watch more. Long introduction at the beginning gets old.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is pretty fun to play. It takes a while to play, but it is a pretty addictive game. The graphics for the game are amazing. I would highly recommend this app for anybody.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|An incredible read, this book amazed me with its detail, depth and thought. Max Brooks has used amazing insight to formulate an international story, setting World War Z apart from traditional zombie stories by not limiting itself to a single location or group of people but instread bringing together stories from across the world to show the range of experience and the course of a zombie epidemic. Brooks masterfully creates multiple unique voices which match the individual people recounting their experiences and sharing the varied global response - from China to America, India to Russia, Israel to South Africa and even to the international space station. The interwoven stories of World War Z form a great narrative and a fast moving read. The only disappointment of the book were some details which were hinted at and never fully explored and a lack of closure on some stories. All up this book is so well written and so accurate in language, tone and context that it is easy to forget you are reading a fictional story.
B000056VJ7|5.0|I've always liked a few of the songs on this CD, so I just went ahead and bought it for myself.
0062073486|5.0|I loved the book and then there were none.......it's great for people who like mystery books,it keeps your mind wondering until the end
B007PS0DTI|5.0|This movie kept right in line with the other moviees. It explains the blanks, not leaving you wondering where did this come from or why is this happening. We will watch again.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I first saw this a year ago on Disney Channel asia and fell in love with it. It really saddens me that people would give this a one star only because the dvd won't work. I also saw some comments that said they are confused. But for me, it wasn't really that confusing. Maybe it's because I'm Asian too or maybe I've watched and read animes and mangas for a long time that I can understand their culture. One thing that I noticed is that this movie is for ages 5 and above. I must say that this is not for 5 year-old children. Hayao Miyazaki himself stated that this is for children who are 10 years old or above.% year olds won't be able to understand what happens in this movie.
B004X75RK4|5.0|It is great to see how the mighty can fall. They take us from a mutual hateish relationship to a I love and need you relationship. Great movie, we will watch it again!
B000001FSU|5.0|Actually my first Anthrax album and honestly i liked it more than Among the Living (which is still a great album) it gives some great riffs and the drums are amazing.
B002X4OKRK|4.0|I like the Willy Woka version a lot better, but this is good. I will watch it again when in the mood.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This helped me to find the camera which is hidden on the kindle. If it has a camera and record then why would amazon hide that. This should be fixed ASAP because i endjoy using my camera.
B00B7G3Y4U|5.0|This part of the paranormal series was by far the best of all of them. This keeps you wondering and waiting for what is next. We would watch again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts out very easy and quick.  I found myself doing &quot;just a few more&quot; and then it started to get more challenging.  Currently stuck on an 8x8 that has me baffled but I don't want to use the hints just yet.  I look forward to the speed play mode. Fun!
B0049J0CTM|3.0|I really didn't care for this movie, my 15 year old loves it the 3 years old could care less about it. I guess you would have to see for yourself, but I will not watch it again.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Sometimes the lightness threatens to float away like a champagne bubble, but I relaxed and let the insistent wistfulness of a hero who is ever the optimist, ever truthful, and never one to over think the seemingly impossible realities he confronts offer me a sense of peace and a smile to face the challenges of life. Ultimately much enjoyed and appreciated.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book held my attention thru the entire book...  I found it was really hard for me to put it down...  puts a different spin on that time in history...
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A well-written analysis of the life and struggles of the introvert. Very validating! Will recommend it to all my friends.
0345803507|5.0|Love this collection of books. It's more than steamy sex.  It's Suspense, Romance and Drama.  It made my recovery from surgery a whole lot less painful.  Could not put any of these books down.  I wish there were more books of Christian and Ana coming!
0786958731|5.0|I can play this with my 6 and 9 year old boys.  The 9 year old was definitely interested in learning the rules and figuring out the game.  After some practice, the 6 year old knew the phases of the turns and was able to have fun, too.  I wouldn't go much younger than 6 though.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Had to return season 2 as I don't have a blueray DVD player but ,thankfully, was able to stream season 2
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very entertaining and keeps you coming back. The graphics are beautiful and the games are fun. Keeps my little one happy too.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Good movie, I'm a fan of the director and his other movies. This is one of his best movies.  The worst of his movies was the one on the train which seemed like 20 hours,  that one was so bad I can't even remember the name of it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game....my husband thinks I may have a problem. I play it a lot! they need gamers anonymous. love it when does 3 come out.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Well, If you haven't seen it, then go watch it! If you have seen it, watch it again! Save Ferris Bueller!
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Movie has stuck with me like no other. Such a modest man. Amazing that he went so long without realizing how popular he was in South Africa.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|I have to totally disagree with the reviewer that said this set is way overpriced.  Yes, this set is expensive but I think it is totally in line with what Lego prices are today.  This is the biggest set I have gotten, its larger size justifies the $50 price increase from the other two Lego Modular Buildings I own, the [[ASIN:B002O064J0 LEGO Creator Fire Brigade 10197]] and [[ASIN:B0033PSLUK LEGO Creator Grand Emporium 10211]], which both MSRP at $150. The Town Hall has 2766 pieces and 8 minifigures, the Grand Emporium has 2182 pieces and 7 minifigures and the Fire Brigade has 2231 pieces and 4 minifigues, the Town Hall as almost 25% more pieces than the Brigade and but the price went up less than 25%.<br /><br />I am not saying I didn't get this on sale, I just think that the $199 suggested price is on par with how much Lego's cost.<br /><br />I am excited about expanding my modular buildings collection and getting the Palace Cinema, which just came out, and I still have not gotten the [[ASIN:B004P2HMNM LEGO Creator Pet Shop 10218]] either, I am still sad I missed out on the Green Grocer.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It is very fun but we don't like the gas part. It very easy to use and I love the baby part.
B0091REZMW|4.0|My mom in law has this free app on her Ipad.  Tried it and it was ok.  Seems to take a long time to level up and the game is pretty monotonous at lower levels.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Liked the story and the actors - didn't need the &#34;f&#34; word.<br />Wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anyone.<br />Just my personal opinion.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Bright and pretty graphics.  Mindless and easy.  I play it every night.  Free entertainment.  What more do you want in life?
B00915G6MG|5.0|Please let me know when season 11 is available! I have watched all the episodes 1-10 and I was never let down.  It is a great show
B008RTE08E|5.0|How is a band that is literally half dead creating new product?  I don't know.  My husband is a fan and as long as they keep putting it out, he gets it.  or I get it for him as a gift.  Win-win either way
0151008116|3.0|I think it would be a better movie than a book.  It is the first book I read that I thought would be better than the book.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have this on my kindle, phone and laptop.  Not sure if I'm doing it right.  Certainly is not user friendly.  Love the idea, but frustrated when my note did not get from my computer to my phone when I needed it to.  Probably user error.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Once I saw the movie, I knew I had to get his albums.  I have since turned a number of people on to his music.  It's a great album.
B00632HWOG|5.0|HOw great to be able to catch up on email on my little kindle.  While I'm &#34;with&#34; my husband watching HIS shows, I can zone out and check out the latest!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I thought this book was going to be another bad try of fifty shades....Wow was I wrong!! This book captivated me from the beginning....Sky and holder are/could be the next Bella n Edward!!
B000HZD168|5.0|Fun and exciting! old fashion action adventure with the Star Trek crew!  some plot twists as well.  - a fan
B005K17RU0|5.0|Just what the title says: helpful information, especially when traveling because you can track multiple cities.. Highly recommend this app for anyone.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|With so many Oscar nominations and Hollywood stars you'd think this movie is worth watching but it's difficult to watch sometimes.  Some of the vulgar scenes seem out of place and not related to the storyline.  It's also confusing as they move beyond the main characters.  Laura Dean seems lost in the film.  What was her relationship with the Master?  There is not enough back story to fill you in. Amy Adams seems miscast as the wife of the Master.  J. Phoenix seems crazy as ever but without a redeeming reason to continue to watch. There are much better movies that every one of these great stars have been in without all the awful acting. The relationship to L. Ron Hubbard seems justified - for as much as I know about his life.
B005SFR7YE|3.0|It is not the actual show but a concert... I think you better skip this item. Waste of money as I see it
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Very entertaining but not the years best picture IMHO. Great time piece picture for the 70's and 80's. My wife like it.
1616550414|5.0|FINALLY an English version of Miyamoto's Zelda &#34;encylopedia&#34;.  If you grew up following the Legend of Zelda, you must have this.  Great coffee table book.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|Super cute game and fun to play, and every 100 coins you get another life. So I was up to about 30 lives. Then on the start of level 3-1 Lep is placed to start too far off of the level so you fall the moment the level play starts. Did all I could to try and jump or move but I just kept dying the instant it started. A huge dissapointment! How could they miss a bug as simple as that, you can't even play the level (or continue further into the game for that matter.)
1575666286|5.0|Even if you don't have cancer or any degenerative disease, think of this as a \\"preventative care\\". Our health system is build on \\"disease treatment\\". We should start thinking rather \\"preventative care\\", than to search for solutions after we get sick. The Gerson Therapy is a gateway to help your body heal itself.<br /><br />My mom was diagnosed with Shy-Drager Syndrome, a rare Multiple System Atrophy disorder. With the help of Gerson Therapy and another nature's miracle, a herbal blend called Protandim was our answer to our prayers. Protandim is nothing more than a synergistic natural herbal blend of Milk Thistle, Turmeric, Bacoba, Green Tea extract and Ashwaganda. It triggers your body at cellular level to heal itself by naturally increasing the production of certain healing enzymes and boosting your immune system. This amazing natural supplement and the Gerson Therapy has been the blessing we have been searching for.<br /><br />But like I said, even if you are not sick, you should see this combination as a great way to prevent any illness and slow the degenerating aging process at the cellular level.<br /><br />This book is a must buy for everyone - and if you like to check out herbal blend I have mentioned, I highly recommend that too. Check it out at DefyCellularAging dot com.
B00377V6J2|5.0|Enough people have extolled this amazing recording's virtues that it isn't necessary for me to add my 2 cents - the set is absolutely phenomenal. It transcends the genre and stands as a testament to the sublime power of the creative human spirit. Not to be missed by even casual fans of inspired music.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Great series can't wait for the new one to start!!! A real attention getter!!  The possibilities are endless. Get a 5in my book!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|my eleven year old is a minecraft junkie and is enjoying the pocket edition. sometimes he's frustrated with the limitations but then I remind him that he's playing minecraft IN THE CAR!
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|So Myself and the family sit down to watch this movie...let me just say that their should sleep bag disclaimer...lol nobody would leave the room or turn the lights off.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|this was the only diary of a wimpy kid book that our family had not read yet. my son read it on his kindle in 2 days! good stuff!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great brain teaser puzzle game! Once you start playing you can't stop. They get harder and harder as you go, really makes you think.
B005HSL626|4.0|this is a good game for spending time while waiting for something or someone else. my eleven year old is the number one user of this app!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|All the songs on this cd has meaning for me! Adele has a way of transfering her emotions over to the listener! Sincerely and honestly! Love her voice, her music and her delivery of every note!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|great adventure to watch with the kids, it looks sooo real!!! Cant wait til the next one, hope they create one for the next treasure experience.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|We were having problems with our network and used this app to help us determine where the problem might be. It provided some much needed reference at the time.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|well I really like it! its fun to build stuff ya know? but&hellip; not enough time. I try to build a house and I don't even get time to finish it. and we cant go back to it after to continue! you have to buy it :/ cool but I don't recommend it if you try to build something that takes time. lol.k
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This app does what it's supposed to do but I had trouble getting it to work when my wi-fy was OFF for a week.  It seemed as it it wanted to search for ads and wouldn't start until I turned wi-fy back on once we got home.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Can't wait for the next 007 movie and I watch it from amazon in my own home with famely and friends
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I’d already had the Abe Lincoln VS zombies – so went in sort of expecting the same but was surprised at how well made this was.  I guess studio baking DOES work for some films.  The whole concept, I know, seems outlandish – but the story played well as he gravitates towards the Presidency as he gets older and the acting and effects were very good.  Some of the fight scenes used the “Matrix” approach with the slow motion but it was used well.  Just a fun film and others here have already given you the play by play – and it has plenty of re-watch value for me so, was glad I picked it up.  If you want to wait for the price to drop, please do, but I easily suggest picking this one up
B000WN60NG|2.0|The guitar duel at the end is the only reason to watch this movie at all.  Not a family flick at all.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|Once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down. This authour is truly gifted, every word leaps off the page and keeps you absorbed into the story.It is unlike any other story I have read, the plot is very original, and the end will make you reflect on your life.

B000WAGVHE|5.0|This Movie Was Alot Of Fun Recommend This To All Was A Great Film Reminded Me Of The Greese Days. John Tavolta Was Excellent And Funny To See Him Play The Role Of  A Woman. Michelle Pfheiffer Was Great As Well And Christopher Walken Was Good Too. Overal  Give Tis Movie An A+ In My Book Of Great Films. Well The Movie Was About A Girl Who Dreams To Be On Tv. A Singing Star And Finally Gets Her Wish Queen Latifah as Out Standing The Language Was Out Of Sinc But For That Erra In Time Thats How They Spoke. So You Do Hear The Word Yes That The (N Word Negro ) In the film Quite A Bit But It Was A Great Film Besides That.
B00933JF74|4.0|Medieval SIM city is the closest thing to call it. You manage your town funds and happiness. You put your villagers to work making your town come to life. Very easy controls and a well cover tutorial. The music is nice too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun but be careful you can get addicted. I love it so much. You can dodge trains. Jumps railroad shoppers etc.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to read the second book based on some of the other reviews.  Glad I did - good character development and now into the third book.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|I don't like writing a lot in a review but these reveiws make you. It is a good game just needs to be a little more challenging.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved the character and story development woven cleverly into an accurate depiction of history with detail of everyday life not normally found.
0316123587|5.0|it's a good collection book for glee fan's.<br />It's a very colourful book with a lot of photos.<br />would recommend it to any fan
0143118757|5.0|This is a great book that I would recommend for any leadership courses!  I used this book for several of my leadership courses.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I am 80% thru this book, enjoying quirky way the writer describes and puts you in the mind of Sky's thoughts and interactions with her close friend Six and lover Holden. Light reading book
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can say that I never enjoyed a tv series more than  Downton Abbey.  As others have said , this series is well-acted and the plots and sub-plots are never ending.  I can't stop watching and just bought the book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is nothing like I have ever read, it touches your heart in places that have never been touched and takes you through a new perspective of life.
B00AHXDECG|3.0|The price was hard to beat so I caved. Not bad at all. Love the track When I Was Your Man.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I truly like this game because you can build your dream city but it sucks a little because the game takes so long
B001BKM3MQ|5.0|I love this slow, jazzy, folksy music and John Mayer has it down. Love listening to this and thinking about my hubs :)
B000063UR2|5.0|I originally saw the theatrical version of the film first and absolutely loved it, then I saw the director's cut. I fell in love with the first version I saw, but the director's cut was terrible. It had a lot of useless scenes that did not need to be in the film, like Lily's singing. Many reviews say that the theatrical version doesn't make sense, but the plot is super easy to follow and in my opinion a lot better. The director's cut just adds 20 extra minutes of scenes that aren't needed to follow the plot. Whatever version of Legend you like, it is pure magic and a perfect fantasy movie. Legend Ultimate Edition is awesome, it has both the director's cut and the theatrical version. I love everything about the DVD set, it's a must have if you love Legend.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Bob Marley. Do I really need to say more? Oh yeah..I do, according to Amazon. One of my favorite artists!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|My husband and I LOVE all aspects for movies, from directing to writing to editing to sound and then down to acting.  We are definite cinema folk.  However this movie was WAY too over-the-top for us.  My husband kept nodding off and I kept hoping it would get better.  Joaquin Phoenix is amazing, as usual, and Amy Adams is great.  But other than the individual performances, we found this move to be a big mess.  I'm not a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson (didn't like Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, Magnolia), but I was hoping I'd like this film.  Evidently I need to just stay away from his movies altogether.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|I was sorry to come to the end of the, I think, 12 episodes following Francis Urquehart's rise to prime minister.  A very, very British, very intelligent and well scripted series. I wish there were more like it.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I've used both Shazam and Soundhound for a year. Both are excellent, free apps and the which one is better debate is pointless to me. Use them both. I have found that Shazam consistently IDs more songs of different genres than Soundhound. Also being able to list all the songs playing in a movie or TV show after it listens to 15 seconds of dialogue is just magically delicious. If you hear a song on a show, but can't get the phone and open the app right away, just use it anytime before the program/movie is over and you'll see the song listed and approx. how long ago it was playing.<br />I also find the sharing function much speedier and more direct than Soundhound.<br />Soundhound gets the edge in seeing more info about the song and the lyrics at first glance. Also props for making it easy to look up a song and to find songs you tagged more quickly at a later time.<br />But as I said, just have both side by side and you can't go wrong.

B008NNA6OG|5.0|Merry and delightful musical with sublime dancing by Kelly and O'Connor.  Amusing story with great comedic acting by Jean Hagen.  &#34;Singin in the Rain&#34; is the best loved piece but I've always appreciated Donald O'Connor's &#34;Make 'em Laugh&#34;.  The script is full of delightful one-liners.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love Pinterest! I am really happy I finally have it available on my kindle fire! Before my link was only a fast button to the website but wasn't fully functional the way this is, thank you!

B0040I09RM|5.0|A bit bloody and graphic at times, but the characters really pull you in.  I am into season 2 at present.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is Austen at her best.  This classic never gets stale no matter how many times I read it. Great story, fascinating characters and wonderful descriptions of English society and class differences. You just can't go wrong with Jane Austen.
B0079TQHDO|2.0|Book 3 of the Chronicles is actually quite good but by the time you get to it you have read Volumes 1 and 2.  However I do wonder if anyone who has read Archer's `As the Crow Flies' needs to read the first two volumes of the Chronicle.  The plot is sufficiently similar that maybe just a cross reference of the character names would enable many of the readers to go straight to Volume 3.  Of course there are differences but there is sufficient similarity that within about 20 pages of Volume 1, but it might be a bit more, the basic plot development is very familiar.  This means that many of the twists that occur in Books 1 and 2 are not a surprise at all, which really does disappoint.  It is sad that such a well known author should very nearly plagiarise the themes of his own work.  It is not until Book 3 that he moves the fundament story into a different area.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My grandson said I really needed to play this game, so of course I downloaded it.  It is fun and not too challenging.
0345404475|5.0|Philip K. Dick was a true visionary, mad towards the end like many other visionaries. His books are pigeon-holed as 'Science Ficition', but I agree with the alternative genre description of 'Psy-Fi', for, like the author Morton Bain, his books explore consciousness more than interplanetary realms. Read this and all his other books!
B00BHMF578|4.0|Entertaining movie about an specific group of people in a difficult situation, i like that most of the time the movie focus on these people and doesn't try to much to delve in the politics of Iranian people and Canada. The focus in the group is a greater way of conveying tension in my mind. The thing i don't like, is that is that it does feel too pro american and pro Hollywood.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This book was a little boring at first.  Once I started to learn the characters and the way of speech it, it became quite interesting.  I enjoyed how the narrator explores the characters personalities and is sympathetic each one's experiences.
1451695195|2.0|The book is composed of three subjects:  His illness, his family, his OBE.  The thought of arriving in heaven was not detailed enough and in fact was washed over very lightly, with mostly how he got the illness he had and his families reactions to him being ill.  There have been better compositions of \\"Is there a heaven?\\" Try another book first.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|A compelling if difficult to watch story about alcohol and drug addiction. In-air sequences were authentic and riveting and as always Washington brings depth to a character living with a lot of pain.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|John Cleese is a legend and one of the best comedic actors of all time. Fawlty Towers is a must have for any fan of British Comedies. It is such a hilarious show. You will laugh at every episode

B005WTR4ZI|4.0|This book is a well-researched account of the profoundly disruptive effects that digital technology has had on the labor market. It examines how computers and networks have created (and continue to create) vast numbers of losers and an ever shrinking pool of winners. It draws upon examples to show how a large part of the stagnation in median wages, the increasing concentration of wealth and the jobless recovery can be attributed to the tremendous improvements in information systems.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|The struggles of middle class living are made so very clear in this novel. Franzen correctly observes why money is not the solution to solving these problems.
B009EJSUBY|5.0|In 1958 when he won the fabled Tchaikovsky Competition, I was 14.  That is the year I \\"found\\" classical music in a way that has stuck for all the years since.  My Dad brought home the mono version of the Tchaikovsky concerto which we played the heqq out of on the old Magnavox Radio-Phonograph.  Since then I have owned thousands of classical recordings -- but his was the first.<br /><br />Van Cliburn's funeral was yesterday in Ft. Worth and I bought this collection today (the day after).  I have owned or heard all of these recordings before, but I will, nevertheless, treasure this one as his memorial.<br /><br />A few years ago my wife and I attended a concert in Ft. Worth of John Williams (of Star Wars fame) conducting his music with the Ft. Worth Symphony.  Early in the concert, Mr. Williams acknowledged his friend, Van Cliburn, who was there that night.  He then told a short anecdote:  \\"You know, Van and I both attended Juliiard.  We were room mates.  I had come to Julliard as a piano major.  After I heard Van play, I changed my major to composition....\\"<br /><br />The historical record of the past 55 years will show that Mr. Cliburn quietly changed a lot of lives.  Like George Bailey in Capra's movie, who knows what might have happened without him?  We do know that the 10,000 warheads that the US and Soviet Union had pointed at each other were never launched.  We also know that Mr. Cliburn may have been the most effective ambassador to the Soviet Union that we ever had...he went there many many times.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, and he could play the piano, too.  Back in 1958 Dad read the Time Magazine article to us which said something like, \\"He has the technique of Horowitz and the charisma of Elvis Presely....\\"  Fifty-tive years later we can add, \\"He had the heart of Van Cliburn.\\"<br /><br />====================<br /><br />Since writing my original piece, I have received the set from Amazon and listened to all of it. It occurs to me that I did not buy this set to get the last-word performance of any one of it's approx 230 tracks. Rather I bought it as a souvenir of a great musician and to hear what he had to say on a large cross-section of piano music. Among these performances are great ones and there are some that are less than great but totally acceptable and musically defensible. He doesn't distort and he never becomes distasteful With any great pianist -- Horowitz, Rubinstein, Richter, et. al -- if I bought an complete set of their recordings I'd expect to get some great performances and some acceptable ones. So Cliburn is no different than they are in that respect.<br /><br />As to the actual package, it is beautifully done. There is a hard-cover booklet describing the dates of the release of each album. Each disk is pressed to resemble an RCA Red Seal black vinyl record, and the album covers, artwork and commentary (if you can find a magnifying glass to read it) are all original. They are all put together in a handsome archive box.<br /><br /> I'm getting a little tired of the condescending comments, of some,  on the sound of Sony's vintage releases -- \\"pretty good for the '60's\\" as if our digital counterparts were all so good. Frankly, I think the Living Stereo producers/engineers gave us better, more natural, and more balanced sound than we get these days. The delivery systems -- in the form of CDs and SACDs may be better, today. But the masters, in some cases, aren't. We have no reason to be chauvinistic about the quality of sound coming out today -- on average. This set -- and others that Sony has given us of the same vintage -- has nothing to apologize for when it comes to sound quality.the last-word performance of any one of it's approx 230 tracks.

B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Basically a waste of time and talent. Nothing to root for in any of the characters; the main character, played by Phoenix, so twisted that you could care less whether he lives or dies. Save your money.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this app is great! its not exactly like the computer version. this is the only good slender game avalible to android phones/tablets as of now... if slender rising (an IOS only game) were to make it on aneroid stores this would be forgotten I reccomend that you get it well worth the purchase.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|The quality of these is top-notch!  The gold plating is flawless, the packaging was phenominal, and the price is outstanding.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the \\"banana\\" portion of this plug does not unscrew.  I have other plugs where both the base (below the color) AND the banana unscrew, to allow for a more custom and, in my opinion, tighter fit.  However, I got used to these and managed to fit the wires in just as tight as my other ones.  I posted pics to help explain what I mean.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was an excellent film, a very interesting little piece of history centered around a conflict not given much detail or acknowledgement these days. Very well made, Ben Affleck truly deserved his Best Film Oscar.
B0091VGAXK|5.0|Having spent much of my 20s during the 80s, I LOVED the music, the costumes, the HAIR!!  I had seen the stage play (with Constantine Maroulis in the Diego Boneta's role--Constantine was better!), which I adored, so I was a bit skeptical when I heard they were making a film version.  OK, MORE than a bit skeptical, especially when I heard that Tom Cruise was playing Stacee Jaxx (I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan).  I have to say, he was INCREDIBLE.  Well done, Tom!  The film version of the story differs some from the stage version, but I didn't care.  SUPER fun movie!!!  I bought a blu-ray copy.<br /><br />The only advice I have for you is this:  Wear ear plugs during Julianne Hough's singing.  She is as cute as a bug and quite believable as the Midwest Girl coming to Hollywood to find fame and fortune, but her voice is enough to shatter glass.  SO high that, if she'd sung one more note higher, only dogs would have heard it.  Grating...made my teeth hurt.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|The touch interface greatly speeds up and simplifies accessing all those fiddly menus.  Slick design, too.  You'll want some spare batteries (like the Wasabi clones), as it does consume a fair bit of juice.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is gory, so beware.  But it is full of twists and turns, very realistic.  It is intense, and everytime the show ends, you are biting your nails waiting for the next one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game reminds me of my old graffiti days with a twist and can't get enough of it spend hours enjoying the game and the graphics the update have been better everytime ...love it
B0086700CM|3.0|I didn't find it easy to play it. Also my son said there is a problem with the app. it stops a lot
B004DSX5B6|4.0|This is a good, solid knife for the money. The blades & tools have started out a bit stiff, but I assume this will ease up. The case seemed a nice, albeit cheap accessory, which can mount horizontally on your belt, for comfort -- however, the stitching on this began unraveling after a few weeks. I wrote an email to customer service, politely expressing my disappointment. I quickly got a very courteous reply, apologizing, saying that they were mailing out another case to me immediately. Great customer service in a time when you usually can't even connect with a real person in a large company. This made a fan out of me !<br /><br />A follow-up on the fraying case - they immediatly sent a new one, but this unraveled withing days. So... the knife is very good, but forget the case. You can get an inexpensive one at the hardware store for a few bucks.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Really not sure why this one the Oscar for best picture...other than for the subject matter.  Since I knew nothing of this operation, I was intrigued to learn about it.  Acting is well done, directing well done as well, but I found it a bit hard to stay awake...in fact, I missed about 30 minutes of it because I fell asleep.  Wish I'd not paid the extra buck for HD.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|My 3 stars is a blend of a 5 up to the last few minutes of the last episode and a 1 for the over-wrought tragedy depicted for the season finale.  I have heard that the reason was due to the reluctance of the actor to return for a 4th season.  It converted what I had been enjoying as a very good, period-revealing drama into an overblown soap opera.  Amazon may have wasted some money gaining the exclusive on this for future seasons, because I may not tune in for season 4.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers Rome is great. Getting up to 400000 is really hard but u just have to use the boards
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Did not disappoint!  The much anticipated Season 3 of Downron Abbey in HD drew me in and horrified me with the ending.  Eagerly awaiting Season 4 in 2014.  I am a big fan.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|My eight years old loved this game. It has an easy format. Easy to play it, and with android app you and pacman move together to win the competition!

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|very pleased with app and has a very good price - very simple to set up - just type in a URL in desktop's browser - transfers files very quickly in both directions - took a while to find the Upload box in lower right hand corner to send files from desktop to tablet but no problems now - much easier than taking tablet apart to put micro SD card into slot on desktop computer or digging out a USB cable
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Moonshine and it's origins through the experiences of one set of famous family brothers is what this film is all about. Some of the story and roles played are sometimes stereotypical and comic-book like. The struggle of the evil, federal government and the heroic moonshiners plays to a NASCAR type of audience. Still, it was entertaining if a little too romanticized for my taste.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|It's a great collection of all of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series and very readable and so inexpensive!
B008XG1X18|4.0|i love  pinterest, i love having it on my kindle fire and my mytouch. i only wish i could search my boards or others boards. also if I could choose how to put them in order, by date, or alpha, that would be awesome.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|this is a good game for 5 years old. it is easy to play it, and it does't contain violence.
B009H5IS1W|4.0|Criminal Minds is good this year but, I don't like changes.  When people leave the show it changes everything.  I still like Criminal Minds and will order Season 8 DVD.
B008220DGE|4.0|PS Hoffman plays a man who appears to be like L. Ron Hubbard, since at least some aspects of his cult feature elements of scientology. Enter Joauquin Phoenix's character, a drifter who needs a place to belong.  The two become connected as the drama plays out.  You have to infer a lot since nothing is really spelled out here.
B00BHMF578|3.0|As good as the story was for its sheer unbelievability, this film is too cute for its own good. Good but not great.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Once again a thriller! Many surprises and plot twist. I have loved all of the Pendergast series. I can't wait for the next in the series.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I never read this as a kid, and just found it attached to my Kindle. However, the writing captured me almost immediately, and I looked forward to getting back to the story whenever I had left it. While many characters are thrown together fairly quickly, several, from the first pirate our protagonist meets to Long John Silver are full of quirks and idiosyncrasies. There is obviously plenty of action and adventure, and I was amazed at how many things in the book are still will us in further stories (especially pirate lore and the Disney movies with Jack Sparrow). Stevenson's imagination is quite wonderful, and therefore his impact today is still felt!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My son been bothering me to buy an x-box, but instead I got this game and he has forgotten his x-box. the game keeps him fascinated because it tkes him to the places he saw in the movie.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|Like this particular movie series and wanted to add this one to my collection.  Movie was a good price to pay.
B001UU75WK|5.0|This is a smart show mostly well written with interesting characters. In the era of garbage and shallowness on public media such brilliant shows are truly refreshing. Well worth the time and money spent, that is if you are not a prime member of Amazon. My only concern, not to take away from the merits of the show, is Amazon's streaming fluctuating wildly between HD and very low quality connection, probably due to congestion caused by having too many subscribers lined up surpassing the servers' capacity.
B00AO7HN8Q|5.0|Once I remember buying this record for $3.99, because it had a cut-out sleeve, but the vinyl was new. It was 1989 and was so eager to buy the first original copy of my favorite band. Later on I bought the CD - they became more popular then, and sent the record as a gift to one of my childhood buddies living overseas. I had not even been able to play it on a record player once. I was still new when I sent it. I had kept looking at it and dreaming to play it once I had a record player. I did like records more than CDs, but CDs became more secure way to keep the contents. Alas, I had my first cd player before having a record player. How bizarre the prices of those vinyls have gone up and the enthusiasm to own them is coming back. I hope my ex-buddy still keeps the record - and realizes how valuable they have become.
B0080MJYR0|4.0|Great special effects (considering there was no CGI when it was made), neat costumes and a charming performance by Jane Fonda.

B008Y6TD5A|2.0|This movie was a little slow in parts. Overall it was worth the time spent watching.  The shots of Pittsburgh in the fall were beautiful.
B00979JV00|5.0|I was unsure how I would react to this series.  It received tons of great reviews, but I didn't really understand the premise.<br /><br />After watching the first disc, I became addicted.  Interesting character development and I like the contrast between the employees and employers.
B006OAB432|5.0|This is definitely a great album. It's ultimately listenable - there's not even one song I dislike on the whole album. It's also a great, quiet pressing that has a great sleeve and comes with the CD as well.
B007OWG3LM|3.0|This is the only time I've ever had trouble with the packing of my purchased items. When removed from the large envelope in which it arrived it was bent at such an angle I was afraid the disc was broken. It wasn't and it plays fine. The cardboard case is still warped however and has not straightened out after much trying.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was a great book that I highly recommend. In many ways, I'd say it was almost flawless. Great pace. Great characters. Great plot.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|keeps kids entertained for a while.  needs more options that don't cost credits. will probably get better as levels progress.
B008NA3I30|5.0|This independent gem on the juxtoposition in relationships of love.  This film needs to be seen by more filmgoers. Making the production available in this medium will help humanity .
0143039431|5.0|I just re-read this book after many years. It was just as powerful as it was long ago.<br /><br />There are many people who fit into the pattern of the book today. History does repeat itself.<br />There were nights that I dreamed about the characters. I wanted to help them all. This is one book that definitely has influenced my thinking about helping people who are in need of help.<br />Those in power are still doing the same things to hoard all the wealth.

B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I really wish I could say more about this one but that's all it was, just OK to me, I guess watching the other has soil me and I expected more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting! Would love different backgrounds and places!<br />Fun for all ages! The rewards need to be easier...or the unlocks easier.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Led Zeppelin's music speaks for itself - nuff said :')  Since I have to use 10 words to complete this review I guess I'll add, &#34;Great Album&#34;!  Lots of hits included on this disc.
B004NYQYNQ|4.0|Heard a coulple of her songs and enjoyed them.  Decided to download this album.  I listen out on radio for any new songs of hers.
B00846F1YW|4.0|If you like hidden objects game this one is for you. The challenges get trickier and trickier which makes it fun. The story line is exciting already and I'm not very far in the game but I know it's gonna be good. I look forward to finding out what's gonna happen next or what kind of challenges I may have. I don't really like how when you move around the screen on a Kindle I press down on the screen to move and every time I press it acts like I'm selecting an item which is wrong, too many of those and you get a penalty. It's habit to lift my finger for a second and look around so I always get penalties because when I move the screen again it gives an X. Don't let that discourage you though you get as many chances to pass the level as you want. So fun. I recommend it.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|what more can i say, johnny depp, emmanuelle seigner on the mystics trail in europe. plenty of mystery and intrigue.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I purchased two of these watches as gifts, one of them for myself. I've been obsessed with this watch since I saw it about a year ago. The colors, the aesthetics, the price, and something about solar power just interested me.<br /><br />Both watches arrived in nice quality boxes and both were working perfectly. The rotating bezels however were slightly different from one another in that one seemed to line up to the 12 mark a bit more accurately than the other. Overall, neither bezel on either watch is super accurate. Not a deal breaker at the price I paid though. Another thing, which I assumed all along, these watches are &#34;grey market&#34;. Considering the MSRP is roughly $400, this is a no-brainer. Anyway, the warranty card is not signed and stamped by the retailer which = &#34;grey market&#34;. Again, not a deal breaker given the price and because it's a Seiko, I really don't foresee anything happening to these watches. But buyer beware.<br /><br />So the watch itself is excellent. Beautiful fit and finish. The case size is perfect; not too small and not too large, and it has a nice presence. The face looks a tad cluttered but is easy to read. The date is a bit small and not something you can glance at quickly. Lume is excellent as well; nice and bright and lasts fairly long. I opted to rid the bracelet (the one and only thing I disliked about the watch) in favor of some NATO straps to compliment the blue accents on the watch. The bracelet can be easily removed with a paperclip inserted into the holes in the lugs. If you're wanting to do the same, you'll need a 20mm NATO strap. The locking crowns for the chronograph function were a nice touch as well. This watch looks similar to a high-end divers watch I own yet with a splash of color and comes in at a price where if I get some dings, etc., I won't mind at all.<br /><br />I really don't know what else to add. It does what it's supposed to, does it well and it looks great.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|Mothership!  One word says it all.  Back in my &#34;Hippy Days&#34;, Zepplin was a 'must have' CD.  My friends and I spent many hours listening to Zepplin.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|The game is pretty one-dimensional but sometimes that's what I want - just pass the time - no thinking involved.  However, this app comes with some pretty questionable ads.  I don't mind ads too much with most free apps I have used, but this app appears to think it's users like soft-porn, dating sites and very shady credit deals.. The ads became so offensive, I removed the app from my Kindle.
B002QY9RMA|4.0|Liked this particular song.  I didn't like all the songs on this particular album.  Just get song as I like it.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I can't find how to return and get my money back.  It won't even work on my Kindle Fire HD
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Awesome eclectic collection of music past and present all intertwined together nicely!<br />I recommend this soundtrack to everyone's ears !
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My husband and kids loved that I bought this collection for them.  It's a nice Blu-ray collection that we continue to enjoy.
B0062P3392|5.0|great cd  love it...fast shipping....amazingly good movie...every one of Jasons movies is better then the last one seen..I loved it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app so much!  I will spend hours playing this game because it is so much fun!  This is the most fun app ever!  Anyone will love it.
B002ZG97E2|4.0|Like this particular movie and wanted to add this one to my collection.  Movie was a good price to pay.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Just another Bond movie. Did not really hold my interest. Very much the old formula see it many times. The spectacular did not cover a very thin story. Could any survive one tenth of Bond's body experienced. Naw
B008I3R2VG|4.0|Love the killers and still like this album. I personally like the first half part better. But compare with their previous albums, its a bit weaker. Maybe it takes more time to find its beauty. :)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Stop what you are doing and read this book now.  Unless you are playing video games, then it can wait.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|Great movie....fast shipment...A+A+full of action almost every minute...I will buy all his movies.....the best i have seen in a lonf time
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I  love this book because it tells the story of a unperfect life!  This book is never ever not interesting.
B0030SCPZ2|5.0|If you play guitar or aspire to this is a must see. I loved the difference in styles of three generations of guitarists.
B000FC11A6|5.0|Every time I read a Stevenson book for the first time, I make mental plans to read it again. So rich, so funny.
1616550414|5.0|Great content for a Zelda fan, with detailed illustrations and revealing comments from the designers. Really happy with the purchase.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Loved both seasons, this one carried over well from the first. I had heard that there was a big difference between the two but I don't really see it. They blended well for me.<br /><br />The package is great, a nice box holding the fold-out with all the disks in it. Very sharp looking with the banners from the various houses on it. High quality product, worth getting the blu-ray over the DVD version for sure.<br /><br />-D
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great purchase! Really worth as a collectable. I saw it is a Sony Bravia 1080P and the pic is crystal clear.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was, meh, only okay.  I found it a bit confusing to follow.  While the author DID do a good job of keeping the reader guessing as to whether or not he really did kill his wife, I thought the ending was totally lame.
B001CO42MU|5.0|Quality of both sound and video were great on the blu-ray, it really brought out the quality of the movie.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This app intrigued me. I liked the overall appearence of the display. It's as technical as you want to make it. It tells you how much power is avaliable in the battery alomg with estimations about uses such as listening to music or watching videos. Overall It's a good app for me and I'd recommend it to a friend.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book pulls you in from the first chapter and never lets go. I loved the style in which it was written, bouncing around from the past to the future and intertwining multiple pieces of the story in ways you don't realize until the very end.<br />The story is narrated by Andy Barber, who's son, Jacob, has been indicted for murder. Andy is the assistant D.A. and was assigned to the case before evidence came to light that seemed to prove Jacob had committed the crime. Andy stays firm in his belief that his son could not have done it, but his wife (Laurie) has a harder time with this. The book takes you through the initial investigation, the accusation, the trial, and the aftermath.<br />I could not put this book down. While reading it, I always got the sense that a new revelation was right around the corner. There is a plot twist at the end that I personally did not see coming. I highly recommend this book to everyone, especially fans of suspense novels.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|There are a ton of sound options for this alarm program, most of which I'm sure people would never consider but it's fun to go through them and laugh at the possibility of waking up to some of the noises.  There are many good options as well, 5-stars.<br /><br />-D
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I did not realize that this game was on my device.  I have not played it or removed it.  I need to check it out.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was really really good!  Very well written, interesting insight into the foster parent/child relationship, and the flower stuff wasn't annoying or odd, it &#34;worked&#34; well in the book.  I could not put this book down, and want to read more from this author now.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I has an Otterbox previously but the rubber collected lint and well, it was kinda ugly. I wanted something that had more protection than some of the slimmest cases but still looked nice and didn't catch on stuff. This case is smooth like hard plastic but cushiony like rubber. It's fairly slim and I like how you can see the phone through it. All of the buttons/ports fit well. So far no problems at all.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|I downloaded this on a lark. When I was younger I was an avid star gazer. this app is just effective enough to bring back those days. It isn't difficult to use and it does offer satellite tracking as well. not bad for an occassional observer.
B0081336FO|5.0|I am a huge Sherlock Holmes fan and thought that the Mystery productions starring Jeremy Brent came the closest to glorifiying Arthur Conan Doyle's books, but Steven Moffat (Thank you for Dr. Who's revival!) and Mark Gatiss have ushered in genius to the telly!  Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson are perfect and the whole cast work together to create the estranged world of Holmes into a reality that exceeds fantasy. Andrew Scott as Jim Moriarty couldn't be better.  What a triumph.  Love it!!!
B005LAII8K|4.0|I think they have a very interesting story but didn't go nearly as deep into the potential as they could have.  Time travel movies have always interested me, and the concept of this one was a good base.  It was fun to watch but I have one big gripe that I couldn't help but knock it down a star for this review for:<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt's makeup was HORRID.  They tried to make him look like Bruce Willis (for obvious reasons) and instead made a freak out of him.  It was so bad from a couple angles that he didn't even look like a real person.  Let my mind do the work on believing he's a young Bruce Willis, I can do that all on my own.  Your terrible makeup with the screwed-up eyebrows and bone structure makeup almost ruined it for me.  Thank goodness through most of the movie they're not forcing that on you or my rating would have gone way down.<br /><br />-D
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoyed playing with others around the world.  Did not realize that if I didn't win enough games I would have to &#34;pay money&#34; to continue.  That is a bummer!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked this book. And I am wary of ANY book that is sad (this book is at times).  I was impressed with how spot on the author was in his writing from the perspective of a teenager, especially a teenager in love. Well done.  It got a little too poetic/deep for me at times, and I didn't quite buy the idea of them flying to the Netherlands (that part could've been better developed to be believable).  And I was confused by the second venn diagram.  Overall it was a good, fast read.
B00701L5XS|3.0|This App made my phone lock up quite a bit. As of the time of this review, I haven't used the app in a while. Hopefully at this point they have updated and fixed the issues.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The storyline, the clothes and the anticipation of what is upcoming makes for a great series drama. I will be buying season 4.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a very accurate testimony of all the elements involved in the hunt and killing of Bin Laden. It is amazing to learn how a soldier becomes a SEAL and ultimately a member of DEVGRU, and all the physical and mental preparation that takes to be the best soldiers in the world.<br /><br />Very interesting , as the truth behind the killing of Bin Laden has finally come up to light.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone interested in knowing about the fate of this infamous man, after years of the biggest manhunt in history.
0786948523|5.0|Not a cheaply made book at all. The pages are thick and glossy and the hard cover is solid. Descriptions are very clear, the format is on the money and easy to follow.<br /><br />-Starting at the very back there is a 2-page &#34;Monsters by Level&#34; section that is really handy for helping you to put leveled encounters together.<br />-Next there is a 4-page glossary section that (quoted): &#34;This section provides definitions and descriptions of monster characteristics that aren't spelled out in their stat blocks.&#34; There are thigns like Aberrant [Origin] and a description of what that means.<br />-Before that there are 4 pages of &#34;Racial Traits&#34; if you wanted to use them as player characters. Bugbears, Dopplegangers, Drow, Githyanki, etc. are all found here with their average height and weight, ability score bonuses, etc.<br /><br />Another really important thing about this book is that it lists tactics for most (if not all) monsters. I find this very handy.<br /><br />Highly recommended book, even if you have a DDI account it is handy to have around.<br /><br />-D
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hey this game is great with it's frequent updates to change locations always makes this game interesting. This is a great game.
B000EULJLU|3.0|It is another work of art by Tool. The CD arrived by estimated date. Packaging appears as new. My only complaint is skipping on 2 songs. Disc has small scratches in it. I have to try and get them fixed. Otherwise a perfect CD.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Could not put this book down once starting it.  It was riveting, and showed both the flaws and the heroism of the protagonist.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The season starts off slow but picks up significantly mid season and the cliffhanger ending is pretty awesome. Parallel dimensions can be ridiculous if not done right. Fringe excels at making pseudoscience and theoretical physics credible despite some of the far out unproven and seemingly impossible theories it depicts. Good solid sci fi.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hard to comprehend how the entire life of so many people were dedicated to the care of so few people and how insular that world is for the rich and poor alike when they are trapped in that world. Very hard to make a change when there is no middle class in that society. The plot is kind of plodding at times, but that goes along with the lifestyle of the time and place that this story tries to represent.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Once you &#34;got the hang of&#34; Dexter after the first season, this one grabs you by the scruff of your neck and makes you sit down and watch.  Dokes is easily one of my top 3 supporting characters in this entire series and he really shines in this season.  Michael C. Hall came into his own in this season and made the character his, I feel, and although they've tried changing up the formula a couple of times since then, this season (in my opinion) still holds fast as the season that set the bar for the rest.<br /><br />-D
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another amazing page turner by Nicholas Sparks. Be prepared to not want to put this book down. This would also make a great gift.
B007R41E8O|4.0|This is a good game overall.  The action moves a little bit slow.  Better story line than similar games.  Did have some save issues with game progress.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great read, but thought the character was a little unbelievable.  The ending was totally unpredictable and leaves you wanting more
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting game my daughter loves it n so do i...i recommend it...even though its fustrating when i can make jt far enlugh n the guy caughs me lol
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Purchased this watch for our son, who is a professional chef.  He has ruined several watches with designer labels costing up to twice the price of this Seiko.  They would last a month or two, and then be ruined.  However this serious diving watch has been worn almost every day since Dec 2010 working hard in a commercial kitchen, and has never had a problem.  Super reliable Seiko 7s36 automatic movement averages +1.5 min per month accuracy.  Will never need a battery, will run off the wrist about 36 hours from a full wind.  This is a big watch.  The bracelet is easy to adjust if you know what you are doing, but don't lose the tiny little collars that hold the pins in the links.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Plays well, very responsive touch which is important because you're sliding your finger around quickly to get better times.  Good game.<br /><br />-D
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This film pulls strongly on our emotions.<br />Denzel's ability to show what denial looks<br />like moved me tremendously. MAde me<br />vote fo rhim to win the Academy Award for<br />his mastery
B00993G41S|5.0|Great classic comedy, perhaps a cult classic. Great job from all actors. Kevin Kline shines in his malevolent role. Cleese shows his humor is much more dimensional then Monty Python. Great flick.
B000002LSV|5.0|I recently went to see ZZ Top at the Hard Rock Cafe in Hollywood, FL  What a show.  The original members of this 3-piece band still put on such a show.  Nothing has changed and you'd never believe that they are on the down side of their performing careers.  If you are going to own one album of their music, this is it.  All the classics that are their signatures plus a bunch that never made it strongly to radio play.  ZZ Top is my favorite road music to this day -- crank it up and put the pedal down.
B000ZM1MG4|4.0|I am very pleased with this dvd. Always loved it, can now add it to my collection of favorite ones.
1616550414|5.0|In depth information of the entire mythology revolving around Zelda. the Concept Art is also very good. all around I enjoyed it and im sure any fan of the series will find this really fulfilling.
B005LAII80|4.0|Thanks to reading a lot of reviews here and elsewhere I decided to pick this movie up.  It's not exactly what I expected, but pretty close.  Almost the entire movie takes place in a single building, but it's a HUGE futuristic community building that is on lock-down.  Lots of violence, some cheesy lines thrown in, but pretty good action and a couple twists that I didn't expect to see.  Worth a watch, in my opinion.<br /><br />-D
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Was surprised as to how easy it was to use on Kindle as so many other things aren't.  Not that I want the kindle fire for anything other than reading or perhaps listen to music.
B004OZZ624|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat pretty much the whole time.  I'm a big fan of Russel Crowe and he did not let me down.  I recommend this movie to everyone.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|However, we have been trying for months to be able to read and use whisper sync for our android phones.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Play it every day and twice when I'm on vacation. Love how it doesn't need wick. It is better than temple run.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Have been looking for Super Mario kindle games, but there's none. This is just like it,  addicting, can't get enough.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Got this as a gift for someone who watches the series yearly as a marathon event and she loved this DVD.  Very clear production, typical packaging.<br /><br />-D
B0086449YA|2.0|I expected something more from it. 2 CDs and nothing I have wanted to hear twice. It now sits in the rack. Maybe that's why they didn't release it in the US.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|first off i use this everyday for my youtube videos and it's great but....there are some issues. First would have to be the camera app malfunctioning when just idle, it will wig out and start turning the screen all around. Second would have to be  it not auto saving video takes, ive had times when it would record and it wouldnt save cuz it would wig out. Next would have to be the 1080p option it has, the moment you select it it locks you out and you have to reinstall the app. It has the option for 1080p but for some reason the kindle hd wont allow it on its camera....kind of a waste. But over all is a great app but would get a perfect five stars when they update this app to fix it all.
B001OI6YJI|4.0|Probably one of the more under rated sci-fi movies, this one has remained in my memory for years. Thank you Amazon for giving me the chance to see it again. Kirk is muscular,albeit aging. Farrah is gorgeous and Harvey is young. Kind of a simple plot, Harvey comes to the isolated space station where Kirk and Farrah have established a sort of Eden with their little dog. Harvey and the robot he's transporting there, arrive like the proverbial serpent altho with a lustful twist for the lovely Farrah. As can be imagined, things don't end well. While it's no Blade Runner, another movie that was initially panned,this movie deserves more attention than it received at it's debut.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a really good game. helps you understand how a real horse actually needs to be fared for and yeah its a good game
B007712XAU|5.0|What's not to love?  Got into the first season but haven't had to chance to watch season #2 yet.<br />Arrived just as promised.
0786955716|5.0|This is really a good set, the quality of the graphics are very good and it's very versatile for the 2 settings available. Generally one side has the outdoor city areas and the other side has underground sewer areas.<br /><br />Note that the front of the box shows roof tops, there are no tiles with the roofs on them, only the box they come in has that so don't expect any real use from those.  The value here is mostly with the street tiles, the sewer tiles and the added items like shop kiosks, carts, etc.  There are a few tiles that are limiting, like a cut out of indoor areas that only work well with each other and wouldn't really go with anything from the other sets.  Otherwise every tile will get use in my games.<br /><br />-D
0393338827|4.0|I like Michael Lewis’s style of writing. He knows the subject very well and is an experienced financial market expert. He is also a great story teller. You won’t feel bored reading his books. If it was not for his story telling skill many non-expert readers might find the arguments concerning the inner working of the financial markets boring. As the economists usually talk about the mechanics of the financial markets and the journalists about the on the ground facts as they unfold, this book adds a third dimension namely the human factor; greed, opportunism and sometimes absent of morality as contributing factors to the crash. It is an interesting book to read.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Oh how I miss him! His take on life - and death - was so  acute & perceptive. He was  courageous and steadfast to the last . Truly an inspirational book for those of us who look at things without guile.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Having read reviews of this movie I wasn't sure what to expect. I loved the original &#34;Alien&#34; but wasn't a fan of the sequels (this is Alien's prequel).This is one of the better sci-fi movies  (in my opinion of course). Some of the scenes are just breathtaking and the plot wasn't as murky as some reviewers complained. There is an intriguing concept behind it and for the action minded there are plenty of explosions and combat scenes. Plus the requisite repulsive sticky-slime alien life forms. Intense and never boring. Some reviewers complain that it leaves unanswered questions etc.,but the best movies, books et al usually do. There doesn't always have to be a happy or resolved ending, the right people don't always connect, the bad guy doesn't always get caught and so on. Just hope there's a sequel to this one!
B0096BIENY|5.0|If you like classical pop, this is the cd for you.  A wonderful collection of both classical and pop music....
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Wasn't sure I would enjoy this genre of film but I did.  Great story - it seemed like it was really happening in real time not 30 years ago!
B0050PYNOY|4.0|This movie has replay value and it was funner than I expected.  There are some hilarious scenes in it that keep my son and I talking about it now and then. Definitely glad I purchased this movie, was afraid it was going to be too stupid to want to watch again and I'm glad I was wrong about that.<br /><br />-D
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very cute  an easy way to show my godchild horses need work too.  Fun to play trainer and clean up also.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Sam Harris is a genius.  It is great to have a trained mind look at the topics that have been left up to superstition and guess-work philosophy.
B006AN78XS|4.0|I'm not always a fan about movies about time travel, it depends on the era and the circumstances of the characters. This is one of my favorites. The era we're taken back to is Paris cafe society in the 1920's. Scott and Zelda, Pablo and Papa Hemingway all make an appearance ....don't want to give the plot away. I'm a Woody Allen fan but would be the first to admit his movies can be hit or miss, this one is a hit, with romance, poignancy and humor.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|This was a great product I really enjoyed it. The price was affordable. Thank you very much. Will purchase again
B004HWT6DO|5.0|I thought this movie was great!  I'm sure it's not a 100% accurate depiction of the founders of Facebook, but it was entertaining and very well acted.  It's not an adventure movie, it's not a romance, it's just an interesting examination of a modern phenomenon.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Good storyline, but few surprises in the plot.  A good effort but I expected more based on the hype.  Disturbing stereotypes.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|A spell-binding adaptation of Jon Krakauer's book it nonrtheless left me with an empty feeling at the end. It is hard to feel sorry for McCandless. He hates his parents for no apparent reason other than they are sucessful, goes off on a hair brained adventure lacking even the barest essentials needed for survival and makes two fatal mistakes that end uo costing him his life. Well acted and the scenery is breath taking. I was riveted to my seat during the entire film. Not one part of this film is unnecessary. At times I felt myself wanting to reach throught the screen, grab McCandless bu the neck and shake some sense into him. It's bad enough to live in a society where life is taken by reasons beyond our control so it makes me angry when a promising life is snuffed out that couold have been avoided with a small modicum of planning. I feel very bad for the family of Chris McCandless. He seemed to have no regard whatsoever for their pain and suffering. He may as well have commited suicide.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The series starts out well and has a lot of hooks that will need addressed in season 2.  There are some situations that are hard to believe but it is a TV series.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I rented this movie to watch with a group of like 30 friends. It's such a fun and cute movie, but I had a few issues with the viewing quality that were slightly disruptive. Other than that, it was great!
1594203334|5.0|If only everyone read this, book there would be a lot fewer annoying kids running around the US. Excellent advice for parents!.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a great read all around!  This book was not at all what I expected.  It was a very good surprise - I would definitely recommend this book.
B007REV4T8|4.0|The welcome upside to this movie is Dench is finally out of the way.  Few agree with me but I enjoyed the first two much more.  The villian with his computers on the island was too cartoonish.  Not a thoughtful plot at all.  It gets 4 starts for the action and special effects.  The acting was only fair with a weak plot.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Cant read this quick enough as i just want to find out what happens. Fantastic imagination, great variety of characters. i love the way he gives each of his main characters a chapter - keeps you hanging out for what happens to the next. Descriptive language enables you to imagine what these places and cultures are like. Love the whole idea f the wall and the people who live beyond it.<br />Not much i don&#34;t like about this series however you do have to enjoy sequels as it's a lot of reading but well with the time.<br /><br />Anyone who likes Lord of the Rings, The Athur legends etc.. should enjoy these books.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|The whole family loved and we've watched it several times.  A little inappropriate for the younger ones but we're hoping it went over her head.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|I hats because it kills people and what of some body started it in the Usa that means you would die in the game so this game is crap so make it free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game in the world but unfortunatly it sucked. terrabley fun dumb game. I hate this game because its the best game in the world.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|i totally enjoyed the movie..i do enjoy most of alfred hitchcock movie.  this one was reasonably good.  it shows what went on while making of the movie Psycho.  found it movie entertaining as well as informative.  even though some of it was fictional of course.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Great, show great cast, great music! Wish it had a few more of the big hit songs off the show, but I can always purchase those separately. Definitely worth the small amount of money I paid.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|i can always find time to get a workout in. i use this apps 5 days a week. i just love it.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|What a wonderfully charming movie. Quirky and understated, yet very heartwarming. Certain well worth seeing by anyone and everyone.<br /><br />If the best you can do is generic Hollywood blockbusters, fine, more power to you, but if you don't check out wonderful independent films like this you are losing out on some great cinema.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|This is a pretty nice game.  It did take some getting used to tilting the phone to make the fish go where I wanted.  Nice way to spend a few minutes out of your day
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|good design..haven't used it that much.. but so far i like it...will give update in few weeks, when i've it long enough to review.

B005LAIIPS|2.0|my dad was bored I was bored my mom was bored my brother was bored. it is not the same without Matt Damon, I actually sold this movie right after I watched it, terrible and worthless.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Guy from Idol, again proves you don't have to win ( Adam Lambert as an another sample ) Great CD.
B007LE2VDM|4.0|This disk runs a bit more &#34;folksy&#34; than I would typically gravitate toward, but a few key elements really make this a stand out for me:<br /><br />Lyrics - Generally intelligent and strong, a bit pessamistic for my personality, but coherent communication that i am excited to watch as her life experience unfolds<br /><br />Voice - I appreciate Christina's clear tone, that she uses embellishments (such as runs) tastefully and that she is not afraid to hold a strong dissonant note when the occasion calls for it.<br /><br />Enunciation - This is HUGE to me!  I can understand every word without having to read liner notes, her sentences make sense, and I feel like I can either be having a conversation with her, or using her words to express my own thoughts.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|A well written and fun show to watch.  I love the chemistry between all the main characters.  Can't wait to see more.
B0063IH60K|4.0|really a great game!! always count on it for long trips an just to pass time!!!! just needs more table and deck choices.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Ok, so I am not big on Aliens or Nuns but this show is the greatest.  From the crazed patients to the even more crazed staff, the story line is weird but keeps you hooked.  Better then Season 1.  Can't wait for Season 3.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|planet earth is nice, this set is wonderful, I enjoyed watching all 6 discs. I loved how it came with a nice cover
0793542049|5.0|Ed does a great job laying out the concept behind developing a strong walking line.  I know some theory, so that helps, but the book lays out the info in such a way that you don't need to know anything about theory.  Good book
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|movie was fine. pixar rendered it well. characters were very flat and predictable. movie was very dense with lots of things happening in every seen, cameras never stopped moving. up and wreck it ralph were much better
B009GEFXLC|5.0|A well written and fun show to watch.  I love the chemistry between all the main characters.  Can't wait to see more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wonderful multi-level story. Always love when he ties in past stories and characters with his current project. He is a perfectly balanced writer, provides enough discription to get your imagination going but doesn't slow the story down with it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|We got this bag to hold our new digital camera. I was amazed at the quality and versatility of the bag. It has a very handy compartment to store the camera with a large lens, plenty of reconfigurable compartments for extra lenses and accessories, and is will padded to protect the gear inside.
B005LAII1C|3.0|I was excited to see this, but the jokes were not very funny. I like the opening part, but the story was just silly and repetitive.
B00BESCJII|4.0|Provided insight to feelings that everyone feels at some time in their life. Great family movie. Should be watched together.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This app is very buggy, keeps crashing and won't reload.  When it does work, it's a nice app to have.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Yeah, it can get radio stations in.  Not very many of them however.  Thankfully it was free.  It was uninstalled a few days later.
0070511136|4.0|This book introduces the reader to the main differences between managing small spot sales and large and complex ones, which require much more strategy. The conclusions, based on hundreds of hours going on sales calls, give hints on how to shorten the sales-cycle an assure more closings.
1936594234|5.0|For over a decade, this book has been my &#34;Bible&#34;. While scripture is sprinkled lightly throughout, The Power of Your Subconcious Mind is an easy read that delves into the practical realm of living life to the fullest by positive thinking and right action. The experiences of many sages, historic figures, and average people are examined with a focus on bringing more health, wealth, happiness and wisdom into your life in every decision you make. The book emphasises visualizing right choices to produce outcomes that are aligned with the plans of the 'Divine Intelligence' that guides us all in answering the eternal question: &#34;Why am I here?&#34; I give copies of The Power of Your Subconcious Mind as gifts for life's milestones (graduation, loss, birth). While some readers might find the examples outdated (written in the 1940-60s) the book carries inspiration on every page that I can refer to when my thinking needs a 'tune-up'.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a good ending. A little drawn out but good.<br />Not surprised by the surprise though very much satisfied.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS WELL WRITTEN AND KEPT MY ATTENTION THROUGH OUT.. I KNOW THAT I WILL REREAD IT MANY TIMES
0060245867|5.0|I remember reading this book as a child and I found the story to be fun and educating. As an adult, I find my self using the title line in several aspects of my own life. It's even quoted in one of my favorite movies of the 90's Air Force One!!! It's message is straight forward and powerful.

B004GUSG4M|2.0|I honestly don't know why I didn't like it.  Maybe it was to wordy, or not enough action for me.  It bored me.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I have been gaming with this mouse for about a month now and really like it a lot.  The changing color icon is a bit useless but at least you can do it.  So far so good.  I would recommend this product.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I chose this rating because This is my favorite game but I am having trouble getting my updates<br />I LOVE THIS GAME BUT HELP ON UPGRADES WOULD BE GREAT

B0086700CM|5.0|My sister and I love this game and may even have an addiction. I really recommend this game for someone who doesn't have anything to do all day. If that is even possible.<br />:-D
B005B19UPE|5.0|Sarah's Key is an oustanding novel by Tatiana De Rosnay. Once you start reading it, you will not want to put it down. Sarah is a young Jewish girl living in France during July 1942. Her family has been froced to leave their home by the French Police. When Sarah realizes what is happening, she locks her little brother in their secret hiding place and says she will return for him. The book goes through Sarah's journey of being placed in camps and getting separated from her parents. While all of this is happening, the book switches back and forth between Sarah's life back then and a journalist, Julia, in the present day who is trying to fit all the pieces of Sarah's past together. Julia learns of her ties to Sarah's story and does everything she can to find out what happened to Sarah and her younger brother she left behind. Although it is not a non-fiction novel, Sarah's Key brings up a lot of thoughts as to what really happend in France during this time period and what people actually know about it today. You will not be disappointed if you choose to read this book.
B003ZSI7R2|4.0|I saw them on Letterman and I was blown away.  The rest of the album is not quite as exciting as &#34;Blues Hand Me Down&#34;, but it's very good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun and interesting.  Some of the instructions are confusing, but it a great way to past the time.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|This is a wonderful tool for my Bible Study. My only complaint is the small print. I know many others who use this Bible as well.
B0092MKFIY|1.0|I hate that I can't download this album to my ITUNES, but can only listen to it on the website.  I could have done that on youtube.  lame.  I'm sure it's a great album, but I should not have bought music through amazon.  I learned my lesson I guess.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I've watched all six seasons and will watch if add long as it runs!  All of the characters are hilarious!
B002KRFND0|5.0|I'm really excited to read this book, i've always wanted to read it! I recommend it to mystery fans like myself!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|From the beginning of the movie all the way to the end this movie had you at the edge of your seat.  Very well written and produced.  The actors and actresses were awesome.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the old version; I updated the weather channel app on my phone when the update came out without reading the reviews.  The new update sucks.  It is a huge ad for Toyota, nothing is user friendly, and it looks like a child designed it.  The only reason I downloaded it from Amazon is that they still had the old version.  I will not update it. The older version is wonderful I have been using it for years as I ride a motorcycle during the summer here in Michigan.  The weather is always right and I love the hour by hour forecast. I am getting a new phone in a few weeks and hope to be able to still get the older version. If not, I will be switching to Weather Bug.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|EXCELLENT effort, perfectly done, arguably the best CD of the year(2012)of it's genre! Black Radio is what's up!<br /><br /> *The Remix CD known as Black Radio Recovered: The Remix EP is outstanding also.
0525457585|4.0|*** Spoilers Ahead ***<br /><br />For fans of the 1984 Wolfgang Peterson film that haven't read The Neverending Story by Michael Ende, the imaginative work the film is based on, learning the movie only accounts for the first half of the book can be a startling realization. For me, it was like discovering an authentic, not-quite-a-sequel continuation to one of my favorite childhood stories--sort of like unearthing a buried treasure you didn't know was hidden.<br /><br />Unfortunately the second half is not nearly as good as the first, and other reviewers have said as much. Perhaps I'm biased since I was awed by the movie at such a young age, but I feel the producers were right to focus solely on the first part and end the movie just as Bastian enters Fantasia (or Fantastica, as it's named in the novel).<br /><br />Thankfully, the book's conclusion redeems where the story lags. I recommend this one for fans of fantasy and YA novels.
0345525558|5.0|Beautiful written, still in need to read more. Recommended<br />to bookclubs for a good reading!The words and story are<br />amazing. Big eye opener about foster parenting.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is one of my fav shows it's just too bad it was cancelled before it's time. The characters are well developed and well written story lines.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck at his best!<br /><br />A movie you wold not miss.  I watched it twice and will probably watch one more time.
0792163710|5.0|This Western has so many firsts: 1st bad guy dressed Black; 1st bar fight; 1st fight under horses, and the list goes on. Alan Ladd spent many hours learning the fast draw. Shane is the fastest gun alive but winds up protecting a family from land grabbers. The gunfight between Jack Palance's character and Shane is one for the ages.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I would give it a full 5 stars if there were just a few more options available to customize the view for reading.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|The karate kid, this movie is a classic and the story all begin's with a boy, namely daniel larusso who lived in new jersey, rasita with his mom lucille larusso. When her husband died of unknown causes her and son move to Los angeles, where daniel starts to encounter problems fitting into school and dealing with a group of bullies who go by the names of tommy, jimmy, bobby, dutch and johnny who formed together go by the name of the cobra kai's, who are all best friend's and do karate together at the cobra kai dojo taught by the legendary sensai john kreese and take a disliking to daniel and from there bully him on a daily basis until one night an old man &#34;mr. miyagi&#34; who happens to be the apartment maintenance man saves daniel from a brutal confrontation. After saving daniel, mr. miyagi then teaches daniel the fundamentals of karate and that pretty much sets the tone for the first movie.<br />Karate kid part 2, practically picks of immediately where the original left off and starts of after the tournament, as the story progress mr. miyagi receives sad news of his father's death and leaves america to okinawa, japan where daniel learns the history of karate where unfortunately both daniel and miyagi encounter new rivals.<br />Karate kid part 3, well it kinda goes back to the original formula where daniel is still the all valley champion and has captured the eyes of an business man terry silver who seeks to get revenge on both daniel and mr. miyagi for what he believes have become the ruin of sensai john kreese's life and enlists the help of a new karate contender mike barnes.<br />Karate Kid part 4 - next karate kid, sees the departure of daniel larusso and a new story emerge as a new girl julie pierce who goes to a new school and encounters many problems with the outside world all around her as well as being anti social. Julie pierce soon starts attracting the attention of 2 boys, one of which is nice who want's to get know her and the other who acts like anass and shows nothing but brawn to get her attention which later becomes lethal.<br />Overall review, the karate kid movies from part 1-2 are quite solid and sets the tone for the whole karate kid saga with daniel learning the basics and then in the sequel learn it's history which was great but sadly seemed to have drop the ball by the 3rd movie but still however gives an important lesson which was to keep a cool head under pressure and learn to pick your battles however by the time of the 4th movie my estimates was that the karate kid hype was already over. The karate kid part 4 was pretty much more or less a stand alone movie even though it had mr. miyagi in it didn't coarse in terms of the story line and pretty much was unbelievable at times like julie having a fight with man practically stronger than her in the final scene.<br />The karate kid box set would be an excellent product to own for yourself or the family it's good for people of all ages and is definitely a timeless classic that will never get out of style
B00A18KCSQ|5.0|I listened to this album before I bought it, had good expectations based on their previous albums, but it blew me away. I bought it because this is exactly the kind of hard work and talent you have to support. It's soothing and powerful, creating a wave-like motion of feelings and sounds that leave you feeling energized yet peaceful by the end. It has definitely become one of my favorite albums.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I just bought this 3 weeks ago and now it won't work: ( its myfavorite game I'm very very sad:(
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|This is war propaganda and exaggerated lies sold by Washinton through Hollywood. All freedom lovers need to boycott this disgusting propaganda film.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Missed this group at SXSW, but I will be certain that I don't the next time!  I can't think of anything to say, except carthartic, lights my soul up, ignites my passions.  Love, love, love.  Your bones.  Beneath My Bed.  I dream to this music and have been way before I ever heard them.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|(Blu-Ray Version)<br /><br />I had never heard of this movie until I was randomly looking up under rated Sci-Fi films and this one popped up.  Great premise to the movie (not over the top), good acting over all, and fairly intense.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|aH....
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I heard this was the dvd to get for 3d. It has not let me down this is awesome 3d quality.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nice to play. I like how the coins drop and how you can increase your rewards as you work through the levels.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I started this series because both my older children read it and really enjoyed it. It was a great book! I could hardly put it down and can't wait to read the next book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Always enjoy John Grisham.  This is one was especially good.  It kept me guessing and trying to figure out where he was going with it.  It was a quick read mostly because I did not want to put it down.
B001CTDH76|5.0|This is an awesome show. I bought the DVD set so there will be no more nights with nothing to watch on TV.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It's a children's book, bear that in mind when you read it.  A delightful little story to pass the time.
B002GOAH1A|5.0|I received the movie in good time and in great shape. I was very pleased with my purchase & would buy again. Thank you, KS
B005OCHOZS|4.0|This book tells in micro detail how Scott pushed his body and mind farther than anyone else before. It is real, not a self-help book. It has motivated me to push a little harder in everything i do.<br />Gave it four starts becasue the recipes interrupted the narration. And the Dusty and wife issues was too much honesty for me. Love Dusty.<br /><br />This book is for anyone that wants to achieve something in life, not just winning a race.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Elegantly conceived, gripping, well-paced, beautifully depicted drama with intriguing characters.  Conveys a rich sense of the period--not just the events but also the values and culture.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Once I saw this movie on TV I had to have my own copy and so my sister thought I deserved one. I curled up on the sofa, with my tea and watched this amazing love story.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|This is an awesome show. I bought the DVD set so there will be no more nights with nothing to watch on TV.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Creators did a great job. Just a fun challenging game with a good story.  I hope to play more by this maker.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Each year gets better and better. My wife and I were given season 1 last year year and just started watching it in Jan this year. We liked it so much we purchased season 2,3 and 4 all from Amazon. They get 5 stars!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Eggcellent!!  This movie to me was just what I had eggcpected!  Very good, I see what the Oscar buzz was about, well directed.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|State sponsored hacking is with us now and this bood shows how subtle it can be.  It's the new way of spying and will be for a long time.
B0086700CM|4.0|Enjoy the game, and my son loves to play it.  My husband prefers this one to the new version, though I enjoy the new one.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I have to say that I was curious about these books. I didn't read any reviews but I knew a lot of women who had read all three and they seemed to have enjoyed them. I finally got around to checking them out and I really don't see what all the hype was about. In my opinion all three books are definitely not very well written. The thing I found to be the most irritating is how she throws in a bunch of big words but then uses the adjective \\"delicious\\" over and over again! I couldn't help wanting to rip my hair out every time I would see it! Did she not realize how many times she had already used that damn word?? So annoying.<br /><br />It was a very unbelievable scenario to begin with. I know that they are fictional pieces, but I would categorize them as fantasy novels...with a whole lot of repetition!
B001FB0WBK|5.0|This is well recorded and will make even the best guitarists want to hang it up. He must be from another planet!
B004XQYBA2|3.0|Thought this game would be fun and easy, but it is not. Love playing it, but, it is hard to win a game
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I have been listening to this music while I study. The quality of the tracks is amazing. My favorite tracks are A Place in Heaven, Immortal, and Sonera; but there are too many to count. Each track flows well from the next one.<br /><br />Also, take note and compare the length of these tracks to those of competitors in the epic music genre. The problem with epic music CD's is that, being music primarily from trailers, all the tracks are like 1-2 minutes long. This one has many more long tracks, and they aren't just long to be long (cough cough Hans Zimmerman in Batman), each one has a unique flavor, a subtle development, and in many cases sweet vocals.<br /><br />If I heard this music in Cirque du Soleil I would probably freak out! :)<br /><br />For $8.99 this is the steal of the year in terms of quality music.<br /><br />Daniel
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This is a great app. I have chronic insomnia and require very particular conditions to sleep. This offers a great selection of sounds to choose some to create the perfect background noise. I only took the star off because WOW it kills my Fire battery. I have played audiobooks and MP3s all night without this kind of drain.
0803731094|5.0|My grandson watches the video of this book all the time, so he was so excited to get the book for Christmas.  Great book, very cute story!!
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I heard this over the PA system at Barnes and Noble..i had no idea who was singing. I ask and now i not only know who Emmy Rossum is...I love her and her majestic voice! I am thoroughly obsessed with the entire CD!!
B002PLALCO|5.0|Great show! Well recorded. I especially liked the tributes to Led Zeppelin and Queen. The aerialstuff is amazing. This girl is fearless.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|This game is a fairly nice helicopter piloting game, but it is very difficult to control on a fast tablet.<br /><br />Even without that problem, the levels seemed very sensitive, the helicopter is not able to rotate about it's center, but instead seems to rotate around the camera location when turning making it very hard to maneuver.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This is an interesting film. Tommy Lee does a great job. If you are a Tommy Lee fan you should def check it out otherwise its a skip.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I purchased this for my husband, he loves it. I have one for myself which I use daily, he true  three different ones and likes this o e the best.
B00746O3X8|4.0|For this price you get a good product: comfortable, safe for your cameras and easy to use. Besides, you can remove the second cam carrier.<br />Very solid!!!
B0085157B8|2.0|and away from this movie. Unless you like terrible horror movies. I knew what I was getting into with movie but still had to give it a chance. the first film was also ridiculous but was fun and had some decent moments. This was nothing more then beautiful very well endowed women bouncing around, If you were to combine any after midnight cinemax movie with a syfy channel original you have piranha 3dd . There were not even that many scenes with the piranhas.<br /><br />I am giving this 2 stars only because of the very fun/funny performance of Mr David Hasselhoff, if the hoff ever made a movie with Bruce Cambell I would be the first to watch.<br /><br />overall a subpar B movie that tries to get by on T&A and ultimately comes up short
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love history - this is history come to life. I was very interested in the clothing and customs of the times.
B004Y042N8|5.0|This is a fun and easy game.<br />Each level has an array of dots with lines connecting in various configurations.  Your job is to light up every edge by moving from dot to dot.  If you get every edge lit, you win the level, and if you get stuck on a dot with no unlit lines leading away from it, you lose.<br /><br />The secret is that each level has either zero &#34;odd&#34; dots or two &#34;odd&#34; dots. An odd dot has an odd number of edges leading away from it. Always start on one odd dot and end on the other odd dot and it will be very easy to win.
B005WQ4RP6|3.0|This is a classic flick. One you almost have to see just because. However I dont find that it holds up to the test of 20+ years.

B009EEPPQ2|4.0|This is an awesome movie for Bruce Willis action junkies. This is definitely one of the best of the Die Hards.

1781161097|5.0|Great value for its price and if you loved the movie, there is no better purchase.<br />Totally recommended for sci fi fans.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Good creepy flick. Kinda twisted but it's a horror movie called sinister sooo...unexplained murders, possessed kids, ancient demons. Ya know, all the usual warm and fuzzy things
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Brings history to life.<br /><br />The characters are  believable and interesting to read about.<br /><br />I've read &#34;Fall of the Giants&#34; and am looking forward forward to the third book.<br /><br />I am recommending the trilogy to my friends.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Never thought I'd ever watch a zombie movie again. I'm 73 yrs. old and never cared for the genre. My offspring told me to try it out. really like it!
B00008S7KC|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it!  The Director's Cut is what she asked for and she's glad she did, she said it has great footage of Pink Floyd.
B008476HBM|4.0|a superb photograph of the way we were and of all the misery we are able to inflict and self-inflict. Are we all that different now?<br />Probably not, we only use a simpler lingo.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This was already on my Kindle when I purchased it.<br />So I very much appreciate it. Solitaire helps with hand-eye coordination and being able to find solutions faster.
B00870Z9HY|5.0|The music is amazing.  Truly an enjoyable experience. Closure for Christine and Phantom.  Actual taping of the play in London.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Since I bought the kindle version it's kind of hard to mess up.  Love the series on t.v. and in the books.

B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app! it saves you a lot!! especially you can download the videos you want onto your kindle so when you take it to somewhere that doesn't have any wifi you can just go to your gallary and play the videos you downloaded from this app. it helps me a lot because I'm a dancer and I can just click on the videos I downloaded and not have the hassle to go back and forth to find the same video on youtube... get this app its awesome!!!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Same thing as the more expensive covers. Definitely more affordable than the ones at Best Buy.<br />I know because I use to work there. Good job.
0761169253|3.0|To me, this is more of a fun table top book, nothing that I would take too seriously.  A read and give away to someone else book, nothing to keep on the shelf.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I am not a hardcore Trekker. Although I went to a few Star Trek conventions when I was in college, I have never participated in the nerdy slap fights about whether Ensign Tomlin was right-handed or left-handed in episode 12. (Totally making that name up, kids, so don't go looking.) I might have read one of the paperback novels based on the original series, but that's a big if. Thus, my review of Star Trek comes from a moderate, but not total, familiarity with the subject matter.<br /><br />The movie was solid. There, I said it.<br /><br />I thought the actors did a commendable job, keeping some of the core aspects of the characters from the TV show, but imbuing them with some logical updates. The pacing lags a little in the middle, but that happens in a lot of Act IIs in standard three-part dramas. And yes, there is an abundance/abuse of lens flare, courtesy of JJ Abrams. But, the overall sum of the parts is more than the individual pieces and the end result is an entertaining movie, as long as you go into it without the expectation that you're going to see the original series verbatim.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Very happy with this game.  It is easier than spider solitaire on the computer.  Like the way the moves are made.  Highly recommend.
B005VR91UW|5.0|He loved this - took him right back to when his father (classic music listener) stormed out of the house when he put lil Richard on as a teenager
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A very interesting story, well worth the read.  He finally did venture forth, and the reaction of those he met along the way surprised him.
B005HEPN06|5.0|This is the best of the best in Star Trek. I love Patrick Stewart, but the rest of the cast is good too!!  We need more TV offerings like this!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like the graphics and layout. It also seems accurate for my region, N.W.Indiana.I also like having access to maps ,&amp; five day forecasts.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever seen. It is almost impossible to stop watching it. We end up watching two to the a night.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Not sure I like this.  Doesn't seem to take a good picture, however, that said, I haven't fooled with it much.  Might just be me.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love how it's for all ages.and all of the things they added. It's so fun I would definitely recamend this app.
