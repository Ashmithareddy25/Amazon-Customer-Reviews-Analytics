1423113497|5.0|I saw the movie first; then (and there) I decided I wanted to read the book 'cause I felt something was missing and the potential of such a story was much greater than what the movie shown. I wasn't disappointed. The first book is just great! I hope my sons will enjoy it when they will improve their English (we're Italians) enough to be able to read it. I can reccomend it also to \\"grown-up kids\\" like myself!
0749953357|4.0|As I typically do, I acquired both the hard copy book and the audio version since he reads it himself. I have enjoyed Seth's books for more than a decade and am a raving fan (some say groupie others say stalker!). Seth has an uncanny knack of envisioning a future trend and releasing a book at a relevant moment in history. The subtitle of the book poses an important question in today's job economy: \\"Are You Indispensable?\\"     Linchpin reminded me a little of \\"[[ASIN:0743221230 Survival is Not Enough: Shift Happens]]\\", another longer and deeper read of his. Whether self-employed, under-employed or even unemployed, this book has lessons to learn. As a former entrepreneur and current marketing professional in a non-profit organization, I applied the lessons I learned immediately. During our Haiti humanitarian response, I thought of the derivative phrase \\"Linchpin Leadership\\" and tried to apply it to leading our Internet communications and marketing team. I also observed two of my colleagues demonstrating such linchpin leadership in leading their communications and fundraising teams.    Seth's books over time have grown in reach and appeal from niche marketing and business, to broader social networking and \\"social networthing\\". On a personal note, his book \\"[[ASIN:1591841666 The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)]]\\" helped to inspire me to break a [[ASIN:1904994504 Guinness World Records 2010]] for the longest tennis rally with my twin brother.    I love the subtle details of the book from the jacket design, which on its interior features a mosaic of profile pics of members of his tribe as he did with [[ASIN:1591842336 Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us]] (I admit, I looked at the inside of the jacket for my pic before reading the book). A new addition is the word cloud in front and back inside pages. Linchpin is bigger than his recent works in length and in size. It contains 244 pages including a bibliography if you are so inspired to readrelated texts. This book makes a great gift whether you buy it for yourself or give it as a gift because it truly is one. Thanks Seth.

B0038QMREA|5.0|Over the past two years I don't think I've listened to any artist more than Kristian Matsson (The Tallest Man on Earth) and his first album. His music is universally appealing.    The lyrics on The Wild Hunt are stronger on paper than those on the first album. His voice that I thought was perfect the first time around also manages to sound better. He does a great job at making the lyrics fit with the music rather than being the focus of it.    The single King of Spain is the PERFECT response to all the people wasting their time comparing him to Bob Dylan, etc. In it, he refers to Bob Dylan as both the King of Spain and an eagle (symbolic of freedom). Kristian says throughout the song that he is neither Dylan nor trying to be him.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|Season 4 of Supernatural is definitely the best thus far.   I have loved the show from the pilot but is seams that Supernatural is like a good bottle of wine, it gets better with age. This season has everything we have come to expect from the show incl. action, suspense, drama, romance and comedy plus of course a cliff hanger finale.   This is must have for any SN fan.
B000000H57|5.0|A true legend is no more. Reading on all the metal websites and other musicians writing what Peter meant to them, makes me emotional. Every one said what a great guy he was, and that speaks volumes. Very few people can have everyone they knew say such positive things about them. I can't imagine knowing someone for 37 yrs and then suddenly lose them (Josh Silver in his statement on their site). Reading Sal Abruscato's statement, the tears just flowed. Honestly, their all I can listen to and hearing them just makes me emotional. I'm glad I got to see them in concert 2xs. Excellent concerts in 2007 & 2008. Went to the Jagermeister tour just to see them for 30 minutes. Worth every penny. Undeniably underrated. I am saddened to the core.<br /><br />RIP Peter Steele 1962-2010
B001OQCV2O|1.0|Having very little to do with the Mayan calendar and its supposed threat of global doom in 2012 and more interested in being a CGI spectacle, this movie will most likely desensitize you to any impending crisis and make you wonder why you bothered watching it. Oh look, a CGI disaster. And another. And another. And ...oh look!...it's another one!<br /><br />Going to see a Roland Emmerich (director) film can be dicey at the best of times, and downright ugly if you're unfortunate. Arguably his greatest film was [[ASIN:B002KPINY8 Stargate]] which was spun off into a highly successful TV series on the SciFi Channel. But some fans are divided on others such as [[ASIN:B000WQWPKA Independence Day]], [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]] and [[ASIN:B000PAAJVA The Patriot]]. Then we get into the \\"bad\\" category with Moon 44, The Day After Tomorrow, and 10,000 B.C. (I think a little vomit came up the back of my throat for that last one).<br /><br />If you've seen any world doom films in the past 15 years, you'll not see anything that'll surprise you here. Things like DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON are pretty much a dime a dozen nowadays. And so goes 2012 ...but with a really poor script and some serious miscasting.<br /><br />Although John Cusack was an early childhood favorite of mine, starring in such low-brow comedies as BETTER OFF DEAD and ONE CRAZY SUMMER, he's grown into much more substantial roles in subsequent years, shining in HIGH FIDELITY, WAR, INC., and the astounding [[ASIN:B000MNOX7Q Identity]]. But here John appears to have gone after the money. Reading the script, one can't help but wonder why anyone would choose to be in it. It really has no viable characters and relies solely on its massive special effects budget. But the actors did come. And not just Mr. Cusack.<br /><br />Chiwetel Ejiofor (can anyone pronounce his name?) tries to give some additional star power but can't grab any traction, either. Too bad. He's become quite a versatile actor, going from the feminine [[ASIN:B000GFLE1S Kinky Boots]] to the rugged [[ASIN:B001KOFH2G Serenity]].<br /><br />Thandie Newton ([[ASIN:B000EWBKLW Crash]]) gives the film even more eye-candy as the attractive daughter to the President. But here she is more caricature than character, giving some of the worst lines in the entire film.<br /><br />Oliver Platt ([[ASIN:B001TH93GU Frost/Nixon]]) tries to play \\"the bad politician\\" and his lines, like Thandie Newton's, are so ridiculously contrived as to be laughable.<br /><br />The only saving grace - acting-wise -  was the role of Charlie Frost, a conspiracy theorist, played by Woody Harrelson ([[ASIN:B002WY65W4 Zombieland]]). He so over-played the character that it made him fun to watch and not a chore.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a good disaster movie, this ain't it. It has nothing for you to grab onto, except maybe pieces of the planet's crust ...and we see that more often than the actors themselves.the rugged [[ASIN:B001KOFH2G Serenity]].

B002VECMAO|1.0|My title says it all.  I just can't believe that George Clooney would be associated with this.  It was terribly not funny!
0307271862|2.0|Did you ever go to a horror movie and silently tell the heroine \\"don't go in the basement!  don't go in the basement!\\" and of course, she does???  Well, why would the protaganist (an experienced judge involved in many criminal cases), put herself in so much danger in a foreign country.  This, and so many other inconsistencies, (and so many red herrings) made The Man from Beijing a frustrating read.  My advice is to tie this book up in that red ribbon and send it to someone who isn't too concerned with logic.
B002ZG983M|5.0|The film is based on a comic book by the same name. The rights to the story were sold before the book was even published (it debuted only eight weeks before the film):<br /><br />A teenage boy decides to take a stand for justice. He dons a green scuba costume and names himself Kick-Ass. However, not having any actual superpowers, this hero's good intentions quickly land him in an ICU. Eventually though, Kick-Ass crosses paths with a couple of far more effective (a.k.a. deadly) heroes: Big Daddy, a former cop falsely convicted of drug trafficking, and Hit-Girl, his eleven year old daughter. Big Daddy has spent the past six years training his little girl in all forms of mortal combat, hoping she would help him revenge her mother's death and her father's fall from grace, orchestrated by a local Mafia Boss.  Enter blood, gore, and plenty of belly laughs...<br /><br />Let me get straight to the point: yes, the film was funny and highly entertaining. However, initially I felt uneasy laughing at an eleven year old girl determinedly slaughtering a roomful of men, even if they were rotten to the core and disserving of every bullet and of every knife wound. But then, I remembered what I was like at that age: it was the early 80's. My favourite toys were a silver colt revolver and a sword. Depending on my mood, I would pretend to be a cowboy taking on a bunch of wild Indians, or a Jedi disarming (literally) Darth Vader and his evil cohorts. So, if any of you want to believe that little girls' minds are all about sugar and spice, well... good luck with that (by the way, I managed to grow into adulthood WITHOUT slipping into drugs and/or alcohol, and no, I was not a teenage mother). And so, that quick recollection gave me the permission to look at the film as an absurd exercise in fantasy and allowed me to enjoy every minute of it. Yes, the film was well written, directed and edited, but the special mention must go to the actress who portrayed Hit-Girl. Chloe Moretz was indeed eleven at the time of filming, but had the presence of a seasoned performer. I am looking forward to watching her future projects.  There is already talk of a sequel. I'd pay to see it!<br /><br />Laugh and enjoy!e of filming, but had the presence of a seasoned performer. I am looking forward to watching her future projects.  There is already talk of a sequel.

B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Even as an adult male I enjoyed seeing this movie with my preschool daughter at the theater, my daughter could not take her eyes off the screen with her short attention span.  As my wife braided our daughters (preschooler and toddler) hair even she enjoyed the dvd movie.  The movie was made for todays modern black woman.  Tiana is a young black girl growing up to believe in her self and to follow her dreams.  When times were difficult she focused on the finish line which was becoming a restaurant owner and not her present dilemma.  Throughout the movie she did not wait on a handout or a man (Prince) to fulfill her goals but when the prince finally came to his senses he realized this beautiful and independent woman was truly a treasure worth giving his heart and love .  Once the prince started acting like a good man Tiana realized there was more to life than business and with a good counterpart they both could love and support each other.<br /><br />Even though I have two girls I would recommend it for boys as well, I would let them know in todays society women are to be respected as a counterpart and not like property such as these tasteless videos.  As they get older just being a true gentlemen that cares about others and is willing to work and follow their own dreams they would be sought after for being the person they are.<br /><br />They you Disney for doing this classic the right way.
B0037W68F4|4.0|congratulations is mgmt's attempt to broaden their musical reach, some apparently dont like that, but to me it is a step forward in maturity. their first album was amazing and easy to access, there were easier songs to sing to along and you could put it on at a party and everyone would like it basically. if you put this album on people may think their listening to a remastered cd of a band from the late 60's or early 70's, which to me isnt a bad thing. in fact i put the cd on my computer and after the last track ended the beatle's \\"ticket to ride\\" came on and i almost thought they had recorded a cover of it! i rated this album a 4 star because i think they can do better, this isnt their masterpiece and neither was o.s.     this album isnt trying to capture the radio listeners that just downloads the released singles off itunes, its trying to be itself and move away from their past and send the band forward in their musical output. mgmt is going to make the music they want to and if you only like songs that the music industry tells you is cool, you can still like this album, just try something that you may not be used to. this album is a mix of post touring beatles, berlin era bowie, and pre meddle era floyd (just a tad), and if you like that stuff you'll really like this album. congratulations on moving forward and maturing mgmt, i look forward to your next album!
B0015UKX7E|4.0|It's a great celebration party in 1999 at Paisley Park Studios, Prince playing \\"1999\\" for the last time! Prince is now a fully devoted Jehovah's witness, his usual sexual overtures are a bit toned down, in \\"Get Off\\" : it's 23 prescriptions in a one-night stand instead of 23 positions in a one-night stand, song being from CD \\"Diamonds And Pearls\\" and the song \\"The Cross\\" from CD \\"Sign O' The Times\\" becomes \\"The Christ\\" . Prince is however magnificent  in guitar & everything else he does, but more concetration on his own music would have made the release even much better (instead of the music of The Time/Lenny Kravitz/George Clinton/Larry Graham/etc). I thought CD \\"Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic\\" (RUTJF) would be well represented as Prince plays the song \\"1999\\" for the last time & promoting his new album RUTJF! Only two songs \\"Greatest Romance\\" & \\"Baby Knows\\" are from RUTJF. Despite these criticisms, Prince is Prince, he really knows how to party like it's 1999 & can present music (his own or others) in ways very few musicians would match! Great release by His Royal Purple Highness supported by great musicians like Lenny Kravitz, Rosie Gaines, Maceo Parker, The Time & many others. It's almost a party of the century but not quite, I give this  DVD only four stars!

0307271862|1.0|Like many Mankell fans I have read and enjoyed all of his Wallander novels.  It was therefore with great disappointment that I read The Man From Beijing. Certainly there is, in the first part, much of Mankell's mystery story-telling genius but when he turns to China the novel takes a serious turn for the worse, to the point of being franky ridiculous.  The (tedious) outline of Chinese history and of contemporary China have all the signs of someone who knows a lot about, well...Africa, anywhere but China.  Fu Manchu might well have been brought into the story and added as much sense to it as much of the other nonsense.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|ok, first of all i have been a fan of gorillaz work since clint eastwood, i bought all of their cd's and have not been disappointed yet. Plastic Beach IS gorillaz. They have always had a tremendous amount of creativity and talent.. I think this cd is the best example of both. I mean it has some smooth beats and crisp lyrics that would appeal to a wide audiance of hiphop fans. It also has the feel of an indy rock cd. I know that when you listen gorillaz the creative stands out and is kind of overwealming for newcommers to the band. I recommend listening to songs two or three times before you pass judgment. My favorite songs on the cd are 5. Stylo, and 9. Some kind of nature. The sound is so unique you have to appreciate the creativity. I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes to experiment with music because this cd is exactly that. In my opinion as far as talentwise plastic beach is gorillaz best work, and has their best collaborations ever.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|Many of the reviews here that complained about the poor cube box design were from the 1st Limited Edition of the Complete Series.<br /><br />The new re-issued Complete Series have much improved individual season digicase design like this:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0036EH3U2/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_1?ie=UTF8&index=1<br /><br />The re-issued Complete Series also includes The Plan as part of the set. All the rest of the Season 1-4 are the same discs as the Limited Edition but doesn't include the Centurian figure.<br /><br />With any well made TV series, the expectation of the fans are much higher than a typical TV series. The show isn't perfect especially the last season but it's hard to find another well made TV series that ended the entire series as well as the Battlestar Galactica. Too many TV series started very good but over the seasons, they got so bad and still continued to make more seasons until the series got canceled without any decent finale.
B0018LX9T4|3.0|Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) finds a job after her release from a mental hospital. She's shy and has a compulsive need to cut herself. Her boss, E. Edward Grey (James Spader) is also a bit nuts - angry outbursts at her pre-computer era typing errors that end up with him posting her errors on the wall, circled in red, spanking her, and her recognizing that she enjoys it. On the other hand, his more constructive efforts alleviate Lee's shyness, and she begins coyly pursuing him. This undermines her original attraction. Eventually he realizes they were made for each other. A bizarre romance.
0670021652|2.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is occasionally witty, but I found her to be mostly uninteresting, self-important, and whiny.<br /><br />This book is mostly about her own experience trying to make peace with marriage-- nay, divorce-- and the writing alternates between personal anecdotes and poorly researched (usually un-cited) facts, histories, and statistics. The most interesting parts were the latter, but I had to slog through the lame parts to get there. I found her own narrative uncompelling. Moreover, it can hardly be used as a source for some non-Elizabeth Gilbert person to come to peace with marriage-- as she openly excuses herself: she is not an anthropologist nor historian.<br /><br />She claims to have been, along with her partner \\"Felipe\\", passionately against the institution of marriage, and yet in reading the book I got the impression that she was more passionately against the institution of divorce. Given that they had already sworn eternal fidelity to one another (in several different ways, including a private ceremony of sorts), it seems that Gilbert's self-centered soul searching was an effort to avoid another painful divorce. Felipe, though also once-bitten-twice-shy, seemed thoroughly happy to get married and settle down.<br /><br />I do pity her for having had to endure a divorce at such a young age, but perhaps a book titled 'Committed' should be about how one is committed to making things work instead of this downer. I would suggest research on conflict resolution, communication, personal finances, child-rearing, housework, and whatever generally drives apart otherwise happy couples rather than her vacuous statistics on which marriages are likely doomed. Maybe that will be her next book. (I get that that wasn't the point of this book-- still, I didn't enjoy the point.)

B00322PKAI|4.0|The watches are all that one expects from Swatch but w/o the Swatch warranty.  The vendor says they have their own warranty and use Swatch for repairs so that it is the same thing, but since I haven't tried it, I don't know.  This was #32 in my current Swatches, and it's the 1st w/o a warranty.  They said that it was because they were cheaper than the dealer, but they weren't; they just had free shipping.

B00008977N|3.0|I bought the video version when it first came out and it is by far my favourite PG video. Best concert ever and one that I missed!!!! This has been played so much that a replacement was long overdue. Unfortunately, the image quality on the dvd is not up to the standard of the video - even an overused one. Having said that, it is my only criticism as it's still a brilliant concert. Even if I had known about the quality, I would still have purchased the dvd - but then, I am a commited fan.
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|[First, read Robert Horton's excellent review (which appears under \\"Editorial Reviews\\" on the product page). It makes this almost redundant.]    Extraordinary pictures! This is a coffee-table movie. You will see things--the quick, far soaking blood of revenge. . .the tribal death vigil which stimulates a living tattoo. . .the choreographed assassins cloaked in black. . .that you have not seen, have not maybe even imagined before.  All that beauty, all that power, though, can't hide an ordinary narrative and an annoying, cloying sentimentality.  But see it, see it!    (Lastly: I was made sad by this thought: In a less visual age than now, our imaginations may have worked like this film. The breadth, the depth of this spectacle used to happen in our minds upon hearing an ordinary told tale. No more, no more. . .but at least we still have our voyeuring eyes.)
B002VPE1AW|1.0|A lot of people get confused and upset when they see a bad rating for a movie that they really liked.  However, they need to be reminded that they are rating the overall product itself and not just writing a movie review.  If I was writing a review for this movie, then it would receive five out of five stars as Cameron has done some pretty amazing stuff.    However...I'm rating the product.    It's already been leaked that this edition will contain just the movie while they are going to release a special edition of it later this year that will contain a bunch of extra stuff including 20 to 40 minutes of footage from the cutting room floor.  So how would I rate this product knowing that a special edition is coming out later?    One star out of five.    The reason why is that a lot of folks who liked the movie well enough but not to the point where they have a new Avatar desktop theme are going to be pretty upset when the special edition is released later this year.  It's this kind of behavior from the film companies that are really starting to upset the consumer and will eventually force some people not to rush out and buy the product right away.  I myself will probably rent this video through Netflix or Redbox, but I won't buy it.    If all you want to see is the theatrical version of the movie sans 3D, then by all means, go ahead and buy this product.  If you are a movie fan like myself, save yourself the time and trouble by waiting a few more months for the special edition.    08/16/10 Edit:  As of today, one person found my review helpful while 12 others said that it wasn't.  Doesn't matter as today I can show why I rated the product the way I did originally.  The movie is being re-released into theaters on August 27 with additional footage.  It appears that the movie companies have taken that extra step to suck more money out of the consumers.  They release a movie in theaters, then on DVD, then re-release it in theaters with additional footage, and then sell the extended version on DVD.    Again, if I was rating the movie, it would have gotten a five out of five stars.  This product, packaged as is, is nothing more than a capitalistic venture wrapped in the cloak of greed.  I still have not purchased this movie (even at the rental store where they are selling used copies for $4.99) simply because I knew that this edition was coming out.

0316154687|4.0|Another hilarious collection of essays by David Sedaris. This was another book that I read aloud to my husband. A lot of this book had to be read in private though, and not around relatives. It's definitely adult reading and adult language!<br /><br />The portraits he paints of every day people doing things that are absolutely crazy in a way that makes them seem mundane is his calling card and he does this to excellent effect in this new novel. Whether it's the woman that lives alone in an apartment building that acts like she runs the place (and really does), the crazy people he hitchhikes with in the early 70's, his parent's take on art, or the people he meets in his attempt to quit smoking in japan, it's all written with a humorous edge and a sarcastic wit that makes even the most outcast and odd palatable.<br /><br />There were several parts where he seemed to go over the edge beyond funny into really being almost sad, pathetic, or even hateful. But, the rest of the book is so well written and his humor continues to be so endearing that you can't help forgiving it as you continue on.<br /><br />When You Are Engulfed In Flames is an excellent, strange, but very well written series of comedic looks into David Sedaris' life and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to read some fun, short, true stories by NPR's funniest voice in comedy.
030726999X|5.0|This is a thriller with a moral purpose which sets it above similar series centering on conspiracy and intrigue. The central theme here is violence against women and the willingness of society to allow it.<br /><br />The best part of this series is its positive portrayal of women. None of the major female characters in this trilogy are pawns or glamorous sidekicks to their male counterparts. Berger is an intelligent crusading editor. Figuerola, Linder and Modig are admirable police officers. Giannini proves herself a proficient advocate. Salander is both victim and heroine. All of these women are portrayed sympathetically, as are the portrayals of their various professions.<br /><br />There's enough suspense and action to satisfy most readers. But, above all else, this is a character-driven novel.<br /><br />Though Larsson does a commendable job of wrapping up the trilogy, this third novel in the series is not a standalone. The first hundred pages or so are an attempt to fill in what happened before, but I think reading the first two is necessary to fully understand what is going on.<br /><br />I savored this re-acquaintance with Salander, Blomkvist and the other characters. Like so many other fans, my biggest regret is Larsson did not live to give us more.

B002ZG983M|4.0|If you initially thought (thanks to the trailers having to be approved for all audiences) that Kick-ass would be a potential Razzie-award winning spoof on the same level as Disaster Movie, Dance Flick, Meet the Spartans, and just about every *insert type of movie here* movie that is released nowdays (one word for those cinematic _____mongers: UGH), don't feel bad if you did.  I did too.  When I first saw the trailer for Kick-ass, my mind went along the lines of \\"why does the movie industry keep making these spoof movies!\\".  I really did think the movie would be another lame spoof movie or a half-@$$ed superhero comedy for children.<br /><br />Instead, what I got was a endlessly entertaining (the movie took no time to ramp up), violent, foul-mouthed comic joyride, both making fun of comic books and at the same time being a serious superhero movie (albeit with a zany Red Bull bend). I admit that it took me the R-Rating and an uncensored preview when realizing what it really was: A violent, often hilarious, and almost Tarantino-ish superhero flick, both serious, funny, and gloriously over the-top.  So much for first impressions.  It's much more than that, and It's certainly the movie I've been waiting for this year, considering how dire the year of 2010 has been for films (the new Scorsese movie was a two and a half hour rejected Twilight Zone episode, at best).<br /><br />A comparison that is already swirling around is a mixture of Spider-man and Kill Bill, and as my namesake probably suggests, it appeared to my Tarantino senses and delivered some thrilling action sequences.  The action is stylized in a way that would make the man himself very proud.  Most funny are the riffs on comic books, such as Dave's first attack that surely shows him why many people don't don costumes in the first place.  However, if you are a fan of superhero films, comic books, and take them seriously, don't worry, Kick-Ass doesn't spit on your past time, either.  Despite some of the satirical jokes regarding comic books in general, Kick-Ass is still a genuine superhero film at heart.  Kick-ass doesn't turn into a cynical satire with a \\"Superheroes are totally fake and your an idiot for getting into them\\" message.  The superheros are also internally motivated (Big Daddy and Hitgirl are both victims of murder), which helps the film seem more like a real superhero film, than just a satire on the world of comics.<br /><br />I'm sure Kick-Ass might get some criticism as being a movie that has nothing to offer besides shock-value.  As far as shock value goes, I wouldn't quite go for that, especially if you've seen such movies as Cannibal Holocaust, but this movie doesn't need shock value (ask Tom Green).  You'll laugh when it's funny, and be energized by the violence of the movie, not shocked by it.  That's the reason why it's great, it's more than just shock value, it's pure fun, like the rollercoaster type of feeling.  When we ride rollercoasters, we don't think of the negative emotions and how tough we will look, we think of how much pure fun were having.  That's how the R worthy content in this movie should be approached.<br /><br />Some of the humor falls flat, as I found some (SOME, people) of the raunchy humor to be kind of hackneyed, such as the scene in the beginning regarding self-stimulation.  It wasn't like Superbad, where most of the raunchy jokes were laugh out loud hilarious and quite creative, at least in my opinion.  They were thought out, not their for some cheap laughs.  Thankfully, these kind of jokes are kept to a minimum with great use of timing and swearing in the dialogue.  As you probably have heard by now, the 11 year old (at the time) Chloe Moertz steals the show here, as the violent 11 year old teenage girl with the mouth of a sailor and the maturity of a person much older than her age.  Another funny performance, well performances, I found were the mobsters, as their foul-mouthed, deliberately crude dialogue got a lot of laughs from me.  Lot's of the situations are funny as well, as I found the scene where they put the man in the trash compactor to be darkly hilarious.<br /><br />I for one am not a great fan of Superhero movies (some people really love them and get into the backstories and characters much more than I do.  They really do treat them like Greek Mythology), but I do enjoy them and I must say that Kick-Ass is one of the most enjoyable superhero films I've seen, much more than movies like X-men or Superman Returns (though I list those for personal preferences, I have nothing wrong with those movies).  You'll get your money worth, and you'll have a Kick-ass time (sorry).  This movie is sure to become a cult classic someday, and like most cult movies, it will hit home for the right kind of viewer.  Either way, don't miss Kick-Ass.ns are funny as well, as I found the scene where they put the man in the trash compactor to be darkly hilarious.

0792164903|5.0|Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci star in Tim Burton's macabre version of Washington Irving's very short story \\"The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.\\" Let me say upfront, that I never have, and don't intend to, read the source material, as it looks boring. The script considerably expands on Irving's characters and moody atmosphere. The movie is very well directed by the Master Of Idiosyncrasy, Tim Burton (see \\"Edward Scissorhands,\\" a bittersweet love story, or<br />\\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street,\\" a stylish and operatic \\"Kill Bill\\" set in Victorian England). The performances in this movie are first-rate, from Johnny Depp & Christina Ricci right down to the child actor who plays Young Masbath. I love the tender moments in the film (when Katrina holds Young Masbath in her arms and when she holds Ichabod in her arms); those are my favourite bits. What else can I say? I'm very sentimental. The suspense is chilling, and the ending will shock you. When you think, you know what will happen next, think again. Very complex and intriguing gem of a film. I won't say more, lest I give away the plot. \\"Heads Will Roll.\\"<br /><br />The special features are quite interesting, beginning with a Making of featurette, and exclusive cast and crew interviews, which are very thorough. However, I think Christopher Lee and Martin Landau should have also been interviewed, as their roles were very small, but significant to the plot of the movie. Also, I'm somewhat disappointed that some scenes in the trailer (and lines of dialogue heard in the Making of featurette) were not in the movie or included as deleted scenes on the DVD.<br /><br />I highly recommend the film. It's worth repeated viewings to fully understand the complex (but well defined) plot. It deserved the R rating, for graphic horror violence and gore, and a scene of sexuality.
0307278255|4.0|What surprised me the most about Lahiri's stories is that they are written mainly in narration; that is, these are not stories filled with action. They are thoughtful, insightful stories about the human condition. In particular, Lahiri covers the immigrant's saga -- culture clashes, the adjustments made or not made, the need to fit in, the desire for a better life in America. Touching, tender, and although not a page-turner, you cannot put the book down until you reach the end.

0385528752|3.0|\\"Switch\\" oscillates between the citation of psychological research and the slightly-suspect relaying of 'inspirational anecdotes' (as is de rigeur for this genre), but is, on the whole, a worthwhile read. Coming across as a self-help version of [[ASIN:014311526X Nudge]], the authors wield an array of techniques to help people create change in their lives as painlessly as possible. In doing so, they indirectly provide an evidential basis for David Allen's \\"Next Action\\" mantra, as suggested in [[ASIN:0142000280 Getting Things Done]], but their focus is neither on the \\"nuts and bolts\\" of organisational management (which can lead to meta-productivity fetishism, as many GTD converts are prone to), nor on the sort of \\"flying with the eagles\\" nonsense that keeps Anthony Robbins in a mansion in Hawaii. Instead, the authors try and strike a balance between social psychology and \\"change your life\\" blue sky thinking. For the most part, they succeed admirably, and their approach ends up leading them to more sensible suggestions than the interesting -but wacky- [[ASIN:0307273407 59 Seconds]] which itself purports to be based on hard science (or, at least, as \\"hard science\\" as psychological research can be). For those who like their self help rooted strongly in scientific research, I would probably recommend this alongside [[ASIN:0979777747 Brain Rules]], but own it's own, Switch is still a worthwhile addition to the burgeoning genre of self-help-based-on-academic-research genre.
B001EYU1VO|2.0|This stick is not even worth $40 IMHO.<br /><br />First out of the box, trying to adjust the head angle and stick height a washer fell out, not sure where it came from or what it held up but it broke while loosening the screw with the included tool. After you break off some washers adjusting the stick to something usable you will be greeted by some driver madness in win 7, come on CH sticks are plug and play why did I have to go to the support forum to figure out that the drivers won't load from the CD it ships with for win 7.<br /><br />Well so lets try some old school cfs 3 or falcon, it did take the sticks profile and use it well but the stick is tooo stiff with the wobbling head just makes it too difficult as a sim stick, even casually. The wobble is caused by how they allow for the adjustments, which is nice that you can adjust the stick but not nice that it wobbles so much. Now add the stiff springs and not so sensitive  sensors with the wobble and you'll under stand what I mean, you actually think your turning the stick when your just making the head wobble about with no input to the stick itself. Now that you realize your not going any where you put some more force into it and then the stiff spring makes you have to push it all the way just to get the plane to bank. Come on Saitek you guys are supposed to know better than this.<br /><br />When I read the other reviews about it lifting from the table I was thinking they were fps gamers hammer fisting the stick, but now as I am using it in a flight sim it does the same, you can get it to raise off the desk with our lil finger trying to use the hat switch.

Those kids grow into awkward adolescents who live in dorms in Uglyville, counting down the days until their sixteenth birthdays.<br /><br />The day an Ugly turns sixteen, he or she is whisked away for the surgery that will turn him or her Pretty.  Then the fixed-up adolescent will be allowed to live in New Pretty Town across the bridge, where the only necessary tasks are looking great and attending all of the best parties before growing up into a Middle Pretty and settling down with a partner and a career.<br /><br />Tally is sad and lonely that her best friend, Peris, has turned sixteen and turned pretty before her.  She can think of nothing except her own birthday and joining him in New Pretty Town.  Then she meets Shay.  Shay is also approaching her sixteenth birthday, but has confided that she doesn't want to turn pretty.  In fact, she knows of a small village of rebels who ran away rather than having the surgery.  Nothing seems more horrifying to Tally, but Shay is convinced that keeping her own face is important.<br /><br />I liked the concept behind this book, and really liked the setup for the next story.  I liked the idea of our current civilization breaking down and being replaced by something else, and of the ruins of our cities being fascinating for the children of the future.<br /><br />I didn't much like Tally herself.  She was whiny and allowed herself to be thrown into situations instead of making choices about what she wanted.  She was stronger at the end of the book, which is a good sign that she might continue to grow throughout the series.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Sony's stuck with their controller design since the mid-90s, and regardless of the criticism they've gotten for it, it's a design that works. The Dualshock is comfortable, light, and the buttons are all easily accessible. With this newest version, it's wireless, so no more cords in the way! The Dualshock 3 looks nearly identical to the previous two models, but with the obvious PlayStation button in the center, and the L2 and R2 triggers being more triggers than buttons now. But there are a few irks that I still have with the design that I doubt will be corrected, at least directly by Sony.    Everyone knows how the controller is, so I don't really need to go into the pros. But I might as well just to seem like I'm not bashing the controller, even if it gets a good rating from me. Comfort, well-spaced buttons, pressure sensitivity even for the d-pad, and no lag (some wireless controllers have this still). The cons however, which seem to be only pointed out by me and a handful of people, keep this from being a perfect controller. First, I hate the d-pad. It sucks for most fighting games like BlazBlue and Street Fighter, like doing special move configurations. I still can't do Shoryuken motions without screwing up on a regular basis because the directional buttons are separate. How hard is it to connect the buttons together so you can get one smooth flowing motion? The Xbox S controller's d-pad was perfect, and playing Guilty Gear X2 #Reload was so effortless, you'd think Sony would've borrowed from that aspect of Microsoft's design. This is really the only genre, at least that I've played, that suffers from the d-pad, and it's good for every other kind of game. But my other complaint is that the analog sticks still feel too loose to me. Every other analog stick, from the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, Xbox and even GameCube, feel perfect and tight, but Sony's tend to run on the loose side. Playing LittleBigPlanet, which uses the analog stick instead of the d-pad [like it should] was something that took the fun out of that game for me.    There's one more con, but it has nothing to do with the controller itself. It's that no controller recharging cable is included. Yep, if you lost the one that came with your ps3, you're not getting an extra one here. Also, and this one's really minor and only for the super picky people, but someone's gotta mention it, the controls when watching a dvd and a Blu-Ray are different. I don't get why they did that, but if you watch a dvd and then go for a blu-ray, prepare to adjust to different settings for the buttons' quick actions without going to the menu.    Some people complain that the Dualshock 3 needs to be recharged too quickly, 'only' lasting 4-5 hours before needing to recharge. I used to play games a lot, and now I'm down to -maybe- 2 hours per sitting, but 4-5 hours seems a bit long to me, so it needing to recharge after that much time seems reasonable. This is a good controller, and while third party companies have made versions with the d-pad design I like, the overall quality lacks compared to what Sony puts out.
B00371QQ0M|2.0|After devouring the entire Dune series I really looked forward to the film. In some ways it is quite nice. The special effects & all of the obvious, up front - surface - material is well done. (though \\"special effects\\" rarely wear well with age and depending on them to drive a story isn't the smartest directorial decision if longevity and/or timelessness is a consideration. But who am I kidding? How often are those matters considered?) On the other hand anything that required a bit of thinking - philosophic issues, non-spectacular matters that are important to the core of the saga, maybe slightly more than casual reading  - simply was left out. Herbert's tales are a joy to read. I remember savoring each one, looking forward to the next installment & ultimately being incredibly depressed when he died before giving us some sort of satisfying finale. This film just doesn't do justice to Dune.

B002ZG983M|5.0|\\"Kick-Ass\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Dave Lizewski, a comic-book fanboy, decides to take his obsession as inspiration to become a real-life superhero. As any good superhero would, he chooses a new name -- Kick-Ass -- assembles a suit and mask to wear, and gets to work fighting crime. There's only one problem standing in his way: Kick-Ass has absolutely no superpowers. His life is forever changed as he inspires a subculture of copy cats, is hunted by assorted violent and unpleasant characters, and meets up with a pair of crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old sword-wielding dynamo, Hit Girl and her father, Big Daddy.

B003405MF6|4.0|Emotion and Commotion is another excellent addition to Jeff Beck's catalogue of inspired music and as usual he has not given us what we expected. I have always loved Jeff Beck's unique style of playing and have always found his albums to be interesting and musically satisfying. He plays with such feel and the melodies come alive. I think it was Steve Lukather who said \\"God plays through Jeff Beck's hands\\" and although I'm not religious I understand that feeling you get when listening to Jeff Beck pouring his emotion out through his guitar. The production on this album is the best of his career with nice synth backings, lush orchestral arrangements, and sophisticated playing by the likes of Vinnie Colaiuta. What a great year for guitar lovers with albums from Steve Morse, Jeff Beck, and the soon to be released album by Steve Lukather too. Highly recommended - solid 4.5 stars.

B001UHOWXI|5.0|The movie It's a Wonderful Life goes without saying, is one of the most heartwarming classics ever made. \\"Capricorn\\" as it has been dubbed by some critics, is in my opinion without much merit.

I am viewing this on a Pioneer elite \\"Kuro\\" 60\\" plasma, and , if you have seen the original transfers you will be amazed how beautiful and detailed this latest transfer is. Such depth and clarity. The audio is mono , and quite frankly it is fine in that mode.

THIS IS THE ONE TO GET! Highly recommended.

I'm sure the dancers were completley devastated by his passing, knowing they went thru all that 4 nothing.  But they seemed super phony anywayz so I didn't care either way.  I still think Prince is a better overall entertainer than Michael jackson.  He never seems 2 garnish any respect like MIchael Jackson, even tho he's a MUSICIAN.

Living on Long Island, where many of his stories take place, I know they are spot on geographically & by description, as well.<br />The author tells this story very well. It's long, but not boring by any means. His characters are developed very well. They almost pop off the pages at you.<br />I know Plum Island & the surrounding North Fork areas well, right down to Claudio's. Mr. DeMille takes the true accurate description and leads the reader into thinking the crux of the story revolves around the actual goings on at Plum Island.<br />He then gently switches gears and the reader discovers the real reason behind the murders & mayhem. It becomes a novel which one hates to have end.<br />I've always thought John Corey, the main character, a bit over the top with his corny jokes. I think DeMille needs to tone him down. But, that's minor
B002ZG983M|1.0|I'm convinced there's a class of artist who'd crap on the Mona Lisa, and then have the nerve to show it to you convinced that they're an artistic genius and have much improved on the original. What's sad is there are those who'd agree with them.  Who'd go \\"Oh you're such a brilliant artist, how do you do it?\\"  Unfortunately the artwork in question hasn't changed; it just has a bunch of crap on it now.    This sort of thing has happened in any number of movies based on original works. \\"The Black Cauldron\\" by Lloyd Alexander, \\"The Mist\\" by Steven King, to name just a couple, and I really wonder what they were thinking when they took these brilliant original works and created drivel I'd rather rip my eyeballs out then watch. What do best selling authors know about plot development anyway? Obviously nothing. What's saddest is I'm sure the directors are still congratulating themselves on how brilliant they are.    Well the same thing has happened with Kick Ass the movie. The first quarter was ok, it stuck to the original with a few minor changes, like deleting the important torture scene and the scene when three teenage girls threaten to cut his penis off because they think he's a pervert in his costume, that I'd have liked to see.           After that it goes to hell. In the graphic novel the crime boss instantly realizes that poor wimpy Kick Ass isn't the one killing his men. In the movie contrary to all evidence he's convinced that Kick Ass is killing his men. This sends everything down a strange path and the surprise identity of Red Mist not only isn't a surprise but is done to death for no reason I can see because he wasn't an interesting character. It gets worse. In the graphic novel the beautiful girl he has a crush on has her boyfriend beat him up when she finds out he's not gay. In the movie they end up having lots of sex. You tell me what's more likely to happen to a comic book geek in high school?  Sure.           The ending was annihilated. The surprise revelation of Big Daddy's true identity was cut out completely. The inevitable fight scenes were hopelessly contrived. Hello Hit Girl your fathers on fire you should put him out now.  I have no idea what that was about. Hit Girl was the only high point in this horrible movie. She was quite adorable as an eleven year old killer.  You might want to see the movie just to see her in action, but for gods sakes don't waste any money on it.           I'm convinced that if they'd been faithful to the original graphic novel this could have been as good as Sin City, as it is it's a joke filled with pointless action stupid dialogue and a senseless plot, and I'm sure the director responsible is congratulating himself on what a great job he did.
0767811070|5.0|Very good movie about life in South Central La during the 1980's and early 1990's.  Good movie about gangbangers and the live they live.
B000002B7O|5.0|Looking for Metal?  First of all, forget the '02 remix with the phony-baloney bass & drums -- there were no \\"extra tracks\\" in 1981, anyway.  In addition to the legendary Osbourne/Rhoads assault, some sort of witchcraft flows between Daisley/Kerslake on 'Diary'.  The hair on the back of your neck will stand up at least 10 times during the course of this album, guaranteed...
0684830485|3.0|The book is fine enough though not what I had expected.  Some of the wording in the description led me to expect something else.  Also the interior of the package was absolutely filthy with something that appeared to be paper insulation.  I got a face full of dust when I opened it.  When I contacted the dealer about it he made excuses and said the package was clean when he shipped it.  No it wasn't!  The filth was INSIDE a sealed envelope.  Really disappointing!!  I expected better from Amazon.  anza66, I won't buy from you again.  I will look for other ways to purchase used reading material.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I went into this with curiosity seeing if it would be anything like Twilight (which I despise!) and I was pleased to see that it was hardly anything like it. Great character development, captivating storylines and a great mystery. Most shows have a hard time keeping up momentum throughout the season but this one has, to the point where you feel like you've made significant progress in the story watching it from the beginning to the end of each episode. Everyone in it is gorgeous and I still don't know whether I'm Team Damon or Team Stefan.     If you like vampire stuff, obviously, you'll love this but if you mostly hate vampire stuff, you'll probably still love it because it's got so much story beyond just focusing on being a vampire. Can't wait until this is released on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B002VPE1B6|1.0|Avatar was an exciting movie. Don't get me wrong, but this review pertains to the Blu Ray product, not the movie itself.  The April 22nd release is the \\"Let's get all the suckers\\" edition which will contain ONLY the movie. It does not contain special features, behind the scenes footage, or anything of that nature.  If your garden consists of money that grows on trees then I would say, \\"Go ahead and buy this blu ray.\\"     The Ultimate edition will arrive later this year, with a 3d version next year. It's better to wait and not get caught up in the Avatar hype.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|My family just returned from London where we saw Love Never Dies at the Adelphi.  I had heard the cd before seeing the show and was impressed with both.  My wife and teenage son and daughter had not heard the cd before seeing the show, but they also really enjoyed it.   The cast is excellent, the visuals are really beautiful and we found the story quite interesting.  When Sierra Boggess sings the title tune near the end of the play you are blown away - amazing voice.  Highly recommended.

030014332X|4.0|Gombrich delivers what he promises, \\"A Little History.\\"  To a reviewer who is a reader, rather than a historian, the book conveys to young students a story with a conscience, but not with a politically correct agenda, which pleases this reader in spades.  It is meant to be read aloud to the student, presumably by a parent or teacher.  It is conversational, it doesn't pander or speak down to the audience, it occasionally asks a question, or throws in a comment.  First published in 1936 - the lazy reviewer neglects to determine the number of printings- in the German, the little classic (280 pages) was translated into English in 2005.  That should attest to someone's idea of the work's worthiness.  Although meant for kids, Gombrich writes as if at least some of the material had come to the student's attention before.  Few words need to be defined, there is no overload of names or dates, and a few maps are included.  It is apparent that Grombrich was writing for a student whose standards were more demanding than in today's America.  It would be a shock to this reviewer's system to find that fifty per cent of contemporary high school seniors would pass a test covering the material in \\"A Little History.\\"  Alas. The work is Euro-centric, as the author acknowledges.  The American Civil War gets less than one page of treatment.  But it works within the context of Western civilization, Gombrich's focus. Gombrich revised the material while in his nineties, during the 1990's.  He commented on a couple of shortcomings contained in the original work, and his effort to correct them, which speaks well for his ethics.  Who is ready to hear this book?  A very bright eight or nine-year-old, perhaps, especially if the emphasis is put on the idea that it is a student's first pass, revealing a very big picture.  Multiple readings might be useful as the student ages.  I should have given it five stars.
0307386171|5.0|I read On Chesil Beach while on my honeymoon about a year and a half ago, and it still haunts me.  I read it in one sitting while lying on the beach with my new husband sitting next to me staring off into space and ordering us cocktails. I'll be wanting to re-read this wonderful little book soon, I'm sure. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves serious literature. But be forewarned that you may find yourself tearing up by the end.  As another reviewer noted, McEwen makes us all too aware of how close our couple's happiness was, and of how small acts and minor misunderstandings can have devastating, long lasting, and irreversible consequences.
B003AYZBGQ|2.0|I've read and enjoyed several of Michael Lewis' books.  From what I'm seeing on several internet sites, I have 2 issues:  1, Mr. Lewis was a very enthusiastic supporter of Kindle in a 5 minute discussion on Youtube in 2007, but he is unwilling to launch his new book on Kindle. Why???......$$$$$ to ML and his publisher.  2, It appears that Mr lewis was a supporter in 2007 of the financial instruments that contributed to the financial meltdown only one year later.  He, along with most of us, was naive and did not understand the potential economic and personal ramifications of these unregulated financial creations.  I'm not sure if he addresses this in his book.    I'll look forward to read the book if and when it is available on kindle, but I am disappointed with his position about not making his book available on the kindle, and possibly his lack of financial acumen re derivatives.

B0021L8UQ2|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be another boring movie but after watching it WOW. It was a huge shock it was actually a very good movie. I didnt expect it to be as good as it was. Well worth the buy.
0440238609|4.0|I have to say I was a little embarrassed when the bookstore associate led me to the kids section to find these books. However, don't let the trilogy's classification deter you from reading this series. There is a lot of mature content in the story. The book \\"The Golden Compass\\" is much better than the movie. In the feature film there are a lot of inaccuracies that take away from the piece. If you have an imagination and you love to escape to made up worlds, then you will love His Dark Materials. It won't take much reading before you find yourself wanting a demon of your own. In the second book I was captivated by the complicated storyline. There are many narratives going on at once, but it is easy to keep up. The third book fascinated me. If you are a devout anything then you should only read this book to cite its blasphemy. This series received a lot flak from whatever religions (I can't keep track of them all) but I loved the new concepts and creativity this author used. He paints a whole different picture of God and Heaven. He has a wonderful perspective. There are creative creatures throughout the books, some of which are completely new to the world of fiction. With all the big trilogies that have been written, it is hard to find new books that don't seem like a spin off, but I guarantee you haven't read anything like this before. When I finished the books I was sad there wasn't any more to read. Enjoy this emotional tale of the bravest young girl to ever be created. She will convince you that being a liar is a good thing.

B00012QM8G|3.0|Schindler's List was a terribly difficult movie to watch because it was one of the most true to life movie's of the Holocaust I have seen. The movie is a gripping tale of the transformation of one man, Oskar Schindler, who turned into someone who saved the lives of almost 1100 Jewish men and woman from the horror of the concentration camps. Because of this man, there are more than 6000 descendants alive today. He began as a man who was concentrating on making a fortune from the slave labor of thousands of Jews. As he began to form a relationship with his business manager and other Jews working in his factory he began to realize the horror of what was really going on. He formed many relationships with the Nazi's which allowed him to bribe them into getting preferential treatment of his business manager and eventually the release of all of his employees. Meanwhile, the movie depicted the horrible tale of what the Jewish men and women went through during the Holocaust. The movie truly made you feel the pain, horror and anguish of the Jews as they tried to live and adapt to what was happening to them. I thought the best part of this entire movie was the very end in which you learned that the Jews 'working' in Schindler's ammunition factory did not make one thing that could be used or even worked. He also kept the guards out of the factory so that word would not get back to their supervisor's that Schindler was in fact protecting those who worked for him.  This movie definitely makes me wonder how the Jews held onto their faith when it was the very reason they were killed and treated like animals. It's a wonder that those who survived still held strong to their faith and continue to today. The Holocaust will undoubtedly be something that will forever affect the Jewish community.
0525421580|4.0|When you combine two rock star authors like John Green and David Levithan together you start to get really high hopes for sure. Well, I did at least. Since, for one, I ADORE John Green's books and while I haven't read anything by David Levithan before ( I know, I'm bad) I've heard some really great things about him. And for two, the premise for this? Kick-butt! I mean, how cool would it be to meet someone with the SAME exact name as you? I think very!    So, as I began this, I had abnormally high hopes for a book that contained rock-my-socks amazingness, and while it did live somewhat up to my expectations, I have to say that I was just a wee bit disappointed. Because quite honestly, I've read better books than Will Grayson, Will Grayson this year (cue sad face). Though don't get me wrong, it was good.    For instance I really liked the two protagonists.    Willy Grayson #1, who I'm pretty sure was written by Green, was hilarious, charming, and just out right adorable with his geekiness and his wanting to stay under the radar. Plus, his friendship with Tiny was inspiring and something that made you think of you're best friend and how lucky you are to have them.     Will Grayson #2, who was written by Levithan probably, was the darker and moodier of the two, so it did take a bit longer to warm up to him, but once you did, you couldn't help but have this wanting to tell him that he shouldn't be so hard of himself and that he was amazing even if he didn't always see it.    Though, my favorite character was Tiny, without a doubt. Because he was just an easy guy to adore and I think anyone could relate to his wanting/need to be told that he was appreciated and loved.     The plot and writing were straight forward and easy to get caught up leaving it to be very easy to get caught right up in the Will Graysons' story. But with that being said, I felt that Will Grayson, Will Grayson was missing a big bang moment that truly had you on your toes, which is the reason why thiswasn't as loved by me as I thought it was going to be. Since, quite honestly, when I read a book as highly as anticipated as this one was, I want a big bang moment that makes me go WOW.     The aspect, though, that gave me gave me hope again was the messages it had of acceptance and love among many that made Will Grayson, Will Gryason to be poignant and inspiring, a book that even with it's faults, I still recommend you go out and buy because it is good. Just not fantastic.    Oh, and I think it goes without saying that I will be reading more by the amazing John Gree and some of Levithan, too!     Grade: B

1400034205|4.0|I read this book as part of my book club.  We choose classic reads once a year and The Razors Edge was our choice this year.  It was a very popular book when it was written and still seems relevant even today.  At times the dialog was mundane, but keeping in mind when this was written and the ease of the language at the time,  I gave the author some grace for a simplistic story compared to today's stories of problems and complicated story-lines.    We watched the movie by the same title after reading the book and it was fun to see classic acting and some changes in the screen play.  The movie portrayed Larry as a rather \\"hero\\" who was everything to everyone.  However, I saw Larry as selfish and self-absorbed in the book.  He never seemed to commit to anyone or anything.  He was always searching for something newer or better.  The book and movie was good for book club discussion, as was the life and writings of Somerset Maugham.  He should be recognized for his contributions as a great american writer.    The last 10 pages of the book were the most important.  In these pages Somerset Maugham seems to bring together the reason he choose to write this book about these characters.  In the end, it is a book of how these people found what they were looking for and how that impacted their lives.  Keeping this in mind while reading the beginning of the book will help the reader understand the direction of this writing style.  Enjoy this light hearted read of traditional americans set in the early 20th century.
B000IU3XTW|3.0|Skin and Bones being a live accoustic album with Foo Fighters and was released 2006. The booklet contains many photographs from the live concerts but apart from this it is quite sparse. In fact one could accuse Sony BMG of being a bit cheap since we get no linernotes and the photographs look like a friend of the band shot them and not a professional photographer. Allmusic and Rolling Stone both gave the album 3/5 in their reviews. 3/5.

0060574216|5.0|[[ASIN:0060574216 Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus: The Classic Guide to Understanding the Opposite Sex]]    I am an engineer who had zero insight into girls and women growing up, much less emotions later on. After a divorce and going into the dating scene, I needed serious help.     John Gray's book was the first I read cover-to-cover. The subjects were truly eye-opening and stated in a way that I understood, both from a female's viewpoint and from a guy's. I gained a vocabulary and insight which started a change in my life that existed through to today and into a strong second marriage 15 years-later.     There is a lot more that went on in my life than this book, but the book was a pivot point for a person who literally could not empathize with the other sex - I was stone cold ignorant.     To this day, I think of phrases and descriptions that Gray used to describe guys \\"going into their caves\\" or women needing to talk about problems without wanting solutions (the way a guy does). If you already understand that, maybe you don't need this book - but I sure didn't.    It even provided me critical insight into my understanding about how to relate to my daughter. To this day, I use skills that I've learned from that book when listening to or relating to my adult daughter.     I am buying this book for my 21-year old son as part of a graduating college collection of books (sort of a \\"Things you need in Real Life Collection\\") that I think will be really beneficial for him. Fortunately he reads quite a lot, provided he's interested in the topic and he has a girlfriend, so I hope this will be of interest.
B002ZBT84G|5.0|After waiting so many years to hear new music from Gil Scott-Heron --- one of my very favorite artists/musicians/poets/singers ---- I was both eager, and scared, when I herar this album was being released. I read all the stuff about his \\"ravaged\\" voice and the shortness of this album, and the lack of \\"new\\" material, but that wasn't going to stop me from buying it. And I'm glad I did; this is great stuff. Maybe his voice doesn't quite have the same depth and dynamics it used to, but to my ears it's still powerful, and so are these songs. Okay, maybe it's not accurate to call everything on this album \\"songs,\\" but these tracks, or pieces, or whatever you wanna call them, are very haunting and moving. This album is a definite keeper in my collection. I needed to hear this. And I think all Gil Scott-Heron fans should do likewise. We need this man. Welcome back!
0375704027|3.0|Hard to gauge whether it is the translation or the story itself that comes across so weak in this novel.  There is a flatness to the storytelling that belies the emotions Murakami appears to want convey, but I assumed that to be the way he felt when he was in his 20s, trying to sort through a handful of young women and one older woman as to what he was looking for in the way of a relationship.  The story is told through the eyes of Watanabe, a college student on the verge of turning 20, wrestling with his affections for two women, Naoka and Midori, the death of a high school friend, and his own insecurities during a cultural revolution of sorts in Japan in 1969.<br /><br />Confusion mounts during the course of the narration, especially in regard to Naoka, who checks herself into a mountain retreat after one night with Watanabe.  Seems Naoka is also having a difficult time coming to grips with the death of their mutual friend, her sister, and life in general, and feels she needs help coping with these matters.  Meanwhile, Watanabe is left to struggle with emotions in Tokyo, which soon become sublimated in Midori, whose openness he seems to enjoy but can't bring himself to commit to her.  After several failed attempts he finally reaches Naoka, and the reader is treated to a wonderful description of the Kyoto region, and meets an odd older woman, who Naoka has now confided in, and in whose guitar we hear the weeping strains of \\"Norwegian Wood.\\"<br /><br />It is really more a collection of stories loosely held together by the sense of displacement Murakami projects in his characters.  In that sense it is similar to [[ASIN:0375713271 After the Quake]] but with a continuation of the same characters.  The chapters take each set of emotions in turn, ranging from a scant 15 to over 100 pages in length.  The stories are certainly compelling, but the sense of detachment is a bit off putting, and the ending for me defied all credulity.  It appeared tacked on.<br /><br />The emotions seem real enough but why Murakami chose to end his story this way really surprised me.  Of course, he projects the sense of loss by noting that he is looking back on these events as he plunges through a dense cloud bank on his way into Hamburg airport.  There is a post-modern feeling to this novel which annoyed me, as it explores emotions only so deep as to give you some kind of sense for what the characters may have been feeling, but juxtaposes them in ways that all too often seem at odds with each other.  Literary allusions abound in this novel, most notably Thomas Mann and F. Scott Fitzgerald.  You get the sense that not only Watanabe, but the author is unsure of himself as he explores these currents of emotions, trying to make sense of the feelings he had back in '69.gh but why Murakami chose to end his story this way really surprised me.

B002XMGGJM|4.0|How far would you go in order to fix a justice system that is so broken it would allow some evil to go relatively unpunished? That question is the driving force behind the newest action thriller from director F. Gary Gray (\\"Four Brothers\\"), \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\", starring Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx.    \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" is the story of a family man named Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) whose entire life is torn apart when his wife and young daughter are brutally murdered in front of him. Seeking justice through the legal system, Clyde is shocked when he learns that up-and-coming Philadelphia prosecutor, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) has cut a deal with one of the killers in order to get a confession and heftier sentence for the other offender. Ten years pass by, and mysteriously the two killers are murdered and Clyde is more than happy to confess to their grisly deaths. However, their deaths were only the beginning as Clyde issues an ultimatum that will shake Philadelphia and its arrogant prosecutor to their core.    When the premise of a movie is an attempt to right the wrongs of the legal system, what are the chances that the movie remains realistic? By my estimation, the likelihood of such an absurdly sounding concept for a movie succeeding is slim to none. Surprisingly, this twisted morality tale written by Kurt Wimmer (\\"Equilibrium\\") never becomes an exercise in absurdity, although there are a few moments where one does begin to wonder if it might.    Assisting in keeping the film on track is the fact that the story moves along at a brisk pace. Thus, the audience is never really allowed time to fully contemplate the semi-ridiculous nature of the premise. I mean are we really going to believe that one man can change the legal system, seriously? Besides that the characters are very well written, effectively gaining your interest from the very beginning. The two leads alone provide some very entertaining verbal sparring sessions throughout the duration. If the characters hadn't been handled in such a captivating and true-to-life manner then I doubt the story could have succeeded in remaining grounded in some semblance of reality.    Of course, what would an action thriller be without great action sequences? Well, it would be rather boring, obviously. The action set pieces in this film are so elaborately designed, with great attention to detail, that you can't help but be impressed by the sheer creativity on display. The ingenuity within these scenes made the movie even more engaging for me. Had the action been handled in a lazy manner, resulting in a run-of-the-mill series of explosions or gunfights, the movie would have quickly begun to lose its appeal. After all, who wants to see the same old crap over and over again? Certainly not me, but that's what so many of these action movies tend to throw at us, but thankfully \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" does not fall prey to this particular pratfall.    Bringing the mayhem to life is Hollywood's current reigning \\"It\\" guy, Gerard Butler (\\"300\\"). With his character of Clyde Shelton, Gerard could have easily made the mistake of going overboard with the anger and aggression. If that had happened then Clyde would have become more of an insulting caricature of a man consumed by his hatred and grief; instead, he remains relatively low-key throughout, thus keeping him relatable. It's a testament to Gerard's acting ability that despite all the carnage his character has wrought, you still sympathize with the man and in a twisted way, root for him. That is a rare feat in movies, and one I'm surprised they achieved here.    On the other side of the mayhem, is actor Jamie Foxx (\\"Collateral\\") as hot-shot prosecutor Nick Rice. Jamie plays Rice with the appropriate blend of arrogance, caring, and determination. Jamie continues to deliver solid performances as an actor, and just like Gerard Butler's character, there are times you may find yourself surprised you're sympathizing with this man. Even though Nick's choices set many of the movie's events into motion, the story gives you ample time to understand his mindset, and as a result you find yourself rooting for him as well.    I found it very strange that this movie was able to make me root for both of the lead characters throughout most of the film; especially with them being on opposing sides. It's not often when I see a movie that would leave me satisfied no matter the outcome, but \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" manages to be one such movie.    Featuring great performances, elaborately staged action set pieces, and a fast-moving, gritty storyline, \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" is a taut and intense thrill ride that will have you riveted from start to finish.    \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" is rated R for violence and language

B0036B8MXC|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW AND HOPE THERE ARE MANY MORE SEASONS. THE ACTING AND STORY LINE WAS GREAT. IT WAS HARD TO WAIT FOR NEW SHOWINGS ON FRIDAYS. I WATCH EACH WEEKS SHOW SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE WEEK. THE CASTING WAS SUPER AND IT WAS A GREAT BALANCE OF LOVE AND HATE. STARZ THINK YOU AND GET YOUR WRITERS BUSY ON FUTURE SHOWS OF SPARTACUS BLOOD AND SAND. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE DVD'S. I WILL MISS THIS SHOW UNTIL IT RETURNS NEXT SEASON.
B003405MF6|5.0|Beautiful melody, wonderful tone, diversity of sound and songs. It was such a joy to purchase this and fill the home with beauty. Includes a caress as well.
193413712X|4.0|I don't think there is so much of a story here...it is not a storybook.  There are some anecdotes that captivate, mostly short and shocking to our sensibilities.    In my view, what this book is about is how little we understand each other.  Four characters come to mind as illustrative: George's dingbat sister talking about herself at his deathbed; Howard's first wife, who's idea of raising children was to nag them into insanity; the grandson talking to George about how is asthma is just like his grandpa's lungs filling up with fluid as his bodily functions shut down and that he knows exactly how his grandpa is feeling; and lastly, Howard's visit to George's house in 1953 on Christmas day as he left the car running at the curb and probably spoke for less than a minute on the front steps in the most shallow of conversations that we all engage in.    I did enjoy the instruction about how to build a beak and then use it to build a proper bird's nest.    I thought a lot of the pages were filled what I call mysticisms, especially describing nature settings and the appearance of things like a head in the stream, etc.  Much of it reminded me of Lord of the Flies.  And I suppose this aspect of the writing is a put off for many people accustomed and expecting a more newspaperly style of narrative.  Did it deserve the Pulitzer Price for Literature:  I am glad it received it.    Lastly, I think the book could be terrifying for some.

B002WIDRM6|4.0|I hope this band uses a different recording engineer on their next album. Some tracks are recorded so far over the limit that the clipping sounds HORRIBLE. Same on their first album. Probably can't hear it on an iPod, but on a good system the quality is simply awful.
B003E48AYC|4.0|In spite of having to read many negative reviews, I was still curious to see this movie. I not a huge Burton fan neither, although I've enjoyed some of his previous work. But it was something about «Alice in Wonderland» which seemed appealing; its visual look and its quirky characters. Still I had in mind the several hostile reviews, which accused this movie to be a flat, soulless and muddled attempt of a classic, which I also feared it would. But after finally seeing the movie, I can claim my disagreement with the reviewers. In fact, I'm not sure if we even saw the same movie. What exactly was so terrible about it?   Overall, I found «Alice in Wonderland» to be very entertaining. I feared that the movie would lose some of it's magic as the main character entered to Wonderland, but fortunately it never did. I enjoyed the movie from the very start to its very end. It's a cute fantasy/adventure movie, equal to the «Harry Potter» and the «Narnia» flicks (although I personally felt «Prince Caspain» had some slight weaknesses). But beware; there are some frightening creatures that may scare the youngest in the audience, so the PG rating is suitable.   One of the films biggest advantages is it visuals. With it lush and dark landscapes, cute animals and colorful costumes, the flick is beautifully to look at and I can't wait to enjoy the sharpness of the picture on Blu Ray. The score of Danny Elfman is effective and gives the movie a dreamy, atmospheric tone. The characters are mostly passable. They don't steal the show entirely, but neither do they appear as distractive or annoying.   Although I've always liked the original novel of Lewis Carroll, I must say that I found this new twist of the story fresh and creative, depicting the «wrong» Alice's adventures in Wonderland as a young adult. Linda Woolverton, who's behind the excellent screenplays for «Beauty and the Beast», «The Lion King» and «Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey», has written a solid and decent script to «Wonderland». Many have claimed this screenplay to be muddled and confusing, but I didn't felt it that way at all. Once again, did we even saw the same movie?   Mia Wasikowska is quite decent as Alice. Although she doesn't have a distinctive emanation/charisma who characterizes other young actresses at her age, she's still delivers a nice and acceptable performance. Personally I felt her screen presence expanded during the movie. Johnny Depp is indeed a good actor. To claim anything else, would be a like claiming that the climate isn't humid in the rain forest. Although I've never been crazy over Depp's work, he's goofy and great as The Mad Hatter, which is indeed the best character in the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is also believable and funny as the Red Queen (just prepare yourself to hear «Off with his head» at least a hundred times during the movie, ha ha). While Anne Hathaway, on the other hand, is warm and passable as the White Queen (although I must confess it was a little distracting to see her with a blonde wig and with a British accent).   In fact, I can't see anything wrong with this new Burton version of «Wonderland». I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone as possible. It didn't deserve the negative criticism at all, in my opinion. With quality films like this, perhaps I could finally forgive Disney for its recent mistakes? (*Cough, leaving hand drawn animation behind and promoting teen stars as crazy, cough*)   So follow every white rabbit you see and follow him to the hole... Wonderland is waiting...  BONUS FEATURES  Unsurprisingly, most of the bonus features lies on the Blu ray disc. However, the amount of the bonus features are disappointingly skimpy. The featurettes are divided in two sections. First are the Wonderland Characters and Making of Wonderland.  First up in the Wonderland Characters-section is \\"Finding Alice\\", which is about the casting of main lead. During a short brief or times, there are interviews with Mia Wazikovska, Tim Burton, Helena Bonham-Carter and Anne Hathaway. They bring up Burton's vision that differs from the Novel, the character arc of the protagonist and some of the clothing designs. Wazikovska herself comes off as a humble, mature and reflective young woman.  Next on the list is \\"The Mad Hatter\\", which is about Depp's insights on his character. Depp manages to give a brief, but interesting research about real hatters, while he talks about his own sketches and visions for the Mad Hatter, comparing to Burton's sketches for the character. And of course the costume and stylizing of the character.   \\"The Futterwacken Dance\\" explains the origins of the fictional Futterwacken dance which Depp's character dances in the movie. The dance was based on an internal joke between the director and Depp. Without spoiling too much, there are interviews with several guys who were in charge of the \\"Futterwacken\\".  Next is \\"The Red Queen\\", which centers about the origins of the Red Queen. Interviews with Bonham-Carter and technical members of the crew, they discuss the design and the costuming of the character, as well as Helena's own thoughts of her own performance.  \\"Time-Lapse: Sculpting The Red Queen\\" is a short video demonstrating the transformation and sculpting of Helena as the Red Queen, while Helena and other make-up artists narrates during the video.  Next is \\"The White Queen\\", which is about the creation of The White Queen.  Hathaway explains her own, early visions for the character, as well the costuming and the other crew members' thoughts of the character.  The first featurette in the Making Wonderland section is Scoring Wonderland. An interesting featurette about the scoring of the film. During an interview with composer Danny Elfman, we'll receive his thoughts about his collaboration with Burton, as well as his process about the film scoring and especially making the \\"Alice\\" anthem.  Quite interesting and informative.  Effecting Wonderland is an interesting featurette about the CGI aspect of the film, the creation of the fully CGI characters in the film and how to exaggerate the looks of the human characters with CGI.  Stunts in Wonderland is a brief featurette about the stunt process of Mia Wazikowska.  Making the Proper Size is about the process of giving the character of Alice the proper size. Interviews with Waizkowska and other crew members reveals the process of making Wazikowska look to small or too big in the various scenes in the film.  Cakes of Wonderland interviews a baker which made all the cakes in the final film, especially the Eat Me cakes. She talks about the ingredients which she used in the film to make the cakes.   Tea Party Props centers about the making of the Iconic Tea Party table and all of its props.   So there you have it; Tim Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland. While it's not one of the most memorable movies of its genre, it is still a solid and good movie that has gotten way more underrated than it deserves. The quality of the picture is superb and so is the sound. While most of the featurettes are interesting and enjoyable, there could still have been of more of them. However, this edition is still recommendable for every fan of this movie.
B0000636NQ|4.0|Long after Ten Years After had run their course, Alvin Lee admitted that his happiest days in the quartet were when they played small clubs (such as London's Marquee, where this live set was recorded) or modest venues (such as Bill Graham's legendary Fillmores). It's not hard to understand why: the biggest break of their career (their incendiary appearance at the Woodstock festival and the film segment which turned them into superstars a year after the festival) may have turned out to be the biggest millstone around their neck, launching them toward the kind of large arenas that were a death sentence to many bands and an on-spot execution for a band whose forte wasn't exactly a motherlode of expansive musical or stage experimentation in the first place.    At the outset, Ten Years After was a welding of blues and jazz, the latter mostly hybridded between pure swing and hard bop (keyboardsman Chick Churchill was nothing if not a Jimmy Smith disciple, and leader Alvin Lee grew up listening as much to Django Reinhardt, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman as he did Big Bill Broonzy, his first pure blues influence), and as pyrotechnically proficient as he was pre-Woodstock Lee wasn't the entire show. If \\"Undead,\\" their second and best album, does little else it should prove that all four musicians had above-average musical presence: Leo Lyons's strikingly fluid bass lines, drummer Ric Lee's smooth syncopations and tireless swing, underappreciated keyboardsman Churchill betraying no few influences from Smith and Wynton Kelly, and butterfingered Alvin showing as many traces of Wes Montgomery and Barney Kessell as Broonzy and T-Bone Walker.     In fact, they could have issued side one of the original vinyl by itself and nailed a classic. Pairing a Count Basie/Jimmy Rushing chestnut (\\"I May Be Wrong, But I Won't Be Wrong Always,\\" readapted from \\"Sent For You Yesterday\\" with the original composing credit handed erroneously to Alvin Lee, who made a point of introducing it as a Basie number on stage) with Woody Herman's longtime calling card (\\"Woodchopper's Ball\\"), Ten Years After shifts seamlessly from steady rolling blues as Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers might imagine it in the rhythm section, with Lee's clean guitar phrasing and Churchill's jabbing organ, to 78 rpm swing whose sleeper element just might be Lyons's skipping bass solo toward the amphetamine-fast finale, prior to which Lee peels off a series of whipsaw-staccato lines and Churchill rolls a rushing but oddly melodious organ solo.    \\"Spider in My Web,\\" which led side two of the original vinyl release, is a pretty routine blues ballad with ho-hum lyrics (not that lyrics were ever a Ten Years After's strength) but tasteful instrument work on all four sides (Lyons especially is effective here). \\"Summertime/Shantung Cabbage\\" a kind of obligatory excuse for a drum solo (by the time they played this date Cream's Ginger Baker had made drum solos de rigeur and, for better or worse, inspired only too many less imaginative percussionists to feature with them) that isn't bad but isn't revelatory, either, unless you want to credit Ric Lee with the mischieviousness needed to display one result might be if someone thought anything to do with Gershwin should be married to a drum exercise. And the original \\"I'm Going Home\\" isn't even close to the lightspeed rock and roll tributary it would become by the time of Woodstock---here, it's just an elemental blues swinging toddler who only hints at the machine-gunning adolescent that would turn Ten Years After from hard-working, jazzy bluesmen into reluctant and, ultimately, ill-fated rock superstars.    If you want to hear Ten Years After right on the threshold of the Woodstock film breaking them big, and thus not yet crippled by the smothering impact of the large venues and comfort-zone playing they engaged to survive them, in a concert setting that wouldn't betray them, make way for \\"Ten Years After Live at Fillmore East 1970.\\" (It's where you'll hear a far fuller and more playful take on \\"I Can't Keep From Crying, Sometimes,\\" the Blues Project staple that became one of their most familiar concert jams, than what's added here.) It's as matured a Ten Years After as you're liable to hear without the pretenses of superstardom grinding away what made their reputation in the first place. But if you want to hear them at an absolute creative peak (adding \\"Rock Your Mama\\" and \\"Spoonful\\" neither helps nor harms the set, even if the former isn't a particularly clever B.B. King rewrite and Cream had the first and final word on reimagining the latter), \\"Undead\\"---and especially the first two selections---is the place to go. Both sets should stand as their truest musical legacy; both sets will stand as a kind of sad suggestion of what could have been for them. If there's truth in the idea that superstardom does as much harm as good to what makes the star in the first place, Ten Years After was one of the Woodstock Generation's signature examples.
B0015DROBO|1.0|Reviews and jacket notes were very deceptive. I expected an engrossing, exciting, intelligent mystery novel. Instead I got an uber-boring,  long-winded story about European magazine publishing and corporate manipulation, intertwined with a storyline about an incestuous family of sexual perverts and murderers. If you like reading about incest and perverts, and the minutiae of European corporate banking, you'll like this book. Otherwise, skip it. There are millions of better books to read.
1416550550|5.0|So many of the previous reviewers stated the story was confusing; keeping the characters straight. Wrong! It is a wonderful, multi-generational story with a good mystery thrown in. A good book. One that keeps you hooked.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout DVD!!! I love that it has 3 different workouts and that it is so effective in 20 minutes.    I for sure recommend this DVD! These workouts are pretty high impact. There are a lot of lunges and things that could be hard on your knees.  If you have knee problems you will just need to be careful.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I took my parents to see this movie a few months before they both passed.  This is an amazing heartfelt movie and will continue to remind me of the wonderful time we spent together.  It was my fathers first 3D film!  He loved it!  The warmth and humor that fills this film will captivate anyone.  Definitely a HIGH recommendation.  And the blu-ray version looks AMAZING at home as well!
0143116177|4.0|The evolution of credit and debt is important.  Banks were the basis of the Italian Renaissance.  (The Medici were foreign exchange dealers.)  The Dutch Republic had the first modern stock market.  The first hedge fund was started in the 1940's.  The financial sector has become a magnet for talent.  In 2008 there was a spasm in the credit system precipitated by defaults in the sub-prime mortgage market.  Central bankers sought to alleviate pressure on banks.  By September 2008 there was a full-blown downturn, a crisis in the markets united through globalization.      The Crusades were partly driven by monetary shortages in Europe.  It was happenstance that gold, silver, and bronze were equated with money.  Money was really about credit, not metal.  Money's true nature is intangible, it is a mere token of exchange.  Early writings are the first business records.  Leonardo of Pisa, Fibonacci, studied Indian and Arabic mathematics.  He published THE BOOK OF CALCULATION in 1202.  The Dutch banks innovated with checks, the Swedish with lending, and the British with the establishment of a joint stock company and the issuance of banknotes.  The core competency of the Rothschilds was the bond market.  Walter Bagehot of THE ECONOMIST formulated the central bank's role, (after three mid nineteenth century crise), as the lender of last resort in order to combat liquidity problems.      In the United States the Federal Reserve System wasn't created until 1913.  Banking in the U.S. was fragmented.  Maine legalized interstate baking in 1976.  A lack of hard cash impeded the Confederate effort in the Civil War.  The South was viewed as a credit risk.  The rentiers were done in by World War I.  There was postwar hyperinflation, a kind of state bankruptcy.  Germany was plunged into hyperinflation.  There was no access to the international bond market.  There was a malfunction of the political economy.  Currency and economy collapsed alike.      Stock markets mirror human psyche.  Bubbles are produced by asymmetric information, cross-border capital flows, and easy credit.  John Law thought a monopoly trading company and a public bank that issued notes would be a good thing.  France gave Law a chance to try out his plan.  The Banque Generale was established.  The monarch was supposed to delegate his credit to a trading company.  Hence, the Company of the West was conceived, subsequently to be known as the Mississippi Company.  Unfortunately monetary expansion fueled an asset bubble.  When the scene shifted from euphoria to mania, a few people saw the system would implode.  John Law was appointed Controller General.      Asset price deflation in 1929 did not cause the Great Depression.  Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz claimed the Federal Reserve System bore primary responsibility for the crash.  Keynes observed that in a crisis markets could be irrational longer than investors could be solvent.  It is possible that financial history is a matter of institutional mutation and natural selection.      The book is quite good.  The beginning is more interesting than the later chapters.  Index, Notes, and an Afterward are supplied.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|I liked this movie. It's man's triumph over evil,man's willingness to survive with help from a few friends.
1400052173|5.0|This book is a remarkable account of the story of Henrietta Lacks, the original \\"donor\\" of the HeLa cell line.  As such it combines biography with medical and scientific journalism at a level which can serve as a model of how this can and should best be accomplished.    The author accomplishes some remarkable tasks in the course of developing this book. She relies on primary sources, and that undertaking clearly required effort, tact, consideration for the wishes and concerns of the family members, and genuine commitment to their future in establishing a scholarship fund on behalf of descendants.  (Something to which the medical and scientific community that has benefitted so greatly from Henrietta Lack's life might seek to contribute.)     The author also presents the family's view of events and their view of the medical system in a way that it beautifully illuminates the chasm one must grapple with in medicine when patients from one cultural heritage must interface with health care providers from another culture.  This alone would make this book good required reading for medical students.    The research and reporting of the scientific and medical decision making required coming to grips with complex material, which is then translated accurately and fairly for a general audience.  She is able, in the course of describing the impact of the cell line to raise many as yet unresolved major medical ethical issues- informed consent, \\"tissue ownership\\", confidentiality.  These issues are explored fairly within the historical context at the time as well as within the evolving legal context of the present.    The thought, effort, and creativity that went into this book is truly impresive.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|In l964 I was 14 yrs old. I'va wanted to listen to my old music again, now that the Beatles music has been re-released I am a very happy camper.
B0037W68F4|4.0|MGMT have created a finely crafted piece of musical poetry - psychedelic imaginings of course, soul, developed appreciation of reverb drenched heroes such as Spiritualized and the Flaming Lips, Supergrass' more tripping moments, and deliver an album that (perhaps) brings their honest musings to the table. It rocks, it shudders, it inspires.<br /><br />The group also have some of their strange melodic moments, such as the first few minutes of Siberian Breaks, that might put off the Oracular Spectacular fans who expect the more \\"digestible\\" melodies of \\"Kids\\" and \\"Electric Feel\\" - but after repeated attention, the songs offer many returns lyrically and melodically. Even Siberian Breaks reveals ear candy after the first half of the song.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this album, it's a great second effort and I'm hungry for more.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|I liked this movie, though I felt the story didn't stray much from the original or even the Disney cartoon that came out a few years ago. The action scenes were good and the visuals nice, though paying extra for the 3D was a waste. I felt like I ordered a pepperoni pizza and only got 4 slices of peperoni on it. Where were all the great 3D effects? There were only a handful of them.<br /><br />The acting was good at times and completely absent at other points, especially from Zeus & Hades. It was just brand name actors in wardrobe adding nothing to the movie. The scenes where they go into Medusa's lair in order to defeat her were the best ones of the film I thought. The ending was pretty anti-climactic. I mean after Medusa is defeated, the battle with the Cracken and Hades took all of about 4 minutes! Still the movie was enjoyable, and this IS a good theatre movie. I would have gave it 4 stars, but frankly I was disappointed in the 3D experience and I thought they could have done a little something more original with the storyline.<br /><br />Final Grade: B-
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|It's not often you stumble across a band that wins your heart within the first few chords. I was looking for a different band, and stumbled across Mumford & Sons instead. I heard The Cave and I loved it before the song had even made it to the minute mark. Then the banjo starts just after a minute and I knew I was going to like this band very, very much.     Mumford & Sons are something to talk about, in my opinion. It's not often you get a bluegrass country folky sort of band that actually makes it to mainstream radio. And they are successful for good reason! They write unforgettable melodies that beg you to hit repeat and infuse a whole bunch of styles to create something amazing. I find it a very likeable cross between Kings of Leon and The Fray, but with a banjo.     Track by Track:    Sigh No More - I must admit, this is a skip-able track for me. It's good, but by no means the best on the album. It's a good intro track and slowly lets you get into the mood. It introduces you to the style that will follow throughout most of the album, that is slowly building until it explodes at the end. But I think the reason it is skip-able is because I'm rushing to get to the next... 4/5    The Cave - This is simply an amazing song. Love at first listen, for sure. It starts off with Marcus's gravelly voice before building up to the banjo and then settling down again. The melody is infectious, as is the lyrics. I can guarantee you'll be singing along to the chorus at the top of your lungs in no time. 5/5    Winter Winds - The second single off the album that for some reason didn't do nearly as well as Little Lion Man, but in my opinion, just as good. It flows along like a river and is a hard one to skip. 5/5    Roll Away Your Stone - This one is particularly folky. It's one of the more upbeat, bluegrass infused songs and is sure to get your foot tapping. It's a great track, though not one my favourites. There are better melodies on the album than this and I find it a little disjointed. 4.5/5    White Blank Page - Definitely a standout track! This song is so achingly beautiful. Marcus's voice is simply stunning in it, you can actually feel the despair in his voice. It picks up just after the minute mark and the song soars into a powerful ballad with a whole lot of angst. 5/5    I Gave You All - A beautiful song. It is another that follows their style and builds from a quiet, soft ballad into powerful, angst-ridden track. 5/5    Little Lion Man - The first single! It was highly successful for very good reason. It is simply an amazing song. This is the one where the Kings of Leon comparisons come in... but with banjo. The banjo is definitely a highlight in this and as soon as it started, I was won. Also another chorus singalong track, extremely catchy! 5/5    Timshel - The harmonies at the beginning of this track draw you in and never really let go. It's one of the slowest on the album, and very beautiful. 4.5/5    Thistle & Weeds - This track is a little different, a little darker than the rest. It also has more of an appearance of piano in it, which works really well. It's a great track, but not my favourite. It lacks the melody of the others, in my opinion. 4/5    Awake My Soul - It's about this point in the album where I start to realise I'm liking almost every song. This is another catchy, beautiful track. Great intrumentalisation. 4.5/5    Dust Bowl Dance - This is quite likely the best written track on the album. The start is incredible. The banjo riff is so soft and melodious it makes your spine tingle. After this, it changes direction quite a bit and simply explodes into a wild, violent and angry piece. It is the best story-telling song of the whole album. The only problem is, I like the beginning much more the end and they're so different it feels like two different songs sometimes. I've got into this habit of flicking back to the start halfway through just to hear the banjo riff again... 5/5    After The Storm - A slow, beautiful,melodious track. It's one to listen to late at night, in the dark with your headphones on. Just close your eyes and listen. It is one the standout tracks, for sure. Amazing. It has some of my favourite lyrics on the album: \\"There will come a time you'll see/With no more tears and love will not break your heart/But dismiss your fears.\\" 5/5    This is one of those albums that is going to get a lot of spins in my player, and will be a feature in my car for years to come I expect! Get it. It's awesome. =)    Standout Tracks:  The Cave  Winter Winds  White Blank Page  Little Lion Man  Dust Bowl Dance  After The Storm
B0025KVLRY|4.0|\\"With the Beatles\\" is the second studio album from The Beatles. With 8 of the 14 songs written by the band, this is a mixture of 1950's style songs and songs that are reminiscent of the harmonizing girl groups that proceeded them. The George Harrison song, \\"Don't Bother Me\\" is enjoyable but not memorable. George would not write another song for two years after this. The songs \\"Little Child\\", \\"Hold Me Tight\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" are likable but a little immature in retrospect. \\"Not a Second Time\\" is one of the few bad songs they every did.    The remaining songs written by The Beatles from this album have the catchy youthful adolescent bounce and optimism which everyone loved so much. These upbeat songs really rang a bell with a grieving American public considering they were released in the months following the assassination of President Kennedy. Lastly, the song \\"Money\\" is one of the best cover songs The Beatles ever performed or recorded.     Even after all these years, the matching suits, the mop haircuts and the groundbreaking concept of naming four guys one thing has lost much of it's meaning. But the hook of The Beatles remains the same. Their music is bright and youthful but sung in sad minor keys. Their sad off-key vocalizing only adds to this. Optimistic yet sad and bright yet melancholy is forever the hook of the early music from The Beatles.    \\"With the Beatles\\" is recommended.
0385523904|5.0|The book reviews sounded interesting, so I searched out this title through the local library.  Interesting from the very beginning.  It educated me on life in another part of the world, with which I had no previous knowledge.
B003E48AYC|4.0|For starters, it seems that everyone I know is shocked when I tell them that this Alice in Wonderland is a sequel of sorts. At the age of 19 and about to be forced into marriage, this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland. I'm glad Tim Burton and his team came up with a new story that still featured all the great characters from the original source material. That's also where the weakest part of the movie lies. The dialogue given to the characters is great, but the script is razor thin. I think if more effort went into this particular aspect, I might have given it five stars.<br /><br />I saw it in IMAX 3-D and the visuals are as grand and beautiful as you would expect from Burton. It's not quite as eye-popping as Avatar, which was shot completely in IMAX 3-D, whereas, Alice in Wonderland was upconverted (Clash of the Titans did the same thing to bad effect). The music by Danny Elfman is some of his best stuff in recent years and the costumes/makeup are top notch.<br /><br />Aside from the look of film, the acting also makes it very memorable. There are so many well animated and voice acted characters running around I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with those made of flesh and blood. I didn't like Depp's take on Willy Wonka that much, and I'm a big fan of his, but his Mad Hatter is just the right amount of crazy. His voice goes back and forth from having a lisp to sounding like William Wallace from Braveheart. His look is so jarring, you probably wouldn't even know it was him if you somehow dodged all the advertisements before entering the theater. Helena Bonham Carter played the Red Queen brilliantly. I couldn't take my eyes off her giant head. Anne Hathaway really surprised me here (in a good way) with her take on the White Queen and it was nice to see Crispin Glover back on the big screen in a role that suited him. Last, but certainly not least, Mia Wasikowska was absolutely captivating as Alice. The way she talked and her reactions were just what the film needed in it's central role. All the digital animal characters were great, but my favorites were the Cheshire Cat, voice by Stephen Fry, and the March Hare voiced by Paul Whitehouse.<br /><br />I'm somewhat surprised that the combination of violence and meanness, along with the smoking Blue Caterpillar didn't get this a PG-13 rating. It's not too harsh, but young kids might get a little freaked out.<br /><br />Overall, Alice in Wonderland looks like a polished jewel, has great acting/voice acting, wonderful music and even manages to get quite a few laughs in the process. If only the simple story didn't let me down in the end, this could have been a classic in the making.

B0002BO05S|3.0|Even though I'm not in the slightest bit religious myself, I'm fascinated by the subject and always have been.  Perhaps, actually, it's because I don't get the whole need for faith in so many peoples' lives, and I'd like to understand a bit more of it.  Or perhaps it's nostalgia for my own childhood, when the Biblical epics were a big part of every Easter.  I didn't really understand what the holiday meant, but I did know that we'd get to see Moses parting the Red Sea and Ben-Hur racing in a chariot, and in those pre-STAR WARS, pre-video and cable days, that was something.  Along with Easter eggs, the movies were the big thing.<br /><br />I never as a kid saw George Stevens' late entry into the 50s-60s Biblical craze, 1965's THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD.  At least I have no memory of it, and one would think that Max von Sydow's light mellifluous accent and piercing blue eyes at least would have left some imprint on my memory.  But it's not a film that did particularly well at the time of its' release, being fraught with production difficulties and savaged by a large chunk of the critics at the time, and it seems not to have aged well.  John Huston's THE BIBLE is probably its only peer in the list of most-forgotten Biblical epics of the era.  It does get mentioned for it's laughable use of a great many of Hollywood's biggest stars in tiny, tiny roles - a tendency common to many megabudget productions of the time, and not just ones set in ancient Judea.  Sidney Poitier has a brief wordless bit as Simon of Cyrene; Shelley Winters gets healed; so does Sal Mineo; and most (in)famously, John Wayne is a centurion who witnesses the crucifixion and offers the memorable line \\"Truly, this man was the son of God.\\"  Window dressing, most of them, and generally not very good window dressing.  And the film, even in the truncated 196-minute cut that's on video now (it was originally 260 minutes on first release) feels sluggish and connect-the-dots in its storytelling, moving from one scene to the next in a sort of greatest hits fashion but never really establishing a FEELING for this man who would be acclaimed \\"Son of God\\"; and because the filmmakers chose not to show most of the miracles in any kind of explicit way, this Jesus comes across mostly as a mild teacher of obvious homilies until he does manage to show some fire in the last quarter or so of the film.<br /><br />But it's not all bad news.  von Sydow does his best I think with a rather poor conception of the savior that isn't at all his fault, and some of the rest of the cast come off pretty well.  Charlton Heston is a muscular and vital and charismatic John the Baptist, if not a terribly spiritual-seeming one; and Jos&eacute; Ferrer is smooth, scheming but quite magnetic Herod Antipas.  The landscape photography is exquisite; nope, it wasn't filmed in the Holy Land unlike most such films, instead being shot in the American southwest including Death Valley and Canyonlands, because Stevens wanted a more \\"impressive\\" Judea.  I guess that gives you an idea of the methodology at work on the film in most areas - big locations, big sets (the Jerusalem stuff is all on stages, and they ARE nice to look at, if a bit too spanking-new to properly represent a city that was thousands of years old even then), big music by Alfred Newman that frequently recalls large-scale works by English masters like Vaughan Williams and Elgar.  There are some scenes that really worked for me - I quite liked the raising of Lazarus, though again it is not seen clearly, presumably because Stevens (who coproduced and cowrote the film in addition to directing; it was very much a personal project for him) wanted to accentuate the \\"faith\\" aspect - belief in miracles and God being more important than actually witnessing them.  The merging of Newman's score into Handel's Hallelujah chorus is done quite well and it's a powerful way to end Part I just before the intermission.<br /><br />Others have commented on the \\"inaccuracy\\" of the film - shuffling of events and such.  As I said above, I'm not religious and only have a basic knowledge of the Gospels, so I'm viewing it purely in terms of narrative, storytelling, cinematic qualities.  And on those grounds, if you want a conventional story of Jesus' life, you are I think better off with Zeffirelli's JESUS OF NAZARETH than any of the other contenders; if you want more interesting \\"cinematic\\" examples there are the rather opposed visions of Martin Scorsese (THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST) and Mel Gibson (THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST), and the ascetic, very low-budget black and white THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW from Pier Paolo Pasolini.  Though I'm not crazy about Gibson's film, it and the others are all more fascinating and dynamic films than Stevens' production, for my money.<br /><br />Ultimately THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD rings rather ordinary, for such an important story.  The money is all on display, the massive cast and sets and spectacular scenery, and von Sydow tries his darndest, but it seems at heart a film more for those who know the story and just want to see an enactment of it in 70mm splendor, but who don't need or care to have any explanation as to what it is really all about.  If you want a Jesus who just IS, this might suit you; if you want to really understand the importance of the story and the life and death, I'm not sure you'll get it here.

B002ZG9846|4.0|What a wacky movie this is. When I first saw the previews, I thought this Kick-Ass was going to be aimed at kids and teens. Boy was I way off, because it earns it's R rating many times over. I really had no intention of seeing this film until I saw the very positive reviews flowing in from the critics. Not that I always agree with them, but in this case I would like to thank them for getting my butt down to the local theater today.<br /><br />Parts of the movie reminded me of Watchmen. You have everyday people who are sick of bad things happening to good people, decide to put on costumes, have funny hero names, and then beat and cut apart the bad guys in a not so nice way. I actually thought it was rather tame in the gore department, compared to what I read about beforehand, but the violence and language is way too strong for kids.<br /><br />The acting is good from everyone. I liked newcomer Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass himself. Nicolas Cage turns in one of his better performaces in a long time, though I think he was great in an over-the-top kind of way in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is still doing his McLovin thing in every movie since Superbad, but it worked again. Mark Strong is kind of one note as the villain, like in Sherlock Holmes, but I think he's a little better in this role. The real star of the show is little 11-year-old, Chloe Moretz, as Hit-Girl. She is clearly the most memorable thing in a movie with a bunch of stuff worth remembering. As the daughter of Cage's Big Daddy hero, she spews out bad language, slices and shoots baddies by the dozens, and loves her daddy. I want one of my own.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is serious in tone most of the time, but there are some killer comedy bits and lines that had the whole theater erupting with laughter. The music is well placed in key scenes and the director/writer, Matthew Vaughn, did a fine job in creating a comic book film that should please both fans and non-fans of the genre alike.<br /><br />Even though it looks like Kick-Ass will come in #1 this weekend, it still feels more like a cult film to me. I can easily see this movie being talked about decades from now, much like Army of Darkness, but without the campiness factor. What a breath of fresh air in a genre that has just as many misses as it does hits.though it looks like Kick-Ass will come in #1 this weekend, it still feels more like a cult film to me.

B002GY9F9K|4.0|My wife and I encountered this show about half-way through season one. She enjoyed it quite a bit, so I bought her the DVD set and the book \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" so that she could catch up on the story.    We have enjoyed the DVDs, but now every major event in the show is accompanied by my wife saying, \\"That's not how it happened!\\"    Your milage may vary.
B0000029DD|4.0|I had the great fortune of being hip to Jeff Buckley in the early 90's before Grace was released.  I had a promo CD of various live performances Jeff did while in New York.  The thing that astonished me was his voice.  I never heard a male voice that carried so much weight and at times was as light as a feather.  His musicianship was nothing to sneeze at either.  After listening to the promo I wondered if he would ever be signed to a major label or just be a cult musician like Scott Walker and a few others.  A few years passed and I was in Los Angeles driving up the coast to San Francisco when I heard a chime of guitars and a throbbing bass and a familiar voice.  It was Buckley and the song was the \\" Last Goodbye \\".  I must admit that when I got to Frisco I found a record store and purchased Grace.  I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, that was the only CD I played during my travels around California.  From the mountains to the desert to seaside resorts the music was hypnotic and poignant.  I wanted to know more about Buckley but the few interviews he gave, I found him to be cryptic and even a touch melancholic.  I also felt a deep sense that he wasn't going to be around long either.  But, with that being said, let me just say the songs \\" Last Goodbye, Lilac Wine, So Real, Lover Should Have Come Over and a the remake of Leonard Cohen's Halleljah\\" are the best songs on this album.  It's a damn shame that Jeff is no longer with us. He left behind quite an impression in the music world that will be greatly missed.  He was a geniune singer/songwriter/musician.  There will never be another American male artist of his caliber again.  This crap on the radio nowadays is absolutely horrible.  If you've never heard of Jeff Buckley please get a copy of his debut album and also the album he was working on when he died called Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. There is nothing more I can say about this man without getting depressed myself.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|Informative, a bit one-sided, but pretty good.  Rich get richer...works if you're rich. :)    I learned many things which I didn't know, like companies profiting from life insurance policies on their employees. Dr. Salk giving away the polio vaccine, derivatives, get senior citizens out of their homes, etc.    A bit socialistic, but informative none the less. \\"Welfare, union, WE??\\" (from the Constitution)    I liked STEVEN Moore's, columnist of WSJ, comment about capitalism > democracy. US constitution DOESN'T GUARANTEE happiness!    There are people offering alternatives.    So, if we try hard enough we'll make it right?
B002ZFQD04|3.0|Madonna's great.  There's no one like her or will ever be like her.  Unfortunately, I have a feeling that she had nothing to do with the editing of this hot mess of a DVD.  I get it!  You were trying to convey that this was an energized show, that it was high energy - high impact - blah blah blah.  But cutting from one camera to the next ever 1.8 seconds makes this DVD look like it was edited by a high school's AV class.  I can't possibly imagine that anyone with an ounce of experience edited this hot mess.  Both the sound and the picture quality are abominable!  But the poor editing takes the cake on this one.  If it wasn't Madonna, you couldn't pay me to watch this editing mess.

B000002WMH|5.0|I have been doing a series of commentaries elsewhere on another site on my coming of political age in the early 1960s, but now when I am writing about musical influences I am just speaking of my coming of age, period,  which was not necessarily the same thing. No question those of us who came of age biologically in the1950s are truly children of rock and roll. We were there, whether we appreciated it or not at the time, when the first, sputtering, moves away from ballady show tunes, rhymey Tin Pan Alley tunes and, most importantly, any and all music that your parents might have approved of, even liked, or at least left you alone to play in peace up in your room hit post World War II America like, well, like an atomic bomb.     Well, as most of us know anyway the subject of this review, Elvis, is gone now. But it is hard to go back to the roots of rock and roll without paying much lip service to his musical influence, his showmanship, his energy when performance time came and he was in the mood to kick up some dust, and his sneerily-etched good looks. I will tell you that Jerry Lee Lewis was most of an influence on my early music tastes than Elvis. I also believe pound for pound that Jerry Lee had more energy on any given day than Elvis could release in his early career. But on the proverbial any given day, and this day and this massive CD compilation serve as one of them, the king was the King.    Later Elvis, the Elvis of Las Vegas, except for severe aficionados, was almost entirely forgettable but in the early to mid-1950s, and maybe a little later, when he was still hungry and still wanted to fight to be king of rock he more than held his own. That is the time of this compilation and the Elvis time any serious rock aficionado, or historically-inclined rock fan wants to look at. This five CD set provides all the ammunition you will ever need for the why behind why he drove the girls wild in the 1950s, and the rest of us, just ordinary teen guys, crazy trying how to figure out to break his spell. It's wasn't pretty because no way we could win.    But enough of that. Elvis sneers, swivel hips and those long side-burns aside what in this compilation goes down in rock history. Please note that some of these songs that are outstanding example of his early work are done in several versions here, some very well done others less so. \\"That's Where The Heartbreak Begins\\" has a nice talking part. \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", of course, although the lyrics are hardly the stuff of teen romance. The Carl Perkins rockabilly classic, \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\", which Elvis made his own. Other rockabilly classics like \\"That `s All Right\\" and \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\". Some covers like Roy Oberson's \\"I Got A Woman\\". \\"Big Mama\\" Thornton's \\"Hound Dog\\". Ballads like \\"Love Me Tender\\" and \\"True Love\\". And so on. If you want Elvis, good bad, or indifferent this is a primer, no, a graduate course in Elvisology.    Note: I have not mentioned \\"One Night\\" above because I want to pay special to that song. On every variation in this set he smokes it. This song, more so that \\"Jailhouse Rock', \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" or \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" gets my nod as the epitome of Elvis rock, sneer, and swivel. This is one time that he is not mailing it in. Now I know, finally, why those young girls of my generation were swooning, getting all sweaty and more over the mere mention of Elvis' name.  On this one Jerry Lee takes a back seat, way back. Wow!

While most of these poets and their works have faded into obscurity, I can only imagine that each of these poets would be delighted to see this renaissance of his or her work, with Natalie's additional dimension of musical magic.  This beautiful ouevre will become a masterpiece for generations to come.

B000000H6Y|5.0|Type O Negative were definitely an iconic band to emerge out of the 90's metal scene, and \\"Bloody Kisses\\" is the album that helped define their sound. For the most part, the band took a new approach with this album, embodying a Gothic style throughout the vast majority of it. Whether it would be the iconic tracks such as \\"Christian Woman\\" and especially \\"Black No. 1\\", every track is strong. However, what made Type O Negative their own unique band was that they didn't take everything seriously, and it shows. For example, \\"Black No. 1\\" managed to poke fun at Gothic dress stereotypes. Also, the vocals of the recently departed Peter Steele are completely unique, using a deep, melancholic voice with a great dynamic range.<br /><br />As classic as this may be, I would encourage to try to get your hands on the original jewel case release, as the digipak omits \\"Kill All the White People\\" and \\"We Hate Everyone\\", despite how stylistically different they are compared to the rest of the album. However, if the hardcore punk styles aren't your cup of tea, the digipak release features \\"Suspended in Dusk\\". Whatever version you do get, you won't be disappointed, as this is the sound of a band that wasn't afraid to be their own.<br /><br />R.I.P. Peter Steele 1962-2010
B0000CDL93|5.0|The double DVD set of the movie JFK was excellent - there were some scenes in the main DVD I hadn't seen in previous video cuts of the film, and the 2nd DVD showing extended and deleted scenes of the movie as well as other related topics were very informative and interesting for anyone that has had a keen historical interest in the JFK assassination as I have throughout the years.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|This is Natalie's absolute masterpiece.  Even though these are poems written by others which are set to music crafted by Natalie, Natalie makes each one of these songs completely hers.  The album in general has a very melancholy feel to it, especially in the songs \\"Nursery Rhyme of Innocence\\", \\"Maggie millie mollie may\\", and \\"The man in the wilderness\\".      This album is beautifully crafted and takes you on a long, winding, amazing journey and brings you back home feeling satisfied.    The album does have many different moments and tempos and not every song may be for everyone, however, that being said, Natalie is in her finest form here.

B000OPPSXK|4.0|Josef Krips proves himself to be a fine Mozartian in this excellent cycle recorded in 1972-73 with the Concertgebouw. IMHO these recordings are as good as Bohm's more famous recordings [[ASIN:B000001GQB Mozart: Symphonien Nos. 35-41]]  and not that far behind those of Walter's mono recordings from the early 1950's and any of those by Szell. There is no romantic interpretation to be found here, just straight-up classic period Mozart. In fact, Krips' pace is quite similar to that of Walter, which is more relaxed than Szell (perhaps the greatest Mozart conductor to date), but still enjoyable. The playing of the wonderful Concertgebouw is also ideal (especially the strings) for Mozart. No matter how many other Mozart symphonies you own, your collection is somewhat lacking without this set. Those purchasing their first Mozart symphonies won't be disappointed with this set, but may be more comfortable with Szell or Bohm.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|For me, watching this \\"movie\\" was like driving over a mountain in the beginning, then driving through Death Valley in the middle, then going over another mountain at the end.      The movie started off great with the footage at the beginning of the process of recording/writing of the record.  Towards the middle, when James goes to rehab, it gets really dry and I almost just turned it off. Towards the end, when they start looking in earnest for a bass player, it starts picking up again and started showing performance footage.  I realize this movie wasn't just a behind the scenes concert movie, but geese.. The middle of the movie could have been done a lot better.      In the end, after I watched the movie and gave it time to digest, I think I figured out what the intent of the whole thing was.  You are reminded in the end with the concert footage that these guys are literal gods of metal. They are, without a doubt, the most successful rock band of all time.  You forget that when watching the middle of the movie with all the problems and issues they confront.  I do agree with another reviewer who stated they acted like a bunch of sniveling teenagers throughout most of the movie.  However, I could not imagine what it is like to be in their shoes (although I wouldn't mind trying)!  If you live like a rock star, you will die like a rock star.  It must be difficult to realize that and come back to reality.    In the end, it was an ok movie.  I'm glad I rented from a video store instead of purchasing it. It probably will not be rented again.  And, I would imagine that most everyone who watches this movie would like to smack the gum out of Lars's mouth. He's quite the character (putting it mildly).
B000Y179KO|5.0|Most of the bad reviews I read for this album are written by people with short attention spans that listened to the album one time and panned it.  Well, if you are expecting the same old thing from the Eagles, you might be disappointed, at first. But, if you listen more than once, you will discover that this could be the best album they have ever created. These songs are more mature, with song structures that show real growth.  The harmonies are exquisite, and the lyrics are as good as anything the group has ever done.  I'll admit that the first time I listened, I wasn't so impressed. Not as many hard rockers. But after repeat listenings, I began to hear the genius behind the songs.  The songs blend in a homogenous whole that is exceptionally rewarding. The Eagles still have plenty to say, and they have created some great music here, to say it with.

B00371QQ2U|4.0|One of the annoyances of Blu-ray is that it takes so long to actually start, and \\"Apollo 13\\" is no exception. It's also, however, not exceptional in this regard, and after reading other reviews I expected world-class problems. That's why I bought it locally -- I wanted to return it easily.    As it happened, that wasn't necessary.    First, the film. Ron Howard is not a flashy director. Like Spielberg, there are very few \\"Look at me; aren't I incredibly brilliant?\\" shots. \\"Apollo 13\\" just tells the story, and let's the story pull you in. It does and you're hooked. It's a great film, and it also shows off what a Blu-ray can do.    I wish I could say as much about the extras, though. They apparently depend far too much on your machine hooking up to the internet. If it doesn't (and mine doesn't) the extras are pretty dreary. The three featurettes are, well, dull. They tell you very little about making the film. I can't speak to the internet extras, but then I'm not really interested in interacting with the film.     Also, as mentioned elsewhere, having to choose the language is ridiculous. This is a Region 1 release. Region 1 is U.S., U.S. territories and Canada. We speak English here (folks in Quebec also speak French, but they learn English, too).    But back to the first point. Wondering if the disk was going to run at all, I decided to time it with a stop watch (again, note my player is NOT web-connected) on my year-old Samsung with no firmware updates since last May. Result: From the time I pushed the \\"open/close\\" button on the remote until the movie actually began (including choice of language and choosing \\"play movie\\" on the menu) took just over three minutes -- to be precise, 3:06.

B00005JLD4|4.0|Rabbit Proof Fence    The movie Rabbit Proof Fence is adapted from the book Follow the Rabbit Proof Fence written by Doris Garimara about the true story of three little girls journey across the plains of Australia. The movie takes place during the 1930's when it was customary in Australia for aboriginal children that were half-castes to be removed from their families and sent to a school to become indentured servants to the whites living in Australia. This was a standard practice during the \\"stolen generation\\" which was from 1869 through 1969 and into the 1970's in some parts of Australia.     The movie depicts the travels of Molly, Gracie, (sisters) and Daisy (a cousin to Molly and Gracie) that were taken away from their town of Jigalong and sent to be reformed at Moore River Native Settlement camp north of Perth Australia. The leader of Moore River, A.O. Neville signs the documents to request to bring the girls to the camp \\"for the better of the aboriginal people.\\" the common belief system of the supporters of the half - castes movement. They believed that through separation and racial mixing, eventually the aboriginal people would be eliminated form the earth.     Once they are separated from their family, they travel by car, train, and in the back of a truck to the camp where they are to live. We first meet Moodoo or \\"tracker\\" an aboriginal man whose own daughter is in the camp and is himself on probation for a crime, when he returns with an escapee from the camp. The punishment we see for this girl is being locked up in a small building about the size of a port a john for days. Molly decides that the punishment is worth the crime and the three girls are going to escape from Moore and attempt the fifteen hundred mile journey back to their home village of Jigalong.    Molly knows the tracker is very good at his skill of following his prey; they must try to cover their tracks at all costs. Throughout the journey they run into people who give them food and shelterand offer support. During one such encounter they are told to stay away from the men along the Rabbit Proof Fence because they are dangerous. Knowing the fence goes through their village, Molly knows this will lead them home. Neville also realizes this would be the way the girls go to get home and establishes checkpoints along the way using Moodoo and other constables to try and catch them. The girls avoid most of the traps, but Gracie falls for a story from a man about catching a train in a near by town. Gracie breaks from the group and goes to the town to catch the train and is then captured by one of the constables.  Molly and Daisy see this happen but can do nothing to stop it or they will be caught and sent back to Moore.     Molly and Daisy make it back to Jigalong after some struggles and hardships. We find out at the end of the movie that Molly's two children were taken away from her and sent to Moore, but Molly traveled the same journey after escaping a second time with one of her daughters. Gracie never made it back to Jigalong.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I am not sure how I actually missed seeing this series in the 90's, but I did. The pilot and the first season are brilliant. The second season is great up until the murder is solved, then it just gets stupid for many reasons that they explain in the bonus commentaries in this DVD set.    Regardless, the first season and the beginning of the 2nd are phenomenal, this became a personal favorite instantly for me.
B000KX0IOA|4.0|Gandhi, the 1982 best movie, best director, and best actor of the year is about the life of Mohandas Gandhi and his quest to bring nonviolent resistance to the country of India. The movie starts with Gandhi buying a first class ticket on a train in South Africa; people from India aren't allowed to travel in the first class section, only in the third class. Gandhi was thrown off the train after he protested about not being able to travel in first class even though he was able to buy a ticket. This is where the simple young lawyer turns to a life of peaceful, nonviolent protests and eventually one of the world's greatest political leaders of all time.   Gandhi returned to India after convincing himself that he needed to become a leader and stand up against and protest the British Rule in India. He led marches, demonstrations, along with protests all of which brought worldwide attention to the plight of violence of India by the British government. He taught his followers to not fight back when fought on because it made the attacks from the British look even more horrid if they were hitting people that were not fighting back. The people of India realized this approach was the proper approach and started living a life of non violence. After many successful years of this approach, the British Empire left India, but by this time a war was breaking out in India, a war between the Muslims and the Hindus.   Gandhi started to fast; he declared he would continue fasting until the fighting stopped. The Muslims and the Hindus realized that fighting was not the answer and stopped their war. The country of Pakistan was formed as the result of the war ending. Gandhi was assassinated on his way to meet with the leaders to discuss the differences in religions. The most non violent man in the free world was removed from the earth in one of the most violent ways possible.

B00005214X|5.0|The late George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, originally released in 1970 shortly after the break-up of the Beatles, is an outstanding album and is probably the best \\"solo\\" album released by any of the former Beatles.  The album was originally a three-LP box set (with opulent and beautifully colored interior packaging) with two LPs of \\"songs\\" and a third \\"bonus\\" LP titled \\"Apple Jam,\\" containing extended jams performed by the all-star lineup of musicians that appear on the album.  All of the music, and more, is included in this reissued set.  The original album also contained a large poster of George, which is not included here.    When he recorded All Things Must Pass, George Harrison was on a creative roll, having contributed \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" the previous year to The Beatles' Abbey Road.  All Things Must Pass (and his headlining of the star-studded benefit Concert For Bangla Desh the following year) marked George Harrison's high water mark as a solo artist, and contains some of his finest songs, including the hit singles \\"My Sweet Lord\\" (according to the judicial system, a reworked cover of The Chiffons' early 60's hit \\"He's So Fine\\") and \\"What Is Life\\" (without your love), the chilling \\"Beware of Darkness,\\" \\"Isn't It A Pity,\\" \\"Apple Scuffs,\\" \\"Wah-Wah,\\" \\"Ballad Of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll),\\" \\"Awaiting On You All,\\" \\"If Not For You\\" (a Dylan cover), \\"I'd Have You Any Time\\" (co-written by Harrison and Dylan) and the title track.  The three original LPs fit nicely onto two CDs with room for some extra songs.  The first CD contains the first LP from the original album plus five additional tracks: \\"I Live For You,\\" an excellent outtake featuring stellar pedal steel playing by the late Pete Drake, an acoustic demo of \\"Beware of Darkness,\\"  alternative versions of \\"Let It Down\\" and \\"What Is Life\\" and a new (circa 2000) version of \\"My Sweet Lord.\\"  The second CD contains the second LP and the bonus \\"Apple Jam\\" LP from the original album.The playing on the album is first-rate.  The album contains a virtual who's who of backing musicians, including: Derek and the Dominos (Eric Clapton, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle and Bobby Whitlock); Ringo Starr, Billy Preston and Klaus Voormann (the Beatles contingent); Gary Brooker (of Procul Harem); Alan White (later to join Yes); Phil Collins (later to join Genesis); Pete Drake; Dave Mason (on leave from Traffic); Badfinger (including Pete Ham); Bobby Keys (Rolling Stones sideman); and others.               This Phil Spector produced album features Spector's famous \\"wall of sound\\" which permeates the album.  As George notes (apologetically) in the liner notes, the sound is a bit dated, but at the time it suited the songs well.  The CD remastering is excellent; this is one case where the CDs may actually sound better than the original LPs.       The packaging of the original version of this CD reissue was really nice.  Originally this set (the version I have) was offered in a mini-box replica of the original album, with a colorized version of the original black and white album cover.  The mini-box contained individual sleeves for each of the two CDs with alterative versions of the colorized cover, and a nice booklet with an essay by George, some cool photos, the lyrics and information on the artists appearing on the album.  The set is now offered as a digipak; I am not familiar with the newer packaging.  (Apparently, Amazon offers both the mini-box and digipak versions of this release.  If you purchase this set, I'd recommend picking up the boxed edition if it is available).                In short, this is a must purchase if you are into the Beatles and/or George Harrison.

0307275639|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was unlike anything I have ever read. I don't usually go for memoir type books or really anything in the non-fiction genres, but I found Tuesdays with Morrie to be crushingly emotional. There were many instances of the bug, ugly cry over while reading this rather short book.<br /><br />The book is so simplistic in its writing, but so profound in the ideas it relates. Accepting death, making your life meaningful, living a spiritual life without religion and truly living your life instead of constantly focusing on what you want in the future are just a few of the many concepts Morrie Schwartz and Mitch Albom discussed as Morrie was dying of Lou Gehrig's disease.<br /><br />Hard subjects are dealt with in Tuesdays with Morrie. Subjects that we often dislike talking or even thinking about. That Morrie was had accepted his death and was able to relate his thoughts on life in this fashion is nothing short of remarkable. He seems to have been an amazing man and I loved the way Albom told the story of his life and death and how it related to himself. It must have been an honor to know a man like Morrie Schwartz.
B0013ND30M|2.0|I was so psyched to see this movie again--I LOVED this when I was a little girl! Sadly, it just isn't all that I remembered it to be--we (the hubby, my 2 year-old and my 5 year-old) almost fell asleep on this movie. It is slow-paced and uninteresting. The music is lame; the premise is lame. The fairies are still as fun as I remembered, but not good enough to carry an entire movie. Lest you think I am too picky, I do want to say that we all enjoyed Snow White, & Cinderella  and both of these movies were made before my mother was born (I am 35 years-old). It is NOT that this movie is old--it's just boring.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This DVD/CD package is such an amazing time capsule.  Many old favorites about to be unveiled to unsuspecting crowd before we were officially introduced to them some months later.  Even though there is a familiarity with the songs, the guitar or piano work is different enough that it makes you really pay attention.  In an age where artists need huge sets, light shows, and other distractions to entertain or engage, this recording with Neil and his musical instrument shows just how satisfying a intimate,intense, and personal performance can be.  I think this may be my personal favorite album of Neil Young's.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I really like Daniel Craig as Bond, so if you don't you might not feel the same about this Bond movie.  Personally, I think he is the best Bond ever and the writing is better than ever.  I enjoyed the old Bonds and the cartoon villains, but I prefer the grittier more realistic (though obviously still not realistic) style in the new movies.    This is the first Bond that doesn't entirely stand by itself, as it is part II of two part story.
B002VWONB2|4.0|Film critic Jeffrey Lyons once said of Casablanca: \\"They don't make movies any better.\\"   He's pretty close to perfect on that one.  This is a marvelous film, despite the fits and starts of production that are noted in history.  The cast (Bogart, Bergman, Henreid) is nothing short of outstanding, with wonderful supporting roles from Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Conrad Veidt.  The blu-ray transfer is good -- but not great -- and I thought perhaps they might have tried to spruce up the soundtrack a bit, but my observation is that it sounds no better than the conventional DVD audio version. And it's center channel mono only. But for 1942, it's about as good as you can expect.  Another minor annoyance: There is no enhanced widescreen 16X9 version, only the 1.33:1 aspect, but switching to the Horizontal Fill position on my Panasonic flat screen fills the screen without measurable loss of content.  However, these shortcomings do nothing to take away from the film's enduring attraction to audiences of all ages.  It's well worth the investment.
B00000272N|5.0|This disc is excellent and one of the best 'Grunge' releases. Some may see the Nirvana or Soundgarden as the blueprint for grunge, but this was without a doubt the darkest, heaviest and sickest disc to come out in the pubescent grunge era.<br /><br />The thing I always thought was strange that this was on CBS records. This disc is full of drug induced lyrics and very depressing subject matter that are also biographical I am sure. The dark chords and backing vocals with Layne's extremely distraught delivery still gets me to this day. Sludgy, slow paced and heavy as hell. This is not the usual par in which a major label, especially the largest at the time, would reach out and sign this type of a band. This was not 'safe'. I bought this on cassette back in 91 and it took me a few listens, but boy was I hooked. And it still hasn't gotten old.<br /><br />The songs are slow and powerful. 'Man in The Box' was the Radio track and a great one at that. But the other tracks are clearly ones that would not shake up the masses like the follow up 'Dirt' did. But what these tracks lacked in production, they made up for in power. Now that Layne is gone, you can almost feel the pain in the delivery to these tracks. Painful, real and even cold at times. Lyrically it is just bleak filled with desperation. Much like someone with demons would have.<br /><br />Down tuned Guitars deliver the grooves and there are some good ones. Jerry Cantrell had simple riffs, but ones that would penetrate your mind, insisting on more listens. From the dark bar chords of 'Its Not Like That' to the heavy 'We Die Young', these tracks are blistering but not in a fast way. Just a complete  trance like style. The best tracks are the draggers though.<br /><br />'Sunshine' is INCREDIBLE! Its a strange track that plods along with great Vocal harmonies and really good soloing. One of the bands very best.<br /><br />Other great tracks are 'Bleed The Freak', 'Confusion', 'It Aint Like That' (Sick), 'I Cant Remember' and 'Man In The Box'. These songs are just awesome and are 100% classics. Slow, Grinding and dark but strong. Slow to Heavy, with Layne Staley giving a very honest vocal delivery.<br /><br />There are also riff-oriented, mid paced tracks like 'Cant Put You Down', 'Real Thing', 'We Die Young' and 'I Know Something' that make this disc flow well and feature some good chord progressions and choruses. Without these songs, this disc would make you want to bury yourself. They are needed to offset the slow dirges.<br /><br />This was what got me into the grunge era in '91 because I took a chance on it in a record store. The start of what would be a series of good discs. Granted, it takes more listens than the next releases 'Dirt' and 'AIC', but in my opinion it is more rewarding. It is raw, emotional and real. A must for anyone who liked this style of music. A truly dark vibe flows through this CD and it can never be recaptured. This is THE best Grunge era disc that still holds up 20 years later. One of the best cd's ever.me and are 100% classics. Slow, Grinding and dark but strong. Slow to Heavy, with Layne Staley giving a very honest vocal delivery.

0307269760|4.0|Alice Munro can always be depended on for a great short story collection every few years, and last year's Too Much Happiness is no exception.    As usual, most of the stories center on small-town Canadians, like Munro herself. (The only exception is `Too Much Happiness', which is based on the life of 19th century Russian mathematician and novelist Sophia Kovalesky)  As usual, she writes with an almost anthropological precision in detailing the lives of her characters.  As usual, she wonders us with her ability to put a novel's worth of life and wisdom into her thirty page stories.      My favorites were `Dimensions', in which a mother who has lost her three children finds enlightenment in a stunning way, `Fiction' in which a woman discovers an ex-student has achieved literary success only to learn there is another, more painful memory from the distant past that ties them, the O'Connor-esque `Free Radicals' in which a dying woman is forced to face her past by a fleeing murderer, and the wonderfully crafted and haunting `Child's Play', which spans sixty years to tell of a single moment of cruelty shared by two girls at summer camp.     With this collection, Munro shows us that, even at 78, she is still the queen of the short story.
0452284392|5.0|This book describes the emergence of an important new area of science, and it's written by Alberto-Laszlo Barabasi, one of the pioneers and leaders in the field.  The writing is clear and engaging, so the book should be fairly easy to read by general readers reasonably comfortable with science.  Accommodating such a broad audience does limit the technical depth, but there's still plenty of detail, and the book has abundant endnotes which go into further detail and also link the book with the professional literature (pun intended).<br /><br />The systematic presentation of the book makes it fairly easy to summarize:<br /><br />(1) Many systems are complex, and thus are not amenable to conventional reductionism.  Instead, complex systems typically involve networks.<br /><br />(2) The study of networks began with \\"simple\\" graph theory, and then progressed to random networks in which most nodes have the about the same number of links.<br /><br />(3) Real-world networks tend to be \\"small worlds\\" in the sense that the shortest path from a given node to any other node is typically only several links.  This is the case even for networks with millions or billions of nodes.<br /><br />(4) Rather than being entirely random, real-world networks tend to display clustering, with \\"weak links\\" between clusters.  These weak links, which may be random, are the key to making these networks small worlds.<br /><br />(5) Small-world networks tend to have a minority of highly-linked \\"hub\\" nodes which shorten the average path between nodes.  More precisely, such networks tend to have a hierarchical scale-free structure (topology) which follows a power law with an exponent of 2 to 3, such that there are many nodes with few links and progressively fewer nodes as the number of links per node increases (again, hub nodes have the most links).  (By the way, the ratings of this book roughly follow a power law distribution.)<br /><br />(6) Scale-free structure in networks is largely the result of a preferential attachment process in which well-connected and competitively fitter nodes have a greater ability to attract further links as the network grows (\\"the rich get richer\\").  If a single node has dominant fitness, a \\"winner takes all\\" effect can occur in which the network develops a star structure rather than a scale-free structure.<br /><br />(7) Unlike random networks, scale-free networks are robust against even a large number of random removals of nodes.  This is largely because the minority of hub nodes keeps the network connected.  However, targeted removal of several hub nodes (~5% to 15%) can cause a scale-free network to collapse (loose connectivity), thus making such networks vulnerable to attack.  The problem is compounded if such networks are vulnerable to cascading failures.<br /><br />(8) Viruses, fads, information, etc. can readily spread in scale-free networks because there is no minimum threshold which the spreading rate needs to exceed.<br /><br />(9) Because the links in the Web are directed, the Web doesn't form a single homogeneous network, but rather has a fragmented structure involving four major \\"continents\\" and some \\"islands\\", and there is fragmentation within these continents as well.<br /><br />(10) Behavior of living cells is controlled by multiple layers of networks, including regulatory and metabolic networks.  These networks typically have a scale-free structure with an average path length of about three.  Across organisms, the hubs in these networks tend to be the same, but the other nodes (molecules) vary widely.  This is why targeting drugs at hubs can be both effective and can have side effects (presumably, the key is to find and target hubs which are specific to disease states, if such hubs exist).<br /><br />(11) The economy is a network in which hub organizations tend to accumulate links as the network grows by absorbing smaller nodes through mergers and acquisitions.<br /><br />(12) Highly \\"optimized\\" organizations witha tight hierarchy tend to be less adaptive than networked organizations, and thus susceptible to failure.<br /><br />(13)  Networked economies are susceptible to cascading failures, especially when the hubs become \\"too big to fail\\" (Barabasi's warning here was of course all too accurate).<br /><br />(14) Real networks tend to have a hierarchically modular structure, while still being scale-free.<br /><br />The only significant \\"negative\\" is that this book came out in 2002/2003, whereas network science has continued to develop since then.  However, Barabasi has another book ([[ASIN:0525951601 Bursts: The Hidden Pattern Behind Everything We Do]]) coming out in just a few weeks, which should bring us up to date, and it makes sense to read \\"Linked\\" first, so that you can start at the beginning.  Very highly recommended.a tight hierarchy tend to be less adaptive than networked organizations, and thus susceptible to failure.<br /><br />(13)  Networked economies are susceptible to cascading failures, especially when the hubs become \\"too big to fail\\" (Barabasi's warning here was of course all too accurate).<br /><br />(14) Real networks tend to have a hierarchically modular structure, while still being scale-free.<br /><br />The only significant \\"negative\\" is that this book came out in 2002/2003, whereas network science has continued to develop since then.

B001EN71DG|4.0|Thank you producer Gary Kurtz, writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, director Irvin Kershner. And Stuart Freeborn and Frank Oz for Yoda. Also much appreciation goes to actor Harrison Ford for changing his line from what Lucas wrote and therefor making what would have been a corny, poorly written scene into one of the classic moments of the entire saga.<br /><br />The story behind the greatest Star Wars film is incredible to me.<br /><br />This is excerpted from wikipedia (because I'm feelin' lazy as Lucas in writing here):<br />\\"During filming of The Empire Strikes Back George Lucas suffered an apparent panic attack, accusing the filmmakers of ruining his movie. He followed this by taking the existing footage into an editing bay and cut together a fast-paced action version of early scenes, excising plot-oriented content, then showed it to Kurtz and other members of cast and crew, who reacted with laughter. Lucas later admitted this was a mistake(.....)<br />Even after the financial success of The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas regarded The Empire Strikes Back as a failure. It was after this pronouncement that Kurtz and Lucas parted company.<br />It is notable that the more mystical aspects of the Jedi were absent from Star Wars films following Kurtz's departure, while similar mystical elements appeared in Kurtz's later muppet fantasy film The Dark Crystal. Lucas' replacement of mystical or spiritual explanations with more scientific-seeming explanations such as midichlorians in the Star Wars prequels has faced heavy criticism from Star Wars fans.\\"<br /><br />\\"A failure\\", said George Lucas of The Empire Strikes Back. The undisputed fan favorite and favorite of film critics is a failure to George Lucas and his least favorite Star Wars film.<br /><br />This shouldn't surprise anyone either:<br />\\"After Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, Lucas became convinced that audiences no longer cared about the story; they were simply there for thrills and entertainment, and he began to deviate from the original nine-episode bible starting with Return of the Jedi, at which point Kurtz quit the series\\".isode bible starting with Return of the Jedi, at which point Kurtz quit the series\\".
1897093527|3.0|This collection of `adventures' is plain proof why Sherlock Holmes is a household name in solving mysteries. Sometimes it only takes the full account of the victim or witness right there in his room at Baker Street, and before hands-on investigation is suggested, Holmes unsettles everyone by stating that he has more or less solved the case.    It is indubitably no mean feat that Arthur Conan Doyle was able to present succinct mystery cases within a few pages. If for nothing else, that is enough to commend him. Quick mystery fixes, indeed.    Certainly I enjoyed The Adventure of the Speckled Band, The Boscombe Valley Mystery, and (to an extent) The Man with the Twisted Lip. The other short adventures...well, some of them left me hanging. Unsatisfied. Disgruntled. Incredulous.     Case in point: The Five Orange Pips - really, the KKK? The story served nothing save to prove that the author had knowledge of this group. But as to incorporating something fictionalized about them, he fell short. It would have been better if he never bothered with this kind of plot.    And The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb felt like a joke. The only mystery here is why Holmes made any effort to solve it in the first place.    Even the last one, The Adventure of the Copper Beeches became too predictable it was a disappointment when one's guesses proved right.     And yes...I am acting like a tool.     Who the heck am I to criticize works of fiction placed in snugly in the pantheon of classical literature?    But there it is. I am 50/50 about this collection. It is more than worth reading if only to discover how the veritable Holmes went about his cases. But then, coming on the heels of my recent trawling through Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot mysteries...Holmes unfortunately forlornly appears a diminished figure.    Yeah, yeah. I know. My chronology's all skewed. But the damage is done...
B001K3JF7K|3.0|I really wanted to like this CD; I've enjoyed all her previous brilliant work, so it is hard to give this a low rating. It seems like someone wanted to make a completely different album, instead of a Diana Krall album. Why, after all her previous gems, would anyone want to do that? The first thing I noticed was how \\"breathy\\" her voice sounded. She doesn't HAVE a breathy tone...think of the power she's achieved on \\"The Best Thing for You (Would Be Me)\\", \\"This Can't Be Love\\", \\"Frim Fram Sauce\\" or even \\"Jingle Bells\\", (from her stellar Christmas release [[ASIN:B000B7BRMM Diana Krall Christmas Songs]] ). Second thing that hit me was: this album features one after another, after another, slow-paced pieces. Where are the fast numbers like \\"The Best Thing for You (Would Be Me)\\", from [[ASIN:B00000J7S8 When I Look in Your Eyes]] ??? And where and WHY would any producer hide her piano? I just don't get it; there's almost no piano improvisation on this album. Either it's buried or not in the mix at all. It's not a total loss; \\"Too Marvelous For Words\\" has some piano improvisation, and the nuances featured on [[ASIN:B000SO7OL6 The Very Best of Diana Krall]] or from [[ASIN:B00000J7S8 When I Look in Your Eyes]]. Her take on Bacharach's \\"Walk On By\\" also remind me of her best work. I've always thought a Burt Bacharach tribute album would be a good idea for Diana Krall, with all of his twists & turns, changing tempos and key changes. Maybe an album like that would have been a better idea, since it might feature her vocal AND piano prowess a lot better than this.
0060254920|5.0|I confess to not being the kind of person who is overly fond of children. I don't gravitate towards them, and I think the little ones can sense that - so they keep away from me. And in the end, we're both left happy.<br /><br />But that is not to say that I don't empathize with kids. In those rare times that I have to be in the company of a gaggle of young ones, I find out how smart and even introspective they are, and how often they are underestimated by adults.<br /><br />And that's why I appreciate Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are. Hardly a hundred pages, but it managed to convey how earnestly simple a child's wants are. They can be as audacious and precocious as they want to be, but, in the end, what it all comes down to is their expression of their need for love and attention.<br /><br />Sendak's book also imparts how richly endless a child's imagination is. Something that is slowly forgotten as one grows up into adulthood. Such imagination is often supplanted later on with cynicism and distrust.<br /><br />All in all, this little book full of iconic, elegant illustrations is sure to be a treat to little kids. I may not volunteer to read it to them (I'm really not that kind of a person), but I won't hesitate handing it over as a present.

B00008LDPU|4.0|I found this film a valuable addition to understanding the Matrix universe and the story behind it. The various interpretations of the material from different directors was interesting and entertaining. Some of the ethical implications and animations were lacking, but overall certainly worth it. I found the piece on 'The Kid' most satisfying.
B00005N83M|5.0|Ok, so I found this CD a long time ago in the bargain bin. I never got around listening to it because the urge never striked me. So today, I decided to update my Touch and listen to it for the first time. I actually like it! Yea, it's old but it's just fun music. I paid almost nothing (literally) for it but honestly, I would pay retail for it! I'm excited to hear that she is coming out with something new this year. I will be buying it. But for now, I'll be listening to this :)
B002VWONB2|4.0|This is a great film no matter the format. You should have this film if you like older films, especially a classic Bogart film like this, and Ingrid is a beautiful as ever.  We ordered the bluray version when we forgot we already had the regular dvd version.  Anyway, the bluray version is good quality but I do not think it is noticeably better than the regular dvd version, so I don't recommend getting the bluray-that's why the 4 stars.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Came across Celtic Woman through browsing Youtube choral groups. There was a freshness and purity about the singing that put the group way ahead of others I had listened to. Tone, pitch, production were so well matched and blended so well, with no one trying to outshine the others, that it was a delight to listen to. Unity of voice and interpretation that would be very hard to match. The violin accompliment and solo peices from Mairead was like watching a sprite flit across the stage. The energy of the Irish music was matched by the singers to the point where it was impossible to keep my feet still. The Blane Castle concert gives my irish soul a lift every time I play it. If you have Celtic blood in your veins, this is a must.
B002ZG97RY|5.0|Green zone ia amazing the action of the film is evenly split with a great political story. matt damon does an amazing job of acting and in my opinion he does a better job of acting in this film than he did in the great films of the bourne series. non stop suspense, not a predictable plot, just a great film all around. really makes you think if this actually happened during the corrupt bush administration. kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. great buy for the blu ray or dvd.
B0037W68F4|5.0|Here's my review of MGMT's sophomore release after listening to it a couple of times (trust me - you do need to give the CD at least 3 spins before understanding it). The album is schizophrenic, psychedelic and pretty much amazingly amazing.    I initially hated \\"Flash Delirium\\". Silly, stupid me. Never gave it enough chance, wrote it off as a piece of the band's self-indulgent nonsensical composition. Luckily I didn't let the initial write-off last. I heard it again, and again, and again, and now I love it. You could actually pick up the very Beatle-esque influence in the song. In fact, CONGRATULATIONS is laced with so many Beatles nuances. Some \\"doo-wop\\" flavour here and there, some \\"Beach Boys\\" influences, and then they go and throw in Beck's sensibilities as found on MIDNITE VULTURES and mix it all up with synthesizers. The result you get is a concoction that goes up in one big colourful puff of smoke. And it's perfect.    MGMT had already hinted at CONGRATULATIONS in the songs that everyone ignored on ORACULAR SPECTACULAR. And the reason those tracks were ignored was because of the gigantic hits the band had. Hence it all now makes sense why MGMT chose not to write any \\"singles\\" on the album. And amongst all the chaos and insanity and multiple tracks squashed into a track, CONGRATULATIONS holds up extremely well as an album with identity, class and believe it or not, consistency.     I strongly recommend this album to anyone who is an \\"album\\" person. If you go after downloading singles off iTunes, proceed with caution.    Liam F.  April 18, 2010

0670021652|1.0|I was eagerly awaiting the next book by Elizabeth Gilbert.  I had enjoyed Eat, Pray, Love so much, and was hoping to hear more about ther view of marriage.  Instead, it was a totally distant, sociological treatise on marriage.   Not what I was expecting.  I did not feel Liz's voice at all in this book.  In fact, it seems that almost anyone could have written it.
B0038P59A0|5.0|3 of us watched this movie, and we all loved it. It was super fun. R.D. jr. is a great actor, as is the rest of the crew in this film. I like all the \\"logic\\" stuff. I hope they make another one.
B00081912E|4.0|Mask is a very entertaining movie and this disk also has interesting special features including how they discovered Cameron Diaz.  The production of special features, however, is to be desired.  And the DTS part of the sound track is 6.1, not very easy to playback (Dolby is 5.1).
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|Usually I only bring out an amazon comment when I dislike something. Just a few minutes ago I was able to watch this movie on cable. Sometimes you have to give credit where its due. The diversity of emotions felt during the viewing was amazing. It's an old movie, most people have probably seen this but it's still so good and honest. These types of movies are what Hollywood should be producing.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|This is a great album!  I especially like Hello World.  It is one of those albums that is easy to listen to from beginning to end!
B001FB4VZS|4.0|After 7 seasons, I really thought this show was on its way out the door. Lex and Clark's friendship is dead. The Lana and Clark romance had overstayed its welcome. And how many more lame meteor freaks do we need to see Clark stop yet again? I was pleasantly surprised to see that the exits of Lana and Lex and the entrance of Tess Mercer rejuvenated this 2001 show. As Amazon and other reviewers have stated, Tess is the perfect replacement for Lex Luthor. Is she friend or foe, you be the judge. For those traditional Superman fans, finally the relationship of Lois and Clark gets the spotlight. Also, one of Superman's most powerful enemies, Doomsday appears this season. And although Michael Rosenbaum doesn't appear on screen, Lex Luthor's presence this season is just as big and important as it ever was while he lurks behind the scenes. That's all I will reveal as I don't want to spoil it. For those of you that were getting sick of this show, season 8 has made me fall in love with this series all over again.
1844137872|5.0|I've been following Banksy for quite some time now, mostly through his own website but when I received this book it had much more in it then I had seen before.    My favourite part is a summary (with pictures) of al the museums he's been to, where he tried to put up some of his own art.    The book is mainly pictures, with some quotes and short stories, for anybody who knows Banksy, it really is worth while! If you don't know Banksy but like rebelious art, it is worth your while!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|BEST MOVIE DISNEY HAS PUT OUT IN YEARS.  GREAT STORY WITH MORALES AND VALUES BEING AT CENTER STAGE. THE MUSIC IS ADDICTING!!
B00005V9IK|2.0|The effects are great, the acting is about what you'd expect, the story's a zero.  If you have something that has to be done and you've already used up all the good excuses, uncork a jug of (cheap)wine, get out the chips and dip and ask wifey if she'd like to take a break from her hard labour.      If you remember what a disappointment Erwin Allen movies always were and how you somehow sat thru them anyway, you know what you're in for.    Like Irwin Allen, there was enough money to make this turkey pleasent to watch, there is some good acting, but whenever logic gets in the way of plot, forget the logic.      (...Other than getting to spend some time goofin' off with the wife, maybe doing the dishes would be better)
B000WS4OUW|5.0|I had to put a review down for this album! I first bought this album in 1994 and by accident left it in a friends car out in Arizona. I called and told him to keep it and I bought another! now he's a fan of Danzig. Anyway still to this day I listen to it weekly. I would be safe to say almost daily (In the car, MP3 working out, Playing Bass to it, ETC).     It is by far one of Glenn Danzig's best albums IMO. I have been a Danzig fan since I first bought this album and over time bought all his others. But unlike this one, The other albums had to \\"grow\\" on me overtime. Not Lucifuge II! EVERY song is great and was rated in the top 50 albums of the 90's I read last year. Even Metallica said it should have gotten album of the year over their Black album of the same year! I can not say enough about this album. I tell people if I had only one album to choose from out of all of Glenn's works to listen to the rest of my life it would be Lucifuge!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Great album!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|****Spoiler Alert*****<br /><br />This program follows 3 Marine heroes, their comrades and their sacrifice against a fearless enemy. You will feel every emotion as you watch this epic series. There are several scenes that will never leave your mind. This is an accurate depiction of combat in the Pacific theatre. Its very inhumane at times and not always easy to watch. Having said that-its something everyone should see, regardless of your interest in World War 2.  The level of detail and battle sequences are amazing. The amphibious landings and the hell thats thrown at these guys is unthinkable. The fact that the Pacific war isn't covered enough, makes this educational for some and intriguing to everyone. Thanks to Clint Eastwoods great movies(Letters From Iwo Jima, Flags Of Our Fathers) and Speilberg/Hanks -The Pacific, we are starting to get some great coverage in this area.  Of more importance, the men who gave so much are getting the recognition they deserve.<br /><br />I have read some of the other reviews here and I can't understand the anti- reviews. This is not Band Of Brothers Part 2, its not trying to be that series. This series is much more personal. We get to see how bad the fighting was and how it changes these men. This series focuses on 3 marines, instead of a platoon of guys and their leaders.  Band Of Brothers is awesome, everyone knows that. BOB was also 8 years ago and its had its day in the sun. We all have it on dvd and will enjoy it the rest of our lives. I think some people have let the past 8 years of BOB marinate in their minds. Instead of coming into this series with an open mind, people were ready to pick it apart, because they love BOB so much. I think once this set comes out on blu ray and you can spend a weekend enjoying what a great series it is, you will see that it stands on its own. I heard one guy after the first episode say \\" its slow, I hope it will pick up\\" . The first episode of BOB was boot camp and getting ready for D-day- that was a slow episode, but very enjoyable- just like this episode one. But in this series the marines are already on Guadalcanal and the action has begun in earnest.Makes no sense.<br /><br />One of many aspects I enjoy about The Pacific is the time the soldiers spend away from the battlefield. I think they do a great job showing whats on these guys minds, what they have to fight for and how their fate on the battlefield effects so many. Theres an episode where they are stationed in Australia and you can see how some Aussies can't wait for them to leave. While others fall in love with the soldiers or welcome them into their lives. Its a dynamic of war that is easier to cover in a series this long.<br /><br />The Marines weren't just fighting a fearless, well trained enemy- they were fighting the jungle as well. Which is also well covered in the series. I can't imagine living in these conditions, let alone fighting the Japanese. The diseases and lack of proper supplies killed thousands of soldiers(on both sides), who didn't have the chance to decide their fate on the field.<br /><br />The acting is well done by the 3 main performers portraying Basilone, Leckie and Sledge. The chemistry between Jon Seda(Basilone) and Annie Parrise(Lena) is hard to find. I thought the episode where they meet, fall in love , marry and seperate because of Basilone's Iwo Jima mission was one of the best in the series. It seemed like every episode was better than the previous. It kept getting better. There are many episodes and moments that make this great. The 3 episodes that encompass the Pelieu battle are intense, brutal and realistic for battle. I feel like the brutality and ruthless battle of the Pacific war is captured very well here. This warfare is much different from the European theatre. The Japanese won't surrender when the odds look grim like the Germans did countless times.  It gives the viewer an idea of how savage the fighting in the Pacific would have been. There is a scenewhere the Marines are trying to cross an airfield- but the Japanese are waiting and ready. The following moments are above what we have seen in Saving Private Ryan for graphic war violence. For a good while its unrelenting. Another moment that will stay with you is when Sledge is on Okinawa- the last battle. He enters a small shelter to find a crying baby. When he looks around he finds a woman close to death. She wants him to kill her to end her pain, even putting his gun to her head. But he is done killing. Its a powerful moment. There are good hearted moments to find too. The episode where the Marines are in Australia is great. And the final episode finds the soldiers trying to make a life for themselves in post war America. Several find love and begin fresh. Leckie(James Dale)who earler in Australia lost love, finds love with the woman he had been writing too throughout the war. Although he never sends the letters- figuring he wouldn't survive the war!  The people who made the Island sets should be given praise too. The battlefields are very realistic.<br /><br />The special features are definatley worth your time. The first section covers several marines with profiles lasting around 10 minutes per marine. Some of the interviews are from several years ago, when they were still alive. Its priceless archival footage of our countries heroes. There is a making of \\"The Pacific\\" feature that covers all the research that went into making th sets and recreating the battles. Extremely impressive! This is top shelf film making here. The final section covers the reasons for the savagery of both sides in this war. As well as helping some to understand the conflicts of cultures.<br /><br />I would recommend this series to anyone who has an interest in World War 2, film making, great story telling and those who like to feel the spectrum of emotions when watching something this good.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|I have been a fan of horror for years and this sudden Eli Roth makes scary films bandwagon that people are on is crazy. I think in several years people will look back and see that he doesn't have the darkness as a person to make an effective horror film. Like one person had said on a review I was reading earlier, Eli is a cancer to the horror industry!    Now to the movie. I give Eli credit on the idea. It was a good \\"Idea\\". But after that this became another WAY to overrated Hollywood films. I watched it just from all the people telling me how scary it was. I was really hoping Hollywood had finally made a movie that could compete with the French or Asian horror films. I was wrong. It was another torture porn style film.      If people want to see a movie similar to Hostel's story line then go and get \\"Frontier (s) \\" a french film. Much more brutal and realistic. Plus disturbing. Hostel is in NO way in the same ball game as what the french and Asians are doing. I'm an American and live in the U.S. but if you're a fan of horror do yourself a favor and think outside what Hollywood wants you to believe is scary. Get netflix and rent some movies before buying them. If you want to see scary go with the French. Here are my recommendations.     1 MARTYRS  2 LET THE RIGHT ONE IN  3 AUDITION  4 FRONTIER (S)  5 INSIDE    First I have to say I don't even KNOW how to classify \\"Martyrs\\". It's in it's own category. I never get creeped out by a movie but I watched that one 3 weeks ago and I'm still disturbed by it on so many levels! I don't have a clue what will ever top it. \\"Let the right one in\\" is not as much of a scary movie but more of a perfectly made dark movie that has some very good horror scenes in it. Personally it's my favorite movie of all time.  \\"Audition\\" would of been more disturbing if I hadn't heard all the hype. Still the last 20 minutes are brutal! Well done. This is why I am so impressed with \\"Martyrs\\" is because there hasn't been much buzz about it yet. Keyword YET!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Waaaaaaaahhhhh ! THIS IS SO UNJUST !!!! AAVATAAARRR IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH !
B0019OP0GU|4.0|I'd never read the novel, but rented [[ASIN:B0019OP0GU Ballet Shoes]] for my wife. We liked it. It's a cute movie about three girls growing up and finding out what's really important to them. Each of the three girls goes through a pretty substantial transformation and all have to resolve underlying insecurities. The acting was pretty strong, especially given the age of the actresses in real life. Unfortunately, the movie seemed to end a bit soon. The quirky great-uncle Gum (Richard Griffiths) returns and everything seems fine a bit too quickly. Otherwise, it's great for families, especially pre-teen girls.
B002ZG99D6|5.0|Well while I didn't think this was the best movie ever, I thought it was a great tear-jerker and it was a good story.<br /><br />I do think people need to quit complaining about it not being as good as the book... IT NEVER WILL BE. 2 hours is simply not enough time to develop the characters you know and love or include all the events that happen in the book. So that needs to be put aside, or you people need to not read the book before you go see it. I quit doing that mid-Harry Potter series... I realized re-reading the book right before would only add to my disappointment when I saw the movie. Why not be pleasantly surprised when you read the book after seeing the movie?<br /><br />On the note of the actors, Miley has her moments in this movie, but her more tearful moments I found to be laughable. Pushing \\"Will\\" away? What was that? I do think the scenes she was good in, the scenes with Liam where she is happy, were easy for her, considering she's dating him. In my opinion, she should focus more on music, rather than her acting career. Liam did a good job, he was that cute volleyball player that every girl hopes to have a summer romance with. I didn't love the poor little rich boy approach, I feel like that is fairly overused. That isn't his fault though. The dad and the brother I LOVED. I thought the dad did a good job at being funny and being sick. The brother was that great comedic relief that the movie needed. Very cute. \\"Blaze\\" and her boyfriend couldn't have annoyed me more, I think that whole extra plot line could have been left out.<br /><br />This movie is a Nicholas Sparks movie, so don't expect something happy, it's not gonna happen. However, I recommend seeing it, but don't go in with all these expectations for it being another The Notebook. It's a good movie, not great
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The subject matter is not bunnies and puppies. It can be quite depressing seeing what totalitarian commie government [and Republican] can do to a people. But this movie has its smiles and wait until you see the ending. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that the movie will not leave you depressed. It was much better than I expected. I had to give it 5 stars. We hav vays to make u smile

B001N26GFM|5.0|\\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is an unusual story of the Holocaust.  Bruno (Butterfield) is an eight-year-old boy living in Nazi Germany.  In fact, Bruno's life is great:  he lives in a big house, playing with friends, and enjoying life to the fullest.  His father (Thewlis) is a German officer, and the entire family is proud of him.  That pride grows even larger when the father, an SS officer, gets promoted; a move that requires the entire family to move east to the \\"countryside\\".<br /><br />The first signs that there might be something wrong emerge as Bruno peeks through the window of his room, looking at the strange farmers who all wear pajamas.  Bruno doesn't understand why, upon his inquiry of the strangely dressed people, his window is boarded up, and Bruno is not allowed to play in the back yard.  It is even more strange that one of these farmers works in Bruno's family's kitchen, peeling potatoes and never speaking or even looking up.  Bruno does not understand why this man is peeling the potatoes after he finds out that the man is doctor by training, after Bruno fell and hurt himself.<br /><br />In fact, Bruno does not know that he is living immediately next to Auschwitz and that his father is the Camp commander.  With the typical curiosity of a child, Bruno goes into the thin strip of forest behind his house, and goes all the way to the barbed wire, behind which he encounters a boy his own age; this boy also wore striped pajamas.  The two boys, unaware of the politics, religion, or ancient hatreds, strike up a friendship, each boy lonely and starving for companionship.  And although separated by the barbed wire, the boys look forward to Bruno's sneaking out of the back yard, and to having simple conversations every day.  But Bruno must be careful lest his parents, or one of their mean uniformed soldier friends find out about Bruno's activities.<br /><br />I didn't know what to think about this film.  Heaven knows I have seen many films about the Holocaust, and while each offers something new, there are only so many ways a story could be told.  However, I had to take into account that the story of Bruno is fictional.  The film blew me away.  No, there were no great special effects or super tragic scenes sparkled throughout the movie.  No, the film is made in a very simple manner, which only adds charm to it.  What got me is the irony of the film, especially in the very end.  The screenwriting is simple, photography good, and editing well done.  Acting is a bit stiff, but Butterfield did a good job in his role.  In the end, the movie left me perplexed and deep in thought, a result that I often yearn for.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is a well-done movie with a controversial ending.  One either loves it or hates it, but it doesn't leave the viewer non-chalant.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />*Film viewed via Netflix streaming, hence no special features review.<br /><br />*** This review also published on Epinions.
B00003CX97|2.0|We brought this film as we are going on a holiday to Thailand at the end of the year. We began researching Thailands history and came across this movie in an internet search one day, so we came to amazon and purchased it!<br />It's a story that kept us interested for most of the movie. Towards the end it drags out a little bit, to the point where we actually had a conversation instead of watching it. Overall I'd give it 2.5 stars out of 5.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Steven Spielberg is the director of this great movie that is set back in World War II during the Holocaust. The setting of the movie is one of the most horrific times in history and Oskar Schindler, a German business man, ends up saving the lives of hundreds of Jews by getting them to work in his factory. Schindler is a womanizer that loves money and the finer things in life. He uses these perversions to befriend Nazis and leaders to allow the Jews to work for him. Oskar uses the cheap labor to produce cookware for the Third Reich. Schindler begins to witness the violent killings within the ghetto and wishes by the end of the movie that he had attempted to save more lives. The movie is black and white to mirror the horrendous acts of the Nazi's. The film ends with real Schindler survivors visiting graves. Yes this movie was long, but there was not a moment that I wasn't captivated and wanting to see what happens next.
B000RZGIQ8|4.0|Well, the dialogue is down right corny and the actual \\"in cockpit\\" footage isn't all that great given the fact that this is supposed to be about pilots and their machines, the fact of the matter is, if you loved Top Gun when it first took flight back in the 80's it's all the more reason to see this in HiDef.  The sound track in any set up outside of plain stereo is great and the sounds of the jet engines swooshing by you from front to back and left to right and so on is just booming.  I could do without the sausage fest of the volleyball scene but that was the hook for the female crowd.  I could do with more flight scenes and fight footage but I didn't write the script.  The videos of the songs are a nice inclusion, too.
6304806418|5.0|This intense, moving film left me pondering relationships, governments, and leadership.  Much of the story and emotion is told through the incredible music.  Antonio Banderas and Madonna's singing and acting is fantastic.  The production of the movie is astounding--I don't know that I've seen so many sets, costumes, and extras.<br />I would say that the film is for older teens and adults because of violence and thematic elements.  The portrayal of Eva's sleeping her way up ambition's ladder is for the most part tastefully done--thank you to the filmmakers.<br />A drawback is the DVD had no special features.  I would love to know more about the making of the movie and about Eva Peron.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this reboot of the Star Trek franchise.  The young cast made for a great adventure, reminding us of each of the characters we've long known and seen on TV.  Though this version takes the franchise in a different direction and ultimately alters the Star Trek universe, it is visually exciting and engaging.  I have watched both the DVD and Blu Ray formats and must say the differences can be noted.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis' The Big Short will go a long ways helping anybody wanting to understand how subprime mortages cause the collapse of our financial market. And he does it in a most entertaining way.    Basically there were three kinds of people involved in this debacle: smart, dumb or ugly. The crafty represents the cream of Wall Street and they knew enough to simply created investment instruments out of the thin air that nobody can understand and then acted as the broker between the buyer and seller. They created and sold collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and collected 2% fees on the billions of CDOS sold. Lewis did not identify individuals that belong to this category of players but Goldman Sachs was identified as one Wall Street house that made billions on 2% of billions.    Except for one idiot Lewis identified by name, he assigned Moody's and S&P rating agencies as the stupidest component of this financial scam. He amply showed that they did know their anuses from holes on the ground. Without their triple A rating on a house of cards, the morons that sold the CDOs and thus obliging themselves to make good on billions might not have been so totally oblivious to the risks.    There were winners that profited hugely from the financial collapse. Lewis made his book entertaining by following the lives some of the individuals that won big and the process they undertook to get to the point where they concluded that everybody else was crazy and easy money was there to be made. Lewis name these individuals and presented profiles of their personalities and foibles. These were not pretty boys and girls that inhabit the mainstream of Wall Street. They dwell on the fringe and have different outlook on life and values. Not encumbered by general accepted views, their twisted thinking allow them to see through the scams and make killings. They were contraians to the extreme.     The takeaways from this book are: (1) You still can't believe in what Wall Street tells you. (2)The rating agencies don't know what they are talking about. (3) There is no substitute for doing your own homework. (I agree with another reviewer. This book sure could have used an index.)
0060786523|2.0|There are many things about life in India that make it both charming and disconcerting to the average Western (or Westernized) Indian observer.  The significant burden on the Indian writer is to explain and inform about a culture, which although fast evolving, will always remain mysterious, even exasperating,  to someone not living there. It may be that, as Kipling noted, that 'never the twain shall meet'   I admire Vikram Seth - his 1986 'Golden Gate' was truly groundbreaking - but here he falls into the familiar trap of the Indian writer, addressing a Western audience,  of trying to romanticize India too much, with some sordid parts thrown in to achieve 'unmagical' realism.         I am still waiting for the Indian novel that offers true comment on Indian ethos and society , or the search for meaning or purpose in an average Indian's life - not some varnished fairy tale, with too much phony glamour and romance.       And there is the length.   Tolstoy's War & Peace may be  for the Victorian age and sitting through a long Russian winter without sex or TV, but this book is about 10 times too long, saying too little,  for an age when there are plenty of good dramas on TV and certainly plenty of other 'distractions' - and not just on the Internet:-)
0061766089|2.0|I recently went to see Tim Brown speak about how design thinking can be used to accomplish more than the next must-have consumer electronic device.    I left the speech inspired.      Although I was quite familiar with the design thinking approach, I hadn't seen it applied to important problems like helping people that don't have immediate access to water.  As I was leaving, I purchased this book, hoping to carry some of that inspiration with me.  I work for a start-up that is trying to solve a big problem, so I was looking for some tips.    My 2 star review is a product of what I think this book is, but also what this book should be.    Tim spends the majority of the time explaining how awesome IDEO was in solving big problems that clients brought to them.  Literally, it reads like an autobiography, because an anecdote about IDEO is on almost every page.  But I didn't purchase this book to just learn about what IDEO has managed to accomplish with its unique culture.  I wanted this book to give me real tools that I could apply to my start-up.       It's interesting:  Design thinking is all about getting in the head of the people whose problem you're trying to solve.  This book, whose audience is (I'm venturing a guess) primarily business people, probably need help defining processes and methodologies for bringing design thinking to their organization.   But Tim has missed the mark with this book by not truly understanding his audience.
B001DHE9KG|1.0|This live performance of Puccini's La Boheme is a recording  with the best singers including Angela Gheorghiuo as Mimi, and Ramon Vargas as Rudolpho.   I know is was an excellent performance as I played it once. The DVD stopped working after the first time.    Rather than never being able to hear it again I bought another copy of the same recording at the Met Store and have had no trouble with it.

B0028DRGDQ|4.0|After viewing and enjoying Quarantine, I learned that it was a remake of a Spanish language film called Rec (as in \\"record\\"). First things first. If you see Quarantine first, you'll realize how it's a near copycat of the original. There are a few differences: some characters are added while some are deleted entirely, the causes behind the \\"infection\\" share nothing in common, and of course the differences in language and location. Everything else is almost identical, right down to the set and more than a few of the shots. Rec improves on parts of it's American counterpart, most of all a scene that shocked the actors because they had no idea it was coming. Their genuine horror makes Quarantine's characters response border on the unfazed. Another amazing fact is that only a few of the actors in the film are \\"legit\\". Most of the performers had never acted before, but you'd never guess it since they're so believable. Another improvement over Quarantine is the reveal of the final character. A creature really. It's not CGI although it looks like it. Perfect! I can't say which film is the best because both have what the other lacks imo. I suggest giving both a try to come to your own conclusion. You're guaranteed entertainment.
B001FB4W0C|4.0|I pretty much turned off the TV for good about six years ago. Pity, because I missed the first three seasons of this series.<br /><br />I took a chance on the 4th season of Supernatural, which I found on sale at a local establishment at a giveaway price. I am utterly amazed at the quality of this TV series.<br /><br />Supernatural combines elements of good storytelling with pretty decent action. Its a fine example of what can be done with a TV series. There are times where it can be annoying, however. For example episode 14, Sam and Dean get saved from killing each other by Uncle Bobby in a classic deus ex machina. Uncle Bobby just comes from out of nowhere and saves the boys from beating each other to a pulp. Trite, boring, yuck, ew[...] Thankfully there isn't too much of that in this series.<br /><br />I enjoy the classic '67 Chevy, Dean's looks too nice if it has been driven across the country hunting ghosts and demons. You've got to keep a car like that in a garage and spend some serious time working on it for it to look like that. Uncle Bobby's is more what I would expect, except he doesn't really go anywhere and spends alot of time at home. Shouldn't he have the near perfect Impala?<br /><br />I also enjoy the angels versus demons battles. Sort of takes me back to reading Milton, where Satan was the faux-hero. Curiously these themes don't really seem out of place either for a fantasy/sci-fi TV series. The prophet episode may have been over the top, where an all-powerful angel appears to save the day. Puh-lease. Where is this angel when the apocalypse is about to happen?<br /><br />I don't enjoy Dean's diatribes to his brother or his 'anguish' about what he did downstairs. If the guy has to speak more than two sentences, it annoys me. Get back to the ghosts. Anguish should make you a better hunter, not whining to the camera.<br /><br />Overall, its a great series.
B002G1K82Q|4.0|Sure, \\"Across the Universe\\" was a commercial flop, but that economic reality does not mean that the movie is not worth watching.  For one, it introduced me to Dana Fuchs, a Janis Joplin-like singer, and her power is terrific.  In addition, any number of the other actors, from minor to major, performed well, albeit in the context of a somewhat muddied storyline and production layout. I found the intercutting between songs of the past effective, if somewhat distracting (and I am not a fan of much of the Beatles's music, except as a cultural phenomenon). That the movie ends on an unrepentently happy note is a bit sacharrine, but we can all use a lift these days.    On the other hand, it is definitely a metaphor for and an insight into the civil rights campaigns and anti-war days of the Viet Nam era.  I won't say it's a profound recollection of the strife, confusion, and tension of the times, but, to those of us who lived through those days, it's an intriguing political reminder.  To make allusions to Iraq or Afghanistan is spurious; today's dissent is peanuts compared to the societal turmoil of the sixties and the seventies.    This flick is worth buying to give to the kids, and grandkids, of those of us whose thought processes were shaped by those years.  Given the need for visual stimulation to get young people to pay attention to anything these days, putting up with some hokey acid-trip celluloid is acceptable.
B0035V35P8|5.0|Even though I'm a fan of samurai films, I thought this would be a complete hokey b-movie. Boy was I proven right and wrong, haha: I already knew what it was coming into it; i.e. you should never take an action movie's plot too seriously.     This movie made me remember the days as a kid imagining what if ninjas really could step in and out of shadows like it was a door hole in the wall. Definitely one of the bloodiest action movies I have seen where the attacks look straight out of Ninja Scroll or as if Ryuei Kitamura directed it; e.g. improbably slicing legs off clean with a kusarigama, and jumping ninjas in half with a katana. It fits the description both words: ridiculously cool, but the average viewer will lean towards either ridiculous or cool. Rain as a the protagonist was amazing showing off his handstand push-ups and acrobatic free-running/parkour as the true art of a ninja. It's weird to think Rain is an actual singer from Korea but making his lead role as a martial artist (probably the only way Asians can get lead roles since it's stereo-type-cast).    One thing it did show promise in was breaking a stereotype, but fell short. I was hoping that they would've played more on is the racy (pun intended) inter-racial potential romance between characters Raizo (Rain) and Mika (Naomie Harris). I've seen a black woman with an asian man once before and it got heads turning. This would have been original as it hasn't been done since Romeo Must Die with Aliyah and Jet Li (which was also implied rather than showed) and since ABCs broadcast show Flashforward between Gabrielle Union and John Cho being the only physical romance shown. I guess the movie industry is still warming up to this idea (after all we have a democrat black president).    I did get angry at the scene where the movie pitched a German Europol Swat team being over run by ninjas. Hey if Japan really did have ninjas LIKE THAT than I'm pretty sure the US wouldn't have won in WWII. Don't get me wrong, thechoreography made it believable in some areas that a sword beats a rifle, but the opening scene where a kusarigama aka chain and sickle/knife cut a Japanese gangster's sword and body in half. (Research the 21 foot rule aka Tueller drill on defensive shooting)    Do I like this movie, hell yeah. Does it deserve an acting awards....no. It is what I paid for though, a juiced up ride of your life and eyecandy.
0061914177|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I have read in a long time.  Actually it is one of the only books I have read in a long time.  The way he tells you to just get out there and make it happen. Also to care about everyone you meet or are in contact with.  Because if not for those people you would not make it and to hustle.  All I want to say is Gary thanks you so much for the book.  It is an amazing book and it opened my eyes to things I needed to change in my life not just for monetary purposes but just in my life in general and to help better me as a man and a father (know it man be cheesy to say but it is true).
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I was one of those who did not care much for this movie.<br /><br />Based on all the hype leading up to the release, I was expecting a new breakthrough in Special Effects that erased the distinction between reality and animation.<br /><br />Yes, the animation was interesting.... but in no way realistic.<br /><br />Instead the movie felt like being inside a video game.<br />The 3-D was an impressive technology, but for me a story is more important than eye candy, and AVATAR was simply a rehash of Pocohauntus with some subtle modern day political preaching tossed in by James Cameron.<br /><br />So I respect the work that went into making this film.<br />That effort and hard work deserves respect and I would never take that lightly.<br /><br />AVATAR served as an impressive showcase for some new 3D camera technology, but as a movie it left me flat and disinterested.<br /><br />Certainly nothing I would ever care to watch again.<br />In fact, I was so dissapointed by this film I actually walked out of the theatre after about 75 minutes and decided to go SCUBA diving instead that afternoon.
B0035G1K7S|5.0|Listen up those of you in the \\"business\\".  THIS is how you are supposed to make a concert film/music documentary!!  Listen, it is VERY simple.  You actually PLAY some songs without cutting back to the interviews!  You can do that when the song is OVER!!  You also actually show the artists performing without cutting around like some chimpanzee was working the editing machine!  We don't need to have endless cuts every TWO seconds to convey maximum \\"action\\".  Let us actually SEE what is going on man!   I can't remember the last time a quality show like this came out, so glad it did!  OK, This band, WOW, what can you say?  I don't have enough words to describe how incredible they are.  The level of art is so high, the quality of their music is just fantastic!  IF you like rock and roll, you MUST check them out, thank God for the White Stripes.  cheers.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|This movie was better than expected with an original twist tossed in near the end.  (even if you guess it about 5-10 minutes before revealed).<br /><br />It is strange that the father is so quick to defend the new orphan child and not his own family when strange things begin to happen, but they make this credible by portraying the father as a wimpy, useless father and husband.<br /><br />Great acting on the part of the young 13 year old actress who plays Esther in this film ........ she steals almost every scene she is in.

0061876747|4.0|Serendipity plays an important part in the plot of this novel.  Recently divorced, Adam Kindred decides to change his life and return to his native England.  So he resigns his university position in Arizona and applies for a position in London.  On the night of his interview there, he stops for a meal at a local restaurant and meets Dr. Philip Wang, an immunologist heading the development of a new asthma drug for a drug company.  They chat for a few minutes and Wang leaves.  Adam discovers that he left a file behind, and Adam phones him and is invited for a drink when he returns the paper.<br /><br />From this simple encounter flows a series of incidents that change the course of lives and events.  When Adam arrives where Wang is staying, he finds him with a knife protruding from his chest, just barely alive.  Wang urges him to remove the knife, and then dies within a short period of time.  It would appear that Adam interrupted the murderer who had been going through files and searching for something.  Adam leaves the apartment, eventually returning to his hotel, only to be attacked.  Fighting off his attacker, he goes into hiding.<br /><br />The descriptions of a man hiding from the world, separated from all aspects of civilized society, are graphic and disturbing.  Meanwhile, Adam soon determines that it is in his interest to maintain his freedom, not reporting his knowledge of Wang's murder (of which he is accused), and to begin his own investigation to determine exactly what occurred and why.  It is a well-written, exciting albeit disturbing story.  I have to admit that it felt vaguely unfinished, perhaps with a sequel in mind.  Nonetheless, it is recommended.
B002YIHO7I|3.0|I have always felt like music lovers need to listen to Sade' with a mature ear because her music is not meant for everyone When I say everyone, I'm really saying that a teenager probably would not appreciate a Sade' song or record. Having said that, when I was an adolescent, I didn't see what all the hoopla was about. I thought Sade' was quite uninspired and boring even. But I have certainly come to appreciate real music when I hear it and she creates real music.<br /> \\"Soldier of Love\\" is her installment for 2010.  It's a decent album, but it's short and sweet. There are ballads aplenty and the lyrics are thought-provoking. I like the instrumentation, but a large amount of this album is dry, eerie even.  My three picks are \\"The Moon and the Sky\\", \\"Babyfather\\" and \\"In Another Time.\\" Those songs are marvelous. What impressed me more than anything is that her voice sounds as good as it ever did. If you played her debut album and then played this one, you would see that her vocals exacts itself and that's astounding.<br /> 3 stars overall. It is all right at best.<br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br />1. Babyfather<br />2. The Moon and the Sky<br />3. In Another Time<br />4. Morning Bird<br />5. Long Hard Road

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Aside from being a movie which keeps the viewer's interest from beginning to end, this \\"Star Trek\\" movie serves the purpose of tying up a lot of loose ends from the original series.  One comes away with a much better understanding of the characters, and can get much more out of the original episodes when watching them again.  This is a key aspect of the film, since other than its social commentary and obvious allegorical nature, what has always set all of the \\"Star Trek\\" series and movies apart from other SciFi on TV and in theaters is that it is character-driven, rather than depending on the special effects and story lines (though the writers have always been good as well).  This one is no exception.  It's a very good movie, and very well-acted.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|Looking back on How To Train Your Dragon, you're going to remember this amazing movie that moved you, remembering the story, the characters, the animation, but probably not the music. However, if you remember closely, the soundtrack was key to your enjoyment. It punctuated the movie. It put its stamp on classic scenes in the best way possible. John Powell has always been one of the best composers in Hollywood today, but I think this soundtrack is his crowning achievement. Having to incorporate a full range of emotions in this soundtrack, while also keeping to the spirit of the environment, it wasn't an easy task. Rest assured, this is the best soundtrack since Up. And even then, I might debate that it exceeds it.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />This is Berk<br />Forbidden Friendship<br />Test Drive<br />Romantic Fight<br />Sticks & Stones<br /><br />Comparing the flying music for HTTYD & Avatar for instance is no comparison. Avatar doesn't have a track like \\"Test Flight,\\" which is certainly the best soundtrack piece since Up's \\"Married Life.\\" There's just so much life, adventure, enchantment & magic here, it soars in every way possible, and then some. And despite the fact that the track is only a couple minutes long, it uses every second to its full potential. It also serves as the theme to the movie, so it gets played off a variety of splendid way throughout the soundtrack.<br /><br />The rest of the instrumental works also work quite well and they all convey the right range of emotions, from intensity (The Kill Ring), to romantic moments (Romantic Fight), to wonder and playfulness (Forbidden Friendship), to foreboding (Ready The Ships). The whole soundtrack is an absolute wonder with its massive orchestra adding that much of a grander scale to the proceedings, its variety, and its Celtic influences. And when its all said and done, there's an immense sense of satisfaction just by listening to the music here.<br /><br />But as soon as the movie ended, this satisfaction only grew when I heard the song playing over the credits. That song is \\"Sticks & Stones\\" by Sigur R&oacute;s frontman & singer, J&oacute;nsi. It's a mixture of English & Icelandic that fits perfectly into a fast-paced sunny & hopeful indie tune that punctuates the movie in a unexpected way. I mean, you'd expect a lame pop song to play over the credits of a movie like this, not a tune by an indie legend.<br /><br />Overall, for soundtrack lovers, for people that loved the movie, and everybody in-between, the HTTYD soundtrack is an unexpected joyful masterpiece for soundtracks. And it's sure to keep you in the spirit of the wonderful film for a long time to come.the credits. That song is \\"Sticks & Stones\\" by Sigur Rós frontman & singer, Jónsi.

B000JQU1VS|4.0|This is a time honored classic that I never got to read...until now.  It was a very good read and very entertaining.  Of course, while reading through the book I was hearing the voice of Basil Rathbone in the back ground.  (the original Sherlock Holmes for me, not Robert Downey Jr.)  I love a good mystery and these stories were great.  Get in touch with your classics and add this one to your list.
0141439475|5.0|The opening words of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley tell us that we're in for a great ride. And a great ride it is indeed. Filled with lust, confusion, anger, vengeance, pain, death, and most importantly, life, Frankenstein is a work of art that has enthralled readers for almost two centuries, since its publishing date in the year 1818.<br /><br />At the beginning of our story, we're introduced to Robert Walton through his letters to his sister, Margaret Saville. We learn that he is about to embark on a journey that will take him to the top of the world, the northern pole. He excitedly describes the stages he progresses through as he prepares for his trek, but with one complaint. Robert Walton yearns for a friend to share his travels, excitement, and passion for knowledge with.<br /><br />Not too many pages later, we encounter a strange man who joins Walton on his ship near the north pole. This stranger proves to be a friend to Walton, but not quite the friend he was originally yearning for. When the stranger learns of Walton's desire to explore and gain large amounts of knowledge possessed by few others, he tells us his story in an attempt to dissuade Walton from continuing his voyage. The stranger tells us of his life as Victor Frankenstein, creator of the most horrendous monster ever to disgrace the whole of earth with his presence.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this tale written by Mary Shelley. I loved the book and was captivated from the moment I flipped the pages to \\"Letter 1\\".  I would recommend this book to any person who is interested in science and the consequences of playing God.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|One thing I'll say about the film: Michael Moore's documentaries really make you think afterwards. People go about their daily lives and never question some things. It's just \\"the way things are.\\"  I really liked the companies he showed<br />where the workers own and run the company, and not some little stock<br />options, actually own part of it.  A democratic (small d) company.<br />I've seen Sicko, Bowling for Columbine, and Fahrenheit 9/11 and so far he has yet to disappoint me.  I always come away from his documentaries challenging preconceived notions I had at some level.<br /><br />We need more pro-middle-class people like Michael Moore in American popular culture.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I don't understand the low reviews this movie got. Evan Rachel Wood was wonderful, so were the rest of the cast. I guess it takes a certain type of person to understand this film. Sure, the songs were a little different than the way the Beatles performed it, but thats what made it so interesting. I am not a child of the 60's and I wasn't part of Beatle Mania. I only remember some stories of the Vietnam War, (relayed to me by my relatives), however I enjoyed this film wholeheartedly.The choreography was very good also.    I wonder why I haven't heard of this film until today? Probably because its not a typical Hollywood film. Give it a try. You'll either love it or hate it. For me, I loved it!!!
0385341008|4.0|It started off a little slow, but once into it, it was very engaging.  Loved the characters and the stories, sad and deeply human.

B00000IQW3|3.0|I had completely forgotten about The Last Starfighter until my memory was jogged recently by watching the Star Wars prequel reviews by Red Letter Media.  Instructively, what I remembered about this movie was the video game, the trailer park, the alien navigator, the \\"love scene\\" at the lake, the police officer assassin... in short, everything except the CGI space battles, which is what the movie is supposed to be famous for.<br /><br />The Red Letter Media review was correct.  The storytelling in this movie is carried off exceptionally well.  An entire alien existence and extensive backstory are introduced in a matter of minutes and everything makes sense.  Somehow, you care about shallow two-dimensional characters, and even though the ending is predictable early on in the film, you still want to see things played out.  This is a well-crafted '80s movie, arguably from the peak period of cinema sci fi.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the CGI effects are terrible.  And I don't mean they're terrible because they aren't as sophisticated as today's effects.  I mean they're terrible because they limit the film, distract the viewer, and could have been done much better as models, a la the original Star Wars films.  They're so bad that I assumed they weren't the original effects until I started reading about the movie online.  How did the people who made so many right decisions here make such a blooper?<br /><br />Anyhow, the upshot is that this is a mildly enjoyable adolescent fantasy movie.  I guess I'm too old now to take it any more seriously.
B001PN0KSI|5.0|While the socio-political commentary is not lost on me, I love this book for the relationship between Howard and Dominique, and for what happens to the weenie Peter Keating. Setting descriptions are long but beautiful. This book brings much discussion whenever someone at the office (a major record label) is spotted reading it. The new reader unfailingly comes in every couple of days, mouth agape at what has happened in the story.
B002VECMAO|4.0|This is a good movie! If you like the typical \\"boy conquers world, boy gets girl\\" movies, this movie may not be for you... This movie is funny with good story line that is well put together and makes you want to see what is going happen next.

B00280LYIC|4.0|This is a book or a novel that is suppose to entertain....Every book, every story has borrowed ideas from somewhere... West Side Story? Twilight? sounds like Romeo and Juliet.... Look at all the Dracula stories or Werewolves stories... There are so many adaptations of Cinderella from all over the world... In every book you can sense oh I read that somewhere before... It's a great tool for writers to allow their readers to feel comfortable with the story... It gives the readers the background knowledge to appreciate the story more... It's a reference point... It adds to their reading skills as well because it is fluid... they don't have to stop and wonder what's going on... I am rambling...    My point is to read the book for the sole purpose of entertainment... It may resemble another book but there are new antagonist and protagonist that are interesting... Don't take everything to seriously...
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This movie is a treat for true fans of Sherlock Holmes.  The fans who have read all the books and stories and know that the real sherlock homes character was just as interesting for his vices as he was for his talent at solving crimes.  Sherlock, used drugs inbetween cases and was very \\"unusual\\" in terms of a leading character.  Its nice to see this movie get the character right for once, instead of the image many have a quiet reflective man with a funny hat and pipe.  The only complaint is that I feel Jude Law was a poor choice for the character of Watson.  However the gritty style of the film and the character's are more than worth a watch...you simply can't come into the movie expecting a Sherlock character that Hollywood gave us in the 20th century.  Instead you should expect the Sherlock of the 19th Century...he's much more interesting to watch.
B003405MF6|5.0|Over the course if his brilliant career, Jeff Beck has recorded his share of profoundly gorgeous ballads and meditations---the stunning ability to literally sing with his guitar.     On previous albums, these performances (stunning as they have always been) were interludes; brief, tantalizing moments of contrast to harder, more aggressive sounds.     Here finally is an album that showcases, front and center, this other side of Beck. This is not a rock guitar god shredding and guitar flashing, but a mature master of wide ranging musical knowledge, offering up the full range of his musicality and taste, with perfect touch on every track. The iconoclastic nature of Beck is this album's biggest asset.    You will experience Jeff Beck \\"singing\\" an opera aria on his guitar;  stretching out on beautiful pastoral works such as \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" and \\"Elegy for Dunkirk\\", backed by an orchestra; paying a solo tribute to Judy Garland on \\"Over the Rainbow\\". You will hear his unique guitar work partnering perfectly with vocals by Imelda May and Joss Stone. As for the badass side of Beck, that's here, too on the churning instrumental \\"Hammerhead\\".    One can make a strong case that \\"Emotion and Commotion\\" is Jeff Beck's best, most fully realized album ever, certainly the most approachable and completely satisfying. It should appeal greatly to both longtime fans as well as those new to Beck.
B0037W68F4|5.0|The members of MGMT have really outdone themselves, too bad there are still some people who can't recognize this. For the people who consider \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" to only be \\"Kids\\", \\"Electric Feel\\", and \\"Time to Pretend\\" this album may come as a disappointment (sorry no breakaway singles here). However, as an album overall \\"Congratulations\\" is much more rewarding the more you listen than \\"Oracular\\", it may be a musical sprawl but it ties together much more nicely.
B000A145BE|5.0|Saturday afternoons were made for great adventure yarns, and serials dating all the way back to the silent era played upon our love of a rousing good jungle story, filled with danger and the thrill of discovery, with just enough romance thrown in to suggest love sprung from such exciting endeavors. RKO would make the most supreme adventure of all time and in 1933 change the expectations of moviegoers forevermore once the lights dimmed and their logo adorned screens across America. A new bar for adventure was set, and the film which raised it was King Kong. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Shoedsack helmed this fabulous RKO film from an idea by Cooper and Edgar Wallace.<br /><br />King Kong was much more than a girl screaming as a huge ape held her in his palm, just as Fay Wray was much more than a \\"B\\" icon with one great sound film to her credit. She had graced many silent productions, including Coast Patrol, Street of Sin, The Wedding March, and Paramount's last silent, The Four Feathers, where she worked with Merian C. Cooper. She made an easy transition to sound, her lovely presence and vulnerability boosting many early talkies from average to worth watching. Her importance to the success of King Kong is often not given its full due due to the staggering technical achievements behind the camera, often overshadowing everything else. Wray is simply wonderful at the beginning of King Kong, making viewers fall in love with her Ann Darrow long before Kong appears. If this was only an extraordinarily polished jungle adventure, it would be a film classic simply on the basis of Wray's performance and a timeless 1930's sense of style and adventure. With the added element of King Kong, a fearsome beast protective of something too beautiful to allow harm to come to it, it became one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Robert Armstrong is Carl Denham, a filmmaker known for his exciting tales of adventure. A ship bound for a mysterious location only known to Denham to make a film needs only a bit of romance to satisfy the studio. Finding the lovely Ann Darrow about to pass out from hunger during the depression is a stroke of luck for the brash director. Ann is suspicious of Denham's proposal at first, but hunger and his enthusiasm, and his assurance that there are no strings attached, give Ann hope that her luck has changed. Fay Wray is wonderful in these early moments, which often get forgotten amidst the thrilling adventure encountered in the later half of the story. She endears herself to the audience early on and cements our affection for Ann once onboard. Bruce Cabot is excellent as John Driscoll, weary of having a woman onboard but soon falling in love with Anne just as viewers have. Their romance is sweet, filled with the innocent love of the era that has a timeless appeal.<br /><br />It has been breezy fun for the viewer until the ship is west of Sumatra. Denham reveals a map he has obtained in Singapore pinpointing an uncharted island where legends of a high wall and a beast called Kong are said to exist. As they approach Skull Island adventurous fun gives way to fog shrouded waters and jungle drums. The high wall does indeed exist, and after a scrape with natives enamored of Ann they find themselves confronted by a world untouched by time. Great beasts from prehistoric times roam the jungles of the island, Kong the most fearsome of all, ruling his kingdom from a high cliff where he will take Ann. Harrowing action and thrills ensue as Jack tracks his love after Kong disposes of everyone else but Carl to protect his lovely prize. The special effects still offer excitement but it is the story which makes this film such a classic. We are rooting for Jack to rescue Ann just as in the best serials, only this is no serial, but rather a topflight production creating an astounding adventure heretofore unseen in theatres.<br /><br />A gripping escape over a cliff edge will lead to Kong's demise when he follows Ann and is capturedby Carl. Billed as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the flash of cameras perceived by Kong as an attack on his Ann creates chaos in the streets when he breaks free, leading to perhaps the most famous ending in film history. High above the New York skyline, atop the Empire State Building, Ann will find herself in the arms of the man who loves her when Kong faces down dangers he never had in the jungle. It is both romantic and bittersweet. Max Steiner's score, a screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose which perfectly balances romance and adventure, and sterling photography from Eddie Linden, Veronica Walker, and J.C. Taylor make this a memorable experience. The Nostalgia Merchant print here is one of the many I've owned over the years and is very good. If you have a combo player it is an inexpensive way to pick up a true screen classic.<br /><br />Though Fay Wray is terrific in this film, it is a shame that many viewers only know her from King Kong. Born in Canada but raised in the United States, she was a big supporter of events held at the Empire State Building over her lifetime, and after her passing, the lights of that landmark were dimmed for fifteen minutes in her memory. King Kong is perfect viewing for a Saturday morning and if you haven't seen it in awhile, or perhaps never seen it, it is much more than you might have imagined. A lovely way to remember Fay Wray.Wonder of the World, the flash of cameras perceived by Kong as an attack on his Ann creates chaos in the streets when he breaks free, leading to perhaps the most famous ending in film history.

B003ELNV9Y|4.0|At first when I saw the title of some of the songs I said here we go again, they've reigned in Jeff Beck just like they did Willie Nelson. Nessun Dorma and Cry Me a River have been done with everyone from the classical and pop side, and Jeff Beck is performing it. When will it end? But I was pleasantly surprised, some of the songs have great guitar hooks, and the voices together with Jeff's riffs make an overall great album. Still, I give it 4 stars instead of five simply because of the two songs I mention above.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This is the first and only movie that Tom Cruise has made where he actually showed acting talent. In all of his other attempts, he substitutes anger and screaming with no shading or signs he's had any training or directing whatsoever. Too bad he didn't learn how he did it. All three Mission Impossibles were embarrassing. Tom, (SUPERHERO) had to play ALL the original team rolled into one character. Teamwork MADE MI on TV. Sorry he didn't take time to research the original plot. I can give him four stars out of four for \\"Collateral\\"...and one out of four for his remaining resume credits.
B002ZG983M|5.0|This is a movie you will probably want to see again and again. Hit Girl is great. The only problem I have with the movie is they let one bad guy get away. It's hard to believe Hit Girl would ever do that. Maybe they want a sequel though. That would good.
B0037AGASG|4.0|Decided to write a review after reading a lot of negative reviews on this kid.  I don't quite understand why people hate him so much.  He's a harmless 16 year old that sings about puppy love and dances.  To say that this kid has \\"no talent\\" is just plain ridiculous.  He isn't the best singer in the world but he's got musical talent and I do think that he can sing.  He's self-taught on the guitar and drums so that's gotta count for something.  A lot of people use the excuse that he uses auto-tune which means he can't sing.  Now for me, I really don't care for auto-tune but I've come to except it, it seems to be the fad these days.  A lot of popular artists are using it i.e. Mariah Carey, Justin Timberlake, ect.  I give Bieber credit because he actually sings live unlike some performers.  As far as the album goes most of the tracks are very catchy.  It's a pop album with a hint of R&B on some tracks.   I do have to admit that some of the lyrics can be very repetitive like in the song \\"baby.\\"  On his appearance, yes does look and sound younger then a 16 year old boy, but he's just a late bloomer, that's completely out of his control.  And he really doesn't sound like a girl, that's just a mean comment that people like to say.      So in the end, I say keep an open mind and take a listen to the album.  You might be pleasantly surprised.  Like I said before it's a pop album, so if you don't like pop you are not going to like this album.  There will always be haters, that's life.  Justin is a talented kid that has room to grow.  The real test will be when he releases he's next album, which will probably be in a couple years, and he'll be 18.  It will be nice to see how he matures vocally and lyrically.
1594488843|3.0|Author Daniel Pink attempts to close the gap between what science knows and what business does in his latest book Drive. Pink proposes that societies are analogous to computer operating systems and the Motivation 2.0 is in need of an upgrade (Motivation 1.0 was our ancestral drive for hunger, thirst, sex, aka Drive Reduction Theory as discovered by psychologist Clark Hull in the 1940s). He expounds on this metaphor and incompatibility throughout the book. For example, the \\"bugs\\" in our current motivation 2.0 are the \\"If then\\" rewards, e.g, If you complete this task then you get a reward. Most of us would refer to them as the proverbial carrot and stick.<br /><br />Pink reframes and relabels the classic Type A & B behavior and suggests we look further down the alphabet to new Types I (Intrinsic motivation) & X (Extrinsic Motivation)... Not necessarily new concepts, but new letters...<br />Drive as a concept dates back to Freud (Eros & Thanatos) and perhaps earlier, and Pink's Drive is replete with studies to back up this concept of what really motivates us.  He also spends a fair amount of time discussing Mih&aacute;ly Cs&iacute;kszentmih&aacute;lyi's [[ASIN:0061339202 Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (P.S.)]], which makes sense since flow is about focused motivation and we all need to focus at this point in our distractive history ( I would refer to this as Emotional Adware--you heard it here first)---  I was glad that Pink steered away from Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  If he had expounded on that, I would have been demotivated (It is a tired reference in many business books).<br /><br />I do agree with Pink that the business world is changing and in desperate need of an upgrade since many employees are now dealing with less pay and less opportunity in this current economic climate, and the companies that nurture autonomy will thrive in the new economy. One cannot deny that humans, by their very nature, seek purpose and I personally agree with Pink that our default setting is autonomy--I know mine is.<br />In the final analysis however, Drive as motivation is internal and complex and the gap will remain open for many. You are the programmer in your personal operating system.<br /><br />If you decide to reboot or debug you personal \\"Drive\\" then Pink may offer you some insight. Maybe your system has just crashed altogether and it is time for a whole new motherboard (or personal change). It certainly gives new meaning to \\"I'm a Mac!\\" and \\"I'm a PC!\\" to take the computer metaphor a step further. We are all individuals that cannot be circumscribed by a concept, our code is more complex.<br /><br />In final computer jargon, this would be called \\"redundant code\\" (aka duplicate code),<br />and Drive still needs further analysis--a concept to build on, but not the definitive word. This is a Beta Version.ur default setting is autonomy--I know mine is.<br />In the final analysis however, Drive as motivation is internal and complex and the gap will remain open for many.

I would even give it 2 stars if the CGI effects were realistic, but they are not. Very cartoonish. Maybe 10 year olds will be riveted, but even when I was 10 I was watching smarter and more enjoyable movies than this. And Danny Glover as the President of the US?? LOL! He looked half baked though the whole movie. Not very presidential.  What a disappointment! T.C.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|Warning: Spartacus-Blood and Sand should not be viewed by women, children, men who are in touch with their feminine side, church goers, your mother, liberals, conservatives, wine connoisseurs, day care employees, Al Gore, wedding planners, and professional figure skaters.<br /><br />Non of the above apply to you?  Read on good sir, because you are a man.  A real man!  The kind of man who likes violence, sex, violent sex, blood, guts, sweat, dirt, crotch scratching, belching, beer, naked women, testosterone, and more violence..... followed by more sex and naked women.  So congratulations; you've just found the greatest show in the history of television.  Maybe the best that ever will be, because I can't comprehend the existence of a show that would be more kick ass than Spartacus.  Just thinking about what qualities a show would have to possess to make it better than Spartacus makes my brain hurt.  And if Spartacus teaches us one thing, it's that men are not supposed to think until their brains hurt.  They are supposed to think just long enough to figure out how to cut someone's bowels out of their stomachs with one swipe from a sword.  Then they're supposed to have sex with a submissive, naked woman.  Or women.  And then they eat.<br /><br />I'm not going to take the time to write out a synopsis for the show ( I really shouldn't even be using the word \\"synopsis\\" in a sentence) nor am I going to give you a history lesson about the real Spartacus.  I am going to sum up Spartacus-Blood and Sand and simultaneously tell you why you should watch it using only simple words and phrases.  Blood.  Violence.  Sex.  Nudity.  Foul language.  Sweating.  Training.  Swords.  Murder.  Blonds.  Brunettes.  Red-heads.  Breasts.  Spitting.  Breaking stuff.  Gladiators.  Cheering crowds.  Fighting.  Are you still reading?  Why?  Go watch it already!<br /><br />In all fairness, Spartacus does borrow heavily in style from the movie 300.  So it that a bad thing?  What, you didn't like 300 sissy man?  Fine.  Go watch The Bridges of Madison County again and find someone to talk about your feelings with.  But for all the rest of you real men who loved 300 for all the right reasons, you'll love Spartacus just as much.  You'll watch it and soon find yourself walking down your street in nothing but boots and a loin cloth, carrying a sword, vowing to destroy all who dare challenge you.  Stupid punk kid across the street?  Smash his car!  Annoying neighbor?  Have sex with his wife!  Old women down the street bothering you about your yard maintenance?  Throw a brick through her window!  YOU.  ARE.  A.  MAN!<br /><br />So in summary:  Manliness = watch Spartacus-Blood and Sand.  Sissyness = do anything else.watch The Bridges of Madison County again and find someone to talk about your feelings with.

B001U0HBPG|4.0|This film lasts almost 3 hours, and the premise is neither plausible nor well justified.  Nonetheless it is fast-paced, entertaining and emotionally and intellectually stimulating, and it kept my complete attention throughout.  Capable of provoking both laughter and tears, but a heavy movie with more sadness than joy.  Not recommended as a feel-good movie, but recommended as a thought-provoking entertainment and/or stimulator of conversation.  If you liked Forrest Gump and The Notebook, you'll like this film, and Brad Pitt is great in it!

B000XUBC5E|2.0|I typiclly like Harlen Coben's work, but this one was a definate miss. This book was convoluted and confusing.  There were a lot of extraneous characters & subplots that served no purpose at all.  The level of detail of random thoughts and locations made the reading of the book even more excrutiating.
B0037W68F4|4.0|It's common knowledge that the second album can make or break a band. The great ones (think Zeppelin II or Radiohead's The Bends) beat the odds and deliver the second time around. Unfortunately, this is not the norm (now think of The Second Dumping, I mean Coming by Stone Roses or the second or third CD's by the downwardly spiraling Strokes.) MGMT fans can now exhale: their second disc is different and strange but better than the debut.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I prefer the sixties/psychedelic/indie sound of Congratulations to the wall of sound eighties dance drone of their spectacular debut. It doesn't take more than the initial few seconds of \\"It's Working\\" to hear that partners Vanwyngarden and Goldwasser are going to do it their way. And by their way, I don't mean Sinatra. Try Pink Floyd/Syd Barrett era mixed with a hint of nineties Elephant 6 and just a dash of modern bands like Islands and Arcade Fire. It's got just enough spunk and spirit to reject the retro label.<br /><br />There are a couple of (almost) traditional song structures (Someones Missing, Congratulations.) Those are the exceptions. God bless the boys for mixing things up and making an album that wouldn't be out of place in the sixties, nineties or now. How soon is now: the time it takes you to download this album (Lady Da Da you can skip) and recognize that The Arcade Fire are not the lone kingpins of modern music.
0393072231|4.0|I have read maybe a dozen books on the crisis so far and I consider this one of the best (with my favorite still being Charles Morris' Trillion Dollar Meltdown). Unlike Andrew Ross Sorkin, Lewis does not cop-out by calling the whole mess a \\"perfect storm.\\"  He does not suggest that no one was accountable.  Instead he shows us how the crisis was not a confluence of unpredictable forces, that it was caused by many systemic failures that smart people in many areas detected early on.  Lewis states that credit rating agencies failed to look at the actual quality of the debt in CDOs.  Some others fail to consider the important of those triple A ratings to this disaster (as seen in Mark Zandi's book).   Lewis makes good points in questioning the role of inappropriate financial rewards that left the most unsuccessful trader with tens of millions in unquestioned bonuses.  I also liked his criticism of the models that were relied upon, with a major flaw being that correlation risk would not rocket to 100% in the event of a national crisis.  He also notes the stunning failure of internal risk management controls at so many companies (like AIG's failure to understand the true sub-prime content of the CDS deals that the insurer was underwriting).    When Lewis states that the problem with Lehman Brothers was not that it was allowed to fail (as most people think today) but rather why is was allowed to succeed, he is showing the courage and insight that has become too rare in our current revisionist, self-appeasing culture. Lewis helps us understand some of the most important questions we should be asking.  As the recent 2,200 page federal report shows, Lehman did a lot of questionable and possibly even criminal things to make its quarterly reports mask the company's true leverage ratios.     Late in the book, Lewis raises some interesting concerns that are not fully developed.  For example he questions whether the change from private partnership status to publicly traded corporations caused the major investment banks to assume more risk and gamble with leverage ratios (some four to five times what was once considered normal).  I see that at least one critic on this site has called this point \\"absurd.\\" I strongly disagree.  Lewis is not at all absurd to question this area.  In fact the \\"agency relationship\\" that exists between shareholders as the owners and the board and management as the hired fiduciary managers is well known, and the implicit moral hazard risks are fundamental concerns to this structure.   It is important, for example, to note that Hank Greenberg owned or controlled about 30% of the stock when I worked at AIG.  He treated every cent as if it were his own money and he created a culture that made everyone think the same way.  At other insurers where I have worked senior management has had almost no personal skin in the game, and their results show what can happen when medicroity and abject failure is rewarded with huge bonuses and regal lifestyles.     So Lewis is right to raise this point but I am surprised that he does not focus much at all on the failure of Christopher Cox and the SEC to regulate these publicly-traded companies.  The road to hell is paved with regulators who do not believe in regulation.  Clearly, this could have been a 500 page book if Lewis wanted to explore every important avenue.  But as it is, this is a great, insightful read with several masterful metaphors that make the most arcane issues more understandable (like comparing the subprime problem to a huge helium balloon that all the most respected minds in Wall Street were originally desperately trying to hold on to).     If the absence of an index is not a major problem to you and you are interested in knowing more about the people who made the bets against market (and the price they paid through it all), I strongly recommend this book!
0896898288|2.0|The book review says \\"everything you need to create.....quilt.\\"  Well, that's not true.  The book itself does not contain any patterns.  If you just want to read the stories it's very nice.  If you want to quilt--things are lacking.  In addition to the book you'll need a computer and lots of paper.  For quilters who don't have or use computers, having to have the patterns printed for them at a copy store will add perhaps $l0 to $15 to the cost of the book.  Some 100+ pages of patterns. As other reviewers have noted that's excessive.  One little pattern piece per page.  In addition, I didn't catch in the reviews that there are errors in the book.  It's necessary to go to the book's website and find a list of errors and their corrections.  I've done a lot of sampler quilts and most of those patterns have written and printed pattern instructions on 8 pages or so. Nice stories--otherwise big disappointment, inconvenient, and added expense to create a quilt.
0525421580|4.0|Will Grayson has two simple rules: Don't care too much and shut up. Which is easy to remember, when his best friend Tiny Cooper is constantly breaking these rules. Tiny Cooper also seems to fall in love once an hour and never stops talking. Will just seems to follow the motions of life. He just seems to follow Tiny's wake, which includes being the only straight guy in the school's Gay Straight Alliance. The other will grayson(Refered to WG for the rest of the review) hates his friends and is shut off from everyone, but his Internet boyfriend, Issac. Then one winter night, WG decides to go to Chicago to meet Issac. That same night, Will Grayson and Tiny Cooper are there for a music show. The Will Graysons meet at one random street corner and their worlds quickly intertwine as they get ready for romance and the history's most awesome musical ever made.<br />Will Grayson was like every other John Green character. He is a bit nerdy, yet average. Suddenly he catches attention of some gorgeous girl that he didn't know until recently. I am not saying that the character is bad, but it is rather redundant. I still found his perspective to be interesting. I love Tiny Cooper. Seriously, I wish he was my best friend. I also loved Jane. She had a lot of style and was fun. WG was depressing at times, but I think that was just teenage angst. I found the characters to all be very funny and I laughed a lot during the book. The plot was slow at times, but I felt that it gradually built up. The musical was amazing and it needs to happen in real life. Other then the fact that John Green's characters were similar, I didn't find that much unoriginality. John Green is a skilled writer. His style was rather normal, while David Levithan's style had no capitalization or structure. I liked how the style bounced off of one another and created such a great story. I found Will Grayson, Will Grayson to be a funny story about growing up and finding who you are. I think you would enjoy this book, if you liked any of John Green or David Levithan's past book.ou liked any of John Green or David Levithan's past book.

0471463396|1.0|This book is worthless and the math is someimes wrong. The author wants you to go through the statements and find the EPV. He believes that WD40 company is a good bet. In one case he goes through many calculations only to find that it was not necessary. Net income is not a good number to use to calculate value. Buy Sham Gad's book about value investing; he knows that it is cash flow that determines value, and you can use this to calculate intrinsic value.

0316044695|5.0|I read this book in under 24 hours, it is that interesting I did not want to put it down.  I found myself looking for excuses to take a break and read for another ten minutes.<br /><br />I have read a number of books on the SEAL teams.  All were pretty interesting, but this book is different because I remember the news accounts of this ordeal when it happened.  Most of the other books talk about BUDS/S training, which is incredibly interesting to me, I love reading about people that have pushed the envelope in mental and physical endurance.  The other books talk about missions that I never heard of, but I knew about operation Redwing.<br /><br />The book kept my interest the whole way through.  I believe this will make a great movie, and hope to see it in a theater one day.<br /><br />Ps: Yes, Marcus has an opinion that leans towards the right.  Yes, he speaks his opinion of how the media can try a war hero in the court of public opinion and make him a traitor.<br /><br />I find it a little weird that there are more than a few negative comments towards this great story based on the fact that some people did not like his comments.  Some of them almost seem to border on violent.  Why would anyone get that upset about someone else's opinion?  Isn't that one of the reasons all wars are fought?  Because someone in power does not like someone else's opinion about something?<br /><br />Lighten up people, its his book, he gets to give his opinion and it in no way takes away from this excellent story.<br /><br />Thank you Marcus Luttrell for your excellent story and for your service and dedication.  I appreciate what you guys do.<br /><br />There are two other books that do a great job covering the making of a SEAL which I highly recommend, [[ASIN:1400046955 The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228]] and [[ASIN:0609810464 The Finishing School: Earning the Navy SEAL Trident]]

B002ZJGN96|5.0|This soundtrack is more than just an aural accompaniment to the wonderful movie, this stands alone as a work of ethereal beauty and haunting power. What truly sets the Avatar soundtrack apart for me are the Na'vi vocals. Both elegant, alluring and powerful, they are a unique addition to the swelling classical and brass sections which are most effectively used in the tracks \\"Climbing Up Iknimaya\\" and \\"Jake's First Flight.\\"    These are soaring masterpieces of sound which will leave you breathless, and, if you've seen the movie, probably in tears. Every chord, every beat and breath of these tracks swells with life and emotion, and will take you the same emotional roller coaster you were put on in the theaters. I admit to openly weeping (again) during \\"The Destruction of Hometree,\\" which is carefully tuned aurally to speak the action to you in sound. You can see in your mind every missile fired, every ikran rider escaping, every moment of that mighty tree smashing to the ground. In \\"War\\" you can feel the power as thousands of ikran obliterate the mercenary ships and crush their power armor.    If you're thinking this is \\"just another movie soundtrack,\\" think twice. I would rank this as James Horner's all-time great tracks, maybe the best. And the greatest thing about it: you can't stop listening to it. You can hear it every day and find something else in your life to connect the music with. Call it a soundtrack for your own life, it certainly is for mine.    ~Dan
B00002SSKI|1.0|This movie is horrible all over. It is compared to \\"Stand By Me\\". That movie is a classic. This one does not even come close to measuring up to SBM.<br />Some say this is an inspirational movie for young girls. Just so you know, they are wrong! If you're a parent do not show this to your child. It promotes sexism in the worst ways. The girls a children are all persecuted by boys. Practically every word out of these boys' mouths is sexist. That is not how real boys behave at all.  This is a movie that seems to be designed to make girls, from a young age, distrust and be hard on the male gender and see them as nothing but knuckle-dragging neanderthals who all think they are superior to the female gender even though the are REALLY just dumb morons.  \\"You can't...you're a girl\\".  \\"You're good...but only for a girl!\\"  This is taken to the absolute extreme. This is not like real life at all. Every interaction with the boys these girls have they act as if they are being attacked. In response they proceed to become violent physically, verbally, and by their actions. They do horrible things like stealing the boys' clothes while they are skinny dipping, and spying on them to see their p#&is'. Punching and attacking a fat boy, who admittedly was being a jerk, but in real life wouldn't have acted quite that sexist. In the present timeline when the girls are grown one of them is pregnant.  And they blame it on men in general.  Sound like a movie that sets a good example? I think not!  This is a horrible movie and a bad influence. 0/10. Do not watch it.

1594132666|4.0|This book was read and reviewed by the Daughters of Magdala at my parish.  It was a very good choice and received well. Elizabeth Gilbert is a very gifted, whitty author who is capable of great humor and compassion, as she pulls you in on her dealings and experiences in her struggle to find God and Who she is.   Reading this book is an adventure---even if one does not agree with all that she learns and experiences--it is exciting and moving.    I have purchased the sequel to this book--Committed--and am anxious to continue her life's experiences.

193413712X|3.0|It goes without saying that any review is a subjective opinion. It's a -potentially- qualified observation as filtered through the person's experiences and biases. Precision and accuracy aren't exactly guaranteed aspects of the process.    Yes, there are guidelines of sorts...but even these lack any surety.    Which is why divergent opinions are common.    'Tinkers' is a novel that certainly sets itself up to be divergent. If you read the blurbs on the back cover, the consensus is that it's no wonder at all that Paul Harding won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for this début. Unfortunately, I can't be part of that consensus...even though I can appreciate what he produced here: great writing (within its intent) yet not a 'great novel'.    For me, a 'great novel' provides an exemplary reading experience. Encompassing notions such as being 'transportive'. 'Illuminating'. 'Thought-provoking', 'elegiacal', 'moving', 'inspiring'...but most of all, 'entertaining'.    'Tinkers', on the whole, was not 'entertaining'. Nor was it, but for rare instances, hardly any of the other descriptives I've provided. (Let me say that Mr. Harding's talents shone best -for me, I'm just saying for me- when he was less purposefully artsy-fartsy and more direct. Less with the 'ephemeral', more being 'genuine'. Indeed, when the author is efficiently direct...especially in a storytelling vein...and not obtuse, when he doesn't faff about, weaving lofty thoughts in the air, the tale shines so much more brightly. Best example of this? The final thirty-or-so pages.)    It is a fine piece of work. Distinct, original...mindful of Life.    But as much as it possesses these attributes, it's also murky, disjointed and a challenge to grasp. I feel the need to make it clear here that I am not a pedestrian reader. I appreciate a challenge, and love it when a writer has the ability to get us to use our mental muscles, tendons and ligaments. But for me, Mr. Harding does not actually accomplish this. Rather, I felt handicapped, burdened by the way he did what he -so capably- did.    Worse, 'Tinkers' regularly brought a particular word to mind, and it's not a nice one when attached to a creative endeavour: 'precious'.    I didn't see the value of ever-shifting tenses and perspectives. (This story is at its core, the near-death ruminations of a man. So from this storyteller's point-of-view, there really only needs to be one of these. Points-of-view. Period.) At the same time, I didn't have a problem with a non-linear approach; the 'here, then there, then over there' style seemed appropriate to the main character's state, so that wasn't an issue. What was an issue, and is always an issue for me when writers insist on it, is the decidedly annoying practice of not using any punctuation where dialogue is concerned. It is perhaps the worst of writerly affectations, and I confess, I have little tolerance for it; totally and entirely unnecessary.    I don't fault Mr. Harding for having written his novel in the way that he did., with being economical and esoteric in mind. In fact, I'm envious of him having done so...and having garnered so illustrious an award as a result. But I do fault critics, reviewers and other writers for being so insistent that those of us for whom 'Tinkers' was not as fulfilling an experience as it was for them, are somehow lacking in some intellectual capacity. Left wanting for brain matter, I suppose.    Because in the end, just as with food, assessing works of fiction is an exercise in subjectivity. (Perhaps, if you will, 'informed subjectivity'.) So those of us who get their greatest enjoyment out of a traditional 'Sunday roast', two different types of meat, a half-dozen vegetables, Yorkshire Pudding, fresh-baked rolls, a nice accompanying wine, a healthy chunk apple cobbler with ice cream for dessert capped by just-brewed coffee should not be derided for being either unwilling or incapable of raising a cheer for a dainty gastronomic repast, a cordon-bleu's multi-course dazzlement, no matter how wonderfully fashioned, no matter how stunning the execution and presentation.    For me, 'Tinkers' would have better pleased me had it been created more with the feast in mind...though I do appreciate that the author accomplished something quite admirable in the economical finger-food he served us. My appetite deserved something more substantive.    In fact, at the risk of entirely enraging those-who-see-this-novel-as-reverently-as-they-do, I'll say this: I'd have much preferred it had it been written as robustly and in a more thorough way (so as to more fittingly honour its characters) as to resemble in presentation 'The Story of Edgar Sawtelle'.    Personal rating: 7/10.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|4/18/2010 - 4/25/2010 Best/Buy com has this movie for $22.99 for the Blu-Ray and the regular DVD for $15.99!!!!!!!
B00383ZTXO|5.0|A great job on disc #1, but the buy this again every few years game has completely turned me off, so I am giving this 5 stars for the money well spent on the second disc.   To me, the roll that started with the you don't want my name box is now a full blown rampage. I could listen to this (live) stuff all day.   If you enjoyed the \\"you\\" box, get this! Getting old has it's privileges!
B002PEP4U0|5.0|What a wonderful and inspiring book. You constantly root for William, his family, and community. What a genius. fighter. and exceptional human being. There was no room for negativism or defeat in William's life, &#34;Just do it!&#34;
B000UZNRS2|2.0|If it wasn't for the plot, I'd rate this 1 star.  The writing is elementary at best and the style is very generic.  Many lines and descriptions are very cheesy and a little bigoted at times.
B001EN1R2M|5.0|If you were a fan of 80's music, you remember all the hair bands that came out, and they all sounded the same. The lead singer was polished, the guitars sharp and \\"shiny\\", and lots of compression. In the sea of all those albums, \\"Too Fast For Love\\" came out in 1985, and when you put the record on your turntable, the music didn't just sound good...it grabs your ears and demands you listen to it. Forget all the other albums Crue put out after this, which are good....but the first album should be a textbook on how a debut album should sound. The band sounded so HUNGRY...very stripped down, a bare \\"bollocks\\" to the wall, \\"the rent is due on Friday and please buy our album so we can eat\\" sounding album. I have listened to so many cd's, albums, live bands, and none have come close to \\"Too Fast For Love\\" for it's intensity. It's too bad they never sounded this good, this raw, after this album. Each track just \\"burns\\".... This CD should be a must listen for any class on Early 1980's L.A. metal bands.
B0018LMZOE|4.0|I dont get it!!! Why are the Moody Blues not inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame? I listen to an album as good as this one and i cant figure it out. They will put Madonna and ABBA in there but not this group!!! Anyway...this album has always been a classic right down to its cover art and the great song \\"The story in your eyes\\" (which is included here with two versions...one is an alternate bonus track). If you are listening to this re-mastered version on a really good stereo system you can hear the flutes of Ray Thomas...Justin Haywards guitars..John Lodges bass and the great keyboard work of Mike Pinder and of course the drums of Graham Edge and those magnificent vocals, swirling around you in the terrific mix that has been done on these fantastic remastered editions. My own favorites would have to be the progression of songs from \\"One more time to live\\" starting at track 6 right on thru \\"My Song\\" at track 9 which finishes this great work.However...stick around because you will then be treated to 2 bonus tracks which have been added. There is an alternate version, as mentioned before,of \\"Story in your eyes\\" (which i happen to like better than the released version) and an unheard track called \\"The Dreamer\\" which is certainly worth a listen. Even though their best work is behind them now...when you have made albums as good as this one it is something to be proud of. Add this one to your list of Moodie Blues \\"remasters\\" worth picking up. Now...about that question regarding the rock and roll hall of fame......
B001KR0BDI|5.0|I did love this book but it takes a little while to get into it. In this book Katsa is graced with.... killing. In her land gracelings like Katsa are shunned hated abused and taken advantage of. They are distinguished by their eyes each a different color. Katsa's uncle uses Katsa to torture people who tick him off. But instead off going on her usual thug missions Katsa will instead help people instead of kill them. This is how she meets Po a leinid prince. Katsa decides to go with Po to uncover secrets about a mysterious king with a mysterious grace. This thrilling book is filled with betrayal hatred fierce passion and unexpected romance. It may take a while to get into but it's worth it! I definately recomend this book.
B00275EGWY|3.0|I do not know a lot about the military, but I do know enough to realize that this movie was greatly dramatized for \\"effect\\". The flaws were numerous....a three-man unit like the one portrayed would not just go out on its own without backup, which this team did many times. EOD people are not rogues! The search of the dark alleys was just ridiculous and unbelievable...they had night-vision equipment on their helmets but they were shining flashlights down a long dark alley??? And why wouldn't a car engulfed in flames blow up, along with the bombs in its trunk???<br /><br />It seemed that they never had to answer to any superiors either. No accountability. What the main character, Will, did would never have been tolerated in real life.<br /><br />I also know, from reading I have done, that disarming a bomb is a last resort....first they would blow it up.<br /><br />I cannot imagine many EOD people being happy with this movie.The blatant disregard for rules and regulations shown in this movie must really tick them off!<br /><br />Why wasn't the script more accurate when so much correct info is out there? A modicum of accuracy would not have been difficult to achieve with little effort, it seems. I know this is a movie and is \\"made up\\" but when a movie claims to depict reality, it should do so. Viewers can only suspend belief so much.<br /><br />I felt like I was watching a documentary, just one bomb disposal scene after another. No real character development or plot. Just a string of intense situations, some of which are never fully fleshed-out.....like....why was Ralph Fiennes out in the desert with four other men? That was never explained that I could tell. And why would an EOD unit be left out in the desert for so long? Seems to me they would have requested helicopter assistance.<br /><br />The best things I can say about this movie is that I learned about the various kinds of bombs that are being fashioned in Iraq and that the movie did not try to make a political statement.
B002I9Z8B2|4.0|Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan on a HD TV... wow!!     It brings back memories of sitting in the movie complex watching this on the big screen. It was excellent movie... great script of revenge.     Paramount don't remake this movie with the new crew.    Additionally, if Paramount is reading this review... this is the kind of movie which makes it great. Paramount should be ashamed of an eposide from TNG from the first season where the parasites enter into the body. You never continued that eposide or expanded on it. Shame!
B0017HEX76|5.0|Love Fantasia, after seeing it a zillion times in English, the Korean version is quite unique! It starts in Korean, and the menu is in Korean as well.  Here's how to change it to English - go to the pop-up menu, select the third option, and then select the fourth option from that screen, and press play.  That's English with English subtitles.
0393072231|5.0|The Big Short is one of the best works regarding the recent market crash that I have read.  Having worked in the institutional finance area for several years now, I was able to witness firsthand many of the issues that are uncovered in this book.  You see, people only know as much as they are paid to know.  Those who ask the hard questions are always labeled trouble makers.  Large corporations cannot function if there is too much dissent among the rank. This is a necessary evil considering their business models.  The largest financial institutions return obscene and undue rewards on those who are best suited to work within their business models.  As is often the case, management in these large financial was often unaware what the layer beneath them truly worked on.  The author of The Big Short goes into this, of course... but he focuses less on the failures of management, and more on a small group of people who simply asked \\"Why?\\"<br /><br />As the author puts it, the people who ask why are the pessimists.  They stood in direct competition with the optimist. The optimists were the ones who moved up the ranks quickly.  They always had good things to pass on to their superiors.  That was rewarded with more short term gains, which only made the lot even more optimistic.  Of course, it didn't matter if reality stood in the way of what they were saying.  Unfortunately... reality is always reality.<br /><br />Vi veri universum vivus vici.... By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe.  And that is exactly what the protagonists of the book have done.  A handful of people used the truth to sift through the web of lies Wall Street had created.  Starting in the 1970's, a new gaming system had been created.  These gentlemen saw the fraud and abuse.  At first, a few had spoken out about the system... only to find that there are no rewards for this.  Considering that the optimists were the ones making obscene profit from the abuse, there was no reason to listen to the warnings.<br /><br />Follow this logic.  You are smart enough to understand how and why a CDO works.  You understand the concept of a CDS.  And you know that the SEC doesn't regulate the bond market in the same way they do in the equity market.  With that in mind, it would be a reasonable assumption to realize that you are in an extreme minority.  Smart enough to understand the system and smart enough to know how to profit from the system.  Being the minority, you would have no chance of stopping or changing the system.  You are, however, in the perfect position to punish those responsible.<br /><br />And that is the true beauty of this work.  The good guys couldn't stop the collapse, but they exacted retribution.  By quietly maneuvering themselves into position, they literally brought down Wall Street.  Many of the companies involved are now defunct.  While many lost their jobs, most left with more money than any of us will see in our lives.<br /><br />This work should be a must read for anyone looking towards financial reform.  The problem people focus on is often rules and regulation.  It almost never covers culture.  People continually fail upwards.  A worker who has no clue what he is doing can often make it based on a cheery disposition alone.  I see this first hand every day at my own place of business.  Highly unqualified people with little to no understanding of the process or products are catapulted to the top.  Obvious problems are ignored rather than solved. Issues are actually covered up using more effort than it would have taken to do correctly the first time around.  Thousands of dollars are lost daily due to inefficiencies.  Sadly, the company I work for is perhaps one of the best run with the highest of ethical standards.  The others can only be worse.  This book delves into how rotten the whole system has become.<br /><br />The reason is simple.  The banks are playing with someone else's money. These traders are making $25 million ayear, why would they care that they are taking advantage of the average person in order to make a dollar. As long as there is that much incentive to game the system, everyone will lose in the long run.ing advantage of the average person in order to make a dollar.

B002UNMW7O|2.0|The Boondock Saints II had the potential to be a very good movie. I was sorely disappointed. No longer is it good vs. evil. It's about the Saints' reputation, the father's resignation to his fate, and retribution all the way around. Really.    I did love Julie Benz as Agent Eunice Bloom. Her portrayal is priceless. There are some great scenes that are classic. For instance, the \\"f-ing rope\\" comes in handy again and more falling into the scene is involved.     If you watch this movie knowing that it is not up to par with the first, perhaps you'll enjoy it more. By the way, what did Sean Patrick Flanery do to his face?!?
B0036B8MZU|5.0|This show is the best I have ever seen.  It leaves you always wanting more.  The writing is superb and the acting does it justice.  When reading the reviewers who gave it a 1 I noticed they only watched the first episode.  I will admit that they did overuse special effects and that they were not very good.  But i was glad to see that after the first episode they were pretty much gone.  Great for couple too not just men.  My girlfriend refused to watch it with me but at the 4th episode i thought it was fantastic and made her watch it.  She LOVES it now!  We cant wait for season 2.  Its frustrating to see people reviewing a 13 episode show after only watching 1.
1439153663|5.0|Ed's wife Barb writing this:   This wonderful story written by Kathleen Grissom is so touching at times, that I was brought to tears!    The Kitchen House is about two women.    There are other characters of course, but the story revolves around Lavinia and Belle.   In the year 1791, Lavinia is orphaned at the tender age of 7 while on-board a ship from Ireland. The Captain brings her home to his Southern plantation as an indentured servant, to pay off her deceased parent's debt.  She is to work, and live among the Negro kitchen slaves.   Lavinia is one scared little girl, dazed, confused, and unable to comprehend her situation, and this carries on through the story.  Belle, a young Negro woman who works in the kitchen house behind the Main Home, is given the responsibility of taking care of the child.   She is to teach Lavinia how to cook, clean, and whatever needs to be done.   She also happens to be the secret daughter of the Captain and a slave, though his family thinks she is his whore!     Speaking of secrets, there is a lot of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" going on!   That is mostly because of the interaction of slave-owners and their slaves, and the social lines that they \\"do-not cross\\"!!!  Over the years, Lavinia's \\"family\\" have become the Negro slaves that keep the Main House running smoothly.     As the story progresses on, events happen that are tragic to both sets of people - the owners of the plantation, and the slaves.   Lavinia and Belle are intertwined through their respective lives, and their stories are interwoven to make an interesting story of love and friendship through adversity.    I thoroughly enjoyed this glimpse of history of Virginia plantation life in the late 1700's and early 1800's.   I know this novel is a fictional account of life on a plantation, but I'm guessing a lot of what happened was true for that era!     An excellent read!
0061854549|5.0|As the title says. This book talks about how people not only make irrational decisions, but also that people do so in a consistent and often explainable ways (thus predictable).    Reading this book is a breeze. I basically finished my read in one go in one day (and came back afterwards and reread some chapters). Very readable and does not take much effort. Lots of anecdotes (which is what a normal person is interested in), followed by statistics. Good way to present the material.    Sections in this book have considerate overlap with the authors talks at TED and Duke. But the author makes his point very convincingly. Definitely recommanded.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie really opened my eyes to the food me and my family was eating. I have changed the meat and vegetables we eat to only organic. The way the farmers treated the animals was really heartbreaking. I wish everyone would see this movie, another thing the way they washed the meat we consume.(bleach and ammonia) I had no idea this was going on.  Buy this movie and you be your own judge.

I remember hearing \\"Broken English\\" first in 1979 on the \\"Duke of Madness\\" (Gerry Goodwin) show on WBCN in Boston while I was stationed in the USAF in New Hampshire.  Totally trippy at 1am in the morning then and still relevant today.  If you have the vinyl, convert it, man.  Ripping vinyl is for the masses.  This is a great alblum.
0307463745|5.0|Rework treads the fine line between being direct and simply stating the obvious.    The ideas are not new, the concepts not unique to these authors. It's their bold, uncategorical, and direct statements that leave you feeling as though you're hearing them for the very first time. And for many that may well be the case.    Rework is a collection of essays densely packed with points to ponder and illustrations to bring the words to life.  The authors' unique view of work will inevitably inspire new approaches to the way you work. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to break out of a rut and get different results.    Straight talk from guys who've worked differently and experienced success by any measure, Rework is a book to own.

I am sure it will be the most inspirational book you'll pick up in 2010. You'll redefine what \\"impossible\\" means into something not so very daunting after finishing The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, and that's a very fine thing to occur. If only we get to work, we all have greater resources to overcome what seems \\"impossible\\" than we dare hope for and realize.<br /><br />People who grew up in Africa have a world view that's far different than those who grew up in North America or Europe. Poor farmers often live on the knife-edge of starvation, fearful of what evil influences may be unloosed on them. As a result, an African often sees choices differently and more starkly. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind captures those cultural differences astonishingly well. I intend to recommend this book to those who want to understand how to be of more help to people in East Africa. There's also a hidden hero here, whoever decided to put a library of American technical books into Malawi for people there to use.<br /><br />William Kamkwamba will be a warm-blooded hero you'll love to cheer for. He's Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, and Tom Swift all rolled into one, but with a physics book in his hand to provide directions rather than just his natural intelligence and wit. I commend Bryan Mealer for so beautifully capturing the sweetness of William's soul while also expressing the reality of his environment. Even the descriptions of how to make power with a windmill are terrific. I learned a lot about power generation and transmission. Who knew it's all so complicated?<br /><br />I must admit to being biased towards windmills and their makers. I used them as a metaphor in one of my books for the optimal strategy. If this book had already been written, I would have based that metaphor on William's windmill.<br /><br />You'll also enjoy the rags-to-riches ending as publicity about William's windmill allows him to receive the kind of recognition and support that permit him now to pursue bigger dreams while gaining a more thorough education. It will be fun to watch him in future years.etaphor on William's windmill.

B002WY65W4|2.0|In some ways I'm reminded of how I was fleeced into seeing a certain \\"witch\\" movie of yore.  It pains me to this day how that flick, on a far smaller budget, managed to con me and countless others into forking over money based on hyped trailers filled with more substance than the film itself.  Ah, but the wheel goes round and round, and so we fast forward to today and witness it happening again. If only I hadn't listened to my \\"friends\\" and taken a chance on this cow plop. While there are some all too rare moments scattered about that bring a chuckle, for the most part its annoying weasel of a central character, his limp-wrist \\"rules', and wuss of a voice-over & mannerisms, grated on my all too tired nerves. I can put up with, to a point, weak characters, but the story simply doesn't engage you enough no matter how coy it tries to be.  And boy does it ever like to remind us how \\"clever\\" it is.  Heck! The introductory title sequence had more going for it than just about anything else. Seems the zombies got more meat to gnaw on than the audience who are left with indigestable twinkies of false hope rotting in their guts.  On a technical note for the Blu-Ray I add a star because the disc menu system and in-movie effects are quite well done and for Woody's efforts at pushing this \\"zombie-kibble\\" of a cast and non-story along.
0307408833|1.0|I am very disappointed because I really love the baked goods I purchase from the LA bakery on a regular basis, especially the chocolate chip cookie sandwiches, donuts, and tea cakes (cupcakes are usually a little dry but I think that's because they refrigerate them). So, I was thrilled about the idea of making these at home so that I would not have to sit in an hour's traffic to get to downtown LA to get my treats (horrible location by the way, west side would have been a wiser choice.) I spent a lot of time and money locating and purchasing the ingredients but in the end the outcome was horrible.    First of all, the book does not say to use \\"unscented\\" and refined coconut oil which is what you need to use to prevent the strong coconut flavor. In fact, on the BabyCakes website in the Menu > About Our Ingredients section it says they use Cold Pressed Virgin Coconut Oil. The virgin coconut oil is the one with the scent.. so this doesn't make sense. However, because of this page this is what I used. It was not until after I made my treats and they came out way too coconutty that I asked on Twitter (@babycakesbook) and they told me to use unscented. I am not sure if the FAQ page about the book was up on the site at the time because that does have the information about the unscented but I am still not sure why it conflicts with the About Our Ingredients section and why this information is not in the book itself.    I have tried making the chocolate chip cookies, frosting, and carrot cupcakes and even though I have followed the directions exactly everything has come out terribly. The cookies were super flat and dark around the edges. The frosting was inedible, not sweet at all, with a custardy texture and a floury taste. The carrot cupcakes had no sweetness at all. I had to throw everything out.    I took a look on the BabyCakes website again in the Menu > Nutritional Information section and noticed that the ingredients for many items are completely different than thosein the book. For example, here are the frosting ingredients:    FROSTING: rice starch , sunflower oil, corn starch, cold pressed coconut oil, rice milk, coconut milk, coconut flour, lemon extract, calcium carbonate (vegan) , sea salt, xanthan gum, guar gum, monoglycerides (an emulsifier), inulin, vitamins c, e, b6, a, folic acid, and vitamin b12    I feel scammed and just really upset that I was fooled into thinking I could make these delicious treats at home when it fact it is not true. I am also stuck with a bunch of expensive ingredients I can't use. I don't understand why they would think it is OK to publish a book with totally different recipes than what they use in the store ??
B00275EGWY|5.0|INTRO   NICE. Nothing about vague words like Honor or Patriotism. The men were there to do a job save lives, and they tried to do it well and go home. It nicely captured the stress from the prolonged exposure to danger and deployment! What I like though is that there was no mentioned of either the word \\"Stress\\" or \\"Duty\\", unlike other war movies. But as a package, the subtle signs are there for all to see.     I found the lead review by DarthRad, titled \\"Taut war drama exploring the psychology of soldiering\\" by fairly relevant. Hence I will only share certain aspects that I think was not answered in that review.      Q&A   Why did Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) prefer combat than family?   Probably to the man, its either you dismantle the bomb or you don't. No grey areas, unlike when it comes to family and love. He did not communicate well with the wife, though he loved her and the baby. (He tried calling her from Iraq, but don't know what to say).     Why did Sergeant James choose bomb dismantling?   Probably it gave some adrenaline. It's a job that others shun (its one of the most dangerous job) and one that he can Excel. As I have said, the show doesn't keep talking about duty (we can safely assumed its not sponsored by the Neo-Con). But there he was, performing his duty to his country, and bringing bread to his family the best way he knows how (though agreed that it's a dangerous way).     Why did Sergeant James put himself in extra risks when detonating it would do?   He understood that winning the war, is not only about bombing/killing the Iraqis. Its to show them why the US Army was better. On the IEDs, he saw that the perception of winning convincingly (in the eyes of Iraqis), is to beat them at their own games.     Its well-known that US Army got one of the best technology. Thefore, he was trying to show that US Army have the wits and balls to overcome the sneaky matters that the terrorists were using with the Iraqis. You can call him dumb in choosing this way to signal to the Iraqis. But that is what we call firm conviction and delication.     Why did Sgt. Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge (partners of Sergeant James), stood by Sergeant James dangerous antics?     They were conservative to risks, but they still protected and followed Sergeant James. This was because, they too shared Sergeant James's belief that they were there to make a difference. Like James, they too knew that firefighting daily to dismantle the bombs would not stop the bombs from coming. Its through their actions that would turn the tide of Iraqis opinions and stop the IEDs from coming.     There was also an aspect of dedication to their fellow soldiers. That partly explained why they always covered James even though they do not fully agreed with him.     The needs to get to the cause of IEDs and their dedication to their fellow soldiers cumulated when James led them to chase after the \\"phantom bombers\\" when there was an big explosion at the Greenzone, where they are called to investigate.     The fact that they may not have made sound and reasonable judgment did not mean that they are of unsounded mind. It just showed that with prolonged combat fatigue, daily tensions and fog of wars, different decisions may be chosen despite the best of intentions.       CONCLUSION     I hope the above cleared up some questions of the show, as there were many who appeared \\"confused\\" about the characters. Some were touting Sergeant Jame as an \\"adrenaline junkie\\" and why some of the actions are taken. Nevertheless, what I have stated above are a fragment of my interpretations for the show. Therefore, they remained just interpretations. Do interpret the show in a more logical and creative ways. Would be nice if you can share that.     I have also noticed reviewer's that questioned the accuracy of the show, in terms of equipment, etc. Let there be a reminder that this is a movie production (albeit Hollywood ones), and its not a documentary. Thus there may be basicgaps on the labeling of equipment or summarization on the chain of command.     Most important for this show, I believe it captured the combat fatigue in war (not just this war), which I have mentioned above. There are almost no political statements or overly colored terms to dignify the war. Basically through their little actions, the soldiers showed their dedication to their country and the ones beside them most of the time, even if they may not agree with some aspects of it.     Therefore, I am giving it a 5 stars because not many modern war movies captured this combat fatigue aspect in a subtle, yet embedded and striking way. (If there are, do share with me).    To conclude, it's a must watch for those who have been in the fields.
0393072231|3.0|\\"Then the Lord said to him, 'Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean, but your inward part is full of greed and wickedness.'\\" -- Luke 11:39 (NKJV)<br /><br />This quote from Luke was perfect for me in describing the way that the ratings agencies assigned AAA quality to bundles of worthless mortgages. And because of the high ratings, most people just smiled and got paid well to pass derivatives to whoever was dumb enough to buy them.<br /><br />The Big Short won't be your favorite book about the Wall Street near-collapse, but it will be one of the more memorable ones. Most people see investing in black-and-white terms. There are winners and losers on opposite sides of the same trades. The profits that follow make the winners feel great, and the losses make the losers feel sour. It may work like that in story books, but Wall Street doesn't work that way. Instead, those with the power enrich themselves in the easiest possible ways . . . often with no clue about what's really going on, and with no particular interest in finding out.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is devoted to describing the unusual backgrounds and research that allowed a few skeptics to anticipate the eventual meltdown of a lot of bad paper written around mortgages that should never have been granted. You probably won't find these people to be as interesting as Mr. Lewis does.<br /><br />But there's an ulterior motive . . . to use these skeptics to tell in their own words about the corruption they found at the heart of the mortgage meltdown as it played on out Wall Street.<br /><br />You'll find out just how much money many people made to turn a blind (or dumb) eye on what was going on.<br /><br />His ultimate point is made in the book's final pages as he lunches with John Gutfreund (I'm sure you remember him from Liar's Poker). Lewis argues that Gutfreund's decision to take Salomon public ultimately led the kind of insanity that we just went through, an insanity that he believes that the privately held investment banks would not have permitted to happen. Who knows? Greed and power do some pretty unusual things to people.<br /><br />I was intrigued to see that Goldman, Sachs was the subject of an SEC civil suit for some of what was described here on the day I finished reading the book. Could it be that there is the possibility of public morality prevailing? Someone always takes the blame for Wall Street fiascos. Who will it be this time?<br /><br />Surely this book will help spark some public rage. Stay tuned to see what happens next . . . if anything.ld not have permitted to happen. Who knows?

B003405MF6|3.0|Did someone forget to put directions to the studio in Braille?   As someone else has noted, this is a very tender Jeff Beck record..........................  WHAT????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That should be all you need to know. I don't know what it is with British guys - they all want strings behind them at some point in their careers. This is a very soothing, mellow record, and were it by Mark Knopfler, I'd guess it a movie soundtrack. Beck has a deft and delicate touch throughout, but I stand by the point that I made in the review of the Altan record, that orchestras sweep live dynamic artists out to sea. Maybe that's just the point with the Elegy for Dunkirk. Very beautiful, very moving and the perfect closer as the credits roll on the big screen. Whoever is warbling the notes does so with precise, well edited passion. You starting to get what's wrong with this yet? Even the two tunes with Joss Stone sound like the balls got cut off them. Come back, Rod, all is forgiven.  Maybe I should allow Beck his august pastoral moments.  NOT!  To wit, I'm guessing that Beck's take on Somewhere Over The Rainbow is, in part, a farewell to Les Paul. But the strings veer dangerously on the border of schmaltz, and that's somewhere Les never went. Had you ever caught Les at the Iridium, he often said good night with that tune, and its delicate delivery, completely unaffected, humbled you. Not the same with this record. I wish I were the Major Graham Chapman used to essay so that I could have walked into the recording studio and said \\"Stop, there'll be no more of these silly strings. Now get on with some proper guitar playing.\\"  For the record I hated the stuff with Jan Hammer - anytime someone derides fusion, Blow by Blow is the first record that comes to mind. This is equally a misstep, unless, as I guess, he's gunning for movie work. I am certain that were you to put this on in his Guitar Shop, he'd drill it with a nail gun and be done with it. There is nothing at all wrong with the music or the performance. But more importantly, there is nothing at all right with it either.  Wonder if someone should go look for Andreo......

B0030Y11O2|4.0|I like Michael Moore. I think it's a good thing that the left has an agitator that goes around making lots of noise and raising a fuss, and it helps that he is pretty entertaining. It doesn't help that he often gets in the way of his own message.    To an extent he gets in the way in this movie, which starts off well and has an incredibly powerful message. We see families being made homeless because of a combination of their greed and naivete abetted by lenders who went out of their way to cover-up possible fees and problems with the loans. We also see Wall Street people at a loss to explain credit default swaps, and see government people talking about how horribly run the bailouts were (which, to be fair, do seem to have largely prevented the economy from totally dying). We also see a worker's uprising at Republic Windows and Doors (and, oddly, don't see anything of Blagojevich's appearance at said uprising), and generally we get a message that, \\"these rich people will screw you and will keep screwing you until you force them to stop.\\"    This is a good, valid and powerful message, as well as being 100% accurate. They have the money, but we have the vote and can put a stop to this nonsense any time we choose. We just have to choose to do so.    We also hear about other countries, most notably Germany and Japan, where the workers and government control a great deal of what business does. These are countries that have routinely beat us in the marketplace and do so while having a great many more restrictions on them than companies here do.    But where the movie fails is towards the end, when Moore feels the need to do one of the cute little stunts his movies are so famous for. In \\"Sicko\\" he took 9/11 rescue workers to get medical care in Cuba. In this movie he goes to Wall Street and plays \\"innocent schlub number 114\\", as he tries to get money back from the investment banks and puts crime scene tape all over the place.    This adds an extra fifteen minutes or so to the movie and really doesn't serve much of a purpose. It also gets in the way of the central message of the film.    Moore is right that unfettered capitalism is a horribly evil system, and one that we're totally in love with as a concept. We go out of our way to remove regulations as much as possible and then act surprised when bad things happen. Capitalism is a great, wonderful system when it's very, VERY heavily regulated. With that regulation you get the economies of places like Germany and Japan. Without it, you get what we've had for the last couple years.    A final note: over the end credits we have a lounge version of \\"The Internationale\\". The democratic-socialist in me was very happy about that. :)

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|If watching a film over and over again is any indication of a great story, this one merits such praise.<br /><br />Always playing a quintessential American, he repeats such a performance here as a recently widowed retiree and Korean war veteran who resents the HMong Asians that are taking over his neighborhood. His well-kept home and mannicured lawn adorned with an American flag represent his values, and stands as a beacon in a neighborhood that is being overcome by neglect and overrun by gangs. Wanting to be left alone, his contempt for customs, dress and language of his neighbors is palpable in word and facial expression. He shares almost as much contempt for his neglectful sons, and his granddaughter whom he despises for her dress and lack of manners.<br /><br />A strange relationship develops when he finds out one of his neighbors attempted to steal his pristine, 1972, Gran Torino that he helped build in his assemly line career at Ford Motor Company. The boy's mother insists he make restitution for the family's honor. The man who just wants to be left alone is drawn to the would-be thief and the family he disdains. We see him as a curmudgeon who pays them compliments with insults such as \\"I could use some good gook food,\\" when invited for dinner. In fact his character, Walt Kowalski uses all of them under the Sun (Yat Sen).  Yet, their respect for such a disrespectful man grows, as he takes the boy under his wing and becomes the protector of the rest of his family.<br /><br />This is where Eastwood's performance soars. He appears to be in constant conflict with his prejudice against his sense of justice and fair play. He goes over the edge when one of the family members suffers at the hands of a local gang. Justice must be served and sacrifices must be made. Their mutual devotion replaces the lack of the same with his own family.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has delivered such memorable characters as Dirty Harry and Josie Wales with great lines such as, \\"Go ahead; make my day\\" and \\"Dyin's not much of a livin'.\\" Like a good wine or scotch improves with age, Eastwood becomes equally memorable as a director. When he directs and acts, it is topnotch entertainment from a very simple story of a complicated human being. His supporting cast is also superb, and this film may launch future careers to prominence.

0743298039|5.0|Someone gave me this book as a gift about six or eight months ago. It languished unread while I plodded through an already over-stacked pile of night table reading until I finally noticed it. I like a good Gothic novel as well as the next person so -- my curiosity aroused by having looked at some of the reviews here -- I began reading The Thirteenth Tale.    It was indeed compelling as a Gothic tale in the tradition of the classics and also as a mystery. It was a very satisfying read, and the kind of book that lingers with the reader even after it is finished.    The part that I liked best was something I never would have expected: the characters and their development during the course of the story. As one who is fascinated with human nature in all its varieties and is always curious about what motivates others, the characters in this book were a treasure. Each was fully animated and all were as individual as folks are in real life. Each had his/her point of view and purpose yet I never got the feeling (as one so often does) that they were mere plot devices to advance the story. I came to care about each character and his/her part of the complete tale, albeit the main players most of all.    Ms. Setterfield is a very talented writer and The Thirteenth Tale was intelligently and delightfully told. I look forward to more books by Diane Setterfield.

0446567337|4.0|I wanted to read this book before seeing the movie and I am glad that I did. I think I will still see the movie but I must say, this book left me with mixed feelings. It started out rather slow to me but still it kept me wanting to know more and by the time I finished the book I was a crying mess. This is not my first Nicholas Sparks book but it sure was the one that touched me the most. I just wanted John and Savannah to end up together. I know, I know, the book is called \\"Dear John\\" and he is a soldier so I knew what I was getting myself in to. Not to mention, Mr. Sparks rarely if ever, gives you a happy ending to any of his love stories. STILL, doesn't John desire a little happiness? The book just left me thinking he never loved anyone again. I think when he reenlisted that was the kiss of death for him and Savannah. If he did not know it he should have but I still think he desired a better ending for himself. I am really thinking it would have been better for him if he never met Savannah. Sure, she was his first real love and she opened his heart and mind to new things but she also left him a lonely older man still being hunted by what he could not have with her. Does not seem worth it to me. This is just my opinion of course. After thinking it over, I don't think I will see the movie. Just can't take this sad ending again.

B000001GH9|5.0|If only Berg would have lived a bit longer to hear his most beautiful creation performed. Berg composed this work in 1935 and it takes its main inspiration from the unfortunate death of Alma Mahler's daughter due to polio (Berg was devastated when he learned of this news). Berg was commissioned to write this concerto from violinist Louis Krasner who premiered the work under  Hermann Scherchen in 1936 not long after Berg's death.<br /><br />The music of this concerto is quite interesting as I have never heard such an ingenius combination of 12-tone writing with tonal undercurrents. Berg has been described as the most accessible of \\"The Second Viennese School,\\" which included his teacher and 12-tone pioneer Arnold Schoenberg and composer Anton Webern. I think the reason Berg is more accessible is because he combined the innovations of the 12-tone method with Romantic expression and lyricism. All of Berg's works are marked by this kind of \\"tug-of-war\\" between Schoenberg's Modernism and Mahlerian Romanticism and expression. I think that even though Schoenberg was the pioneer of this method of composition and composed some really innovative music that Berg was the better composer. This, of course, is purely subjective.<br /><br />This recording of Berg's \\"Violin Concerto\\" has been hailed by critics and fans alike. Anne-Sophie Mutter turns in one of her most remarkable performances I think. She is completely committed to Berg's vision and translates the pain and anguish he felt during this time. James Levine also turns in a remarkable performance. His accompaniment is responsive, emotional, dedicated, and passionate. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra are simply outstanding and play wonderfully. The audio quality is also top-notch.<br /><br />The other work on this recording titled \\"Time Chant\\" composed by Wolfgang Rihm for Mutter is of less interest to me. After hearing the Berg, this work seems oddly out-of-place. Another work by Berg would have been more appropriate like his \\"Three Pieces For Orchestra\\" or his \\"Lulu Suite.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, this is really an ear-opening recording and those interested in Berg's work should start here. Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you're really enchanted with this concerto, then get this 8-CD Berg collection as it will be all one truly needs:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000B09Z4 Alban Berg Collection, Deutsche Grammophon, 8-CDs]]hestra\\" or his \\"Lulu Suite.\\"    Anyway, this is really an ear-opening recording and those interested in Berg's work should start here.

B002GZQY6Q|4.0|Long-time listener (since hearing V34 and Up The Downstair on college radio in 1994, thank you WZBC), first-time reviewer.....    By and large, i favor the more Floydian side of PT and SW's work, but i've expanded my mind to get into the harder edges of the band's later work as best i could.  A new Porcupine Tree album is an event, and i've always bought the new release immediately, at least until the last 3 harder albums, each of which took me longer and longer to get into, with diminishing returns on each successive release.    So i waited, and still haven't gotten The Incident.  Pretty unthinkable when you consider how big a fan i have been, and for how long.    Kids, i haven't even listened to the album yet but i can thank you for your help and tell you why i just decided to get The Incident right away.  Reading the reviews here.......i'm 8 pages in, i think....i saw all the recent fans of the harder stuff decrying it as sub-par and too mellow, and most everyone else who ranged from \\"Decent PT is still better than everything else\\" to \\"It's brilliant!\\", and it wasn't until NINE pages in that i saw two consecutive reviews (Sept 24, 2009) wonder why oh why was Great Expectations, a song about a promising young life that didn't turn out as expected, which started out sounding like it would be a great song.....suddenly cut short, less than two minutes?    THAT, my friends, is brilliance.  And is yet another feather in SW's cap.    Hey, i'm all about the music, and always want to hear more of a good thing, but if, thematically, it takes being jarred prematurely out of what i'd been thinking was going to be another epic PT classic for SW to make SURE i got the meaning of \\"Great Expectations \\", well then i'm all for it.    Thanks again for the thoughtful reviews. We're very lucky to be fans of an amazing and underappreciated band.

B002VECMAE|3.0|This movie was alright.  It just wasn't very funny or interesting.  I might have laughed once throughout the movie.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Like many people who follow upcoming movies fairly intensely, I had the ending to Martin Scorsese's newest spoiled for me months ago.  Don't worry dear reader, I'm going to try my hardest not to do the same to you.  But I'm not sure that it mattered so much, really, for me - I think I would have guessed that SOMETHING funny was going on pretty quickly.  It's a film that builds slowly and steadily towards the final revelation, piling on clues in almost every scene - some are quite subtle, some I think would be picked up on even by viewers not so sharp-eyed, by viewers who haven't seen as many films as I have.  To the film's credit, though, I think even people following pretty closely probably won't figure out precisely what is strange about, or wrong with Teddy and his partner Chuck, though most ought to know that something is pretty rotten in the state of Denmark before the halfway point.<br /><br />Well just who are Teddy and Chuck then?  Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are a couple of US Marshalls come to investigate an escaped prisoner at Shutter Island, a facility for the criminally insane and dangerous in Boston Harbor, in 1954.  Apparently a woman, Rachel Solando, who was committed for having drowned her three children, has escaped from a locked room and cannot be found anywhere - though the island is walled by sheer cliffs except in a small beach area where the pier stands, and the weather is so inhospitable that no one could have gotten off to the mainland.  Something's not right though, and as Teddy and Chuck try to figure out what happened to Rachel they begin to wonder just what the doctors, led by Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) are doing with the patients - and Teddy starts to experience nightmares and flashbacks to his own experiences in World War II, which seem to mirror some of the feelings he's having, and perhaps even the events that are occuring in the present day.<br /><br />To say too much more about the film risks revealing too much; suffice it to say that for me this was a beautifully put together psychological thriller and puzzler, and that far from being an example of the director in \\"mainstream\\" mode as some critics have asserted - selling out and dumbing himself down - it's in fact a tribute to the glossy studio filmmaking of old as much as it is a contemporary work.  The whole film has an aura of uber-reality or just classic \\"Hollywood studio\\" reality that fit both the noirish setting and the increasing psychological fantasy angle.  Notice how the sky in most shots looks a little odd - a little digitally altered I think.  Various elements of the landscape often seem to stand out more harshly than they should - or, occasionally, they look softer.  When Teddy's in the cave and the camera looks out it appears completely fake and set-like to me; when he's in the jeep with the warden it's done with rear-projection, or it beautifully mimics the process; the effect is much like that in a Hitchcock film from the mid 50s - THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or VERTIGO.  The blood in the fantasy scenes, in particular that of the Nazi commandant, is overly rich and bright - the phonograph too looks really burnished and bright like old Technicolor.  SHUTTER ISLAND for any flaws it might have as a narrative, is one of the most beautifully shot and lit films I've seen in a long time, with impeccable art direction and production design.<br /><br />About the narrative, again - without revealing too much, I will say that the revelation, when it comes, is a little too tidy, a little too wrapped-up-nice I think, given the wild fantastic moods that the film has developed up until this point.  And for me that was a bit of a problem - I think it could have stood a more \\"open\\" ending, and I think many will agree that it's just a bit too talky, a bit too much of the \\"now, this is why this happened and what it REALLY meant\\".  But at the same time - this isn't David Lynch, though at times there's a faint Lynchian surrealism at work.  This is Scorsese channelling Hitchcock at times, and perhaps Samuel Fuller (whose film SHOCK CORRIDOR is also set in an institution for the criminally insane), and his late friend Michael Powell, whose color films of the 40s had a similar glossiness and artificiality, a heightened or altered reality that wasn't quite fantasy but wasn't everyday either.  I was also reminded, interestingly enough, of Alex Proyas' film DARK CITY which is another film with a very hermetic, closed-in and noirish pulpy atmosphere (SHUTTER ISLAND takes place entirely on the island save for a couple of flashbacks, just as DARK CITY never leaves the eponymous city, and involves a hero with a possibly faulty memory).<br /><br />The use of music recalls other films as well - most of it is rather scary late 20th century classical work by composers like Scelsi, Cage and Ligeti, with a significant role played by the earlier Mahler Piano Quintet.  This isn't the world of the film noir or old Hollywood, more likely something out of a Stanley Kubrick film, and there are some moments where SHUTTER ISLAND seems ready to ascend to the heights of 2001 or THE SHINING.  I'm not trying to suggest that Scorsese is aping or copying all of these other great filmmakers - merely that he is building on their foundations, and giving cineastes like me an extra level of fun; and I don't think the film requires any great cinematic knowledge to succeed, either.  If he doesn't quite, in my opinion, reach the level of some of these great masterpieces, it's probably because the narrative at the end can't really break its bounds and reach for the stars - or for the madness - that it seems to be heading towards.  But darn, it's a fun ride.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, particularly I think Ruffalo in a subtle and very demanding role that has to reveal itself very, very slowly; but for the most part this is Scorsese's show and that of his behind-the-camera people including screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis (adapting a Dennis Lehane novel), music supervisor Robbie Robertson, his usual editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and perhaps especially cinematographer Robert Richardson.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I just rented the new release of Avatar. Only setup, and chapters menu. So if you want the special features, its not in this release. Better to rent and wait until the next \\"improved\\" release. Production is just pushing this one out to so you'll buy 2 or 3 copies of this movie. Good marketing stategy I must admit. But dont be sucked in.
B001LMAK88|4.0|I missed this 1985 Lawrence Kasdan film when it played theatrically; I was in college at the time and this opened in July, over summer break, and I was at home with our one local theater with maybe 5 screens.  Did it even play there?  I dunno, I missed both this one and Clint Eastwood's contemporaneous PALE RIDER; the \\"resurrection\\" of the western passed me by, as it did most people since the genre didn't stay alive for long.  I saw both on VHS in the 90s, and have revisited them just lately on DVD.  It's too bad they didn't do just a little bit better at the box office; neither of the two films are among the best ever, but they're both supremely entertaining and well-crafted, and though they both did OK business in theaters, it wasn't enough.  Clint's film at least turned a good profit, being typically economical and quickly shot and having his name to draw people in; Kasdan's film with it's cast of then-unknowns or second-tier stars and it's very high budget probably lost money or barely broke even, and the director didn't get to make another western for another decade (1994's WYATT EARP).<br /><br />The money shows in the film though, from the superbly done initial sequences detailing the four heroes (Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover) escaping momentary troubles and coming together through chance and circumstance to the beautifully put together set of SILVERADO, the large-scale shootouts and cattle stampedes, and the spectacular on-location photography by John Bailey.  It's rather amazing when you think about it that any studio would fork over $25 million + (a lot of money in 1985) on a western from a relatively untested director (Kasdan had only done the lower-budget BODY HEAT and THE BIG CHILL at this point) in the years immediately following the debacle of Michael Cimino's megaflop HEAVEN'S GATE.  But SILVERADO was designed as a very audience-friendly, all-ages piece from the start, and it's got a slick commercial feel to it that's pretty typical in many ways of the Spielberg-Lucas-Zemeckis films of the era - and mostly in a good way.<br /><br />Basically the storyline goes that Emmett (Glenn), just released after a few years in prison, is going to meet up with his younger brother Jake (Costner) and the two are to visit their sister and her family on their way to California.  But Emmett gets waylaid by some no-accounts and sidetracked, and he ends up helping out gunslinger Paden (Kline) and eventually the two of them witness Mal (Glover) get into some trouble in a small-town bar.  Turns out that Jake is a prisoner in the jail in said small town and Emmett has to bust him out.  Through a series of adventures a little too complex for me to want to lay out here, the four all end up together and in Silverado, a town that is run by Paden's former buddy Cobb (Brian Dennehy) who is garrulous and charismatic and owns half the town including the huge saloon run by Stella (Linda Hunt) which Paden ends up working at.  Turns out that Cobb is behind - or at least involved with - a group of no-accounts who have run Mal's family off their land and gotten into trouble with Jake and Emmett, and eventually a reckoning is going to be coming.<br /><br />The biggest problem that SILVERADO has is that, having established the four main characters and the main nemesis pretty well, it's not content to focus on them but instead has to introduce a whole bunch of other characters who seem to be clamoring for development.  There's John Cleese as the sheriff of Turley, the first town the group rides into; sure, he's not really important but hey, I'd always like to see more of Cleese; there's Rosanna Arquette as a settler whose husband gets killed while riding with our heroes and who ends up being romanced by Paden onscreen - and Emmett mostly offscreen; it's fairly obvious that much of her story is cut from a longer version of the film and the extras on the DVD clarify this a little.  There's Mal's sister Ray (Lynn Whitfield)and her possible budding romance with a knife-thrower and professional gambler named Slick (Jeff Goldblum) - who is never clearly a hero or villain or...anything really other thana a side character who just shows up a couple of times only to suffer an ignominious ending.  Basically there's just too much stuffed into this 130-minute film to fit and it all starts to pull at the seams in the last third in particular.<br /><br />BUT, damn it's a fun film up until that point, and the ending isn't a disaster or anything - just something of a mess for a while.  We get a couple of shootouts at the very end that are fairly satisfying and do manage to save the film, and we get a group of pretty solid western heroes who manage to avoid being TOO cliched while still seeming pretty familiar.  Kasdan and his coscreenwriter/coproducer brother Mark manage to get most of the typical western tropes into place, do a reasonably sensitive job of handling the racial issue with Glover being essentially just another unwanted person only with an extra level of unwanted-ness than the others.  The Kasdans' dialogue manages the difficult trick of seeming someone modern and relateable - yet not altogether too anachronistic.  And Bruce Broughton's terrific score must be mentioned, sweeping and romantic and very, very old-fashioned, the kind of thing you can imagine Dmitri Tiomkin writing for a Howard Hawks or Raoul Walsh film 30 years earlier.<br /><br />The cast is pretty much a dream; I've never been a fan of Costner's but I liked him in a few of his early films, and he shows an energy and uninhibitideness in this film that I've never seen anywhere else.  I'd have to say that at the moment I'd pick this early role, loose and technically imperfect though it might be, as his best work.  The rest of the main cast hold their own - Kline and Glenn seem to be each doing variations of the typical tough and taciturn Wayne/Scott/Eastwood western hero and they both find nice resolutions to the problem; Glover seems more like the family man/future of the west type character and conveys more of a sense of the \\"new westerner\\", the man from the East bringing civilization; Dennehy, the arrogant guy who bosses everybody around through intimidation and a larger-than-life charisma.  The actresses don't really have that much to do but Hunt gets in a couple of good scenes and she clearly represents the civilizing influence also, caught between Dennehy and the slightly more gentle if no less dangerous Kline.<br /><br />All in all, it doesn't add up to anything particularly new or revelatory - though it feels at times like it could have, had it been allowed to be longer and \\"breathe\\" more -  but it certainly does show that one could do a \\"modern\\" western with a young, fresh cast, and not make it stupid or childish.romance with a knife-thrower and professional gambler named Slick (Jeff Goldblum) - who is never clearly a hero or villain or...anything really other thana a side character who just shows up a couple of times only to suffer an ignominious ending.

B0000041DF|3.0|As many reviewers have said, Argerich is quite exciting in this concerto, but I'm amazed that nobody mentions the fact that she plays the short version of the cadenza in the first movement. For me this is a deal-breaker, as the extended cadenza is the highlight of the piece. I wonder why any pianist, especially one given to fireworks like Argerich, would choose the short cadenza. It simply doesn't compare to the long one for drama and virtuosic thrills.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|I was skeptical how they could possibly follow the first one being such a classic.  Well, I never anticipated it would have been this bad...so bad I had to write a review.  All of it felt forced and vulgar for the sake of being vulgar...the acting was cheesy and they tried too hard to rekindle some nostalgia from the first one...it just made this unoriginal with no development amongst any of the characters..the new characters were annoying at best and the dialogue with the brothers was dull and full of lame one-liners.  I almost had to watch the first one right after to try and forget that this sequel never happened.  I advise to stop at the first.  I can't believe we all waited 10 years for this letdown.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|First, do yourself and future generations a favor, get the double CD album, not the 1-CD compilation, it comes with a huge 80-page hard-cover(!) booklet with a beautifully designed cover and chock-full of information and lyrics that is an integral part to understand this 5-year project. See also her show on ted(dot)com, where she explains the spirit behind some of the songs and writers.    Then listen to the album, you'll find each song is a little soulful gem of creativeness, with carefully chosen lyrics from mind-blowing poems, great melodies recorded with many fantastic musicians like Lúnasa <3, and vocals that will haunt you for years to come.  The title of this review comes from The Sleepy Giant, to show that these songs are not all your traditional nursery rhymes, but there are just too many great songs (many that are not on the 1-CD album), covered in other reviews anyway.    And do yourself another favor ignoring the negative reviews from people who were expecting Rock or Pop songs, or listened to some of the single CD songs in a shop! Great recording quality, by the way.
B000W91RUG|5.0|My husband and I happened upon The Big Bang Theory by chance in reruns and had not laughed at a comedy as hard as we have at this one in years. He is an engineer and I have many other friend who are also engineers. It is too funny. I bought him the first season set as a gift and it is one of his favorites. I would recommend it because even after we have seen them more than once, they are still funny.
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House is a great story. This book really keeps your attention throughout the entire book. The Kichen House is filled with history of a different time period. I do not think that the book had a bad moment or a weak moment which is hard to find in a book these days. The author did an absolutely amazing job with this well written story. Once you start reading this book you will be hooked. There are however some difficult parts in the book but still it is worth the read.    If you love a great read or you love history then I highly recommend this book. You will not be disappointed.
B00008DDRX|4.0|During the late 60s/early 70s sports car prototype racing occupied a position in the motor racing pantheon almost as high as that of Formula 1. In fact many F1 stars of the era, Graham Hill, Bruce McLaren, John Surtees etc routinely participated in prototype racing as well as F1. This film is Steve McQueen's homage to the greatest sports car race of them all - the 24 hours of Le Mans. You can view this film in one of two ways. As a quasi-documentary it can be considered as one of the greatest racing films of all times - second only to 'Grand Prix'. The Porsche 917, one of the greatest racing cars ever built, is the real star of this film. The film does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the real Le Mans circa 1970. Unfortunately, if you would like some kind of plot along with your racing movie, the acting and plot of Le Mans makes the acting and plot of Grand Prix look like Shakespeare! Motor racing fans will love this film; other people will probably be bored to tears.

B003B486OY|4.0|This book begins immediately following the conclusion of book two of the trilogy, with eccentric genius Lisbeth Salander hanging between life and death with a bullet lodged in her brain. The fact that the first half of the book has Lisbeth in slow but steady recovery means that the focal character of the series is out of commission, though her indominatable spirit is never repressed.  However, once her protector/friend Blomqvist figures a way for the bedridden young woman to access the Internet, things pick up at a faster and faster pace, especially so when Lisbeth is once again physically as well as mentally functional.  Her brilliance shines through action after action, even though she is to stand trial for attempted murder, a situation manipulated by a clandestine government group determined to keep her confined to a mental institution (as they did fifteen years before). Without giving away the many intrigues of the story, let it be said that Lisbeth's trial is tightly written in Larsson's creative style at its best, and the book's ending brings the trilogy to a very satisfying conclusion.  Would that Larsson had not died, for Lisbeth Salander is a character that could fill the pages of many, many more books.  Our loss!
B002VECM6S|1.0|Any enjoyment and positive message I might have gotten from this film was utterly ruined by one scene in which the lead makes fun of President Bush. Okay, I know that sounds very shallow, but that's the bitter aftertaste I had in my mind after viewing this movie. Disney's \\"Remember The Titans\\" & \\"Glory Road\\" are much better choices. Sandra Bullock did an excellent job, as did all the other actors, but that one scene in which Leigh Anne pokes fun at the President should have been deleted, regardless of whether it occured in real life.
0061537969|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain, by Garth Stein, starts off in the classic novel style, near the end.  In this case, Enzo is an ailing, old dog, and his partner in life, Denny, has to make an end-of-life decision.<br /><br />Then it is back to the beginning before Enzo was even Enzo, and before Denny, a frustrated but talented race car driver, meets Eve, his future human partner.<br /><br />Between this beginning, and the ending you are dreading, is Stein's beautiful story of loyalty, trial, persistence, and love.  And what a story it is!  Throughout, Enzo, who knows he is different from other dogs, and believes he will be reincarnated as a human, tells the story of Denny and Eve, and their daughter, Zoe.<br /><br />What a story it is.  There are incredible highs, and devastating lows.  Denny is more perfect than you know, but with perfection comes exploitation.  Denny's loves are ripped from him, and only Enzo and racing remain.  And when racing also seems ready to end, Denny's life seems over.  Denny's ability to achieve victory on courses that other drivers find problematic (he is widely known for his ability to find success on rainy courses, hence the title of the book) is connected to his trials off the course.<br /><br />When life gives you thunderstorms, do you drive through life differently?  How?  Why?<br /><br />This book clearly will be popular on the book club circuit.  I understand it is also going to become a movie starring Patrick Dempsey (and, of course, the dog who is playing Enzo).<br /><br />\\"In Mongolia, when a dog dies, he is buried high in the hills so people cannot walk on his grave. The dog's master whispers into the dog's ear his wishes that the dog will return as a man in his next life.  Then his tail is cut off and put beneath his head, and a piece of meat or fat is placed in his mouth to sustain his soul on its journey; before he is reincarnated, the dog's soul is freed to travel the land, to run across the high desert plains for as long as it would like.<br /><br />I [Enzo] learned that from a program on the National geographic Channel, so I believe it is true.

B001UV4XWY|1.0|This movie is a complete waste of time.  Do not buy it or rent.  Save your time and money.  The plot is awlful. Enough said!!!
B00335EQ0E|3.0|I remember watching this a lot when I was younger (I didn't own it, just rented it many times). As time went on, my memories of it faded and, even when it was on TV, it wasn't a movie I was dieing to see again. So thanks to this new release, I bought it for my sister and finally saw the whole thing from beginning to end. It really isn't, to me anyway, a Disney Classic when compared to Snow White, Bambi, Dumbo or Cinderella. The story is all over the place, but that might also work for it as Wonderland really isn't a coherent place. I don't think Disney should've tried to make a musical out of it. The songs really add nothing to the plot (especially the song Alice sings in the beginning) and while a few are memorable (the Unbirthday Song for example), they're not as memorable as Baby Mine, Someday My Prince Will Come, Feed the Birds, etc. The supporting characters are memorable; the Mad Hatter, March Hare, Queen of Hearts for example do leave an impression (mainly, I think, due to their voice actors), its Alice who is ultimately the blandest character of the whole production. She's not all that interesting as at first she's like \\"In my world things that do this would do that and things that do that would this\\", then she chases the White Rabbit, runs into a character, resumes her chase of the White Rabbit and then cries how she wants to go home, which to me, makes Alice seem more or less of a Dorothy clone. Her voice actress also doesn't help make the character stand out among the Disney pantheon. I know its the same girl who does Wendy's voice in Peter Pan (again, not really a stand out movie or character in the Disney library), but in either case, she doesn't seem to do anything to make the character memorable. She's dull, listless and I swear she gets one of the most awkward dialog to song transitions in musical history (it happens as she sits in the forest wondering why she doesn't listen to the advice she gives herself). On another good note, the animation that Disney was known for is a standout, the backgrounds imparticular, which were probably one of the reasons this has linked itself to the drug culture of the late 60s. What it comes down to is that, while not outright bad like some of the stuff the studio does today, it really isn't one of their finest moments and its a really lifeless story that doesn't do the author's work any justice. And the fact that three (possibly more from what I've heard) directors don't seem to add anything, making it seem like each one was trying to outdo the other (much like the 5 directors featured in the 1967 Casino Royale, another jumbled mess of a film but more or less entertaining).isney was known for is a standout, the backgrounds imparticular, which were probably one of the reasons this has linked itself to the drug culture of the late 60s.

B002ZG983M|3.0|I find Kick-Ass a hard movie to judge. It's a superhero satire/parody which manages to poke fun of everything from superhero movies to real life monotony. It's got some fun and (purposely) offensive ideas which can (and did) offend as many people as it entertains. While I thought Kick-Ass started off fun with a great in-your-face attitude it burns itself out pretty quickly. Too much of a good thing maybe?<br /><br />The story of Kick-Ass more or less follows the comic with some entertaining embellishments. Dave is a high school nerd who decides to throw on a costume and fight crime. After eventually taking down some hoodlums he becomes an internet sensation on Youtube and manages to attract 'real' superhero Big Daddy and his 11-year old daughter Hit Girl. Big Daddy and Hit Girl are trying to take down a local mafioso and Dave ends up getting in over his head. Kick-Ass's story has got some great gags and like most send-ups is played for laughs, though I actually found the situations the characters got into (and the observations of society and internet culture) more funny than any of the actual dialogue or the over-the-top action.<br /><br />The acting in Kick-Ass is great all around. Aaron Johnson is perfectly relatable as Dave and strikes a sort of anti-Peter Parker vibe. Nicholas Cage is fun and campy as Big Daddy and Chloe Moretz steals every scene as Hit Girl. Mark Strong has proved himself capable at playing a villain and is no less effective as the mafioso in Kick-Ass.<br /><br />The action scenes in Kick-Ass are very slick and very violent. A lot of people were put off by seeing Hit Girl killing and mutilating bad-guys as well as being physically tortured later in the film. If you are offended by  this then probably best to stay away as most of the last third of the film is filled with these scenes. I personally have seen much more offensive scenes (in much BETTER films) so it didn't really effect my enjoyment.<br /><br />One thing as a comics fan I loved about Kick-Ass was the use of color. Every character in this film whether in superhero costume or civilian clothes looks like they were pulled straight from a comic book ( I also like the 'comic-panel' subtitles).<br /><br />While I liked Kick-Ass for the most part I did feel a bit burned out by the end. The movie keeps introducing wackier and more violent action and situations and keeps going on for almost two hours! Maybe I'm being too harsh but when a film is simply being played for yucks without introducing anything new it starts to feel like it's wasting my time. It's like a comedian that tells a sick but funny joke but instead of building on it just tells the same joke over and over again making it raunchier and raunchier.<br /><br />Obviously I'm in the minority with my luke-warm opinion of Kick-Ass.

1439153663|5.0|Author Kathleen Grissom's debut novel about slavery in the South in the late 1700's, early 1800's is one of the best out this year.  Readers who enjoyed \\"The Help\\" will find this reading heavier and more heart-wrenching, but will be just as captivated by its characters. This thought-provoking look at life on a tobacco plantation in that era both shocks us and draws us into the souls of these compelling characters, the white owners, the black slaves, and the little white girl who is brought in as an indentured servant, with whom we \\"experience\\" her growth into womanhood. Totally believable and thoroughly researched I have not read a novel this compelling in some time.<br /><br />Told in the voice of two of the main characters, it is easy to keep up with the story line.  Lavinia is the first voice, the main character, an Irish orphaned 7-year old girl brought in to live and work with the negroes in the Kitchen House.  At that time the kitchens actually were commonly in a separate house away from the main house. When she is brought onto the plantation by the white owner, she does not remember the trauma that orphaned her on a shipful of Irish immigrants. The black servants become her family.  Belle, one of the black slaves, is the secondary narrator who becomes a mother-figure to Lavinia and her story is typical as to what mulatto (half-white, half-black) women had to deal within that era, as white owners took advantage of black women who sired children as a result. Marshall, the white son of the owners, is a major character in this saga as well, and as a reader you will struggle with your feelings about him ... first heartbreak and pity, and later on anger and hate for him as his character is formed throughout the novel.

1932100660|5.0|A co-worker of mine talked about this book and how it changed his eating lifestyle.  I searched the book at Amazon and bought it and just by reading its first chapter, I am already hooked.  I haven't finished the book yet but the contents so far of what I've read is so right on.  I have been since discussing it with my wife, love ones and even giving it to a friend of mine as a birthday gift today.  It could be the most valuable gift that she'll receive in her life, hoping that she'll read and follow it.  I have also YouTube'd the book and its author and there are several videos of Dr. Campbell talking about his book and having the proper nutrition.  Since then, I changed my eating habits and been eating plant-based diet.  I have three small kids of my own (ages 4 (boy) and 1-year old twin girls) and I want them to live a healthy long life with them.  Both me and my wife are in our 30's so we definitely want to live a healthy, long life.  It's not about the quantity of life, its about the quality of living a healthy long life.

B00012QM8G|5.0|I thought that this was a great movie. It shows that Oscar Schindler even though a Nazi helped out thousands of Jews. It shows the struggle of what the Jews went through, but also how much effort it took Schindler to get the Jews into his factory. I think that this movie it showed what happened to the Jews, but I also thought that it should that not all Jews were killed. There were some Jews that got saved by this one man. Because of Schindler there are now more Schindler Jews. There were parts of the movie that I did think was very cruel such as killing people for no reason. This movie is very graphic so children should not watch this movie. Also make sure that you set aside 3 hours and 16 minutes because that is how long the movie is. Also it would not be a good movie to watch before you go to bed. It does have a happy ending, but there are some parts that are not so happy.

B000JJCQ68|5.0|I thought that this was a great movie. It shows how one man Oskar Schindler can save more than a thousand Jews. It also shows to what great detail Schindler wanted to have these Jews come work at his factory. There were some cruel parts in the movie such as people getting killed for no reason. I know that there are some bad parts, but the movie does have a good ending. If it was not for Oskar Schindler there would no be any Schindler Jews left. He saved them from getting killed. I do not recommend that children watch this movie. It is very graphic. Also you want to make sure that you allow 3 hours and 16 minutes to watch the movie. It also would not be a good movie to watch before you go to sleep.

0393072231|5.0|In describing the behavior of Wall Street bankers prior to the financial crisis, many adjectives have been bandied about. Greedy, say some; arrogant, claim others. What is only now beginning to gain ground on these populist declarations of discontent is a third, and far more horrifying, descriptor: stupid. This trait may at first seem less offensive to those of us who flaunt our self-prescribed moral superiority over these perceived miscreants. The reality, however, is anything but comforting. In The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine, Michael Lewis, author of Moneyball and Liar's Poker, dabbles in the thriller genre, often to hilarious effect, as he details the inner workings of a financial world that was truly ill-prepared for its inevitable Waterloo.    I'll admit it: The Big Short is a very, very entertaining book. Mine is an admission whose sheepishness can only be understood once one has finished reading the book. It reads like a John Grisham novel, yet John Maynard Keynes is a far likelier neighbor on a library shelf. Lewis is profligate in his use of such terms as \\"big Wall Street firms\\" (32 occurrences, according to Google Books) and he is wont to transcribe entire conversations whose accuracy is often questionable but whose content leaves the reader in stitches.    Ultimately, it is funny, isn't it? Here were our best and brightest, as David Halberstam might say, assuring us that our money was safe, that real estate prices would continue to rise, that subprime loans were the healthy product of a heightened ability to reduce risk, not a house of cards upon which much of the global economy now rested precariously. And they were wrong, not because they intentionally lied (though some did), but because they failed to recognize the bright red flags everywhere on (and sometimes off) their own balance sheets.    The Securities and Exchange Commission's civil lawsuit against Goldman Sachs this week has resulted in even more vitriolic rhetoric against investment bankers and their ilk, a demographic Lewis takes no pains to please in The Big Short. He opens his book with this: \\"The willingness of a Wall Street investment bank to pay me hundreds of thousands of dollars to dispense investment advice to grown-ups remains a mystery to me to this day.\\" And he ends it on an account of his lunch with an investment banker, his old boss at Salomon Brothers, recounted with equal parts nostalgia and regret. In between, he rips apart much of the industry, railing against \\"the madness of the machine\\" and buttressing his anecdotes with footnotes that occasionally take up half the page.    It's hard to say whom Lewis ridicules more, the bankers or the ratings agencies: while The Big Short is premised on the fact that high-powered bankers failed to research or even understand their own investments, Lewis makes it painfully clear that the foundation upon which all risk analysis rested was the highly coveted -- and, it turns out, highly manipulable -- ratings from industry leaders such as Moody's and Standard and Poor's. According to Lewis, employees of these firms, instead of conducting far-reaching investigations into the nature of subprime collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), they simply took at face value much of what the banks told them. And since there were large fees to be had for each rating bestowed on these shadowy financial instruments, Moody's and S&P had significant incentive to perpetuate the subprime industry.    In one particularly enlightening passage, Steve Eisman, one of the book's central characters whose disgust for Wall Street types figured prominently into his investing strategy, explained the lack of incentives for analysts at ratings agencies, a misalignment that helped to create and foster the crisis. \\"'They're underpaid,' said Eisman. 'The smartest ones leave for Wall Street firms so they can help manipulate the companies they used to work for. There should be no greater thing you can do as an analyst than to bethe Moody's analyst...So why does the guy at Moody's want to work at Goldman Sachs? The guy who is the bank analyst at Goldman Sachs should want to go to Moody's. It should be that elite.'\\"    The Big Short is filled with quotes such as this. And although not all of them are as penetrating or as keenly observant of the recession's underlying fault lines, each is helpful in piecing together a panorama of the landscape that existed in and around these \\"big Wall Street firms.\\" Michael Lewis has not compiled a tell-all here; if he has revealed any industry secret, it is simply the astonishing truth that, in the subprime lending business, there were none. When the dust had settled around our financial ground zero, it soon became apparent that even Wall Street had failed to understand Wall Street. In this, if nothing else, it shares the same fate as Main Street.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bought the black and blue versions of this fine watch. They serve as my day-to-day watch. As noted in other reviews, a self-winding watch is more accurate than a mechanical watch but far less accurate than a quartz watch. Quartz watches are off by about 2-3 seconds/month, compared to atomic clocks. Self-winding watches are off by about 7 minutes/month. I've found the difference to be negative not positive. Sieko says about 5 minutes/month.<br /><br />But, here's one advantage: you won't have to wind it, just wear it. That makes it the best watch available in the future ahead. It's getting harder to get my battery replaced on quartz watches and it will likely become impossible in future.<br /><br />It only takes about 39 hours for the battery to run down so it helps to rotate it (to wind) about 2-3 minutes a day. I can usually wind it in a commercial break.<br /><br />The drawbacks with the black model:<br /><br />* harder to keep clean;<br /><br />* the day and date diasl are harder to read because the face is black and so are the letters.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great watch.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please add your vote.<br />____________________________________________________________<br /><br />My review of the blue watch:<br /><br />Xbar 107 seconds/week (runs fast) (7 min./month compared to 2-4 sec./month quart watch)<br />St DEV 27 sec.<br />N = 7<br />95% CI 2.447 using Student's t<br />m+ = 136 seconds/week<br />m- = 78 seconds/week<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Good points:<br />* Beautiful with dark blue face, white symbols, functional medium blue nylon band;<br />* Easy to read, even in the dark;<br />* Easy to use with uncomplicated settings similar to other watches;<br />* Compact design;<br />* Measurement consistency is excellent compared to quartz mechanism.<br /><br />Bad points:<br />* Difficult to set time (see instruction below);<br />* Gains 10 seconds a day (consistency); and<br />* Does not have a manual wind stem.<br /><br />Discussion<br />This watch looks great. Unlike other self-winding or kinetic watches, this one is compact. In the best tradition of Japanese product development they thought hard on how this watch should function and say about the wearer. The hands are easy to reading, even for those of use with failing eyesight. The second sweep hand has a red tip allowing easy setting of the time.<br /><br />Unlike some Japanese product, they provided a short, simple instruction on winding the watch. Here, I am comparing them to Citizen's ecco-drive watch, which I also own. Just gently work your arm back and forth for three minutes and the self-wind watch will charge; or, you could wear it for a day.<br /><br />Okay, now for the negatives. First, this is not your quartz watch. The original self-winding mechanism was invented, according to Wikipedia, by a Swiss watchmaker in 1770. Since then it has gone through several improvements but is not as accurate as the quartz mechanism popularized starting in the 1970's. Sieko warns that this watch could be off by as much as 10 seconds a day. One days use indicates that my watch runs about 10 seconds fast.<br /><br />The great watchmaker Harrison, who invented the first chronometer accurate enough to track longitude, said that consistency is more important than accuracy. (A poor copy of one of Harrison's chronometers was carried by Captain Cook on his circumnavigation of the globe. He had nothing but good things to say about it.) I have another self-winding watch, an Armitron, which runs consistently 15 seconds fast on days that I wear it.<br /><br />From my measurements of quartz watches, their accuracy, while dazzling when compared to old hand-wound watches, are less accurate than my old German pendulum clock. So I am told, the longer the arm, the more stable the swing and the more accurate the timepiece. I compare everything to atomic time. And, because the quartz mechanism is battery-driven, it seems to suffer from inconsistency.I carefully measured my collection of six quartz watches over a 2 year period. While the battery was new, the error was consistent. As the battery burned out, the error became difficult to predict. Sometimes a positive error (adding time) would become a negative error (losing time) as the battery died. This dying period was also hard to predict.<br /><br />The accuracy of the quartz mechanism is not as good as my pendulum clock. They all lost or gained approximately 2-3 seconds, on average, per month.<br /><br />Based on a week of measurements with the Armitron, I would say that it is shockingly inaccurate but consistently so. Assuming that the Sieko error continues to be consistently 10 seconds fast this will mean that I will have to reset it every week. This is a small price to pay for an otherwise beautifully crafted and honestly-priced handiwork.<br /><br />Setting time<br />The date and day are fairly easy. I suggest turning the watch arms until the click past a day so you won't be twelve hours off.<br /><br />Setting the time is another matter. What works best is to set the hour and minute hands, then gently hold the second hand. It should pulse a little as it tries to force itself forward. Once the seconds are accurate, release and the second hand should be accurate. It takes a little practice at first and don't set the time until you pump the watch 3 minutes to charge the spring.<br /><br />Time to unwind<br />It takes about 39 hours (1 test) to unwind.r became difficult to predict.

0786298863|3.0|It would have been a much better read if the author used a variety of adjectives rather than the same ones over and over again. I read the whole book, so it must have held my interest enough, but I'm not running to the book store looking for another by this author.
B000LAZDQA|3.0|The film is actually pretty interesting and it certainly creates a different standard of what is appropriate for an audience and from an actor/actress. Lots of bodily fluids and behavior is seen which would not normally appear in a main stream video. The seller was helpful in being prompt about returning my money after I sent the movie back. The film did not run properly after about 1 hour and 20 minutes, it started nreaking down digitally. The seller does not provide replacements, only money back. Logically, if one of the batch was improperly copied by the manufacturer, so likely are the others. Same thing happend with Crouching Tiger, it took 3 years to find a copy that was not digitally fractured. The question arises, do the manufacturers ever bother to test the product before they ship??
B000002MJC|5.0|No objective or analytical review for this one, it's all subjective. Which IMHO befits this gorgeous gem.  I was raised Catholic and endured 12 years of Catholic school, so the darkish, rich and hymn-like sound works for me.  I don't consider myself Catholic anymore, and in fact think it borders on a cult, but nobody said you can't appreciate elements from it, even if you aren't buying the whole package.      Back to this album, I think a lot of DM fans turned off by the concept of this album got way too literal and shut their minds and hearts based on title alone.  DM has always dealt in themes of submission, surrender, alienation and longing, essential elements of Catholic faith (my opinion), so the juxtaposition of spirituality with a DM concept album is hardly a shocker as far as I'm concerned.    David Gahan's tortured interpretations have an almost Jesus' temptation in the desert feel to me.  Given his struggles with Heroin, particularly at that time, I suspect Gore's lyrical nods to  temptation and devotion (i.e., addiction) consciously used Gahan's addiction for inspiration.  Gore's lilting, reaching vocals on One Caress provide an Easter Morning counterweight.    This album was and is gorgeous.  The pain makes the occasional beauty that much more haunting and bittersweet.
B003405MF6|4.0|To begin, I have never owned any Jeff Beck music before this release.  After reading many reviews, it seems like the fans are pretty divided on this release, but I'm glad I purchased it.  I play guitar, and I hear his name come from interviews and articles, but I had never really given him a listen.  I watched some of his live videos, and after seeing him play A Day in the Life I really knew I wanted to check this out.  I have listened to several of his contemporaries, and I personally don't believe he stands up to the mark of Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, John Petrucci, etc.  There are many of these guys that are famous for bright, melodic, flashy playing.  He is good, but not THAT good.  However...  I do think his tone is amazing.  I am fascinated that he doesn't even use a pick, but he plays all of these complex pieces with fingers only.  He really shines on the emotional guitar parts in this album.  I would have wanted to see more blues come out, or maybe even some shredding.  I do really enjoy hearing the orchestra back him up on some of the songs.  I'm a big fan of mixing classical music with rock/blues/metal elements.    This album is a win for me because I can easily unwind and relax while listening to this.  In my opinion, everyone needs to own some albums like this just to calm down and lower stress levels.  I didn't come into this album with many, if any, expectations except just to hear a good guitar player.    My issue with Mr. Beck is that there isn't a great deal of good songwriting on this album.  The only two song credits that bear his name also share credit with Jason Rebello.  His ability to pick out melodies from good pieces of music and translating them to guitar is remarkable, but I would like to see him craft some good songs on his own.    If you are an avid fan, I guess my advice is to know what you are buying before you buy it.  If you don't mind some mellow, slow guitar for the most part, buy this and enjoy it.  You won't be sorry.  If you wantto hear some real hot shot guitar virtuoso guitar licks/moves, this may not be the album for you.  The man is a guitar player's guitar player, so I think anyone that plays should hear this.  The album is fluid, it seems to be one large work instead of ten, and it will inspire people to practice more guitar/work on guitar playing tone.  The track that speaks most to me at the moment is Nessun Dorma.  It has some great lead playing and some great bass guitar as well.  Check it out!!
B001QGRIO8|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book and hoped that it would be a great read as the previous Twilight books have been. But as I got about half way through it, I was beginning to feel like I was reading more of a soap opera type novel instead of a thriller novel. I think the storyline took a turn for the worse and became a little too \\"over the top\\". There were good parts to the novel and did enjoy most of it, but there were some serious flaws in the story nearing the end that just made me want to put it down. Unfortunate, as this has been one of my favorite series until now.
0439023483|4.0|A very interesting read. Not my usual genre, and not one that I really enjoy reading, but the author is quite good. Taking current themes such as obsession with both reality TV and physical beauty and our distrust of government to an extreme, she shows us a future picture of a culture that is almost totally immune to the suffering of others and of a government that is bent on absolute control over the lives of its citizens.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***The coldness with which Katniss and the others are able to kill their oppenents is disturbing. The culture seems to have completely driven compassion away. Only when she cradles Rue as she dies does Katniss display any tenderness. Even her thoughts of Prim seem to draw more of an animal protective instinct than any emotion from her.***END SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />I look forward to reading the second in the series in hopes that a more human Katniss will emerge, one who is able to overcome the tragedies in her life to find some level of love and happiness.
B00371QQ2U|1.0|After reading some reviews (here and elsewhere), I actually decided not to buy this disk. I love the movie, but I am not going to support Universal bastardizing the BluRay format and using it to push down aggresive marketing. It's not pirates who hurt sales, it's badly made releases that insult the paying customer. If I pay for the movie, I want to be able to watch it without having to go through too much hussle and I certainly don't want social networking and other bul****. I buy movies to watch them. So thank you Universal, I'll pass (I also contacted the studio to let them know they lost a paying customer - not because of piracy but because of their own arrogance).

B00275EGWY|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much. It really felt like you were involved in the actions that the actors were involved in. It added a sense of reality that most war movies do not have, imho.    The cinematography is the primary strength of this film, but explosions definitely aide the process of watching the movie. There are surprising moments of interiority with the 3 central characters and that's what made this film so fascinating to me.
014241543X|5.0|There is a word in the provided book summary that explains my feelings about this book exactly: heartache. As you can imagine, the topic of this novel is quite heavy.<br /><br />Our author, Gayle Forman, writes so beautifully that you are able to read the main character's thoughts without turning away from sadness, as long as you are able to handle a little of the aforementioned heartache. We are simply bystanders (in more than one sense of the word) as the events in this book unfold - we are forced to go along with the decisions made and the feelings felt, even if it hurts.<br /><br />Luckily, there is a sequel slated for this book (entitled Where She Went), which I am very excited to read.<br /><br />I am fairly certain this book would make the \\"must read\\" list if you were to make a list of YA books that should be read in a lifetime, so I suggest you pick it up if you have not had a chance to yet.<br /><br />Book Cover: 4/5<br />Book Title: 5/5<br />Plot: 8/10<br />Characters: 8/10<br />Writing: 8/10<br />Ending: 8/10<br /><br />Overall: 41/50

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I purchased this removable storage bag for my Maclaren Quest, and I don't have any complaints about it. It comes very handy on walks, since it can fit 2 cups or bottles, snacks, cellphone, keys, wallet. All the little stuff you might need on a walk. It stays in place and doesn't lose its shape if it's not packed. It's a cheap, but quality alternative, if you need an additional storage on your Maclaren. You have to remove it if you are folding the stroller, but that would be inevitable with any additional removable storage accessory, since it's a very compact umbrella stroller. Great invention!
0061922315|4.0|\\"Everything's more complicated than it seems,\\" 20-year-old Asha confesses to her adoptive American mother at the end of a search for her biological parents and a yearlong stay in India, her country of birth.<br />Asha is both the bond and the source of turmoil for two women, unknown to each other, living in two different continents, leading distinctive lives. One is Kavita, a farmer's wife and Asha's birth mother. The other woman, is Somer, a Stanford graduate and pediatrician who is unable to have babies. The decisions each of them made seemed to be straightforward. For Kavita, leaving Asha at an orphanage meant her little baby would not become another infanticide statistic.  For Somer, adopting Asha meant fulfilling her longing to become a mother. But what they didn't foresee was that their actions would have far more complicated emotional repercussions within themselves and in others.<br /><br />\\"Secret Daughter\\" follows the lives of Kavita, Somer and Asha over a period of twenty years or so.  The multiple narrators in the novel give the readers an insight into the minds and souls of each member (included are Kavita's and Somer's husbands) in both families, as they have to deal with personal conflicts and their own countries' social and cultural expectations.  But Gowda's book is also about motherhood and the sacrifices women will make for the welfare of their families, no matter whether that family is the result of blood ties or of love given unconditionally.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't help but feel for all the major characters, even Jasu, Kavita's husband and the reason that she had to give up her baby.  None of them is flat. On the contrary, these characters are complex human beings beset by doubts, fears, regrets and sorrows but also capable of love, courage and forgiveness.  I haven't read many books about India so Gowda's novel provided me with a glimpse into the two faces of this country and its rich cultural traditions.  \\"Secret Daughter,\\" however, is at its best in the details that bring out their characters' real or perceived differences in their search for identity and belonging.at its best in the details that bring out their characters' real or perceived differences in their search for identity and belonging.
B003B02OOG|5.0|John Grisham is a superb storyteller.  My only complaint with him is his tendency to close his books poorly.    This collection of short stories represents some of his best work.  Each has an interesting story to tell.  All demonstrate Grisham's knowledge of small town/rural southern life.    Lawyers appear in most, but they do not dominate the collection.  Some of the stories are funny, some are serious.  But they all have something to say, and all are well told....including well thought out endings.    Highly recommended.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Maybe my three year old knows other songs but I don't think he currently cares about anyone else's songs other than Michael Jackson.      My wife has MJ's songs on her cell phone and quite frankly, he knows how to work her cell phone better than I do!  And to put this into perspective, when I was a little tike, I grew up with the Jackson Five and idolized MJ myself but I knew others that were popular as well.  The Yellow Submarine, Come On Baby Light My Fire, Bridge Over Troubled Water, It's a Family Affair come to mind along with Ben, ABC, Give Me One More Chance etc (Not necessarily the actual titles but what come to my mind when I think back on those days.      Maybe because it was music that was popular with older brothers and sisters or parents but my son again, is crazy about MJ and MJ only!  So we pick up this DVD at the local movie rental and my son is in his favorite place, watching and listening to MJ perform and low and behold, I'm feeling like I did when I watched him perform as a child myself!    Michael Jackson indeed was a talent the likes of which, the world hasn't ever seen and will not see again.  But this also shows you his technical side or better put, his \\"Perfectionist\\" side.  Something I didn't realize was how involved he was in every aspect of his performances from the dance moves, to singing, to how the music was played and his influence on making it \\"JUST RIGHT\\" for the benefit of his fans.    We rented this but I am adding it to my list of things to buy.  It's a keeper!  Not only for my three year old but for everyone in this home that loves Michael Jackson and that's all of us.  In my opinion anyone that is a true MJ fan who hasn't viewed this, is doing themselves a great disservice.  This certainly is it!

038541627X|5.0|Isaac Asimov is one of my favorite writers. I have enjoyed many of his books and many of his short stories. Foundation is my favorite book. On Spring break, while I was in Mexico, I decided to reread my favorite short stories of the book Isaac Asimov: The Complete Stories Vol. 1. Here are my reviews:    Ugly Little Boy. In this story, a company called Stasis Inc. creates a way to bring things from the past into the future, albeit in a small \\"bubble\\". The first experiment brings a neanderthal boy and the story follows the relationship between the little boy and his babysitter.  The story is very good, using a cool idea to tell a heartfelt story.    The Dead Past. The book starts with this short story and what a way to start. This is my favorite Asimov short story. In the story, scientists have developed a device that can view the past. The government controls all research, hence one needs to get permission from the government to use the device. A historian gets frustrated from not getting the grant and thinks there is a conspiracy from the government to prevent researchers from using this device. It is clear there is a conspiracy, but the ending is very surprising and the explanation is very interesting. This is one of the stories that has had me thinking the most since reading it. I love it.    Breeds There a Man...?. This story is about a paranoid scientist who believes that we are all an experiment of higher beings and that this is the reason that human history goes through cycles of amazing intellectual growth followed by terrible calamities (From the Greeks to the Middle Ages, the Black Plague right after the Renaissance). The story itself, is very good, with interesting conversations between the important paranoid scientist and his psychologist. A memorable story.    The Last Question. This is Asimov's favorite short story. I didn't love it the first time I read it, but this time I liked it more. I can see why Asimov would consider it his favorite, as it does explore the interesting question of whether the universe is immortal, but I like other stories more.    Jokester. The ending in this story is quite shocking and in fact, I only reread the ending this part. The story is a nice joke about jokes.    Hostess. Asimov rarely writes stories involving aliens and this is one of them. I remember enjoying it very much when I first read it, and I enjoyed it very much again. Asimov does a very good job of mixing a mystery with science fiction.    Nightfall. The most famous of his short stories, considered to be the best science fiction short story of all time (although this was awarded in the 60s). The story is very good and I loved it the first time I read it. However, it wasn't as good upon rereading it. While I originally thought the story had interesting views of religion and science, this time when I read it, it seemed much more about science than religion. The science in it is really cool, considering how difficult it would be to discover the cosmos if one wouldn't have nights. How terrifying night would be, if you had seven suns that would keep the planet alight all year long. This is a great story, but not my favorite.    What I really love about Asimov is how his stories always make me think about some interesting concept. I love that his stories are logical and I like that his writing is straightforward and easy to understand.

B002YIHO7I|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in the new Sade CD. She has been gone 10 years, I expected better. There are only 3 songs I like, not love and the rest is trash. She should have worked harder or left her career in tacted without blemish. Sade ~retire~
B000URDEB0|5.0|If you're a fan of not only metal, but music in general, you will love this. Haunting and beautiful female vocals, driving metal riffs, and a strong operatic/symphonic overtone. Put all of that together with lyrics that have some real meaning, and you've got one great album. This is my first Nightwish purchase, but I think I'll be investing in their entire discography. Their music moves me.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about getting this, just hit up YouTube and watch the videos for Amaranth, Bye Bye Beautiful, and The Islander. Seriously good music.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|In its superb third season, \\"Chuck\\" continues its highly entertaining blend of drama, comedy, and romance.  At Season Two's end, nice guy computer nerd and CIA asset Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) uploaded into his own brain a new, improved Intersect which not only restored his ability to \\"flash\\" on espionage information, it also provided access to new skills.  As he told his CIA handler Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) and her NSA partner John Casey (Adam Baldwin) at the time, \\"Guys, I know Kung Fu.\\"<br /><br />In Season Three, Chuck, no longer an accidental tourist in the espionage world, embarks on a bumpy, uncertain journey to becoming a full-fledged spy.  This journey involves a painful Catch-22.  Chuck must succeed in becoming a spy to stay close to Sara Walker, his erstwhile bodyguard and romantic interest, but each step towards spyhood seems to take him further away from the decent, honest guy that Sara secretly cherishes.<br /><br />At the beginning of Season Three, Chuck makes two critical mistakes: He disappoints Sara and he flunks spy school.  In search of second chances, Chuck must accept tutoring from the experienced, ruthless CIA agent Daniel Shaw (Brandon Routh in an extended guest role), a man with questionable intentions toward both Chuck and Sara.  Chuck will also suffer hilarious difficulties in keeping his real and spy lives separate.  New brother-in-law \\"Captain Awesome\\", best friend Morgan, and Chuck's co-workers at the BuyMore become entangled in spy plots, while Team Bartokowski members Sara Walker and John Casey experience some surprising personal and professional challenges.<br /><br />Season Three was originally programmed for thirteen episodes before being extended to nineteen.  Lucky \\"Chuck\\" fans will thus be treated to two excellent season finales.  In the first, Chuck will resolve his conflicts with Shaw and with Sara.  In the second, Chuck's spy life will collide with his family life in a game-changing way.<br /><br />\\"Chuck: The Complete Third Season\\" is most highly recommended to fans of the series.ghly recommended to fans of the series.

B0002C4JE4|4.0|When James Taylor wrapped up his years with Warner Brothers records in 1976, that label promptly issued a greatest hits CD that remains one of the label's biggest sellers. Issued one of the RIAA's earliest \\"Diamond\\" certifications, this album has sold over ten million copies and remains available to this day. It's a time-capsule of Taylor's early work, spotlighting the years of sensitive singer-songwriters and his calm, soothing voice.<br /><br />Staring with re-recorded versions of his Apple Records songs \\"Carolina In My Mind\\" and \\"Something In The Way She Moves\\" and a previously unreleased live version of \\"Steamroller Blues,\\" this was Taylor before he became a staple on the summer festival circuit and a cover-er of oldies (although his version of \\"How Sweet It Is\\" is included here). There's a lot to be said for the simple pleasures of this collection, be it the warm reading of Carole King's \\"You've Got a Friend\\" (with Joni Mitchell on back-up vocals, it won Taylor his first Grammy) or the confessional \\"Fire and Rain.\\"<br /><br />After this, Taylor would be come more the studious professional that intimate singer-songwriter, continuing to make solid, if predictable soft-rock albums for CBS. There are two best of's since this one, a Columbia round-up on [[ASIN:B000050HV9 James Taylor's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2]] and a full on retrospective on [[ASIN:B00007IT8S The Best of James Taylor]] (both labels represented, but heavy on the Warners years). The biggest gripe is that this CD has yet to receive a proper remastering, but for the money, it's James Taylor at his best.
0764207407|4.0|This is a bit different version as it is an Insight Edition which has notes along the margins. Trivia, notes, and inspirations to enhance the story.<br /><br />A great classic as any Jane Austen book is. I really liked the comments about the movie, the little blips about Jane Austen's life and their humorous remarks about the characters.<br /><br />It took a bit longer to read with all of these side comments, but they did enhance the story. I didn't care for the inspiration notes as they seemed to almost force the story towards God (which isn't a bad thing, but just distracting with an already true classic story).<br /><br />I liked this book overall and it'll hold a spot on my bookshelf.
B000026X5E|3.0|Let me preface by stating that I'm not a hugh Springsteen fan.  But based on the high ratings by obviously bigger fans, I got a steal on this CD (Sony/BMS Japan 2005 version) at Half Price Books for $7.  Nebraska is clearly not mainstream for a casual fan like me.  Sound quality is marginal given that it was recorded on a 4-track cassette recorder.  Lyrics are heavy, music is Bruce up close and personal (mostly accoustic).  I give a 3-star rating out of professional courtesy until this one has a chance to soak in...I wonder what kind of pizza he ordered.
0740748475|5.0|These books will provide entertainment for years to come. It is amazing how Watterson is able to  juxtapose the bliss of childhood's simplicity and thought provoking social commentary within whimsical and enjoyable stories. Having all the strips compiled makes it read almost like a long story instead of a comic strip, which is a great way to enjoy them, but it is also fun to flip to a random page and enjoy whatever pearl of wisdom Hobbes has for a frustrated Calvin.The binding has a classic kind of look that looks great on every book shelf. A must buy for any fan!
0312370849|4.0|This story is very well written.  Once you begin you won't be able to put it down till the last word is read. I didn't realize these events took place in France till I read this book.  It will keep these people in your mind for a long time to come. The event is historically true. It's a heart rendering story that will make you cry and remember and hope it won't happen to any peoples in our world again.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|As a 38 year old mother with 2 young girls (ages 5 & 7) I am used to repeatedly watching movies over and over and over...but this is one I do not tire of!  The songs are great and extremely catchy, the dialogue is fantastic with many great one liners!  I have to say, that my favorite characters are Mama Odie and Ray.  Both have great lines and LOTS of character!     This is a definite keeper!

B000002BMV|5.0|What a brilliant album this is.  Don't listen to the naysayers, some people just don't appreciate good music.  For what they were, Journey were a fantastic band.  No, they didn't write a lot of deep, heavy lyrics- but who wants deep heavy lyrics all the time?  Even the most serious of us needs some catchy, feel-good rock'n'roll sometimes- and Journey were exceptionally good at making it.  Look- you gotta love these guys and this album in particular.  The songwriting is first class, there are tons of great hooks, the musicianship is first class (most of them are jazz trained musicians) and Steve Perry had a soaring, soulful rock voice to die for.  The continuing popularity of 'Don't Stop Believin' just confirms the enduring appeal of this music, despite what some snotty, over serious critics may say.  Journey rules!
0691142165|5.0|Rogoff and Reinhart clearly were bothered by what they were seeing for years before this book appeared, so you can put them in the camp who saw it coming. The book looks at centuries of financial crises, not from the usual anecdotes about how bad it was but from a more wonkish look at what leads up to it and what often follows. In some sense the book is soothing in that we have been here before. On the other hand, this particular crisis is one of only two that were truly global. He calls this one \\"The Second Great Contraction\\" (the first, of course, referring to the great depression.)    By looking at obscure sources of data, the authors show that what we are seeing has played out before, including all the bailouts, currency pressures, sovereign stresses, and contagion. He notes that defaults are common, but domestic defaults--the defaults in which you stick up your own countrymen's butts--is relatively rare and tend to be very inflationary. He suggests that the cost will be in small part the bailouts and in large part the lost revenues; it certainly is not over with either.     I think this book represents a great service to the community and will serve as an important reference source. The typical Amazon.com reader, however, is likely to be disappointed by the lack of hyperbole and the large amount of data (which can be skipped over whenever you are feeling uninterested.) Rogoff and Reinhart, for example, certainly imply that the idiots were, well, complete idiots. They do not obsess for long over this point, holding their criticism largely to the conclusion    The fine structure--the street level events--are not included. I think, for example, that we are looking forward to sovereign defaults that are unusually focused at the local level. State and municipalities are certainly going to start putting it to people by defaulting on their promises. That may be unprecedented given the magnitude of their roles in society may be unprecedented.    Overall, I have no complaints and believe that any serious student of the crisis ought to read this book. (You can also skip Sorkin's book in my opinion if you must choose your reading materials; his is an archival view of what the crooks saw during the crisis.)    As usual, I wrote this review and subsequently took a look at the other Amazon reviews. As expected, the reviews are mixed. Those who like the details liked the book. Those who need more ready-to-serve conclusions were disappointed. Both sides make excellent points.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|This is a fascinating and moving study of authoritarianism and its dehumanising effects. Set in the pre-Glasnost days of the mid-1980s we're transported into the grubby, corrupt world of the infamous Stasi. Muhe plays a highly-respected Stasi officer given the task of spying on a playwright and his actress girlfriend. As he eavesdrops on the couple he undergoes a profound transformation. He gradually rediscovers his humanity and sets about covering-up the playwright's subversive activities. But tragedy strikes when Muhe's superior arrests the playwright's girlfriend only to set her free under conditions she cannot tolerate. Tragic consequences ensue which lead to Muhe's ignominious demotion. But, years later, when the Berlin Wall falls, his redemption is completed in a fitting tribute.
B00000ADG2|5.0|beautiful album from a such a talented and in-touch with Mother Earth lady.  Lauren Hill's place in this reality is that she is obviously an old soul and has learned over her span on earth that indignation and malice towards any human is entirely immoral an wrong.  I am confident that believes in love and the conman good of all people no matter where you are from or what you believe.  Reclusive-yes but I believe Lauren Hill wants to lead a normal life, raising her children and being a wife made possible by her commercial recording successes.  Lauren Hill is a role model for  all, (men & women)especially young women and girls as well as elderly matriarchs and women holding stature old.  Congratulations on fantastically expressive and an high quality recording... please record again soon - please.<br /><br />I'm pretty certain that a new set of songs have already been written and the artist is in the painstaking process of making it in the style of art that she sees fit to publish. Something that is being written now or in the future will only strengthen her position in society as a historical reminder and pioneer for women and women's music in the modern age.<br /><br />cheers

The fact that they still show a more polished appreciation for reggae(More)and a touch of jazz just did it for me. Get this album, you will not be sorry, it just puts you in a merry and soulful mood!
B001V7P2W2|2.0|Having read The White Spider by Heinrich Harrer and hearing the book was used in the making of the film, I was very excited to see Nord Wand and I couldn't wait for the film to be released in America. However, when I finally got the movie and the 2 hours of the film rolled by, I was disappointed.    The climbers are portrayed as competitors who hate each other and climb for glory rather than for love of climbing and love of the mountain. This is exactly the opposite of how they behave in The White Spider, which is an historically accurate account written by a man who was part of the 4-man team that climbed the Face for the first time in 1938. What was most incredible to me was how the Austrian team was shamelessly portrayed as a pair of selfish men whose lust for glory caused the tragedy of 1936, which is an outright lie that slanders two men of climbing history.    The dreary, competitive, unfriendly spirit between the climbers is the exact same mood as in The Eiger Sanction, which is a silly (but fun) Hollywood over-dramatization of alpine climbing. This is fine for a fictional piece, but for a film based on such an important event in climbing history such as this one, I would call it a travesty.    On the plus side, the technical portrayal of climbing in that period is reasonably accurate, and the film offers some visually incredible scenes high on the North Face. If you watch this movie expecting dramatization and take it as fiction, even though it is not supposed to be fiction, you will probably enjoy it. However, if you had hopes that a climbing film produced by Hollywood (or in this case its German counterpart) would finally capture the true spirit of climbing, you will be very disappointed.

Not very useful to use in classes since it's too small to show in front of a class. Not very happy with it.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I gotta say that going to see Kick-Ass last night was one of the most surprising moviegoing experiences in a long time. The trailer made it look like your typical action comedy. That said the trailers still piqued my interest. When I went to go see it, I was totally unprepared for the dark, disturbing and violent, yet extremely hilarious ride that is Kick-Ass. So as you may see, the trailers were totally misleading... in a good way. It is a bit of a shame that this was a rather underwhelming box office result; but maybe it`ll boost next weekend due to all the good word of mouth.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is NOT your typical action comedy. It is NOT this year's Pineapple Express or Inglourious Basterds. Kick-Ass is a dark, twisted, violent and and brutal fun ride through a wannabe superhero, his love interest, a superhero who's dad is part of the Mob, a superhero daddy and his daughter, and a twisted plot involving the mob. It is also totally hilarious and has the usual teen movie formula with the love interest and the protagonist's geeky friends. Those mixed together form quite possibly the best movie I've seen this year!<br /><br />Dave is a geeky, young, teen boy. He has two geeky best friends he hangs with and is totally invisible to the girls. He always has wondered what it is like to be a superhero. But moreso, the question becomes: what is a superhero without superpowers? Batman doesn't have superpowers. One day, he finds a superhero costume online and orders it, and with it soon becomes the first actual superhero: Kick-Ass. One day after getting stabbed by a hoodlum, he gets tons of metal plates installed and now he has the chops to be a superhero!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mindy (performed wonderfully by Chloe Meritz) and her daddy Damon (played by Nicolas Cage) live together and live in danger. He teaches Mindy to grow up early if the time comes where he dies and she has nobody to go to. However, they become superheroes themselves when hearing of Kick-Ass's fighting with gang members in a parking lot. As for the kid who's dad is in the mob, Chris? He becomes one too, Red Mist. But when the mob believe that Kick-Ass is killing all their members off, a war wages between the bunch and the mob, strapping the audience to their seats for one brutal and hilarious ride!<br /><br />As mentioned, Kick-Ass is just that: KICK-ASS!!!!! A stellar cast is combined with a great script and tons of brutal violence. Aaron Johnson does a great job as Dav, and does a great job at hiding his British accent. Nic Cage, someone I usually do not like is hilarious as well, his Adam West mannerisms are pure epic win in every sense. But the show stealer: Chloe Meritz!!!! She turns in a performance as tough-as-nails 12 year old Hit Girl. As for the violence, it's definitely not for the squeamish. There's a load of gore, and when the gory bits come you'll be shocked for sure. The torture scene is probably one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in a long time too. Also you may find it shocking that a 12 year old is doing most of the killing!<br /><br />This movie is definitely not for kids under 15. It is indeed very violent and disturbing and they will probably find it disturbing too. But aside from that, this is an excellent movie that is a must-see this year! You'll NOT regret it.parking lot.

B003405MF6|5.0|I'd give this CD a galaxy full of stars if that would help further my admiration and love for this man's music.  \\"Emotion & Commotion\\" is like no other Jeff Beck album ever, but what parallels it does draw are to his most beautiful work from the past, including the now classic \\"Where Were You\\", \\"Nadia\\" and \\"Two Rivers\\".<br />  To my ears, there really is very little \\"commotion\\" on this album unless you count the crunch of \\"Hammerhead\\".  Even that rocker has a full string arrangement, which makes what would normally be a bluesy riff burst with new life and depth.  Whether it's age, Beck's increasing interest in classical music, his always present desire to take guitar where nobody else has or even can, or all of the above, \\"Emotion & Commotion\\" is a stunningly beautiful piece of music.<br />  With the delicate touch and love of melody that Jeff Beck possesses, he takes the familiar and sends it into the stratosphere.  His reading of \\"Over The Rainbow\\" is absolutely gorgeous.  The remake of \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" thumps along quite nicely to balance the CD out, with great vocals by Joss Stone, who also appears on \\"There's No Other Me.\\"<br />  \\"Lilac Wine\\" is a fine torch ballad with smoky vocals courtesy of Imelda May, with Jeff's guitar always at the right place and right time.  What makes his playing so superior is his choice of notes.  One could play other notes over a similiar arrangement, but nobody would hit the right ones like Beck does.  It simply can't be improved upon.<br />  Don't let the word \\"opera\\" scare you in some reviews.  There is no operatic bellowing anywhere on this CD, much to my relief.  The appearance of opera singer Olivia Safe is background melody without the runaway vibrato you'd expect.  In fact, her contributions add a wonderful atmospheric touch to \\"Serene\\" and the CD closer \\"Elegy For Dunkirk\\".<br />  This album is so beautiful, with its orchestral arrangements and Jeff's touch, that I was near tears by its end.  My late father used to play old classical music on scratchy beat up turntables when I was a kid, and they were more or less the \\"greatest hits\\" of the classical world.  Like all forms of music, classical music can be horrendously boring, like so many symphonies over the ages, but when it was done right, it reached right into your soul.  I remember listening to \\"Clair De Lune\\" by Debussy, the closing section of Edward Grieg's \\"Morning\\" and a few others like them over and over, letting the beauty sink into my soul.  Popular music doesn't often dig that deep, and in fact almost never does.  \\"Emotion & Commotion\\" does, though.  It's truly music of the cosmos and places Jeff Beck in sole first place as the best rock guitarist ever, Hendrix included, and probably in a very close running to Chet Atkins, the best overall guitarist ever.  I'm still stunned by what I've just heard.late father used to play old classical music on scratchy beat up turntables when I was a kid, and they were more or less the \\"greatest hits\\" of the classical world.

But she seems too ditzy and fluttery to crush a person's skull.<br /><br />When an official is poisoned right in front of Baley, his suspicions are confirmed -- somebody is still murdering, and it may be linked to some touchy political subjects that Delmarre was working on. No human was close enough to kill either man, and no robot was capable of murder. With the assistance of his robot sidekick R. Daneel Olivaw, Lije Baley starts to unravel a mystery that seems to have no suspects...<br /><br />Does a world full of languid, long-lived people waited on by robots sound like paradise? It won't after \\"Naked Sun,\\" where such a civilization is enough to drive you nuts with boredom. Asimov did an excellent job with the Solarian civilization, where actually being in the same room as another person is considered an unspeakable intimacy and the world \\"children\\" is almost obscene.<br /><br />Since this is all completely foreign to Lije Bailey (who comes from overcrowded Earth), it comes across as alien to the readers as well. It also adds an enticingly weird dimension to his detective work: Bailey has to solve a mystery entirely through communication equipment, and robots keep clearing away evidence. Add some agoraphobia and solid social commentary, and you have a story that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie writing Star Wars.<br /><br />Bailey and Daneel make an excellent team -- there's Bailey's human gut feelings and intuitions into the human mind, coupled with Daneel's cool calm robot logic, and his lack of prejudices. The supporting characters are also nicely done, particularly the mildly neurotic Gladia and the nervous Gruer.<br /><br />Asimov's \\"Naked Sun\\" is a tighter, tauter mystery than \\"Caves of Steel,\\" with a bizarre civilization and a mystery that seems impossible to figure out.

B0034JKZ3G|3.0|This gorgeous movie marks Disney's return to quality 2d animation. It is a valiant effort : a visual treat with fantastic musical numbers but two weak and almost boring villains as well as a jerky story line do not help the movie's cause. At the end, it leaves you with the feeling that you have seen a beautiful movie which is missing a tiny bit of soul. However (and this is the exciting part), it bodes very well for Disney's animation future.

1594133379|5.0|I have recommended this to all of my reading friends.  I read it because my much-younger sister-in-law had a stroke in her left-brain.  I did not expect to find words so easy to read or so descriptive.  I knew the ending; still, I read this as if it were a great mystery novel.  Now, I am enjoying passages at a more leisurely pace.  Read this!
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is such a great Album. This was an excellent album to follow Toxicity, eventough in this new album, you can hear and realize SOAD exploring and adding new sounds, and to me redefining a genre of metal. Powerful and sometimes comical. With this album they definitely differentiate from any other band, with powerful riffs, excelent singing (Serj vocals are awesome, and with Davor in a more active role, specially in the following albums Hypnotize and Mesmerize he is such a great contribution). In my personal opininion this is their best album. Keep an eye on ADD, Streamline, Boom!, Pictures. And get the next albums to fully experience this great band!!
0307266303|5.0|McDougall's wonderfully presented narrative intertwined with the latest scientific discoveries on human running represents a truly valuable set of findings for runners of all levels. Yet, Born to Run's most controversial argument, Barefoot Running, has sparked a synchronized connection in thousands of injured runners, suddenly questioning the fundamental premise of the running-shoe companies \\"your feet are imperfect and only our shoes can fix them\\".     Although running-shoe establishment experts are challenging the book's findings as hype, the truth is that barely 40 years from the creation of modern running shoes, slowly but steadily the US and other western countries lost ascendancy in running competitions to countries where people grow up running barefoot. All the while, the greatest coaches, running doctors and runners themselves, blamed it on the most diverse and sometimes prejudiced arguments. Few noticed that maybe, the explanation could be as simple as \\"Running Form\\" or as expressed by the author in his blog \\"Ultimately, the debate isn't about Bare Soles vs. Shoes. It's about learning to run gently. Master that, and you can wear -- or not wear -- anything you please.\\" This is further clarified by Harvard anthropologist Daniel Lieberman (thoroughly interviewed and quoted by McDougall in the book):     \\"The reason you have to replace your shoes every 250 to 350 miles is that the shoe is taking over the job of acting like a spring, the job your muscles would normally do,\\" Lieberman says. \\"Your muscles repair themselves, but the shoe can't.\\" In a recent study, published in the journal Nature, Lieberman found that while the vast majority of shoed runners strike with their heels first, barefoot runners tend to glide across the ground, touching down on the forefoot or midsection of the foot. \\"We think until the 1970s everyone ran that way. We're pretty sure that no one heel-struck until the invention of the modern running shoe\\"     Let's hope this book becomes theflicker that revolutionizes western-world running, inspiring our sons and daughters to become the first generation of runners that truly challenge the Kenyans in future running competitions.

B003G4W49C|1.0|First, I liked the story.  There are plenty of other reviews here, I won't add to them.<br /><br />My pleasure in reading the Kindle edition, however, was ruined by an appalling lack of proofreading.  Almost every \\"ru\\" was interpreted as an \\"m\\", for example. Clearly the Kindle edition was not typeset from the original electronic text, but derived from optical character recognition from a printed page.  The publishers could have had a proofreader go through the book after this, but they didn't.  They didn't even run it through spellcheck.  No, they just went ahead and charged me $5.99 for it.<br /><br />I'd like to buy the next book in the series, but I won't.  This publisher doesn't deserve my money.  Maybe I'll borrow it from a friend or from a library.<br /><br />Amazon -- please require at least some minimal standard of proofreading for Kindle books. You owe it to your Kindle owners.<br /><br />UPDATE -- just received this from Amazon:<br /><br />We're writing about your recent Kindle purchase of Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. The version you received contained some errors that have been corrected.<br /><br />An updated version of Ender's Game is now available. It's important to note that when we send you the updated version, you will lose any highlights, your last page read, and bookmarks made in your current version and the locations of any notes may not match the updated copy of the book.<br /><br />.... so, for those of you who care about typos, it's possible you can now buy this book.  At least someone noticed the problem and tried to fix it.  When/if I read the corrected version (won't be for a while) I'll edit this review again.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: Have now read parts of the updated version and it's definitely better!  I don't guarantee that there are no typos, but I didn't find any in a quick look -- which since the older version had multiple typos on every \\"page\\" suggests that there has been a serious effort to address the problem.<br /><br />@Bookworm -- Thanks, I did also submit feedback at the time. This review was to warn Kindle owners of the problem before they made the mistake of buying it.<br /><br />@thirtyeyes -- What C.J. Schmidt said.
B000FSME1A|5.0|Any fans of this movie must have the two main versions of this film (the original release and Redux) already, so you wouldn't buy this 2-disk set for that reason. What makes this disk special are the extras. Walter Murch on Sound Design, Francis Ford on the music and narration design, and the supervising editor Richard Marks on just what goes on in those dark rooms away from the set, are all invaluable insights into filmmaking by an inspired creative team. If only DVD extras provided as much educational value as these ones. Forget the trivial self-promotion and the empty rhetoric that is the stuff of most DVD extras - buy this set if you want to hear how real creative artists work.

0071636080|5.0|[[ASIN:0823095363 Digital Art Revolution: Creating Fine Art with Photoshop]]<br /><br />As a teacher and an author, I lecture frequently. I wanted to know more about presentation structures and web-based presentations in specific. Although \\"The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\\" was not precisely relevant to my subject, it looked intriguing enough that I purchased it, in addition to a couple of books on \\"webinar\\" presentations. Of the three books I purchased, I found to my surprise that \\"The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\\" was the most valuable by far. I already thought I was pretty good at making multimedia presentations, but the information in this book has really changed the way that I think about and approach lectures and presentations. I am speaking at Cleveland's Museum of Contemporary Art in June, and reading this book literally inspired me to scrap everything and start again and my audience will benefit from it.<br /><br />Although the book lives up to its title (it is very specific in the techniques and strategies used by Steve Jobs in his presentations) I would say that Steve Jobs is more of a metaphor. The real topics of the book are passion, integrity, enthusiasm, hard work, and telling a story clearly and engagingly. It is entertaining as well as informative. Like all really good books, \\"The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\\" transcends its subject matter. A person could find value in these larger principles even if they were not a public speaker. A genuine pleasure to read.

B00003CXD5|4.0|Warners 2003 release in a 2 disc format of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is certain to please the fans of this now legendary film.Released in Jan/48 it managed to get three Academy Awards,two for John Huston as director and screenwriter and one for his father Walter Huston.Huston in the twilight of his career manages to steal the show many times over and his performance tops even that of the name star in this picture,Bogie.Not to take away too much from Bogie,it is an all around solid cast with Tim Holt as the third amigo in this tale of deceit,lust and redemption.<br />The story starts with a down and out Fred Dobbs(Bogie)stuck interminably in Tampico,Mexico.Having arrived years before working for big corporations exploiting the riches of the land he is now out of work and broke,living from hand to fist.He hits up the same man three times without realizing it as he never looks up(director Huston in a dapper white suit and panama hat).Getting enough money for a bed in a flop house he meets Bob Curtin(Holt) and an old prospector Howard(Huston).Howard talks up a storm about his prospecting days around the world while Curtin and Dobbs listen in.He claims the Sierra Madre Mountains contain a dearth of gold and wishes he could go after it.After a night of contemplation Dobbs talks Curtin into the idea of actually trying to hunt for gold and they approach Howard.Howard says it's alright with him but they're still a little short of money.Just then a small boy(cameo by Robert Blake) comes by to tell him he has won on the ticket he bought a few days before.With the money now in hand the three head into the mountains.<br />After days of trekking and climbing they reach an area that Howard says should be fine for mining.They set up their equipment,build a sluice and soon thereafter are finding what they came to seek.Dobbs slowly but surely,day after day,becomes paranoid about his partners and their intentions towards his gold.Even after Curtin saves Dobbs after a mine collapse,it still doesn't convince him of their good intentions.Several spats result and Dobbs becomes more and more withdrawn.The paranoia is set aside however when an unwelcome fourth man enters the picture asking into the operation.Before the three can carry out their decision to kill him bandidos arrive to steal from them.It's a shoot out to the death until the Federalis arrive and chase the bandidos away.The Bandidos inadvertently took care of the fourth man as he is found dead as a result of the shoot out.<br />At this point some local Indians approach the camp asking for some assistance for a sick young boy,close to death.Howard goes off with them,brings the boy back to consciousness,and returns to the group.More bickering ensues amongst the partners,much of it pressed by Dobbs,whose paranoia is now slowly rearing its' ugly head again after a brief respite.Just as the three decide to leave the area the Indians again show up wanting Howard to return to the village as an honoured guest.He does so and Dobbs and Curtin head back to await for Howard's return.Along the way Dobbs' paranoia hits a peak and he \\"kills\\" his partner.When he goes back to bury him in the morning the body is gone.He assumes he was eaten by a mounatin lion,but in reality Curtin dragged himself off to a nearby Indian village where he gets medical attention and Howard and he are reunited.He relates his sordid tale to Howard and they decide to leave and find Dobbs to reclaim their share of gold.Dobbs in the meantime has had a tough slug of it coming down the mountain and has lost one mule out of the team already.He is desperate and out of water when he finds a watering hole.As he and his team of burros quench their thirsts the bandidos from earlier happen upon him.There is no where for him to run or hide and he is killed.They steal his burros and pelts to sell but dump the gold thinking it was a red herring and just sand.When they attempt to sell their merchandise in town they are caught and the Federalis finally catch them.They are executed just as Howard and Curtin arrive.The townspeople saved the pelts for Howard and Curtin but the men inquire as to where the more important stuff is.A small boy overheard the bandidos say they dumped it in an abandoned village just outside of town.A strong wind storm is coming up and by the time they arrive all they find are empty bags.All Howard can do is laugh at the irony of it all,as do the Indians who accompanied them and finally Curtin.Curtin and Howard part with Howard going back with the Indians to live out his life and Curtin returning to the States.<br />Wonderfully acted throughout this film is certainly a classic of its' kind and still holds up well even today.Bogie gives a good performance in paranoia and an off state of mind while Huston gives a great turn as an eccentric and grizzled old prospector who has seemingly seen and done it all but still is nobodies fool.Tim Holt as Curtin is the one in the middle,the apparent more sane and grounded of the two,who has to deal constantly with both men's idiosyncrasies;like a constantly moving pendulum.The Academy awards were certainly well deserved.The novel by Travens from which this came from to my recollection was terribly socialistic.That is it came at the story from an exploitative angle of big foreign business interests that stripped the Mexicans of their well deserved resources and hired labour from all over the world cheap in order to reap big profits.To convert that into the movie took a considerable talent and Huston showed he was certainly up to the task.A shining hour in the Huston cannon.<br />Technically this two disc set has been transferred well.The blurb on the cover tells us this film was restored visually and audially and was newly transferred.Well generally the picture is good and quite clear and crisp,but there are many instances of scratch lines and wear throughout which should have been removed and weren't.I think it's about time that a new remastering be done on this film to bring it up to snuff.However being 2 discs there are plenty of extras.There are featurettes on the movies' making and Huston's career,commentary,a vintage newsreel,two cartoons a funny Joe McDoakes comedy short,galleries,the /49 Lux radio version of the movie and a trailer for Key Largo.<br />In conclusion you won't want to miss the now iconic performance from Bogie as the down and out Fred Dobbs and you cannot miss Walter Huston's Academy Award performance as the old prospector,a scene stealing turn all the way.A classic that belongs on everyone's shelf.ly catch them.They are executed just as Howard and Curtin arrive.The townspeople saved the pelts for

B001OQCV2E|1.0|I watched this movie for the special effects.  I was prepared for a juvenile script, cartoon-ish characters, bad acting and lots of nonsense.  Movies in this genre, being part morality play, have their maudlin interludes, sermons and sappy dialog, but this movie hit the \\"Pause\\" button excessively.<br /><br />The nonsense was at a level traditionally found only in parodies (example: To accommodate the lead characters, a continent moves thousands of miles at supersonic speeds and then snaps back to its original position, all with no apparent side-effects and no one else noticing).  Consequently, many of the intended thrills didn't work for me because I couldn't shift gears fast enough from laughing or shaking my head at the preposterous setups.<br /><br />One of the joys of good CGI is that you don't get taken out of the moment by disconcerting problems in the perspective, shading, motion,...--the CGI models are sophisticated enough to get the physics \\"close-enough\\".  While the CGI here was very sophisticated in its treatment of individual elements, such as crowds and the collapse of buildings, critical modeling capabilities appear to have been overridden causing the composite to be surprisingly unsophisticated, reminiscent of FX of movies in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. For example, tsunamis play a large role in the movie, but what we see is essentially the very old-fashion \\"models in a bathtub\\" version that is nothing like what we saw in videos of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or in real life experience with large bodies of water.<br /><br />TEST (relevance to you): Look at the cover art. For the background, I see a seascape with wind-whipped waves that are no more than a few feet tall.  And the amount of foam around the monastery tells me that it is a small model.  If this doesn't register with you, you may not have these problems with the FX (I have friends in this category).  On the other hand, if you notice that the monastery is much too small to dominant a mountain peak--dimensions extrapolated from it being only three stories tall--you are likely to have constant problems with the FX.<br /><br />Similarly, I was disappointed that the model for the destruction of the LA skyscrapers seemed to be largely based on deconstruction (by implosion?) rather than the more dramatic swaying, twisting and ripping that is found in models of collapses during earthquakes.<br /><br />For me, the big CGI sequence of the flight through the destruction of LA was negated by the how poorly the aircraft was pasted into the action.  First, even though the plane should have been gaining altitude after it took off from the airport, for many miles it was at or below ground level (in the chasm).  Second, the plane felt badly out-of-scale with enough of the objects that it was flying past that this destroyed the illusion. I suspect that the CGI perspective functionality was overridden to move objects to more completely fill the screen.<br /><br />The _overall_ feel of the FX is that they are quite repetitive and derivative of earlier movies.  This dilutes the effects because they are so predictable, which is further diluted by the long, boring interludes.<br /><br />In disaster movies, the thrills are delivered by visuals that build on an underlying dramatic tension.  In good disaster movies, some/many of the characters you are rooting for die, and some of the bad guys manage to elude death before eventually succumbing.  But here, there is none of that tension.  Most of the action involves the hero (Cusack) and since his survival is never in doubt, there is no sense of danger (Watch the ground failure chase Cusack. It's gaining on him! Uh oh, it's gotten ahead! But he manages to jump to safety at the last moment! Hurray! Interlude.  Repeat).<br /><br />And for the other characters, the movie almost immediately telegraphs who will die, and they obligingly die on schedule.  Plus the movie generated absolutely no investment in any of the characters.lated from it being only three stories tall--you are likely to have constant problems with the FX.

B000OONQ9O|5.0|Insanely enjoyable movie.  Depicts all the grit of Late 70's early 80's New York City.  The gangs might seem a little cheesy by todays standards but that doesn't bother me at all.  Walter Hill chooses all of these arty shots that would be amazing photographs standing alone, but the action evolves from within in those scenes.      Incredible depiction of New York City for all of its hardcore, raw, griminess.    Get this Movie!

From the Zombies to the Dog even his location in the U.S.  It's deep and enlightened.  My only issue is that the main story is only half of the book and the rest are short stories that don't even pale in comparison.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Bad acting (or maybe it was the writing?).  No, it was the acting AND the writing.  Repetitive and predictable action sequences.  The characters were a hodgepodge of every cliche you can imagine - separated couple with exactly 2.0 kids (one boy, one girl);  the mom's boyfriend who is more or less doomed from the start (did I mention the movie was predictable?);  a black president who is a widower and his hot Dr. Daughter, who hooks up with the scientist;  an evil Russian tycoon and his twin brat children;  the hippie conspiracy theorist;  the Tibetan monk . . . . blah blah blah.  I mean they didn't miss one stereotype.  The characters were so thin, when they turned sideways they disappeared.

B002VPE1B6|4.0|It is crazy that people use this forum to rate the movie and not the product. You are rating the BR/DVD not what is on it. I don't care if you think it is a remake of another movie format(at least it has somewhat better dialog that the newer Star Wars trilogy) or if you think the 'production values' were lacking. Get a clue, people coming to this site most likely have seen and already want this movie and could care less about what disappointed some stranger about this flick.     While it's somewhat valuable to know if another BR is coming out with additional scenes I'm kind of unmoved by that too when it comes to the initial purchase. It's kind of refreshing to get just the movie that you watched and liked enough to order a copy for your home. So many BR/DVD packages come with so much extra junk (interviews I've already seen on other shows/cheap games/deleted scenes that should have stayed on the cutting room floor)that it's nice to see one put out with a more 'zen' approach.     I give it 4 stars b/c it is the movie I saw and it was fun to watch, period. Yeah, I could get this a little cheaper at best buy and get just the BR for $22 (I still don't get why they package both together) but with a drive there and back and tax I might as well just order it here.
B001CDLATE|3.0|5 Star Chronos New age IMAX still cutting edge today.   3 Star Baraka Too weird to handle.     This is the same review I'm combining for the comparison of both Chronos and Baraka.     CHRONOS & BARAKA  These programs are visual displays of majestic landmarks, people, cultures, and wonders of the world.  If you want to watch TV, but don't feel like watching TV, these are the way to go.  No thinking, no storyline, just relax and let your imagination go.  It's a revolutionary new age type of artistic display.  It can be watched repeatedly without boredom, like a music CD.    BARAKA  As far as the content of Baraka, the major problem I have are those bizarre African tribe ritual scenes.  Not that there's anything wrong with this, but I'd much rather see this in a documentary, with a narrator describing this cultural meaning.  Ie, teach me. OK, I see the point of Baraka is appreciation of art, but without the explanation, these weird clips leave me in a state of mysterious void of confusion. Perhaps Baraka should have a 2nd audio channel or subtitle. Same goes with the shots of homeless people and inner city trash: BORING, and disgusting.  Homeless and trash on 1080p is not art.    CHRONOS  Chronos is Baraka minus the weird tribal rituals.  Chronos is 100% sheer art in its original Ron Flicke form. Every scene, second, and breath has power, deep thoughts and emotions attached to it, can be watch numerously, anytime.  Chronos blu ray also includes 3 invaluable features not on Baraka.  1) Global location pop up, 2) Annotations pop up of detailed features of each location, and 3) Director's audio commentary.    I give Chronos blu ray 5 star, and Baraka blu ray 3 stars.
B001FB55L2|5.0|PTSD or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is one of the many demons that our military men and women on tour through OEF/OIF are having to endure.  This movie truly captures what a family struggles through when one is sent to war, endures the horrors of war, and survives (so it seems) and comes back as a human shell.  Toby McGuire does a commendable job of portraying the mental anguish that goes along with PTSD and the way it affects close and family relationships.<br /><br />The viewer gets to see a family trying to stay together through loss at home while a young Marine in Afghanistan goes through the trials and tribulations of war.  The movie does a nice job of portraying both sides of the story and keeping the viewer in it's grips.  This is not a story about one brother cheating on another (although the trailer would make it seem as such), it is more about the broken person that emerges from war and tries to put pieces back together.<br /><br />A very good and touching film.  I enjoyed it a lot and expect to be watching it several times to grab the things I may have missed.<br /><br />Recommended!
B00284BNKC|5.0|This is a not a review of the movie, we know how great it is already, but of the blu ray transfer.  I did side by side comparison, and blu ray is absolutely stunning improvement from upscaled dvd (w/ HDMI).  The extras/bonuses from the dvd are same on blu ray.  However, I was more used to the menu layout in the dvd, hence I'm keeping both copies.    Dreaming of this flick?  Definitely a Requiem for blu ray copy.
B0039UTDA6|3.0|Wow! People are WAY more negative about the Oprah version than I think is fair. Not even a dull narration can take away from the amazing footage in this series, and I don't feel it's a waste of my time to watch it on my DVR. It is still interesting, and I don't think Oprah takes away from the fascinating scenes that are unfolding on the screen. Personally, I think the footage is so amazing that nothing can really detract TOO much from it. However, having said that, she definitely comes across as being slightly bored with her subject matter, which makes it slightly boring for people to listen to, especially in contrast with Sigourney Weaver's version of Planet Earth, which I thought was quite excellent. I won't waste my money actually BUYING this version of the series.    If you want the BEST version of any of the Discovery Channel documentaries, David Attenborough's versions definitely enhance everything he narrates and is head and shoulders above anything else, especially in this case, since they also altered the narration for Oprah's sake. I agree with all the people who said they don't understand why they feel the need to recruit an American narrator for these shows, when David Attenborough is so thoroughly beloved by American audiences as well as British. In the case of Planet Earth, it worked and was pretty wonderful with either narrator. But in the case of Life, the narration is definitely not as smart and well-done as it could be, and I would highly recommend purchasing the Attenborough version over this one. I'm not an Oprah fan, but I believe in giving credit where it's due, and she does an adequate job here. The problem is that there is an EXCELLENT alternative for comparison, and this one doesn't hold up when stacked against it. Don't waste your money on this cheap knockoff version!
B001GMH8TM|5.0|This is a not a review of the movie, we know how great it is already, but of the blu ray transfer.  I did side by side comparison, and blu ray is a noticeable improvement from upscaled dvd (w/ HDMI), and well worth the upgrade.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|This is a really good movie.  Great for the family.  My husband and I enjoyed as much as our 2 year old!!!
B000MCH5TK|5.0|This is a not a review of the movie, we know how great it is, but of the blu ray transfer.  I did side by side comparison, and blu ray is not such a noticeable improvement from upscaled dvd (w/ HDMI).  Blu ray just seems grainier and harsher.  If you already have the DVD, save yourself $20.    {{{I see my review above has not been helpful.  Hence, addendum 05/03/10 below to provide more edification.}}}    The manner in which the analysis was conducted was as follows.  The time is at night, (room darkened), but w/ recessed lights graded barely hued to simulate subtle twilight.  Several different scenes were chosen to allow a spread of variety: bright, dark, and fast motion scenes.     The medium used are as follows: 65\\" Panasonic 1080p Plasma S Series, TC-P65S1, with 2 Panasonic DMP-BD60 blu ray players side by side running subsequently synchronized w/ the TV inputs alternating between the two HDMI cables.  The picture mode is at standard settings, not vivid.  All specs pre-calibrated w/ Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics [Blu-ray] at the time of TV installation.  With my glasses, I have 20/20 vision.    The Babel blu ray has been released 2 separate times, on June 3, 2008; then the reprint on December 16, 2008.  For your clarification, I will include the ASIN # of the one I received from Amazon: B000MCH5TK.    This same pattern of consistent comparison is done as I receive each of my newly ordered blu rays replacing my dvd's.  In my current collection, vast stunning jaw dropping improvements have been seen in the following blu ray: Requiem for a Dream, Planet Earth, Jackal, Chronos, and Heathers.  However, only subtle improvements were seen in Phantom of the Opera, Juno, Universe Seasons 1-4, and Truman Show.  Disappointing, little or no improvement were seen in Babel, March of the Penguins, and My Cousin Vinny.  My goal here is to inform, contribute reviews, and save you guys time & $.
0307269965|3.0|BRIDESHEAD REVISTED begins with a friendship that Charles Ryder, this novel's snobbish protagonist, establishes with Sebastian Flyte, the son of a wealthy Catholic family and the owners of Brideshead, a beautiful country estate. This friendship begins when Ryder is a fresher at Oxford:<br /><br />\\"I knew Sebastian by sight long before I met him. That was unavoidable for, from his first week, he was the most conspicuous man of his year by reason of his beauty, which was arresting...\\" And: \\"He was entrancing, with that epicene beauty which in extreme youth sings aloud for love...\\"<br /><br />Between their first and second years at Oxford, Charles accompanies Sebastian to Venice, where they stay with Sebastian's father and his mistress. She observes: \\"I know of these romantic friendships of the English and the Germans.... I think they are very good if they do not go on too long... In England it comes when you are almost men; I think I like that. It is better to have that kind of love for another boy than for a girl. Alex [Sebastian's father], you see, had it for a girl, for his wife...\\"<br /><br />To the contemporary sensibility, Waugh begins BR by establishing a gay relationship between Charles and Sebastian. But then what happens? Instead of keeping his focus on this issue, Waugh expands the interests of the haughty Charles from Sebastian to the entire Flyte/Marchmain family, their old money heritage, and his sister Julia, who must find a suitable husband.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Waugh appends to Sebastian the problem of alcoholism. This certainly gives Waugh something to write about. But, as presented, this problem doesn't really explore Sebastian's character. Instead, it allows Waugh to follow Sebastian's plight over 20 years while downplaying his sexual orientation. BR, in other words, seems to address manufactured, not character-driven, themes. It lacks the courage to explore its content.<br /><br />This failure to confront content is also apparent in Waugh's treatment of Sebastian's family. Here, the pompous Charles believes that the Flyte/Marchmain family represents something great and discerning, as well as superior to commercial work-a-day England. Illustrating this are Charles's observations about Lady Marchmain's brothers, who died in World War I. \\"These men must die to make a world for Hooper [a feckless enlisted man reporting to Charles in the prologue and epilogue]; they were the aborigines, vermin by right of law, to be shot off at leisure so that things might be safe for the traveling salesman, with his polygonal pince-nez, his fat wet handshake, his grinning dentures.\\"<br /><br />But, in fact, the men of the wealthy Flyte/Marchmain clan are simply spoiled and useless twits, uninterested in finding meaningful roles in life. At the same time, the issue in the life of Julia is the standard female problem of finding the right man. What Waugh tries to do in BR is to endow these very limited characters with historic dimension. But, the only quality about this family that is other than mediocre is its wealth. IMO, Waugh, through his protagonist Charles, can't see the true dynamic of his characters because he is a captivated by their money. Again, he doesn't truly confront his content.<br /><br />Certainly, Catholicism plays a big role in Book III of BR. But you know what? Once again, this subject feels like something Waugh appended to his narrative so there was something to write about. Will Lord Marchmain accept the sacrament on his death bed? Will Julia acknowledge her core Catholicism? These are matters that come up in the conclusion of BR. But these aren't emblematic of issues that Waugh has explored throughout his novel. Instead, Catholicism functions as a layer of melodrama that Waugh has added to a bizarre book, where the emotional engine of the narrative diverts from its story.ompous Charles believes that the Flyte/Marchmain family represents something great and discerning, as well as superior to commercial work-a-day England.

B005C9YZIW|5.0|Taking a complicated order for a simple burger involves smorgasbord of holding this or extras on that when it comes to every tailored garnish? Well, here's the scoop on this 6-disc Special Edition blu-ray set, as the problem with distributors setting the final cut allows no a la carte freedom to pick and chose extras. After all, this IS another chance for distributors to double dip, like in any industry, music, movies, etc. a genealogy of remakes, re-mix edits, extended edition, director's cut, previously unreleased bonuses tracks, re-master, new cover art, all in the name of gouging consumers. Especially with blockbusters, and Planet Earth (PE) is no exception. Yes folks, as long as you buy into it, you've suckered up into their marketing ploy. It was all in their strategies from the very start. After all, companies hire a panel full time solely dedicated to all the nitty-gritty tactical ways in capitalizing the bottom line of $, every chance they get, AKA milking the system. What can you do? Really nothing. You are at their helm when the goods are dangled to you in tantalization, and your pavlovian response is beyond your control. But I'm sure as you're reading this, you're wondering if this set is worth it. So without further a due, let's see what you get, and whether or not you can beat the system to your advantage.<br /><br />So here's the 411 scoop of accompaniments NEW to this 6-disc 2012 BD set that's NOT on the 2007 4-disc BD set, listed in the order of importance:<br /><br />1) Diaries (bonus in disc 1-4), the 10-min making of clip following each of the 11 main features. Total of ~107 min in SD. Worthy to note, unlike the DVD version and other BBC nature diaries, which auto-plays the diaries immediately following the credits, here you do need to navigate back to the main menu to select these bonuses.<br /><br />2) 3 new bonus documentaries (disc 6), total 150 min's:<br />a) Snow Leopards: Beyond the Myth 50 min in HD<br />b) Secrets of Maya Underworld 50 min in SD<br />c) Elephant Nomads of the Namib Desert 50 min in SD<br />-Note: the UK version contains Natural World - Desert Lions 50 min. Not sure why US version left this out. But lucky for US version, UK left out Maya Underworld and Elephants Nomads.<br /><br />3) The Future (disc 5), 3 episodes in SD; total 3 hours:<br />a) Saving Species 60 min<br />b) Into the Wilderness 60 min<br />c) Living Together 60 min<br /><br />4) Great PE moments (disc 4) 46 min in SD, narrated by Sir David the Great Attenborough himself.<br /><br />5) Audio commentaries by producers, but only for 5 of the 11 main episodes: Pole to Pole, Mountains, Caves, Great Plains, Shallow Seas.<br /><br />6) Music only viewing audio. This feature is a bust. Why in the world would you ever watch a documentary without a narrator? BTW, it's not really music only. The sound effects (water falling, animal sounds, etc.) are still tracked in. I guess they couldn't get rid of that. In my opinion any upgrade to the audio portion should have been to include the Sigourney Weaver (Discovery version) narration.<br /><br />7) Sneak Peak at Frozen Planet (disc 6) 13 min's in HD. Oh great, more advertising :(. But this IS BBC's next big release following the Life and Human Planet series.<br /><br />Technical issue: the transfer is 1080i. From my research regarding the ad nauseam debate of PE being i or p, the original cameras used to film this series were no better than 1080i, so that's the limiting step. Though some earlier 2007 BD packages states 1080p, and the signal to your TV indicates p, later releases of the 2007 version corrected this to say 1080i on the package. Considering this series was filmed over the course of the early 2000's, you really can't notch about this (it was the best they had then). The main feature is still reference quality by 2012 standards.  However, regarding the extras, for the most part, ALL the bonus features (with the exception of Snow Leopard and the Sneak Peak Frozen Planet which are clearly HD) are all in SD, and at best, an upscaled 720 clearly not full HD from my sharp 20/20 on my 65\\" panny.<br /><br />So back to the title of my review, can you beat the system to your advantage? Well, I'll tell you what I did. Ordered used (much cheaper, note: got mine for $22), tossed out the scarfed package (it's cheap cardboard anyways).  Bought a 6 disc blu-ray case (brand viva elite) for $2.50 from casetopia dot com, which BTW is the exact same size as the 4 disc case (15 mm thickness). Fit's perfectly into your old slip case. Successful upgrade. Donated the old version to a friend. Done.<br /><br />Ultimately it's up to you, the well informed consumer to flip the switch or say screw you Mr. distributor leech. Everyone's economics and shelf space run the gamut to savvy your rations, like those must have fan boys. Still not sure?, here a logical final decision making:<br /><br />-If you have both the dvd and original 2007 BD versions, no real need to upgrade unless you really need the bonus of Elephant Nomads.<br />-If you only have the Discovery US version of Sigourney Weaver narrating and want the original David Attenborough, then go for it.<br />-If you don't have the dvd version but only have original 2007 BD version, your upgrade will be solely for all those bonus extras, but keep in mind those extras are in standard def.<br />-If you don't have any copies of PE, this is a must own in every household for all ages. Starting with this Special Edition 6-disc version, you'd be skipping all other previous wasted versions.<br />-When it comes to double dipping, price of course is always an issue. Currently as of this writing, the price on Amazon is as follows: Amaz $35; MarketPlace $33; used $26.<br /><br />To top it off, a globe limited edition (gift version) is also available. Contains the same materials, just the hardware/ packaging is different, [[ASIN:B005C9YZKU Planet Earth: Limited Edition [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />Good luck PE fans. Hope thishelps. Note: this updated PE review is written on 01/21/12.
0385523386|5.0|Not that long ago, I got cuffed COPS-style and it completely freaked me out--my wrists ended up bloodied and bruised. I grew up in a WASPy middle-class environment in a suburb in Massachusetts. In 1991, I graduated from Simmons College, a small women's college in Boston. Piper Kerman graduated from one of the Seven Sisters-- Smith College-- at around the same time. That's where the similarities between my life and Piper's life end. In 1992, I drove across the United States with a friend from my days as a competitive equestrian. While I visited San Diego, Las Vegas and Bryce Canyon, Piper hung out in Bali with drug runners and carried drug money to Brussels.<br /><br />A decade later, Piper's criminal past, which she had long left behind, caught up with her. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed, well-educated Piper found herself in lock-up for a felony. Sentenced to 14 months in the women's correctional facility in Danbury, Conn. Piper chronicles every detail in this candid and reflective memoir.<br /><br />Only 30 pages in, when Piper surrenders to the women's prison in Danbury, Conn., I find my own heart racing as she describes the process so vividly. I would have had a major panic attack and passed out. Piper remains relatively composed as her fiance dropped her at the door. Piper decides from the get-go that she needed to be brave, even if she just puts on a brave face. If she didn't remain in that state of mind she felt that she'd be doomed to harassment and not getting through her sentence unscathed both emotionally and physically.<br /><br />When Piper first arrives she immediately notices the tribal system where many women tend to \\"stick\\" to their own--blacks with blacks; Latinos with Latinos; whites with whites and so-forth. Over time, Piper has friends of every color and more importantly, these women accept her. [It was all very West Side Story--stick to your own kind, Maria!] Piper ends up in B Dorm aka \\"The Ghetto.\\"<br /><br />In Orange is the New Black, Piper provides the real scoop on good prison guards vs. bad. She details earning various privileges like using the phone and procuring special items from the commissary. Then there's smuggling choice food from the cafeteria in the front of one's underwear for cooking up later. There's a plethora of protocols and methods to avoid trouble or privileges revoked. Piper recalls work duties. First she works in the electrical area and learns many tricks. Then she moves on to construction which allows her a bit more freedom and some fresh air. A true respite for her. Then there are a few prisoners who make passes at Piper which she manages to ward off, avoiding any insults.<br /><br />It's not all completely terrible despite being locked up. Piper slowly makes a close posse of friends on the inside. She reads a ton and has so many books that she lends them out to various inmates. To avoid stress, Piper runs on an outside track six miles a day and longer on the weekends. She also starts yoga classes with a vegetarian known as Yoga Janet. Piper gets hooked and finds it's a great stress-reducer and a chance for personal reflection. Things also aren't all rosy. There are many times when Piper falls into despair and retreats to her bunk to read or runs around and around and around the track to escape into NPR or a college radio station.<br /><br />Piper touches on several controversial subjects including incarceration of non-violent drug offenders. I agree with her on this one. It's similar to arresting the prostitutes by not the johns. Or pimps for that matter. One Dominican lady in her 70s was in for four years for a \\"wire charge\\": she took phone messages for her drug-dealing relative.<br /><br />She discusses restorative justice as a result of reflecting on what she had done and some of the women she befriended in prison-- \\"But our current criminal justice system has no provision for restorative justice, in which an offender confronts the damage they have done and tries to make it right to the people they have harmed.\\" Many who itch to return to the streets go right back to the drugs that got them locked up. The Bureau of Prisons [BOP] lacks the basic ability, funding and time to rehabilitate the incarcerated and thus the recidivism to commit the same crimes once released remains real. Some women turn to bad behavior as a coping mechanism against their poverty, lack of family support, abusive spouse and boyfriends and general hopelessness. She also talks candidly about her shock that very little is done for the women who've completed sentences and have no resources for release: reuniting with children and family members, finding housing and finding employment.<br /><br />Piper's story is at times upsetting and at other times amusing. She's a courageous woman and the memoir is a gift to readers and an inspiration. Its truth will open your eyes to unfair treatment, lack of rehabilitation and repeated frustrations within the U.S. prison system. Orange is the New Black  is at turns daunting, authentic, provocative and spellbinding. The best part is that it's about women from all different backgrounds bonding to endure a miserable situation.ght to the people they have harmed.\\" Many who itch to return to the streets go right back to the drugs that got them locked up.

B0026OE2O8|4.0|The stunning aerial shots of earth are just breath taking, sheer beauty, jaw dropping, especially in 1080p, makes BBC's Planet Earth look like an archive.  The pelican shot, and the small bird flying over the massive waterfall are just priceless.      However, the never ending depressing narration (Glenn Close) on how we are destroying our planet is like forcing me to eat tarnished caviar.  Multiple times she repeats, \\"faster, and faster, we are destroying our home earth.\\"  Sure there's light at the end of the movie, like the last 5 minutes worth, but sitting thru to get there made me rather hang myself.  Solution: just cut out the audio, and play your favorite classical tunes is an ideal substitute.  Rejoice, our Home is always awesome.  If you did actually like the audio propaganda, you may also like The Inconvenient Truth (Al Gore), which BTW is better narrated.
B002VECMAO|2.0|The movie is decent. This review is for the purchase here at Amazon. I make it a practice to only buy Blu-Rays on sale or with digital copies. That's because I have a massive library on Apple TV (and now on iPad) that my family uses to watch movies in our family room (when not in the home theater). So why on earth would a studio release a digital copy that only works on either Mac or PC??!!  And why isn't this CLEARLY disclosed since this exclusivity is the exception, not the rule??!!  I now have a useless wmv that won't play on Mac or iTunes.  I would never have purchased this if this was clear. No wonder people resort to piracy. Only buy this if you don't care about digital copies or are PC only.
B001LF347E|5.0|I just found this series a few weeks ago on the Scyfi channel. The whole day was spent showing all the season 1 episodes but i only caught the last 4. I am now watching season 2 and I love it.  It reminds me alot of Smallville which I also just recently discovered in the last year and had to go out and buy all of the seasons on DVD and Blu Ray.  This is such a good show especially considering all the stupid crap thats on TV these days. I hope the BBC continues to make the series and I hope the SciFy channel continues to show it here in the US.
1401216676|4.0|I really love this story, and the work they did recoloring it is amazing, it looks gorgeous.  It reads with that certain Alan Moore style and is one of the best stories I've read for the Jokers.  It's definitely the best single issue story of the Joker.  The only downside is: it's one 45 page comic bound in hardcover with some extra crap for $[...].  You can get the same story in DC Tales of Alan Moore without the redone artwork.  I'd recommend going that route if you're interested in the other stories by him, if you truly want just this book I'd say go for it, you're likely to re-read it enough times to make the cost worth it.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|Pardon my French in the title, but Manu mixes up languages and styles so fluently, by the end of the album you're singing along in at least two languages.  It's hard to categorize just what kind of music this is, but it's certainly rhythmic, melodic, piles of fun, distinct, unique, fresh and new, polyrhythmic, international, tuneful, immediate, sensational, stimulating, irresistable and super enjoyable.  I LOVE this music.    If you liked Clandestino but wished it went on longer, here's your fix:  much more of the same.  Even better, if that's possible.  If you don't have Clandestino, then order it today.    If you want to dance to a new beat, here you go. Or music to do almost anything to, be it dancing, driving, cooking, working out, painting the house -- it goes perfectly.      If I go on, I'll just gush some more.  So I'll sum it up:  This is a must-have album.  Enjoy.
0061537934|5.0|I enjoy dogs and auto racing, and when a friend recommended this to me, it sounded like something right down my alley. It was.    The dog tells a great tale!    I have recommended this book to several more people and no one was disappointed.
B000002H92|3.0|Combining the original \\"Absolutely Live\\" concert set with a pair of 1980s live albums, \\"Alive, She Cried\\" and \\"At the Hollywood Bowl,\\" wasn't a terrible idea in concept---unless you heard each in its own time and realised there were almost two identities of Doors presented. The Doors of \\"Absolutely Live\\" were clearly enough knobbled by Jim Morrison's increasing dissolution and legal troubles; the Doors of \\"Alive, She Cried\\" and \\"At the Hollywood Bowl,\\" by contrast, were a tightly expensive quartet who knew when to keep their troubled (and often troubling) frontman in check and when to let him have at whatever struck him in the moment.    They were never less than remarkable---and underrated (especially guitarist Robby Krieger, maybe the best unappreciated guitarist of the late 1960s and probably most eras)---musicians individually, and they get to shine in various places over those two sets. So does Morrison when he has the voice and leaves the bull behind. When he reads a verse from \\"Texas Radio and the Big Beat\\" over a slow, almost foreboding rhythm section, as a prelude to a bristling \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" he's almost everything his most stubborn admirers insist him to have been, the transcendent rock poet. He's in better voice on the \\"Alive, She Cried\\" and \\"Hollywood Bowl\\" material than he was for the \\"Absolutely Live\\" performances, to the point where his well-recorded, rising disdain for the machinery of rock and roll seemed incapable to obstructing him from delivering the goods. The soundcheck performance of Van Morrison's \\"Gloria\\" is a treat---for once the Doors are just a tight rock and roll quartet and not trying to live up to an image actual or impossible. The concert renditions of \\"Light My Fire\\" (where Manzarek and Krieger really wear their jazz influences on their sleeves during their solos), \\"You Make Me Real\\" (a far more powerful Otis Redding tribute than the ill-conceived \\"Running Blue\\"), and (especially) \\"Moonlight Drive\\" (with Morrison wringing every nuance from the lyric and Krieger outperforming his original with a shuddering, soaring round of slide guitar) are almost as revelatory as the studio originals.     \\"Absolutely Live\\" remains as problematic now as when it appeared in 1970---for every lively and committed performance (their cover of Bo Diddley's \\"Who Do You Love\\"; the eerie \\"Universal Mind,\\" no studio version of which has ever surfaced so far as I know; the playful \\"Build Me a Woman\\"), there are several spotty ones. \\"The Celebration of the Lizard\\" was always better as a concept (and, inside the gatefold sleeve of their third album, \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" a medley of poems) than as an execution even if you agree that their studio extract, \\"Not to Touch the Earth,\\" was probably the highlight of the experiment. Morrison almost sounds as though he's given up on the piece (of which they tried and failed to secure a workable recording) and the band behind him doesn't seem completely comfortable with it. They've performed \\"When the Music's Over\\" with far more commitment and better instrumental solos than they do here, though it does still include the jarring interruption of Morrison bellowing at the crowd to shuddup! during the song's quiet passage. They should have known better trying to knit together the opening exhortation from \\"The Soft Parade\\" and the useless \\"Dead Cats, Dead Rats\\" to \\"Break on Through,\\" and as it is the Doors did what was once thought impossible with their first album's kickoff song---they play it as though under sheer exhaustion. And \\"Soul Kitchen,\\" one of their debut album's best selections, seems very lacking in soul and very abundant in slogging.    If this (you can call it the best and the worst of the Doors in concert) is the only way to get the performances of \\"Alive, She Cried\\" and \\"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\" anymore, so be it. The surviving Doors themselves have been raiding their vaults of late for concert sets that do what \\"Absolutely Live\\" was supposed to do. The presence of those sets only amplifies that there were reasons \\"Absolutely Live\\" hit the cutout bins as fast as it did back in the year, reasons having less to do with the popularity (and image-softening, to an extent) of the \\"13\\" greatest-hits collection than Doors analysts believe. The sets are pricey but if you love the Doors the prices are worth it.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This movie is an amazing example of what sci-fi was meant to be. If they could have restrained themselves from cluttering it up with profanity it would have been the perfect example. It would be a yard stick for other sci-fi movies to measure by. Sadly Hollywood doesn't know how to make a movie without bad language. That's another issue however.    The issue is that this movie is awsome and yet there are so many that feel they must spew insults at anything that doesn't fit their own skewed idea of perfection that it makes me sick. I guess it needed full nude sex scenes followed by the graphic beheading of the lovers inside flaming buildings by alien bugs to get past the jaded video gaming eyes of the detractors. No room left in those heads for a good story huh? Sad. For the rest of you, if you can stand the language the movie is one of the best. Now, where did I put my tv guardian....
B002ZHKZEM|4.0|It's always a pleasure to travel with The Doctor. Some of the journeys are more exciting than others. THE WATERS OF MARS was one of the best Doctor Who episodes, preposterous and very tense. It was terrific to see Lindsay Duncan. I look forward to The doctor's latest incarnation.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I became a browncoat long after the series had been canceled at a series of theater presentations of episodes. After getting a copy of Serenity, I resisted picking up the series, but am very glad that I did.
1416550550|3.0|I was very excited to start this book, but almost didn't finish it. The first 300 pages were very tedious -- two many different story lines and people to remember. I enjoyed the last 250 pages. The book was very predictable. I'm glad I finished it, but I would not recommend it to most of my friends.

1416550550|5.0|Some reviewers seemed to think it was too long, but personally I am glad for the length because I loved every page.  The plot was interesting, but to me the beauty of this book - of Kate Morton's writing - is really in the subtleties.
B00328G4V6|5.0|I am a fan, so hearing any new stuff, it will be hard for me to be objective.  But this is nice stuff.    This version of Stone Free has a groove in it that that was not in earlier versions.  That groove follows the rest of the album.  The title track, Ships Passing in the Night, especially have the push that you love when you are looking to dance and be cool at the same time.    I like the mix.  It doesn't have the same sound as Experienced, for instance.  The tracks are not perfect.  Instead you get more of a feeling of being in the room with the band.
014241543X|4.0|I went to the BookTeenCon in Houston earlier this month.   To my delight, I met Gayle Forman and picked up a little book called If I Stay.  Let me let you all know something about me.  My brother died suddenly from a heart attack two years ago.  It was devastating, so I know firsthand how much it hurts to lose a loved one so quickly.  Death is painful.  Maybe that is why I cried so much while reading this book.  It was just painful with a touch of hope.  I wish I had the hope that Mia's family and friends have.    Mia, 17, has a boyfriend who is her true love.  She loves her family (really!).  They aren't the typical straight laced American pie, cookie cutter family either.  They are happy together and are cool without having to try.  However, one afternoon, as the family heads out for a fun day together, tragedy hits and Mia is faced with a tough, heart wrenching decision.     It really is a simple story, one that brings out such emotions in characters and readers.  Forman describes her characters with such truth; I would swear they were real.  This book is a wonderful one, with a heart wrenching story and an ending that will make you scream for more!!    I give if I stay 4.5 STACKS    Sending STACK love your way, Shannan    for more reviews: girlsinthestacks
0393072231|4.0|There is now a fully blown cottage industry producing books on the subprime crisis.  I read many of them, and this book by Michael Lewis provides an interesting uncovered angle of a bunch of individuals who risked their financial livelihood betting against subprime mortages.  It's easy to look back and say things were obvious, but it really wasn't.  It was very difficult time for these funds that went against the grain.    If you read this book, \\"The Greatest Trade\\" and \\"Too Big to Fail\\", you will have a very good coverage of what happened.     I think Michael Lewis is a gifted writer.  This book feels as if he was pressured for time, so it's not one of his better written pieces.  But still it's far better than what 99% of writers could do.
0684135051|5.0|This is a classic and a must have for all serious knitters. I can't believe it took me so long to purchase it.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|Absolutely great CD to just relax to or pump it up on the weekend. Probably will be in my CD player the whole entire summer!
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Watched the bluray as well as dvd ( just 10 minutes ) the PQ/AQ are very very good. Didnt watch it in theatre so I enjoyed it very much. The movie is in full screen format ( similar to Imax scenes in Dark Knight & Transformers 2)  There are no black bars on top & bottom. This movie is made for 3D so a 3d version would have been preferable.But fine next year when 3d Bluray comes out will watch again. The jungle & outdoor scenes particularly  are just superb in Bluray. You would like to watch it again & again.
B00164KYV4|5.0|He's Just Not That Into You is a cute and refreshing romantic comedy. Jennifer Connelly, Jennifer Aniston, and Ginnifer Goodwin make this film worth watching.

0385341008|5.0|In 1946, a London writer strikes up a correspondence with a group of friends on Guernsey, an island in the English Channel occupied by German forces during the war, and soon becomes so interested in their lives, she arrives to spend time gathering their stories and hoping to write a book about the people and how they coped during the war. (One way was to send the children to England and pray they could keep them safe.) It's a lovely story with a wide variety of characters, nearly all with memories of the woman who invented the literary society on the spot when the group was caught out too late one night by the Germans. This woman when imprisoned left behind a small, very interesting little girl who captures the writer's heart as does the Island and its residents, and a legacy of bravery and goodness we should all aspire to, although one must realize bravery and goodness is not without risk, as she knew all too well. The story may seem to be a bit slow going at first, but it's not long before the reader is captured and might well read deep into the night.<br />Eunice boeve, author of Ride a Shadowed Trail
B00275EGWY|1.0|I knew in advance that there would be serious technical flaws in this movie, but I did expect a great movie given the hype and the statue.  I just saw nothing particularly redeeming other than the quality of the filming, set dressing, and effects.      Where to start?  The lead character is both unlikeable and unsympathetic.  Those characteristics by themselves would not be such a problem if he wasn't also so unrealistic.  Tom Cruise as Maverick in Top Gun was more believable as a Naval Aviator - and that is saying something.    The story is just not that interesting.  Action substitutes for plot.    Finally the technical aspects stink.  The closest thing to realistic EOD was the opening sequence.  Real EOD techs are cautious by nature, they have to be.  They rarely \\"cut the red wire\\", preferring to BIP (Blow in Place) an explosive especially an IED.  Some dramatic license is expected in a Hollywood effort, but at least a nod to reality is expected.
0553381687|5.0|It is everything that everyone says it is. If you heard that it was too long, he spends too much time developing characters and moving peices into place, or that he is the American Tolkien. If you heard that it is very intelligent writing, more like a chess game than tic-tac-toe. If you heard that even though the series of four books (so far) are nearly four thousand pages, you'll wish they never ended because of how emotionally invested you'll become in the story. Or if you heard that Martin's unbashful approach to story-telling will make the reading experience seem historically surreal and highly unpredictable. If you heard that this may be the the best major fantasy series over the last two decades?  Then yes, you heard correctly; it is everything that everyone says it is...and more!
079284131X|5.0|How can anyone be afraid of Chucky. He's like a sweet little Disney muppet. Of course the little guy tends to get into mischieve from time to time but we all do.<br /><br />\\"Child's Play\\" is probably the best movie from the long-running series of films because it's so funny and over-the-top. Every scene is almost like a satire of an '80s slasher.<br /><br />The movie includes a long list of very talented actors, including Catherine Hicks (Mrs. Barclay), Chris Sarandon (Detective Norris), Alex Vincent (Andy) and Dinah Manoff (as Maggie). And Brad Dourif is everyone's favorite doll, Chucky.<br /><br />There are so many funny scenes in this film. I think the funniest has gotta be when Andy tells his mom why Chucky threw Aunt Maggie out of their window. And the scene with Detective Norris in the car with Chucky shoving the knife in all different places is just too hysterical for words. I am surprised the actors were able to keep from laughing.<br /><br />Another hysterical part was when Chucky first \\"came alive\\" and attacked Mrs. Barclay. It was so cute watching him hang onto her with his legs kicking. And did anyone else notice that Chucky is somewhat of a drama queen? He loves to scream hysterically, my guess is for attention. And when Chucky says \\"give me the boy and I will let you live\\" I could not help but laugh. Yeah like anyone in their right mind would take that little kook up on his offer.<br /><br />\\"Child's Play\\" not only launched a worldwide cult-following, as well as several sequels (including a new one that is being produced this year) but it also introduced an entirely new genre of movies, doll slashers. Chucky is truly a pioneer in the industry of horror entertainment!

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I have nothing against Oprah Winfrey. I just think she was a poor choice for Narrator for the Discovery version of \\"Life.\\" Her narration is sometimes monotone and boring and other times she sounds like she is reading a story to some 3rd graders. I watched the premier and never bothered to watch any of the other episodes. I will wait for the BBC version with David Attenborough as Narrator. I don't believe BBC has been choosing American Narrators because of a language barrier (that is ridiculous) as some reviewers suggest. I think they are just choosing someone that Americans are familiar with.    With that said, I loved the Sigourney Weaver version of Planet Earth! In fact, I exchanged my BBC David Attenborough version for the Discovery Sigourney Weaver version. Why? I have watched David Attenborough my whole life and hearing his voice made a beautiful production like Planet Earth feel like I was watching a 25 year old nature show, cinematography aside. Even so, I think his narration on Life will be much better than Oprah's.

How did you even get hired to ruin this great program anyways? I guess you have connections. You might as well start another career since you are so popular Oprah.

B000002LVB|5.0|This is a classic.  That's all the really needs to be said.  The album's brillant, and I fail to acknowledge why people beat up on last album's.  Led Zeppelin's last album was critized because according to some people it had too much input from John Paul Jones.  Even though he's one of the greatest bassiests and keyboardists of all time.    This is a great album, if you dislike it, you are missing a lot.  There so much life in this album that it's not even funny.  \\"Sweet Jane\\" will always be my favorite VU song.

It's amazing that someone so important to the discovery behind so many scientific achievements has been hidden by shadows and abbreviations so long. This book was a great read.

B00328G4V6|5.0|Listening to this unbelievable CD, it makes it even more of a shame that we lost Jimi at such a young age.  He was getting better and better with each project.  Sky would have been the limit if he hadn't died so young.  This CD is a masterful collection of songs, with different twists on familiar songs.  I would recomment this CD to anyone who enjoys Jimi's music, or simply like rock music at it's very best.
030745455X|4.0|Looking at all the adoring reviews this book has received, it's interesting to speculate what it is about it that has struck such a chord. It's not the writing as such which is perfectly adequate but hardly sparkling. It must be the heroine, Lisbeth Salandar, the Asperger's Goth girl, social misfit with a perfectly-attuned moral sense, super-computer hacker and lone warrior who can take down a heavyweight champ if and when needed.<br /><br />We root for Lisbeth as she fights faceless bureaucrats, evil corrupt child abusers, fake scientists, Russian mafias and assorted motorbike thugs. She is a kind of super-heroine, decked in the trappings of reality. She can fight all the faceless enemies we struggle so hard against. Lisbeth gives us hope in the triumph of ultimate goodness and the power of the individual.<br /><br />Then, there's the mysterious appeal of the author's tragic life. Why and how did he die so young? Where did he find it in himself to produce these three massive tomes before doing so?<br /><br />Third, the lemming effect. We read this book because everyone else is reading it. We love it because everybody else loves it.<br /><br />Despite my innate suspicion of best-sellers, I did enjoy this book (though less than its predecessor) but it got off to a very slow start. The first hundred pages are just set-up. I guess you can do that if you have an adoring audience. We meet Lisbeth on a Caribbean island, surviving a hurricane with her usual resourcefulness. This part of the story has nothing to do with what's coming and the novel doesn't really get started until she returns to Stockholm.<br /><br />As with the first book, I wondered how people who don't know Stockholm or Sweden get the many references to contemporary and past scandals and all the wealth of geographic detail. (I lived there for 2 years in the 1980s during the height of the Ebbe Carlsson scandal which the books often mention). It seems to me that these books are very Swedish and it helps a lot to know the places, the people and the recent political history of the country. But obviously millions of readers manage to enjoy the books without that knowledge.<br /><br />The main virtue of these novels is the steady ratcheting up of tension the author manufactures leading to the shattering climax. The characters are all well drawn although I missed the counterplay between Blomquist and Lisbeth who don't meet until the very end. The police men and women are especially good. The casual sexism of some of the macho cops was extremely well-drawn.<br /><br />This is a good meaty read.

1573301183|5.0|Performing for the first time after a three year break from the road, Alice in Chains took to the stage in April of 1996 to perform an intimate set for MTV's \\"Unplugged\\" series. As the darkest and moodiest of the big-four grunge bands that defined and dominated the 90's, Alice in Chains were without a doubt at their most natural in an acoustic setting, having recorded two semi-acoustic EP's in [[ASIN:B0012GMUSQ Sap]] and [[ASIN:B0000029F8 Jar of Flies]]. With thirteen of the band's finest tunes in tow, this DVD features the entire performance -- including three songs omitted from the original broadcast -- in all of its Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound glory.<br /><br />Taking to the stage just in time to lay down the first line of the opening number, \\"Nutshell,\\" singer Layne Staley is blatantly struggling with addiction and would rather be somewhere else. In spite of his tendencies to shy away from the crowd and flub a few lyrics (\\"Sludge Factory\\" in particular comes to a halt to allow him to get his act together) Staley turns in a solid and haunting vocal performance, without letting his demons get the best of him.  The band, on the other hand, is as tight as they ever were, with Jerry Cantrell stepping in as frontman more than a few times and Mike Inez taking not one, but two jabs at the band's pals in Metallica, one of which being the somewhat infamous text on his bass guitar, which reads: \\"Friends don't let friends get [[ASIN:B000H6SXMY Friends]] haircuts,\\" a not-so-subtle poke at the band's mid-career crisis.<br /><br />Even though Alice in Chains were themselves experiencing a crisis of sorts at the time, they still manage to put forth a stripped-down set that is alternately haunting and fun. The setlist skips over the entire [[ASIN:B00000272N Facelift]] album, which is a shame, as an acoustic rendition of, say, \\"Man in the Box\\" could have been really interesting to hear. The DVD features are skimpy, consisting of a discography and an incomplete but amusing timeline of the band's history, up to 1999. While the band would ultimately collapse under the weight of addiction and Layne's inevitable death (only to re-emerge in later years) this set is proof of just how powerful and potent its classic line-up (well, post-Mike Starr, anyways) and the iconic songs they created together remains.nd's history, up to 1999.

B003ELNV9Y|5.0|I am relatively new to the Jeff Beck world...Knew the name of course, but saw the Live at Ronnie Scott's video on cable last year, and was just blown away. I always thought of him (wrongly now I know) as a \\"shredder\\". Now I know what the fuss has been about for all of these years - his playing is so emotive, and he covers such a broad range of songs. $7.99 on Amazon is the best $ I've spent for new music in a long long time. This CD is a piece of art, pure and simple. It's a complete CD, front to back, that will stay in my CD Changer/ITunes playlist on heavy rotation for a long time. Very strange to say this, but I almost get the sense that Jeff Beck is \\"peaking\\" again at 65, with some truly amazing music that is much welcomed.

0316044938|1.0|An agonizing read. The author tried too hard to manipulate the emotions of the reader and instead of being drawn in to the story and the tragedy, the book becomes completely unreadable. Overall, the writing is very mediocre, the storyline trite and sentimental, and the characters completely unmemorable. Plus, Oprah book club pick...of course!
B00001U0E1|5.0|There is a lot of stigma that follows this film.  In my circle of cinephile friends, any discussion of the year that was 1998 ends in debate, sometimes aggressive.  Now, I have always felt that Oscar handled the `Director' and `Picture' races correctly (even if my top five differs drastically from theirs).  Steven Spielberg worked wonders with his director of `Saving Private Ryan'.  There is no doubt in my mind that he deserved that Oscar ten times over for what he was able to create.  That said, I find the film itself to be mediocre at best.  The plot is weakly realized, the script is all sorts of bland and the acting is hit and miss.  In fact, the only real saving grace is the sharp direction.<br /><br />`Shakespeare in Love' is leagues better than `Saving Private Ryan', even if the direction isn't as inspired.<br /><br />The film is a fictitious telling of Shakespeare's rise as a playwright.  He is a joke so-to-speak until he finds true inspiration in a rapturous affair with the beautiful Viola De Lesseps.  Sadly, much like the ill-fated romances that circulate the majority of Shakespeare's visions, their love could not be.  Shakespeare was married and Viola was promise in marriage to the evil (not really evil, but highly unlikable) Lord Wessex.  Still, Shakespeare and Viola continued their love affair.  Viola disguised herself as a man in order to participate in Shakespeare's play `Romeo + Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter' (which later became known as `Romeo + Juliet'), all the while keeping her groom-to-be at bay.<br /><br />Shockingly, this film is truly romantic.  For all the slivers of comic glory included, the film has a very beautiful edge that makes it one of the most spellbinding and romantic of all the date-movies of the 90's.  The fact that it remains intelligent and compelling throughout is a major bonus.<br /><br />The film rests on some very sturdy shoulders, and that is a blessing as well.  Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes are believable and engaging here.  A lot of debate can also be found in the Best Actress category, with camps claiming that Paltrow was better than Blanchett and visa-versa.  Personally, I think Emily Watson should have won (actually I think Cameron Diaz should have won, but she wasn't even nominated), but I am one who feels that Paltrow's win was inspired and deserving.  First of all, she did not chew up the scenery in the most dramatized of ways as her competitors did (at least the two I mentioned).  Instead, she allows the slow burn of her charismatic persona to evoke a real sense of emotional relevancy with her character.  She was very, very real.  Joseph Fiennes was also spectacularly real.  I loved the way that his melancholy approach served as a nice contrast to the films comic tones without ever once feeling out of place.  Judy Dench is ravenous as the sharp-tongued Queen Elizabeth, and Ben Affleck shows some comic mastery here as well.  Geoffrey Rush was hammy, but delightfully so.  I don't agree with his nomination, especially when you consider that Tom Wilkinson went without one, but alas, he was good here.<br /><br />Wilkinson was best-in-show for me though.  With such a small role, he never stopped acting.  Wilkinson kind of reminds me of Robert Logia in that he acts from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet, even when attention is not focused on him.  When you watch a scene, Wilkinson could be in the backdrop and not even part of the scene really, but when you watch him you notice that he NEVER drops character.  Here he is sharp witted without ever hamming it up, even for a second.<br /><br />Astonishing performance.<br /><br />In the end, there may not be a lot of weight to this film, but it is beyond entertaining and it really embodies the spirit of Shakespeare well.  I also loved the fact that, instead of painting his life like a mirror image of his work (take that `Becoming Jane'), it showed how his life inspired his work.  Shakespeare had such a wide range inhis work, and I loved how this script skillfully and wittily created something relatable from that work.<br /><br />So yeah, I think that `Shakespeare in Love' deserved that Oscar.wittily created something relatable from that work.      So yeah, I think that `Shakespeare in Love' deserved that Oscar.
B001IXSU8M|3.0|Just got it to see what was so special about it. Not really what i was expecting. But not horrible
0780626966|5.0|Back in the '80's, when I was a little kid, Freddy Krueger was one of the biggest name drops on the playground. Star of the \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" film series, Freddy was a neighborhood child-killer (they never went into much more detail than that on his original crimes) who got off on a technicality and was hunted down and burned alive by the parents of Elm Street. Now, Freddy is after the Elm Street teenagers, this time by slaughtering them in their dreams, still using the homemade, clawed glove he killed with when he was alive. Now, that may not seem like the most interesting plotline in film history these days, after years and years of Freddy/Jason/Michael copycats, and if you have only experienced Freddy in a sequel or two, you might be reminded of something like \\"Leprechaun\\", a horror villain that is as much about comedic puns and wisecracks as bizarre and gratuitous onscreen slaughter. Granted, over the course of Freddy's career, he got goofier and goofier, becoming something of a live-action Looney Tunes character poisoned by pure evil. However, after revisiting these films again recently, I must say, they all manage to be interesting and entertaining, and most importantly, if you haven't seen the original in a long time or at all, you probably don't realize or have forgotten how good it really was. These are still not my favorite horror films and I can't say I ever really found Freddy a very scary character, obviously threatening knife-fingers aside, but I'm glad to have this boxed set as part of my collection, and (talking about the 8 disc release here with the Nightmare encyclopedia) this really is a great package for true Freddy fans or horror lovers in general.<br /><br />Now, in \\"The Nightmare on Elm Street\\" DVD Collection, we get the first 7 films Freddy starred in so far. What we don't get is \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" and the upcoming remake, naturally, which will recast the lead role with Jackie Earle Haley (a fantastic actor you may know as Rorschach from \\"Watchmen\\"). In everything Nightmare up to this point, Freddy was always played by Robert Englund. Robert basically IS Freddy, but I like Jackie, so we'll see how that goes. Anyway, another thing that comes to mind which you won't find in this set is the TV series, \\"Freddy's Nightmares\\", which was a sort of horror anthology show that Freddy simply hosted and ran for 2 seasons. It still has not received a DVD release, and I really don't remember it too well myself, just vaguely. Anyway, what follows is my brief description of the 7 films that come in this set, with my opinions on them. Each film is in its own DVD case (the oldschool cardboard and plastic kind) and carries cast and crew text bios that are from the corresponding film's original release press kit, and the original film and 7th film (New Nightmare) include commentaries by Creator/Writer/Director Wes Craven, stars John Saxon and Heather Langenkamp, and Director of Photography Jacques Haitkin (the newer film's commentary is just Wes). All other bonus features are saved for the 8th disc, the \\"Nightmare Series Encyclopedia\\". An additional note on the package, all the cases are packed inside a very nice, very cool looking outer case. Also included is a booklet of press material for each film and 2 3D glasses to be used during the 6th film's finale if you opt to watch it with the 3D effects.<br /><br />Film 1: \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\": This is the original Wes Craven masterpiece, which, believe it or not, was inspired by real articles Wes once read about some young Thai workers who were dying from a series of extraordinarily bad nightmares. In this classic film from 1984, a group of teenagers who live on Elm Street begin to get picked off one by one in their dreams by the murderous Freddy. Whatever he does to them in their nightmares actually hurts them in real-life, leading to some very disturbing and frightening scenes. Seemingly the strongest of the group, a young girl named Nancy is determined to survive, discover the truth about the killer, and defeat him. Great performances, the original, creepier take on Freddy, and a simpler but more engrossing story are what make this film hold up so well. And many folks will get a kick out of seeing Johnny Depp in his first feature film role as Nancy's boyfriend!<br /><br />Film 2: \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\\" (1985): When a new teen moves into Nancy's old house, Freddy attempts to use him to enter the real world through a possession of sorts. It's a reluctant killer/monster kind of role, and because it is different from the other Freddy films in this way, it's not well liked. Something else often brought up about this particular film is all the gay/bisexual subtext. Overall, this one is not really a story that sticks with you or even that has many \\"moments\\". I'll always remember it as the one I used to run across on television the most when I was a little kid and that scene where the guy is licking his girlfriend's, um... sternum, at a party, but other than that, not very special for the straight audience. Oh yeah, it does have the funny guy from \\"Vamp\\" in it.<br /><br />Film 3: \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\\" (1987): Things got back on track and generally interesting again when Wes Craven returned as writer for Nightmare 3. This one brings back Nancy (and her dad) as she tries to help a new group of Elm Street teens survive Freddy's attacks and use their own special dream powers to defeat him once and for all. The teens are fighting the good fight from a mental hospital to which dream specialist Nancy has been brought on staff. The teen focus of the film this time 'round is a girl named Kristen, played by a cute, young Patricia Arquette, who has the ability to bring others into her dreams with her, allowing them to team up against their attacker. This return to form makes for a great film, gets more imaginative with the nightmares and has some very memorable moments, and yet everything is written well enough to not let it get excessively campy. It's not the first film, but it's a truer sequel.<br /><br />Film 4: \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master\\" (1988): In the fourth entry into the Freddy franchise, the story rightly continues with Kristen from the previous film (though recast here with Tuesday Knight). Freddy returns from... what I guess we'll call death, for lack of a better word, and how he returned is something I'm not quite sure about, unless you just figure it didn't work because he is immortal (which I think was the implied explanation). But, anyway, Freddy's back, he's harassing the survivors of the previous film and trying to get new victims brought to his reach through the powers of Kristen and her boyfriend's sister, Alice. What we eventually discover is that this film is actually about Alice (played by hottie-hot-hottie Lisa Wilcox), who begins to gain power as her friends are killed around her. Each one has a skill that she inherits, allowing her to become a dream warrior and do battle with the immortal Freddy. \\"The Dream Master\\" is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting films in this set. Granted, it helps a lot that I find Alice very attractive, but it's also very creative and a fun story. Some of the acting isn't so great, it's kind of goofy and nonsensical, but it's still highly entertaining. Any flaws it has are much worse in the next film.<br /><br />Film 5: \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child\\" (1989): Freddy and Alice both return in the 5th film, in which a now slightly pregnant (but still totally hot, even if she went from red to blonde) Alice thinks all is well until Freddy tries to come back through her unborn fetus's dreams. Alice, with the help of her friends, must defend her dream child from Freddy while also struggling to discover the mystery of Amanda Krueger, Freddy's mother. With its revelations into Freddy's past, this film does have something to offer, but over all it can be a chore to wthe truth about the killer, and defeat him. Great performances, the original, creepier take on Freddy, and a simpler but more engrossing story are what make this film hold up so well. And many folks will get a kick out of seeing Johnny Depp in his first feature film role as Nancy's boyfriend!    Film 2: \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\\" (1985): When a new teen moves into Nancy's old house, Freddy attempts to use him to enter the real world through a possession of sorts. It's a reluctant killer/monster kind of role, and because it is different from the other Freddy films in this way, it's not well liked. Something else often brought up about this particular film is all the gay/bisexual subtext. Overall, this one is not really a story that sticks with you or even that has many \\"moments\\". I'll always remember it as the one I used to run across on television the most when I was a little kid and that scene where the guy is licking his girlfriend's, um... sternum, at a party, but other than that, not very special for the straight audience. Oh yeah, it does have the funny guy from \\"Vamp\\" in it.    Film 3: \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\\" (1987): Things got back on track and generally interesting again when Wes Craven returned as writer for Nightmare 3. This one brings back Nancy (and her dad) as she tries to help a new group of Elm Street teens survive Freddy's attacks and use their own special dream powers to defeat him once and for all. The teens are fighting the good fight from a mental hospital to which dream specialist Nancy has been brought on staff. The teen focus of the film this time 'round is a girl named Kristen, played by a cute, young Patricia Arquette, who has the ability to bring others into her dreams with her, allowing them to team up against their attacker. This return to form makes for a great film, gets more imaginative with the nightmares and has some very memorable moments, and yet everything is written well enough to not let it get excessively campy. It's not the first film, but it's a truer sequel.     Film 4: \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master\\" (1988): In the fourth entry into the Freddy franchise, the story rightly continues with Kristen from the previous film (though recast here with Tuesday Knight). Freddy returns from... what I guess we'll call death, for lack of a better word, and how he returned is something I'm not quite sure about, unless you just figure it didn't work because he is immortal (which I think was the implied explanation). But, anyway, Freddy's back, he's harassing the survivors of the previous film and trying to get new victims brought to his reach through the powers of Kristen and her boyfriend's sister, Alice.

Alice, with the help of her friends, must defend her dream child from Freddy while also struggling to discover the mystery of Amanda Krueger, Freddy's mother. With its revelations into Freddy's past, this film does have something to offer, but over all it can be a chore to watch (probably much worse if you aren't as intoAlice as I am) due to some of the casting just not pleasing me. For one thing, never could stand that kid who plays the dream child, and I find Alice's new friends on the annoying side too. Some of their lines are on the cheesy side to be sure.    Film 6: \\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\\" (1991): Now, I gotta say, this has to be the most over the top films in the Freddy saga, not contemplating New Nightmare's premise. In \\"Freddy's Dead\\", intended to be the last Freddy film, Freddy does meet his end (even if he does return again in Freddy vs. Jason), and we do get more fascinating glimpses into his past and a look at his offspring, plus the truth about Freddy's special state of existence, but I swear, this is the goofiest movie of them all. The video game kill, the Johnny Depp cameo, the Escape from New York opening, the 3D ending,... oh, and don't get me started on Rosanne and Tom Arnold! By the way, they must have ignored the condition of Springwood here when they wrote \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\"... gotta rewatch that one to be sure though. Anyway, in this film, set in the future (from when it was released, anyway), Freddy has killed all the children and teens of Freddy's stomping ground of Springwood, Ohio, and now wants to reach his offspring in order to gain access to new victims. This takes us to a shelter for wayward youth in which a group of young teens are planning an escape. They unwittingly end up in Springwood with a doctor from the shelter, and of course, the fun begins all over again. In the end, we're treated to a father/child face off that requires 3D glasses for almost no effect. I mean, it doesn't look very 3D on my TV, but that stuff never did seem to work on home sets. Maybe when I get an HDTV it will be better. Anywho, you CAN opt to watch the film entirely in 2D. Overall, this film is bad, but entertaining throughout.     So, before I get to the 7th and final film in this set, let me say that I think the best films are 1, 3, and 4, not necessarily in that order, but probably. 2, 5, and 6 had their good qualities, but were over all not very good. New Nightmare is a completely different animal though.    Film 7: Wes Craven's \\"New Nightmare\\" (1994): In Wes Craven's return to Freddy, he took a very different route; VERY different. \\"New Nightmare\\" is not an actual part of the Freddy continuity. In fact, \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" would be more fitting in this set as the true 7th Freddy film. Honestly, Freddy isn't even in \\"New Nightmare\\". Instead, what we get is a demon that has taken the form of Freddy. Though, I'm sure some would argue that this is the \\"true\\" Freddy, closer to the original intention of Wes Craven, but frankly, that doesn't make him the best Freddy. While Freddy became a bit of a caricature as his series went along, something characters with strong personalities often do, and while he may be more frightening without any humor, he's also boring that way. Yes, sadly, I think I'm going to have to be one of those folks who wasn't all too happy with New Nightmare as a viewing experience. But I'm getting ahead of myself. The film is actually about real people, those who worked on the Freddy films, playing themselves. And, yes, that sometimes means having to watch non-actors act, including Wes. And the focus is again on Heather Langenkamp, the actress who played Nancy, this time playing herself. As it turns out, an ancient demon that is kept prisoner by the art of storytelling has been trapped in Wes's films as Freddy Krueger all these years, but now that Freddy's character is dead, the demon is free again and going after the woman he knows as Nancy. It's a crazy and kind of cool idea, but like I said, the fun is sucked out of it and it's mostly about Heather trying to keep her son safe while everyone believes she's losing it. It's interesting enough the first time around (and I know people who say it is their fave Freddy sequel), but the only things I really enjoyed in this one were Robert Englund playing himself and  one really hot babysitter played by Tracy Middendorf. This is nothing against the filmmakers. I know Wes loves this one, but it seems too much of a personal project. Probably much more enjoyable to the people who actually worked on the Freddy films than to the average horror movie-goer. So, basically, it's a decent scary movie, but it's disappointing for someone out to see a Freddy film, I think. But, what do I know? I actually think I got the most enjoyment out of \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" over all the other Freddy movies. Then again, maybe I lean a little more towards Jason..., which is kind of funny, since my personality is more Freddy-like. Anyway, before I close on this one, I should also mention that this film does remind one of \\"Scream\\" in some ways, and this is something often said about it, except that Scream had much wider appeal. Of course, this film predates Scream, and something I forgot to mention earlier was that the \\"Scream\\" who hasn't seen the original Elm Street in a while (or at all) will probably really enjoy connecting all the things taken from it for the later film.      Now, as for the Nightmare Encyclopedia, I won't spend too much time on it. You get trailers for the films, tons of interviews, music videos, images, alternate endings, and vintage clips. It's pretty much everything you'd hope for in DVD extras. For me, the most fun was the MTV stuff, especially the Dokken video for Dream Warriors (as good as watching any of the films, ha) and the intro for it. You could spend a lot of time exploring this disc, as there is a game-like way of finding the various features, but thankfully, you can also use the index.    So, overall, if you're a Nightmare fan or want to explore the saga for the first time, this set is outstanding. Overall, it's an enjoyable entertainment experience. Freddy is a classic and enduring icon, and watching this set, I like him more than ever before. It's always better to watch a continuing saga back to back, so this is the way to do it. This is a highly fun and imaginative horror series, whether you find any of it actually scary or not. I have never been one to be truly troubled even by my worst nightmares, but some folks take them very seriously.  If your dreams trouble you, this might be the kind of horror film that sends chills up your spine too. I do recommend getting \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" as a companion to this set though, as I enjoy that one probably the most along with the original \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\". And, as for that upcoming remake, I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with it. As usual with the new remakes, it looks like they are trying to really get creepy with it, and I think it'll be quite good, even if I kinda feel that Freddy is like Indiana Jones: a character only one man can truly portray, at least per century, ha. But, like I said, the new guy is a great actor, so I'm giving it a chance. Plus, Katie Cassidy is a goddess, though I'm sick of seeing her get killed in horror movies...
0747589356|5.0|I loved this book for what it is--a book about one womans journey through life, derailed by a failed marriage, who ponders the meaning of life. She has the courage to live abroad, and experience a different lifestyle on her journey to discover who she really is. This book made me scowl, laugh, smile and roll my eyes at her outlook and actions taken involving life. Her book has given me inspiration and hope while making me realize that by looking deep down inside yourself, you can discover who you really are. She helped me realize that God is in your heart, and you do not have to believe in organized religion, or attend church to be spiritual. But according to most Christians, that make me an Atheist!
1563895579|4.0|This book is not strictly a graphic novel, but rather a mostly serious, occasionally whimsical analysis of the artistic medium known as \\"comics\\", done, naturally, as a comic book.  McCloud attempts to define the medium itself (starting from Will Eisner's notion of \\"sequential art\\") and then proceeds to define the language of the form, and examine its various facets.  Contrary to my expectations, McCloud does not make any assumptions or assertions about the actual content of comics, which to some might seem a major drawback, nor does he try to evaluate the quality of any specific style or product.  Clearly, he wants to transcend such notions altogether and define the parameters of what comics could be, rather than what they all-too-often are.<br /><br />McCloud investigates what there is about the medium that draws us to it, without going into such story-centric concepts as plot or characterization.  He really doesn't even try to establish critical standards for this medium so much as just delineate the issues, and point out some of the difficulties inherent in a form that combines both writing and pictures.<br /><br />While this may sound like a dry textbook, it's really much better than that.  I most appreciated those moments (and there were many) where McCloud points out aspects of the medium that I'd always taken for granted (the gutters, for example) making me really think about facets of comics that I never even realized I knew.  Maybe this book isn't as much pure fun as the comics we're used to, and certainly some of the middle chapters seemed to drag, but anytime you get the chance to look at an old friend through fresh eyes, it's got to be worth the effort.  A must-read for anyone serious about comics, and a virtual bible for those interested in working in the field.
0143038419|1.0|I am trying desperately to find something positive to say about this book.  The author reminds me of a former in-law???  No, that's not positive.  It contains enough hot air to float 10,000 hot air balloons?  No, that's inaccurate--it has more capability than that.  It's a valuable spiritual guide?  OMG, NO! It's too pretentious. Don't waste your $$ and time on this book--even if some airheads made a movie from it!  After all, plenty of movies have been ill-conceived ventures.
B000006ILZ|4.0|Crow City Of Angels second coming is a fanedit that is well put together & is closer to director Tim Pope's vision. The handfull of people who saw the pay per view version & the tiny amount that own the workprint saw an entirely different movie.   To anybody who doubts Crow COA as a good sequel second coming will shut you up it has a different opening it uses still shots images & text for the scenes that Miramax & Dimension cut out. Unlike the 1st 3rd & the 4th movies there's a scene where Danny wants his Dad to come with him he tells him you work for the dead not the living but he can't leave Sarah so he's stuck here on Earth forever. The second coming gels better & is probably the closest will get to what Tim Pope wanted. This movie you'll need to watch by yourself it's more of a Eroupean style movie & it stands as a good sequel. You can find it on ioffer for like $10. Brandon Lee will always have an unforgettable performance Vincent Perez gives an emotional performance & Eric Mabius gives a s****y performance. People give this movie hate & just love Crow Salvation all Eric Mabius does is mimic Brandon Lee & Vincent Perez O'Barr as much as I enjoyed the characters he created he likes Salvation over Crow City Of Angels but fact is Crow Salvation was a piece of s**t this was a good sequel even the theatrical version of Crow City Of Angels was better than Salvation & Wicked Prayer. So oh h**l yeah go find this Crow COA second coming it's a better version it's on ioffer stay away from the 3rd & 4th movies. Oh & Miramax/Dimension please let Tim Pope release his extended cut of the Crow City Of Angels. I know I'm wasting my breath.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I admit that I am not the biggest Sandra Bullock \\"movie\\" fan. I say \\"movie\\" fan because as you all know, she has been type cast as a romantic movie actress. Romantic films are not my general preference. Although, when done well, a romantic comedy can be refreshing! Furthermore, I must state that my previous and further stated opinions are soley based on personal movie preferences, and not the quality of Sandra Bullock's work.        The best way to describe this film is that it hits a home run, or in reference to the movie, scores the winning touchdown! Based on true events, it paints images of a teenage boy in need of a helping hand, and a loving family who takes him in as one of their own. Despite her previous roles, the most amusing thing in this film was Sandra Bullock's witty diologue. I realize that she has previously acted in non-romantic movies. However, this film really shows her dynamic ability as an actress. The only thing that I would have changed about this film is to have the character of Miss Sue, played by Kathy Bates, as a more prominent character.       This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It has a solid story. The development really makes you care about the characters. It is very lighthearted. Although there is the ever-expected \\"sob scene\\", the entire movie was a strait shot for the goal line! This movie is very significant in the way that I can't think of one other new movie worth comparison!
B002M3SOXI|4.0|My 7 yr old grandson read this book in 1 1/2 days he really loved it.He kept reading me paragraphs that he thought were funny(which were quite a few).I have ordered books in the past and will continue to purchase from Amazon.com.I have been very pleased with the whole Amzaon.com experience.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Ponyo is another great anime from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. This is a film like all of Miyazaki's works - it makes you feel good and doesn't make you wonder why you took the time to watch it.
0545123267|4.0|The cover of this book was simple and elegant, yet interesting enough to draw me in. Shiver is about a girl named Grace who has a strange obsession with a wolf, and Sam who happens to be a werewolf. The werewolves in this story are human in the summer when it's warm but change to wolves in the winter when it starts to get cold. When the two of them meet, while Sam is human, the romance starts and they struggle to be together as winter approaches. Sadly, as the werewolves get older they are human for a shorter time each year, till one year they just don't change any more. Sam thinks this is his last year.      I loved how the story was told in both Sam and Grace's point of views, even though some chapters were bizarrely short. The transition from one point of view to the next flowed nicely and was never confusing. The two characters were relatable because they have their flaws and the romance was just simply perfect. They were meant to be together, you never doubt it as you read the book.       While the plot was original, it moved at a very slow pace. So even though Maggie's writing was beautiful and cleverly descriptive, I found myself getting bored and waiting for something to happen. It wasn't until the end when the pace picked up. With the last chapter leaving you satisfied but wanting more. For the reader it's perfect ending.       Even though it's not one of my favorite books, I'd still recommend it to anyone who loves a cute romance story. I'll also be waiting patiently for the next book in the series `Linger' which comes out on July 20, 2010.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|I have seen all the principle actors do outstanding work in other movies, but not in this one. Perhaps the weak script, the pathetic excuse for directing and the lack of any resemblance at all to the original Sherlock Holmes made them all lose interest. I know I would have. I think it would take a fairly poor director to get weak performances out of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. But even better acting couldn't have rescued it. The dialogue was lack luster and, as I said, this was nothing like the original Sherlock Holmes. If you don't want to do Sherlock Holmes, do something else. Don't slaughter a classic.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Terrible, terrible.  Couldn't be worse, couldn't be worse.  That being said, considering the length of the movie, it should receive negative stars!  What was John Cusack thinking to appear in a turkey like this?
B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|The art, the charecters, the color are all Miyazaki, the story is kinda Miyazaki, the magic is Disney (which is to say there is none).    I may be wrong but as I understand it, this is a collaborative effort between Miyazaki and Disney.  If so, please, please, please NEVER do it again.  Admittedly I'm an old coot and not the target audience, but I've loved all the other efforts by Studio Gibli and Miyazaki.  Spirited Away is one of my favorite movies.  This is not up to that level.    Go watch something done by Disney while Walt was still at the helm and then watch something from after he left.  Notice the differance?  No Magic in the newer ones.  Thats Ponyo.      I give it 3 stars only because anything Miyazaki does (even with Disney interference) is worth that.
B000OVLBEO|2.0|Visually, I think the director and film crew did the best they possibly could have done with its special effects with a relatively medium-sized budget. Many scenes, however, are too tight, lack space, and lack variety (meaning viewers don't get a variety of viewpoints, angles, and perspectives).<br /><br />As for plot, it was a bit thin. It progresses linearly to the big, blow-up climax, but there are no interesting turns or twists.<br /><br />Character development: It starts out okay as we see Ghost Rider's origin, but the titular character is the only one that is even slightly developed. The villains are extremely underdeveloped, which makes the conflicts quite meaningless. The love interest part of the movie is heavy handed and quite forced.<br /><br />The acting is pretty lame. The guy who plays the Devil did a good job, but the rest were stiff and unrehearsed. I believe Nick Cage has done great in some movies (City of Angels, National Treasure), but not this one.<br /><br />Ghost Rider does have a certain \\"cool\\" factor about it. Here I'm referring to motorcycles, stunts, leather jackets, the open road, an awesome flaming bike, and those sorts of things.<br /><br />My overall impression of this movie is that it lacks depth, acting, and visual atmosphere. The special effects and the \\"cool\\" factor, however, make it watchable and even enjoyable. I give it 2 out of 5 stars based on those two factors alone. It's probably not fair, though, that I do this review after having seen Iron Man, the newer Batman movies, & even Watchmen. Comic Movies have evolved, as well as their budgets.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|The Daft Punk tour in 2007 was a phenomenal show put on involving mash ups of their biggest hits and a fantastically elaborate light show.  Daft Punk seamlessly intertwines several songs at one, applying various techniques to create an entirely new song.  Due to the robotic nature of the music, songs match up perfectly and even play off each other for those listeners who are very familiar with it.  Unlike most live performances, Daft Punk did not try to introduce new music to the audience.  Instead, they stuck with their most popular hits.  It was evident how much the crowded enjoyed this decision.  They go wild when one song is the intro, then proceed to lose it again when another head banger track gets mashed up into the mix.  Their song selection also was extremely bass heavy, creating a mood and environment that I am jealous I could not witness myself.  One after another, Daft Punk melted the faces off of everybody in the crowd, each song more intense and heavy hitting than the last.  Some of the mixed tracks were so good that they could have been singles on their own.  This concert just went to prove that when it comes to techno, nobody can hold a candle to Daft Punk.  Who better to remix Daft Punk than Daft Punk themselves?  Well done, Daft Punk, our minds have been blown once again.   The concert itself had probably the best light show I have ever seen before.  The dynamic duo played from a giant pyramid overlooking the crowd - not a stage.  The pyramid was also covered in colorful LED lights that not only displayed abstract colors, but also images.  Not once was the same pattern of lights used.  Of course, the duo were dressed as robots and never took their helmets off.  Behind them was a honeycomb grid of colorful LED lights.  These lights were synced up to the music as well, but independent from the pyramid.  They too never repeated the same patterns.  Additionally, a giant LED television was behind the honeycomb grid.  This TV was used to display words and creatively worked with the sound samples used.  For example, when samples from \\"Television Rules the Nation\\" were used, the TV displayed static and when samples from \\"Touch It\\" were used, the TV flashed the lyrics of the song.  To make things even better, a DVD was released that was not professionally made.  Instead, it was made up of footage from over 100 different spectators.  This really made you feel like you were at the show and almost never repeated the same angle twice and giving you the chance to see the show from angles that would not be available if the DVD was professionally filmed.

B0035J6TAI|4.0|PG's versions are passionate, mindful, emotional.  If you're a PG fan, you'll like it.  Took me a couple of listens to really get into it.  But once you're on its level, it's a good work.
B002TTYAPQ|4.0|Sort of like the TV show, which I love, but here the detective is is not so much tough as hard and unlikeable, and the writer is not so much charming as boastful and wimpy. When he was finally described as a puppy dog, a couple of times too often, I realized that this wasn't the fun Nathan Fillion TV character but Brendan Fraser's Dudley Do-Right. Laugh at him not with him.  The plot was nice however, tricky and based on useful clues rather than hunches.
115377240X|5.0|Detailed description of Charles Darwin's studies.  Of interest to geneticists and other scientists.  Possibly laborious reading for others.  Paperback book without diagrams referred to in at least in Chapter IV (I have not yet finished reading the book).
0545123267|5.0|I am not the biggest werewolf fan, but the different spin this story had was interesting. I found myself very much in love with Grace and Sam. Their love story was alluring and kept you wanting more. I cannot wait for the sequal to come out!

B0018M6J90|1.0|Miss Pettigrew is one of my favorite books...and this film, alas, except for a superficial similarity in plot, has nothing to do with the book. It was so disappointing. Instead of a charming, light hearted romp full of funny misunderstandings and Miss Pettigrew discovering her fun side, you get a lot of Hollywood slop. You know, the standard formula: Delysia is a girl torn between money and love, Miss Pettigrew is torn between helping her or doing wrong to win her piece of bread...in the end Delysia is whisked off by the man of her dreams who doesn't have a penny, Miss Pettigrew gets engaged to a millionaire and lives happily ever after...The book did have a happy ending, but there was none of this formulaic and moralizing Hollywood tripe in it. Quite the opposite. Oh, and to top it off, the director saw fit to \\"lighten\\" the mood by putting German air raids in the background. Awful. I'm so glad I rented this instead of buying it.<br /><br />On the positive side, if you've never read the book and have no taste for subtle British humor, you might like it. The casting is great, the acting superb and the period sets make for lovely eye candy. What a shame that the director completely changed the story.
0143038419|4.0|My sorority sisters recommended this book to our entire chapter. After reading Eat Pray Love, I can truly say this is probably one of my favorite books.  Elizabeth Gilbert is such a great writer and very humorous. I recommend this to anyone who loves a fun, quick read.
B000002B5L|5.0|The soulful sound of Lauren Hill's vocals is just amazing!  The CD is an excellent mix of talent!  I highly recommend for any diverse collection!
B0030IIZ56|4.0|What'd you expect?  It's Pixar.    Not as good as the original and definitely not one of my favorite Pixar movies, but still a very good movie and enjoyable for someone even in their mid-20s.  If you are a kid or have kids, you'll have a good time.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This is such a charming film.  Full of action, but without the frenetic pace of so many cartoons.  My kids all love it (16-6months -Ok, maybe the baby doesn't love it yet).  Miyazaki films have a wonderful depth to them.  We are firm fans.
B00275EGX8|5.0|Even thought this movie is a biography but after watching. Seem like a movie. Love it.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I for one don't give a flip about \\"Special/EXTENDED Editions\\" of movies. If all that extra footage was THAT important, it would have been in the original cut to begin with. EVERY movie has extra footage, and most of the time it is cut with good reason. I was happy with the theatrical cut and will be buying this release.     I WON'T be getting the special (extended, WHATEVER) edition, I have no desire for it. \\"I'm gonna pay (nearly) twice the price for a few insignificant extra scenes!!\\" There's definitely a fool here, but it isn't me.    Don't turn this into another LotR bluray debacle. Anyone who has bought a blockbuster movie in the last 10 years knows that these things get re-cut. MOST OF US JUST DON'T CARE.    That being said, I have yet to watch a special/recut/extended edition that was significantly better than the original cut. And I have no desire to see a Na'vi sex scene...

193413712X|5.0|While the Booker committee has made a habit of laying eggs of late, the Pulitzer has selected an impressive collection of literary gems. Marilynne Robinson's Gilead, Cormac McCarthy's The Road, Edward Jones' The Known World, Junot Diaz's Oscar Wao and, now, Paul Harding's Tinkers represent what great literature is all about.<br /><br />I was only 20 pages into this book when I felt the overwhelming presence of Marilynne Robinson. Lo and behold, upon reading a Wikipedia entry on the author I found that he studied with Robinson at the Iowa Writers Workshop.  The similarities with Gilead are strong, but not obtrusively so. I would categorize Tinkers as a more experimentally daring Gilead, or perhaps a more transcendental Gilead. The narrative is more disjointed in keeping with the protagonist's hallucinatory final illness, so the experimental nature is not gratuitous. And while Gilead was chock full of good ol' conventional Sunday religion, Tinkers tends to be more mystical and perhaps a bit more melancholy.<br /><br />So who should read this excellent novel? Here you will find no explosions, no cosmic battles, no schools of magic, nobody scurrying about to solve cryptic ciphers. The cast of characters is small but deep; there's no major whodunit here. This is a family saga as told through the final, disjointed memories of a family patriarch in Maine. Like Gilead, the novel consists of the reminiscences of an old man nearing the end of his life. The narrative is not linear; it changes tense, perspective and tone with few signposts for the reader. But if you like a literary challenge, if you like the previous Pulitzer winners and if you enjoy poetic use of the English language along the lines of Marilynne Robinson, you will enjoy this novel.  It's a major achievement.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Akira Kurosawa was well past his prime when he made this wonderful film and it makes the work of most young hotshot Hollywood guys look soulless. The movie \\"Dreams\\" depicts a series of \\"dreams\\", each as I recall it totally separate, non-related to the next and its own little world. And each one I found myself fully immersed in. I could detail each one, but I would recommend you watch it with no preconceptions, no ideas. Go into it with an empty mind is best.<br /><br />Master of \\"digital baroque nerdism\\" the one and only cgi-director George Lucas may have cursed audiences with a few cinematic abominations during the decades following the Star Wars trilogy but he at least appreciated Kurosawa along with his master of the blockbuster buddy Spielberg. So kudos to them for helping with their fortunes bring this project about. Come to think of it, this movie here might very well be the best movie George Lucas has been involved with since the original Star Wars movies.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|This is by far A7x's best cd. The music is much more mature and has a more solid sound. The music is harder but there is a really diverse blend on here. I love hearing The Rev sing on a couple of these songs. The more I listen to this cd the more I love it and now I listen to it constantly. It is always playing in my car and on my computer. I honestly could not get into City of Evil. There were a few good songs on there but the rest were crap. There is not one bad song on Avenged Sevenfold. Even the very strange A Little Piece of Heaven has become one of my favs. I look forward to hearing the next A7X album even though the unbelievably talented Rev will not be a part of it :(
B00005YU1O|4.0|Just enjoy the trip. This is lighthearted albeit at times kinda heady entertainment. The animation was cooler when I first laid eyes on it and before car companies used it in TV commercials but that is the way it goes in our consumer society ain't it.<br />But this flick ain't deserving 1 star. Geeez some people. I hope they simply don't understand 1 star means garbage and is the lowest rating you can give a product on Amazon. Not to get into film reviewing and how one goes about judging films and rating systems and so on. I don't need to anyway. Lots of 1 star chick flicks and mindless fast and furious action/special effects movies for the hormonally challenged video game ADD Generation Y set, OK??! Wake up. Appreciate a little originality at least.<br />There has to be at least a couple scenes you'd dig, being that the \\"story\\" consists of a dude meeting a series of characters played by people mostly playing themselves that say a bunch of stuff, sharing their ideas to him and you the viewer. And some of the rotoscope visuals are genuinely cool. There's a really fun bonus scene that blew me away.
B002AT4K9G|2.0|\\"Fast and Furious\\" is the 2009 sequel to 2001's \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" - though, apparently, the two definite articles in the title aren't the only things that have gone missing in the follow-up to the original.  Absent too is any sense of tension - however slight - that was generated by the fact that undercover L.A. detective Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) wasn't who he appeared to be in the first film's admittedly rather hackneyed storyline.  Here former foes O'Connor and bad boy Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) are working together to bring a heroin dealer - responsible for the death of Vin Diesel's  girlfriend and partner-in-crime (Michelle Rodriguez) - to justice.  Meanwhile O'Connor may be rekindling the romance he had with Torreto's sister (Jordana Brewster), a woman he spooned then spurned in the earlier installment.<br /><br />Of course, one doesn't go to a movie like \\"Fast and Furious\\" for the scintillating dialogue, the astute character development, or the Stanislavskian acting.  One goes for the nonstop car chases (not to mention the scantily-clad bimbos) and, in that respect, at least, this one delivers the goods, at one point turning the greater downtown L.A. area into a giant pinball machine for souped-up, tricked-out roadsters (though Mexico actually gets most of the hot car action here).  But even that becomes fairly mind-numbing after awhile.  And the movie itself is instantly forgettable.
B002UNMWAG|2.0|It's a bit of a heartbreak to write a negative review for this movie because I wanted to like it so much, however, it fell completely flat for me.    It's going to sound like I've got a hate-on here, but, here are the negatives:    1.  Judd Nelson and Peter Fonda playing Italian Mafiosi.  The accents were -uh- not good... and not in the funny way that they were bad in the first film.    2.  Clifton Collins Jr.  Funny guy and very charismatic, but, the part that was written for him wasn't funny to me... it just seemed like one big Mexican joke.  I felt like Troy dropped the ball with this character.    3.  Julie Benz's character.  Gorgeous (love her in Dexter), but, every time she spoke with that southern accent, it completely threw me out of the film.  The character had a lot of potential, but, it felt like Troy was trying to make her an uber-sexy version of Smecker when I think that simply being his protege (with a character all her own) would have been enough.    4.  The Boys.  I love Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus and they certainly did no worse (or no better) of a job in II than in the original, however, it feels like this time they were reduced to buffoons.  I didn't feel any real anger from them this time around at all either.  Sure, the first was funny, but, there was an underlying current of discontent that fueled their murder spree.  I just didn't feel it this time.  I don't necessarily think this was the fault of the actors    Again, I wanted to love this film.  I read other reviews on this site and others and made my purchase.  I wasn't expecting the \\"second coming\\" here, but, I was hoping to have ended up watching, at least, a movie that I was proud to have in my collection and a decent sequel to a great film.    I'm glad I saw the movie (I needed to see it), however, knowing what I know now, I would not have purchased this movie... much less on blu-ray.

B000JML7EC|3.0|I have tried to read Treasure Island numerous times.  A couple times when I was younger and once as an adult.  Every time I found it to be a bit boring and ended up not finishing it.  This time I was determined to make it through it.  I made it, and the book was okay but I think compared to modern day adventures the adventure in this book was pretty tame.  I read this on my Amazon Kindle<br /><br />I think everyone knows the basic story.  A young boy and some companions form a company of sailors and take off to find buried treasure on Treasure Island.  Ends up part of the company are pirates and mutiny upon landing at the Island.  Struggles on Treasure Island commence between the loyal sailors and the pirates.<br /><br />The writing style of this novel has definitely aged with time.  It isn't horrible to get through; it's pretty readable and the beginning of the story really grabbed my interest.  As time goes on though the story gets bogged down with description and predictability.  This isn't a story where characterization or action scenes are a strong point.  It is an excellent adventure in the sense that they end up on a tropical island in the middle of nowhere; the struggles they face though are more related to dealing with the pirates than dealing with any trouble the Island throws at them.<br /><br />Maybe this story is just too well known, but for some reason I found it very predictable and this made getting through the lengthy descriptions even tougher.  This book does do a wonderful job describing pirates and personifying their characters, but it isn't much fun.<br /><br />I think younger readers will find the story tedious and boring, they may also struggle with the stilted language.  Older readers may appreciate the lush descriptions, but will ultimately find the action scenes lacking and the adventure to be not quite as adventurous as in modern day works.<br /><br />Overall an okay novel.  Not as exciting and engaging as I had hoped for.  Now I can say I read it and move on.  I don't know that this is one I will read to my son when he gets older, I think it would bore him.  When compared to other classic novels I have read this year, this was my least favorite.  I found both \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to be more engaging and interesting.this is one I will read to my son when he gets older, I think it would bore him.

B00122KW0I|5.0|Howard Shore's Middle-Earth masterpieces never get old, and these complete recordings are a treasure. The CD/DVD box set is lovely, but a bit much money-wise, so I opted for the MP3 download via the Amazon download store. The music is top-quality, but I did find one very minor problem. Track number 12 is titled wrong, and that was a bit confusing. But I found the correct title and made the change in iTunes, so it was a quick fix.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|Some people have criticized this release as an obvious money grab. My opinion is that this is an expansion of an already great album. Yes the extra five songs could have been included on a reworking of the original disc, but so what. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this set. The book is very interesting and colorful. I also like the fact that it is a good quality hard cover. The DVD is fun to watch( Jimi and Kieth sharing a laugh, Kieth surprising Mick with an early ending to Prodigal Son, Janis shaking her butt to Satisfaction, the audiences hair and outfits, etc.)The inclusion of the B.B. King and Ike and Tina Turner material makes this record of a fantastic show more complete. Any fan of 60's era Stones will love this product. If your concern is the cost, buy it through Amazon and save some dough like I did!
B00337KM2S|4.0|This movie was only about half as good as I thought it would be.  It came very close to being the equivalent for George Clooney of what \\"Jerry Maguire\\" was for Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Largely my disappointment stems from the fact that Alex turned out to be a total whore.

It captures the music and spirit of New Orleans and the character of princess Tiana is as good as any Disney has done before. All of the other characters are memorable and well developed, I especially liked the voodoo villain . A thoroughly enjoyable film that I recommend to everyone!

B0020MR8ZG|5.0|With the arrival of Daniel Craig, Bond has evolved toward a more athletic, more pulse-pounding action hero--more like Jason Bourne.    This is a good thing.    And \\"Quantum\\" takes this trend to the max.  From the opening shot of the car-race through the Sienna tunnel to the boat-race in Haiti to the DC-3 flight in Bolivia to . . ., the action is nonstop, and the plot is deliberately murky.    There's even the self-satire of having the \\"Tosca\\" players shoot blanks while Bond and foes shoot lead.    Constantly moving, constantly shifting, never quite clear, this is wonderful movie--and not just an action movie, a wonderfully puzzling mystery.    Top notch.

B0001KZM3O|4.0|I for one like this album,but I'm a fan of rogers solo work.If your expecting to hear typical Floyd,your going to be   disappointed.Many people like to think that this was part 2 of The Wall; which in a few ways, it was.But for the most  part, was rogers use of many studio musicians and studio toys.Richard wright isn't on the album;after being asked to  leave the band after the wall was finished,and there is very little sounds from David and nick.If you like solo  waters, you'll probably dig this.
B002NOAF9W|2.0|This package could have been so good...and they just got it ALL wrong! First, why not add the 4 extra tracks to the original track listing and add more unreleased music from the vault...Second...as great as Ike and Tina and the others are...this is not about them. This is absolutely one of the best live recordings ever...and it could have been made even better...but I think the really botched this one...BUT...I would like those extra 4 tracks so I guess I'll moan and pay the high price for these tracks and the little bit of extra video...
1579126286|5.0|This book represents Agatha Christie at her absolute best. But then, it's so hard for her not to be at her best...Anyway, I read this book over the summer in a day. I just couldn't put it down. No one can. Besides having a brilliant mind that can create these fascinating plots, Agatha Christie also had that way of writing that keeps the reader hooked. I will not go into the plot because that would be spoiling it, but I will say that this book is set at a high class beach resort in the early twentieth century, and of course, involves a murder (maybe more!). There is nothing more I can say without spoiling the book for you, so, now, after reading my brilliant and insightful review, leave a comment saying it was helpful and order or check this book out of a library immediately!

B003DES8I6|2.0|Julie Benz was sexy and her character was fun; a great addition.  But while I like Clifton Collins Jr., his role just didn't fit well with the story; so a good actor, but a lousy role.    The first Boondock Saints had flaws, but it was classic, and I have watched and enjoyed it many times.  This one I enjoyed watching once, especially Benz, but it just isn't going to be a classic and although I bought the DVD, it will be a long time before I watch it again.     All in all, rent it, don't buy it.
B003F3NDP8|4.0|Make no mistake: this show is basically a glorified soap opera, with much better acting and plots. However, it is pretty funny. The plots get so off the wall sometimes that it becomes hilarious. Each season has a separate story arch that usually involves a murder or somebody's deep, dark secret. Each episode also features a unique story and many plot twists. Things get pretty zany after several seasons. Over the past 5 years, it has included many (many) extramarital affairs, murders, holdups, hurricanes, gang lords, and dead bodies in the freezer.     This season has been pretty good so far. Angie and Danny as the new family on the block are good additions to the show. Angie in particular adds a lot of spunk. Unfortunately, it hasn't really developed the theme or subplot as strongly as some past seasons. It's only now that the backstory to Danny is becoming revealed. Also, the whole plane crash thing was kind of silly. However, a lot of the episodes were funny, especially the whole Russian gold-digger.

Its so simple, so to the point and yet its extraordinary. Not preachy at all, very down to earth, gentle but straight up, no nonsense. Ive read this book over and over and it really brings me peace of mind when I'm being tested by external circumstances in my life. It takes a while before one can actually keep the 4 agreements I think, but its not impossible. Ruiz is very encouarging and I'd recommend this to anyone truly wanting to change the way think about themselves and the world around them.

0307389839|5.0|I bought this book for a nephew that does track and field. I read it and bought a second copy for myself. I had read Murakami´s Kafka on the shore, Chronicles of the windup bird and The Elephant Vanishes. This book works as a complement to the Murakami readings. Even though he doesn´t present his process as a writer still this book helped me, in an oblique way, understand Murakami as a writer.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Most sci-fi movies about first contact with aliens are optimistic about humanity, portraying the event either as a chance for peoples of different nations to make common cause against alien enemies ([[ASIN:B000WQWPKA Independence Day [Blu-ray]]]) or a moment that inspires us to reach for the stars ([[ASIN:B002I9Z8G2 Star Trek VIII: First Contact]]). While fun, most of these movies feel more like fantasy than a probable reality.    [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9]], by contrast, takes a different approach. This movies is about a first contact from hell, in which alien refugees are corralled into slums by cynical humans. This is certainly a very, very different portrayal of first contact. The film's approach to humanity, the mix of opportunism and sheer indifference, strike me as jarringly realistic. I know it sounds crazy, but at times I though to myself: yeah, this does seem possible. This could be how it happens.    Part of [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9]]'s success comes from the way it was filmed. Much of the movie is filmed as if it were a documentary. Television crews accompany the hapless bureaucrat Wilkus (Sharlto Copley) as he evicts the aliens from their shacks, giving it the feel of a news report more than sci-fi/fantasy movie. The movie also interviews \\"experts\\" in alien biology and sociology, which brings audiences up to speed on the situation. At first, I was skeptical about this cinematographical technique because it sounded a bit corny, but it's actually very effective. It really helps blur the distinction between reality and the movie, allowing viewers to become totally absorbed in the story.    I was a bit disappointed that, midway through the film, it seemed to descend a bit more into a typical action flick. It never quite went too far to spoil the movie. In fact, one of the things I really loved about the movie is how the characters responded. Even during the most intense battles, when other movies would have simply focused on the big fireballs, [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9]] has compelling moments when the various characters must make important choices.    I thought everything else in [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9]] was superb, from the acting to the soundtrack. The special effects were great. I loved the design of the aliens. These aren't simply giant blue people (a la  [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar]]). The \\"prawns\\" as they're called are alien enough that they look creepy and make you sympathize a bit with the government's decision to quarantine them. However, they also are able to convey emotions and demonstrate their intelligence and humane side.    [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9]] is easily one of the most original films I've seen this past decade. It's got the spunk, soul, and plot that films like [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar]] simply don't possess. Highly recommended. I hope there's a sequel.    Note: The DVD has some of the best deleted scenes I've ever seen. There is a lot of material not included in the film, including a lecture about the anatomy of the aliens.

0393072231|5.0|There's a reason \\"The Big Short\\" by Michael Lewis zoomed to the top of the NYT non-fiction best-seller list.  It's that good. There are fascinating, disparate characters--Steve Eisman and Michael Burry among others--who figured out early that the subprime market was a train wreck about to happen, profited mightily--but also warned of their convictions. One of the perverse benefits of the U.S. economic meltdown has been a series of excellent books:  \\"Lords of Finance\\" by Liaquat Ahamed, which just won the Pulitzer for history; \\"Too Big to Fail\\" by Andrew Ross Sorkin (a friend dubs it \\"too big to finish\\"); \\"The End of Wall Street\\" by Roger Lowenstein, who wrote one of the best books on Warren Buffett; and \\"The Quants\\" by Scott Patterson, a Wall Street Journal veteran. Michael Lewis taps into the same talents that made his \\"Liar's Poker\\" a winner:  exceptional writing, great anecdotes, fast pace. He treats all the arcana deftly, too. I find all these books addictive.  And, at bottom, terribly sad. Will we learn from them?
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I love this album!!!  I have to say I was really surprised by the Fergie track.  She can rock!!  Her voice works perfectly with this kind of sound.  I never expected a hip hop singer to sound this good doing hard rock.  I was very impressed.    The two tracks with Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge are excellent.  Kennedy has amazing range and sings the hell out of \\"Back from Cali\\" and \\"Starlight\\".  The Chris Cornell (of Soundgarden) track, titled \\"Promise\\" is a fantastic song as well, sung with passion and feeling.  The Iggy Pop track, \\"We're All Gonna Die\\" is just plain, unvarnished fun.      There's really not a bad song on this album.  If you like Slash and his unique, chromatic style, you'll love this album.  I listened to this album again and again over several days and liked it better each time.  It's an excellent album.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is about the Holocaust and a man named Oskar Schindler who became an unlikely hero during to the Jews.  Throughout the movie we see the progression of the war and the changes that occur for Jewish families in Germany and Poland.  Schindler seems to possess psychic abilities as he moves to this area with the intent of capitalizing on the war.  He speaks with a Jewish businessman and accountant names Itzhak Stern, who is also a valued member of the Jewish community, about potential investors in his ideas.  Stern helps Schindler obtain investors and initiate his business.  Schindler purchases a metal factory and with the advice of Stern begins to run the factory using solely Jews for laborers.  Stern helps arrange for important members of the community to get jobs at this factory, as those who are working are safe from being removed from the ghettos at that time.  Eventually a labor camp is established nearby and the factory workers are forced to begin working under the Nazi commander Goth.  Goth is very brutal and the Jews are killed for the slightest thing under his leadership.  Schindler befriends Goth and is able to keep an eye out for Stern who he appears to care for deeply, taking him food from a party one time.  When Goth is notified to close his labor camp and send his workers to Auschwitz.  Schindler convinces Goth to allow him to purchase his workers in order to open his own factory in his hometown.  Goth allows him to make a list of the people that he wants, and Schindler and Stern make a list of all the people they can think of.  Schindler has to rush to Auschwitz and is able to bribe the head SS officer to allow him to take \\"his\\" Jews after a misdirection of the women's train.  We learn the Schindler has no intentions of really producing ammo for the war, but actually only protecting the Jews.  Schindler uses all the money he has made to support the workers and bribe Nazi officials.  Just as Schindler's money is about to run out, the Germany army surrenders.    This film depicts scenes of family worship during the Nazi occupation of Poland.  It shows scenes of the families praying prior to eating.  There is also a scene from the train station that depicts the important belongings the Jews have chosen to bring with them, there are multiple menorahs and other religious items on the shelves along with clothing and jewelry, displaying how important religion was to them.  After the Jews are moved to Schindler's factory, he allows them to observe the Sabbath and practice their religion more openly.  Before he leaves the Jews at the factory, they give him a ring with a quote from the Talmud that states, \\"He who saves the life of one man, saves the world entire.\\"  This was to show their appreciation to him, but it also shows their religion as they incorporate it into their gift.

0375842209|3.0|I think this book may be a bit over-hyped...or maybe the subject matter has been dealt with in better and much more moving ways.  In the end it really didn't impress me all that much.  Zusak has an obvious writing talent, he's very witty and lyrical and except for the constant bold faced headlines in the middle of every other page (what was up with that?) I enjoyed reading him.  The idea of death as a narrator for a book dealing with WWII intrigued me but I don't think he took full advantage of it, he did a much better job of the reading/writing/book stealing.   I was very impressed with his character development, especially the women from Liesel to mama and even Ilsa the mayor's disraught wife, I don't think there is a single character that I felt was underdeveloped or predictable except death.  I read that this was meant as a teen book, and maybe its fine in that venue, I just expected to be bowled over based on the reviews and I was just left with little to take away.

Great gift idea!
B001I0T92Q|5.0|This is a great memory card adapter.    I purchased it to use with my Sony PSP.  I bought a single 8GB Class 6 MicroSD card to use with the adapter.  Formatting and getting the card up and running was a breeze.  One thing worth noting, speed will not be an issue for you with a PSP if you get a class 6 or better MicroSD card.  I've been using normal old Sony Memory Stick Pro Duo cards in my PSP, and this setup I have now is noticeably faster, especially when loading games from the memory stick.     Beware, the adapter itself is a we bit flimsy, but as long as you plan on keeping it in your PSP or other device, you will be A-OK.  All in all I am completely pleased with this purchase.
0307455874|5.0|Into his book just now, I find our President's remarks pure patriotic adrenalin for hope in this world that is going critically and fundamentally, (in the worst sense of these two words) towards a septic mass that promises to digest itself, unless it buys into that \\"hope\\" this man advocates.   Let no one make the comparison of him with Lincoln, lest this President be swayed away from the high purpose that is to be his own struggle, for fear of martyrdom.   Find Robinson Jeffers' poem regarding the America of post WWI, to round out my sentiments. By these, may God Bless America and all in this world that similarly highly regard the experiment declared in the 1776 claim for Independence~now gone radically interdependent in this world's need for all right relatedness.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|If you enjoyed Avatar in cinema, you should avoid at all coast this horrible editions. As usual, James Cameron brings the first DVD and BD edition with the wrong AR of the movie. In case you didn't notice, this awful version of the movie is cropped from 2:35:1 to fit the 16:9 home screen, so, you'll buy a 1.78:1 modified version.    forget this piece of junk, and wait for a proper version. i just hope that they don't took so long as they are doing with Abyss, that's still non-anamorphic.    looks like this 1st version is made for screen lovers only and not for cinema fans. I'm sure that in time, they'll release a decent edition in 2:35:1, as they did with Titanic.    don't waste your money on this extremely flawed edition.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|I don't believe there is any doubt that Fawlty Towers is the funniest show ever! There are only twelve episodes, but how could there be anymore?<br /><br />Fawlty Towers is just so well written and filled with so much comedy it would probably have been impossible for the high standard of these shows to have continued. I was fortunate enough to have met John Cleese and work with him for about a week on a film. I asked him after he mentioned he'd like to do more television whether he'd ever make more Fawlty Towers. Cleese responded that he couldn't because more episodes could never live up to the public's expectations. I believe that he is absolutely correct.<br /><br />The show has various types of comedy, but I believe farce is the main ingredient. Although there is a non-Spaniard playing Manuel the Spanish waiter, who speaks little English and understands less the character is show in a sympathetic light. He is not being made fun  of because he is a foreigner. In fact, the person who comes off the worst in this show is Basil Fawlty himself! Every nationality - almost - is made sport of in the show. Americans, Japanese and Norweigens, Irish, Greeks, French, Germans and most especially the English.<br /><br />Literally there are laughs all around. There is ample helpings of the comedy of embarrassment, the deaf, senile, homosexual, upper class, lower class, the dead, old people, children, and psychiatrists are all made fun of. It is a very inclusive show which is NOT to be taken seriously.<br /><br />We should all be thankful that we have 12 episodes of this great series. The extras on this complete collection are very good as well. The interviews with Cleese and Sachs are especially good.
B002T921DE|5.0|GM's Live in London DVD delivers a Flawless perfomance of George perfoming from Earl's Court in London. Fortunately, I was able to see him in concert, and this DVD delivers just as much energy and excitement right from the comfort of your own home! Spinning the Wheel is by far my favorite performance. Anyone that purchases this DVD will not be disapointed. The second DVD a documentary, enables fans to see George off-stage rehearsing and having a great time with family, friends and tour crew. If you are a fan you will want this DVD as part of your collection.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|The first time I heard this band was I heard them live in Baghdad. Yep, they came to Baghdad and performed thanks to the USO. Huge big ups to the band for doing that. That show was completely free and they gave 110% in that show; completely rocking the hell out of the crowd. I would've gladly forked over money to see that show and felt completely satisfied that I got my money's worth.<br /><br />So, with that being said, after I saw them live, I immediately went back to my chu and downloaded them. The album is just great all around metal and like the concert if I had to pay money to see them, I got my money's worth with the album.<br /><br />Awesome solo guitar riffs and excellent music to just bang your head to. The lead singer has a very full bodied scream and he can actually sing, which is few and far between with most metal bands. It's a very visceral and testosterone filled metal album, which is awesome. Most new metal out there nowadays is a few kids still in high school screaming about problems that only impact teens and I can't relate to that crap.<br /><br />All in all, buy the album. I haven't bought their second album as of yet, but I will soon when I get sick of blasting this one, haha.<br /><br />Btw, great album to lift to, for those of you that like to lift out there.

B00275EGWY|5.0|This movie is great. It's an awesome story and yes; it's Hollywood.<br /><br />So please... don't take the film at face value.<br /><br />Like all war films, there are certain things that Hollywood tends to glamorize. Please, don't ruin the film by dissecting what they got wrong and what they got right. It's not that serious. Just enjoy the film, because you'll miss out on a great story.<br /><br />The cinematography in some of the scenes got me going. It was a great film and I felt that it was told pretty well. I loved the ending, btw. That was a great touch.<br /><br />Crazy, intense scenes; too. There were some scenes that literally I was really into it and was like \\"No!! Don't go in there!! Watch your back!!\\" haha<br /><br /> There are some things that happen in war that the film touched on and of course there are things that it embellished. All in all it seemed to work pretty well. I loved it!<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, rent it or borrow it from someone and see if you dig it. I'm adding it to my collection and I only have a few war movies in it (obviously, Full Metal Jacket is one of those). So only a few select war films are in my collection.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|this is a great movie its very sad but needs to be seen by everyone capitalism injustice is not spiritual
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I love Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock; so putting them in a movie together was a pretty great idea.<br /><br />I was skeptical about this movie, but it surprised me. I'm gonna add this movie to my collection because it's a great date movie that a couple can watch and both enjoy. Usually, I get dragged into watching things that have nothing for me in it (for example, The Notebook... sweet lord; that was horrible). Yet, this movie has enough comedy that it made me laugh out loud at a few parts. I was shocked that Betty White is still alive, actually, haha! But she's really funny in it too, shockingly enough.<br /><br />So all in all, it's worth buying. I wouldn't buy it new. It's one of those movies that I wouldn't spend more then ten dollars for, but all the same, it's worth adding to your collection if you like funny date movies. It's a date movie that even a guy would like and not be ashamed to watch.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|I am a die hard Sade fan - recently purchased this new album and loving it. Everything great from track 1 and 2 which are my absolutely favourite Sade songs of all time. And I agree Soldier of Love is so different from anything the band done before and easily could be considered one of their best songs - if not the best ever. I would recommend this album to any serious music love. It should be listened to in its entirety and not in pieces.

0307266303|5.0|Christopher McDougal's \\"Born to Run\\" is a dual story; a reflection of his experience in preparing for a race between the greatest American ultra marathoners and the Tarahumara, and argument of the uselessness of the running shoe franchise. I enjoyed how the perspective came from an average runner expanding into the world of barefoot ultra running, himself, and not just another self glorifying memoir like Dean Karnaze. The novel was successful as it convinced me to buy the vibram five fingers and I opened the book as a skeptic partly because my mom was the one recommending it. I found the part about anthropology very interesting. Persistence hunting should be a sport. McDougal seems to convert everyone who gives the book a chance all around me I hear of success stories like \\"I no longer have knee problems,\\" and probably also has to do with how he justifies every sentence with many points. He is so persuasive I feel as if I am in a court room. I opened the pages having many running novels under my belt so when he talked about prominent running icons like Bill Bowerman, or Percy Cerutty; I knew exactly where the story was going. However, he explains each character and the non-runner should not fear because this book is a great read for anyone who gives it a chance.  Felix H.

B000007ODY|4.0|This is a good Brahms cycle and would please any Brahms collection.  We can find here the typical Karajan style of conducting of that years.  Precision, clarity and brilliance of sound, but a bit of lack in deepness.  Karajan made earlier recordings of Symphonies 1 and 3 for DECCA with the  Wiener Philharmoniker that are really thrilling and much more preferable.   Would have been desirable to complete a cycle with these forces for that   seal. Whatever, this is a good cycle, but there are for sure better   alternatives (Sanderling, Klemperer or Abbado)

0375842209|5.0|Seriously, I have emailed the President, the First Lady, my senators, my reps, Keith Olbermann, Rachel Maddow.  . . I guess I should also try Glenn Beck and Fox News.<br /><br />How do I find the words to describe the absolutely stunning novel by Markus Zusak in his 2005 \\"The Book Thief?\\"<br /><br />The first attraction is the unusual choice of narrator:  Death. Death  is fitting, since the story takes place in Nazi Germany during World War II. Death is kind, cynical, funny, big-hearted. Death does his job, but he doesn't understand the way humans treat one another and why there is war.<br /><br />The main story is of Liesel Meminger, an orphan brought to Molching, just outside of Munich. Her foster parents seem an unlikely pair: a loud-mouthed, swearing fish wife and a calm, kind painter who plays an accordion. Each has something to teach Liesel about life, as do all her neighbor friends, especially Rudy and the Mayor's wife.<br /><br />When the Hubermann's take the chance to help a Jew by hiding him in their basement, the stakes are raised for the whole family, to keep their humanity in a world gone mad. Max endures only through their kindness and compassion. Liesel finds him fascinating. He writes and draws stories for her on transformed pages of Mein Kampf.<br /><br />Liesel becomes a book thief as she longs to learn to read and write, stealing one book at a time and then using those books and those words to heal others.<br /><br />In a time of rancorous debate and name-calling here in America, Zusak's commentary on the rise of Hitler and the power of words is an important voice. THE POWER OF WORDS. . . may we never, ever forget.<br /><br />If you have not yet had the pleasure of reading The Book Thief, find a copy today. It will change the way you think about life, death, and words. And that's not just a bunch of hot air.

I saw this short film on Netflix through a friend and after seeing it, I just had to own it so I can share what people missed out on.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Other people have gone into great detail about the movie.<br /><br />I will chime in to smite the people putting this movie down:<br /><br />It is NOT a repackaging of 1.00/1.01.  It's a very different movies.  Hundreds of edits were made to further clean this up and expand on the theatrical release.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This link has a side by side showing the differences.<br /><br />This movie is fantastic.  If you like anime you need to own this.  If you do not have a bluray player and HD tv, go out an buy them so you can watch this movie.

B002XKUWVM|2.0|I'm a long standing Foreigner fan despite their low brow reputation.   I purchased the Wal Mart version of this set for a lot less money.  The live DVD is pretty good.   Even though the only member of the original band is founder and key writer Mick Jones they have added people who can really play and sing and it's quite enjoyable.    The Can't Slow Down new material portion isn't worth purchasing because the material just doesn't hold up.  It's well recorded and well played but the songs are VERY unoriginal and nowhere close to as good as even the later Lou Gramm releases.    The thing that made the Wal-Mart set work for me was the remastered version of the Greatest Hits.  It's noticeably crisper and I heard stuff that I had never heard even after countless listenings of the original LP's and many CD reissues and greatest Hits collections.    I haven't heard the live CD from this set but I can't imagine it's better than either of the Live CD's I already have.  (Make a trip to the used CD section and pick up Best of LIVE, it's a compilation of years of live performances culled through by Bud Prager.)
B001GCUO5M|3.0|Contains spoilers.      'Shutter Island' begins with a very interesting start and I went into it \\"clean\\", having avoided all the publicity and reviews. I really had no idea what it was about, or who was even in it (other than Di Caprio). The basic setup is handled very well and is fairly snappy, getting to the point quickly. In short, we're presented with the two feds (previously unaquainted) on a ferry to the asylum to investigate the bizarre disappearance of a female inmate. The presentation is superb and it all feels very \\"noir\\".    However, around the hour mark after the feds have been on the island for a little bit, the film tends to trail off somewhat. That's not to say it gets boring, it doesn't, but I certainly felt my interest going. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that the punchline is rather obvious and anyone watching the film will come to the same conclusion that presents itself at the end. In addition, the investigation is so outlandish and Di Caprio's character seems like a tourtured individual from the outset, that it becomes difficult not to see this train coming from a long way away. Something is obviously wrong in the world of 'Shutter Island' as well as Teddy Daniels and putting 2 and 2 together ain't that hard. Any fan of the 'Twilight Zone', or stories of that ilk will have the \\"twist\\" sussed out in a flash. Which, is extremely unfortunate for the film as a whole.    Apart from that, it's generally handled in a competent manner. But I feel that Scorsese has pulled back from his form of old and is content to go by-the-numbers too often these days. As far as I am concerned he still hasn't made a \\"great\\" film since 'Goodfellas', which is very difficult to top I admit.    On a side note, I find it extremely hard to watch anything with Di Caprio in it. He's one of the most overrated actors working at the moment. He's quite hammy in this at times, or maybe it's the fact that the other actors around him show him up for what he is. Although, in fairness he has the hardest part to play. There's great support from Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow and everone else concerned, but the story itself is the film's greatest letdown...    ...and on the whole it's just not as smart as it thinks it is.
B000001GXB|5.0|A perceptive reviewer points out that some pianists suffer more than others from transfer into digital sound. I agree. Going digital makes brilliant pianists with a forceful touch and precise articulation sound brittle. Pollini, like Horowitz, has his share of recordings that have come up harsh and glassy on CD, and this set of late Beethoven sonatas is one of the most frustrating examples, because it penalizes Pollini for one of his greatest gifts, the ability to produce fortissimos without loss of speed.  The opening of the \\"Hammerklavier\\" is a marvel, as Pollini turns the alternating octaves for the left and right hand into a sweeping unity that flows directly into his overall conception. Where Schnabel seriously falters and others are forced to slow down and segment the phrase, Pollini isn't even slightly daunted. Yet DG's piano sound is so hard that this passage becomes clattery, to the extent that the original digital release was all but unlistenable. The \\"Originals\\" remastering offered a degree  of improvement, but it's time that DG caught up with the enormous progress made in digital manipulation over the past decade and redid this acclaimed set from scratch.<br /><br />Pollini's greatest gift as an interpreter is his ability to make an entire movement move in a single arc from first bar to last. Such focus seems all but superhuman in Beethoven's late sonatas, whose technical demands are extreme. They force all but a handful of pianists to pause for breath, or to play from bar to bar without truly mastering the larger structure. There is also a special intellectual problem with late Beethoven, since his intentions are radical and enigmatic. Pollini is one of the few pianists who can think out and convey a complete interpretation -- once again I'd offer the first movement of the \\"Hammerklavier\\" as a case in point. Schnabel always had something to say but not always the technique to communicate it. Serkin was quite successful, however, and it's to him that I think Pollini should be compared. Brendel and Kempff reduce these works to a smaller, more manageable scale, but for the utmost in intensity, rigor, and technical bravura Pollini and Serkin occupy an all but unmatched status.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I went to the online music sites and listened to the first movement of the \\"Hammerlavier\\" from a dozen prominent pianists. Mostly I confirmed what earlier exposure had told me: Gilels on DG is accomplished, serious, and dull. Kempff in his later cycle recorded in stereo can't really handle the technical demands easily. Andras Schiff turns in a surprisingly spontaneous reading that attacks the challenges head on, although I don't really hear a full interpretation. Surprising was Arrau, whose account is faster than most when I expected it to outdo Gilels in weightiness, but Arrau is too cautious with the tough technical parts and seems a bit aimless, as if he's applying his generic Beethoven voice. Another surprise was Brendel's live version, included in his second complete cycle on Philips, which displays more energy and strength than in early years -- it's also his slowest account, but not drastically so. With these readings in my head, I turned to Serkin's account on Sony, which is magnificently heroic and daring, even if the piano sound is regrettably harsh. And Pollini crowns them all with breathtaking command.<br /><br />(I wanted to make these few comments immediately, but as time permits, I'll review each sonata individually and compare it to Serkin's various versions on Sony andDG.)hink Pollini should be compared.

Low [[ASIN:B00001OH7W Low]] and \\"Heroes\\" [[ASIN:B00001OH7V Heroes]] are just better all the way through. Yes I am an Eno fan so take this review with a grain of salt!

B0039W1J0Q|1.0|I was so looking forward to listening to this cd.  It opens with a tragic version of Bowie's \\"Heroes\\".  The song starts out mellow and you can feel the anticipation as the song starts to build.  Tragically, Pete takes too long to go anywhere and it's all over.  After track 2, I found myself skipping through the songs, searching desperately for something to listen to.  Alas, the entire cd is one tragedy after the next, each song mournful.  I did actually listen to the Talking Heads cover, but it wasn't worth it.  If you are contemplating suicide, don't listen to this cd.  If \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" was on this cd, it would have sounded like a death march, only worse because a \\"march\\" suggests there might be percussion.    This is a classic example of what happens when an artist thinks they need to grow, and people expect more from them.  I am betting the original concept for this album and the final result are worlds apart.  I can't imagine Peter Gabriel ever releasing something so dismal.  Someone should have made him sit down and listen to the entire album two times in a row before signing off.  He would have never made it.    He could have taken a lesson from Devo.  They did a song survey on their website to see which songs people want released.  If Peter had done this, I think the outcome would have been very different.  This is like a bad Bjork cd on acid.    In summation, don't buy this disc.

B000068OCS|3.0|Many reviewers on these pages have written at length about questions of aspect ratio for 'Koyaanisqatsi', and I'm glad to see people finally taking these questions seriously. But why has no-one mentioned the marked problems with the soundtrack of this DVD version? Few films rely on the effect of the music as much as this one, and I would suggest that the experience of viewing this film derives in fairly equal measure from Reggio's visuals and Glass's music.  Why then is the sound quality on this DVD so shoddy? It really is appalling - much worse than the stereo of my old MGM VHS tape version, which takes some doing. To anyone who works professionally with audio (as I do) it's clear what has happened - the audio has been shabbily processed by someone who hasn't even bothered to listen to what they've done. If I may quote from a perceptive reviewer at DVD.net.au: \\"the audio has been time compressed in an effort to pitch-correct the music. Unfortunately, the time compression software (or hardware) that's been used here is sub-standard and not suitable for music. As a result there are clearly audible audio glitches throughout the film, particularly on sustained notes of particular pitches. In the case of this disc, the LFE channel is the worst-affected (thanks to the sustained notes from the organ) but there are problems in the other channels as well. Whether you'll hear them depends on how keen your ears are, but to this reviewer's ears it made the audio almost unlistenable at times. A real disappointment.\\" Now why the music should need pitch-correcting is a whole other question, but the answer is simple. It doesn't.  The fact is you don't need to have particularly keen ears to hear the mess they've made of this marvellous music - you just need to be listening properly. If you are interested in music, audio fidelity or quality DVD authoring, buy this disc with caution. In fact the two-disc set is cheap enough to buy it just to see what it's like, but be prepared for possible (if not probable) disappointment.

B002VECM6S|5.0|I was a little skeptical when \\"The Blindside\\" was released at the theater and the previews didn't really peak my interest.  I watched the Academy Awards and was surprised that Sandra Bullock won the Oscar for best actress... I have always liked Sandra Bullock, but never thought she would be able to pull off an Oscar worthy performance.  How wrong I was.  She was perfect!  The story is a beautiful, heartfelt one and is true which makes it even more interesting.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing/buying.

B002MXA7TC|5.0|I was hammered and it was around 1 AM when I first saw the video for Sweet Disposition. I remember that the song immediately sucked me in, and I was in a trance watching the video and enjoying the harmony and the building momentum of the song, and the chorus did not disappoint.    At the time, I was pretty well under the influence, so I sent myself an e-mail to investigate the song and the band later. The next day, I began my investigative work (sober) and found I was just as moved listening to the song for a second time. I decided to quickly preview a few of the other songs and really liked what I heard, so I purchased the entire album (a less frequent event for me these days).    The band is skilled, the lyrics are thoughtful and the music is pretty clean for a debut album ... almost too clean. These guys are good. They bring an original sound to the table as well (primarily in the vocals but also in the sense that they aren't afraid to mix harmony and falsetto with some upbeat percussion - usually it's one or the other).    I strongly recommend this album to anyone who is on the fence

B001FB4W0M|5.0|These two guys are incredible good in ideas, principles and terrible in manners, but it si the new era of the SciFi: Just for entertainment. In this season, you can find the Winchester with new direction, helped by the angels, and very intelligent form to present them: as guys who have the only think to follow orders from God, in despite of there are only 4 of them who can talk him directly, a very human feeling.<br />And mixed with others chapters, out of this principal story, but gives you a fresh and cool mix.

0446569895|5.0|I AM OZZY is a pick for any fan of rock star Ozzy Osbourne or for general libraries strong in contemporary musician autobiography. It comes from one of the most colorful figures in music history, describes the passion and excesses of his rock n roll lifestyle from drugs to violence, and makes for a fine and revealing survey of the rock star's life and perspective.

B001EN71CW|5.0|If you've never seen this series or only experienced it through [[ASIN:B001KOFH2G Serenity]], you owe it to yourself to at least rent it to check it out.  A truly ground-breaking look at the science fiction genre.  There's action, tension, humor, romance--all done well and true to the characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately Fox, true to form, canceled this show before it got its legs.  It had the potential to become an all-time great TV show, but was killed too early.  People have still never heard of it which is a true shame.<br /><br />An easy 5/5!
0061914177|5.0|I really enjoyed this read because Gary is able to convey his message loud and clear - It's all about PASSION. If you find something you love to do, you can make money doing it, if your passion is truly in what your doing.  It all starts with passion.  You can have great products, marketing, the best people, and the greatest system but if you don't have passion you lack what it takes to get to the next level.    Successful enteprenuers all have one common thread - PASSION.  They had absolute passion in their ideas that swelled over into everything they did.  When we are \\"passion focused\\" everything do has got to be the best we can do - our passion allows for nothing less!  When we eat, breathe, and live that passion - everything we do is done with excellence.    Gary gives some great social media, branding and marketing advice and is the most interactive author on the market to date.  This is a man with passion who answers emails and has live video chat sessions practically every day with his readers, he's real and down to earth. Additionally, he has a great website with content updated daily - true service after the sale!  No candy coating the issues or handing you an answer - he gives you information and asks the key questions to get YOUR wheels turning!    For the Gary Haters: (Yes, unfortunately success often comes with a few knives in the back) If you don't agree with his message or are not clear - his email address is in the book, his website is listed and has contact information listed and he's happy to connect with you so go to him and get the clarity or share your point of view.  This is the adult thing to do vs. bashing him with bogus Amazon reviews of his book - many of you never even read it & are dancing to someone elses drum.  Man up people, find your own beat and CRUSH IT!!!
B00006RY6W|5.0|I think there is nothing else to say, I agree with most other 5-star reviews here. Always liked CCR songs, but never really listened to them until now, such a great music, you can fell the soul in it, and thanks to SACD the sound is beautiful, clean and all dynamic. You can fell the drums like if you where there if you got a capable stereo system, play Poorboy Shuffle at high volume, what a great experience. The reverberation on Fogerty's voice on \\"Don't Look Now\\" takes you back in time, when real musicians with real instruments and real voices filled homes and streets with great music and rhythms. I can only imagine, I was never there... I'm 23.<br /><br />For those who experienced those times, it would be great if some of you could post your experiences and anecdotes.
B000TDIE6A|4.0|Air, a French band that specializes in electropop, splashes into their album Talkie Walkie with a smooth romantic piece, \\"Venus.\\" Each song in Talkie Walkie share similar characteristics--each song has a glossed finish to it and a transcendent, cloud-like element that is relaxing. Air's two band members Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel work to create a cool atmosphere of comfort that is just different enough to be interesting.     Air's digital clouds are prominent in all the songs, from the pseudo-Asian \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\" to the electronically charged \\"Biological\\". \\"Surfing on a Rocket\\" and \\"Mike Mills\\" have cruising melodies that are faster and more discrete than the other songs, most of which contain blended tonal hazes. Though these two pieces use a slightly different technique, the repeated riffs serve to create a similar effect as the overarching tones--they are a background to the modulation in \\"Mike Mills\\" and the light, simple vocals in \\"Surfing on a Rocket.\\" These vocals are high and whispery and contribute to the melding of sound.     \\"Biological\\" uses a synthesizer that contributes to the whirling sound in the beginning of the song. Like the Monkees, the first pop group to use a Moog in one of their songs, Air's electronic tones fit seamlessly into the overall mood of the song. \\"Biological\\" and earlier track \\"Run\\" have a tangibly electric feel to them. Parts of \\"Run\\" are stylishly dissonant, creating texture in the piece; using this sometimes-slight dissonance adds variety to the often-repeated word, \\"run,\\" along with the band's manipulation of dynamics. Other songs, however, seem surprisingly analog, considering the band's penchant for using a Vocoder, the Moog, and other synthesizers.     \\"Another Day\\" has an echoy, Europop feel to it that also repeats the same phrase (\\"it's just another day\\"). This repetition is a popular technique on this album--at least with \\"Run\\" and \\"Surfing on a Rocket\\"; both of these songs repeat their title phrase overand over. \\"Another Day\\" is the shortest track on Talkie Walkie, an album that keeps most of its songs within the five-minute mark (with the exception of \\"Universal Traveler,\\" a song that stretches past 7 minutes). Though sometimes characterized in the psychedelic genre, Talkie Walkie keeps its songs from wandering or experiencing slow evolutions, like in The Orb's \\"Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld,\\" an album that contained some very lengthy songs.     Talkie Walkie is a soft-sounding, smooth album with soaring, transcendent songs. It is enjoyable for both the mainstream and those with obscure electronic tastes. While not always exciting, this album maintains its mellow veneer and is almost always pleasing to the ear. Each song on Talkie Walkie has complex layers that add simply together to form an agreeable result, and, overall, it was a refreshing, relaxing album.
0812550706|4.0|I am an avid sci-fi reader, and have to say, up front, that this book was one of the best sci-fi books I have read. I admit that there were some troubles, but the book was a very entertaining read. This book commented on some major issues of ethics and logic, if you slightly read between the lines. For example, you have the whole idea of sending 6 year old kids up into space to train to be commanders of armies.  The question here is one of ethics and logic. The ethics part is whether or not it is ethical to separate them from their families at such a young age, and the logical parties about why this is done. Is it because the kids actually spike in military brilliance at that age, or do they spike at that age because of the training?     Orson Scott Card, the author, wrote this book to give a prequel to his as unfinished idea for Speaker for the Dead. Before he made it into a novel, it was a novella, a piece of work that is shorter than a novel, but longer than a short story. The original novella just focused on Ender, and it started in the middle of the novel. His primary goal in writing this novel was to set up Speaker for the Dead, and succeeded in that task, as the two books flow nicely. However, that leaves some things unfinished at the end of the book, so it is unsatisfying to some readers.     This book succeeded admirably in presenting an engrossing read, but still has a few flaws. At times, the book goes on about topics that seem nonsensical until much later in the story, and certain lines of thought that should have been explored more were forgotten, while others are discussed even after they've dried up. Still these issues were rare and minor, and don't really detract from the book as a whole.     I noticed in the reviews that many one-star reviews insult the people who liked this book, or the book itself, and have to wonder why. These comments add nothing to your information as to whether or not to buy the book. However, some points are made, but the biggest one that I see is that it is not an action book. There is a large volume of complaints about that, but it is not a real issue. There are other sci-fi+action books out there, and so those people should read one of those instead.     All in all, it is a great book that I would recommend to almost anyone.
0307271862|4.0|A thriller from Mankell, one of the best mystery writers out there, and I don't mean just in Sweden (his original home), but anywhere.  While others love his Kurt Wallander mysteries, I have not read them, although I did enjoy the TV series with Ken Brannagh that aired on PBS.      I like the stand-alone Mankell books, and this one begins on a grisly note and carries the reader with its protagonist, the judge Birgitta Roslin, on a journey across continents and into the past.  She's devoted to her judging duties, but delights in the company of her grown children, even as she wonders what the future holds for her somewhat unsettled marriage.      As the book opens, 19 people have been slaughtered in a remote village; in fact, they comprise practically the whole village, it's that small and remote. The killer(s) is especially vicious, having slashed and stabbed almost everyone so that death would be painful and prolonged. Even the family pets are dead on the floor. The investigating team, led by another strong middle-aged woman, is stunned and baffled by the horrific crimes - no one in the two surviving households noticed a single odd noise in the snowy night and early morning  when the killings took place.       Birgitta hears of the massacre, and is immediately drawn in - she is related to some of the elderly people now lifeless. On leave from her duties because of her high blood pressure, she drives north and begins to unearth clues that are for the most part ignored by those in charge. Grudgingly allowed into one of the crime scene homes because she's a relative, she unearths a diary of an ancestor she immediately dislikes, one who brutally abused the Chinese workers in his employ as a builder of American railroads in the 19th century.  Oddly enough, the diary's story ties together the Swedish murders with an American murder committed in the same week, and leads Birgitta on a search for a mysterious 'man from Beijing' whose image was caught on tape at a local hotel. What was this out-of-place Chinese man doing in that remote village, unless he was the killer?      Meanwhile, in China, a very powerful man who is reveling in the success of his ordered rampage, makes plans to establish China as a nation-builder in Africa. This puts him at odds with his sister, a more communistic and idealistic thinker about China's place in the world. Birgitta Roslin's 'detective' travels will take her to China, ostensibly on vacation with a friend, but leading her inevitably into danger when those involved notice her rookie enquiries about the man from Beijing.       The storyline bogs down about three-quarters of the way through, as a trip to Africa and much discussion of China's current involvement there takes place. And yes, the motive for the murders in Sweden begin to seem almost trivial. But Mankell finishes strongly and brings us back to Birgitta for a satisfying resolution
0061703257|4.0|The first Lehane book I read was MYSTIC RIVER, which I absolutely loved. Then I tried two of his Kenzie/Gennaro mysteries and was less than thrilled. Perhaps it was the genre, but they seemed to have been written by a different author. SHUTTER ISLAND falls somewhere in between.<br /><br />SHUTTER ISLAND is set in 1954, and two US marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, are called to Shutter Island to find the criminally insane Rachel Solando who has escaped from a locked room with a guard outside the door and several other guards not far away. Unless she was invisible, there is no seeming way she could have escaped. Daniels and Aule smell a rat almost immediately. Lehane takes his time developing Daniels' character. His wife was killed in a fire set by an arsonist, whom Daniels believes is on the island. There also seems to be another conflict going on between the doctors; some believe in treating patients pharmacologically and others accept surgery, frontal lobotomy in other words. This will play a role in the plot later on.<br /><br />Daniels has nightmares about his wife; he thinks he should have been able to save her. Then a hurricane buffets the island and the two marshals get caught out in the open. Chuck Aule is kind of a Hawkeye Pierce character, always joking and making fun of their plight, but there's something fishy about him. He has almost feminine hands.<br /><br />Lehane drops enough hints so that you should be able to predict what's really going on about half way through the book. Some won't like the ending because it's not a happy one. I have to give Lehane credit. He didn't give in to pedestrian expectations, and that's why this work is a step above the Kenzie/Gennaro series.

6303168507|5.0|Schindler's List begins with a slightly frenzied scene showing the Jewish people being registered. It then moves through several scenes introducing Schindler and showing his level of influence. The movie flows through the first three years quickly until the year 1941, when the Jewish people are forced into the Ghetto. At this point, Schindler is seemingly becoming successful in finding Jewish investors to help him acquire a company in return for household items to trade on the black market. It is revealed that Schindler and his \\"assistant\\" are saving Jewish people by not only forging papers saying that the people are \\"essential\\" to the community because they are metal workers, but also by teaching the things that they need to know to do their said trade, among other things. Schindler acquires and opens his company, and hires the Jewish people that they have trained. In 1943 the ghetto is raided by the Nazis. The people there are rounded up and sent to the concentration camps, if they are not shot on site. Everyone there is killed. People are killing themselves to avoid being rounded up. Families are torn apart. I could not control my tears at this point. Schindler watches all of this from a hilltop.   At one point he begins bringing people in to his factory from the concentration camps; his factory as seen as a safe haven. To me, it gets somewhat confusing as this point, various scenes from the concentration camps, and the lives of Schindler and the Commandant. The prisoners smeared their cheeks and lips with blood to appear healthy enough to avoid selection. I cannot bring myself to describe some of the horrible things that happened. Schindler compiles a list of those people that he can take to his factory- he purchases them all. The women's train is sent to Auschwitz by mistake, but Schindler is able to get them back. He not only saves their lives, he treats them with respect and dignity. Oscar Schindler did amazing and risky things to help whoever he could, however he could. It is good to know that, even in the midst of such atrocities, there are people who still try to do good things. Even at its happiest, and I use the term loosely, it is a heartbreaking movie, made more so by the knowledge that it is true.   So, how does this relate to Judaism as a religion? This movie shows of a period when the complete eradication of the Jewish people was supposedly needed for religious purification. One group of, I'll use the term misguided, souls began the terrorizing, torture, and murder of over six million Jewish men, women, and, most vilely, children. While the movie illustrates the most horrific event to take place by mankind, it is only the last on the long list of mass murder and exile that the Jewish people have undergone throughout history. Over and over the Jewish people have been discriminated on simply because of their faith. And yet, through all of these horrors, so many have the strength to retain the religion for which they were prosecuted. I can only hope and pray with every fiber of my being that nothing like the holocaust ever happens again.

B000JRYOPG|3.0|Shottas (2002) is a movie that unfolds in the American and Jamaican  underworld involving a kingpin with armed associates, clique,  entourage and million dollar lifestyle. This is intended for a  middle-of-the-road, general audience with mass appeal, featuring  gang animosities.    Some will be taken aback from the frequency of Jamaican slang, such  as \\"bloodclot\\", or a reference to Day-O (Banana Boat song) or the  shot caller (shotta.) There's also the matter of the  pronunciation  by the locals, incomprehensible, suggesting a style derived from  mass illiteracy.    Surprisingly, the release is not 16 x 9, which is unfortunate, as  many angles, the editing, the flow of the script and of the story  if often glossy, well chosen, filmed  and delightful.    There is nothing lost in the soundtrack, from an eclectic,  balanced, diversified and eager for risk series of numbers.    The story is food for thought, ranging from the characters -  all  miscreants and juvenile delinquents that are trigger happy - such  that the special F/X dept uses up dozens of blood packs over the  course of 90 mins, to weighing the likelihood that a kingpin can  make  $7 mil merely from shakedowns of other gangs and legit  businesses.    At not time is there any retaliation law enforcement. There is no  tension, either, among the gangsters, about the legitimacy of their  conduct, operations, rivalry, showing an euphoria from beginning to  end, ranging from scenes at clubs to outdoor festivities and indoor  scenes. A non-stop impunity for all conduct is the case, public and  private, in terms of rubouts, gunplay, car jackings,  and  shootouts.    Viewers are made to see a number of \\"toys\\" used by the  protagonists, ranging from a power yacht, a Lamborghini, Mercedes  Benz, Cadillac Escalade, Porsche, Rolex, etc.    The director's boldness is clear, in exposing the underlying  violence affecting much of Jamaica, and in expatriate communities  who know of no other livelihood than crime, firing pistols and  shotguns.  The ugliness and senseless killing, is in plain sight  and the darkness is juxtaposed tightly with hedonistic moments.    The ghetto, as shown, comprises people who are one-dimensional,  emotionally shallow, closed to cultural sources that normally,  permeate people's lives, ( TV, sports, religion, politics, book  authors.) The charactes seem to never have heard of those things,  or been influenced by any of them. The exception is when a  politician, (mingling with gangs perhaps to gain an upper hand on  rivals), turns against his underworld henchmen when they go rogue  and become front page news.    At the end, many will wonder how is it the characters are still  walking the streets, and not in an asylum.    The oversimplification of crime may also be a turn off, not least  of which because some of the biggest and most profitable  masterminds never show themselves, or commit violence personally,  Finally, Ky-Mani Marley's acting is promising, as Biggs.
B000002MIY|3.0|This thing went platinum and features songs,vocals and keyboards by Don Fagen and was produced in classic Steely Dan style by his partner Walter Becker. If you have a full collection of Steely Dan and want more in the style, this concept album is great.

0393072231|4.0|Very entertaining book and I agree with Michael Lewis's recommendations for fixing Wall Street but I was disappointed to find factual errors.  Particularly factual errors that are so easy to look up.  I expect more diligence from such a highly regarded author.  It reminds me of those buyers of CDOs who relied on the rating agencies without doing any of their own due diligence.    1) Michael Lewis describes Michael Burry's investment in Avant! in 2001.  He states that Avant! had a market capitalization of $250 million and then says Burry bought his first shares in June 2001 at $12.  The company had 37,431,000 shares outstanding as of March 31,2001 so the market cap was approximately $450 million based on his initial purchase.    2) Lewis says that Cornwall Capital bought 8,000 2.5 year call options on Capital One with a strike price of $40 for $26,000 in 2003.  At the time the stock sold for $30.  He says that after the stock price shot up the options were worth $526,000.  This is impossible.  The highest price after they purchased their options was $85.44 on August 22, 2005  (45.44 x  8000 = $363,520).  By that time there was very little time value left.  I am assuming they held their options the whole time as they skyrocketed in value and then sold all of them at the absolute highest price - not very realistic!

B00005M989|5.0|i love prince and his music. he is such a unique and talented person. he's one of a kind. i like the fact that he plays his own instruments, writes, and produces his own songs. he mixes funk, soul, and rock all together and make it work and make it into his own kind of style. that's why i love the 80s..there was more originality during that type. people were barely copying each other. not many people i know around me can appreciate his music. i asked them if they did like him or his music..i get \\"hell no\\" or \\"not my cup of tea\\". it takes one open minded, intellect to fully appreciate and understand his music. i think this cd would be a great start of people who are just casual fans or new fans. it has a great collection of my favorites!<br /><br />1. \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\" (single edit) (5/5) - this song marks pre-prince. it was released in the late 70s.<br /><br />2. \\"1999\\" (single edit) (5/5)- i love this song! it's one of my all time favorite prince songs. 1999 is actually my favorite year so this song just happens to be so convenient during the time being.<br /><br />3. \\"Little Red Corvette\\" (5/5) - another hit from him during the 80s. i read somewhere that it has some sexual tones. all this time, i could have never guess it.<br /><br />4. \\"When Doves Cry\\" (single edit) (5/5)-i love the video. one of the most artistic things ever done at its time. he's not known as \\"the artist\\" for nothing!<br /><br />5. \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" (5/5)- it's a great party song with a rock touch to it. it makes me want to get up and dance and the intro is very epic and pure genius.<br /><br />6. \\"Purple Rain\\" (5/5) - one of his best ballads ever! i love the movie purple rain. his only best film. it has such a symbolic meaning to it.<br /><br />7.  \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" (5/5)-my absolute fave. it has some religious references in there as he reassures his lover that he can do no wrong.<br /><br />8. \\"Raspberry Beret\\" (5/5)- so sweet and delicious!<br /><br />9. \\"Kiss\\" (single edit) (5/5)-listening to this song always put a smile to my face. it's hilarious and so was the video where he dances with this mystery woman.<br /><br />10. \\"Sign \\"'\\" the Times\\" (5/5)-i heard this song the first time while watching a movie in class.<br /><br />11. \\"U Got the Look\\" (5/5)-the duet with sheena easton is awesome. i love hearing all the crazy sounds in the end. another reason to love the 80s!<br /><br />12. \\"Alphabet St.\\" (5/5)-very funky and fun<br /><br />13. \\"Thieves in the Temple\\" (5/5)-love it<br /><br />14. \\"Gett Off\\" (1/5)-umm...i don't really like this song, sorry. it's only song on here i dislike.<br /><br />15. \\"Cream\\" (5/5)-i like the way he sings in this song. it sounds so seductive just like the lyrics itself.<br /><br />16. \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\" (5/5) - i love this song!!!!!! it's very beautiful! the songs you hear out now can never have that artistic soul like this!<br /><br />17. \\"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\\" (5/5)-it's very laidback and phil collins-ywas the video where he dances with this mystery woman.    10. \\"Sign \\"\\" the Times\\" (5/5)-i heard this song the first time while watching a movie in class.    11. \\"U Got the Look\\" (5/5)-the duet with sheena easton is awesome. i love hearing all the crazy sounds in the end. another reason to love the 80s!    12. \\"Alphabet St.\\" (5/5)-very funky and fun    13. \\"Thieves in the Temple\\" (5/5)-love it    14. \\"Gett Off\\" (1/5)-umm...i don't really like this song, sorry. it's only song on here i dislike.    15. \\"Cream\\" (5/5)-i like the way he sings in this song. it sounds so seductive just like the lyrics itself.    16. \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\" (5/5) - i love this song!!!!!! it's very beautiful! the songs you hear out now can never have that artistic soul like this!    17. \\"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\\" (5/5)-it's very laidback and phil collins-y
B002GZQYMA|5.0|Recent last year I began to know about Muse music.  I have to say, this is a real rock band, something hard to find in these last years. The resistance is a great record, with a wide range of emotions, a must hear album.  I had the opportunity to watch them in Tampa and they are great, better in live.  Waiting for more music of Muse

B00005JL96|4.0|\\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is second-rate Disney (or more precisely, first-and-a half-rate), but that still makes it better than animated offerings from just about anyone else. It's a real charmer, and if you haven't seen it, by all means do so. (It's a /lot/ better than \\"The Princess and the Frog\\", an extremely derivative film.)<br /><br />For whatever reason, two or more studios will have identical or near-identical ideas for films around the same time -- eg, \\"Antz\\" and \\"A Bug's Life\\". Whether this is coincidence or theft isn't clear, but \\"The Iron Giant\\" and \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" are thematically identical.<br /><br />I'm kidding, right? Crazy, perhaps? Crazy, maybe, but I'm not kidding.<br /><br />Both Stitch and the nameless robot are war machines. Though artificial creations, they are seemingly sentient (conscious and self-aware). Both have the ability to make choices, even choices inconsistent with their intended purpose (death and destruction). Both are eventually obliged to confront the question of what sorts of choices they will make. Both make the \\"correct\\" choice, of course.<br /><br />Of the two, I prefer \\"Lilo & Stitch\\". The idea of a robot -- especially one that's a killing machine -- being able to override its own programming and not only refuse to kill, but behave altruistically -- doesn't make any sense. \\"The Iron Giant\\" is also rather heavy-handed in presenting its point of view, whereas you'll likely miss it in \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" if you're not paying attention.

B0027BOL4G|4.0|This is the first time I'm reviewing a product - ever. I had resisted watching this documentary for a long time as I thought it would be biased, in-your-face and gruesome. In fact, it was well organized, balanced and insightful. After watching this, I realize that I can make some small adjustments in my own life. Not only to be socially responsible, but also, for my own health.     I will not get into how sad or heartbreaking it is to see the animals suffer. Hopefully, we can all agree that at some level, suffering solely for the sake of greater profits in just not humane.     However, on a practical or even selfish level, it is not in anyone's interest to see our food source be controlled by a handful of corporations. If profit is the main goal, and power is concentrated in the hands of so few (corporate big heads who don't see or live with the consequences of their decisions), then you end up with policies like cleaning your food products with ammonia or ecoli in your ground meat. The fact that a family of 4 can more easily fill up at their local fast food joint (under $12) rather than buy vegetables at their local supermarket or that local farmers are so dependent (and indebted) on their corporate customers indicate there are deep rooted issues with long-lasting consequences.    However, as the film makes clear, consumers do have a voice by choosing to buy certain items (i.e. organic, locally produced, free range chickens, grass fed cows etc.) because this translates into profit and profit talks. I would recommend this film to everyone.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis is for my money the best financial writer we have. There are others more knowledgeable than he, but few so insightful and none half so entertaining. While he's been writing on other topics lately,  the draconian nature of the recent financial crisis made it inevitable that he would return to the literary root he laid down two decades ago with Liar's Poker, his expose of Wall Street culture as it appeared to him during his stint there in the 1980's.<br /><br />Lewis's focus is always on the contemporary American zeitgeist, and his usual method is recounting the stories of quirky geniuses whose behavior somehow embodies it. In this latest book, we learn all about Michael Burry, a socially dysfunctional man who has had a glass eye since early childhood and has been diagnosed with variety of psychological disorders, including bipolarism and a mild form of autism known as Asperger's syndrome. Burry is also extremely bright, and has always had an obsessive ability to focus brilliantly on subjects that caught his attention. Medical science was such a subject at one stage of his life, and he got himself into a top medical school, graduated and became a doctor. In between 16-hour shifts at Stanford Hospital, he developed a hobbyist's interest in the stock market, picking stocks and disseminating recommendations for free over the Internet. He soon had a following. His record became so remarkable that professional money managers began taking note, eventually subcontracting some of their institutional money for him to control. Inadvertently, Dr. Burry had become a fund manager.<br /><br />He soon turned his attention from stocks to the much larger market for fixed income securities, and particularly to the booming market in mortgage derivatives, where he instinctively sensed something was wrong. The literally pathological power he had to focus gave him an ability to do something that few Wall Street professionals could: actually read the mind-numbing offering documents that in theory described these complex securities to their buyers. It wasn't long before Burry's initial instinct had evolved into a mathematically-derived virtual certainty that the subprime sector of the mortgage market was poised to collapse. Through the frightening chain of interdependencies he could discern, he knew that this relatively small business was pre-programmed potentially to take down much of the global financial economy with it.<br />Lewis also introduces us to Steven Eisman. Unlike Michael Burry, Eisman was a trained financial analyst, but like Burry he too was a rude iconoclast who cared nothing about social or professional niceties when he knew he was right about something. Born into an orthodox Jewish family but himself agnostic, Eisman was infuriated by the many internal inconsistencies in the Talmud, and he once undertook a detailed study of the sacred text for the sole purpose of cataloguing them. When his financial talent began bringing him wealth, he helped endow an organization that aided Hasidic Jews trying to escape their religion. In Lewis's characterization, Eisman thus lacked the ability even to give away his money without picking a fight. Eisman was later to pick the fight of his life when he would go toe-to-toe with the financial establishment of his day. He too, like Michael Burry, had figured out that the financial market upon which so many careers and fortunes were riding was a house of cards.<br /><br />Lewis tells the stories of several other people as well, all of them coming from different starting points but all arriving at the same inevitable conclusion that a monumental market crash was in the works. What they lacked initially was any obvious way to profit from this foreknowledge, but that was now to change. While credit default swaps had been around for some time, contracts had never been available on mortgage securities, because there was no demand for swap protection in a market so universally deemed safe and secure. Wall Street banks are ever-alert to opportunities, and with a handful of doubters beginning to emerge, the banks were now ready to intermediate between them and other more conventional players happy to earn an apparently safe income stream selling protection against a seemingly impossible event. Thus the very same institutions who had invented mortgage derivatives were now selling the tools needed to bet against them.  From the banks' perspective, it was all the same, since the jobs they believed they were paid to do was simply intermediating between different perceptions of financial risk.<br /><br />From the perspectives of Burry, Eisman and a small group of like-minded players, however, the means was now available cheaply to concentrate small pools of capital on contrarian bets promising outsized returns. For them, it was like being able to enjoy long-shot odds at a race track betting on a horse that couldn't lose. This was \\"The Big Short\\" Mr. Lewis refers to in the apocalyptic title of his book. When the anticipated scenario indeed materialized in 2008, these people collectively earned hundreds of millions of dollars for themselves and their investors. The gain occurred virtually overnight.<br /><br />This is not Lewis's best book. His distaste for the spectacle he describes is too palpable this time for his playful style to unlimber itself as delightfully as it has elsewhere. The Big Short is still easily worth five stars, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an accessible sketch of the deadfall that ensnared our financial economy two years ago. The book belies the claims of bank executives and public officials who still insist that no one could have seen it coming. Here we learn about a few who did and have the newfound wealth to prove it.r-alert to opportunities, and with a handful of doubters beginning to emerge, the banks were now ready to intermediate between them and other more conventional players happy to earn an apparently safe income stream selling protection against a seemingly impossible event.

I not only saw this concert on PBS, I went to see it LIVE when they were here in Boston.  Trust me, seeing in on TV (even HDTV) does NOT prepare you to see it live!! I also have the companion DVD. I can't recommend it highly enough!!! If you love celtic music as I have come to you can't miss by getting this CD!!!

B001IYCMNA|1.0|I purchased two of these Cisco WAP's on the recommendation of an IT professional.  Previously, I had a D-Link router running behind a Verizon FiOS modem with built in wireless.  Having two networks was confusing so I wanted to replace the second router with a WAP to simplify the network.  The Cisco unit connected easily and seemed to work fine but I immediately noticed it was significantly slower.  I tested the unit using both SpeedTest.net and Verizon's internal speed test and the throughput was 1.7mbps or less, usually less.  Prevously, I received 17-19mbps using the D-Link router.  I contacted Cisco and they told me my router was set up improperly and there was nothing wrong with the WAP but could not give me any specifics about what might be wrong.  I switched over to the built in wireless network on the FiOS modem and instantly received 17mbps throughput.  I tried disabling the FiOS wireless and moving the Cisco to another room but still had terrible performance on the Cisco.  After much pressure from me, Cisco finally admited that it was possible the unit was defective so I ordered another one and had the exact same issue.  Thankfully, Amazon has been terrific and accepted both back as returns.  I have purchased another WAP and am receiving 17-19 mbps throughput again with no setting changes so there was clearly something wrong with either the Cisco units themselves or Cisco's customer support which could not help me solve the problem.  I would not recommend this unit if you have a similar setup.
B001GM28HO|3.0|She can sing! She really can sing!  As for the material... definitely high energy stuff. I found the lyrics on most too sexually blatant and demeaning to both men and women. Maybe it's her youth, but she seems to regard men as mere playthings, objects to use and disgard, and that's a shame. A second thought is that she is only mirroring the sad state of our society - hedonism as the prescription for hopelessness. Far off into the future this album will be disected in colleges and considered representative of the times we are now living in.  On the plus side, most of the songs get you moving, and I love her energy. Best cuts: &#34;Paparazzi&#34; and &#34;Poker Face.&#34; &#34;Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say,&#34;) is kind of bubble gum, but at the same time has a tenderness that is refreshing. The rest of it is all a matter of your personal taste. I like a lot of it and play it often. It's light and silly and has a good beat. It's background stuff for casual moments when you want to put your brain on pause.  There are hints here that she has emotional and intellectual substance. I hope that as Lady Gaga continues to mature as both an artist and a person, she will dig deep inside herself and find the treasure within. Once she does that, her subsequent material will wow us. You'll see.

B00004SA88|5.0|The following is my review of the six violin concertos, as recorded by Mr.Accardo under the direction of Charles Dutoit with the London Philharmonic.  The soloist, Salvatore Accardo, has at least 150 recordings, according to the Amazon.com web site.<br /><br />CONCERTO No. 1. The opening theme of ALLEGRO sounds somewhat like the Lone Ranger theme in Rossini's WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE. While Paganini admired Rossini, and had actually performed the WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE (performance of July 17, 1833 in Theater Royal Drury Lane, according to Stratton's book), it should be noted that Paganini composed his Violin Concerto No.1 in 1818, and Rossini composed his overture much later, in 1829. At one minute, 30 seconds, the orchestra provides a \\"dreamy tune.\\" Then, the faux Lone Ranger theme is repeated. The violin solo makes its entrance at 3 min, 10 sec. The solo provides the \\"dreamy tune\\". At 6 min, 35 sec, the violin plays a rapid cat & mouse chasing sequence. In this sequence, the violin uses an interesting jagged technique for descending, from the high register down to the low register. At 11 min, 40 sec, comes a jig motif, where the violin plays 2 notes simultaneously. The \\"dreamy tune\\" returns at 14 minutes. At 19 minutes, the violin solo provides an interesting wiggly-squiggly motif, and the solo continues until the very end, providing skittering motifs and glissandos. ADAGIO is slow and exudes a feeling of pathos and drama. The violin plays in the lower register. At 2 min, 30 sec, the full orchestra provides a brief crescendo, reminiscent of an approaching hurricane. RONDO provides, for the first minute, the violin bow bouncing on the strings, while the orchestra generally provides a regular scheme of chugging chords, each chord separated by a tiny interval of silence. At 4 minutes, the violin solo provides a pizzicato motif, sounding like firecrackers. On occasion, a horn provides a 2-note motif that goes, \\"Ta-taa.\\" RONDO lacks any tunes that might be apparent or discerned by a layperson. (This is in striking contrast to the RONDO in Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 2.)<br /><br />CONCERTO No. 2. ALLEGRO begins with a \\"perky tune\\" played by the woodwinds. At one minute, the strings take over and play the \\"perky tune.\\" The violin solo makes its entrance at 2 min, 50 sec. At 3 min, 50 sec, the bow bounces on the strings. At 4 min, 40 sec, the violin solo provides the \\"perky tune\\" again. At 5 min, 50 sec, the violin solo provides an eerie motif, where two dissonant notes are simultaneously played. Fluttery woodwinds provide a colorful interlude at 7 min, 30 sec. At 9 min, the violin solo provides a sequence sounding like chopping wood (one can almost see the wood chips flying). The \\"perky theme\\" returns at 10 min, adn the chopping wood episode returns, and the 2-note dissonant motif is repeated. ADAGIO starts with a cluster of mellow horns. Later, we hear a gentle whispy violin solo. Accompaniment takes the form of an orchestral string pizzicato. The tune of the violin solo is a bit like Borodin's \\"neverending melody\\" of Polovtsian Dances - Dance of the Maidens. RONDO is the reason I bought this compilation of the six Paganini violin concertos. RONDO, also known as \\"La Campanella,\\" contains a tune made famous by Franz Liszt in his SIX GRAND ETUDES AFTER PAGANINI. I have the recording by Andre Watts on the SERAPHIM label. Anyway, RONDO features a little bell (an actual bell). At 3 minutes, 50 seconds, we hear an interesting descending motif. (I like descending motifs in music.) At 4 min, 15 sec, the famous La Campanella tune returns, and stays with us for one minute. La Campanella returns one last time at 8 minutes.<br /><br />CONCERTO No. 3. ALLEGRO begins with an orchestral pizzicato motif. A jaunty oboe begins a happy tune at 40 seconds into the piece. At 2 minutes, 5 seconds, the jaunty oboe returns with its cocky little tune. At 3 min, 30 sec, comes a dramatic descending episode featuring the full orchestra. At 4 min, 20 sec, weare treated to a lively violin solo punctuated by orchestral pizzicato thumps. The ALLEGRO movement is distinguished by its multitude of special effects from Mr.Accardo's violin: (1) The bow bouncing up and down on a string while bowing; (2) A note changing to another note, by way of a glissando; (3) Violin playing in the extreme upper register, so high that only a dog can hear; (4) Pizzicato episodes; and (5) An almost indescribable special effect that I call a \\"jiggley-slinky.\\" ADAGIO. This movement also begins with an orchestral pizzicato. The violin plays mainly in the lower register. An orchstral pizzicato goes, \\"Tra-dah-dah-dah.\\" There is no real tune or melody in this movement. POLACCA. This movement starts out sounding like music for a contra dance. From time to time, there is a brief pizzicato motif that sounds like crackling fireworks. In the entire CONCERTO No. 3, there is no real melody or tune that a layperson could distinguish or hum. However, I very much like the ALLEGRO movement because of the continual array of imaginative posturings by the violin.<br /><br />CONCERTO No. 4. ALLEGRO begins with a distinctive tune, embellished with a peppering of horn toots, and pizzicato string plucks. The solo violin makes its entrance at 3 minutes and 20 seconds. But for the next few minutes, there is no discernable tune to speak of. At 7 min, 20 sec, there is a clever build-up and climax. At 8 min, 10 sec, there is an attractive descending motif (I like descending motifs). This intriguing descending motif is repeated two minutes later, and yet again at 11 min, 40 sec. At 11 min, 10 sec, there is an attractive jiggley-wiggly motif. At 13 min, 40 sec, there is a pizzicato display, followed by an eerie display of ultra-high notes, a swooping glissando, squiggly-jiggly motifs, and another glissando. ADAGIO begins like a Mahlerian funeral march. The orchestra provides a pizzicato background. At 4 minutes, the sound level picks up, involving horns and drums. All along, the orchestral pizzicato continues. At 5 min, 40 sec, we are again subjected to the brief storm of horns and drums. In RONDO, the solo violin provides a little romping tune, reminiscent of Gilbert & Sullivan's THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOM IN THE SPRING, TRA-LA, HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE KING. At 3 minutes, there is an extended part where the violin plays two notes at once, in the manner of a violin duet. On three occasions, we are treated to an intriguing descending motif (I like descending motifs). The motif of FLOWERS THAT BLOOM IN THE SPRING regurns, and stays with us for a few mintues. From 8 minutes on, comes an intriguing violin episode, sounding like space aliens in flying saucers, where the space alien attack is interrupted at various points by a domestic-sounding 3-note horn toot motif. The space alien motif seems especially suited for the soundtrack of the classic film, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.<br /><br />CONCERTO No. 5. ALLEGRO starts with drum rolls and a bombastic operatic melody, provided by the orchestra. Little solos are provided by the flute, then oboe. At 3 min, 35 sec, the bombastic operatic tune returns. At 4 min, 45 sec, the violin solo makes its entrance (with that dang-blasted bombastic tune). At 8 min, 55 sec, the violin-provides a unique jiggley-effect. At 9 min, 10 sec, the orchestra provides a much nicer tune. This tune is one that whisks and whirls. At 14 minutes comes a gentle tune similar to that of LET IT BE ME, by the Everly Brothers. At 16 minutes, the whisking and whirling tune returns. But the final seconds of ALLEGRO conclude with a repeat of that irritating bombastic theme. ANDANTE sounds a bit ahead of its time. It sounds like it might have been written in the early 20th century. There is more variety here, and no reliance on musical cliches from Mozart's time. In ANDANTE, the violin provides mainly extended notes (there are no high-velocity lightning-speed riffs to be seen or heard). ANDANTE does not really contain any distinctive tune. Now, are you ready for a description of FINALE? FINALE provides a distinctive dance tune, first from the solo violin, then the same tune from the woodwinds. FINALE is in 3/4 time. At 1 min, 50 sec, we are provided with a little marching band piece, lasting some ten seconds. At 4 min, 20 sec, comes an unusual melange of violin swirls hovering over an orchestral maelstrom. This unusual episode sounds like something from a Carl Stalling cartoon piece. At 7 min, 20 sec, comes a flute episode embellished by strange gurgling sounds from the solo violin.  The sound level of the violin in the extended gurgling episode is subdued, compared to the sound level of the orchestra.  At 8 min, 20 sec, the flute episode with the gurgling violin is repeated. And again, at 9 min, the flute episode with the gurgling violin repeats once more. The distinctive dance tune returns at the ten minute mark.<br /><br />CONCERTO No. 6. Overall, RISOLUTO is mellow, and the violin doesn't show off too much. At 5 minutes, 45 seconds, the violin engages in a vigorous half-minute jig, which is repeated at 6 min, 45 sec. At 7 1/2 minutes, the orchestra takes over, and Mr.Accardo gets a well-deserved break. At 13 min, 15 sec, the orchestra takes over, providing a galloping motif. At 14 minutes, there is a quiet interlude, and at 14 min, 15 sec, the violin solo returns. This movement has no discernable tune or melody. ADAGIO. The ADAGIO movement begins slowly, sounding Mozartian. The violin often plays in the lower register. At 6 minutes, the full orchestra provides an ominous-sounding wake-up call. RONDO. This movement is a masterpiece of thematic development. The entire piece has this motif: \\"DA-DAA, 1-2-3-4-5-6, POW-di-di-di-DEE-DEE-DEE.\\" This particular motif is an engaging one, and the listener will delight in the dozens of fascinating variations of this motif. RONDO is an addictive movement.<br /><br />CONCLUSION. More information on Paganini can be found in a book, NICOLO PAGANINI by Stephan Stratton (1907). The book is available from Amazon.com. It is also provided by Google. From this book, we learn that in the first violin concerto, the solo violin is tuned a semi-note higher and the part is in D, while the orchestra is in E flat (page 164). The book also provides a quote from Berlioz, \\"He [Paganini] has known how to render distinct and dominating the tones of a solo violin by tuning its four strings a semitone above those of the orchestra, which enabled him to play in the brilliant keys of D and A.\\" (page 138). The author, Mr.Stratton, believes that it is improbable that Paganini or Berlioz were aware that Mozart had used the same technique in Mozart's CONCERTANTE FOR VIOLIN AND VIOLA, where the viola part is in D, but where the orchestra is in E flat(page 138).ontinues. At 5 min, 40 sec, we are again subjected to the brief storm of horns and drums.

The space alien motif seems especially suited for the soundtrack of the classic film, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.     CONCERTO No. 5. ALLEGRO starts with drum rolls and a bombastic operatic melody, provided by the orchestra. Little solos are provided by the flute, then oboe. At 3 min, 35 sec, the bombastic operatic tune returns. At 4 min, 45 sec, the violin solo makes its entrance (with that dang-blasted bombastic tune). At 8 min, 55 sec, the violin-provides a unique jiggley-effect. At 9 min, 10 sec, the orchestra provides a much nicer tune. This tune is one that whisks and whirls. At 14 minutes comes a gentle tune similar to that of LET IT BE ME, by the Everly Brothers. At 16 minutes, the whisking and whirling tune returns. But the final seconds of ALLEGRO conclude with a repeat of that irritating bombastic theme. ANDANTE sounds a bit ahead of its time. It sounds like it might have been written in the early 20th century. There is more variety here, and no reliance on musical cliches from Mozart's time. In ANDANTE, the violin provides mainly extended notes (there are no high-velocity lightning-speed riffs to be seen or heard). ANDANTE does not really contain any distinctive tune. Now, are you ready for a description of FINALE? FINALE provides a distinctive dance tune, first from the solo violin, then the same tune from the woodwinds. FINALE is in 3/4 time. At 1 min, 50 sec, we are provided with a little marching band piece, lasting some ten seconds. At 4 min, 20 sec, comes an unusual melange of violin swirls hovering over an orchestral maelstrom. This unusual episode sounds like something from a Carl Stalling cartoon piece. At 7 min, 20 sec, comes a flute episode embellished by strange gurgling sounds from the solo violin.  The sound level of the violin in the extended gurgling episode is subdued, compared to the sound level of the orchestra.  At 8 min, 20 sec, the flute episode with the gurgling violin is repeated. And again, at 9 min, the flute episode with the gurgling violin repeats once more. The distinctive dance tune returns at the ten minute mark.     CONCERTO No. 6. Overall, RISOLUTO is mellow, and the violin doesn't show off too much. At 5 minutes, 45 seconds, the violin engages in a vigorous half-minute jig, which is repeated at 6 min, 45 sec. At 7 1/2 minutes, the orchestra takes over, and Mr.Accardo gets a well-deserved break. At 13 min, 15 sec, the orchestra takes over, providing a galloping motif. At 14 minutes, there is a quiet interlude, and at 14 min, 15 sec, the violin solo returns. This movement has no discernable tune or melody. ADAGIO. The ADAGIO movement begins slowly, sounding Mozartian. The violin often plays in the lower register. At 6 minutes, the full orchestra provides an ominous-sounding wake-up call. RONDO. This movement is a masterpiece of thematic development. The entire piece has this motif: \\"DA-DAA, 1-2-3-4-5-6, POW-di-di-di-DEE-DEE-DEE.\\" This particular motif is an engaging one, and the listener will delight in the dozens of fascinating variations of this motif. RONDO is an addictive movement.     CONCLUSION. More information on Paganini can be found in a book, NICOLO PAGANINI by Stephan Stratton (1907). The book is availablefrom Amazon.com. It is also provided by Google. From this book, we learn that in the first violin concerto, the solo violin is tuned a semi-note higher and the part is in D, while the orchestra is in E flat (page 164). The book also provides a quote from Berlioz, \\"He [Paganini] has known how to render distinct and dominating the tones of a solo violin by tuning its four strings a semitone above those of the orchestra, which enabled him to play in the brilliant keys of D and A.\\" (page 138). The author, Mr.Stratton, believes that it is improbable that Paganini or Berlioz were aware that Mozart had used the same technique in Mozart's CONCERTANTE FOR VIOLIN AND VIOLA, where the viola part is in D, but where the orchestra is in E flat(page 138).
1591840562|1.0|This is what the author states as the top most reason to start an organization:    \\" To make meaning - to create a product or service  that makes the world a better place. So your first task is to decide how you can make meaning.  Meaning is not about money, power, or prestige. It's not even about creating a fun place to work. Among the meanings of \\"meaning\\" are to:    * Make the world a better place.   * Increase the quality of life.   * Right a terrible wrong.   * Prevent the end of something good\\"    The self-examples he quotes to highlight the \\"meanings\\" are:    - \\"In 1983, when I started in the Macintosh Division of Apple Computer, beating IBM was our reason for existence. We wanted to send IBM back to the typewriter business holding its Selectric typewriter balls\\"    - \\"In 1987, our reason for existence became beating Windows and Microsoft. We wanted to crush Microsoft and force Bill Gates to get a job flipping fish at the Pike Place Market\\"    This is unbelievable! Beating IBM and Microsoft are \\"meanings\\" that make the world a better place? Or, reasons that improve the quality of life? Geezzzzz... Give me a break! These are the most ridiculous examples I have come across and this demonstrates the immatureness of the author. I stopped reading the book immediately after these paragraphs!    Instead, how about rolling out services that help alleviate hunger, huh? Or how about developing low-cost medical diagnostic test kits? Or, many such more no-brainer examples!    I wish there was a minus (-) 5 star rating, which is what I'd liked to have given this book!    The reason the book has got 5 stars from so many of the readers is probably, at the best, the book has a feel-good factor.
0091857023|1.0|This made a lot of sense to me when I read it one of the last months in my pregnancy - it seemed like a balanced approach. But once my twins were born, none of the advice seemed good. The worst part was that \\"The Baby Whisperer\\" recommends putting your baby on a schedule of breastfeeding every three hours on the third day after the birth, at which time the milk hasn't even come in yet. As I found out later, all authorities recommend free access to the breast at least the first two weeks. Fortunately, I didn't kill my milk supply with this stupid advice, but my twins clearly suffered, cried a lot and didn't put on weight. Once I had the sense to start listening to my children rather than some self proclaimed expert, they needed to be fed approximately every two hours in the very beginning as children with birth weight in the lower ranges of normal can do.
B002NV9AH8|5.0|Tony Banks based the concept of the theme, according to him, on the short story Flowers For Algernon, but changed it due to a conflict with the stage version of Flowers occurring around the same time. However, the themes expressed in this album seem much more personal than a mere adaptation of a book. In fact, they form a missing link to Banks's consistent lyrical works with Genesis, and actually illuminate or explain those other works.<br /><br />Although Banks calls it a concept album, it is actually closer to the way Duke was done, which is not considered by most to be a \\"true\\" concept album because there is no single unifying story linking all the songs. (To me, however, a concept album has an all-encompassing theme that is throughout all the songs, but not necessarily overtly plot-oriented. I think people confuse \\"concept album\\" with \\"rock opera\\". Opera has, by definition, all the songs linked by a single story, like its theatrical decendant musical comedy. If you have an album with a concept, it's a concept album.) This looseness of \\"plot\\" in each song is apparent in the title track, \\"Somebody Else's Dream\\", \\"In The Dark\\", and even in the instrumental \\"Forever Morning\\". In these songs he's speaking directly from himself.<br /><br />The comparisons to Duke seem particularly apt for \\"Somebody Else's Dream\\". (Some of the same lyrical themes are echoed in the song \\"Duchess\\".) If you look at the overall Genesis timeline, this album was released in October 1979, and Duke was recorded the same year (but released in 1980). No doubt this album influenced Duke, which is certainly the best Genesis album of the Collins era, if not the band's entire history. \\"Somebody Else's Dream\\" also has a relative in \\"Many Too Many\\" (from And Then There Were Three). And, yes, \\"From The Undertow\\" is from an older version of \\"Undertow\\" (also from And Then There Were Three).<br /><br />Although there are many comparisons and parallels to his Genesis works, knowing Genesis is not necessaryto understanding or appreciating A Curious Feeling. It certainly stands on its own, both lyrically and musically. Besides Duke, however, the other Genesis album it might have a lot in common with is Wind and Wuthering, which happens to be Banks's favorite Genesis album (see the Wind and Wuthering reissue interviews).<br /><br />Some of the musical criticisms seem to center around the vocals. Any vocalist that may have been used for this album would be to most people just Not Phil Collins. Hearing (the late) Kim Beacon singing on this album that is very Genesis-like takes getting used to, but he will grow on the listener in repeated listenings. Chester Thompson was also a natural choice to play drums on this album. Banks does fine on guitar, but decent bass guitar parts are lacking. He admitted bass guitar was a problem, but perhaps he should have stuck with bass pedals (a synthesizer controlled by a pedalboard), as this also gives the synth parts a grand, pipe organ-like sound. We also get to hear full piano layered over full synths, which is not something that occurs often on Genesis albums. Normally he has one hand on one instrument and the other on another, or even an occasional vocoder-triggered synth (cleverly used in the title track of Abacab to give a guitar-like sound). The album has a mostly timeless feel, with the exception of the title track (\\"The Aga Khan, the ex-shah of Iran, or the Man From U.N.C.L.E.\\"?) which is trying a bit too hard to be a hit single.<br /><br />It's really shocking that this album never had the impact of Collins's Face Value. So spread the word about this new remastered version of A Curious Feeling. It certainly deserves a second chance.
0521677432|5.0|I bought this book used and besides I paid cheaper than a new one, the book came in excellent condition. It is like a new one. Even the CD ROOM. This is a second time that I bought an used bokk from Amazon and all of them are always in great conditions. Regarding to the book issue, I recommend this book because it has a great content in English vocabulary with many exercises, even in the CD. As I am a writer, I found in it great descriptions about people appearance, what it helped a lot to write my book chapter.
0307454541|4.0|From the very first page this book grabs hold of the interest and creates anticipation making you keen to find out what happens next.  The story is well written and very explanatory.  It gains the interest and makes you eager to find out what is going to happen next.  Certainly the writing style is equal to a Clancy or Le Carre, yet without their tendency to embellish and over describe situations and events,and that is very acceptable and refreshing.  An excellent read that leaves you  wanting more.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|This should be called \\"A very loose translation of a story associated with the book Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\\"    I really enjoyed the Harry Potter books, and the audio books(with Jim Dale Narrating) even more. This movie, as well as the previous ones, are simply an attempt by some screenwriter to get his name up in shining lights. The story is quite different from the books. I realize that much has to be cut from the books in order to make it into a reasonable length movie, but there are many parts in the movie that were changed, as if for no other reason but that the screenwriter could get away with it.  For instance:     The beginning of this movie has Harry in a local shop, (not in the book) and has cut out any reference to #4 Privit Dr. This opening could have been done much better in the time allotted. Quite frankly the beginning of the book is the funniest part in the the whole book.     The train ride to Hogwarts is changed considerably, with no real apparent reason to do so. This whole section has been reduced to garbage.       The book has Tonks finding Harry on the train, but the movie has Luna Lovegood doing it. Since Tonks is not cut entirely from the movie, this really doesn't make any sense.      The Burrow is burned to the ground in the movie, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the book. Stupid.     All of the battle at Hogwarts has been cut.     The part in the tower bothers me the most I would say. The book has Harry immobilized through this whole part, unable to do or say anything. The movie however, has Harry just standing there, while Snape and Draco do their thing. Absolutely stupid. It really goes against what Harry's character is all about.     It seems that none of the students are now required to wear robes. They are all running around in either suits, or jeans and a tee shirt.    None of these changes needed to be made, really. It wouldn't make one bit of difference as far as time or money. It is a dreadful shredding of what is one of the better books in the series, and the changes really just serve to deaden the story line, and set up another two dreadful movies to come. I will not be paying to see those in the theater for sure.     Foolish screenwriters. What a waste. The movies keep getting worse and worse.    The acting has gotten, if anything, worse in Radcliff's case. He always has a stupid grin on his face, as if he finds the whole thing very funny. As he is supposed to be in some very dire circumstances in this movie, it really just ruins the effect completely.     I did like Rupert Grint's handling of Ron's character. I thought he nailed it.    What bothers me the most, is that all the young fans that made Rowling rich, are expecting a decent representation of the the books put into film. They are all so excited to see these films. Instead what they get is a great disappointment.
B002ZE85YW|5.0|This is a great addition to the Terminator series. Great story line which sets it post Judgement Day in Western California(Los Angeles, San Francisco, places in between) But was actually all filmed in Arizona which helped with the barren desert landscape design. You also really get a good look at the many designs of machines in this film which James Cameron didn't have the time to get into detail in Judgement Day. T-1s, T-600s, T-700s, T-800s, Hunter Killers, Moto-Terminators, The Harvester, you name it...this movie has it. Now actorwise, Christian Bale(The Dark Knight) as John Conner is for sure a lot better than the guy who played John in Rise of the Machines, very bad ass with a REAL desire to kill the machines and save his father, Kyle Reese played by Anton Yelchin(Star Trek). Then...finally...Sam Worthington(Avatar) as Marcus Wright...oh my god...I tell you, if Sam Worthington didn't play this role I don't know who would have. In 2003 Marcus Wright is on death row for killing 2 cops and his brother, he donates his body to Cyberdyne after his execution for experiments. He is then awakened in 2018 as a one of a kind infiltration prototype terminator which befriends an A-10 pilot, Blair Williams played by Moon Bloodgood(Street Fighter) and a love story forms after Marcus saves her multiple times. You will find out that Marcus Wright is the key to get John Connor into Skynet to save his father from being terminated. This talented aussie actor really did a break out role in this film and is my personal favorite character. This film has non stop action, amazing actors, and great effects to make this personally one of the best Terminator films yet.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|For anyone who's a fan of the Jeeves and Wooster stories, or anyone who just likes a good laugh at the expense of the British, this series is wonderful. Both lead actors are exceptional, and Bertie's cast of friends is inspired. I'd recommend this set to anyone with a sense of humor.
044656740X|4.0|It had some excellent examples. And some revealing insights into our working lives and the rat race we run. The book was shorter than I expected and not as much educational info as I wouild have hoped.It did seem very much like Sharon was trying to somehow link all his thoughts noted down over the years into some form of flowing narrative. A basic starting point to discovering a new psychology but you'll need other books that will educate you further into going from being an everyday employee to what his rich dad was.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|I don't have much to say about season one of Clone Wars. I saw the movie version in the theaters that was supposed to be the first few episodes and thought it was entertaining. The dialogue was campy and it was obviously geared towards kids, but the action and fight sequences were surprisingly engaging and should appeal to any Star Wars fan. I'm about halfway done with season one and so far this seems like the lost Star Wars cartoon that was missing from my childhood. Clone Wars features most of the same characters from the newer trilogy (Anakin, Padme, Obi-Wan, Palpatine, Dooku, Grievous, Yoda, Mace, etc.) but also gives minor characters (like clone trooper Commander Cody or Jedi Master Plo Koon) a chance to show their significance within the Star Wars universe. One of the main characters is one who never appeared in the prequel trilogy: Anakin's padawan Ahsoka. Its interesting to see Anakin's skills as a Jedi mentor, a side we never quite saw in the movies. As a Star Wars fan I have been more than satisfied that the show decided to use other characters to drive the story, not just the same ones we have gotten to know over the course of three movies. Its different to see a story concentrating mostly on the Clones or on a random Jedi only seen in glimpses from the trilogy, but this is a high selling point for a fan like me who is not truly finished with Star Wars. The dialogue is still cheesy, the nicknames are stupid, and some of the situations seem impossible to get into or out of, but it is a fun show that I believe improves on what was a buzzkill of a prequel trilogy. Due to the limitless possibilities of the computer animation used in the show, the fight sequences and space battles are actually cooler to watch in the cartoon than in the movies (with the one exception being the Darth Maul duel of the fates from Phantom Menace). I would highly recommend this show to anyone who wanted more from the prequel trilogy or any fan still loyal and longing for more Star Wars adventures.

0446401307|4.0|Without ruining the end I will say that the best part of The Overlook is the ending. There are so many red herrings in this you will never guess what the end will be all about until you're almost two pages past it.  Just joking of course!     The Overlook is a fun thriller, the type you enjoy reading and are wondering yourself what will happen next.  It has moments of suspense mixed with great classic detective narratives. All in all this is a great and fun book and well worth your time. This book is tremendously fun and if you read for enjoyment you will love this!
B000H7JD4A|1.0|Those who thought the two Blaze albums would have been better if Bruce had sung on them should listen to this album.  The same problems that have plagued every Maiden album since 1995- needlessly slow intros, repetitive choruses, and overlong song structures- are on full display here.  The only two songs that stick out in any way are Out of the Shadows, which is actually quite nice (though very similar to Bruce's solo song The Tears of the Dragon), and Lord of Light, which is practically the only song on the album with any sense of energy.  Most of the rest of the songs are plodding, sleep-inducing \\"prog metal\\" wanna-be tracks that sound like outtakes from the previous two albums.  For hardcore fans or completists only.
1442192461|5.0|Many literary critics have proclaimed Emma to be the most accomplished of Jane Austen's novels.  That may well be, but I don't personally number it among my favorites.  That said, it easily deserves its five-star rating; I haven't read an Austen novel yet that doesn't.<br /><br />Emma is, of course, the story of beautiful, young, wealthy and accomplished Emma Woodhouse.  Of her, too many kindnesses can not be said.  At least, that is the attitude displayed by everyone around Emma.  She's heard nothing but praise and exaltations her entire life, and has come to quite believe her own billing.  And while she generally means well, Emma has grown into an unforgivable busybody and snob.<br /><br />Emma lavishes most of her attentions on her dear friend Harriet Smith.  While Harriet is of a lower status and desirability than Emma herself, Emma feels confident she can improve upon Harriet, introduce her to all the right society, in short, make her a most advantageous match.  Never mind the perfectly nice farmer who is already in love with her.<br /><br />And so, Emma insinuates herself into the affairs of Harriet and several others around her.  She is certainly not the most sympathetic of Austen's heroines and my feelings about her tended to fluctuate from chapter to chapter.  Nevertheless, no conflicted feelings got in the way of the joy brought about by a patented Austen ending.  Additionally, Austen proves yet again that humor based on an intimate knowledge of human nature is timeless.  I defy you not to laugh over the antics of Emma's possessive and gruel-loving father.  Austen's social satire is as sharp as it ever was.

B000063DHL|1.0|If I wanted to hear a loud mass of indiscriminate white noise I'd listen to a Nine Inch Nails album.  When I listen to an Iron Maiden album I'd actually like to hear the singer and the individual instruments layered on one another.  This 2002 remaster is overly loud, compressed, and digitized.  Stick with the original CD.

0670021652|5.0|My daughter who writes a blog called The Late Bloomer Bride introduced me to this book, and actually interviewed me out of it, because she wanted to know how I could be so happy after four marriages...Well, just like Elizabeth Gilbert says, \\"It's a game.\\"  You just have to know the rules and play it.  She knows them, and she is such a great player.

B000063DIH|3.0|Remove the filler songs Fear is the Key, Childhood's End, The Fugitive, The Apparition, and Weekend Warrior and you have a great eight-track hard rock/metal album.  Unfortunately, these weak tracks bring the album down and prolong it to an unreasonable 13 tracks, which is too much for a band like Iron Maiden, who always do better with eight or nine track albums.  Overall though, Fear of the Dark is an okay album, and easily the best of Maiden's 90s efforts.
0393072231|5.0|This is a well written account of some of the most fascinating people running against the \\"common wisdom\\" of the financial world. It's the kind of book that has you saying to your nearest & dearest \\"listen to this.\\" Lewis explains a lot of the mystery behind subprime loans, rating agencies, and Credit Default Swaps. He also explains why a lot of this was deliberately confusing. There are good guys and bad guys and a oddly, a lot of actually funny moments in this book.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I thought when Cannibal Corpse kicked out former vocalist Chris Barnes, it was the best move they ever did, although I quite like Butchered at Birth, Tomb of the Mutilated, and The Bleeding as they are all great albums, but I feel Chris Barnes was holding them back, which is why everyone said 'Cannibal Corpse release the same album over and over' even with Barnes they did change, I mean you listen to Tomb of the Mutilated, and then listen to The Bleeding, it's quite different, but anyways, onto the album at hand.    In 2002, Cannibal Corpse released Gore Obsessed, which was a great album, I got that when it came out, and I just got this album...yeah, I'm late I know, but better late than never! I knew because it was Cannibal Corpse I would not be disappointed, and I wasn't at all, and that is stated right off in 'Severed Head Stoning' kicks off the album in a thrashing fury, this is your typical fast as all hell Cannibal Corpse song, 'Psychotic Precision' is next and continues the furious assault of brutal catchy riffs and awesome vocals, this song contains some excellent tempo changes, 'Decency Defied' slows things down a bit to a mid-paced stomper, this song is heavy as a ton of bricks, those guitar hooks are crazy.    'Frantic Disembowelment' gets things thrashing again, this song is fast and fun, and a catchy chorus, 'The Wretched Spawn' is next, and starts with some slow brooding riffs that just bludgeon your ears with heaviness, excellent riffs, drums, and of course the master Alex Webster on bass, he is simply an awesome bass player, one of my favorites, 'Cyanide Assassin' is another fun song with fun lyrics and riffs about, 'Festering in the Crypt' IS THIS CANNIBAL CORPSE?! wow, going from a brutal thrasher in the previous track, to this slow/doom/death song I would say, easily, the riffs are wicked doomish, this is a really killer track, one of my favorite Cannibal Corpse songs, and a little side note, George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher is a beast of a vocalist,and this track proves it.    All the songs are awesome, because it's Cannibal Corpse, they always manage to amaze me, both old and new CC, bottom line, if you heard 'Gallery of Suicide' and loved it as I did, you will love this one, as I find it similar.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Breaking Bad is one of the best shows on cable TV.  It is witty, funny, sarcastic, and a bit of dark humor.  Walt, the lead character, a high school chemistry teacher, finds out that he has terminal lung cancer.  To pay for his treatment he decides to be a cooker of Meth with a student of his.  That is where the mishaps and the fun begins.    Walt played by Bryan Cranston, the dad in Malcolm in the Middle is funny yet edgy.  Jesse the student is played by a lesser know actor, who is coming into his prime as an actor is comic relief in many ways and his anecdotes are priceless.    Overall this is a great series and should be continued as long as AMC can pay for it.    One other thing to note is that this DVD set is uncut, unlike the cable version, so it is actually a little better than the version seen on cable.  Why a cable network would produce something that gets censored on its network is beyond me, but the DVD captures the full essence of what the director is trying to say.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I love documentary movies, so I use to watch a lot this kind of films, Planet Earth is the best one I've ever saw.
0307454541|3.0|I hesitate to \\"review\\" this book because I suspect that much of my disappointment in it is due to the translation, which I have no way of evaluating since I would be unable to read it in Swedish; so consider that this is only about the U. S. version. Many sentences are distractingly awkward, with many questionable vocabulary choices.<br /><br />Published reviews and the jacket blurbs use terms such as \\"dazzling,\\" \\"frighteningly suspenseful,\\" and \\"page-turner,\\" none of which are adjectives I would use. Actually, it has a rather leisurely pace, and is very slow to get going.<br /><br />I do very much like the plot, which I think is quite original and interesting. It is very complex, but not so much so that you can't follow it. I was interested in the outcome, and found it to be believable. The descriptions of the country and, of course, the cold, are very well-done and give the reader a real sense of place.<br /><br />One thing that did bother me especially is that we are never told exactly why Lisbeth is the type of person she is. There are hints of course, but was the author saving that expos&eacute; for a sequel? A lesser complaint is with so many characters in the story (which is confusing enough), I wonder why the author chose to have two named \\"Greger,\\" which forced me to backtrack a few chapters so see if I remembered correctly who the other one was.<br /><br />And, for anyone who hasn't read this: the book is replete with sadistic sex and torture descriptions and scenes. I'm not condemning the book for this, but I think people need to be aware of it if this isn't their cup of tea (as it isn't mine).
B000OVLBF8|5.0|I can't seem to put this movie up. I really enjoy watching this flick. Nicholas Cage plays fits this part to a cue.
B00275EGX8|5.0|If you're looking for a war movie filled with action, blood, dope-taking, brutality towards the enemy, and the like, this is not for you.  Suspense, however, there is. Edge of your seat suspense, created not only by the plot, this is about defusing bombs before they blow everyone up, but also by the cinematography.  Feet walking forward, first one booted foot, then another. Will the next step cause a hidden bomb to detonate?  We do see detonations, and they are awesome.  What is different about this war movie, set in Iraq, is it's not about seeing how many people our troops can  kill, but how many lives the bomb squad can save, even the lives of the \\"enemies,\\" who are not soldiers.  The movie echoes the weird situation in Iraq.  We are \\"fighting\\" an enemy without an army, and no reasons are given for our being there in the first place. The Iraqis we see are shepherds and peddlers and hustlers just trying to get by.<br /><br />The movie opens with the statement that \\"War is a drug\\" you get addicted to.  The protagonist is addicted to it, both to the danger of defusing bombs, and to being able to save lives.  When his tour is over, this self-assured young man is seen bewildered in the cereal aisle of a market in the US.  This is not his life.  Defusing bombs is.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent, showing the washed out vistas of the desert and the shimmering of the heat.  The forward tracking shots heighten the suspense.  It is not an anti-war film per se.  Rather, it is taken as a given that this \\"war\\" is senseless, but the soldiers who are there, do their duty without heroics or stunts.  One of the virtues of owning the disc is that we've been able to re-watch it to get all of its subtleties.  It stands up to repeated viewings. In fact, my husband found it even better the second and third times around.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|A great concert....Cliff and the Shadows appeared to have fun performing their favorites (most of them from 1960's). A lot of great songs (42). I highly recommend this DVD for fans of Cliff Richard and fans of the Shadows.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Renting them from Netflix, but I could not help to add these into my library.<br /><br />The plot in all its continuation is amazing, to say the least! It is in a smooth, constant flow and it brings the viewer into the shoes of Bourne as he tries to fit all the puzzle pieces back together. You cannot help to feel that emotional connection throughout his journey and this is one of the reasons why I am really intrigued. Action, adventure, thrills and twists, character development, and in moments when Bourne is taking a \\"rest\\" after a heavy chase (For example, when he gets on the train in Supremacy after the hectic chase), you will feel sympathy for him.<br /><br />** SPOILER ** When Bourne confronts the daughter of his earlier assignments, the mother and father, and tells her that he was the one who killed them (It was believed to be a murder-suicide and the general public believed it), this was and still is the most dramatic scene I will never forget! ** END SPOILER **<br /><br />The cinematography is well put also. More of a documentary style in the fighting (Awesome choreograph as it looks genuinely authentic) and chase (Cars included, LOL). It might be a bit nauseating from the shakiness to some, but I found it to be most exhilarating.<br /><br />The European scenery and architecture are all beautiful!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Slash returns with a new slab of smokin' rock n f'n roll. Ian Asbury is the 1st of the guest vocallists and hasn't lost any of the swagger he possesed while fronting the Cult. Ozzy's up next, and sounds almost hauntingly subdued. Awesome! Fergie rocks her pretty ass off! Powerful stuff. Move over Ann Wilson!  Myles Kennedy does 2 cuts, and should be Velvet Revolvers new singer. Way better than Weiland and myles (get it) better than the other \\"Scott\\" his last band members made the mistake of reuniting with. A truely phenominal voice. Chris Cornell's collaberation is way better than his was with Timbaland. Wolfmother's Andrew Stockdale is the diamond in the rough. Not really well known but that will change. Adam Levine is as smooth as a baby's ass. Truely a voice to make the girls moist. Lemmy!!!! Enough said. Watch This Dave is the only instrumental track and features Duff McCagen and Dave Grohl. Loose and grrrreeeeaaaassssy. Kid Rocks next and doesn't dissapoint. Two of detroits best blow on this excellent piece of work, as Iggy does the closer. Not to forget M Shadows on Nothing to Say. Ha! Now there's a play on words. Rocco Deluca as has some heavy hangers. Slash is as good as he always is. He is the best guitar player since Rhodes, Van Halen, and Jimmy Page. It's too bad Axel could'nt partiscipate. That's the only way this disc could have been better. Put that in your pipe and smoke it! Later.

B000000OQF|5.0|Not much to say that hasn't probably already been said, but this is the greatest rock album ever made. From start to finish there is not one bad moment. You can take the greatest hits of about any other band and it will not be better than this album. It is that simple. If these guys could have stayed together longer they could have been the greatest band of all-time. They still might be even with the few albums they put out.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This video was so thought provoking.  So few of us have a good idea where our food comes from or how it was produced.  Most of our nutrition education is limited to TV commercials selling us \\"healthy\\" fast food or \\"natural\\" factory-farmed fat-filled meat products.   And then we wonder why America is the fattest country in the world.  It's true that about 1 in 3 American kids born today will end up with Diabetes Type 2 at some point.   DM Type 2 isn't just something annoying that prevents you from eating cookies: it's a terrible disease, a top cause of blindness & amputations, and a very high risk for cardiovascular/HTN problems.   Just like the family in the video illustrated DM Type 2 is very costly to control.    Their medications were \\"hundreds\\" of dollars a month.  Yet they continue to eat fast-food at most meals.   What they don't understand is that $200-$300 a month goes a long way into buying healthy food choices.   Food can be prepared in advance, then frozen, so time is no excuse.   People just aren't educated on what not to eat.  And when the only ads we see are from big agri-business, no wonder we're confused?    I am deeply troubled by the increasing food industry power.  They've already taken away 1st Amendment rights: it's now illegal to openly discuss food production/industry topics (even if they're TRUE), if the discussion hurts the corporation's sales figures.   How is this even constitutional?   This is the same government who has cut USDA inspections down to a fraction of what they were decades ago, even though population and food intake only goes up.      I also am troubled that in light of the role of lifestyle in health, that nobody is talking about diet during our current healthcare debates.   Why didn't part of the new Health Care bill touch on things brought up in this movie?  And why are my tax dollars being used to provide feed corn to feedlots at below market cost?  Corn has been so cheap that people are even burning it to heat their homes (corn stoves).   How about we stop wasting tax money on corn and if we want to subsidize something that counts, we use it only for healthy food choices such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, foods free of HFCS, non-factory-farmed animal products, etc.      The movie is interesting.  I think if you buy it for your whole family to watch, you won't get bored.  It is thought provoking.    I first watched it on Netflix and it was so good, I ordered a copy from Amazon to share with my friends.   People need to know this stuff.  It's true: you are what you eat.

B0026IA0QS|1.0|I'm a big fan of Alejandro Jodorowsky, probably the only thing I haven't seen is is film \\"Tusk,\\" I own a VHS copy of The Rainbow Thief, which was never released on dVD. I also have the Box set of El Topo, Holy Mountain which looks terrfic. But this transfer of Santa Sangre on to DVD suffers from bad pal artifiacts, and the sound is crummy. Whenever there is a long pan, it looks like it was done on video rather than film. I own the original laserdisc, which is much better as far as the continuity and sound. I would say wait until either Criterion or another company like Anchor Bay releases this on either Blu Ray or remastered DVD format. Either that, or get the laserdisc if you can, the resolution is much better than this dvd.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|Glen and Marketa have done it again.  They have combined their talents to create a masterpiece filled with laid back as well as upbeat harmonies.  I can't think of any way to adequately describe the album, I just know that if you're a fan, you'll absolutely adore the work.  It definitely gives me the chills and warm fuzzies that only the voices of Swell Season can give me.

B000025OG6|4.0|With this album, Toto show their ability to just play good ol' fashioned rock 'n roll, but with the melodic grace and structure of their earlier works.  Gone are Bobby K. and Joseph W., leaving Luke to take up the lead vocals, and he goes about his work in competent, if not inspiring, fashion.  What IS inspiring is his guitar work.  Man, can that dude play!  It is not the band's best album, but it is a necessary addition to any fan's collection, as you really cannot understand and appreciate the evolution from Toto I to Tambu without hearing it.
B00005K3NR|5.0|If you are a Stephen King fan, this is a must have! It will definately keep your attention! I would not recommend that you let children under 13 watch it. The first time I saw it ,many moons ago, I had a few nightmares about it. the hand coming up out of the grave at the end scared the begeebers out of me!

B00129H7VS|5.0|Perfect TV series, I've had it about a month now and I've already watched it about 3 times. probably wouldn't bother with the blue ray though if I had it to do again since the series was made before HD. I watched it on HD and it virtually made no difference. But this is definitely a smart purchase.
B0007TKNCY|4.0|i really enjoyed watching this, although I think the short story is a bit better. The item was in excellent shape, although there was a tear about a half-inch in length on the top of the case, probably due to shipping or something. The movie was perfectly fine, though.
B002VECM6S|5.0|You don't get many movies these days that are really good, no sex, no cursing, and no violence.  It's a true story to boot!  What a great family movie and so heart warming.  Even my college son loved it.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|John Adams. Sadly while the movie makes some historical revisions in character and misses or overlooks other important facts, the movie series itself is truly a love story in the birth of a Nation and of husband and wife and of friendship. After reading many of the reviews of this miniseries I have become torn and inquisitive. The miniseries John Adams, and the before mentioned, has now inspired me to read the book of the same title by David McCullough and other historical documentation of the time, like the Constitution.
B001OQCV2O|3.0|We actually enjoyed this movie.  It reminded us of movies we have seen in the past such as Independence Day.  While it is a bit \\"far-fetched\\", we found it entertaining.  The sound track was great.
B0018O4YSQ|1.0|I was greatly disappointed with this film, although it boast a great actor listing the movement and story line were flat.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I first saw this movie in cinema and i really loved the movie, Sandra Bullocks performance is outstanding, she deserved the oscar! More amazing is that this story is a true story and i loved the fact of a rich family taking a poor boy in and help him out and even adopt him. It proves us that eventhough people might be poor, they can be helped by the rich. Of course people gotta earn trust and that's what Michael Oher did, he earned the trust from the family.     I would watch this movie over and over again, that's why i had to buy this dvd as well...
B001YB29HG|5.0|I bought this DVD knowing only that it was the brain child of the Whedon's and a musical.  I loved the Buffy musical episode enough to buy the soundtrack and was expecting the same quality and variety in this film.  I must say, I was somewhat disappointed.  I didn't think there was as much variety in the film music, genre-wise, as was in the Buffy musical.  Though I enjoyed the film, I was prepared to give it three stars here.  It was enjoyable, but nothing spectacular.  I figured that first I should check out the features and saw Commentary! The Musical.<br /><br />It was everything I dreamed, and more!  Commentary! The Musical is, of course, the DVD commentary you'd expect, but by all of the cast done entirely in a musical format that is HILARIOUS and quite the variety of music.  The lyrics were hysterical; I laughed the whole commentary. I was expecting a couple of songs, but was delighted to discover that they actually did a whole film-length musical (all the way through the credits, too!) that is just gut-busting funny musical commentary.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.  It was over the top in the best way.<br /><br />So, for those buying this expecting the Buffy variety/quality of musical, you won't find quite that level in the film, but you will find that and more in the commentary.<br /><br />Here's the link to buy the soundtrack for the commentary: [[ASIN:B003327DR0 Commentary! The Musical]].
1897093527|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a series of short stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle to be published in serial format in The Strand Magazine. They are each complete unto themself, so if you missed one you could still go out and get the next one without much of a bother. The character Sherlock Holmes became much beloved in England over this and people even wrote into the magazine asking if he was a real man (to which the editor gave a suitably vague response). Sherlock Holmes solves mysteries through logic and observation, and oftentimes just had to hear about a case to piece together what happened, he is famous for his large magnifying glass, his tall lanky figure, and of course his pipe. His is still the figure people think of when they think of a detective even today.    The plots are sometimes weak, but often intricate and they leave you guessing until the final plot twist at the end as to who did what and how. Occasionally you can guess early just what is going on but you still want to read on because you find you care about what happens to Holmes and Watson and whatever other innocents become involved in the case and you need to see what happens next! If you love mysteries you need to give this classic an honest try. It's highly readable, and well worth a go. You won't be disappointed.

0439023491|5.0|This was a very worthy sequel to The Hunger Games. It was just as action packed as the first, with all of the same favorite characters brought back to vivid life, only this time we get to journey to new places as Katniss and Peeta do their Victory Tour and get to see all of the other districts and the unrest that is stirring in each of them.<br /><br />It was interesting reading about the effect the Hunger Games had on each of the other districts as they meet the families of the fallen and watch the unrest that results from their passing through. Katniss' survival instincts lead her to try her best to make it appear that their defiance was all a part of a wild love affair but when push comes to shove she finds herself just as instinctively following her heart and feeding the flames of a world catching fire.<br /><br />I think in many ways this book was more tense than the previous. There are higher stakes at play. Instead of Katniss just attempting to save her life she is attempting to save the life of her family and her district as well. In a lot of ways though she is still just a teenage girl. She doesn't understand all that is at stake and she doesn't realize that just saving herself, her family and her close friends is just not going to cut it anymore. Everyone in the country is involved now and it has all gone too far to go back now. She is the icon of revolution and, in a surprisingly believable way, doesn't even realize it.<br /><br />The storyline is mesmerizing and it keeps you flipping pages late into the night. I finished this book in one crazy sitting when I stupidly cracked the book open at 9 at night and stayed up until the small hours to finish. The plot is fast paced, the characters are sympathetically drawn and will tug at your heart strings, the world is described in a wonderfully realistic way and the ending will leave you breathless. If you have not started this series yet I strongly recommend reading The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. The third book, Mockingjay is coming out this August and the movie is coming out in another year or so. Everyone will be talking about this series by next year, you don't want to miss out on this.book, Mockingjay is coming out this August and the movie is coming out in another year or so.

B0029QRA1U|4.0|Really no complaints. The user should have a decent degree of computer literacy to use the editing software, but all in all, it does what it is advertised to do. It also helps that it has a built in pre-amp to connect to the more modern receivers which do not have a specific input for a phono. The built in duist cover is also a nice feature - I had bought an earlier model that did not have this. I would like a cueing lever to slowly place the tone arm on a designated (usually the beginning) point of an LP, and an automatic tone arm return for the end of the record (I had these features on older turntables/changers - maybe just on changers?). It is much easier to connect a turntable to a USB port on a laptop than to have to go through the gyrations of connecting to an audio input (all I have on mine is a microphone input and I don't know if this is a mono or stereo input). Like many people, my desktop PC is not located anywhere near my entertainment center, so the USB connection is a great feature, since I can use it with my laptop. All in all, highly recommended.
B0030ZOYHC|2.0|This was my first taste of \\"anime\\" and while the visuals are very nice the black lines mimicing lips were too unnatural to me. The story was too complicated and not entertaining at all.

B0037W68F4|1.0|I don't exactly know what compositional elements must be integrated into music to give it a good melody. What exactly makes a tune pleasing to the ear? With two songs, both comprising of five notes on a diatonic scale, how can one song simply sound better than the other? These questions came to mind as I, a big fan of Oracular Spectacular, listened to MGMT's latest major studio album. Though many (often pretentious listeners) will remark about their \\"Big Three\\" (`Time to Pretend', `Kids', `Electric Feel') not being MGMT's true sound or not their best work, I think the group owes it to their fan base, as broad as it is, to create more of these melodic, catchy, timeless tracks. Without them, Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden would be nothing more than just two random, worthless Wesleyan nerds, with a guitar and an effects pedal, a free version of GarageBand on their MacBook, and all the normal stresses of college/post-college life to look forward to. Instead, they were nominated for three Grammy's and hailed as the writers of Rolling Stone's 18th best album of the 2000s. This would certainly not be the case with their more alternative rock sounds heard in Congratulations. It's their synth-pop, synthesizer dominating, highly complex electronic sonic qualities that we love and remember about MGMT, not their Indie alternative side heard here.  In that respect, they've failed.    Again, this album takes a more alternative slant than their previous Electronic Dance/synth-pop sound of their more well known work, though the first track, \\"It's Working\\", does have a new-psychedelic fell the 2007 album displayed. But that's pretty much as far as the comparison can go. \\"Song for Dan Treacy\\" is a rock piece, though they do add some melodic commentary of their original appeal, incorporating some early electronic music sounds, such as the telharmonium that can be heard a minute in. Computer modular sounds take over at the end, suggesting that perhaps the group hasn't completely abandoned its roots. Still, as mentioned above, the melodies heard are not nearly as carefully constructed as MGMT's more popular work; the tunes are simply not as pleasing.    Goldwasser provides the lead vocals instead of backups in \\"Someone's Missing\\", starting with an acoustic guitar and is driven into a digital piece, which is the only positive about the song. Their digital origins show again in \\"Flash Delerium\\", beginning with a theremin, the second reference to early electronic music. Perhaps this is the groups way of making known their musical transience. The telharmonium and theremin paved the way for evolution of technosonic music, from musique concrete to electronic sound. MGMT could be acknowledging their relevance, and pointing out their own evolution as artists, moving instead backwards from digitally derived music to more traditional alternative rock. While \\"Siberian Breaks\\" provides a glimmer of hope with its purely electronic melody halfway through, it all goes awry once the next boring Indie-rock \\"Brian Eno\\" track begins.     The only redeeming qualities of Congratulations are their references to their electronic beginnings: some musique concrete of Karlheinz Stockhausen heard in the piano of the entirely instrumental \\"Lady Dada's Nightmare\\", the theremin made famous by Clara Rockmore, and some Alternative Dance styles of Kraftwerk. That being said, Congratulations incorporates nothing close to the melodic brilliance they showed in their previous work, for which they owe their namesake. I'm not exactly sure what they were thinking with the final song, which shares its name with the album's title. Being their most traditional rock piece ever, they're saying \\"Congratulations\\" to their success and notoriety of their previous album; it's hard to tell whether or not this is some sort of sarcastic statement by the group, as the song in no way represents their older work, both in style and in execution. The only \\"congratulations\\" relevant here is one for getting their first flop of an album out of the way.

It is based on the true story of Japan's beloved National Treasure (and icon) the Akita, a beautiful breed of dog that dates back more than 4,000 years, and was almost lost after WWII.<br />  Richard Gere and Joan Allen are perfect as the professor and his wife who live in New England with their daughter. Of course the numerous Japanese Akitas who play the part of Hachi, at various stages of life from puppy to old age are all lovable \\"baby bears!\\"<br />  Blu-ray increases the visual pleasure of the beautifully shot scenes of snowfalls and all four New England seasons.This is the telling of a tale both true and poignant, of a man with his dog, while detailing the impact a pet can have over generations, upon a family.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun!  i loved the setting in New Orleans, and i loved the characters.  How fun to have something take place in the states for a change.  I had to laugh at a lot of the negative reviews...did any of them watch the film?  If you dont care for Jazz, then of course you wont be a big fan of the music...but it works wonderfully with the setting, the time period and the movie.  Why does all the music have to sound the same from film to film anyways...I thought the songs were fun.  Anika Noni Rose has a beautiful voice!  I love the hard working Tiana and i was pleased with the friendship between her and the rich girl, Charlotte.  I loved that there was no jealousy or bitterness, which seems to be the norm in most films.  A warm and wonderful film!  Thanks for keeping with the 2D animation...and thanks for another winner Disney!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I picked this up not really knowing what it was. Was it a history channel type documentary or was it more akin to the Band of Brothers storytelling?<br />I'm certainly not disappointed that I did. This is an excellent mini-series detailing the race to the moon from different perspectives. It's not just the astronauts or the NASA's perspective on it but it shows the politics behind it, a whole episode dedicated to the wifes of astronauts etc.<br />Extremely good.  I was a little disappointed by the Apollo 13 episode whereby it was taken from the perspective of a news reporter but in hindsight it was good to see the perspective of others.<br />Overall an excellent mini-series, historically accurate with some great real footage mixed in with stage and visual effects, blended masterfully.<br />Recommended to anyone who wants to know more about what happened during the USA's four short years of manned space missions ending with the last man to set foot on the moon.
0345409671|5.0|I highly recommend Memnoch the Devil for many reason, with the most important being the uniqueness and daring of this story to go somewhere most would never dare to approach.  Yes, that is the Christian Heaven and Hell.  Before you say you wouldn't like to go there, that it is not your belief system, or that Lestat is a vampire, so how can he fit into a religious framework, keep in mind who Lestat is.  For those of you who don't know him, he is a 17th French aristocrat, a country lord, and yes, as a mortal man, a Catholic.  And that is his weakness, if you can call it a weakness, that some creature has come to prey on in him within this novel. Like most of us, he has some unresolved guilt from the past and has a hunger for knowing what it is really all about. Well he gets to find out. Or does he?<br /><br />In this novel, you, too, will get the answers. Or more precisely, to the credit of the genius of Anne Rice, you will get to meet a Creature who SAYS he has the answers, that he is a great fallen angel, why that fate is so, and his many answers to how it all works and came about.  Rice does not make this a simple trip for Lestat or you, as the reader ---- another reason i love this book so much.  I adore the movie Agnes of God for this same reason.  You take away what you bring to it; for theologians, there are hidden treasures others will not even comprehend while reading this book. that is the prize and a lot more.<br /><br />Another reason I love this novel so much is because it is so intellectually honest.  Scientific minded, rational thinking people will appreciate her approach.  This is definitely not a fundamentalist edict to Jewish or Christian scripture. It's one I consider more valid, and one I suspect Lestat considers given this is the story he is given.  It's also an approach that Catholic Nuns actually taught me in school.  So it's also real Catholic theology, to the surprise of many. Yes, even the Catholic Church as some progressive ideas. We're not in the dark ages here with this novel, folks.<br /><br />And for Lestat, whether this is all the forever, eternal truth or just something this Memnoch is telling Lestat to get what he wants ----and boy, does Memnoch want something ---- Anne Rice will leave it up to you to decide some things.<br /><br />Another reason I am attracted to this novel is its strong relation to Rice's new adventures with Toby O'Dare in Angel Time.  They almost feel like companion pieces, though I love Angel Time even more for its greater interaction with people in its time travel. But with Memnoch the Devil, I want to call her Anne O'Dare.  This book is daring in broaching a subject most would run 180 degrees from. But then, again, this is a writer who has dared to go where no one else would many times before. Rice has always gone against the grain of conventional taste, be it vampires, witches, spirits, or even God; this is very reason she is the reining Queen of the Vampire Writers.  Again, she takes you an a journey you just have not been on.  That alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />But some may not like Memnoch the Devil.  It does challenge the reader to think and make some decisions.  If you want everything completely spelled out for you, stick to Stephenie Myers or Steven King.  If you want to engage with a work that keeps theologians up nights contemplating the possibilities, read Memnoch the Devil.

I understand that he felt the need to transform<br /> Holmes<br />to the 21 century,but was it necessary to change Holmes<br />into a totally unrecognizable character.I read the reviews<br />of this movie but still rented it only because of Downey.<br />He is a superb actor who I think would have done one heck<br />of an acting job if he had the chance to play Holmes the way<br />Doyle intended.As it was,even Downey couldn't save the horrendous<br />dialogue in this movie.<br />But,to me the worst part of this movie was the overall blackness<br />that was supposed to take us back to a different era.<br />I didn't buy an hdtv to sit and watch 2 hours of different shades<br />of black because the director was so-o-o inept that he couldn't<br />come up with any other way to give the viewer a feeling of<br />a period piece.<br />Don't waste your money on this one.<br />Get the Jeremy Brett version of Holmes.Yes he plays it over the top,but its fun to watch him doing it.
B002T45VX6|4.0|I love this album...Shakira's voice is so beautiful and her powerful \\"she wolf\\" pervades the title song. She is maturing and her voice is more sultry than ever. Times are a-changing and so is Shakira, but not for the worse, like some would have you believe! Shakira hasn't lost her spirit at all, it is just developing as a woman develops as she matures....So there - you naysayers!
B001UV4XWY|1.0|This movie started off promising and quickly went down hill. The plot was all over the place. Add in the horrible acting, or should I say overacting by Cameron Diaz and it becomes unbearable. It's a shame, because the premise seemed interesting. Press the button and someone you don't know dies, a million dollars would then be yours. After sitting through this, I couldn't help but think this would of made a better Twilight Zone episode. I know Rod Serling would of done it justice.
0316174483|5.0|I am a homeschooling mom and bought this book to try out some fun art/craft time with my daughter.  It was a hit!  We sat for hours doing the little thumb and fingerprint art.  Even I, Mom, got in on the action. (I was proud of my art also. hehe)  I  highly recommend this fingerprint art book to anyone young or old.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I have not seen the DVD or Blu-Ray, as they are not released yet, but I had to review this.<br /><br />I was talking with some co-workers and they told me they thought it would be like \\"Mystery Men\\". Though I like that movie too, this movie has more in common with \\"the Matrix\\" than \\"Mystery Men\\". I told them that before I saw it, and I was right. This movie is a kind of a kind of a Kill Bill version of Spiderman with more humor added. There is lots of comic relief, and that comedy is essential to the plot and pacing of the movie as a whole, but this is NOT simply a comedy. It IS, however, a boatload of FUN!<br /><br />It is essentially the meshing of two stories that both have the same premise: \\"What would happen if someone actually tried to be a super hero?\\"<br /><br />In one story we get the tale of an everyman high school kid who loves comic books. He wants to \\"put on a suit and help people\\". He's a dreamer that means well, but is generally incompetent. So this part of the story is based on what happens when his fantasy gets smacked in the face by the cold hard fist of reality.<br /><br />The second story is the tale of a competent and smart man that is horribly wronged and seeks revenge. The catch is he has a very young daughter. Like Lone Wolf and Cub he decides to take her with him on his planned journey to hell, only he is smart enough to give her the tools she will need to survive the trip. This part of the story is simple and pure, and you have seen it many times before. The film makers wisely don't embelish it to much, but we do get some exposition and notworthy scenes. Most of this story is left in subtext.<br /><br />So, what happens when the two stories collide? AWESOMENESS! This is written and performed so well that the stories simply mesh without clashing. I have never seen anything pull this off so well. There are plenty of gritty semi-realistic action scenes, and a little bit of ridiculousness thrown in for good measure. This movie Satisfies with a capital S. The violence is slightly more graphic than the Matrix, but not as intense as Sin City, 300, or Kill Bill. Yes, profanity is there, but there are not as many F-Bombs being dropped as I have seen reported. It's just that much of the profanity comes from the mouth of an 11 year old girl... (Which by the way should not even be allowed to SEE this movie for another 4-5 years!) You should definitely watch it before you allow any child of yours under 16 see it! COME ON! Be a parent already!<br /><br />I want to add: I saw the Dark Knight movie and I recognized it was a groundbreaking piece of work, but when I left the theatre afterward I just felt depressed. Where was the fun? It was a good movie, but I did not enjoy it, and have not seen it since. Kick-Ass is both an awesome movie and a GREAT TIME! I left the theatre just thinking how soon could I see it again, and who could I share it with next time.<br /><br />There is at least one reviewer that panned this film because it was not EXACTLY the same as the graphic novel. I used to be like that too, but now I realize that some things work better on the big screen than in a book. He lists the changes, and from what he states, I think I like the movie better than the book. I never read the graphic novel and I am glad I saw the movie first. From his description, I may have skipped the movie had I read the comic first. He complains and gripes that he hates when movies change comics. This is unwarranted. I have seen an interview with the writers that basically state that the screenplay was written more or less concurrently with the comic, just that Millar was primary in writing the comic while Vaughn was primary in writing the screenplay. They collaborated throughout on both, and a movie was always in mind. So, that comic book \\"purist\\" needs to get a life! THIS MOVIE ROCKS!<br /><br />The director needs to do more films, and he, Chloe Moretz and Nicholas Cage deserve Oscar nods, but it won't happen. Hit Girl is written to steal the show, but it could not have been done so well without Chloe's dead on performance. There is not a bad performance in this film. Leave the kiddies at home.ave been done so well without Chloe's dead on performance. There is not a bad performance in this film. Leave the kiddies at home.
B0029LHW68|5.0|What can I say about this album? This is simply amazing. All the songs and all the lyrics is truly inspiring.  I want to thank the guys of creating such a moving album and to see them perform and bring all emotions and feeling is what makes this band so special. I can't wait to see them again. And for all the bad reviews....you just don't know what real music is. Great job guys!!! I truly want to see you succeed to the max!
B002GYS1FO|5.0|I fell in love with the driving beat of \\"How You Like Me Now\\", the song played in the Kia Sorrento commercial with the sock monkey. I bought the CD based soley on that. The rest of the album is awesome. The drummer is one of the best I have ever heard. You will not be dissapointed. This band is way underrated. I look forward to the day that they make it big.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was looking for a new fitness video (I own approx. 60) and I saw the reviews for this video and thought I'd try it.  I am not overweight, but would like to lose 3-5lbs.  This workout is easy to squeeze in 5-6 days a week, and the circuit type of training gives a complete workout.  Since I started using the videos 3 weeks ago.  My thighs have a bit more tone, my butt is bit more lifted, and my stomach, arms and shoulders has more definition.  This has been a lot more effective than my pilates classes!
B003EVFALQ|5.0|As parents, we tend to embarass our children. What was perfect when they were younger seems strange when they reach the teenage years. I doubt my 16-year-old daughter relishes her baby pictures being incorporated into undergrad lectures or having me forever reviving a chant poem about her first words uttered in 1994. Imagine then, having your pop icon mama composing an expensive and expansive 26-song album in your honor. But that's just the artistic blessing of being born Natalie Merchant's daughter.<br /><br />Released on April 13, Leave Your Sleep dances into our waking dreams as the kind of epic project that only a unique literary and musical genius on extended maternity leave could compose. Costing thousands and thousands to produce and involving hundreds of collaborating musicians, Leave Your Sleep enchants, educates, and enthralls. Merchant confesses to finding the songs to resuscitate poems in her mind while nursing her now six-year-old daughter.<br /><br />With a tip of the bonnet to William Blake, the album opens with Charles Causley's \\"Nursery Rhyme of Innocence and Experience.\\" Immediately, listeners know that Natalie Merchant does not confine her craft to the carseat of genres called \\"kid's albums.\\" With Leave Your Sleep, our hearts swim in a deep well of serious folk music and not a single chirpy singalong to annoy parents on long drives can be found among these 26 tracks.<br /><br />The more clever tracks could border on the cute but never in a cringe-worthy way. Collaborating with Medeski, Martin, and Wood on the swingy \\"It Makes A Change,\\" Merchant marvels us with Mervyn Peake's whimsical meditations on a whale \\"feeling high and mighty\\" wearing \\"Aunt Mabel's nighty.\\" The poem \\"lights up the breakfast table,\\" and I haven't felt this good about dancing while planning the morning meal since Poi Dog Pondering's jubilant take on \\"Toast and Jelly.\\"<br /><br />From turning Ogden Nash's \\"Adventures of Isabel\\" into a fiddle-fired Appalachian jam or giving William Brighty Rands' \\"Topseyturvey-World\\" a worldly ska-reggae beat, Merchant confirms the musical diversity and visionary versatility that's been embedded in her creative DNA since the earliest 10,000 Maniacs records.<br /><br />With a litany of flavors to make Ben and Jerry weep and a wordplay that would amaze even Dr. Seuss, Jack Prelutsky's \\"Bleezer's Ice Cream\\" funks along to a downtown ragtime vibe. A poem about a person Merchant dubs a \\"badass dude,\\" \\"Peppery Man\\" began as an Irish jig but gets a gospel-blues treatment enhanced by the voices of the great gospel group Fairfield Four. The teacherly Merchant doesn't fancy a preacher's son but joyfully serenades \\"The Janitor's Boy,\\" a Nathalia Crane poem placed in the same room with Wynton Marsalis trumpet riffs.<br /><br />The haunting treatment of Lydia Huntley Sigourney's \\"Indian Names\\" shows that Merchant has hardly lost her earnest, activist edge. While some tracks get pure injections of innocent frivolity, Merchant researched the epic release with the diligence of an unemployed English major seeking a doctoral dissertation commisioned by the heavens.vey-World\\" a worldly ska-reggae beat, Merchant confirms the musical diversity and visionary versatility that's been embedded in her creative DNA since the earliest 10,000 Maniacs records.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|Sorry, I can't be impartial here.  I like auto racing;  I like Formula One racing;  I like historic racing films;  I like Cinerama;  and James Garner is one of my favorite actors.  Filmed on location at the various race circuits in Europe and using footage from several of the actual 1967 Formula One races, this film features many actual F1 drivers of the era in bit parts.  Skip the interminable musical intro.
B000FVE3AC|4.0|Great watch, very solidly made and an eye catcher!  It's big, so it makes a statement.  It keeps great time and the Miyota movement is very reliable.  You just can't beat this watch for the price!      One downside to Invicta... the service dept. I ordered an extra link for another watch over a month ago, and it still has not arrived... even after being told the part was in stock!

0143116738|5.0|I saw Ken Robinson being interviewed on TV a few weeks ago and he was discussing his book, The Element.  I was intrigued by what he had to say and ordered the book.  The main idea that interested me was that intelligence can be manifested in many ways. Not everyone does well on the standard academic assessment tests and should not be considered less than intelligent because of their scores. The book contains many stories of people who have found their \\"element\\" and succeeded in realizing their potential. This is an important book to read, not only for parents who have a child that has trouble finding his/her way academically, but for some of us late bloomers who are just now finding an opportunity for the growth and development of our natural talents.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|The PX21 was not released until Mar of 2010.  All of these review dated before that are for a different headset.  I love these.  My kids got these for me.  Since they are wired, NO CHARGING and they won't die in the middle of the game.  I have nothing bad to say.  They rock.  I hear people behind me.  The game and chat volume are separately controlled and there is a mute button.  I really like them.

1401323820|2.0|Start with the program Castle, use a plot that would not require more than a 1 hour TV program (45 minutes without commercials), add in too much of Nikkki's thoughts and temptations about Rook, and you end up with a novel that has little particular quality or interest beyond its link to Castle.

B0000667RO|3.0|I like Bryan Adams' music but I must say, this CD was a bit slow paced even for me.  I was nearly put to sleep by most of the songs.  It left me wanting for more, which I know he is capable of delivering.  Not your typical Bryan Adams you're used to.  This one is not one of my favorite Bryan Adams CD.
0800141660|5.0|I love this movie and enough has been said about it that I will stick to my one beef/warning.    The Special Features have two audio commentary selections, one with Emma Thompson and one with Ang Lee the director and James Shamus the co-producer.    The commentary with Emma Thompson gives a lot of insight to the making of the film and the writing of the script, which is wonderful.    The commentary with Ang Lee and James Shamus is horrible!!! James Shamus talks over Ang Lee and one hardly gets to hear from the director himself. THREE TIMES in the first FIVE MINUTES of the commentary Ang Lee has to tell James Shamus that they are there to TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE because Shamus immediately goes into his political soapbox mode. Shamus ignores this and goes on to make such comments as \\"There is something so creepy about a man who carries a knife and polishes a gun\\", referring to the character of Col. Brandon. Then Shamus goes on about how this is a feminist movie, and that the Evil British Empire and Evil America were all about slaves and nothing else...sigh...    There is a time and place for politics, but I wanted to hear about the FILM and to hear it from the director, not the self-centered Shamus who continually interrupted Lee, continually brought the conversation back to his political views, and disallowed any real discussion of the film.    Ang Lee is a respected filmmaker. It would have been a treasure to hear from him, his insights, if it hadn't been for the enormous conceit of the co-producer. Why this is a \\"special\\" feature, I do not know.

B002T45VX6|3.0|During the last decade, Shakira has gone from topping the South American charts to becoming a household name in the International music industry and sharing a place among the Britney's, Christina's, Jessica's, Madonna's, Beyoncè's and now upcoming stars as Ke$ha and Lady Gaga. Ironically, she dyed her hair blonde when she her first international album and with that huge success, it was easy to put her in the same category as Britney and Christina. But one of the things that have distinguished Shakira from her female colleagues is her actual genuine talent and her artistic originality and integrity. She may have a sexual image, but does a belly dancing with a grace and sensuality, plays various instruments and writes good lyrics, in addition. Compared to Britney and Christina, Shakira actually has the «it»-factor you got to have to stand out in the music industry.     But the «it»-factor isn't enough; you've got to have a distinctive voice and catchy songs, too. Fortunately, both components has always been Shakira's trademark, although, from an objective standpoint, she has the bad habit of muddling her songs in a mix of eclectic and exotic sounds, along with mixing rhythms from ethnic folk music. And in this crazy music world where pale and generic electronic/dance music is the big thing, it seems to affect almost all of the international, female artists. And now, unfortunately, it also has affected Shakira.     It has been four years since her last album. As a fan, you always hope to see a positive result, although it's hard for an artist to surpass themselves during many albums. So the question is, has Shakira outdone herself on her latest album? The answer is no - but still with a doubt.     «She Wolf» isn't a terrible album, but it does appear as muddled as a whole. Only a few songs does distinguish themselves; First out the main single «She Wolf», which I didn't cared for at first, but has grown on me (although the video appeared just as a vague reasonfor Shakira to sexualize herself). Next is the energetic and electronic «Men In This Town», which melodically resembles one of her previous songs, «Las de la Intuicion». The third one is the fast-paced «Mon Amour», which is influenced by some rock elements. «Gypsy» has also a sweet and catchy tune, although it's far from her most memorable song.     The rest of the album isn't much to brag about. None of the other songs are exactly bad, but they appear as cold, calculated and uninteresting. Once again, Shakira is mixing different sounds on her songs, but without making good and memorable melodies. Neither does Wyclef Jean increase the quality on their duet «Spy». But on the positive side, Shakira's English is better than ever, but is it really necessary to have her Spanish versions of her singles on the same album? Why can't she just release a Spanish album?     With that consideration aside, «She Wolf» (which is a strange, English formulation) comes off as a mild disappointment. Not exactly horrendous, but not exactly as acceptable as her previous albums. It would have been nice if she putted more spirit and heart into the whole album, instead of attempting at a half-calculated and polished album. Let's cross our fingers and let's hope that her next album will be better.
B00337KM2S|1.0|I read Walter Kirn's book when it came out a couple of years ago; I found it meandering and that the author strained to be quirky and hip.  Kind of like the aging hipster everyone knows who is purposefully outrageous in a desperate attempt to get an increasingly distinterested audience to continue to pay attention. (Chuck Palahniuk, I'm looking at you.) After passing on it at the theater, I succumbed to Oscar hype and just saw the movie on DVD; after all, how could a movie with three acting nominations (George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick) be that bad.  Now that I have seen it, I can safely report that, yes, it is that bad.     My impressions of the movie:    (i) The movie really is character driven, which is to say that inasmuch as it really doesn't have much of a plot to move the movie forward, it relies on engaging audiences in character development rather than plot development (i.e. who the characters ARE, not what the characters DO).  This is not an indictment by itself; some of the best works of fiction are essentially character studies (for example, Catcher in the Rye's Holden Caufield really doesn't do much, the book is about who he is and his conception of the world).  However, if you rely on characters as the tentpoles of your movie, those characters need to be compelling, to have something that makes the audience want to understand them better, to be empathic enough that the audience can relate to thoughts that they themsleves have thought or emotions that approximate what they have felt.  The characters here, as far as I can tell, offer nothing new or interesting.  At the beginning, George Clooney's character's philosophy of non-commitment seemed like it had something novel underneath the surface, but turned out that really it amounted to nothing more than what you can hear from any random freshman frat brother (\\"I ain't never getting married.  Kids, who needs them?\\")  The movie never really explores what is behind his philosophy or how it informs his life. I won't even go into the two lead women's characters; they really were studies in one dimensional caricatures.     (ii) The acting was servicable, but really not in the realm of Oscar-worthiness.  The main character's defining traits are isolated stoicism and detatched coolness.  Clooney does what he always does by playing himself.  I defy anyone to come up with any diferentiating traits between his characters in ER, Oceans 11/12/13, the Peacemaker, Out of Sight, Leatherheads, Intolerable Cruelty, etc.  (I'll give you Syriana and Oh Brother, Where Art Thou).  The point is again, as the movie relies primarily on making this character compelling, the bar is higher than just two hours of Clooney mugging for the camera. Anna Kindrick nomination was questionable, but ultimately justifiable (though I am not sure how hard it is to do uptight career girl). Vera Farmiga's nomination was sheer madness; I am guessing it had more to do with a certain New York Times Magazine article than anything else.    (iii) The movie just makes you feel bad and not in a good way.  I love sad movies and, when earned, will applaud any movie that makes you feel it emotionally.  However, I would put this in a category of manipulative movies which simply trigger external feelings by barfing it onto the screen.  Viewers already feel worried about losing their jobs in this environment and empathize with those who have lost their jobs.  Throwing a bunch of real folks on the screen to showcase the misery of the lowest point of their lives really is not the same as building an interesting and empathetic character or story to engage the audience on an internal level.      ******SPOILER******  (iv) I can't really say a lot about the plot as there really is not much there.  Man tries to get 10mm frequent flier miles, succeeds, finds that it's not as rewarding as he expected.  Along the way, he has a relationship with a married woman and tutors a new recruit, who comes to find the world ismore complicated than she expected.  That's pretty much it.  Again, this is not meant to be a plot driven movie.  ******END OF SPOILER******    Overall, am I glad I saw it?  No, not really.  It really did not give me anything that I have not seen before or anything to think about that has not been covered better in any number of other places.
B002C6A6N6|3.0|I still can't find anywhere that says that the complete series includes the two movies, which would normally would be a good thing but Amazon suggested I also buy the movies. So I ended up with two of each movie and in returning the extra one I had to pay half of the cost of the movie just to ship it back. Also the case for the set was damaged in more then one place. Never had a problem with Amazon before but I'm quite unhappy with this purchase.
B0033AX26I|4.0|Found the music sweet and nostalgic. This charming CD was a reminder of the historic episode in Mexican history. My husband is Irish and I am Mexican, so we found it particulaly poignant. There is a fusion of both Irish and Mexican music. It is perfect for us since we have visited the museum devoted to these heroes. It is outside of Mexico City in Churubusco.
B000HIVO64|5.0|The Information carries on Beck's musical ingenuity from the release of Guero. The funky sound album holds the listener captive with solid bass and imaginative lyrics. It holds tracks bringing stiff bass to soft trance-like melodies. Therefore, the Information is just another one of Beck's masterpieces that incorporates and warps imaginative sounds into a solid finish.    The album opens up with a lively piece, \\"Elevator Music,\\" which lays down a catchy bass line causing the listener to want to stand up and dance. This preparers the listener for what lies ahead because most the songs on this album are great tunes ready to be played for any occasion. The next song picks right up where \\"Elevator Music\\" left off, \\"Think I'm In Love.\\" This more smoothed out song still holds a strong and rhythmic bass line, but has a more chill feel to it. Especially when the song comes to the chorus, I always feel like singing along. This song also incorporates an assortment of orchestra instruments, such as the violin, in order to deliver a rich musical atmosphere. To continue the greatness of this album, \\"Cellphone's Dead\\" does not let one down. This rich piece that holds one of the sickest bass lines I have ever heard is probably one the best songs on the album. Beck voices his lyrics over the solid bass line in a smooth and swift fashion as if almost rapping, but better. The song is also dynamic, roughly 3 minutes into it, Beck warps the beat into a smooth jib and brings in sound samples of people whistling, clicking, and what not, that brings meaning to the words \\"I am the Sun\\" that initiated the alteration. Probably my favorite track on the album is \\"Soldier Jane,\\" due to its mellow, smooth, but yet lively beat. Every time I listen a trance befalls me and I just want to get in my car and drive across the country. The trance-like melody could almost be derived from John Chowning's FM synthesis in that it is so raw. Regardless, this song is badass along with its video in which Beckjust sits his head in front of the camera with swirling bright colors circling his face. Beck slows the album down a little with \\"Dark Star.\\" Here he gets into a mellow bass line while spitting soft rhymes. Once he hits the chorus, his voice distorts into an airy feel bringing on another trance to the listener. One of my favorite parts to this piece comes in around 3 minutes with the drums that progress the tempo to finish the song with a more lively bass line. By far the craziest and bizarre song on this album holds its own name, \\"The Information.\\" This dynamic piece has a solid funky beat with weird sounds mixed in everywhere, such as yawns from women. It gives a feel as if Beck was walking down the street utilizing everything he finds, such as trashcans and horns, to create a musical ensemble. The piece incorporates everything Beck stands for: funky alternative music. Beck did not disappoint with this album and I believe it is by far one of his greatest works.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I had to take the books out of my house, because the impulse to read them repeatedly was becoming a huge time suck. I love the first season, the best thing is, instead of making the characters less interesting through the television medium, the characters come to life as the story develops in a parallel time line. Compared to the books, which are all from Sookie's perspective and the reader discovers everything when she does. Extra bonus: I can do other stuff while I watch the DVDs.

B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie was shown to a group of Christian inmates at a State Run CDC camp locally.  It was so well received by this group that the whole camp desired to view it also.  Later, the staff of firefighters also wished to view this film do its popularity with the whole camp.  It is so great when a major film company goes out of its way to relate a moral film to the public.  This is not a just for Christians film, but all religions can see the greatness of this film.  In fact, society in general will agree after viewing this film that it displays the greatness of character of most of the roles presented in the film.  Outstanding film from Amazon.com.

0316154687|5.0|Much of this book is based on David's experiences in Tokyo.  Ironically, I bought this book to read on a flight TO Tokyo.  Fortunately, I did not start it until a couple of days into my trip.  That was a couple of days of being completely immersed and baffled by Japanese culture, gadgetry, mass transit, etc.  Don't get me wrong.  I absolutely love Tokyo and its gracious people.  But he really nailed so much of what I felt.  I nearly soiled myself several times from laughing so hard.  I have read it over and over and it just doesn't get old.  Thank you, David, for making me feel that even if I thought I was losing my mind, I was not alone!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I wanna diverge from my usual practice a little with this review and actually review an album that I'm not terribly familiar with, i.e., OK COMPUTER by Radiohead. One reason for this is that something I do know about this album is that it's highly acclaimed and one of the most-discussed albums of the 1990s. Therefore, I thought that I would like to briefly get my thoughts down after only 3 - 4 listens before I stumble upon someone else's review and learn why THEY think its such a great/lousy/whatever album. This is a rather long-winded way of saying that I want my thoughts here to be, as much as possible, my own.    First of all, autonomic reflexes don't lie. The first time I heard \\"Exit Music (For A Film)\\", I got goosebumps all up and down my arms - something that very rarely happens to me. It was at this point where I became fairly sure I was in the presence of greatness. Secondly, this album is a true grower - that is to say, the more I hear of it, the more I WANT to here of it, which, for me, almost never happens with music recorded in the last 10 - 15 years. Finally, one of the things I gleaned from what little I've read about this album is that it is often compaired to the work of such (truly classic) classic rock artists as the Beatles and Pink Floyd. I originally took this to mean that it was ripped off from them stylistically, but after a few listens realized that what was probably meant by such comparisons was that Radiohead have done here, like Floyd and the Fab Four at their best, is to craft a truly immersive listening experience.    Conclusion: Get your hands on a copy. I was not particularly predisposed to enjoy this album, and I am loving it.    PS Listen on headphones if you can. This album is mixed beautifully and it's hard to catch a lot of the little details and the brilliant stereo imaging if you're listening on speakers.
0312370849|5.0|What a wonderful book!  I am not a huge reader so I struggled with what to read on a recent vacation.  A friend gave it to me, raving about the book!  I read it in 3 days, which is VERY quick for me.  I couldn't put it down.  The first evening I had it, I only read the first 10 pages and was already hooked!      It is about an interesting, and sad, time in the world's history and the author does an incredible job of making the reader see the historical events in a fiction story.      I loved the way that the chapters flipped back and forth between stories without making the chapters too long, whereas to forget about what happened in each storyline.      I highly recommend this book to anyone.

B00000612P|5.0|I have this on vinyl- Im proud to say. Not only is it full of some of the best songs of all time but that album cover is one of the coolest. Very unique and if you have the vinyl you know what I mean. ;)<br /><br />This was real Rod. Bluesy, boozy?, ballsy Rod. The Rod Stewart we miss and adore. After his time in the Small Faces/Faces -which was some of the most mind blowin rock'n'roll ever!--he really grabbed audiences with his seemingly carefree, all-out, full-tilt, R&B based \\"solo\\" boogie rock. But of course he tugs at your heart strings with \\"Reason To Believe\\". I dearly miss this side of this man and his magical band of gypsy-like fellas in great garb and great form. ....and my Grandmother adores Rod! Hehe!<br /><br />Order this today. Youll love it. ....if you dont have it already.

B000ZMVAXO|5.0|I knew how big, or should I say 'small' this thing was.  I had stocked it at our facility.  I wanted something I could take into other rooms or to take with me when I travel.  I currently play through a Peavey 5150, and it's not very mobile.  When I got the Vox Metal Guitar Headphone Amp and plugged it in, I was amazed at how big the sound coming out of it was!  This thing really rips, and I don't turn the volume all the way up.  It's no match for the 5150, but if you are thinking about spending your hard earned money to buy this, you won't be disappointed.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Incredibly, I am just now listening to this album for the first time, almost two years after its release. I would love to place some reason for this on the subconscious effect of the number of negative reviews here, but that's lame. So far, this album reminds me of the second, yet it still manages to forge ahead into some kind of off-the-map territory, a dismal wasteland of colder soundscapes. I hear so much original music on here, not so many lifted samples from old scratchy recordings. So far, I love the first three tracks, nice blends of guitar and synth. Yeah, OK, now on track #5, and I am definitely wondering why so many fans do not love this album. \\"We Carry On\\" is some kind of tribute to the Silver Apples' \\"Oscillations\\", almost as obvious as the USA-inspired second album's \\"Half Day Closing\\". This track rocks. OK, that's enough for now. I am not finished listening, but I already know how many stars I plan to give it. Wow, this band keeps pushing the envelope, somewhere out there with Radiohead and Autechre as far as creative musical composition is concerned. OK, so I'm still here, just finishing 'Threads'. Fantastic album.

B002ZFQD04|4.0|She's 50! 50 years old! SHe can kick...she can...ok ok enough with the SNL Molly Shannon reference.    But seriously, at 50 Madonna is still givin it to you, and Sticky & Sweet is no exception to her repretoire of outrageous, high energy performances.    After seeing the show here in California, it wasn't my favorite, although I'll never walk away from a Madonna show unsatisfied. However, after watching this DVD I completely felt the same energy if not more than when I was at the show. The production and cinematography of this show also made me like several songs more than when I first saw the show, like Spanish Lesson and La Isla Bonita/Lela Pala Tuta. The Argentinian crowd is absolutely amazing and we get see Madonna really let loose and  get social with her audience, something she's been gradually getting better at since ReInvention Tour. She's absolutely bonkers in this show, impeccably delivering fantastic dance routines, and hooting and hollering hilariously throughout the show.    This DVD is a welcome change from the format of Confessions Tour which was a great DVD but it was so busy and difficult to actually see Madonna performing on the stage. Akerlund's production of CT was like a 2 hour music video which I though was overkill given that CT is quite possibly one of the best shows in her career. Sticky & Sweet gives much needed and deserved focus to Madonna while she's flying all over the stage.    Personal Highlights:  Candy Shop/Beat Goes On  Vogue  Into The Groove  Heartbeat  She's Not Me  Music  Get Stupid [Video Interlude]  Like A Prayer [awesome remix version]  Give It 2 Me    I could have done without Human Nature, Borderline, 4 Minutes, and Hung Up. The 'Rain/Here Comes The Rain Again' Video Interlude was terrible in my opinion. I was shocked that she was ok with that being in the show because artistically it was very weak [the animation sequence was very generic and somewhat silly]    Overall I was pleasantly surprised because, like I said before,it wasn't my favorite show but after seeing the DVD I feel that I like it a lot more than I thought.    The last plus: The Audio selection from the tour is really nice to have, espcially since several of the songs are reworked, new versions. I'm also sure I would add the bonus behind the scenes footage as I have heard it's a great docu featurette. I have yet to watch the extras.

0393072231|5.0|You could argue that The Big Short is about a lot of different things -- about finance, hubris, turn-of-the-century democratic capitalism, Wall Street culture, American culture. All of that is true. But I read it as, at heart, a story about the social, personal, and intellectual circumstances that can produce dazzling rightness or staggering wrongness.    For readers of Lewis's other work, that story might be familiar. In the prologue to The Big Short, Lewis positions it as a sequel to Liar's Poker, his account of his own stint on 1980s-era Wall Street. I suppose he would know best, but to me, this newest book seems, instead, to be the intellectual scion of Moneyball. That, too, was an astonishing story about rightness and wrongness: about the insight of outsiders and the intransigence of insiders; about the ability of those outsiders to recognize and exploit the inefficiencies of the insiders' ossified convictions; and about the social and intellectual forces that made it difficult for the insiders to grasp what was going on. Steve Eisman, Charlie Ledley, Greg Lippman, Michael Burry: these guys are to Wall Street what Bill James was to baseball.    The bottom line: If you're looking for an entertaining and informative read, then this is a book for you. The Big Short is as good as Moneyball, but it isn't as fun. And for that reason, I'm only giving it 4 stars - but it is still nevertheless a good read.
0810982862|1.0|First of all, the movie is pure eye candy.  Absolutely delicious.      I have a number of 'art of' books in my collection and enjoy them very much.  I bought this book with high expectations.  What I got was a thin book leaving me wanting way way way more than I got.  Most of the art is sub-par, (some of it is actually pixelated!)  and it feels as if the team putting this book together did it in there spare time over the course of a weekend.  Very poor quality and extremely disappointing.  I returned it.

B000002L9Y|5.0|After the false comeback of [[ASIN:B000002KXO Mirage]] it didn't take much to figure out what it was Fleetwood Mac were doing wrong. Basically they'd gotton stuck in a rut and it was starting to drag their sound down to a huge extent. Six years later the regrouped and,for better or worse on the personal situations of the band members they came out with this album that musically and commercially re-invented Fleetwood Mac as completely contemporary artists. In the years since their previous album there had been a lot of electronic overkill in a lot of genres of pop music and the result is a lot of criticism of the music strictly on that basis that I do and don't always agree with. Either way you look at it the appeal of this albums production is that the new elements introduced to the music such heavier electric keyboards,echoplexes and other studio effects work to enhance the basic sound this lineup of Fleetwood Mac always held to. Not only that but in comparasin to before the songs on this album are incredibly strong. There's no irony at all that this album was realeased on the 10'th year anniversary of their breaktrhough album [[ASIN:B000002KGT Rumours]] and in terms of content I have to say: if the two Fleetwood Mac studio albums released between that and this were never made this would've been an excellent follow up. Buckingham's strong \\"Big Love\\" opens the affair with a beat heavy dance-rocker that sets the tone for much of the rest of the album. The uptempo songs on this album borrow as much from funky dance/pop as it does the California pop/rock the band made famous. Those two find their way onto two of the albums best songs and happily it's biggest hits on Christie McVie's two showstoppers \\"Everywhere\\" and \\"Little Lies\\"-both moodily ridden pop classics with enough soul in them that ten years later Chaka Khan even covered the former of those songs on her[[ASIN:B00077831Y Epiphany: The Best of Chaka Khan, Vol. 1]]. Buckingham's \\"Caroline\\",\\"Family Man\\" and the upeat HEAVILY dance influenced \\"You And I,Part II\\" are his additions to that flavor in this album wheras his more experimental title song is somewhat memorable but it just a little too dark and minor chorded to fit 100% correctly. Perhaps because of her drug problems at this point Stevie Nicks' contributions here don't exactly find her at her best. Most of them are soft tunes such as \\"Seven Wonders\\",\\"When I See You Again\\" and the more uptempo \\"Welcome To The Room...Sara\\". They fit in with the album musically but Stevie's brittle and damaged voice on these songs won't be very appealing even for fans of her vulnerable vocal style. Even with that mild weakness this is the stronger of Fleetwood Mac's 80's albums and one of the musical highpoints of their career.Caroline\\",\\"Family Man\\" and the upeat HEAVILY dance influenced \\"You And I,Part II\\" are his additions to that flavor in this album wheras his more experimental title song is somewhat memorable but it just a little too dark and minor chorded to fit 100% correctly.

B001R0KH3M|5.0|Over the years there have been precious few DVD's of any sort on the subject of Stevie Wonder,one of my favorite all time musicians. Even though this come somewhat late in his career this live presentation is certainly a treat. Sure a lot of us can nitpick that there's no DVD available of any of the concerts from the peak of his career but he makes this particular one a very all encompassing event. You'd expect Stevie,at this point in his career that he'd turn his concerts into big hit parades packed with nothing but songs everyone would know. Luckily Stevie Wonder also has gained fame as an album artist and,throughout his career much as with The Beatles many of his best known songs often didn't become hits. That is how Stevie presents himself here-as an almost unspeakably talented musician,singer and songwriter with a lot more to say to the people than what they might here on the radio. One big feature of this is that Stevie plays a handfull of songs from his often neglected 1980 album [[ASIN:B00004SZWB Hotter Than July]]. He even starts everything off with a song from that album in a stomping version of \\"As If You Read My Mind\\".From the same album he also performs \\"Did I Hear You Say You Love Me\\",\\"All I Do\\",\\"Lately\\" and \\"Master Blaster\\". Many of these songs might no be too familiar to Wonder fans but anyone who experiences this will feel as if they've been intimately involved with these songs forever. He really does make the Beatle connection with a \\"uk medley\\" mostly comprised of potent versions of Beatle songs. He's even joined by his grown daughter Aisha on the previously unheard \\"I'm Gonna Laugh You Right Out Of My Life\\". In between many of these songs Stevie talks with the audience about keeping their inner eyes open to the joys and sorrows of the world and what can be done to improve upon some of the situations. Especially notable on this area is his intro to \\"Visions\\". Mindfull of blending old and new Stevie presents his 1972 funk classic \\"Superstition\\" with his recent hit \\"So What The Fuss\\" from his 2005 album [[ASIN:B0001MSGX0 A Time To Love]]. It's amazing how with all the years seperating the songs how they fit so well together as if his career has come through another full circle and trust me;he's had many. Also notable is his version here of the Thom Bell written classic \\"People Make The World Go 'Round\\",an eerily beautiful song to begin with that is entirely keeping with Stevie's social vision for the people of the world. Seeing and hearing this man do his thing not only makes you feel like part of the audience itself but realize how his music and strong character can make you happy and think all at the same time. Not only will you come out of this having enjoyed an incredible live musical experience but also feel like a much better person for having experienced all of it.c \\"Superstition\\" with his recent hit \\"So What The Fuss\\" from his 2005 album [[ASIN:B0001MSGX0 A Time To Love]].

B000002KXO|4.0|The mid/late 70's had been such as a mad rush for Fleewood Mac as they endured almost uncalculable success with their[[ASIN:B000002KGT Rumours]] album and than two years later saw it somewhat abruptly fall apart with the sprawling,creatively ambitious follow up [[ASIN:B00009RAJJ Tusk]]. After all this whirlwind it was only natural for members of the band,especially Stevie and Lindsey began to pursue solo careers as the decade began. You would think with this odd in between album sandwiching those solo projects and the bands real 80's comeback [[ASIN:B000002L9Y Tango in the Night]] that this album would be totally forgotton and sometimes it is. It wasn't until about a decade or so ago that I even became aware they recorded this album. As for what it is I can only say this. If your a Fleetwood Mac fan coming across this album thinking your getting some modernized,forgotton 80's comeback attempt your in for a huge shock. Between their 70's work together and solo output all the members of the band were very creatively exhausted by this point (who would'nt be with their excellent previous output) and decided to put out this very low key album as sort of a prelude to a total reinvention. Why is this low key? Well for one this album doesn't exactly go for broke when it comes to production,presented a very unadorned sound overall with very few frills. Not only that but while all of the songs sound very good and many are quite memorable the band aren't gaining any new ground musically here;electing to play it safe by maintaining their strenghs as opposed to improving on them. The majority of the album follows that patter closely. It's very much rooted in Fleedwood Mac's basic mid/late 70's sound but with no frills. Some might view this as meaning the album finds them going through the motions yet there are some songs that look to a different quality. Lindsey's \\"Book Of Love\\",\\"Empire State\\" and \\"Oh Diane\\" have this sleek soulful rock flavor similar but also a mild extention of his solo work only with a ful band emphasis and Christine McVie's smokey ballad \\"Only Over You\\" does point to something close to a somewhat early 80's production. That can also be said of Nicks' \\"Gypsey\\" which is quite possible the strongest overall tune on this album. It would'nt be for another six years that Fleetwood Mac would release another album and when they did the times were definately acknowledged-if nothing else because by later in the decade a bare sound like this for a pop band of any kind wasn't anywhere close to commercially viable. It's a good enough album generally,especially in terms of songwriting but all the same it's lacking a certain production gloss and sleekness that tended to define the Buckingham/Nicks era group.but also a mild extention of his solo work only with a ful band emphasis and Christine McVie's smokey ballad \\"Only Over You\\" does point to something close to a somewhat early 80's production.

Otherwise the characters are great and provide lots of entertainment.
B00000ITOY|4.0|my son loves shapes so i thought he would love this. he doesn't play with it as much as i thought but he is very obsessed with cars, so i understand.  this is a cute little toy, bright colors and sturdy.  he loves trying to get the shapes on the right skewers and with these shapes i was able to teach him his colors!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|David Attenborough's narration and the unobtrusive score for Planet Earth are the perfect accompaniments to the astounding footage this collection showcases. Filled with illuminating science, television firsts, tense and touching moments, it's a fantastic way to spend a few hours of your life. Watch it on the highest definition, largest screen you can. Better than most (probably all) Hollywood Blockbusters.
0743454537|5.0|Wonderful writing, unexpected plot twists, sympathetic and emotionally complex characters, and a heart-wrenching issue combine to create the best novel I have read, maybe ever!
0810983915|5.0|This book is a great gift for kids. My 9 yo loves this whole series and reads it every night before bed.
0805091742|5.0|A book can have a life-changing impact on a person's life.  Several people said that to me regarding my books.  I have certainly come in contact with books by others that have changed the trajectory of my life.  I still have a book on my shelf during the reading of which I first got an idea to escape the USSR and come to America.  I mean, I was ready for the idea, but the book provided that final straw that brought the structure together.<br /><br />There have been business books that had a trajectory-changing impact on me.  The latest of such volumes is The Checklist Manifesto by Dr. Atul Gawande.<br /><br />Gawande - a surgeon and a terrific writer - tracks the development of formal checklists to the 1930s aviation and the arrival of multi-engine planes: \\"Flying this new plane was too complicated to be left to the memory of one person.\\"  He continues \\"Faulty memory and distraction are a particular danger in what engineers call all-or-none processes: if you miss just one key thing, you might as well not have made the effort at all.  Checklists ... provide protection against such failures.  They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit.\\"<br /><br />As I read, I saw striking parallels with trading.  \\"Checklists seem able to defend anyone, even the experienced, against failure in many more tasks than we realized.  They provide a kind of a cognitive net.  They catch flaws of memory, attention, and thoroughness... They do not try to spell out everything.  A checklist cannot fly a plane.  Instead they provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps.\\"<br /><br />Gawande interviews pilots, construction managers, physicians, and financiers in his checklist quest.  He shares his own surgical checklist odyssey and provides do's and don'ts  for those who would create a checklist.  Reading this book I knew I would be designing `Elder safe trading checklist.'
B0035V35P8|5.0|OK so I loved this movie. It is over the top and predictable... so what?!  It is very, very gory. Definitely not for the squeamish.  It reminds me of the graphic novel movies that have come out in recent years.  Don't overthink it, just watch and enjoy.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side (especially being a true story in the recent past) shows all of us that we are but ONE human race and everyone has something to give.  I never looked at my watch as the movie had no dull spots.  Every scene had a purpose and added to the movie.  Great writing, great acting, great directing...and wonderful pictures of the real Michael Oher, Miss Sue and the Toughy family.  This is one of the movies that you will watch over and over again.
B002ZG983M|5.0|Kick Ass is how should I say.... awesome, hilarious, cool, high octane energy, kinetic, B*lls to the wall violent, edgy. Have not seen a movie this outlandish since Wanted (which Mark Millar also wrote the graphic novel) and Shoot 'Em Up, both spectacular.<br />Director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) gives us a movie that is unique in its own right, takes the mythos of comic book heroes and gives it a 360 twist, and creates a memorable movie.<br />This movie will dazzle you, don't get me wrong it is violent, then again it's based on a graphic novel so it's suppose to be! Vaughn has gathered a great group of actors, veteran and new alike to tell a story of a teenager named Dave (new comer Aaron Johnson) who is tired of just sitting on the sidelines of life, tired of the injustice he sees around him, people being victimized and no one does nothing, so he goes out to create his alter ego, Kick Ass! Johnson plays Dave as a geeky, shy, bored, horny teenager, how we were in high school, what keeps it so real, he plays the uber geek to perfection, when it is so well done by the likes of Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg, Aaron Johnson takes it to another level creating something primo, where we as a viewer root for this guy! And Kick Ass doesn't screw around, he gets right into it--- shall I say the proverbial \\"popping that first Vigilante cherry\\", early on tries to stop some thugs who are stealing a car and ends up getting his ass handed to him, almost getting killed, much like what would happen in real life... yet this does not deter his quest and his next foray into fighting turns out better and his alter ego Kick Ass becomes famous setting off a chain of events that he could not even fathom would happen. Even when meeting Hit Girl and Big Daddy for the first time who save his butt, he then realizes that they are the real deal, fighting crime, kicking ass and taking names, and that the up close violence for him is just too much and it's not like the movies portray it to be, where he's just a kid, having pipe dreams of doing something extraordinary out of the ordinary. In the end though, doing the right thing even it means your life is the right thing to do.<br /><br />Special Kudos goes to Mark Strong (plays Frank D'Amico), this actor I am liking more and more ever since seeing him in Body of Lies and RocknRolla, and Sherlock Holmes, watch out for him in the new Robin Hood this summer with Russell Crowe! he plays the bad guy with such humor and yet also grounded as if he could be a real guy in real life, he is a drug king pin using a Lumber Co. as a front for his operations, a wonderful performance in deed, delivers great dead pan humor.<br />Then there is Hit Girl/ Mindy MacCready (new comer Chloe Moretz), a 11 year old who can wield a knife, gun, grenades, swords with the best, and curses like a sailor, what makes it even that more funny! She is certainly a scene stealer in this movie, great job by this young talented actress. And there is Big Daddy/ Damon MacCready (played by my man Nic Cage, I forgive you Cage for giving us crap like Knowing, Next, Bangkok Dangerous, and Ghost Rider) Nic Cage gives such a nuanced performance, teaching his young daughter the art of shoot, kill, maim, and when he is in costume changing his voice (taking a page out of Adam West when he donned the bat suit), He did a great job with his role, his back story is he has some unfinished business with D'Amico, check out his off kilter, brilliant performance in Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans, awesome movie. Christopher Mintz Plasse (Red Mist/ Chris D'Amico) we all know him as McLovin--- shedding that persona giving us a more complex, more than meets the eye type character who just wants the attention of his father and show he can hang and be tough and wants so desperately to show he can take over his pop's business, and all too eager to help his dad get rid of Kick Ass.<br /><br />I am happy Vaughn and Co. made a hard R movie, not shying away from the violence, even though it shows young people in peril, no compromises, staying true to its comic book roots and being loyal. And almost lampooning Spiderman, Superman, XMen, Watchmen and yet ultimately honoring said comics. A nice homage to Watchmen which is the blue print for Vigilante Heroes which owes it's roots to the Batman mythology. The director takes what we always wanted to be; who hasn't said in their youth, \\"Damn wish I could be Batman, Superman, Wolverine, Iron Man\\". Where Vaughn took the tried and true comic books and movies incorporates everything we love but keeps it so real and tangible.<br /><br />A couple of great scenes stand out for me, one is D'Amico and his goons have captured Big Daddy and Kick Ass, they are being tortured, not a pleasant scene, pretty brutal... but what follows, the action sequence is just utterly mind blowing, a First Person Shooter scene was just so visually eye popping made Doom's FPS look childish!<br />And the last 25 mins or so, the assault on D'Amico's high rise condo was dead on cool. And the soundtrack was amazing, using a Ennio Morricone type Spaghetti Western Style music was freakin' Frosty! The whole soundtrack just was in sync with the movie.<br /><br />Kick Ass is a no holds barred movie that leaves you satisfied, where after viewing you just wanna grab a smoke and think about what you just witnessed, I cannot wait for the sequel, and this most definitely will be added to my Blu Ray collection.shows young people in peril, no compromises, staying true to its comic book roots and being loyal.

B00006JSS8|5.0|I can count on Amazon to have what I need when the item is hard to locate else where.
B002ZFQD04|2.0|Being a Madonna fan for over 20 years, the enchantment is really wearing off.  First came \\"Hard Candy\\", not only her worst album, but one of the worst albums EVER!!!  I had went ahead and bought tickets to the show even though I know that her concerts usually consist promoting her latest album.  Once I checked the tracklisting of the show and watched some snippets on youtube, I said \\"Nope!\\".  I sold my tix (and made a $500 profit using stubhub, which she endorsed by the way).    I waited until the professionally shot concert was available to download and then watched it.  I had to constantly shake my head in disappointment and fast forward through tracks.  #1 - OVERPRODUCED.  I know she didn't lip-synch all of her songs, but this release makes it seem like she did (cause I've heard her really sing \\"Human Nature\\" live from youtube and...OH MY...IT IS AWFUL!)  #2 - Lame opening.  After being WOWED from tour openings such as Confessions, Reinvention, and Blond Ambition, this was just really a let down and pretty boring.  #3 - Overcursing.  Is the \\"F\\" word really necessary ALL OF THE TIME.  I lost count.  It sounds really forced and that she is trying to hard be too cool.  #4 - Oversexing.  Okay.  Yes.  She is 51 and is in great shape and could put most of young competition to shame, but I don't need to see it, mostly because I already have from 1983-1994.  She is basically naked through half of the show.  She is trying too hard to prove she's not old by gyrating on the floor and making orgasmic sounds while saying \\"See my booty get down\\" and saying things like \\"My sugar is raw\\" [rolls eyes] Seriously Madonna?...Seriously?    The only redeeming tracks from this concert are the renditions of Borderline (even though she curses during it) and Like A Prayer.  Some other tracks are bearable such as Into the Groove and You Must Love Me/DCFMA.  I will credit her for giving a full 2 hour concert as well.  They are usually 1 hour 30-40 min.    The behind the scenes documentary is actually really good and makes you want to actually see the concert, especially if you haven't seen it (I suggest watching this first).  I found it to be less self-righteous than \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\" and wish that documentary was more like this release.    As far as this release goes.  I think it is a worthwhile package for the FANS.  If you are not a fan or just a casual fan, DO NOT BUY THIS!  You will be extremely disappointed (The hits are all remixed and unrecognizable).  I am a fan and am really disappointed, so that should tell you something.    I hope she has gotten this crap out of her system and is ready to go back to giving us something good.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is an adorable movie, my daughter just LOVES it:) I would suggest every little girl and boy see this movie what an amazing story line!!!!
1416594787|4.0|The espoused purpose of \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" by Richard Dawkins is to provide the evidence for evolution.  It is the first book I've read by Dawkins, and based upon my preconceptions of the author, I expected a crisp, surgical, objective, fact-filled presentation.  It didn't quite measure up to my expectations, but it was an interesting and enlightening read nonetheless.  Dawkins' evidence for the veracity of evolution is compelling for someone who already believes or who is open minded and accepting of scientific proof.  The book is replete with asides and digressions which are quite entertaining even though they detracted somewhat from the case for evolution.  On the flip side, his coverage of irreducible complexity and living fossils are brief and unsatisfactory.  Plus, his purpose would have been better served if had just presented the facts and resisted the temptation to attack the opposition - \\"History Deniers\\" as he euphemistically calls them.
B0012GMVG2|4.0|Released: April 1982  Produced by: Toto  Mega international pop success picks up where debut left off, minus prog-rock leanings. Result is more focused, classic pop-rock R&B fusion resulting in six Grammy's. Set actually extremely effective today, unlike many Grammy hogs. Sophisticated compositions and arrangements of David Paich expertly rendered by absolute knock out groove-machine rhythm section of Jeff Porcaro and David Hungate, never more in evidence (or better) than here. Marred only by occasional straddle into MOR (\\"It's A Feeling,\\" \\"Good For You\\"), many merits dwarf few faults.  Contains smash hits \\"Rosanna\\" (Billboard #2) and Toto's only #1 single, \\"Africa.\\" Notable for emergence of Steve Lukather as vocalist (\\"Rosanna\\"), and songwriter (Billboard #10 \\"I Won't Hold You Back,\\" \\"Afraid Of Love\\"). Packed with standouts including rock cuts \\"We Made It,\\" \\"Lovers In The Night\\" and top 40 \\"Make Believe.\\" Lush orchestral arrangements by James Newton-Howard and Marty Paich.  Seminal 80's album. Essential.

B0000257U0|2.0|Released: May 1995  Produced by: Toto  Were 1/2 stars available, this would rate a 2-1/2. Choppy, overlong and ballad-laden follow-up to Kingdom Of Desire, once again released on an indy label in US. Notable for accomplished Simon Philips' studio debut as drummer. After promising opener \\"Gift of Faith\\" (press \\"next\\" at 5:30 to avoid one of the most repetitive pointless outtros ever), kind of lulls listener with mid-tempo tracks that range from good (\\"I Will Remember,\\" \\"Slipped Away\\") to simply not bad (\\"You Belong To Me,\\" \\"The Turning Point\\")--until you realize you're half asleep by track 8. David Paich lead vocal meter: 1/2 song. Highlights: groovy \\"Time Is The Enemy,\\" shredding \\"Drag Him To The Roof,\\" infectious ballad \\"The Road Goes On,\\" and jazz-fusion ripper \\"Dave's Gone Skiing\\" (whew!). Can be programmed into a much more effective album simply by avoiding about 5 songs. Additional vocals by Jenny Douglas-McRae and John James, who toured with band to curtail loss of Kimball and Williams vocal range. Aficionados only.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|One of the reviewers referred to this disconnected, back-and-forth crap as 'LeCarre, American Style'. I've seen some of LeCarre's work on screen, such as \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" and \\"Smiley's People\\", both of which are in a class by themselves. Another reviewer recommended \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\". Excellent film, although I have not seen it in years. I was sorely disappointed with this film. As one reviewer remarked, 'too dark'. I agree. The film strings together some of the history associated with the CIA/OSS. Damon's character appears to be loosely based on James Jesus Angleton, head of CI for 20 years. The back and forth nature of the film from WWII to 1961, then to post WWII, then to 1961, etc does nothing to enhance the film. For any viewer who hasn't read anything on the CIA or the cold war, I think it would be difficult to follow. I think the most preposterous thing in this film involves Wilson's (Damon) son and his link to the debacle at the Bay of Pigs. Implausible and positively farcical! Don't waste your time.     PS. My apologies to LeCarre, I couldn't find the accent key.
B000025OG6|4.0|Released: May 1993  Produced by: Toto  After burning through three lead vocalists--culminating with Jean-Michael Byron debacle in 1990--Toto hired from within, as Steve Lukather assumed task. Released several months after Jeff Porcaro's death--on independent label in the US--seemed to have deck stacked against it from start. However, where Turn Back and Isolation stumbled, KOD is blisteringly successful at what it does--rock hard. From opening thunder of \\"Gypsy Train,\\" it's apparent Lukather (and his guitar) are now front and center. Result is sure-handed hard rock album that practically nobody liked. Too bad, because with exception of trite \\"Kick Down The Walls,\\" it's as consistent as bands' best. Those who tuck-tail from balls-out crunch of \\"Don't Chain My Heart,\\" \\"How Many Times,\\" or bowel-shaking title track and ass-tearing funk of \\"She Knows The Devil,\\" overlooked fine ballads \\"2 Hearts\\" and \\"The Other Side\\" (latter cries for a David Paich lead vocal, but those inexplicably MIA here). All four singles failed to chart in US or UK. Chick Corea Elektric Band meets its match on instrumental monster \\"Jake To The Bone.\\" Lukather proves a fine vocalist (and extremely unappreciated). Uncanny yet subtle chops and laid back grooves of late Porcaro sadly on display for last time here. Not for everyone (but highly recommended).
1881273628|5.0|This book changed my life. Everyone should read this book regardless if married or single. Everyone should know what makes them feel loved. This book will help you determine exactly what it is that actually fills your heart. Great READ!!!
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Never mind the stereotypical characters, the hack's nightmare of a plot, or the surprise twist of an ending that is no surprise at all. Exactly how many times can an audience watch the same group of people escape certain death by a centimeter, in a cumbersome vehicle that is famous for slow acceleration and lousy steering, before we:   1)stop worrying about the characters' fate.    2)start wishing they will die, just for a change of pace.   3)actually yawn at the death of all mankind.  Roland Emmerich must have really wanted to know, because he spent 300 million dollars and 3 hours to find the answer.
0307454541|3.0|The story is pretty good, but the translation is just plain weird sometimes and full of tired cliches.<br />I won't be reading \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire.\\"
0452295548|5.0|The book is one of the most interesting I've ever read (and I've read a LOT of books). The information ,though some of it is very technical, was explained in terms easily understood by non-medical individuals. Having done some study on right brain/left brain issues, I learned new insights from Dr. Taylor's book. She also uses words beautifully.    Read it! You'll like it!    Deane Langdon
1582701709|5.0|So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I bought this book. People had told me to read it several different times and I didn't take any of them up on it. Then finally it took my boyfriend's fascination with the book for me to finally decide to buy myself a copy. It's truly an amazing read. It gets you thinking in ways you never though before. It's a great book for someone who is ready to turn there life around and doesn't want to live a life of hardships anymore. Some of it seems like commonsense but once you read the whole book you'll see how things start to happen in your favor. Truly a great book to read. It has started to change my life since the day I started reading it.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|In the time it took them to ship this to me, the price dropped nearly four dollars.  Now I see it has dropped yet again, to almost 10 dollars cheaper than what I paid for it.  Overall, the pad is great.  I use it for WoW and love the buttons and capabilities it gives me.  Really well constructed and the LED is a nice feature.  Realistically, nobody is going to use the LED in WoW, it is just eye candy, but at least it's nice eye candy.  The buttons are easy to program and use.  I love the thumb joystick for tanking.  Really lets me take my focus away from using the mouse so much and allow me to kite the mobs as I tank much easier.  Again, my three stars is basically cause the price keeps dropping.
0786868724|5.0|I just loved this book.  Like his other books, it was easy to read.  The characters for the most part were multidimensional and I felt a connection to each of them.  I hated for the book to end.  I could have finished in one day easily because it was that easy to read.  I stretched it out so that I could really enjoy and savor the messages.  Reminded me alot of Tuesdays with Morrie (another favorite)
B002VPE1B6|4.0|This is in the correct aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  This movie was filmed in digital 3d and was only streched to 2.35:1 for conventional cinemas.  If you saw this movie in an Imax theater then it was in the correct aspect ratio.
0307269752|5.0|This Compelling Fiction involving caustic family secrets, grisly serial killings, horrendous business miss-dealings on a grand scale and much more provide a complex plot.<br /><br />Journalist Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative business journalist and co-owner of a magazine called, \\"Millennium\\", has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom after a nasty libel suit from an executive named Wennerstr&ouml;m. His magazine lost its credibility and is on the road to lose everything.<br />Eventually he makes a breakthrough and needs a good researcher, where Lisbeth Salander, a severe, petite, anorexic-looking, punk-dressing, tattooed genius investigator appears on the scene. Blomqvist's perceptiveness takes hold and Salander's edgy brilliance shines. He spots talents that Salander has kept secret all her life.  As Salander lets some of her defenses down, a partnership develops that allows intense deduction and intuition, working up to a nail-biting conclusion that initiates a new set of problems to be faced in the second book, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\".<br />I found myself holding my breath a lot throughout this book! Whew! I recommend highly if you like to sit on the edge of your seat while you read! Great writing style, engaging plot, many complex layers, many unexpected twists, fascinating, NOT BORING characters, and much more!<br /><br />Also loved  THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, VERY VALENTINE, EXPLOSION IN PARIS, Lucia, Lucia...(BOOK CLUB)
B002XMGGJM|3.0|I ordered new yet I was sent used.  The picture online was shown of the US version however I received the Canadian Version(Which is fine because it is in both English in French).  No digital copy sleeve, no inserts, which points to it being an obviously used copy.  Slow shipping, and when asked why I was sent a used copy there was never a response.  Again, great item, poor vendor.
0753826852|5.0|I have passed this book on to countless people who all thank me.  The storyline will keep you reading long into the night.  Great characters in post-war Barcelona.  Highly recommend. Do yourself a favor and read it now.

0439023491|4.0|In some ways, I enjoyed Catching Fire more than The Hunger Games.  One review I read of the book (not on Amazon) said it seemed that Collins \\"phoned in\\" the second book just to kill time until the last book in the series.  I disagree with that assessment.  Sure, there wasn't as much fast-paced action.  But the spark is set to the fuse on the political powderkeg, and I liked following the development of that angle.  I appreciate the behind-the-scenes plotting, and I'm anxious to have some aspects of the plan explained in the final book.<br /><br />The personal powderkeg is also smoldering.  Katniss has relationships to patch up - with her mother, with Gale, with Peeta.  She's a little clumsy at times, and I'm wondering how she will manage to keep damage to a minimum.<br /><br />My son (age 14) said he liked the arena action in the first book better, but there was an intellectual angle to this arena that appealed to me.  I have to admit, I thought Peeta's character was a little cardboard at times (how can anyone be THAT perfect ALL the time???), but other times I thought I could really understand his motivation and that it rang true.<br /><br />My main complaint is that I should have waited until I already had the third book in hand before starting the series!
6304907648|4.0|If you enjoy infamous serial killer nostalgia and a great psychological thriller than this movie is a definite for you.  Sigourney Weaver and the copycat killer himself along with the interwoven drama of the detectives investigating his killing's all come together to make an intriguing thriller of a movie.    The only reason I didn't give it a full 5-star status is for the lack of in-depth screen time of showing the killing's as they're happening.  Great movie nontheless!
0439023483|4.0|A few pages into The Hunger Games, I very nearly took it back to the bookshelf.  The world described in those pages was so dreary, so hopeless.  The idea of a society that was powerless to keep their government from stealing two children to be human sacrifices was so repulsive, I just didn't want to read any further.<br /><br />However, I have a three-chapter rule, so I perservered.  And suddenly, I was caught up in this book.  It's been a while since I neglected work and home duties to read, but I finished this book and its sequel in three days. It's still sort of a love-hate relationship. I enjoyed the action and suspense but hated the cruelty; I admired Katniss' dogged determination to survive but wanted to kick her in the tail at times; I loved Peeta but found him to be a little too \\"slick\\" at times.<br /><br />I like books that leave me with things to think about once I close the cover, and this one certainly does.  Is Collins making a critique of our entertainment-obsessed culture? Is she presenting a model female protagonist or a flawed one?  What does it mean to love someone?  Will Katniss eventually choose Peeta or Gale? (I didn't say all my questions were lofty and philosophical!)
B0037W68F4|5.0|Top to bottom I adore the album and with out a doubt this is an album, not just a group a songs. Wish the vinyl version had been gatefold with tons of pictures and what not.

B0000C7PQK|4.0|The electronic music project, Enigma, which combines both ambient and dance is the brainchild of Michael Cretu. Although the group has been around since 1990, I first stumbled upon the group after their 2003 release, \\"Voyager,\\" only afterward hearing the group's earlier musical works. I'm almost glad that I discover the band in reverse order so as to avoid forming pre-conceptions about how \\"Voyager\\" should sound to be consistent with the rest of Engima's albums.    Despite many fans' hesitations with \\"Voyager,\\" I appreciate the varied textures and layering used throughout the album. All of the songs on the album except for \\"Incognito\\" begin with a mellow ambient texture and progress to a rhythmical driving beat. Enigma favors heavily processed vocal elements in all of their tracks. The group uses these voice elements uniquely in that for some tracks the vocal elements provide the mellow backing to surprisingly intense looped drum beats, while in other songs, voice takes the melody.    For the first track, \\"East to West,\\" a rich choir lulls the listener into a temporary place of relaxation before introducing a forceful looped drum beat which continues and intensifies throughout the piece. The song is tied together well by the graceful synth-choir background continuing throughout.    Similarly, \\"Page of Cups\\" begins using a complex texture, which incorporates samples that sound like children's laughter or seagulls, rhythmic electric keys, and a gentle soundscape of soft voice. Approaching the minute mark, the keyboard morphs into a plain but dominant drum beat. Although this piece features a variety of other samples, the structured backing voice and drumbeat root this song and illustrate the characteristic sound of many of Enigma's tracks.    In contrast, \\"Total Eclipse of the Moon\\" lets an electric string track start the song and continue throughout to provide continuity and harmony. A breathy male voice that features substantial echo and chorus effects takes the melody after the initial lead-in. The vocals relate to a song of love and separation, which the male voice equates to the eclipse of the moon. I find the song quite compelling and has a simple beauty not found in any of the other songs on \\"Voyager.\\"    Finally, \\"Incognito\\" stands out on \\"Voyager\\" as the album's most unique piece and truly speaks to the project's innovation and creativity. The song starts strong and finishes gracefully. It's almost as if \\"Incognito\\" is simply the typical theme of an Enigma song in reverse order. This piece, more than any other, is memorable from the very beginning as the deep male voice begins to chant, \\"Om walka om weh ohwa chicka ah oh om walka ah ow oww.\\" The chant supplies a great beat and focus for the entire song.    \\"Incognito\\" features an impressive number of fundamental techniques used in electronic music today. The chant on a loop, which traditionally would have been produced by looping tape, dating back to Musique Concrète of the 1940s, represents some of the earliest uses of looping. The piece pays tribute to the Theremin, one of the earliest electronic instruments, with a sample at 1:40. Finally, the track relies heavily on the popular drum machine to provide complementary rhythm to the piece. All in all, \\"Incognito\\" does a great job of illustrating the musical genius that is Michael Cretu and cunningly slips in a miniature introduction to electronic music simultaneously.    Although I do not speak with the experience of a devoted fan, \\"Voyager\\" is a fantastic standalone album and would be enjoyable for anyone echo appreciates well mixed ambient electronic music with a grounding beat. While \\"Voyager\\" would be hard-pressed to remain the single focus of a listener for long durations of time, the album serves as excellent background music that will have you unconsciously nodding along with the beat. In conclusion, I would recommend \\"Voyager\\" to first time listeners and Enigma fans alike; there's something for everyone on thisdiverse and well-structured album.

B001TW69J4|5.0|I just started learning how to play guitar.  My best friend is my teacher.  He's been playing for years now.  He introduced me to AAL last week.  This album has been on constant rotation on my iPod.  I can't believe that this music was created on an 8-string guitar.  Most bands that play 8-strings are usually really heavy bands like Meshuggah or Fear Factory.  Tosin plays this instrument on a completely different level.  His skill rivals Joe Satriani and Steve Vai for just plain technical genius.<br /><br />Get this album asap and behold the magic that is AAL.
0684833395|4.0|When I first started to read Catch 22 I had some trouble comprehending what it was saying. In the beginning there is a lot of very random detail and the story tends to jump around a lot. But after a while the story gets quite interesting and starts of with a lot of sarcasm and humor and towards the end moves to a more sad but much more realistic outcome. The story focuses on Yossarian and how he tries to get past Catch 22 to be able to go home and out of the military. But one of the things that the book does very well is that it thoroughly examines many other characters of dramatically different character types to contrast the different kinds of soldiers in WW2. The book tells of Yossarian's struggle and how ironically he ends up fighting the American military system instead of fighting the Germans, he doesn't care about the Germans as long as he stays alive. Over all this book is a very good interesting book that shows how Catch 22 actually applies to many situations in everyday life. Even though the information is a little hard to comprehend at first it is a very good book and I highly recommend it.
B0000VCZKW|2.0|The ugly parents are awful. OK, we've seen that before (think Harry Potter and the Dursleys).    The ugly principal is beyond evil - and scary to witness.    The pretty teacher is sweet and kind, but - well - ineffective and helpless. Poor kids.    The teacher tells Matilda a tale of her childhood (TOO MUCH INFORMATION) wherein her mom dies and then her father commits suicide, leaving her an orphan in the care of the evil Aunty Trunchbull. This is where I clicked the movie off and told my 6yr old we're getting rid of this film. \\"What did he do mama? He killed himself?\\" Thank you SO much, Danny DeVito, for introducing suicide to the kindergarten set.    Finally, Matilda tells her sweet-but-helpless teacher to \\"adopt me, Miss Honey!\\" And voila! just like that, papers are stapled together, parents quickly affix their signatures, and Matilda goes skipping off with her new mother. It takes more than that to adopt a DOG.
B0007G89G4|5.0|One of the best (if not the best) coming of age movies of all time. This movie has it all. It has murder mystery. It has misunderstood young men. It has hoodlums. It has flashbacks. And it has cussing cause it's cool. Although none of these actors, with the exception of Kiefer Sutherland, went on to make very major careers, maybe in River Phoenix's case because of his suicide, they all gave very convincing performances. The story was phenomenally captivating.From the start you won't want to stop, it is so much fun. It is a very serious movie, but at the same time it has a lot of well placed humor. All the characters have very distinctive and very likable personalities. The only thing I didn't like was the end where they told us what became of the boys as adults, and said the \\"bad boy\\" was going to turn his life around but was stabbed. Stephen King seems to like to kill kids (another example of this is \\"The Mist\\" where the father is forced to shoot his own son). This movie is a timeless classic. I will cherish it forever, and will definitely show this to my children. 50/10!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|One could debate the finer points of Holmesian lore till we're all blue in the face, so I will dispense with the issue entirely.<br /><br />This is a fine, entertaining action film.  The pacing is brisk, the dialogue wastes few words.  It's all very scenic and gloomy and rainy, and, I suppose, Londonish, though how much is CGI, and how well it reflects the historical London I do not venture to say.<br /><br />Downey provides us with an interesting interpretation of Holmes, which is full of eccentricity, though somewhat shadowed by seeming the slightest bit adolescent.  It's a bit disconcerting, too, to see Watson portrayed by an actor who is in reality several years younger than the man playing Holmes, but only because I am so used to Watson seeming the elder.<br /><br />The main pitfall of the film, of course, is that people are occasionally beaten over the head, when they are not being shot, or jumping out of second story windows, or diving from even higher elevations into the Thames, and they inevitably pop up fit as a fiddle, with nary a drop of blood to intrude on the fantasy.<br /><br />Well, alright, there is one scene with a catastrophic tone, which results in one of the main players at least \\"appearing\\" moderately injured, but the effect is transitory and our \\"worst fears\\" are quickly proved unnecessary.<br /><br />If you consider Jeremy Brett to have done more to bring Holmes to life than Conan Doyle himself, as do I, then you may see in this film not a challenger to the throne, but rather a different animal altogether, and one you may well enjoy for the newish perspective it offers.
0385504225|2.0|Having read two previous Dan Brown (hereafter referred to as DB) books -'Angels and Demons', and 'The Da Vinci Code', I approached 'The Lost Symbol' with some curiosity.  It had been six years since 'The Da Vinci Code' -lots of time for an author like Brown to pen an exciting book packed with fascinating facts, while improving on his writing skills.  I enjoyed the previous Brown books in spite of his amateurish writing -surely he would have listened to legions of well-intentioned critics and tidied up some of his most egregious barbarisms?   But sadly, no.  In 'Angels and Demons' and 'The Da Vinci Code' people were often prone to chuckling.  When  I come across the word 'chuckle' used seriously in a book I'm tempted to attack the book with whatever weapon is within reach.  Who chuckles?  Yokels chuckle.  Half-wits chuckle.  People watching re-runs of Hee Haw chuckle.  In 'The Lost Symbol' everyone seems to chuckle, from world famous symboligists, to tattooed, demonic, uber-villains to highly intelligent scientists.  To keep my sanity as I laboured through the book, I kept a chuckle-count.  So, if chuckles bug you be forewarned, there are 29 of them in 'The Lost Symbol'.   Another annoying behaviour characters are prone to in DB books is letting their jaws fall open when they encounter something astonishing or unexpected.  How often do you really see jaws drop outside of cartoons or dental offices?  I'm happy to report that the jaw drop count (which also includes mouth gapes and mouths falling open) only totalled 6 for 'The Lost Symbol', which I believe may be down somewhat from 'The Da Vinci Code' jaw drop count.     In addition to vexing writing habits, DB commits plot atrocities in 'The Lost Symbol' that would embarrass F.W. Dixon.  When Mal'akh, sitting in his Turkish jail cell, overhears Peter Soloman talking to the prison warden through a vent, I almost pitched the book.  Come on, a prisoner's cell has a vent connected to the warden's office that allows him tolisten in on confidential conversations?  This is only one of the more outrageous among many dodgy plot anomalies and unconvincing behaviours and characterizations in the book.    Speaking of F.W. Dixon, with all of the negatives associated with DB's writing, why do so many people still read him?  Well, the standards of many people are not that high to begin with -just look at the best sellers lists.  With DB though, my theory is that it is mostly a guy thing.  We yearn for those pre-adolescent days, before we had to worry about girls, cars, real estate, and making money -when we could just kick back and, with a Coke, a bag of chips and a chocolate bar, lose ourselves in a good brainless Hardy Boys adventure.  As I said in my Amazon.com review of 'The Da Vinci Code', DB's books are Hardy Boys for adults -fast paced, stock characters, scary bad guys, no sex, simple dialogue, travel, and lots and lots of action.      As with 'Angels and Demons' and 'The Da Vinci Code', 'The Lost Symbol' introduces the reader to some intriguing architecture and some interesting facts -but this time there isn't enough  of this to balance out the bad writing, awkward plotting, and general implausibility of the whole farrago.  The sludgy ending was extremely anti-climactic and seemed to go on forever with the mushy Noetic science exposition reminding me of 'The Celestine Prophesy' balderdash.  DB had six years to clean up his writing and come up with something good and this is what he gave us.  He and his publisher are clearly quite satisfied with the status quo and are not interested in improving their product.  And I am not interested in reading another DB book.
1416550534|4.0|This book reminded me of Daphne du Maurier's \\"Rebecca\\", which was made into one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.  It seems a little slow moving at first, but I believe Morton is establishing strong characters, which is essential in understanding the significance of the powerfully twisted ending.
B00275EGWY|2.0|I watched this film after it won the Academy Award and was really puzzled by the acclaim it got. It's not really a very good movie. The main problem is how completely unbelievable the actions of the main character were. He just keeps initiating dangerous, unauthorized actions that place himself, his unit and the war effort itself in needless jeopardy, usually with no explanation or apparent reason.  The audience is left to guess that he's working out his own deeply-rooted psychological issues, but it seems highly unlikely that the military would allow anyone to keep going rogue like that: contrary to the filmmaker's mythic vision, there are rules of engagement and a chain of command in the military -- that's the way things work.  Sure, a lot of errors and bad judgment calls were made in the Iraq war, but I doubt they looked anything like this, and besides, the filmmaker seems to be saying that all this guy's crazy rule-breaking was a *good* thing, just the sort of wild, intuitive cowboy-upping that we'd need to win the war. Sounds like BS to me -- the military wins by disciplined, methodical action, having a clear game plan so that when things do get chaotic, you can still prevail.<br /><br />Speaking of chaos, the film itself seemed rather poorly made, particularly in key action sequences, such as the bomb defusing outside the UN compound: just what the heck is going on in that scene?  Mostly, all I could tell was that a certain level of tension was established, after which the motivations and actions of various participants were rather unclear, and then after several poorly-choreographed minutes, the scene ended and we were told to go on home, nothing left to see here. I thought the script was pretty weak, the execution kind of clumsy and the editorial viewpoint rather unclear. Most, though, it's just not very believable that the US military would put up with the showboating and insubordination of the main character: they would just demote him and have some other guys do the work instead. (Axton)the work instead. (Axton)

0618711678|5.0|After reading a book about Zaire's Mobutu, I wanted to learn more of the colonial history of the Republic of Congo. Of course the story is heartbreaking-- how can it not be? But also, it is fascinating too for its description of lobbying of US congressmen by King Leopold-- yup, they could be bought just as easily then-- and the public relations work of the nascent human rights movement.
B003405MF6|2.0|Though this is a \\"pretty\\" album in the soft rock sense, backed by orchestral strings, this will be a decided let down for anyone seeking the more dynamic and adventurous work that has made up the bulk of Beck's discography, establishing his reputation as one of the finest electric guitar players for over 40+ years.    I've listened to this once and am unlikely to listen to it again, unless for background music or the benefit of someone that doesn't care much for rock, jazz, or electric guitar... Naw, not even then!  Instead I'll file this in forgotten, a sop to being a Jeff Beck completist.      Perhaps the worst and least interesting album this artist has ever produced.  Most dramatic thing about it is the eagle on the cover.
B00023B1LC|5.0|My favorite of the trilogy.  Good action and snappy dialog. The premise of the movie, a CIA assassin hunted by his own agency makes for thrills and chills. Love Matt Damon, too.
B001993Y2C|5.0|I won't rehash the previous reviews.  This is simply great drama, rendered perfectly (or nearly) on Blu-ray.  Right now (April 2010), Amazon is selling the the complete series in the old packaging for $[...], and \\"The Plan\\" for ~$16.  The same discs are available in the new improved packaging for $210.  Through May 31, 2010, Universal is sending the new packaging to customers who bought the complete series in the original packaging.  Contact Universal ([...])for complete information.   The newer packaging is much better.  Discs won't be damaged as they're taken in and out of the box, and there are episode descriptions for each disc on the season boxes.  All in all, a big improvement and a nice gesture from Universal to those who bought the set early on.    Also, Amazon is offering bundles of the complete series with \\"The Plan\\" and \\"Razor.\\"  Both the broadcast and extended versions of \\"Razor\\" are included in both the new and old complete series boxsets.  \\"The Plan\\" is not part of the old boxset, but is included in the new one.
031606792X|3.0|Well, I was glad to finish the last installment of this book.  I'm still sitting here saying \\"Wait a minute!.  What happened here & how did she go so wrong with it all??\\"  If I didn't know better, which I do, I would think 2 people wrote these 4 installments.  The first book was written by one & the last 3 by another.  What a contrast & paths of sheer ludicrousy & complete unbelievability factor into this last fiasco.  I read the book last fall so it's difficult to remember the haze of all the nonsensical paths this book took.  Here's just a few:<br /><br />The way the baby was eating Bella alive, the events of how the half baby/half vampire became born, developed teeth like a 5 yr old in no time.  I actually had to put the book down several times & just laugh to myself at the stupidness & total unbelievability factor.  The baby was hunting with them with full teeth at 9 months old or something like that.  I laughed til my belly hurt at that one so for me, it was still worth it to read the book.  The comical side of it was some of the belly laughs it brought from it all being so ridiculous.<br /><br />Barely any details of the wedding, Bella's lack of excitement for it or anything really, this book lacked the charm of the first as well.  The author is still writing Bella in a rather unlikeable view.  So much much more that could have been done with these 3 installments instead of the route the author chose to go.  Even the Volturi fight at the end was lacking any real suspense or page turner.  Everything got sewn up in a neat little pocket whether it fit nice or not.  Jacob imprinting on the baby with the god awful name was creepy.  But of course, Jacob had to have someone to bay at the moon eternally with.  Why it couldn't have been one of the werewolf girls, especially the one he got close to, made more sense to me.  And since the baby will be full grown by 7 yrs. old, Jacob will not have to wait long.  They can probly be married by the time she's 8!<br /><br />I think the author should seriously go back & rewrite everything past \\"Twilight\\".  You have this sensationally best selling book for all ages & then the author goes & changes EVERYTHING about it!  She apparently lacked the common sense to see that you stay with what readers want.  They loved the love story between the vampire & human girl.  So she immediately comes out with a book & movie that deletes Edward & family & throws in a werewolf boy for the girl.  Very assinine to do & I wasn't surprised sales plummetted faster than a plane hitting the ocean.  Give up Jacob, make him a friend only with Bella from school & take the path the first book ended on, which focused on the developing love between a girl & a vampire & his frequent interactions with his loveable & good looking vampire family fighting off the \\"bad\\" vampires.  More of Victoria, the evil redheaded vampiress, would have been welcomed too.  What started out with a bang heard around the world, ended up being a cap gun & it capped out fast.  Good news is because of all the fans \\"Twilight\\" generated, myself included, readers would be back for whatever else Stephenie would throw at them.  The remaining 2 movies will be box office hits for awhile.ould seriously go back & rewrite everything past \\"Twilight\\".

B00337KM2S|5.0|Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is in the air 322 days a year, flying from one city to another to fire people. Business managers are too cowardly to terminate their employees personally, so they hire they hire the firm Bingham works for to do it for them. Bingham, we are soon convinced, is just plain cold. As fired employees cry, explode in anger or express thoughts of a hopeless future, Bingham sends them on their way to a new life.<br /><br /> Clooney is simply superb in this role. Charming, though we want to hate him for what he does.<br /><br /> He is also an isolated man. Ryan Bingham has no attachments. No wife, present or former; no children; just a distant relationship with his sisters. He hates the 43 days a year he has to spend at \\"home\\", a sparsely furnished, small apartment.<br /><br /> Again, only a guy like Clooney supported by a brilliant script and direction could handle this rule. If it weren't for Clooney, we'd tune out and walk out quickly.<br /><br /> The story is carefully constructed. Just as we are about to consign Ryan Bingham to nothingness, he meets a woman at a hotel bar. Alex (Vera Farmiga) is apparently like Ryan: forever on the road, with apparently nothing tying her down. They get very friendly and the scene of them comparing flight schedules to figure out their next liaison is hilarious.<br /><br /> Ryan is called back to the office. The firm is going to cut costs and adopt new technology by firing people using webcams on the internet, courtesy of a scheme developed by the young college gad Natalie, who is brilliantly played by Anna Kendrick.<br /><br /> Coming off the road would be a disaster for Ryan: he loves flying from place to place, never being at \\"home\\". He also has a secret goal, something he desires more than anything.<br /><br /> Bingham objects to the new plan as being heartless and he is ordered to take Natalie on the road.<br /><br /> The road trip exposes the arrogant Natalie to real life in more ways than one.<br /><br /> There is a drive to an end - and I'm not going to tell you what it is.<br /><br /> But the final third of the film is something of a tour d'force of emotion. It does not end as you might expect it to, but it does conclude in an oddly fascinating, if not satisfying, way.<br /><br /> If you like extremely well done sophisticated comedy, you owe yourself a viewing of this film. It is truly excellent.<br /><br />JerryBut the final third of the film is something of a tour d'force of emotion.

B000093OUA|4.0|In the case of Gary Moore the answer is, Yes.  Although I am not not a blues fan the title track is as fantastic as any guitar music.  Gary really puts himself into his songs and the intrumental breaks on this track are awesome.  Otherwise I go for King Of The Blues, a strong tribute to Albert King, but not much else.  So there it is, Still Got The Blues, well not after listerning to this !
B000QCUB8I|4.0|Justice's debut album,  (Cross), launched a new genre of digitally composed music when it came out in 2007.  The Parisian duo of Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Auge stumbled upon their unknown musical talents in the early 2000s.  They are best known for their image and style of music: a mix of strong rock and indie influence with distorted synths and hard cut bass lines.  This style is excitingly innovative, sometimes sounding of equal parts funk, disco, acid house distortions, and hip-hop rhythms.  When recording in their production studio, the duo uses several recording interfaces and software sequencers; when performing live, they are surrounded by two columns of 9 Marshall amps running Ableton on their MacBook Pros.  Justice is an out-of-this-world down-to-earth team of expert composers that shows us that amateur techniques can make it big.  The album as a whole shows a biblical connotation, hence the album title and some track names, yet each track on the album displays its own technique of digital composition.  The first track on the album, \\"Genesis,\\" playing along with the biblical connotation shows the beginning of existence.  Possibly the most widely known song on the album, it has been sampled many times in the media, appearing in video games, songs, movies and being featured in television shows and commercials.  What many people do not realize is that the song itself includes several samples in the form of \\"microsamples\\" - not long enough to distinguish where they came from, even to the original artist.  Throughout the album, about 400 different tracks were microsampled and used in its tracks.  In \\"Genesis\\" especially are samples of Slipknot (just tiny bits of voices), Queen, and the handclap from 50 Cent's \\"In Da Club.\\"  \\"Waters of Nazareth\\" evokes the group's original idea of making an opera-disco album.  A first listen does not make it sound like disco, but if you can forget the hard bass lines and distortions, it sounds like a basic disco rhythm.  The song resonates a sort of evil texture and, when blasted, would cause every cell in your body to shake in different directions.  \\"Let There Be Light\\" plays off a simple drum and bass beat with use of modulation frequency.  The song starts with four variations of pitches of a simple frequency beat and explodes with more frequency variations and bass line.  \\"Valentine\\" incorporates sweet melody with sounds of grains or sand in the background.  \\"Newjack\\" integrates samples of different words and voices to create new words and sounds as such \\"Duridah Dura Duridah\\".  \\"The Party\\", \\"DVNO\\", and \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\" are the only three tracks that include lyrics along with the music.  \\"DVNO\\" sounds like a futuristic robotic jam and incorporates a little bit of phasing and a catchy tune.  \\"The Party\\" incorporates actual samples of voices to embellish the singing.  \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\" is one of a kind (one of the more attractive songs) and was created as a tribute to Michael Jackson and the lyrics is the only one to use a children's singalong.  \\"Stress\\", \\"Phantom\\", and \\"Phantom II\\" are more of the wordless tunes and punctuate heavier bass lines with crazy amounts of synth.  \\"Stress\\" has string beats piercing the rhythm while the two Phantoms have string with a nice build-up, climax, and drop of the beat.   On a last note, each individual track functions on its own, however the whole album itself functions as a whole.  Typical of French tradition, Justice cleverly ends each track with the beginning beat of the next track without making it seem awkward.  The whole album may be divided into tracks but in reality it is one song, one entity, and one story.   Justice has been compared to Daft Punk a lot as many people criticize that Justice adopted their sound from Daft Punk.  Although some of the synths or software instruments used sound similar, Justice has a different persona and technique to their beat.  All I have to say is that Justice does not use the same beat and repeat it for 7 minutes.  Iwould also note that without daft Punk, the genre would not be existent and Justice would not have the street credit that it currently possesses.  This 13-track album was a commercial success and Justice is constantly growing in popularity.  The album ranges in its sound, from video game music to old synth beats and pop dance music as Auge and de Rosnay show off their sampling and synth talents.   (Cross) proves that Justice knows to how sequence music and avoid boredom, permanently rearranging the face of electronic music.
B000002KIE|4.0|There is a hilarious story about the Ramones playing in England.  Johnny Rotten was in the house, and sort of lurking about outside the Ramone's dressing room.  Someone asked if he wanted to meet the band.  He replied that he did, but he was afraid that they would beat him up.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Yes, I have plenty of disappointed customers who wanted 3D, special features, extended cuts, etc. but as it has been playing in the store since last week - it sells itself. No need to rehash the film or specs - I think I have read 50 different outlines here of it all - just checking the outcome.<br /><br />Testing on a variety of plasma and LCD displays, I was very pleased with how the presentation has come across. If the LCD panels are not tweaked to a certain extent the Navi can appear almost fake it is so clear. But the benchmark scenes throughout the film color and fill the displays in every way imaginable. I enjoyed the fact that there were no trailers or ads to fill either disc. There is only one insert for the online registration of fun sites and activities. The sound is mixed to a fulfillment level that exceeded how I thought it would be. The animal/jungle sounds fill every channel perfectly. I pause checked a hundred different spots and saw nothing to pick apart. I even tried/paused the listed goofs on various sites and I could not find several of them now.<br /><br />The menu itself plays nice with moving scenes and pics in HD. The only manipulation is for bookmarks, otherwise as has been rehashed a million times - nothing else to review. A standard two disc BD case with each disc on their respective side (no hinges). I did not care to ding this set for what is not there - just for how excellent the presentation is and value for getting two items.

B000002UC5|1.0|Sir Paul should have the good sense to withdraw this from the market to ensure that no one else wastes any money purchasing it.  It is 28 minutes long.  Most of the songs are fragmentary at best.  I tried to consider this a reflective album.  Can't do it.  I tried to think of this as a celebration of domestic/tranquil/simple living.  Can't do it.  It is just horrible.  I can only assume that listening to this POS turned Elvis Costello into a misanthrope.
B0035WTE2U|3.0|If you aren't fan get it.  But, if you are, you are just collecting dust...  I'm pretty happy about the track listing on the album.  There are countless songs that have not gotten the spot light like others did.  \\"The Razors Edge,\\" is a great tune, the title track from their 90's album.  I would say that is their most underrated album, \\"The Razors Edge\\" tops everything in the Johnson era, except Back in Black and Black Ice I would say.  The DVD's video's are cool too, but it's nothing compared to Donnington.  I'm sorry, that was their best concert ever.    ***** out of *****, that's what spells ac/dc.  They'll always be a classic band.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|Plastic box was broken on the edges, but the dvd's were excellent condition. Otherwise everything about the purchase was done very professional. I would definately use seller again.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|The New Atkins is a great book detailing the newest low carb diet recommendations. But the Kindle edition doesn't even have a table of contents so you can get to a particular chapter! This isn't a book you want to just read cover-to-cover - you need to be able to refer to charts and look things up. Yes, I've been bookmarking things as I read but the experience is very frustrating. Buy it in paperback, it is totally worth a few extra dollars.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I've worked with a variety of business-class routers and APs, and the WAP4410n is one of the, if not the, most reliable I've used.  No lockups, no slow-downs, no failure to route packets to ethernet, none of the issues that plague so many consumer-grade (and more than a few enterprise-grade) devices lately.  (not to mention the vast number of APs and routers offering 802.11n but not gigabit ethernet, so that 200mbps+ wireless is limited to 100mbps talking to anything not on the 802.11n - whose dumb idea was THAT???)    Be aware that Power-Over-Ethernet is a bit trickier than represented.  Cisco support will suggest using a linksys POE adapter, but DON'T DO IT.  The unit they recommend is two pieces - one injects power into the four wires unused for 10/100 ethernet cabling, and the other strips that power back off and provides a 12v plug that jacks into the AP.  This is NOT how POE is supposed to work, and it also limits the AP to 100mbps ethernet.  (be aware also that - based on my experience - Cisco tech support for this unit seems to be the same clueless script-jockey tier 1 phone attendants that support the consumer-grade linksys products)    The proper POE solution uses something like the Phihong midspan 20w POE injector (POE20U-560G - purchased it and AP from buydotcom, which was the lowest price on the AP here at Amazon when I ordered) - this uses phantom power to send 48v over four wires that ALSO carry data - you can run the cable well over 200ft with no issues, and you can attain full Gigabit ethernet speeds at the same time.  The Ethernet port on the WAP4410n is 802.3af compliant so it properly supports POE on that port, there's no need to strip it back out and have a separate power plug into the router.    Just make sure you use a proper gigabit midspan POE injector (if using POE at all), and everything works beautifully. (Oh, and if you've not read it elsewhere, understand that you will usually NOT be able to jack a PC directly into it to set up, you'llneed them both on a switch or hub since the ethernet port on the AP does NOT support auto-crossover correction)
B00004T9VY|2.0|Just wasn't impressed by this album. I don't know where to begin, just no songs I liked, but I can't put my finger on why I didn't like them
B001AQR3E4|5.0|I really love this movie. Seen it before.. just bought a blu ray player so I had to buy it !!
B00005Q5WC|5.0|I have spent many hours listening to this cd and I would spend the money all over again, anytime! I guess Bob Marley makes me feel happy. Well worth every penny you spend for it. Mellow
0714843377|4.0|Why do I like this book?     It's short, simple, and to the point...and yet it's one I can go back to time and time again.    Great for those visionaries that really want to change the world, or at a minimum, their own.    Buy it, read it, love it.
B0013K8IFU|5.0|There are albums that change the trajectory of genre of music, \\"Selected Ambient Works 85-92\\" is one of those albums. Nothing preceding this release featured this flavor of minimal electronic music. Without \\"Selected Ambient Works\\" there would be no \\"Boards of Canada\\", \\"Future Sounds of London\\", \\"µ-Ziq\\", \\"Autechre\\", \\"Squarepusher\\" etc.     This is the Aphex Twin masterpiece, the album that no electronic enthusiast should be without.
B00319ECGU|5.0|I just received this box set and watched the first two movies (i.e., Dirty Harry and Magnum Force). The movies look great. This set only comes with the movies and no extra books. I am not sure what the other box set looks like, but this one kicks butt. Worth the money. Good job.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this to use on my large BabyJogger II-20, which was given to me by a friend w/big kids now.  I'd sorely missed a place to put my stuff while walking!  This is at least equal to the BabyJogger brand console (an extra $30 after buying a $220 stroller) on my City Mini, honestly.  It does the job well and I have it situated to where it doesn't swing when walking.  It easily holds a LOT of stuff and attaches even to the wide BJ handle.  I have no complaints, especially for the price!
0061537969|5.0|I really loved this book.  I currently have an eight year old golden retriever who is the most special dog.  I become sad at the thought of losing him and found the concept of why a dog is on earth to be very helpful.  In my heart I know my sweet dog will become the most terrific person on earth.  I usually don't read books knowing a dog/pet is going to die, but the way it began gave me a sense of peace.  Enzo as the narrator was very clever.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I see several comments and reviews that are bashing this particular DVD simply because there are no special features... Who really cares? Seriously? I think I have watched the special features on DVD *maybe* 2 times in my entire life. I don't know anyone that cares about special features.     As for 3D technology. I highly doubt it is perfected at this point. So, there is no need to rush out and buy a 3D ready HT system for probably another year, at least. However, after seeing this movie in 3D twice in the theaters, I do think that seeing it in HD will not be as rad as seeing it on a massive theater screen. Also, IF you happen to already have a 3D ready system, I highly doubt it will come close to the theater experience, unless you have a 3D HD projector and THOUSANDS, and I mean THOUSANDS of dollars wrapped up in your mini theater. I doubt the average consumer has the want, or knowledge of such things. What's my point?! I don't have one. LOL. I am just sharing my thoughts.     Basically, if you loved the movie and you don't give a rip about special features and scenes that WEREN'T in the movie, then I am sure that this will suffice. Avatar was a great movie, with state of the art 3D and HD \\"stuff\\". Not having a state of the art 3D ready system will more than likely make the movie not as good as it was in the theaters, however. So, just be ready for some disappointment in that sense.     I rated the item based on the movie in the theaters. Obviously.
B00005N7Z1|4.0|In the 80's sci-fi/action classic, \\"Robocop,\\" Peter Weller plays newbie cop Alex Murphy, whom, after being ruthlessly gunned down by a crime boss and his cronies, is resurrected as a cyborg. As Robocop, Murphy is the ultimate in law enforcement, cleaning the streets of a crime-ridden Detroit (in a not too distant future that we have likely surpassed by now) all while being haunted by some unpleasant memories.<br /><br />\\"Robocop\\" is the breakthrough film from director Paul Verhoeven, whose reign over the action genre was short-lived but certainly left a mark. Like all of his best films, it pushes the envelope and the limits of good taste, all in the name of good entertainment. Verhoeven combines a bit of social commentary with his high-energy, over-the-top style, but thankfully, it still makes for a film that can be appreciated on a superficial level, too. It's just that \\"Robocop\\" matches its giddy goriness and intense action with some unexpected substance, and that's okay. All of this is achieved, of course, with the assistance of some solid special effects, stop-motion animation that surprisingly still looks good and a score that sticks in your head for days.<br /><br />In all honesty, though, there isn't much going in the character department. Peter Weller pulls through, and in spite of the fact that he isn't given much to do besides walk around in an obviously uncomfortable and cumbersome outfit, still manages to bring a human element to his Robocop counterpart. Kurtwood Smith (TV's \\"That 70's Show\\") lays it on a little thick as the main baddie but keeps the energy pumping through its final act, while Paul McCrane (TV's \\"ER\\") has perhaps the most memorable (read: revoltingly awesome) scene in the film. Verhoeven paces the film just right so that you don't have time to notice its lack of substantial characters and all you can do is just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a great ride it is, as in spite of its minor flaws, \\"Robocop\\" still holds up and manages to entertain after all these years.r all these years.
0385523386|5.0|Piper Kerman has a lot of heart. Her insightful and restrained style paints a portrait for the anxieties, angers, fears, and joys that one would imagine experiencing with a year in federal prison without an overstated sense of drama. A very empathetic portrait of humanity.  I really enjoyed reading this book
0307266303|4.0|Amazingly, this book inspired me to want to run, even though I'm both terrible at it and I think that the body isn't really made to run. On the other hand, how in the world do those people run so far without that much pain? It's almost ridiculous to believe.    McDougall writes with great fervor for running; his story starts like many others, injured by running, he seeks to find the answers to why he can't run correctly. His own story is subservient to the story of the Tarahumara and their superb running skills and Caballo's quest for an ultimate race between the legendary runners and the modern runners.    The best part of the book was reading about the Tarahumara kids racing with balls and the description of the pure joy that they felt. In addition, meeting all of the racers, Barefoot Ted, the kids, Scott, they were all so vivid.  Luckily, McDougall ends the book pretty much at the right time. Like Zinssler says in On Writing Well, it's important to stop telling the story at the right time rather than belaboring the point. The end of the race marks a natural ending point in the story.
B002E2M5IC|2.0|I'm starting to think dark comedies are like inside jokes.  Only people in the know are allowed in on what's funny.  Also, a fan of the Coens, but unless you're Jewish and privy to the culture, you like myself won't get some of the humor here.  More like a Dramedy, a study in characters where the humor is very subtle.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|This is a GREAT movie about a very plausible situation. A MUST-SEE!! An Alien ship, transporting hundreds of Thousands of Alien population malfunctions and they are obliged to land here on earth. This is an important detail, because later on you will get to understand that they are both technologically and socially much more advanced than us, and they would have not chosen earth as a destination. Actually as they were maneuvering a smaller aircraft coming from the main ship lands, but that is a minor detail that will only become major later. In any case we get to the main ship and bring the aliens down to earth, they were weakened and needed food, so the decision was made to transport them all down to a refugee camp as a 'temporary measure' they somehow were able to breath fine, and particularly enjoyed cat food. The main ship remains afloat Johanesburg in South Africa and down below the Aliens live in a camp that quickly turns into a funky slum. What is great about the movie is making the transition between Alien exotica and 'everyday Alien\\", we see them interchanging with humans, trading, and constantly moving about. Although they look like human sized lobsters, and are referred to as \\"Prawns\\" they pretty much have the same configuration as ours.     The movie starts actually a full twenty years after the 'landing' so all the glamor of news and novelty is gone and the South African Government is just trying to move them to another district, further away from their capital city by forced eviction. At this point the man in charge of the operations, Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley gets infected by a canister that contains a liquid two of the aliens had been hard at work for a long time. He does not know this, he thinks they are gangsters because their hut is full of computers and weaponry, but in reality they are the scientists amongst the aliens that have been working all this time to fix the spaceship, when he accidentally sprays some of the contents onhimself he starts triggering a genetic reaction that will slowly change him into one of the creatures in a slow but very visible way. The strong, excellent performance by Wikus is what makes it believable, he is a totally square and regular guy, actually pretty good natured and in the process of this horrific change he maintains his humanity and sanity and has a complete change of heart in his relationship to the Aliens, as he is forced by circumstance to 'bond' with the one scientist who was involved in making the liquid, and his small son.    The film is important in showing the complexities of the exchanges with the Aliens and covers full well the political intrigue and inhumane behavior that is part of our present state of evolution. It starts out very slow and is not particularly great in the introduction of this information, so that at one point I was getting very impatient, but then started to enjoy the flow of the story. The turning point was the intervention of the liquid that changes Wikus and everything about the movie from that point forward. A rare instance in SciFi where violence is not gratuitous and all the tech makes perfect sense. It will doubtlessly become a cult film.
B000W74EQC|3.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />I'll start out with what I love about \\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone.\\"  It mixes realism and fantasy and hearkens to a wide selection of well-known predecessors.  It's a high-powered version of \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks,\\" with a little \\"Star Wars\\" and even \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" thrown in. In comparison with those movies, that is also its main fault as the storyline in this movie is fairly cliched and threadbare, despite the best efforts of screenwriter Steve Kloves.<br /><br />Featuring an all-star gallery of British and United Kingdom acting talent, the film manages to significantly cover up a fairly uneventful runtime by sheer force of their efforts.  The cast includes Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, as well as Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall and the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore.  Most impressive, however, are the junior members of the cast.  Daniel Radcliffe is wonderful in the title role, and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also superb as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively.  Tom Felton, as Harry's young enemy Draco Malfoy, is very impressive as well and rounds out a very solid core of child actors in this film.<br /><br />The movie overcomes a plodding, paint-by-numbers approach to laying out its key storytelling elements to deliver an exciting climax.  As a parting comment, am I the only one who noticed the extreme similarities between the names \\"Lord Voldemort\\" and \\"Lord Vader?\\"
B000000ZKD|5.0|This is a wonderful \\"translation\\" of Abbey Road. Only a few lyrics, and very soothing music, but still has the rock and roll. The Beatles should be proud of this re-make.
0375842209|5.0|World War II... Nazi Germany...  Death as a narrator...  A little girl trying to make the best of a bad situation...  The Book Thief is an excellent read that puts a twist on a well-documented moment in time.  Balancing fact and fiction, M. Zusak weaves a tale that is magical, frightening, and so human.  If you are even remotely interested in the history of World War II, you will love this book.  It will make you laugh, cry, and contemplate the precariousness of life.
1554072840|5.0|My 19-month old daughter LOVES Prudence and her potty. The book encourages interaction while reading, and, although my daughter is still too busy to sit down and really try to go potty, she definitely knows what the potty is for and what goes into it. Alona Frankel's book is simple, straightforward, and really appeals to both parents and children. I definitely recommend this for people who are looking for a no-pressure book to read while helping kids learn about the the process involved in going to the bathroom.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This is vintage Holmes.  The story is about a person who seems to have supernatural powers and tries to bandy together a group of loyalists from the parliament to control the country.  My daughter watched the movie and shouted, mid-way, \\"Dad, this is black magic!\\".  The 'black magic' is extremely convincing.  And when Sherlock Holmes explains all the supernatural phenomena, my daughter was completely flabbergasted.  She did say, \\"Dad, there is no black magic - everything has to have a reason\\".  IF any movie can send that message to children, I think it has more than achieved its objective.  On the side, I watched the movie before she did and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.  I highly recommend it for family viewing (it is PG-13 rated).
1554684838|5.0|In A Reader's Guide at the back of my copy, McCann says, \\"The thing that matters most to me are the words on the page, how they meet, how they touch.\\" I thought his words met and touched in a very profound way,  penetrating deeply, going far beneath the external, the superficial, or the obvious, defining a little world within a great world.<br /><br />About the novel, McCann said, \\"I wanted it to be a Whitmanesque song of the city, with everything in there, high and low, rich and poor, black, white, and Hispanic. Hungry, exhausted, filthy, vivacious, everything this lovely city is. I wanted to catch some of that music and slap it down on the page so that even those who have never been to New York can be temporarily transported there.\\" I thought he succeeded beautifully -- it's all in there (even young and old). I was transported back to New York, to that time and place. I was living it along with the characters.<br /><br />He also said, \\"The question, as a writer, was how to find meaning at all when there was, in plain sight, a world charged with meaning. If everything meant something--even a child's simple question about burning--then how was it possible to create an alternative meaning, or more exactly a novel?\\" I felt like I knew these characters. I felt so much empathy for them.<br /><br />An excerpt from page 123: \\"His most famous film, Antioch, was a portrait of an old building being demolished on the waterfront. Beautiful, patient shots of cranes and juggernauts and swinging headache balls caught on sixteen-millimeter. It anticipated much of the art that came behind it--light filtering in through smashed warehouse walls, window frames lying over puddles, new architectural spaces created by fracture.\\"<br /><br />This is a remarkable novel. I could read it again.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I was skeptical about watching this show. I really liked the books, and feared that the CW was going to pull in another Gossip Girl, 90210 show, only this time with fangs. I was pleasantly surprised to find an intelligent, dark show that brings in the love that makes Twilight so great, and the darkness of living the vampire life that works for Interview with the Vampire.<br />First, Ian Sommerholder is amazing as Damon, and the evolution of the character is apparent through his great acting.<br />Paul Wesley, oh, lovely and gorgeous Paul Wesley...well yeah, he's great. I know that's not the most intelligent thing to say, but I really do think that he brings intelligence, passion, and a fierceness to his role that is hard to put into words.<br />Nina Dobrev, I think is the weakest actor in the cast, but she does a decent job playing Elena. Let's just say I love her much more as Katherine, than Elena.<br /><br />All in all, I love this show, it's fun, dark, and very entertaining.<br /><br />EDIT: NOVEMBER 8TH, 2011<br /><br />I must retract my last statement about Nina Dobrev. In the last season and a half she has become a breakout star in the series, playing multiple characters in just one episode. She is by far just as strong an actor as Ian in the show and I must give credit where it's due.  Bravo Nina, you're a brilliant actress.
0330490192|5.0|Very quick delivery.  I started to read \\"Don't Lets Go To The Dogs Tonight\\" the day it arrived.  It is a terrific read, and it's frightening, it's fascinating, funny, laughable and all a true story.  I have passed it on to several of friends and they enjoyed it as much as I had.  Thanks for offering a great book and a very reasonable price.
B002JODUI4|4.0|Following the advice from numerous suggestions from class, I deiced to find more about Deadmau5. Deadmau5 is a modern technosonic musician specializing in the art of electrical sound synthesis and audio engineering. Deadmau5 is run by Joel Zimmerman and is based in Toronto Canada. Deadmau5 has won many awards in recent years and has produced eight albums since 2006. Looking at some of the more recent work that has been done, the album \\"For lack of a better name\\" was released in 2009 and contains 10 songs.       One of the most iconic distinctions of Deadmau5 is the driving beats and complex rhythms that make up most of their songs. The use of repeated rhythmic patterns was made possible by the advances in sequencers and synthesizers like the Buchla and Moog. The driving rhythm that makes many of the pieces by Deadmau5 so enjoyable is made possible by early those early inventions as well as the work of many people. The rhythm that Deadmau5 uses are made up of one single tempo and stays constant for many of the piece, however the complexity of the rhythms comes from changing time signatures.  This can be heard in the first song \\"FML.\\" The pieces start off with a drum set playing a repeating pattern and a thud of a bass drum is added in.  The pattern slightly changes and a continuous falling tone, also known as a Sheppard tone, is heard for a small duration of time. After it ends the bass line starts and this makes up the rhythm of the piece. It appears to be in triple meter but every so often a measure of duple meter is added. This can also be heard again in the song \\"Hi friend.\\" In this one the constant rhythm is interrupted by a few measures of a different meter. It still remains in duple meter but it changes from common time to one that is cut time.  This change is help by the fact that the melody also changes from an increasing beeping sound to a suspended tone accompanied by the cut time feel with offbeat claps.        The melody in many of their songs is notconsidered to be as an important factor as compared to the rhythm and the underlying bass. This effect makes the piece more suited for dance and clubs were the bass and rhythm are important. In addition the length of many of these pieces combined the rhythm and the bass would make it easy to dance to for a long time. This is not to say all the songs on this album are just straight beats for ten minutes. Often Deadmau5 will add a few measures where the melody is the only thing that is happening. This in the case in the song \\"Soma.\\" Halfway through the piece there is a slow and contrasting piano and synthesizer melody this is then followed by the same rhythm that appeared before the melody break.        Overall the album has many pieces which has catchy rhythms and beats. They will seem interesting because of the use of different types of sounds and samples used. Even if there is no distinct melody used in all the pieces there are pitched beats which make up a melodic rhythmic pattern which is enjoyable. If you are looking for a good song to dance to or something to listen to at a party then any of the songs on this album would be a good choice.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I had to comment about this movie because I was surprised it only got a 3 1/2 star rating. This movie was awesome. Right from the start it was action packed and full of suspense, unpredictable. I thought it was a great movie and a definite must see. If you saw the movie Taken which was also awesome, even though 2 totally different stories, you won't be disappointed.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|This is a fast paced CD and all of the songs are high paced and make you want to move. My favorite song on the CD is Around the World/Harder Better Faster Stronger and I believe it is probably the most well known song of the CD. This song builds you up right from the start with its beat and melody. It is very catchy. The words \\"around the world\\" are repeated over and over again, but it is not annoying and you find yourself singing along most of the time. Then the second robot voice comes in with the other words of the song. The changing beats make the song increase in speed and it goes along with the words of harder, faster, stronger.   A lot of the songs on the CD are accompanied by words that seem to be generated by the computer. Throughout all of Robot Rock/Oh Yea it is hard to tell whether there is something being said or if it is just noise and it adds to the intensity of the song. In this song they are also able to take computer generate noise and adapt it to sound almost like an electric guitar. This is a great effect and adds a rock element to this electronic beat. The song seems to grow and grow as it proceeds and more elements are added into it.  In Touch It/Technology this robot voice is used yet again, but this time is sounds like a female voice. The songs seem to flow together and this song sounds similar to Robot Rock/Oh Yea in the sense of the electric guitar sound. And you can even hear \\"oh yea\\" throughout this song which is obviously heard in Robot Rock/Oh Yeah. This song is more repetitive in nature but catchy as well. It is very hard to listen to one of these Daft Punk songs and not tap your foot to the beat.   Throughout the entire CD there seems to be a lot of intermingling of sounds within the different songs, which gives the CD a feel as if it is almost one long song. Like mentioned in the last paragraph \\"Oh yea\\" can be heard in multiple songs. This is also the case in Television Rules the Nation/Crescendolls and Around the World/Harder BetterFaster Stronger. \\"Around the World\\" is heard in Television and then it is one of the main focuses on Around the World. It is almost as if it is foreshadowing what is to come.   Burnin'/Too Long is another fast paced and energetic song and Face to Face/Short Circuit slows it down a little bit at this point of the CD but not enough to keep you from wanting to dance. I think this is a good idea as they transition into One More Time/Aerodynamic, which I believe to be the best dance song of the CD.   Aerodynamic Beats/Gabrielle, Forget about the World, Prime Time of Your Life/Brianwasher/Rollin' and Scratchin'/Alive, Da Funk/Dadftendirekt, Superheros/Human After All/Rock'n Roll, and Human/Together/One More Time/Music Sounds Better with You/Stardust (Instrumental) round out the end of the CD and fall behind the powerful start to the CD, but are all quality songs.   I would probably rate this CD one of my favorites of this genre. The dance feel and the upbeat tempos make all of the songs exciting and party starting.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|I love Austen and I love this version of Emma.  As my least favorite Jane AUsten novel, I was expecting to generally enjoy watching this movie on PBS but not want to own it. I was pleasantly surprised to be completely wrong.   This adaptation is so good I had to buy it.  It makes Emma's character more understandable and real, with her all too clear weaknesses but gentle heart. The acting is stellar with Romola Garai and Johnny Lee Miller as standouts.  Don't bother with any other film versions of this story.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye West's third album Graduation has not only been a personal favorite but also a huge influence on the track of rap and popular music today. Since its release in 2007, Graduation has sold almost 3 million copies and has been certified double-platinum in the United States. As a hip-hop album, Kanye's lyrical ability shines as his best lines are interlaced with synthesizers and heavy beats. He also heavily relies on sampling other genres of music, particularly in \\"Good Life\\" with its Michael Jackson \\"P.Y.T.\\" re-dub on loop and on \\"I Wonder\\" with the hook courtesy of British folk jazz. The first single off the album, \\"Stronger,\\" is also a clear example of sampling, as it uses a revamped version of Daft Punk's \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" as its back beat. In my opinion, all the tracks are stand-outs, with my personal favorites being \\"Flashing Lights\\" with its heavy synths and \\"Everything I Am.\\" Relating this album back to the past, synthesizers, computer music, and sampling using today's technology certainly shapes the incredible hit-making ability of Kanye's production and lyrical style.    Citing a bit of musical history, Graduation would not be possible today without the development of synthesizers in the 1960s and sampling done in the era of early electronic music. In my opinion, \\"Flashing Lights\\" is the best example of Kanye's use of synthesizers to set the mood for his songs. Adding accents to his 808s and high hats, Kanye uses synth riffs to contrast with the orchestral-like electronic strings with which he lays out his melodies. Although Robert Moog's analog synth definitely contrasts with the FM synthesis modern rap melodies use, it is undeniable that Kanye's use of synthesizers on Graduation signify just how far technology and music have come. \\"Stronger\\" is also a clear throw back to the French electronic group Daft Punk, whose original hit \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" is actually computer-generated voice riffs layered with synthesizers; it seems that just yesterday Max Mathews and his \\"Music 1\\" were being hailed as ground breaking. On \\"Good Life,\\" Kanye also uses a throwback Jackson tune to set up his hook; this \\"sampling\\" from other artists is rampant throughout Graduation, but in my opinion used tastefully. Even on \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing,\\" Kanye uses a woman's voice to create his actual beat texture - this can also be seen as a reference to the early styles of musique concrete and Pierre Henry.    Overall, Graduation is a stellar combination of music technology, marketing, and raw talent. Kanye West, despite his personal indiscretions, remains one of the best rappers and producers in the industry today, definitely defying the genre-based stereotypes of good rap. He really has been ahead of the game \\"since OJ had Istoners\\" - his tracks for Jay-Z's Blueprint (\\"Heart of the City,\\" \\"I.Z.Z.O.\\") have shown his signature style since its release in 2001.

0679722610|5.0|Dashiell Hammett was maybe the earliest hard-core mystery writer, and this novel is tops.  An earlier reviewer said \\"blunt wit\\"--that's dead right.  Hammett can do more with fewer words than any writer I know--poetry but you never notice it.  Humor follows horror follows betrayal.<br /><br />His detective is unusual in belonging to a Pinkerton-type organization, and in other stories cooperates with the police, but here he systematically isolates himself by breaking all rules, betraying one ally after another, refusing to clear himself of suspicion, and generally inciting mass murder.  By the end he's driven away colleagues, his employer, gangster allies, his girlfriend [who he apparently has killed], and any semilegitimate forces such as the police.  He's very conscious he's doing this, and explicitly describes the bloodlusting cultural corruption that he is reveling in, feeding, steering, and using to clash and destroy itself.  He starts counting up the killings at one point, gets up to eighteen or 20, clearly is leaving some collateral damage out, but on he goes.  Initially, Hammett throws in examples of business corruption, police corruption, and gangsterism as everyday asides, but then as his detective undermines the prior balance of power, 'normal corruption' breaks down and the whole town feels the anarchy.<br /><br />Hammett remarkably demonstrates the power of account-giving skills:  his detective tells one story of a murder one time and causes one mob war, then gives a rival account to cause another murder.  He doesn't know the truth, but while searching for it he raises doubt that truth may even exist, as one more account emerges to fit every new cumulated and reinterpreted set of facts.  Thus, he keeps turning the idea of 'mystery story' back on itself into a whirling cesspool--he ends up sort of uncovering the truth, but has created a lot of doubt along the way.<br /><br />One wishes his detective came to the 21st Century US and were hired with the billions of dollars necessary to do a similar job on our politics and economy.  Yes, the dead would need to number in the thousands [at least!], but the improvement in life would be very evident.  One problem is that a major flaw in the US is the current hopeless value-free cynicism [that also infects 'Red Harvest'], and a mass murder of the elite would not solve that--on the contrary.
0670827592|5.0|The book The True Story of the 3 little pigs is a favorite fractured fairy tale book. It is a unique way to look at an old story and learn how to think outside your own perceptions. Fun, and witty.      Product: in great condition, arrived in record time.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I was not really interested in seeing this movie at first because it was in 3D and I sometimes get vertigo but my husband encourage me to go see it with him and I can say that I was so completely immersed in this beautiful story that I forgot that it was in 3D.  Such a beautiful story...I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good heartwarming movie.
1591843065|4.0|It must be great to be in the audience when Dan Roam gives a presentation and when you in the audience share the same kind of visual sense.  On the other hand, if you do not share that sense, that way of structuring the topic under consideration, then you might well want to be beamed somewhere else.<br /><br />This is a great book, extremely useful and thought provoking. The structuring of problem-solving into a six by five visual codex makes enormous sense; you can literally see the evolution of the thought processes and the development of the insights take shape through the pages. It is not the kind of book that you can dip into. There is a structure and that structure has to unfold and be assimilated by the reader before there can be any translation into action and effect.  I think that there is no \\"quick fix\\" for someone who wants to animate or rejuvenate their presentations with a rapid read. The art of solving problems has to be developed through the acquisition of the skills protrayed in these pages. And that takes time and effort. And it also needs a sense of congruity between the visual sense of the author and that of the reader. Pictures can convey so much that words cannot evoke. But some pictures and representations succeed and others fail, otherwise there would be no evolution of art and expression.<br /><br />Be wary of this book on face value. The editorial recommendations of the book do not necessarily reflect the content. Simply to say, as does one commentator, \\"So if you want to make a point, do it with images, pictures or graphics.\\", is true only to a point. It is not necessarily the case for all readers, all viewers and certainly not for all people who need to make a presentation. The person who gives the presentation with pictures that reflect their own representation of the topic without engaging the representation or ability of the audience will fail. The presentation must be expressive, not merely reflective.<br /><br />But that aside, if after searching through this book you get a sense of affiliation with the ideas and concepts, then I have no doubt that you will gain enormously in quality of communication with your audiences. This book is a challenge that can lead to greater insight. But the dictum \\"caveat emptor\\" applies, as always. But also remember, books such as this always present the ideas as though they were tried and true. There is rarely evidence as to the efficacy of the methods in getting the message across, as against the satisfaction that an audience may gain. Roam does list references in an appendix to other works that are based on empirical evidence (for example Wainer's Graphic discovery and Tufte [[ASIN:0961392142 The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd edition]], but there is nothing about his own evidence.

B002I9Z89Y|5.0|I had no idea I would love the original series so much! It is fabulous, and I love all the technical advances and how you have the option of watching it in its original format or the new one... I agree w/many others about the packaging and how the disks don't have the names of the episodes on them, but that is trivial with how much fun it is to own these episodes! I have season one and two and am getting season three for my birthday next month, hooray!
0307454886|4.0|The Dying Animal is a fast-paced, interesting and well-written book about a dirty old man professor who repeatedly seduces his young art students in New York City.  Finally he falls for one and shows some vulnerability.  Although the concept of the book is rather creepy, I enjoyed the plot as well as the writing style.  I read this book in two days on vacation and just soared through it because it was so interesting.  I recommend it for a great vacation read!<br /><br />For more book reviews and other posts of interest to readers and writers, please visit my Blogspot blog, Voracia: Goddess of Words.
B00005A46T|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite \\"nu-metal\\" cds and I still play it going down the road, preferably at midnight, cranking the stereo in an attempt to disturb all those lovers of hip-hop-rap-crap. A crowded driving lane during 5pm traffic is not sufficient if you are trying to drive and head-bang. Desolate night time driving is the way to go! BTW, just make sure you are not too wasted.. lol...<br /><br />All kidding aside, this disc is a step-up in production quality since their first self-titled release, yet it is still very heavy and raw. Corey is one of the best heavy music singers of all time. He can growl, harmonize, and sing a very convincing ballad. A fine example is the song \\"My Plague\\". It is a fine display of how he can be brutal and lovely in his vocal range. The percussion and guitars come out nice and loud in the mix. I am not a fan of squeaky-clean/over-production and this album delivers!<br /><br />Until then folks... I may be right, and I may be wrong, but thank you for reading!
B00005KARK|5.0|So happy to find \\"Dumbo\\" on Amazon, tried to find it for sale in retail stores and no luck.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Being a huge fan of the original Clash of the Titans, even the quirky special effects (which were probably groundbreaking at the time), I had high hopes for this remade version.  Unfortunately, this version almost makes me want to retaliate upon the filmmakers like the gods smote the people of Argos in the original.<br /><br />The story is essentially a Cliff's Notes version of the original, with Perseus (Sam Worthington) saving the citizens of Argos after they angered the gods by destroying temples and statues.  He embarks on a heroic quest, heavy-handedly aided by the gods - because his dad just happens to be Zeus (Liam Neeson) - to save humanity from the wrath of Zeus, unleashed via proxy by Hades (Ralph Fiennes).  If he is unsuccessful, the city's only option is to sacrifice princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) - no fault of her own, just a result of her mother Cassiopeia's ignorance and arrogance - to the Kraken, a sea monster unleashed by Poseidon.  During his journey with some soldiers of Argos, Perseus gets gifts and hints from not only his father, but the beautiful Io (Gemma Arterto - HUGE upgrade to Bergus Meredith), another demigod stuck in the middle of the story.<br /><br />As with many movies recently, dialogue has taken a backseat to special effects and action sequences.  There's a watered down heroic thrust to the movie, and no real incentive for Perseus to save Argos, much less Andromeda; all he wants is revenge on the gods, and the people of Argos are an afterthought.  This is a major flaw considering Andromeda was the driving force of the original quest, and here she's merely window dressing.<br /><br />I think the special effects are the deciding factor for this film.  All are stupendous, but at points it's subtraction by addition.<br /><br />At times the original Pegasus flew straight out of Napoleon Dynamite's notebook, but the 2010 version is outstanding!  A major upgrade.  Each scene trumps the next, convincing the viewer of not only the scene's reality, but fluid movements suggest that a winged horse actually exists.  Great special effects.  The best, however, is clearly Medusa.  Snakes for hair, sinewy muscle, a lethal bow and arrow, a gaze that turns men to stone.  The combination was enough to leave children with nightmares in 1981, and every facet was improved upon.  Add in a sinister laugh and an upgraded crib replete with chasms, razor-sharp stalagmites, \\"liquid hot magma,\\" and the result is one of the scariest supernatural villains ever to appear on film.  (It's just too bad that she's so easy to kill in both version of COTT)<br /><br />On the other hand, the Kraken feels much too extra terrestrial, maybe a bit too Cloverfield for my tastes.  A better option would have been the original Kraken's look with updated FX technology.  For me, the Kraken was a disappointment, but not nearly as bad as the witches.  Ahh...The Stygian Witches, wise sages, toil and trouble, cauldron and bubble, all that jazz.  Their appearance is not nearly as appealing as the original version.  Rather than looking like wise, tormented, evil witches, the new version, once again, looks like alien triplets.  Finally, the completely awesome scorpions.  Perhaps the coolest subplot of both films, the giant scorpions form a dangerous obstacle for Perseus and his fellowship.  The problem with the remake is the scorpions' lethality is minimized when they are turned into nothing more than Clydesdales after an epic battle.  And I'm not even going to discuss Jar Jar Djinn.  Horrible!<br /><br />Verdict: If you fondly remember the original, wait for the rental.  If you don't remember or didn't like the original, you'll probably love this.<br /><br />Jason Elinnts suggest that a winged horse actually exists.  Great special effects.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|This CD lived up to my expectations.  It is classic Sade and won't disappoint.  She isn't trying to be an artist she isn't and for true fans, sticking to her style is a plus.  Normally when an artist makes you wait for their work it is usually not worth it.  For Sade, that couldn't be farther from the truth.
B0037W68F4|1.0|I want my money back! It's not just that there aren't any singles on this album, there's also nothing even remotely worth listening to....which I think is the point. These tortured artists are painfully sick and tired of being rich and famous, so they made an album that no one will want to listen to.  HUGE disappointment after the brilliant Oracular - one of my all-time favorite albums. My well worn copy of Oracular is going to get another listen just so I can cleanse this rubbish out of my head. Congratulations, indeed.

B000WTBMBK|5.0|Burial's second album \\"Untrue\\" reinforces the artist's distinct sound. His compositional method is nothing new. As a production oriented artist, Burial layers and arranges sampled drum beats and vocal phrases, along with other samples and textures in a software environment. These techniques are handed down from the originators of dub-reggae (Burial is considered dub-step). So what makes it sound so unique? The answer lies somewhere in its rich flowing textures and infectious off-kilter rhythms.     Computers have been expanding musical possibilities since early computational music before computers were small enough to fit in homes. Now we have the affordability of personal computers and portability of laptops. Even cell phones these days feature musical applications. Computer technology today has eliminated many of the limitations of acoustic and analog music. From simple recording to synthesis and effects processing, the computer has become a limitless virtual instrument.     Burial's \\"Untrue\\" could not achieve its distinct sound without what computers have to offer. The ability to juxtapose any combination of sounds, musical or environmental, is a technique taken for granted today. Imagine an orchestra trying to project real world sounds without sampling technology. Computers enable the playback of sounds that are not possible in the physical world.     One of the most distinct characteristics of the album is the unique rhythmic qualities from song to song. Not necessarily as complex as poly-rhythms, the beat on every song sounds nothing like what we're used to hearing.  They sound somewhat broken, with strange hesitations in each measure. Strangely, they contribute to a more natural life-like pace than the metronomic beats we normally hear. Adding these rhythms to heavily processed samples and richly textured synth phrases, each song engages the listener's attention through otherwise repetitious looping, just long enough to want to hear the end of the song (not to mention engrain the phrases in our heads).     Mostly, the samples, timbres, and key signatures Burial uses contribute to an overbearing mood that characterizes the album. Minor scales and yearning lyrics create a sense of darkness and emotional pain. The repetition and echo of the beats are reminiscent of a busy and repetitive life in the city, and minor details embedded in the background are ever-present, just like the inescapable anthroprogenic sounds of city life. More so than before computers, music today can express a reflection of the environment, as Burial's music reflects an urban environment.    Somehow, \\"Untrue\\" introduces a completely distinct sound that sets itself apart from any other artists, even though the album uses fairly common techniques. It mostly serves as a testament to the endless utility of computers in music composition and to Burial's creative ability to take existing techniques and make them his own.
1439153663|5.0|I am totally drained after finishing this fabulous fabulous book.  It touched my heart and my soul and my conscience.  It is so heartbreaking that I cried at the end of each chapter.  It is Gone With The Wind and The Help and much much more all tied up nicely in a most beautiful way.  I don't even know now if I am capable of letting go of this book...I literally just finished it and I feel exhausted.  It is the South and the horrible parts of the early 1800's.  It is women and men who are treated lovingly and intimately within these plantation families and after years and years of the most intertwined family service meeting with brutal punishment  for the most trivial  of disobediences.  I can feel the tears now...it is such a masterful story.  The author's reasons for writing this book are almost as compelling as the book itself and the reasons of course are based on fact.  I absolutely hate telling the story of the book within a review...but I will say that it is based on the true story of an educated Irish family who was trying to come to this country. Unfortunately the parents died during the voyage.  The only one who survived was the littlest daughter and The Kitchen House is her story.  The captain of the ship took her home to the South with him to be an endentured servant and her life becomes intertwined with the many slaves that the sea captain owned.  You have to steel yourself for the harshness of this story and usually I shy away from this sort of tale but within the reality of the harsh lives led by these people there was magic and happiness and love.  This is a thought provoking book and I loved every word in it...I began reading yesterday and finished it this morning at noon...I guess it was my own little readathon...This book simply cannot be overlooked.  It is very powerful.

B001993Y2C|5.0|While the packaging was so so, that was not the reason I purchased this item.  True, I did get a deal on it but I bought it mainly for the content not as a trophy I can display on my shelf.  This is one of the best television shows ever created.  While the original series was cheesy and just made to look cool to capitalize on the Star Wars craze, this reimagining actually had drama and excellent writing throughout most of the series.  Unfortunately it's wouldn't be successful in mainstream television because it requires to much thinking.  The writers, directors, musicians and actors all deserve a lot more credit than they received.  Buy it for the content, not for the packaging.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|Action-packed, adrenaline driven and all-out action is what you can expect from \\"Shoot `Em Up\\", a 2007 film directed by Michael Davis.<br /><br />Sure, Davis wrote the 1994 video game based stinker \\"Double Dragon\\" but he did rebound with \\"Eight Days a Week\\" in 1997.  A decade later, Davis has crafted a film that is not only mindless action but it's the kind of action that is plenty of fun, never boring and on Blu-ray, it's a title that sports awesome picture quality and lossless audio.<br /><br />Davis teams up with well-known martial arts cinematographer Peter Pau (\\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", \\"The Promise\\", \\"Perhaps Love\\", \\"The Forbidden Kingdom\\") and composer Paul Haslinger (\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\", \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\", \\"Death Race\\").<br /><br />\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is an action comedy about a drifter named Mr. Smith (played by Clive Owen, \\"Sin City\\", \\"The Boys Are Back\\", \\"The International\\") who is waiting for his bus ride but sees a pregnant woman running away.  Next thing you know, a gun wielding man is after her.  At first, Smith wants nothing to do with it but decides last minute to help her out.<br /><br />As the woman tries to defend herself with a gun, the man is about to kill her but the carrot chomping Mr. Smith quickly acts by stabbing the man with a carrot.  All of a sudden, the woman is giving birth and at the same time, more men have arrived with guns ablazing and Mr. Smith shows his excellent marksmanship and gun skills and takes many of them out and eventually helping the woman give birth to a baby boy.<br /><br />We then see the man who is calling all the shots, a man named Hertz (played by Paul Giamatti, \\"Sideways\\", \\"Cinderella Man\\", \\"Duplicity\\") who doesn't seem too scared of Mr. Smith.  Smith knows he is in a bind without a weapon and thus he tries to get the woman and baby to safety but unfortunately the mother is killed.  Smith must decide to leave or take the baby with him and he decides to help the baby.<br /><br />And next thing you know, Smith becomes a major target as everyone seems to be after the baby for some reason and will do anything to kill it.<br /><br />Smith goes to the only person he knows to take care of the baby for a day while he tries to find out who the men chasing the baby are.  The woman is a prostitute named Donna (played by Monica Bellucci, \\"The Passion of Christ\\", \\"Matrix Revolutions\\", \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\") who has no interest in helping Mr. Smith at all.<br /><br />As Smith leaves, it appears that the men who are after the baby are always a step behind in finding it.  But this time, they have traced Smith and the baby at the whorehouse and immediately Hertz starts to scare and torture Donna for information on Mr. Smith (which she knows nothing).  Fortunately, Smith is able to rescue her in time but now, Mr. Smith, Donna and the baby are on the run from Hertz and his men who will do whatever it takes to kill him and the baby.<br /><br />Will Smith find out why the baby is a target?  Will he be able to protect both the baby and Donna?<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio), the film tends to be saturated with focus on a few colors as you can see blues, greens, blacks, orange and reds being the primary colors of the film.  You literally can see the detail and the hair stubble, the skin pores and the grime on Mr. Smith, you can see the overall grittiness of the city and for the most part, detail is captured quite well on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Blacks are nice and deep, I see no artifacts, DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) or any problems with the picture quality.

For one thing, this is an action film that just doesn't show signs of any long moments of inactivity.  There is just action throughout with maybe a brief segment of dialogue and then more action.  And the keyword to describe this 7.1 lossless soundtrack is \\"immersive\\".  Gunshots, bullets whizzing, car crashing, you name it...you hear it all around you.  From sound effects, footsteps, the music, the baby crying, there is just a feeling of sound that envelops your soundscape and for audiophiles, you will more than likely gush with this soundtrack.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" features the following special features presented in 1080p and 1080i High Definition, 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, 5.1 DTS and 2.0 Stereo DTS.

He loves chomping on carrots, loves his guns and shows sign of being quite an intelligent man.  We don't know his background, but we know that he kicks major butt!<br /><br />And the film is pretty much representative of the fact that Mr. Smith is just the epitome of a man who can kick some serious tail.  Your eyes are literally glued to the screen as there is a sense of choreography when Smith shoots his enemies but you add the sexy Monica Belluci and these two literally set off sparks in the film.  One of the most hilarious and sexiest moments of the film are when Smith and Donna are making love and as he is doing his thing, he is taking on the bad guys while having sex, while Donna is enjoying every minute of it.<br /><br />Another hilarious scene features a mother spanking her child.  Mr. Smith not liking the mother punishing her child in that manner, starts spanking the mother and telling her if she likes how that feels.<br /><br />And there are many of these enjoyable and fun moments of the film but at the same time, the film has its sense of B-movie gore as we see carrots gouging a man's head through the eye socket to body part dismemberments throughout the film.<br /><br />The film is a violent, action-packed film but all its violence and humor just works for this film and definitely enhances the enjoyment of it.  Granted, I'm sure there are some people who may balk about how the baby is put through many violent situations throughout the film but this is an action comedy with farfetched situations. There is no realism, this is all crazy entertainment that resembles the experience of  playing a one player action/adventure video game shooter and instead of you controlling the character and picking people out, Mr. Smith does that for you.<br /><br />As mentioned, the Blu-ray sports awesome picture quality and lossless audio.  I was very impressed by this Blu-ray release and the fact that you can find it for a pretty good price these days is great.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for an action film full of non-stop action and humor with less focus on the drama, then definitely check out \\"Shoot `Em Up\\".  Definitely a Blu-ray worthy of being in your collection if you are interested in an action comedy film with mindless violence!  Prepare yourself for one wild and crazy ride with \\"Shoot `Em Up\\".

I was very impressed by this Blu-ray release and the fact that you can find it for a pretty good price these days is great.    Overall, if you are looking for an action film full of non-stop action and humor with less focus on the drama, then definitely check out \\"Shoot `Em Up\\".  Definitely a Blu-ray worthy of being in your collection if you are interested in an action comedy film with mindless violence!  Prepare yourself for one wild and crazy ride with \\"Shoot `Em Up\\".  A film that is definitely recommended!

I will buy this version, and the extended version as well.  Everything about this version is sound for now. Aspect Ratio is the way James Cameron wanted it to be. Remember people \\"IMAX\\".

0393072231|5.0|[...].    I'd just finished \\"13 Bankers etc\\" and initially \\"The Big Short\\" while an engaging read, seemed a bit lite.  However, I'm now rereading it.  Why?  For the color.  As with \\"Liar's Poker\\" Lewis seemingly gets to the heart of Wall Street's obsessions.
B002S0OBFK|1.0|There seems to be two major viewpoints from audiences regarding this movie. I think it's a case of Hollywood(hyped)horror vs. genuine horror fans. There's the one side that believes it was different, creative and original. Then the other side that expects much, much, much, much more from a film about the paranormal. Going into this film, I actually thought I was going to see an innovation in the genre. What I witnessed was a smack in the face to the general viewing public. While I was watching, I actually felt like I was being laughed at by the cast and crew, for buying into the hype. I am not a gullible person but I almost felt like I was brainwashed into watching this garbage. I found it to be a half ass-ed reality TV rip off of a 4th rate version of Poltergeist. Annoying unbelievable characters + non-existent plot + mindless occurrences = Paranormal Activity.

1847245455|4.0|I'm not sure why I took so long to get around to reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  It's been on my `to be read' list for months.  I'm glad I finally pushed it to the top of the reading list, and thank those that kept encouraging me to read it.  Like most people, I really enjoyed this novel and recommend it highly.  My only minor complaint about the book is that it contains a few too many subplots and a little more detail than is really necessary at times(for example: the description of a laptop might include a complete overview of its processer speed, RAM, Hard Drive capacity, and tons of other information that is completely lost on me.  I get it - the laptop is top-of-the-line and really, really fast).  The complicated Vanger family tree can be a little overwhelming to follow at times (I kept wishing there was a family tree diagram or something to help me keep all the relationships and players straight in my head).<br /><br />But these are minor grievances.  Very minor.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an enormously entertaining, intelligent thriller.  It's a well plotted novel that effectively builds suspense.  Its greatest strength though lies in the development of its characters who are fully realized, complicated human beings.  The mystery of what happened to a young woman who disappeared decades earlier is pretty standard stuff, but this part of the story proves only to be a means to discover darker secrets with far greater urgency.<br /><br />I liked that the story was based in Sweden and has a decidedly different sensibility than most American novels but some readers may be put off by the unfamiliar (and difficult to pronounce) names, but this didn't deter me at all.  I found the Swedish setting and European flavor of the novel to be a welcome change.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of those rare genre novels that transcends its genre by succeeding on multiple levels.  It's a compelling story, a fascinating character study, and a satisfying thriller.  I look forward to reading the remaining novels in the series. 4 ½ stars.ler.

B0038P59A0|5.0|The previews (trailers) didn't do the movie justice, so I didn't see it in the theaters.  The previews presented a constant fighting, action flick with little of the \\"Sheerluck\\" investigation aspects.  So, sitting home the other day, I decided to check it out.  The movie was excellent, well done with balance in all aspects.
B00309YBIA|5.0|First off,this is a review for the Lost season 5 COLLECTOR'S EDITION. I stress that so much because no one else has written a review for THIS collector's edition. So,this edition does have a slipcover,unlike the mass-market edition. It's not a transparent plastic like seasons past,but it is really cool thick paper with holographic images and a back pocket for the bonus disc and Dharna luggage tag (cool promo item!!). The slipcover slides off to reveal the a copy of the mass-market package,BUT with a holographic sheen and is actually a slipcover for a foldout package ala' Lost dvds of seasons past. The mass-market edition packaging was said to have cheap,plastic cases for the dvds and WAS NOT up to par with past editions. I assure all, this edition is top notch and the spine lines up perfectly with seasons 1-4. I've read this was a major sticking point with hardcore fans. This will make up for that snafu,and is worth the 45$ price point. Hopefully,Amazon will post this review with the collector's edition and convince other consumers to grab this edition IF they ever see one for sale.

Only 2 more days till this amazing movie comes out on Blue Ray, Can't Wait!
B0030BOCEG|4.0|First of all, I'd like to advise you guys to not listen to the close-minded people reviewing this album. They have nothing to contribute other than hateful comments like \\"this is not Him, they really didn't try, feelingless junk, His Interest in Money, they should've stayed out of rehab,\\" and other nonesense and yet they call themselves Him fans or Him royalists. What a joke!    Now for the review. Him first caught my attention with Razorblade Romance and I've kept a close eye on them ever since. Their songs have mostly a dark feeling to them mixed with romance and calamity and have been for some time. With this new release, however, we now have a new side of Him to explore-a happier feeling (It was released on Valentine's Day after all!).    This album is different as you might have expected from listening to Heartkiller. The rest of the tracks mimic the same feel of music so if you liked Heartkiller you will probably like the other songs as well. A lot of people critize it as sounding like pop music but thats really not true. Let me remind you that Him is an alternative genre so don't make the mistake of comparing them to metal bands. The lyrics are still Him in its entirety so you won't be dissapointed there (except maybe Scared to Death and Like Saint Valentine).  My favorite songs in order are: Dying Song, Heartkiller, In the Arms of Rain, Disarm Me, In Venere Veritas, and Acoustic Funeral. Check some of them out first if you are on the edge on this one.    The acoustic version of the songs, on the other hand, are not what they could've been. This might be just me, but I think that most of these songs (especially Dying Song) would've sounded a lot better if Ville Valo had sung it with his deeper voice. But who knows, you might like it anyway and they are not asking for too much compared to the single disk album.    Overall, I am very pleased with this album!
B003C5FMEE|5.0|I love this record.  A strong rock album that encompasses multiple influences and stitches them together beautifully without being overly respectful of any one tradition.  The nine instrumentals range from 21st-century New Orleans brass/hip-hop fills to soul jazz a la Grant Green and Jimmy Smith to straight up rock anthems, and the vocal tracks are just as varied, strong and catchy.  Cohesive, flowing, with thought-through virtuoso playing and soloing throughout.  'Backatown' gets the party started...
B00328G4V6|4.0|This is a terrific collection. Most of the tracks have been available from other sources but unless you're a complete fanatic like me who owns every Hendrix title under the sun you probably don't have them and even if you do... the sound quality is extraordinary.    THAT is the good news. Bad news, I was dismayed to learn after ordering that every outlet sells a different version of the product. Walmart has it with a plastic jewel case (think I can live without that), Best Buy includes a t-shirt (yawn), Target sells a version with two additional tracks (say WHAT?).    I certainly don't blame Amazon, I blame Sony and Experience Hendrix for screwing everybody who didn't buy the CD at Target... which I did. I'll likely give the shorter version to some less discerning friend.
B000002L7Y|4.0|I decided to review the debut album of the Norwegian band a-ha called Hunting High and Low, which came out twenty five years ago in 1985. In particular I will analyze my favorite song, Take on Me. It's no surprise it's my favorite track considering back in October of 1985, it was the number one track on the Billboard Hot 100.            Take on Me makes use of a variety of different instruments like the acoustic guitar, keyboards, drums and synthesizers. Most notably it incorporates the use of the Dx7 Synthesizer. From 1983 to 1986 the Dx7 was manufactured by the Yamaha Corporation. The Dx7 was the culmination of the midi device and the fm synthesizer. The fm synthesis technology was developed by John Chowning. After vast experimentation, Chowning created the device which modulates on a periodic waveform with another to create audible sidebands. This technology brought together both digital and computation principles. The midi device was developed as a standard to which other synthesizers could communicate with each other. As for the song itself, it is very catchy and upbeat. The most recognizable sounds of the song were all born from the synthesizer, and written in the key of A major. The band actually met with synthesizer expert, Tony Mansfield, to receive help in creating the sound. The drum beats that play constantly through the background seem to blend perfectly with the sounds of the synthesizer and keyboards to make Take Me On into the vibrant song that it is. The tempo of the song is very quick at around 170 beats per minute, which makes it a perfect song to add to your workout playlist.             The rest of the album is very good also. Many of the songs are very similar, but I would have to say my next favorite song in the entire album is The Sun Always Shines on T.V. It starts out much slower then Take On Me, with mainly just vocals in the beginning; but after a little bit, it starts to pick up, making for a great song to just blast duringa car ride. I would recommend this album for three reasons. One, it is a classic that stands the test of time as still being able to make people bounce their heads up and down and tap their shoes every time certain songs are played. Two, Take On Me is one of the first songs to make use of the Dx7 synthesizer technology and besides this fact, is one of the best singles to ever come out of the eighties. And third, it is an album that is more than just one single, and will have your friends who listen ask you what certain songs are so they can download them on their ipods. I am no expert whatsoever in the music of the eighties, but I know it's a fact that had I been alive, this would have been one of my favorite albums. Hopefully, if you end up purchasing it, you will feel the same way.
1416955070|3.0|This book is just published fanfiction disguised as an original novel.     Is it entertaining? Absolutely. Is it original? No, but originality has been dead for a long time. No excuse for blatant self-plagarism, however. Is it good? I wouldn't call it that, but the entertainment factor plays a big part in disguising this flaw.    The characters are bland, the story is interesting, the humor is strangely the same throughout the novel - sarcastic and witty. It's not realistic, it's not believable. It's entertaining. That's it.     Cassandra Clare also put in a lot of references to her own fanfiction, her friends fictions, anime and manga. Obviously, she was trying to create a fanbase. People who like anime, read Holly Black, fanfiction and are 13 years old might like this story and take it seriously.    It's a good light read or fluffy summer book, but don't cry when you buy it expecting the next Tolkein and get StarPotterBuffy instead.
0393072231|5.0|TERRIFIC BOOK.  In it, Lewis examines the history and causes of the recent (and ongoing?) financial crisis, focussing on some of the (very few) guys who figured out what was going on before the whole thing blew up.  This creates a marvellous frame, since the guys are very interesting guys (and very unusual ones), and since his reporting of their process of discovery helps the reader understand what happened.  He explains the complex securities that greased the wheels more clearly than anyone else I've read: for one brief shining moment I think I understood synthetic CDO's.  Most of what Lewis has to say is  more about mass delusion and an incredible ability to avoid unpleasant truths than it is about outright criminality.  Nonetheless, I very much hope that the SEC lawyers read the book and call on some of its heros for testimony.  Lewis ends the book with a discussion of the fact that not much has changed in the way Wall Street works, despite the crash.  This suggests two things.  One, financial reform a la Volcker is long overdue -- it would be wonderful if every member of the U.S. Congree were to read the book.  Two, the aftermath of the crash is not over yet.  Thank you, Mr. Lewis!  I'm an old Wall Streeter, and I loved \\"Liar's Poker\\" when it cam out.  I love this book too, and I learned a whole lot from it.

B002YIHO7I|1.0|Wow!  When I first heard the song \\"Soldier of Love\\", I thought \\"Great! This is a good new direction for Sade, after all these years.\\"  I was eager to hear the rest of the new songs.  But \\"Soldier of Love\\" is the best song on this album, and the most distinct, in lyrics, melody, production, and overall style.  Nothing else is like it, and the rest sorta blends into one dull, meandering, non-melodic blur.  I tried, I really did, to like it, to \\"hear\\" it, but after listening to it four times, I couldn't even hum you most of the tunes on this album.  And I say \\"tunes\\" advisedly.  I stare at the titles and I draw a blank.  What did that song sound like, I ask?  Oh, the production is impeccable, but to what end?  Sade's former soulful lover's rock, that smooth-but-substantial sound, has become an indistinct easy-listening background music, or even {shudder} elevator music.  Sorry, this was a big disappointment.

B002ZG9846|1.0|Kick Ass takes place in a world that appears to operate by the same laws of physics and probability as our own. The lead character asks his friends why no one has ever donned a superhero outfit to fight crime. His friends tell him that it's a crazy idea. The only man they can think of who tried something like that was a schizophrenic who fell to his death trying to fly.<br /><br />Later on, however, it becomes clear that the movie is taking place within a comic book. A little costumed girl (\\"Hit Girl\\") dodges bullets, takes out drug dealers with throwing knives, and goes toe-to-toe with an adult male. This could only happen in a comic book, or a movie based on one.<br /><br />At first the movie appears to be set in a reality where superheroes only exist in comic books. But when the Hit Girl character is introduced, it's almost as if the characters get sucked into a parallel universe. The costumed characters start pulling off improbable stunts and the storyline loses all touch with logical reality. This wheels within wheels narrative annoyed me, but it wasn't enough to make me hate the movie.<br /><br />What made me hate Kick Ass was the Hit Girl character. She cusses, she kills, she ventures into drug dens, all under the watchful eye of her father. This is supposed to be funny. The audience is supposed to laugh at this. Apparently, Hit Girl's gruesome antics are supposed to be a satire of something. If it's satire, it's satire so subtle that no one can explain it.<br /><br />When you criticize a movie like Kick Ass you're accused of \\"missing the point\\"; somehow, the vulgarity and crassness is the \\"point\\" of the movie, making it impossible to say anything negative about it. Of course, there's nothing satirical here.<br /><br />If you like Kick Ass, fine, but don't call it satire. Call it a guilty pleasure, call it mindless entertainment, call it a comic book movie, whatever. It can be all of those things, but it's definitely not satire. No one will watch this movie and think, \\"Wow, what a brilliant send-up of...\\"
B003405MF6|3.0|(Keep in mind that this reviewer is only a few years younger than the master, himself!)    First off, let me start by saying that I am a huge Jeff Beck fan, but my affection is not clouded by blind adoration.   After waiting 7 years to get something new from one of the best rock/electric guitarists on the planet, this album leaves me severely wanting.    First, the obligatory compliments: Jeff plays with a depth of sensitivity that very few others in this genre can aspire to.  His technique is simply jaw-dropping amazing.  He dynamically bends and twists notes so that they flow more like those of a bowed, rather than a plucked instrument.  This gives a lyrical quality to his playing that is nearly vocal in effect.    And, as always, his tone is immediately recognizable.  Jeff, as usual, uses his vast talent and tool box of skills very effectively on several of the tunes here, focusing on emotional content rather than technical pyrotechnics to communicate with his audience.    This \\"sparse\\" approach is, however, this album's greatest weakness since the majority of the songs here are really laid back, mellow, and, ultimately, forgettable.  There are a couple of upbeat tracks in the mix between the likes of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and \\"Serene\\" where he could have dug in and really boogied.    Unfortunately, just as he gets to the point where our ears expect to hear Jeff turn on the after-burner he pulls back.  Instead of a \\"kick a@@\\" pit bull on guitar we get a polite poodle.    Two tracks in particular follow this trend.  \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" is an un-inspired and altogether un-original vocal and instrumental arrangement.  This is a classic, bluesy song that has the potential to rip out your guts if done with real passion.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't come together for me.  Jeff's lead barely breaks a sweat and builds no tension and release in the listener.  Odd that it is so emotionally flat on an album intended to squeeze as much feeling as possible out of a song.The second song, \\"There's No Other Me\\", ends with Jeff playing a rocking finish but it fades out to silence just when he really starts to get aggressive and musically interesting.  Another couple of minutes of guitar soloing would have made the song much more memorable.  Yawn!    Lets face it, at just over 40 odd minutes there is plenty of room left to hold more.  Why he close to trim even the best tracks to only 3 or 4 minutes is hard to understand.  Surely Jeff, at this point in his career, can't be worried about getting top 30 air play (or maybe he is!).   If more of these tunes had been developed into full-fledged, soul satisfying masterpieces, this might have been another Grammy nominee for him and a winner for his listeners.    Bottom line is that if you are a fan, then you, of course, must own this album.  Otherwise, pick-up any of the many other Jeff Beck albums if you want to really hear why he is so highly praised.   When I'm in the mood for some really great guitar music I'll be choosing one of his older albums while \\"Emotion and Commotion\\" probably collects dust.

B00337KMAA|3.0|Even with all the Oscar hype for this movie I don't feel I went in with extremely high expectations, yet I was mostly underwhelmed with \\"Up In The Air.\\"<br /><br />First, I didn't feel the acting was all that great, especially by the leads. Much like Vince Vaughn, I never expect George Clooney to play anyone but George Clooney, and I'm OK with that. And, much like Vince Vaughn, that's going to work 95 percent of the time. But when a director is striving to relay a deeper meaning or explore complex feelings and issues, a guy basically playing himself and mugging for the camera just does not work. Vera Farmiga's role seemingly could have been played by anybody with blond hair (her character is a key character but the actress brings no depth), and Anna Kendrick's role also could have been filled by any actress. The best performances come from Amy Morton as Ryan's sister Kara, J.K. Simmons as one of the firees, Jason Bateman as the boss and even Danny McBride *NOT* hamming it up has a strong presence. Sadly, these roles are basically wasted.<br /><br />Second, Ryan's transformation is a major point in the movie, yet it feels like its forced or not quite complete. Even when he walks out on his backpack presentation, it feels (to me) that there is still a part of him still questioning the sedentary lifestyle he's avoided.<br /><br />Third, I never go for forced/easy love interests, but that's what this movie has and that love interest is one major element driving the film. I didn't find the Ryan-Alex relationship to be all that developed or believable.<br /><br />Also, the ending just seemed a bit off. An ending is just that -- a resolution to a plot or (in a movie like this that doesn't have much of a plot) a character's growth. Neither really happens, and though Ryan does have a bit of an epiphany (which is quickly crushed), the fact there is no reaction to it (that we see, anyway) and the realization that epiphany was bogus kind of makes the previous two hours a bit pointless. The viewer invests all this time and is left with very little to take home. The way I interpreted the ending left me questioning what good it was for Ryan to have his awakening.<br /><br />Last, there are some run-of-the mill complaints (opening credit music = awful, bland dialogue, the fact much of the movie was a commercial for Hertz, Chrysler and American Airlines) that helped tie the cement shoes to this one.<br /><br />I didn't think \\"Up In The Air\\" was awful, yet it struggled to live up to even modest expectations.intless.

B00004Z459|5.0|The sound of Hybrid Theory is different than any rock band had attempted with screaming and grungy vocals, rap sequences, and heavy electronic based melodies. The band all contributes to writing the music, and Mike Shinoda makes a great team with Chester Bennington as they continue to push each other to create stronger and deeper songs.    However, Mr. Hahn is the primary composer of their music besides the drums, electric guitar, and vocals for Linkin Park. He is what brings their incredibly unique sound. He is famous for using programming and synthesizers with sampling to create the melody and foot tapping sound of Linkin Park. Mr. Hahn uses a Korg Triton synthesizer keyboard as one of the main elements of his electronic work as well as an MS2000. The Triton was developed after the release of the Yamaha DX7, which was the first midi fm keyboard synth. The Triton has similar purposes and uses that were originally established with the DX7, that started the wave of 'preset' patches, so all synthesizers have the patch storing ability now, which goes to show the importance of this development by John Chowning. Mr Hahn was influenced by early computer music because he has mastered the Triton so well and uses it in every song on Hybrid Theory. He also goes back to earlier roots in computer music with the first analog syth, the Moog, which he utilizes in different pieces throughout this album.       Of course, In The End was the biggest hit from this album that is still found on rock radio stations 10 years later. The strength of the song is in the reverb that is created using computer synthesizers by Mr. Hahn. Although, this song is also one of the less electrically manipulated songs on this album, without the use of computer generation, the song would sound flat and empty.     Points of Authority- From the very beginning of the song, you here that sampling was being used to just record voices that were put into a phase vocoder. The vocals throughout the song were distorted and there are very clear synthetic  arrangements that hold the song.     Papercut- The echo used in this song to add emphasis to the vocalist is the strength of the song. In the middle of the song there is actually a point where the bridge is a completely computerized recorded voice that had been heavily manipulated.     With You and Crawling- Both of these songs do not begin with vocals and are heavily computer generated but incorporates an electric guitar. Once the vocals begin, they are still covered with phase vocoders and voice-overs. The sounds are random but not atonal when the song begins, and the first 30 seconds is 100% computer generated. With You was written with The Dust Brothers, who brought in the Moog synthesizer, and they coupled the Moog sound with guitar and live drum. The influence of the Moog is heavy on Linkin Park's sound because of different bands that have been an influence on their musical arrangements.     However, there are also songs like One Step Closer and Runaway, where there is definitely computer generated sounds but the song is more on the rock side with physical instruments like guitars. It is harder to see this song as \\"electronica\\" because of the intensity of the multiple instruments being used and this song does not rely on the computer like many of Linkin Park's songs that use the computer to carry the entire tune.     In By Myself, the vocals are never without computer manipulation, where there is strong echo, vibrato, distortion, and equalization. The part of the song that really stands out to the listener is the different sounds created with the vocalist and the computer generation. There is a sudden and strong build that is only created with sporadic computer noises.     Of course, Cure for the Itch is the complete electronica song on this album. It was fully composed by Mr. Hahn, Linkin Park's turntablist DJ, which contains strong computer generated rifts, electric drum sets,  and digital sampling. The song itself says that it's here to \\"teach a lesson in rhythm management\\" as a sampled voice recording is used in the first minute of the song. There are many complex layers, that really show the magnitude of Mr. Hahn's digital abilities. The mixture of electronic sounds with computer generated electronic acoustic melodies carry the song, which was completely created using electronic sources. It is the only song on this album that did not utilize any physical instruments.     This ability of Linkin Park to breach the mainstream style of heavy rock by incorporating such a strong amount of technosonic arrangements is an accomplishment. One the band began to distance itself from the electronic influence to become more acoustic, the sound and popularity of their album Minutes to Midnight dramatically decreased. This further shows the influence that the sound of the Moog synthesizer, electronic reverb, phase vocoders, and Mr. Hahn had on Linkin Park in Hybrid Theory. This is an amazing album!
B00005B2ZW|4.0|Great movie but I feel sorry for anyone who has to use the subtitles.  One of the best lines in the movie is botched by whoever was responsible for transcribing the dialog to text.  Peter, the foreigner who becomes an American Citizen in the course of the movie, tries to use an American idiom but gets it wrong.  Instead of saying that someone is going to \\"upset his apple cart\\", Peter calls it a \\"Wagon apple.\\"  A very humorous line.  Apparently, whoever was doing the subtitles did not get the joke and neither will anyone who relies on those subtitles.  In the subtitles, Peter's \\"wagon apple\\" has become, \\"bag of apples.\\"  If you love dialog in movies like this, leave the subtitles turned off.
B0035KGWR2|2.0|After her fresh and exciting folk-rock debut album portending a bright muscial future to come, this is a real disappointment.  It feels like Jim Steinman (of Meatloaf fame) meets Joan Baez -- the album is far over-produced and the vocals are lost in a wall of sound.  There are one or two memorable songs here, and the lyrics overall are simplistic; that would be OK if the songs were presented in a straightforward fashion, but the bombastic and overpowering music (with really annoying echo-effects throughout) underscores how trite many of the lyrics really are.    So, I suppose they'll make a lot of money, sell out a lot of stadiums, and maybe Amy 3 will be a little better.
B002VECMAE|1.0|What a waste of time.  I thought I would get a few good laughs from this movie and it put me to sleep.  It's a shame I can't return it for a refund.  A total waste of time and money.  I hate to even give it one star but I had to check one to submit the review.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|First of all, its a great movie.  I can call it a parable because of all the strong naming such as the precious ore \\"unobtainium\\".  That said, I cannot comprehend how people are complaining about the theatrical release at such a low price.  Its the cost of two movie tickets for pete's sake!  You want to wait till November to get the extended edition and not be able to see the movie now, at home?  Are you waiting till Christmas for some new restaurant to open and are avoiding any other place until then because you don't want to \\"waste your money\\"?  It's a wonderfully entertaining movie, it will have both BLURAY as well as DVD copies in the package, making the BLURAY version as cheap as the BLURAY version of HOME ALONE; and you complain?  Get the movie.  When the extended version comes out, give the old one to your kids, or your friends, or just use it as a deluxe and conversation-starting drink coaster.  Remember that the movie was about people who were not satisfied with what they had and wanted the more cost effective ore under the sacred tree, so try to be a little less selfish and just enjoy the movie.

B0034JKZ86|2.0|We let our 4 & 5 year old children watch this movie and were SO DISAPPOINTED! The obvious problem is that the princess/prince spend most of the movie as frogs, but that was no big deal.  However, it could have been a very cute movie and was not.  The worst part of this movie was the highly offensive \\"shadow man and his demons,\\" constant references to the dark side/demons as well as all the voodoo references that were not appropriate for young children.  I also didn't appreciate the New Orleans/LA stereotypes and I am not even from LA.  Our 4yo was scared.  With each evil scene, we assumed/hoped it was the last, but this theme continued through the entire movie.  We are accustomed to the \\"evil\\" plots of most Disney movies. There is always at least one evil character in each one. However, this movie takes it to the extreme.  This is a very disappointing Disney movie.  Don't waste your money. I only gave two stars for the animation. That was good....the rest awful.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|The days of synthpop have returned and are livelier than ever. La Roux, comprised of Elly Jackson (the one after which the band is named because of her red hair) and Ben Langmaid, is a musical duo that has taken influence from 1980s synthpop bands and created a fusion of synthesized beats and harmonized vocals. On their debut album La Roux (Bonus Track Version), Jackson is on the vocals while Langmaid stays behind the scenes taking part in the lyric writing and music production processes. Though it may appear to be more of a one-woman show in live performances, there is truly a group effort in creating their catchy tunes.<br /><br /> The album starts off with La Roux's second single, In For the Kill, whose quick tempo balances the layers of basic synth beats and melodies. The 1980s influence from bands such as Human League and Depeche Mode is obvious, as they were known for using beats created with FM Synthesis. However, the sound is modernized through adding more musical layers and a fairly constant underlying drum beats. It even shows-up the debut single, Quicksand, whose melodies are not as rich. However, Quicksand is still a good example of their use of multidimensional melodies in conjunction with harmonizing vocals. There are faint, yet distinct drum synths, along with varying beats that sound as if they have come from an early analog synthesizer and tin drums.<br /><br /> Bulletproof brings more of a dance-club vibe. This song sounds the most like a 1980s radio hit with a face lift. The melodies clearly take advantage of computer technology through the stereo effects. As well, with more FM computer algorithms available than in the 80s, they are able to create more detailed melodies and bring life to the song. They have taken the common arcade game sounding pop songs from earlier electronic music days and created a fun, fuller dance song.<br /><br /> The next few songs demonstrate the same abilities and 1980s influence; however, when Reflections are Protection comes through it is clear from the beginning that it is going to sound vastly different. The heavy bass beats create an electro-funk vibe that is unlike any other song on the album. However, there is less of a distraction as there are only three components: drum machine beats, synthesized bass melodies and synth beats from an electronic keyboard.<br /> The album is rounded out by Saviour, the bonus track, that combines Jackson's unaltered and distorted vocals, laying them over simple synth beats. It is a good choice for a bonus track because it introduces more synthesized bass beats and vocal distortion to create a wholesome, rich song. It is the second longest song on the album, but also one of the most basic lyrically. There is more of a focus on creating a solid musical combination between the tempo and pitch of the vocals (wether they are distorted or not) and the synthesized beats, rather than distinguishing the two.<br /><br /> Aside from bringing more life to the songs through layered and varied synth and drum machine beats, La Roux also uses psychoacoustic techniques to create surround sound effects which distinguishes their sound from other synthpop groups. In almost every song on the album there is at least one moment where it is used. It takes advantage of a key way to enhance a listener's experience and keep him or her enthralled.<br /><br /> La Roux filled their album with just under 50 minutes worth of flowing, creative and catchy songs. They show a range of electronic music that varies from highly 1980s influenced beats to electro-funk that blend perfectly with Elly Jackson's vocals. This musical duo is here to stay and can only produce more creative music in the future as they continue to experiment.<br /><br />Listen To: Tigerlilly, Cover my Eyes, Reflections are Protection and Growing Painslear from the beginning that it is going to sound vastly different.

B0030HG3KG|4.0|This is actually the first review i have ever written in 34 years. I'm doing it for two reasons: 1) I see there are no other reviews available for this collection and 2) The Pogues are my favorite (folk/rock/punk/irish/even bluegrass)group ever.  So here it is: First of all the presentation of the albums was a surprise to me, the vinyl replica is very nice ( I expected hard case)all thought it doesn't come with any type of booklet or additional information. The  first cd, Red Roses for Me is a little worn out on the mastering department, the bass is all over the place and sometimes there are ups and downs in the sound on some songs. This was a little bit dissapointing but then again these AREN'T the remastered series. Nevertheless from then on the albums are fantastic, the sound is great and well, so are the Pogues.  For any Pogues fan who doesn't own any (or not all) of these cd's this is really a great boxset, great music, great price.  P.S : If You really want to complete a Shane MacGowan collection I recommend \\"The best of the Pogues and \\"The Best of the Rest\\"\\"( They both have a couple of great songs from an E.P that's impossible to find), plus \\"The Rare Ol' Stuff\\" by the Popes.     Hope this helped,    Andres Sanchez  Bogota, Colombia
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|One of my pet peeves are soundtrack's where the order of songs is not in the chronological order as they appeared in the movie.  I usually come to amazon and find that someone has already posted a review and put songs in the proper order, but it looks like no one has done that thus far with this soundtrack.    The format I'll use for this is:    Proper Order # / Soundtrack Track # / Track Title / Appearance Time in Movie (H:MM:SS) / Comment (if any):  1 / 7 / Marital Sabotage / 0:28 / intro of movie as horses appear  2 / 9 / Ah, Putrefaction / ~14:00 / Partial Track used - played during 2nd half of dinner while Holme's tries observe details of Mary and fails miserably  3 / X / The Rocky Road to Dublin (Live) / 15:34 / By the Dubliners:  Not part of soundtrack - I bought this track separately and added it to my playlist.  4 / 4 / My Mind Rebels at Stagnation / / Multiple Ques:  Ride to Prison to speak to Blackwood, and Most prominent;y is @ 3:00 into the track, which is Blackwood's first (staged) execution  5 / 5 / Data, Data, Data / 28:00 / Irene Adler Theme - Played during multiple sections of the movie (crushing walnuts with her fist, and drugging Holmes at the Grand Hotel)  6 / 2 / Is It Poison, Nanny? / ~31:15 / Multiple Ques: @ 1:30 into track, it's the second half of Irene's Introduction conversation, and as she walks (non flashback) to meet with Moriarty  7 / 3 / I Never Woke Up in Handcuffs Before / 34:19 / Appears in multiple ques - flashback of following Irene, and during first fight with Dredger at Reardon's home.  8 / 10 / Panic, Shear Bloody Panic / ~1:15:00 / Inspection of Body, and sailing on the river to the Wharf  9 / 8 / Not in Blood, But In Bond / 1:24:10 / Wharf Explosions and aftermath  10 / 6 / He's Killed the Dog Again / ~1:30:00 into movie / played during Holme's \\"enhanced\\" re-enactment of the order's ceremonies  11 / 11 / Psychological Recovery. .. 6 Months /  / Basically the entire action sequence of the final act of the movie, and possiblysome of the music of the fight with dredger in the Drydock  12 / 1 / Discombobulate / 0:00 and 2:00:32 / Contains both the introduction notes of movie, followed immediately by ending credits) - I feel its more natural as the final track of the soundtrack  13 / 12 / Catatonic / ~2:05:00 / Played after 2nd playing of Rocky Road to Dublin during end of movie credits    I've left off the 2 tracks from \\"The Duchess\\" movie soundtrack that appear during the dinner scene at \\"The Royal\\".  I didn't particularly enjoy being shaken out of the distinct mood of the soundtrack when I included these two particular tracks in a playlist, but figured I should mention them here in case someone wants them for completeness sake.
B0037SQ3C6|4.0|I suppose that Chinese pianists become critic-proof once they reach stardom in China. If Yundi is called \\"the prince of the piano\\" in his native land, as the product description claims, then he has no obligation to satisfy  other tastes. The closest parallel would be Andrea Bocelli, whose forays into opera are cringe-worthy, a fact his record company can afford to flout.  But there's another side to Asian musicians, who realize that artistic quality is important and who strive to meet high standards of interpretation, not just technique. I think Yundi, like his contemporary Lang Lang, sincerely wants to sound genuine and idiomatic.<br /><br />In this first installment of the complete works of Chopin, a composer closely associated with his career, Yundi has taken on the Nocturnes, full well knowing that his predecessors include Rubinstein, Ohlsson, Pollini, Pires, and just a month or two ago, Nelson Freire. I loved Freire's set, which displayed a lifetime's experience with Chopin and a depth of mastery afforded to few pianists. By comparison, Yundi isn't exactly green. He has countless recitals under his belt. His playing is refined, elegant, circumspect, and reflective. He's never at a loss and never sounds clueless. One could wish for more drama and contrast as each Nocturne spins out sounding like the one before, but the real question is whether these nicely voiced but rather impersonal readings would have made it on to a major label if Yundi wasn't the \\"prince of the piano.\\"<br /><br />Who can really answer that? Yundi did win the International Chopin competition, which launched Pollini, Argerich, and more recently Rafal Blechacz, all sterling musicians. It has also launched pianists who went on to have lesser careers. At 25 years old, Yundi could head either way. If you define a career by concert dates and record sales, he's a shoo-in. But if a career is defined by artistry, he's a gifted young man whose promise is unfolding without a certain end in sight. For now, these are appealing performances with no real \\"face.\\"<br /><br />Note: If I were measuring this set of Nocturnes against the best, it would receive three stars, but four seemed right in terms of Yundi's career so far.ppealing performances with no real \\"face.\\"    Note: If I were measuring this set of Nocturnes against the best, it would receive three stars, but four seemed right in terms of Yundi's career so far.

Don' pass this up, buy it.
B001FB5634|4.0|This movie is based on a very good book. The movie does a good, but not great job of capturing the spirit of the book. McCarthy's book is well written and gripping. The book, however, is not able to catch the velvety texture of the book because it simply a three dimensional representation of the book. That said, the movie does offer a great representation of a very important question. The question is: \\"What would you be willing to do for your soon?\\" Would you be willing to kill your soon to prevent him from being cannibalized and eaten? Maybe not, but the main character in this movie is forced to consider that very question throughout the entire movie. In the process, we are offered a seat from which to watch while he wrestles with this decision. Get this movie and watch the painful decision he must confront, and be thankful you will never be faced with such a decision.

B002JODUI4|5.0|Deadmau5, pronounced like \\"dead mouse,\\" is the pseudonym for Joel Zimmerman, an electronic house producer. The name deadmau5 comes from the name of his web developing business, which he named after a dead mouse he found in his computer one day. The reasoning for the numeric spelling at the end is so that it could function as a username for online interfaces. Zimmerman, a 29 year old Canadian from Toronto, has worked his way up the ladder in the music industry. His album \\"Random Album Title,\\" debuted electronically in September 2008, and copies were released soon after in November.  Deadmau5 is best known for some of its collaborative works with Kaskade, Rob Swire and Steve Duda. \\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" was out on September 22, 2009. This album contained some huge hits such as \\"Moar Ghosts N' Stuff\\" which was aired during the Winter Olympic Games and on MTV's \\"America's Best Dance Crew.\\"         As a child, Zimmerman was obsessed with computers and technology, now as an older music producer, he still exemplifies his love of technology through his work. Along with Steve Duda, Zimmerman creates music software which he uses in his own shows. Between 2006 and 2007, he worked for the company behind the Fruity Loops virtual studio programme, also known as \\"FL Studio.\\" This program is very similar to the programs we use in our class everyday such as Garage Band. In 2008, another group called Dirty Circuit got in legal trouble for using a sample that came with the program FL Studio called \\"LP_Faxing Berlin C_128 bpm\\" due to the fact that Deadmau5 had copyright of this material.         Zimmerman approaches music in a whole new way. As a result, he loathes the title \\"DJ.\\" He considers it an outdated way of referring to the art he produces. He assembles tracks as he goes, using the latest computer technology some of which he has created himself. When performing \\"it's a technological orgy up there and I try to keep it more my music than anyone else's,\\" he says.  Also,the costume Zimmerman takes on during performances is that of an oversized mouse head, with large eyes that blink to the enthralling beat of the music. This, too, is introducing a new theatrical, entertainment concept to the dance music industry that it was lacking before.          Being on the brink of the technological revolution, Zimmerman tried to convince recording studios to embrace the changing times and to incorporate PC's into the production of music. Many turned down his ideas, while a small recording studio in Toronto finally gave in. The revolutionary types of technology that are integrated into the work of Deadmau5 have led to some of the hits off of the album \\"For Lack of a Better Name.\\"         One of the songs on the album is \\"Soma.\\" Soma refers both to a muscle relaxant as well as a leafless East Indian vine which has a sour milky juice formerly used to make an intoxicating drink. The song begins with one of Deadmau5's typical repeating drum loops, quick paced. Midway through the song, the beats begin to blur, reverberate and slow down as though the drug is kicking in, seeping into the veins.  It continues like this and all of a sudden the beat kicks back up again. Then once again, near the end, the beat explodes into a cloud of static, resulting back into the dreamlike sound sequence. The song lingers, picking up the pace with a pouncing drum beat, and finally fades off.          The song \\"Strobe\\" has a very ambient feel. The background sounds are very similar to the ambient cloud spaces we made a few weeks ago in class. This song starts off slow and cloud like and then around 3:30-3:50 picks up the speed, increasing from 80-90 bpm's to as much as 125 bpm's without interrupting the flow of the song whatsoever. These transitions are done so very elegantly that we are almost immune to the drastic changes that are happening right before us as we listen to this song.         \\"For Lack of a Better Name,\\" is one heck of an album, with many more songs toexplore. I chose to listen to and analyze \\"Soma\\" and \\"Strobe.\\" The \\"16th Hour,\\" \\"Ghosts N' Stuff\\" and \\"Moar Ghosts N' Stuff\\" are just several other songs on the album that are sure to intrigue you. Give them a listen and you'll see what I mean. The auditory and melodic artistry that goes into these songs are outstanding and something everyone should definitely experience!
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Ok, ok, ok, this movie may not contain the most innovative plot. Heck, it might not even be that original. What this movie does, does and very, very well, is portray the feelings of the main character. This character is a lonely miner stuck on the moon. A man without any human interaction and working under a false assumption that he is himself. Through the movie he finds that what he thought was true is a lie, and then must deal with the emotional fallout of this realization. This is what this movie portrays so, so very well. So well, in fact, that you will feel his suffering and anger. Get this movie and see emotions on display with little being held back.
B00004XPPB|3.0|\\"Donnie Brasco\\" is a movie based on a real life autobiography describing an FBI agent's undercover life in the Mafia and a criminal partnership that also develops int a deep friendship.  Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI mole who poses as a jewel broker named Donnie Brasco.  He is granted entrance into the violent mob family of Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino).  Lefty  becomes his mentor, showing deep trust in the man he knows as Donnie.  When Joe's (known as Donnie Brasco) personal and professional lives collide, his mission is at risk. Joe sees gray areas between his ties to the underworld and the law.  With divided loyalties, he risks his life, his marriage, his job and Lefty, the mentor that becomes his friend.<br /><br />Depp and Pacino, as well as the supporting cast of Anne Heche, Bruno Kirby, Michael Madsen and James Russo show extraordinary acting, and give compelling character studies to this gritty undercover criminal story.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This film is being released on DVD on Tuesday, April 20th.<br /><br />\\"The Young Victoria\\" was directed by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e and written by Julian Fellowes. It stars Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) as young Princess Victoria and Rupert Friend as Prince Albert. The movie covers the Queen's upbringing and ascension into power and enduring romance with her future husband, Prince Albert.<br /><br />Victoria's childhood begins with the Kensington system, a strict and elaborate set of rules developed by her mother, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her attendant and supposed lover, Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) deemed to keep the Princess safe since she was the heiress presumptive by having others taste her food and always having to be accompanied down a flight of stairs with someone holding her hand. Victoria resented her mother and Conroy for attempting relentlessly to make her sign a Regency agreement giving them power in case something happened to her. She also had to sleep in a room with her mother until her eighteenth birthday and after becoming Queen, one of her first orders was that her bed be moved to another room. For their treatment of Victoria, after she became Queen she banished them to a far corner of the palace and often refused to see them. Throughout the film, Victoria has to learn how to take up the reigns and relies heavily on adviser Lord Melbourne played by Paul Bettany. Her biggest challenges prove to be balancing her decisions based on his opinions, her own, and her soon-to-be husband.<br /><br />Emily Blunt is very lovely as Victoria, very restrained and fiery and then totally sweet when she uses the \\"wittle\\" voice to talk to her cute dog, Dash. She always holds her head up high and rarely smiles in public. She is fantastic at appearing strong with her heavy burdens, but also with showing her vulnerabilities privately. She does a wonderful job acting in this film, particularly with the very proper gradual love story that blossoms with Rupert Friend's Prince Albert. Getting to be a leading lady in a period piece like this is a huge opportunity for Blunt to shine and she succeeds.<br /><br />Friend is adorable and charming and Albert's devotion to Victoria is very endearing. Others in power set Albert into motion to get into Victoria's bed but as soon as he finally secures her affections, he casts the others adrift and chooses to make his own decisions which is wonderfully fresh in comparison to other \\"royal\\" stories in films where suitors try to get close to the Queen to use and abuse her powers. Victoria wisely puts off marriage for quite some time while she learns her new duties, not wanting the distraction or temptation of others to use her. Both characters genuinely love each other and it is a sweet story of the two together.<br /><br />Paul Bettany is quite the smooth talker as Lord Melbourne. Even though others find his almost courting of Victoria to be solicitous, he always finds a way to be honest and caring towards her and morally forward. Even though he seems jealous of the attention she pays to Albert, he tries to keep what is best for her front and center. Jim Broadbent plays the very outspoken King William, uncle to Victoria who proclaims before a crowded party that he planned to live at least long enough for Victoria to turn eighteen so Regency could not take effect and his power would transfer directly to her.<br /><br />Not knowing a great deal about the history of Victoria and after researching it vigorously on Wikipedia to get up to date, this movie really does cover the amount of time pretty accurately. As far as I could tell, one significant event was changed slightly for drama and love story, but the rest seems to play out as it did keeping in the most developmental details: her mother and Conroy's actions, Melbourne's distinct influence, Albert's courtship, the parliament, and of course her King Charles dog, Dash.<br /><br />This movie was first released theatricallyin Europe in the spring of 2009 before going through six U.S. Film Festivals and eventually in limited release this past December. This film really should have received more popular attention outside of winning the Best Costume Oscar because it really is a treat visually with fantastic writing and acting as well.

0340898917|5.0|Through years of my life I have been searching for ways to get closer to the \\"one and ultimate\\" spiritual truth. While there are such gems as Tao and other ancient spiritual teachings and texts, they are often hard to decipher and understand for a modern man/woman. Well, one no longer has to - thanks to The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. He saw through the accumulated debris of human intellectualization of the Sacred, and had a direct experience with what some call GOD, or Source - or whatever you wish to name the higher aspect of Consciousness that all of us come from. He uses simple and easy to understand language (he has a true gift of word) to explain to us that most sacred and significant, that has been hidden from humanity for centuries (except for the select lucky few who, through lifetimes of devotion, were able to get the glimpses of it).     You want to know this \\"one and ultimate truth\\" too? You want to not just know it at the intellectual level but also make it a part of your every day and every moment of life? You want to have simple and practical methods that can make your higher spiritual self accessible to you today? Well, this is your book then. I would say that this is the most amazing book that I have ever held in my hands.

0440243688|5.0|Gone Tomorrow is a highly entertaining book.  It has a gripping plot that pulls you in right from the first scene, which takes place on a New York City subway train.  The hero, Jack Reacher, hops on a train late at night (actually very early in the morning) and spots a woman who is exhibiting all of the traits of a suicide bomber.  Reacher recognizes this because he is a former military cop.  He confronts her and the action takes off like a jet from there, ending several hundred pages later with Reacher fighting off  a group of terrorists in an abandoned apartment on New York's upper east side.<br /><br />Along the way Reacher travels to Washington, DC to confront a senatorial candidate, is imprisoned on several occasions by several different adversaries, gets drugged, mugged and kidnapped, and finds himself homeless on a city street trying to fight off an armed thug while wearing a pair of plastic garden clogs.  The Reacher character is both brilliant and hilarious, and Child manages to write about him in a way that makes him entirely believable.<br /><br />This is the first Reacher novel that I've read, but it won't be my last.
0385342039|4.0|I applaud Sophie Kinsella for trying something different - combining a love story with a bit of the supernatural.  Thanks to her deft writing style, it works better than it sounds.  The net result is a light read that feels good,  despite being a bit implausible.
B000059MEK|5.0|What better showcase of technosonic music than Daft Punk's album, Discovery. Each song brings a different collection of beats and textures that automatically get you off your seat and never leave you bored. Although I do admit the lyrics are barely impressive, the intricacy and attention to the electronic music and its overall composition makes up for it. Overall, the songs in this album include a wide array of nicely-done electronic sounds and addictive technosonic beats that keep the listener wanting more.    As the beginning of Crescendolls plays, all I can think about is the Jewish rapper SoCalled playing on his sampler in front of my music class. Percussive beats are recorded, samples are taken, and buttons are pushed to come up with a brilliant concoction of techno sounds. I can't help but think that a similar method was used in composing this song. One layer is added to another until a good composition results, while the sample \\"HEY\\" and \\"everybody y'all\\" adds an extra variant to the piece. The repetition, although it should be obnoxious at thought, is nothing but catchy.    Aerodynamic is another song that does the album well. The only thing that I don't particularly like and that confuses me is the church bells gonging, which makes me anticipate monks chanting. Besides that, there are so many elements in the song that deserve recognition. Once the beat picks up, the panning from left to right with the synthesizer automatically and easily lets me forgive the awkward beginning. More surprising is the bridge in the middle, when the modern song full of synths and computer music takes it back to the earlier days of technosonic music by playing an instrument whose sound very much resembles that of the Hammond organ. Interesting sounds to put together, but somehow they work well.    The last song I'd like to touch on in this album is One More Time. This is probably one of the more popularly played songs, loved by both young and old for good reason. From the upbeattempo to the feel-good lyrics, this song is definitely one for the ages. Listening closely, the FM synthesizer is clearly put to good use in this track. Starting with a fast tempo, then slowing it down towards the middle only brings the energy to a higher level as the beats pick up again. From a historical perspective, this ambient feel halfway through the song is very reminiscent of John Chowning's Stria, which was one of the first songs to be made using the FM synthesizer. Even in the beginning, it seems like a phase vocoder was used to remove some of the frequencies in the sound. Variations like these that Daft Punk brilliantly places in their pieces help bring their compositions to higher levels.    As an album altogether, Discovery is the ultimate dance party playlist. Each song has its own catchy words and the technosonic sounds implemented by the synthesizers provides the perfect ensemble of sounds to get you up and moving. Even the vocoding on the voices gives the album another element to applause. Overall, I admire Daft Punk for their brilliant understanding of beat composition and electronic sound variations.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Great movie about growing up. Ellen Page is outstanding in the part of Juno. Would highly recommend this movie, with the exception of viewing with younger children, due to the main topic being teen pregnancy.
0618918248|2.0|I find Richard Dawkins rather \\"egoistic\\" in his claims that religions are all faulty and are political tools, a method of brainwash, etc.  However having said this, it doesn't imply that I am affiliated with any religion.<br /><br />He mentioned that the aim of his book is to have religious reader become an atheist when they put down the book.  I feel that he makes himself somehow a \\"missionary religion enemy\\" And in itself he created a new religion - the atheist!<br /><br />I think Dawkins should read Eckhart Tolle, one of the \\"three trinity of atheist\\" as quoted by some (together with the author of \\"God is not great\\") and learn to keep his gargantuan ego under control.<br /><br />Sorry to be a harsh on the reader, but I guess in today's world basic etiquette and politeness in speeches, even though in situation where \\"assertiveness\\" is necessary, should be given high importance.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This is the first six Star Trek movies presented as they were in the movie theater. No director's cuts. Each disc comes in a slim dvd enclosure and the main box that encased them is fairly attractive. The discs themselves come with little 'Star Trek Academy' featurettes that discuss things like the Genesis device, the Whale Probe and Shakespeare in Klingon that were fun to watch. The seventh disk is all bonus material.<br /><br />When I read the reviews of this collection I started becoming all confused and turned around by all the Blu Ray talk. Despite what people have said in their reviews, these are standard dvd format, not Blu Ray. Why folks felt compelled to post Blu Ray reviews here, rather than on the ST Blu Ray product I don't understand. You do not need a Blu Ray player to watch these discs. I wanted to make that clear because it's easy to get confused the more reviews here you read. Lot of folks downrated this product seemingly because they couldn't be bothered to read the product description carefully before hitting the buy button.<br /><br />I am not tech savvy enough to talk about whatever treatments these films received but the movies all look and sound very good on a humble non HD tv. Altogether I am very happy with this purchase.
0307454541|5.0|This was a book that I already knew was great since I am from Sweden and everybody over there talked about it.  Finally, I decided to pick it up and it is as good as everybody says!  I have already moved on and read the second book in the Millenium Trilogy...fantastic!  Next!

0143038419|5.0|I'm a cancerian female reader who finds this book a deep resonant to my heart!  The way she writes, how Liz comments on food, how she puts on weight, love her man and is ready to sacrifice all.. All so similar to all cancerian women :-)<br /><br />I have never enjoyed reading a memoir as much as this one.  I couldn't put the book down and keep wondering what would happen next in Liz's adventure in the three country.  I think she has also done a really good pre-marketing job for her next book \\"Committed\\"<br /><br />Wonderful and a very jolly book!
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Spoiler<br /><br />I have a love-hate relationship with this book.  My reasoning?  It is hard to convince me that Savannah, who supposedly loved this man with her entire being and was willing to wait for him, falls in love with someone else entirely.  Within a year.  Even in the end it is positively clear who she truly loves.  Yet, she marries this other guy.  Completely not fair to either of the men involved.  This makes her seem shallow, and more in love with the idea of marriage than being with the one she loves.  Very disappointing.  Definitely keeps you reading to the last page, wondering if something will change.  And it even leaves you almost HOPING for someone to die of cancer (which is morbid) or hoping for an affair, which is also very wrong.  So, this book brought so many conflicting emotions that felt so wrong in this whole book.  And you never get to see the guy move on.  It seems as if he will always look at Savannah's life through a window, and never enjoy one of his own.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY KINDLE REVIEW<br />What happened to being able to purchase a book for my Kindle for the fraction of the cost of the original?  I went to SAMS CLUB and bought this book for a little over four dollars instead of buying it here for over eleven dollars (which was the cost when I went to purchase this.)  Highly disappointing, considering this was one of the major perks for purchasing my Kindle.  If they are price gauging because of the popularity of the kindle or the book, then it is a shame they have taken this route.  I hope they remember that it was US who made the kindle popular by telling our friends and purchasing their books.  If they continue raising the price, however, I will just go to the book store and opt for buying a hard copy.
B002VECMAO|1.0|I should have taken the previous reviews to heart. I thought it was impossible to be so bad, with all the talent in this movie. Trust me, it's worse than you think! WASTE OF MONEY!!!! (and time)
B002VPE1B6|3.0|Just wanted to say that I came back from department store and they already have the DVD and Blu-ray of the movie for sale, but it is pretty bare bones package it is cool as the quality of the image is amazing on HD but it should be good enough for people that missed it in the theaters.    I picked it up as a present for my girlfriend and as an excuse to watch it until I get the 3D release version coming later. You can do that if you want to wait but also can't wait to see it.

0756405890|5.0|I cannot really describe how amazing Patrick Rothfuss' writing style is. His word choice alone is reason to read this book. The story is amazing as well, but if I watched it as a movie, it wouldn't have the same effect. (Maybe if it was narrated by Morgan Freeman.) I have read countless fantasy novels and this is hand over fist the best one I have read. I say it's better than Tolkien simply because I have grown up with Tolkien and take him for granted. The Kingkiller Chronicles can easily be my generation's LOTR.
0930289234|4.0|The Watchmen is firmly rooted in Cold War paranoia - one of the central themes of the story is the threat of nuclear holocaust that hovers over everything the characters do.  As superheroes, most of these characters are not in a position to ultimately affect the fate of the human race, and this leads to frustration or apathy, and eventual alienation from the rest of humanity.  The Cold War setting could have made the story very dated, but because of the structure of the story (it's like a Tarantino film, jumping around in time and using multiple storytelling techniques), we are readily and easily drawn into the world and everything seems current.<br /><br />The plot, in very basic terms is this: the original generation of superheroes have retired.  They were costumed do-gooders but otherwise normal human beings who tried to help people by patrolling the streets for muggers, rapists, and gangsters.  The second generation became increasingly sopisticated in their crimefighting techniques (and fought in Vietnam), but were ultimately outlawed as vigilantes and had to hang up their costumes.  The Comedian, a superhero that was absorbed as a government (CIA) agent is murdered.  The outlaw superhero Rorschach (still practising but wanted by the police) investigates the murder.  Early chapters focus on the histories and interconnections between the (former) superheroes, and lead up to the point where some of them come out of retirement, convinced of the need to start working again to solve the puzzle of Comedian's death.<br /><br />Such a plot description does not do justice to the depth of the story, nor does it adequately explain Watchmen as a cultural phenomenon.  Indeed, the modern reader (say, 20 years old and younger) might not recognize the revolutionary nature of this novel, because so much of it has been incorporated into the mainstream.  Any reader is likely to find it engrossing, if not strictly speaking \\"entertaining\\".  In fact, the drawback (for which I've deducted a star in its rating) is that this graphic novel is so consistently depressing and irredeemably violent that it's hard to read at a sitting.  As a monthly publication it would have worked better.  Collected into one volume like this is almost too much (although the reader can, of course, parcel out chapters as a slow pace if desired).<br /><br />It's easier to admire the Watchmen than it is to like it.  Many people put it at the top of their list of favourite graphic novels.  I'm still more partial to the Frank Miller Batman stories than anything by Alan Moore, but there's no doubt that Watchmen is, and will continue to be, a touchstone in the world of graphic novels.
0375826742|4.0|So yah it may not have been his best book but hey, all you people out there bashing it, lay off. People say that the sixth harry potter wasen't great but jk rowling had to wrap up all the lose ends and the sixth was the rap up book so it seems like it wasen't so focused on entertainment. This is what Brisingir is, the wrap up book. The next one is last book and will be so much better. And I can't deny that the middle of the book wasen't a bit dry and that I wished something more had happened between Eragon and Arya but hey cut him some slack and he's really young for writing such a huge book.

B0000009RT|5.0|There are certain special albums that, when listened to carefully and wholly, can introduce you to new worlds of sound, concepts, and ideas. There are a good number of these records that I've encountered, and this is one of them. (Some others? [[ASIN:B00000J7SS Bitches Brew]], [[ASIN:B000003TAL Daydream Nation]], [[ASIN:B000005JA8 Trout Mask Replica]], and [[ASIN:B000AA4LSM Hex: Or Printing in the Infernal Method]].) A lot of these records will also strike you with a kind of dumbfounded \\"what IS this?\\" confusion. Again, this record is in this group. When I first heard this record at 17, listening to it took me into a kind of uncomfortable but strangely pleasant universe. Ugly but painfully catchy songs morphing through a mix of rock, musique concrete, doo-wop, r&b and several other varied styles for the majority of the record, before brutally mutating into a confusing, scary and disorienting collage of bizarre effects, sounds, musical ideas, and voices. Needless to say, my musical soul was forever scarred in the most pleasant way. This may be Mr. Zappa's finest collection of succinct pop songs; they burn themselves into your brain and the musical performances by the Mothers render them with enough verve and detail to come back again and again. Speaking of Zappa's songwriting, I noticed something a little odd while listening to this album for the hundredth time; some of these songs can be pretty emotionally affecting! (At least for Zappa.) No one would ever accuse Zappa of being a sappy songwriter, and he would probably hate to hear it, but it's true; songs like \\"Go Cry on Somebody Else's Shoulder\\", \\"How Could I Be Such a Fool?\\", and \\"You Didn't Try to Call Me\\" are very pretty, sensitively composed pop songs. I read somewhere that Zappa wrote some of these tunes after his divorce with his first wife, so I know that some element of these songs aren't just satire; besides, his adeptness at working within the genres show a genuine affection for them. It's just that thesongs are interpreted by a flat-voiced, goofy  group of subpar musicians (not a negative criticism). Musically, you can see some of the Zappa hallmarks beginning to blossom: his eventual epic improvisatory excursions on electric guitar are foreshadowed by some stinging, effective but concise licks pounded out in songs like \\"Hungry Freaks, Daddy\\"; his clever use of harmony and deployment of instruments and playing to voice his compositions; and his off-beat, surreal sense of art, aesthetic and humor. It's too bad that Zappa didn't do more records with this group, as their amateurishness and sloppy charisma balanced out some of his musical pomposity. By 1970, the group that created this world of its own would be disintegrated.
0349113912|4.0|It's difficult to critique [[ASIN:0349113912 Me Talk Pretty One Day]] having just read [[ASIN:0316154687 When You Are Engulfed in Flames]]. No doubt, most who like one Sedaris work will also enjoy the other. In a series of short essays, the author recalls humorous people and situations from earlier in his life. Both start in childhood, which of course has the ripest material, including some gems on speech therapy and his father. That nothing is entirely autobiographical is evident from Sedaris contradicting himself from one story to the next. Did he go to college on the East coast or the Midwest? Did he graduate or not? These are not important questions. Plot serves only as a means to get the reader to laugh. Like the show Seinfeld, [[ASIN:0349113912 Me Talk Pretty One Day]] is also about nothing.<br /><br />  There was the occasional dud, for me the chapter titled \\"I almost saw a girl get killed\\" fell flat. But much more often the reader is entreated to a genuinely funny, oft-entertaining book that can be read over a month just as easily as in a day. Although I prefer his more recent work, the author continues to show that a masterful interplay of wit and style need not concern itself with run-of-the-mill content.
1847396240|4.0|This book is though provoking but disturbing as the very full life of a woman begins to slowly unravel and there's nothing anybody can do including the reader except stand on the edge of this dreadful abyss and feel helpless.    Alzheimer's runs in my family and because I am not so far from Alice's age and I have my bouts of senior moments, I continue to think about this book and have had periodic nightmares of my own demise into dementia.   I found her husband's character to be selfish and perhaps in my naivety, found it sad to believe this is how a loving spouse would respond in this situation.  Since reading the book, I have become paranoid of symptoms and am planning a full physical this summer complete with genetic testing for the DNA markers related to Alzheimer's.  I commend the author for framing this depressing subject within the context of a very relatable woman.

0061719544|4.0|I usually don't read many autobiographies of Hollywood types, they're usually not all that interesting really.    Ferguson's is different.    When you find yourself engrossed in the story of a drunken, drugged-out loutish Scots bum who's clearly going down in flames, there's something there.  In this case it's a strangely uplifting story of a kid from the Scottish equivalent of an inner-city housing project who makes good in America, and makes good in life.    Ferguson says that Americans prepare for glory by failing until we don't.  He certainly failed often enough....until he didn't.    And in so doing became just what America wants in a new citizen.  Someone who understands, often better than native born Americans, just what America is and offers.  In America, unlike anywhere else on earth, Ferguson got his second chance, and his third and his 106th.  America is a land where failure isn't permanent and only here could a former punk rocker drunk with no prospects become truly one of us and a success.    The trip is rocky with some less than flattering episodes from which Ferguson doesn't spare himself, but through it all he kept looking for an elusive something he finally found here and in doing, found himself.    Behold, a new American
B002HYHZ9Q|5.0|I loved the movie, however, my eyes didn't like the 3-D effect. After the movie ended, it took my eyes about an hour to return to normal.    I watched it in 2-D and it was absolutely super!    A quality, clean, fun family movie!
B00005JKZV|4.0|\\"The Two Towers\\" is the inevitable sequel to Peter Jackson's dramatization of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\".<br /><br />The epic battle at Helm's Deep is the climax of the movie, but the real superstar is Gollum. Talk about being worth waiting for! The nasty and unpredictable creature was only momentarily included in the trailer, since Jackson just knew it would bring the house down anyway. Which, of course, it did. The inner struggle between the evil Gollum and the good-hearted but confused Sm&eacute;agol is a real classic. Is anybody surprised that the evil side eventually wins? Still, Gollum is to be pitied rather than hated. To him, the ring is like a narcotic. That too is nicely captured.<br /><br />That being said, the weaknesses of Tolkien's LOTR trilogy also shines through at various points. The characters lack depth. There is no real tension between Aragorn and Eowyn, or even between Aragorn and Arwen. Faramir is extremely boring, and the tension between him and his father is somehow missing, too. Ironically, the only figure that undergoes some kind of character development is Gollum, which may be one of the things that make him so interesting!<br /><br />Another problem is that Tolkien couldn't make up his mind whether LOTR should be a children's story or a fantasy epic for adults. \\"The Two Towers\\" is mostly the latter, but the childish aspect comes across in the subplot involving the Ents, giant talking trees spouting beards and very slow minds. I know that the Entish attack on Isengard is supposed to be some kind of symbolic \\"revenge of nature\\", but the whole thing nevertheless strikes me as quite ridiculous. Jackson probably didn't dare excise the Ents from the plot, but he should have!<br /><br />There is also one problem which will bug Tolkien fans - the only actor with a reasonably correct elvish pronunciation is Christopher Lee (Saruman). The others pronounce \\"Sauron\\", \\"Mordor\\", \\"Sm&eacute;agol\\" and \\"D&eacute;agol\\" in English rather than in Tolkienesque...<br /><br />I'm not a great fan of the LOTR universe, but, yes, I did notice!<br /><br />That being said, \\"The Two Towers\\" is nevertheless worth watching.

0393072231|3.0|The beginning and end of the book are little sermons that have little to do with the story and seem like they are thrown in to advance Lewis's agenda. And the meaty part of the book is not really written so much as joined together with extensive quotations. Yes, Lewis should be praised for the thoroughness of getting the 3,572 quotes, but that is crediting the act of research and not necessarily the final product. The character sketches are weak, and other than Dr. Burry don't make me feel much for them.    I can't help thinking that the main characters in the book were explicitly selfish in their motives, but Lewis continually focuses the negative aspects of the characters on the \\"other guys\\". It's almost like being smart and selfish is better than dumb and selfish. There is not much hint that, even though some of the \\"shorters\\" were calling the events a potential Armageddon, they did nothing to notify someone who might listen. I won't call it greedy necessarily because I think that term is used way too often (just about everyone tries to maximize their earnings in one way or another and finance/business guys have more chances to do so). But it seems that pretty early on in the mess, flags could have been raised concerning the situation.     But the content of the book was very interesting. I had just finished The Housing Boom and Bust by Sowell which gives a much larger economic picture but without much detail of the mortgage bond mess. So this book is an excellent follow-up to it.    Let's be clear, the housing bust would have occurred without \\"The Big Short\\" ever occurring. The big players like Goldman Sacks, AIG, and others were dealing with risks they didn't understand, but those risks would have been there for John Q. Public without the big Wall Street banks. The housing bust was due to a mass of over extended credit lines, lies on applications, a complete lack of capital reserves, viral loan origination, too low interest Rates, government coercion of increased lending, false loan guarantees by the Feds through Fannie and Freddie, etc. The failure of the investment banks was due to their mismanagement of the risk associated to those bad loans. Some in the media try to confuse the viewer/reader that the investment banks are guilty of being involved in parts of the larger financial meltdown that they were not. People calling for Goldman's neck need to remember that without the true causes of the housing bust, Goldman couldn't have caused the later problems even if they had tried.    I'm tired and I'm sure this is a lousy review. My apologies in advance.
031606792X|4.0|I swore I would not read the twilight series, but I got curious after seeing the movie. As a fiction writer currently in an MFA program, I am always drawn to what the masses love.  I have to admit, I love the books as much of the world does.  And I love the last one as well, Breaking Dawn. I wasn't sure why, the first time I read it, I did love it, why my heart was beating so fast and a knot was in my throat through all 700 pages in a 36 hour block of time. I was bewildered and stunned by the directions the book took. I felt we had taken off from one land and landed in a new a totally unfamiliar world.  I had to re-read the book, it was nagging me. How did things spin out so wildly? How did we get from Forks high school to half-blood babies and epic impending battles? Was this what I wanted to happen? This was the biggest question. And the answer, after reading the first time, was \\"NO\\". But I could stop thinking about the book. Out of all of them, this one haunted me.  So I went back to page #1 and started over again, reading a bit slower with my writer's eye turned on this time.   The YA world is my area when it comes to scholarship.   My conclusion is: The book is not perfect--what book is-- but it is what it needed to be.  This whole series, to me, is about Bella's journey to realizing her power. She has little worth at the beginning, and I mean that she perceives herself as having little worth.  But there are many element of the lacking of worth that come out in the actions of the other characters. Bella is clumsy, invites trouble, the main goal of everyone around her is to protect her from everything. But we get to really see Bella grow and change, or at least finally assume the role she was always meant to play, that of power, that of strength. In the end Bella is the only one that can protect her family, all of them. She is what she was always intended to be.    Bella could never have been portrayed as a typical newborn; she was never for one moment a typicalhuman. If she had come out the other side as a blood-thirsty uncontrollable newborn, then that would not have been true to what the story is about--again Bella coming into her own--. This last book has to be looked at as the last ¼ of the whole story. This is where payoffs come into play. Bella earned this outcome by being who she is.   The baby story line has merit too. First, it's steeped in real myth and lore. Second, it the exact opposite thing expected. We and all the characters expect that a human and a vampire, first of all, cannot have sex, and we get the exact opposite of that. I agree, I wanted to have more of the Sex when Sex was happening, I've read many ,many YA's where Sex is rendered satisfactory.  But it is a thrill, a payoff, that they can have sex. One that Bella and Edward had to work on for a very, very long time.   Them having sex seals Bella's fate, finally. The human world is not an option to return to. When Bella and Edward have sex, Bella crosses the threshold into a new world with new rules. The baby is not part of the human world that Bella no longer lives in. Though she is still human, she has made her choices and so the new more fantastical rules apply. A baby can come to be in this new world we have transitioned into. It breaks no rules. I was disturbed at first by this development, but I can understand it now. There is a complex web being established here where the two worlds are being messed together. There is reason for the baby, all along Meyer has dropped hints that there is nothing really magical about the Cullen's; they are just another species with DNA. The baby works on many levels, the divide between human and \\"vampire\\" is not as gaping as thought. I tend to enjoy the breaking down of the old trite beliefs that Vampires are soulless and damned. By the end of the fourth book, I feel a new kind of magic about who these people are. It's a breath of fresh air.   Yes, it wraps up happy, and that is an indulgence in a way. But I would have had a hard time if things ended badly. I have suffered enough and am fine with a guilty pleasure of knowing things are happy at the end. Most of all, I am pleased that Bella is a powerhouse and her change from beginning to end is so strong.   When we love something so much, it can be hard to see the good when the end comes. I think this book deserves more credit and a second read with some thought on the series as a whole.    I plead for more attention to be paid on the writing, but the story is the most important part and that is what counts in the long run.    Please finish \\"Midnight Sun\\" it has a place in this saga.

031606792X|1.0|A whole lot of nothing ... 700 plus pages of redundant banter. I have read all 4 books and the first book \\"Twilight\\" was interesting and the subsequent books fell downward from that point on. If an author is going to take on such an expansive project, research, technique and their written word should give the reader some kind of satisfaction after the time spent by the reader to read the project. This series did not measure up, the books were redundant and boring without any new pazzazz in the following or subsequent books. I came away feeling that this was a waste of my time and disappointing. I understand this is fiction but fiction should be entertaining and engrossing and this project was a disappointment. Sorry Stephanie but I hope you do better next time; as for myself I would not recommend this saga and will not buy any future books written by this author. Thanks for listening
B002G1YPH0|5.0|So i have a E5200 CPU and it had the stock intel Heatsink-Fan setup. I bought this (along with second fan) and have seen a 20C degree drop in temperature when under stress. I went from idle at 34C to max temp 66C degrees (with stock intel HSF) to idle at 34C to max temperature under stress testing at 41C. AMAZING. It is also virtually silent in my HAF 932 case, all i vaguely hear is more airflow moving (not fan noise). I recommend this to everyone that has the room. With the knowledge that this Heatsink-Fan is keeping my CPU cool, i have now overclocked it to 3.5ghz, and still have lots of room to go for more.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I am a fan of David Cook.  His cd's are not available in Australia so I'm very happy to have been able to purchase it on Amazon.  I'm enjoying listening to David's cd very much.  I have one of his songs as my iphone default ringtone.
B00338QENI|5.0|Read \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" if... you love a good story... you are interested in science...  you like history...  you just want to read a great book.<br /><br />As a non-science person working in science setting, this book is a great introduction to important issues in research and it's totally understandable.  Also, it's the incredible story of how one woman's cells became the foundation for a lot of research into diseases and treatments, and have been for almost 60 years.  All of this and her family didn't even know about it for 25 years after her death.  The author masterfully tracks the story from a former slave cabin in Virginia to the present.  I highly recommend it, it's been great company during my travels and hope I can find something half as good to take its place.<br /><br />What's also incredible is that it's clear that Rebecca Skloot lived this story for years.  After much skepticism, the family opened up to her and you can tell that she really took their thoughts and feelings to heart.  Clearly their story and Henrietta's meant so much to her.  I heard her on NPR's \\"Fresh Air\\" talking about protecting all of her research and even telling her loved ones what to do with the unfinished book if something happened to her.  This book was a labor of love and it shows.  I think it's fantastic that Henrietta Lack's story has been told so well and so fully by Ms. Skloot.
B000EWBKK8|4.0|There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs the HDTV broadcast version. I won't discuss its merits as movie.<br /><br />Its clear BD offers more than 1080i or 720p, and it shows if you want the best video and audio visible on a big screen TV.<br /><br />Video is noticeably sharper and the sound, particularly the explosions and other arms fire, pop out and are more distinct in BD.  There is far more dynamic range and channel separation.  Its very difficult to describe a visual, but the colors are noticeably more vibrant and the edges of images  a touch sharper than even 1080i.<br /><br />For example, the opening scene of LOW shows the manufacture of bullets.  In the DVD version, a viewer didn't notice it was all CGI.  In 720p is looks CGI, in BD, its very noticeably CGI.  So what looks like a great 'realistic' effect now becomes a cartoon like opening sequence.<br /><br />The BD I received was made in 2006 or 07; it was one of the first BD releases.  It has no extras, just the movie.  Of interest, it had so many 'theft protection' stickers and do-dads it was entertaining just to open the box.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|OMG is this an incredible piece of work on all levels!  The songs, Peter Gabriel's performance, the orchestrations, the performances of the musicians (orchestra), the recording, the mixing....    I think Peter Gabriel made the right choice in doing this.    Thanks to Peter and all who had something to do with this.  I'm sure all the writers of these songs are overwhelmed hearing this...I would be!
B000IOM0WE|4.0|There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version. I won't discuss its merits as movie.<br /><br />I saw Aeon Flux on 2 DVD versions and finally BD, as different releases were made.<br /><br />This movie is best in BD. Video is noticeably sharper.  However, in colors and audio, the DVD was very well made, its not that far from the BD version.  So if you already own the DVD version, its not that big a leap in quality.<br /><br />Where it matters most are what you expect from BD, more resolution so the lines are cleaner versus jaggy in DVD.  A good DVD player will 'smooth' the jagged edges when possible, so no where is the lines of any image as tack sharp as in BD.<br /><br />This very visible as there are many 'sharp' and contrasting colors used in the movie: the blades of grass, the needle popping out of the grass, Theron's chiseled features, the straight lines of her hair style.<br /><br />The audio is not that striking either in channel separation or dynamic range.<br /><br />Overall, I bought this disk for $10. I'm not sure its good value at $16.  In contrast, there are many BD releases that truly take your breath away and are a huge leap in quality over its prior superlative DVD version, such as [[ASIN:B00129H7VS Band of Brothers [Blu-ray]]].  Clearly the format can offer more than demonstrated by the Aeon Flux's BD.
0553579908|4.0|If you are reading these lines, that most probably means that you have found your way through murky chapters of \\"A game of thrones\\" and for some reason unknown to me, you want to go on with this escapade. And if you got the feeling whilst reading the first book in the series like there isn't much happening there, you may be on familiar grounds here as well. Title kinda hints it - it's all about clash of kings right? Which kings and what clash are the question I'll not be answering here, it kinda spoils the story right? But, up to this point you have accustomed yourself to Martin's pace - you can enjoy endless narration, different points of view, constant shifts of attention and cliffhangers at the end of every single chapters - so you might as well expect that this clash book is mentioning will not be over so soon. After all, book is over 1000 pages long and one has to write something in there. If this gigantic epicness doesn't scare you than by all means you should continue with you adventure of reading. If you liked the first book, you'll like the second one - it's pretty much the same, only events differ. After all, we have to deal with those from the first book, we see some more character development, Theon Greyjoy receives a voice (which doesn't help him to develop a bit) - Martin is focusing his attention on Tyrion and events in King's Landing and everything else could be considered as a filler, Daenerys is still travelling around in search for an army, winter is coming and so on.<br /><br />Structure of the book is much the same which means that all the good bits are there as well as the bad bits. It's still crowded with words, it still has endless musings of marginal characters, it still has pseudo-medeival philospohy, there are horses, swordfights and war tactics (much more warring here than in the first book), there are sadistic tortures, slaughtering of people and all the funny bits that I guess modern fantasy epic has to have inside it. And still, in spite all the crowding it is not entirely that bad as some people would like you to think. It's intriguing, pulls you in, even cliche (stolen) bits are written in an interesting enough manner to vouch for themselves, and basically - you can't ask much more from generic medieval fantasy. I'm not a big fan of the genre so I could spill my \\"rage\\" here but I don't see the point. It's not the greatest stuff ever written, but when compared to other genre stuff it's ways ahead. Third book (and I'll write about this one soon enough starts to kick in more seriously but that's a different story). So basically, if you like the setting, if you liked first book, you should continue with this one. No new wonders but no disappointments as well.the crowding it is not entirely that bad as some people would like you to think.

B000SX89TS|4.0|KMO 4-19-2010 MUSI 2350-108 TECHNOSONICS SPRING 2010    Air, which is an acronym for the French equivalent of Love, Imagination, Dream, is an electronic music duo from Versailles that began releasing music in the 1990s. Their sound is melodic and dreamy, however the multiple electronic instruments and computer-generated composition techniques that the artists use succeed in creating catchy, danceable tracks that have made their way into popular music. It is said that band members, Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel, have drawn upon 1970s synthesizer music, pyshedelic rock, lesser-known Italian film soundtracks, and European dance music to create their own unique sound. This album, Moon Safari, is the band's second studio-produced album and was released in 1998 by France's division of Virgin Music. It is no surprise that this album reached Great Britian's Top 10 list, as Air's soft and ambient compositions make full use of current technology to produce edgy, relaxing electronic songs.       The tracks on Moon Safari which have proved to be most popular worldwide are \\"Sexy Boy\\" and \\"Kelly Watch the Stars.\\" The latter, which is the fourth song on the album, essentially repeats the songs title, but makes significant use of electronic instruments. First, the female vocals which are used throughout the album are from a computer-generated voice. Additionally in this piece, the duo uses synthesizers, and in particular a Moog synthesizer, to create an eerie, almost alien back melody, perhaps to represent the sky at night, and what perhaps exists in outer space star galaxies. This distinct, Air sound also plays off of the band's name, truly capturing elements of dream and imagination. \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\" sounds like a piece that while listening, one could lose themselves in thought.     \\"Sexy Boy\\" is a much different piece, with a significantly faster and louder rhythmic melody. This second track seems much more like a song that could be played in an edgy, urban atmosphere, although it retains much of Air's characteristic ambient sound. The use of synthesizer technology is also clear, as well as the band's use of computers to produce a much more varied vocal chorus and verse lines.     Although these two hits definitely have more popular appeal, Air excels at producing weird, but interesting and creative ambient pieces that perfectly characterize the \\"chill out\\" vibe that many critics use to describe their sound. A personal favorite on the album is \\"All I Need.\\" This second track maintains less use of computer-generated and electronic instrumentation, making the melody very catchy and relaxing. It almost sounds as if the main rhythm is played by a guitar. The female vocals are very soothing, creating a very dreamy and slow sound that is calming. In addition to the female voice, the song incorporates heavenly-sounding bells and wind, which further exemplify the song's slow, ambient nature.     For perhaps the same reasons, \\"You Make it Easy\\" is another favorite. The female vocals in this seventh track are similarly slow and high pitched like \\"All I Need,\\" and the same soft, dreamy sound is at work. This song however is sadder, and the lyrics go into much more detail and development than the other pieces on the album. Also at a closer listen, there is a lot going on in the background, which is very interesting to pay attention to. With many different sounds at work, the main melody is played by an electronic piano which towards the end of the songs, sounds like it has evolved into a string-based orchestra. From a technical standpoint, the most experimental and creative songs on Moon Safari are \\"Remember\\" and \\"Le Voyage de Penelope,\\" as the seemingly constant use of synthesizer technology and computer-instruments are almost a challenge to follow.     From an individual standpoint, the pieces \\"Tailsman\\" and \\"New Star in the Sky\\" are the least impressive tracks on the album. \\"Tailsman,\\" Moon Safari's fifth song is boring, especially falling directly after \\"Kelly Watch the Stars.\\" There are no vocals, and the piece's rhythm, which thankfully picks up halfway through the song, is missing something. Additionally, \\"New Star in the Sky\\" is very plain, with a confusing ending. With such a title, it seems as if the artists could have had so much to work with. However again with very quiet vocals, and another super slow beginning, the piece is dreary. The end of the song, which seems to sample children playing outside, is confusing, and does not seem to fit in with the rest of the piece or the title. Here, the band maybe could have elaborated more with detailed vocals about the meaning behind the song.     This is not to say however that Air's album deserves little praise; in contrast, Moon Safari is an extremely interesting and creative collection of experimental, electronic music. The overall sound of this album is dreamy and imaginative, exactly what the band's name represents. It is no wonder that Moon Safari is the band's most successful and inspirational album, as it truly exemplifies melodic, ambient music while allowing its audience to simply listen and relax.
630512762X|2.0|PLEASE understand my low rating on this video is not because of the quality of acting, it is in the \\"over loaded action\\" and unnecessarily complex story to develop the plot.  Everything blows up, and they kill a zillion cops, even the good guy \\"Travolta\\" kills some.  However, the plot lacked in believability and does not flow right.  The video was a cross between a Sci-Fi and the normal bad guy-good guy super hero who can't be killed. The movie started off with the hero's son being shot accidently instead of the \\"secret agency\\" operative for unstated reasons.  Them after 6 years the hero locates the killer and I was ready for the usual revenge seeking cop trying to capture or kill the bad guy (Gage).  But as the story dragged on and on I just wanted it to come to a conclusion. The action scenes were full of pyrotechnics and they went on et nausium. The end of the movie had the usual good guy bad guy fight to end but it went on for 15 minutes blowing up half of LA, or so it seemed.  The bad guy \\"Gage\\" even came from the dead as many cheap cop videos do, but this one dragged on and on.  The cutting off of the bad guys face and sewing it on the good cops face, after removing his real one, so he could do the ultimate undercover job to find the hidden explosives that would take out a square mile of LA, killing 1000's people was also over done. I did like the secret maximum torture prison miles out into the ocean on an old oil platform. I did wonder how Travolta swam miles and miles back to shore but they skipped that because they could not come up with how he could do it either  Watch it but turn off your mind, the noise will keep you awake and it does eventually end with the predictable mini love seen as the \\"rotten teen\\" and a \\"surrogate son\\" join the NEW \\"Nelson family\\" stereotype family.
0143039504|5.0|Jane Austen is Jane Austen--no surprises here :)<br /><br />What I do wish to say, is this: this is a beautifully bound and presented book.<br /><br />It's a good quality paperback (nice thick cover), with beautiful rough-cut/uneven edges to the pages, a very pretty cover, and it looks lovely on the shelf and in the hand. It opens nicely (without the stiffness you sometimes find in very large books).<br /><br />Although not overly bulky for such a large collection, it achieves this by having long pages with a lot of text. This is my only reservation (albeit slight): if you have difficulty with very full/long pages, perhaps this edition is not for you. There is still enough space to leave it readable, but it's a consideration.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a great movie.  If you are always looking for a movie that the whole family will enjoy, this is one of them!  Besides being a great movie, it reminds us that simple acts can have great impact.
B000002UDB|3.0|If you like listening to singles, disregard what I have to say.    Capitol's track lineup is silly.  I used iTunes and reoriented the original tracks in the order of the British 2EP release (see wikipedia's Magical Mystery Tour article).  I then inserted the singles in where I thought they were most appropriate (\\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" opens side 2, \\"Hello, Goodbye\\" opens side 3, \\"All You Need is Love\\" opens side 4).  Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane belong on Sgt. Pepper's - leave them off of this album.  (after trying nearly every possible combination, I found it most sensible to have Strawberry close side one of Pepper's and have Penny Lane between Within You and Sixty-Four)    Like I said, I think Capitol butchered this album and ruined its flow.  Why they felt the need to reorient Side 1 is beyond me.
0385334206|4.0|These books are cynical college-kid favorites. Its fun to read this book and go \\"yeah, society is stupid just like he says\\" but its a very narrow point of view. The book takes little bits of truth and distributes them as if they were the only information tid-bits available.<br /><br />Despite this the book is funny and entertaining to read. It makes numerous good, funny points and but carries with it a sick sense of despair at all humans that leaves a bad taste in your mouth about everything, including the novel itself.
