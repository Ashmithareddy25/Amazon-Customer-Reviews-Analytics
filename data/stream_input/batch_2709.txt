B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This book was a smashing success with a book group whose members normally read more than four books a month.  The books format is unusual and could seem contrived, however, in context it makes sense and contributes to the overall impression of how things tend to unfold in the real world.  I do not want to disclose the very surprising family dynamic but the reader is led to the revelation for good reason and not for a gimmicky plot twist.  This is a smart, intriguing, fascinating book and I highly recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|loved it but it really was short, need more!!! I beat it in one night. Would have been well worth the two bucks if it had have been longer. Awesome graphics though. Very much enjoyed the game. Thanks creators give us more please! My review does not need to be thirteenth long but thanks for making me do this so I can just type a bunch of words that do not portray to the review. Have a wonderful time playing.
B0000844I8|5.0|James Spader is delightful as the desheveled and wild-eyed egyptologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson, who realizes every academic's dream--and nightmare--that the most deep-pocketed of sponsors, the U.S. Military, turns him loose in a ultra-secret multi-billion dollar playground built to explore what had only been his most far-out of pet theories up to that point!  And now, instead of being ridiculed by his peers for advancing such far out theories--he is the only one able to provide the key to ancient inscriptions that provide the instruction manual for the nearly instantaneous interstellar travel provided by the Stargate!<br /><br />Spader is the personification of hubristic joy as his character alternately amazes and horrifies his military sponsors with impossibly brilliant insights and shockingly naive assumptions as they embark on their visit to another planet, star system, and galaxy--a mission that seems to have received less planning than a Cub Scout overnight camping trip.  I was especially amused by Jackson's preparation for this quest, which was to toss a few books on Egupt--and a candy bar--into a small suitcase!  Spader's very expressive face lights up with the incandescent joy of discovery as he learns to speak the ancient Egyptian language that had previously been no more than a collection of obscure symbols--and from the lips of a beautiful local girl no less!<br /><br />Although there is no lack of suspense and drama, the many escapes and evasions perpetrated by Dr. Jackson and his military cohorts, as they evade extraterrestrial bad-guys and pseudo demi-gods, seem almost like something out of the Marx Brothers or Three Stooges.  The only thing lacking would seem to be a little eye poking or cigar wagging as Jackson leaves chief bad guy Ra repeatedly in the lurch!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This would be a very entertaining game if you weren't required to purchase diamonds. I don't like to use real money in game purchases.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book! I guess you could say that I loved it so much that I read it twice since I immediately downloaded Walking Disaster upon finishing Beautiful Diaster. I feel like these characters were so true to form that it was so easy to completely fall into the story. I almost felt like i was reliving my high school days because the characters were so similar to old friends.<br /><br />This is not a traditional love story. This book and its characters test the boundry between having a normal relationship and having an all consuming relationship. It was truly a pulse exciting read.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I bought this to read about Tesla. That's what I did. The rest was drivel. Tesla's story is strong enough alone.
0399162097|5.0|Outstanding. What a beautiful and extraordinary book. I have not read a book this good, on so many levels, for a long time. I chuckled, I laughed out right, I cried...and cried and cried some more; I couldn't wait to get home and climb in bed to read it, and at the same time I wanted it never to end, and feel bereft now that I've finished.<br /><br />I heard We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves reviewed on NPR and knew at once I had to read it. This book offers so much: humour, compassion, suspense, intriguing facts and excellent writing that's understated by not calling attention to itself. It is a study of the power, or perhaps the fragility, of memory.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil this immensely readable and gripping story for readers, so stop here or beware: semi-spoiler alert.  For those of us who care deeply for animals, and care that millions, actually billions, are tortured in laboratories or industrial farming, this book is a beautiful ray of light. While I'm not sure what the solution to ending cruelty and suffering is, I think books like this--where the facts are simply stated, but not in a preachy sort of way--are part of it. It touched me deeply on many levels. I think, perhaps, most of all it made me feel what it would be like to have Fern as my sister. I hope and think others will be able to imagine and feel her too. She is very vivid and very much alive beside me right now.<br /><br />We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is tender and compelling and surely serves to educate people about what really goes on in laboratories, if not awaken their hearts and nudge them to speak out for the animals who have no voice ( at least no voice most people hear or understand.)<br /><br />An excellent book, a beautiful story. I still feel little Fern deep within me as I type this. Thank you for bringing her to life... for so many people around the world.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1626360200 Flash's Song: How One Small Dog Turned into One Big Miracle]]

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game. addictive and helps the time go by at work. I recommend it to everyone. I wish I could post more stars
B000FA675C|5.0|Very good book. And for the price it was a no-brainer. It was the kind of deal that gets you started reading more books.
B00AOQ8MOQ|5.0|Great movie I recommend it to all movie lovers.<br />Good movie to make it a movie night with popcorn n pizza u won't be diss appointed.
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|To be honest, I listen to mostly classical, and while AccuRadio seems to offer a greater variety (fewer repeats), Pandora's sound quality is better.  And really, don't you want Pavarotti at his most sublime?
044024613X|4.0|90% of this book was &#34;can't put down&#34; quality...things just keep taking different turns.  There is empathy and shock; the story drives ahead forcefully.  Then, all of a sudden, it's over!  The story with-in or over-arching the one story is clever and brought nothing but admiration for the writer.  I hope there is a sequel to carry on the story because the characters are interesting and the style of writing is engaging.  Enjoyable!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Sure, there were some errors in portraying the justice system, but this is not, after all, a story about the justice system.  It is a story told by a father about a family's attempt to deal with the unimaginable.  Despite having seen the ending coming, it was devastating, and it took me a bit of time to gather myself to think critically.  For those who find the mother's actions unbelievable, I would say they are more believable, and ultimately more indicative of selfless love, than the father's devotion to his own blindness.  The one time I was pulled right out of the story with an \\"Oh, come on now!\\", was the dad's complete lack of reaction to the dog story (no spoilers here).  We all read and watch TV enough to know what his son's behavior portends.  Still, overall the book works quite well and left me thinking about it for a long while after I finished it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My son (8 years old) loves his game.  It is great for car rides...or boring times when he needs some entertainment....<br />I am not that good at it, but I can see where it can get addictive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I Love this game. Its not too hard but not too easy either! It definitely makes you think. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent book, the story keeps you reading up to the end.<br />Mandatory recommendation for anyone looking for a good reading.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|I love the set but you don't get many Rohirrim Soldiers if you put them together with helms deep who has no standard soldiers. I would recommend that the Lego company make those mini 9.99 or 14.99 sets like in lego star wars where they contain four soldiers and some little things like a speeder in star wars or in lotr a few horses. Then you could make the battle scenes more enjoyable with thicker armies.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|Very well done fictional take on the 2008 financial crisis. Though fiction, I feel like it gives an entertaining yet informative look at how some of the massive financial institutions work. Great cast.
B005BGBP3Y|5.0|would recommend to watch, it is funny, serious, and entertaining, hope I never find myself in a complicated relationship like that
B00BC24NT4|3.0|I was expecting more from this but unfortuneatly it didn't reach my expectationes. Plot is a bit dull, the characters aswell and in general a average read.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|How can anyone not love The Avengers!  Awesome adventure and great special effects. I will watch it many times over and over!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is completely awesome when you open chests with pearls  you can earn them back when you get rare fish all you have to do to get rare fish is plant about 5  rare plant seeds and you will get at least 2 rare fish and every three days they will give you a pearl but you do have to feed them a good amount of algae in order to give  pearls.

B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I enjoyed it.  I have read the old book that had some of the monsters in it.  I liked that the story line was enough different that it was new to me.  Good job.

B002M5E2DW|5.0|Very powerful message.  This is a must read for everyone.  I highly recommend it.  I am going to read the Power of the Secret next, also bvby Rhonda Byrne.  This is one you will read over and over again.  It is very inspiring.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have enjoyed all of these books. Very sensitive to the lives of people affected by strife & war. Good read!!

B007A2O3FO|4.0|Julian Fellowes adapted the screenplay from Lucy M. Boston's novel `The Chimneys of Green Knowe' and as expected, especially when he directs his own films the story though slight is filled with elegance, grace and rich atmosphere. With a splendid cast it truly comes to life.<br /><br />Set in 1940s England, 13-year-old Tolly (Alex Etel) is sent to stay with his grandmother (Maggie Smith) at her country home, which she fears she will have to sell due to money problems. Tolly's father is fighting in WWII, and is missing in action. As his grandmother tells him about the history of the house, and Tolly's ancestors, he finds that he is able to travel back in time to 1805 and discover secrets about his family's past, which still resonate today. The idea of time lapse is present in the story from 1805 - which centers around Tolly's ancestors, the kindly Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) and his selfish wife Maria (Carice van Houten) and their children Sefton, a spoiled, selfish young man (Douglas Booth) and a kindly, blind girl Susan (Eliza Bennett). Into their lives comes Jacob (Kwayedza Kureya), a former slave who escapes from captivity with the help of Captain Oldknow and joins the household as a companion for Susan, much to the chagrin of Sefton. The primary storyline is set in the 1940s, with Tolly and his grandmother worrying about what has become of Tolly's father, while at the same time getting to know and understand each other.  The cast is augmented with character roles played by Timothy Spall, Dominic West, Douglas Booth, Rachel Bell and Pauline Collins.<br /><br />This is a spirited adventure ghost story played two centuries apart and for those who enjoy the artistry of Julian Fellowes, this is a fine evening's diversion. Grady Harp, July 13
B004IDG97S|5.0|I had seen this movie before and enjoyed it, I watched it again because I met Scott Wilson on The Walking Dead season 3. I knew he had a very entertaining role and I wanted to see it again.<br />This movie had adventure and laughs, my Mom enjoyed it too.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I started watching seasons 1 and 2 the last month.  I like the show so much that I watch 2 or 3 episodes each night.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Very, very well done. I would not hesitate to recommend this series. Ian Richardson is a fabulous character, who evolves as the plot thickens.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This is a handy item if you're on the go, but I feel it doesn't substitute a proper wetstone and a shapening iron.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|We watched the last 2 episodes last night. Fast paced and intelligent story well told. Excellent and sorry it is over.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I only wanted to use Google for my browser on my Kindle Fire, I figure this app would do just that and sadly it did not. The app is filled with so much junk, It's more of an annoyance if anything. It would have been a far better app if it was less cluttered. Personally, I hated how I had to search something at the top of the app then click on the section that I wanted to search through. Did not like how they have a Videos section either, Google owns Youtube, Would it kill them to simply replace videos with the Youtube app instead?<br /><br />Honestly, Don't even bother with it. You are better off just getting another browser app (Internet Explorer) and bookmarking Google for quick and easy access.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Some people are talking bulls*t about this record. The one thing I know It is a great comeback and its is worthy every cent. The guys are in top form and there are on the album all Sabbath tunes and riffs we loved from their early works.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's a good looking game. Original and fun. It's challenging though and it can be frustrating at times when you constant mess up. Also, I think they could do better in the upgrade section, Add some new characters and all that. Other then that, Not a bad game and it's free so why not check it out.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|A beautiful love story but more importantly, it was such a vivid portrayal of what studying abroad in the U.S is like for many of us. Reading Americanah was like taking a trip down memory lane.... Another masterpiece by Adichie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome app.  I don't like in app purchases in a game, but the quality of this game is amazing.  Stunning 3D graphics, flawless gameplay.  Easy enough to manuever that my kids can play, but challenging enough for me to enjoy.  I love that every time you restart the run, you get a knew scenerio (not the same boring run).  Thank you Gameloft!  Another Grand Slam!
B004JM8X5E|5.0|I've always loved Powder, it's a sad and intense movie but very uplifting for me in the thought that one day things may be different.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season was really good.  We are big Dexter fans.  I thought Season 6 was a little weak.  Season 7 is better.  Worth the purchase.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Things start to make it turn into less of a hero show, but are certainly interesting as they develop. (1 more word required)
B00908DDZM|5.0|I really, really like this album.  I ordered the CD from Amazon, and it arrived quickly.  It also came with a free download.  I liked that I was able to download it immediately, and then my husband could have the CD.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|People were raving about this movie, so I watched and it Jesus. It wasn't the best thing ever.  It was okay.  Also, my cat died while I was watching it, so maybe that influenced my view on the film.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|hours and hours of fun! plays great on my kindle fire. gameloft once again did not disappoint. love this game!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I read this book it's like I'm in the dimension where I'm the one only trying to survive. The multiple questions in this book are like me asking myself how will I stay alive. After I saw the movie I was like I really wanted to read the book and when I got my kindle the first thing I got was the Hunger Games movie and the book. I'm not a big book fan the only time I will read a book is if someone's is reading it to me or if the books reading itself and I never read by myself because I always had the voice reading to me but this book Is the only book I would read my hole Sunday. I love the Hunger Games
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app gets your mind working and active. the puzzles remind me a little bit of some of the Nancy drew games.
B008G3N71W|5.0|Awesome find. This book was so hot. A little strange but oh my God it had some great parts. I definitely recommend
B005IQZB14|5.0|A true story that will catch your attention and keep you reading until through.  Not something I would like to do, but interesting to get her perspective on a trek like this!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I like it so much for the same thing as the last few months ago from me anymore and I hope this is a turn for the same
159463176X|3.0|I often begin writing something and somewhere after 20 minutes, I find what I've written kind of egotistic and boring so I eventually give up knowing well that the beginning was WOW. A similar fate dawns on this book by Hosseini. He began this book very well, the first 33% as a treat really, I would say read the book if only just for the 1/3rd bit. By the middle of it, he starts to show off a bit, jumping from one character to another to another...it's like those tv show dramas trying to validate multiple lives, what this book does is it will start speaking of a character and then jump into another's life, makes that another's life very interesting and just when you want a question answered, it will jump into another life, I wish he wasn't so, well, stupid. It's a good book but it could have been so much better. He really has a great gift and he should stick to a formula which works rather than trying to show case skills he doesn't posses.<br /><br />My favourite character in the book was Nabi and enjoyed reading about his life of servitude in the book. The book opens with a father telling his children a story. That was most heart warming. Those are the highlights of the book for me. I felt the French linking wasn't very interesting.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Excellent quality--so good to hear Tapestry, my favorite album, again!  Carole King takes me back to my college days, and what a joy to hear Carole King again.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|Best western ever made with cast of stars: John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson. Ward Bond and feisty Walter Brenen.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|It was so good to hear Abbey Road again!  I had a vinyl Abbey Road which has many skips on it.  The CD--great quality and it came quickly.
B007FC3AAI|4.0|Fast paced action. Enjoyed characters as they interacted.<br />There was chemistry between the actors afte so many years working together.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this app it's great for kids who can get a feel what it's like to take care of something
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I just love this game. I have played a lot and got loads of dragons with 4 islands. So many dragons to breed and place. The possibilities are endless! I hope you love it as much as me and my friends did.
B005544TRQ|4.0|A good watch for those times you want to smile and don't have time for a full flick. A true look at lawyers world
1781162646|5.0|Typical Stephen King..always great to read.  Kept interest til the end.  Left you wanting more.  Stephen King is best author.
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|Really cute! Chemistry set version of Cleo and Ghoulia. My daughter has glasses so she loves dolls that have them too. The dress for Ghoulia is really cute because it has their version of the periodic table pattern on it. Fast shipping, packaged well. Would buy again.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I LOVE IT.  Quartet is a beautiful movie with dignity and beauty  in a magnificent setting!!  A pleasure to watch and enjoy.  This type of movie is a rarity these days.  Thank you for making it.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|I had hoped the participation of original participants Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell would bring something worthwhile to this, but it turns out to be nothing more than just another money-making venture with none of the appeal that made the original film \\"ferociously original\\". This is just an attempt to squeeze a few more dollars out of fans of the original ED films before we all die off. And while I'm at it, can the producers of new movies drop this whole \\"Ultraviolet\\" business? How many passwords, accounts, web sites, and email addresses is it supposed to take before \\"UV\\" is worthwhile?
0330535420|5.0|I enjoyed reading Hell's Corner. It kept my attention through out. I give it 5 stars. I'll read Baldacci again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great acting and storyline.  The zombies are secondary to the story, it's the survivors who are the focus.  You really care what happens to them.  Can hardly wait for Season 4.  Have recommended to my friends.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|Enjoyed the first half of the book but then it became too preachy about animal rights. It started sounding more like a book report one of my students would have written on the topic. It did provide some interesting insights into the chimp studies and was worth the read.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|The songs on this album are not all uniform.  There is a very pleasant variety to the musical sounds, and all the songs are catchy.
B000059TEQ|5.0|I be so sad atter I red ths cry baby book or cause it don read so good on the little taper
1449408656|5.0|As a fellow cat lady, Yasmine really hits it out of the ballpark with her funny, cute little comics about the ups and downs of cat ownership. I'm a huge fan of hers and check her blog every day looking for updates. This book is a fantastic gift for cat lovers! :)
B00CA4S27W|5.0|If your a Blackmore fan you will love this one Ritchies tribute to Jon Lord..Carry On ..Jo is a master piece and shows what Jon meant to him.Lots of statacaster in this one I think one of there best !
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This was a lot of fun for my 6 year old daughter and myself but then it would just freeze and stop loading after a few levels.  I tried uninstalling and installed again, but same thing happened.  Very disappointed.  Other than that, the game play was good and the graphics were wonderful!  Very detailed and colorful
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love this film so much. it really is my favorite Jane Eyre film. I highly recommend it to any Bronte fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is apsolutly incredible! I just love all the graphics! my favorite part about the game is the updates they're cool.If they keep updating sooner. or later this game will turn into minecraft xboc. or even PC or Mac!
B004I1AGTC|4.0|As the sequel to Ip Man this was a pretty good movie. The fighting sequences were not overdone for the most part although that is why I gave it only 4 stars. There were just to many techniques that came right out of the early Kung Fu flicks of the 60's & 70's that probably should have been toned down some. Fortunately no one was jumping straight up in the air 15-20 feet to a tree branch or rooftop. On the other hand, hitting someone in the chest with a palm strike isn't going to drive them 5-6 feet off the ground and throw them 15-20 feet away.<br />Another thing rather interesting is that, like most contemporary Kung Fu films, Ip Man 2 is premised on an underlying theme of Chinese suppression and degradation by foreigners. In the first Ip Man it was the Japanese, in this sequel, the British. This theme was also the premise of most of Bruce Lee's films; the Chinese fighting back against claims of the, &#34;weak men of China&#34;.<br /><br />That said, this was a fun movie to watch if you like the martial arts. It also makes it enjoyable when you realize many of these actors have studied martial arts and put so much time into the choreography. This is especially true with the close-quartered hand/arm techniques being presented as Wing Chun. In that regard, the actors did a super job of displaying their own individual abilities. Sammo Hung has always amazed me with his agility considering he isn't exactly a &#34;Bruce Lee&#34; specimen of physical fitness....even when he was younger.<br /><br />To conclude, I recommend this movie if you want some good, clean, martial arts fun and put aside the fact that this movie isn't a documentary as to the real life of Yip Man.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|have been hearing a lot of great things about this book. I have even heard some people find similarities between it and the 50 Shades (which is by no means even close to a YA book). Or at least the two books used in the same sentence. Now, I haven't made it past the first 50 Shades book, but I don't think this book is anything like it. For one, it is extremely well written.<br /><br />Maybe it is the co-dependency aspect? There were, at times, in this book, that Travis became really creepy to me when it came to that. But I do think that is the point. He is this extremely hot guy who feels nothing for no one, uses people for his own means/pleasure and now finds himself feeling something very deeply for someone else, and he just doesn't want to let her go. To the point of obsessiveness. But she is so totally in love with him that it didn't faze her. Even when they found themselves apart, they were still technically together.<br /><br />And there were a lot of weird things thrown in, like gambling, Vegas, mobsters and underground college fighting circles. But it is written in a way that makes it all fall in place. Although, a bunch of college kids just jetting off to Vegas for a weekend, makes you wonder where they get their funds. Well, at least you know where two of them get them, at least. Some of it anyway.<br />Was this book perfect? No. Were there flaws? Yes. Does it matter? Not one bit.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is the perfect title for this book.<br /><br />I got emotional many times throughout the book, happy, sad, crying, angry, every facet of emotions I could go through. And I could not put this book down. It is the first book in a long time that I read so quickly, to the point of putting off things that needed done so I could get it finished. And even now I still find myself thinking about it. I want to go back to certain parts of the book and reread them. This book has implanted itself into my brain, and will most likely be there for a while to come.<br />This is definitely a must read.<br /><br />See the review at [...]r />This is definitely a must read.<br /><br />See the review at [...]
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book! Its sooo alive. You can smell the characters, emphathise with them, get angry with them.... I mean, they are sooo alive. You can even feel the protagonist's thinking and her decisions rankling inside her mind.<br /><br />Khaled, does make a good art of painting using words.<br /><br />The book indeed touched me!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|In the last  few months, Sylvia day has become one of my favorite authors.  The Crossfire Series combines romance, an edge of erotica, and a bit of suspense to make a great combination of reading fun.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva have a ton of issues to work through.  Not just their current issues, but the problems and baggage from their past as well.  In Entwined With You, they are working their way back to each other while dealing with their various problems and family issues as well.<br /><br />I found this book to be fairly good.  I was not as involved with this book as I was the first two.  It was good, but it lacked the spark that the first two of the series contained.  This book offers a continuation of the story, without really giving closure to some of the major plot lines.

B008UX2UIO|2.0|Well written, intelligent, but quite stupid also.  No redeeming characters and the farce dragged on for four hundred pages.  Surprise ending didn't really save it in my opinion.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I have returned to Gatlin, South Carolina for the sequel to the awesome book Beautiful Creatures. And let me tell you....Garcia and Stohl only get better as they go along. If you thought Beautiful Creatures was good, you HAVE to read Beautiful Darkness. In this book, you not only get the smalll town feel of Gatlin, but you also get so much more. This book is darker, filled with more angst, and overall much better written! I was excited to the max about this one!<br />The Positives<br />Where do I begin....well on my last post I started with the world of Gatlin being a positive, so I will expand on that for Beautiful Darkness. Not only do we still get to experience the \\"charming\\" Gatlin, we also get to travel with Ethan, Link, and a new friend (more on her later) in other parts of the south. The authors do a great job tying in important places in the south (like famous buildings in Savannah) with the Caster world. Speaking of the Caster world, you really learn a lot more about the Caster world in this book than you do in the previous novel. I felt less confused about Lena's life after reading this book than when I read the first one.<br />Ethan and Lena go though some rough patches in this novel, and I guess that is not a \\"positive\\" persay when it comes to the \\"star crossed lovers\\" idea that Ethan and Lena are, but the way that Garcia and Stohl handle the snafus makes this a positive. You learn at the end of Beautiful Creatures that Ethan and Lena's relationship will be anything but easy, and honestly it is really rough in this book. You really question whether or not it will even last. But isn't that the case with any relationship? When the people in the relationship goes through changes, that can cause stress in the relationship. This concept is handled beautifully in this book.<br />The New Guys: We are introduced to two new people that are significant to the plot line...Olivia (Liv) Durand and John Breed. Each of them are temptations to Ethan and Lena throughout the novel...a mortal girl for Ethan  and a Caster for Lena. I love that Garcia and Stohl threw in these new people to test Ethan and Lena's relationship. Plus, I have a feeling they will be important later.<br />The Negatives<br />I would have to say that my biggest \\"negative\\" in this book is Lena herself. I found myself really getting angry with her (mainly because Ethan has won my heart so much). I understand that she is lost and that she needs guidance, but she makes so many wrong decisions in this novel. I think that the authors could have been less severe with her character in this one.<br />Please please please take the time to read this book (and this series honestly) you will not be disappointed!!<br /><br />See the review at [...]the novel...a mortal girl for Ethan  and a Caster for Lena.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a very fun app. I have enjoyed it very much. I would recommend to a friend. Will tell my friends about it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|While I understand that this blog is primarly for adult genred books, I feel like sometimes we run across a book that transcends all genres and that everyone should read. A Fault in Our Stars is that book. It is so well written, intense, and impactful that anyone 15-100 would be touched and love this book.<br /><br />The Positives<br />This book follows Hazel, a 16 year old that is living with Stage IV cancer and not much else. She sits at home with her mom and dad, reading, and watches America's Next Top Model. The thing about Hazel is that even though she has given up being regular because of the cancer, it does not affect her sense of humor. She is a really witty and fun girl to be with, and the cancer does not really define that part of her. She reminds me of a girl that I used to teach that is surviving cancer. She is so intelligent and does not let cancer affect her personality. She is not a girl with cancer, she is a girl....who happens to be sick. Hazel is an inspiration to everyone.<br /><br />Hazel meets Augustus Waters at a cancer support group meeting and pretty much falls head over heels in love with him in like the first 10 minutes of meeting him. He is bright, funny, and pretty much the male equivalent of Hazel. They hit it off right away and have a brilliant relationship. I will not give too much of the book away, but he is a dream guy and a great catch. I love his attitude and the way he leads his life. He is top notch.<br /><br />The thing I like most about the book is the emotions that Green delves into. You feel joy, anger, and most of all heart-wrenching sadness while you are going through the life of these two young people. The relationship between the two of them is so sweet and tender, they are in love and that makes your heart swell. Then by the end of the book , you are ugly girl crying. I actually clutched the book in my arms and rocked back and forth while bawling when the book was finished. It is a roller coaster of emotions, but in a most awesome and powerful way.<br /><br />The Negatives<br />The only thing that I wished was done differently was I wish there was an epilogue that let us know how Hazel was doing after the conclusion of the book. Did she go into remission? Did her lungs stop filling up with so much fluid? Did she die? I hate being left hanging when I am invested in a character.<br /><br />The Verdict<br />Make this book one of your number 1's right away! It is worth a place on your bookshelf. EVERYONE in the world must read this book!<br /><br />See the review at [...]st awesome and powerful way.<br /><br />The Negatives<br />The only thing that I wished was done differently was I wish there was an epilogue that let us know how Hazel was doing after the conclusion of the book.

B0028IDXDS|4.0|fast shipping got faster than i thought i would. wish it was a little better on price and almost paid as much for shipping but good product and baby loves it !
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I finally got the opportunity to finish this wonderful series, and I thought this would be a perfect book to use as our YA tribute, especially considering I have already shone the spotlight on the first two books in the series. Before continuing, take a look at the review of the first two books in the Delirium Series here<br /><br />Requiem was a great ending to an already great series! The interesting thing about this book is that we get the perspective of both Lena (in the Wilds) and Hana (cured; living in the city), so we can understand the fallout of the government attacks on the Invalids and their fighting back from both the view of the people fighting and the view of the people that the Invalids are fighting against. I find that perspective fascinating! The only issue I found with this set up was that Hana's sections seemed to be an afterthought compared to Lena's. I am not sure if that was the intention of Oliver because of the emotional depravity of the cured, but I was not a fan. I found myself skimming Hana's portions. At least until the end when the two \\"came together\\" if you will.<br /><br />I think the best way to approach this novel is to look at each side separately at first, so I will start with Lena (my favorite section!)<br /><br />Lena<br /><br /> Lena If you have read my first post, you know that I am not a Lena fan for the majority of the series...this book does not really fix that in my opinion. I still find her to be whiny and stubborn (to the point that it can become dangerous). However, the Wilds really did change her from a whiny uncured to a strong, take charge kind of whiner. Despite the horrendous living conditions and constant life threatening situations, Lena has the best of both worlds. She has two guys that love her, the escape she always wanted, and an independent life. However, she can't stop finding things to complain about! For example the new girl, Clover. I get that she is goo goo over Alex, but maybe if you have not moved on to guy # 2 not even like 6 months after you thought he was dead, then maybe he would pay you more attention. Also her need to be the leader kind annoyed me too. It is made known in Pandemonium that Tack and Raven were the leaders and made the decisions. But it seems that just because Lena has \\"been there\\" then she feels she should be a part of the decision making process. She needs to grow up, even more than she already has!<br /><br />Julian v. Alex I am an Alex fan, let's just get that point straight from the beginning. I LOVED him in Delirium, and it broke my heart in Pandemonium when Lena moved on to Julian. But in Requiem, he was an intolerable jerk face!  I understand that he was angry over the fact that Lena moved on, and that living in the Crypts for an extend period of time would make anyone crazy...but he was an ass! Lena seemed generally sorry for what happened, and wanted to make amends, but he was having none of it!!<br /><br />Now Julian I actually liked in this book. He was strong and dependable. He pulled his weight in the Wilds, yet he was tender and loving where Lena was concerned. I really feel bad for him that she did not treat him as well as he deserved (I don't want to give too much away). I really think she should have chose him! (Which makes my stomach ache...see the beginning of this section)<br /><br />Lena's Mom If you are aware of the basic plot line of the series, you know that Lena was lead to believe that her mother was dead, and that she died when Lena was a young girl. Alex (gently) told Lena in Delirium that her mother was in fact alive and that she was part of the resistance. Lena actually gets the chance in Pandemonium to \\"meet\\" her mother, even though she was not actually introduced as such (but you know it's her). Okay, now we are caught up. Lena gets the opportunity to actually spend time with her mother, and the moment was....lackluster. I was really disappointed in the way that it was brushed over. I expected to see some dramaand suspense, and also have a great drawn out exchange between the two. I mean, her whole life she thought she was dead! I wanted more than a page and a half of interaction, then a paragraph explaining all the conversation that was had! I am happy that they got to meet, and I am happy that Lena had the opportunity to explain how hurt she was, I just wish there was more.<br /><br />Hana<br /><br />Now the Hana portion of this book was not as awesome as Lena's part, but the information was still relevant. We learn that Hana is now cured and engaged to the most powerful man in their world...Fred Hargrove...the mayor's son. Not only will she be a happy wifey to the mayor, she will have the happy life she always wanted. Well the life she was programmed to want. I find Hana to be easily manipulated and naive. She could not assume that Fred would not want revenge over his father's death (Pandemonium). And let me tell you, if Alex is an ass....Fred is a SUPER ass!! I can't go into too much detail, but you will HATE Fred Hargrove after you learn just how assy he is!!<br />The cool thing about Hana, is that once she learns the secrets behind her marriage, and sees the world through a cured's eyes...she starts to change. She seems to change back into the Hana that we kinda loved in Delirium. And her interaction with Lena's cousin, Grace, is precious! You will forgive Hana for all her sins after you read her parts.<br /><br />The story<br /><br />The thing that I liked most about this book was not the characters or the dialogue, it was the genius behind the structure. It was if she was writing two different books that joined into one awesome book at the end! I really enjoyed how the merger took place at the (in my opinion) climax of the story. That was really smart on her part.<br />The Verdict<br />Even though it sounds as if I had a lot of negative ideas about this book, I really enjoyed it! I think everyone should read it and give props to Lauren Oliver for a great series!!<br /><br />See the review at [...]and suspense, and also have a great drawn out exchange between the two.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is so much fun, and if your having trouble you can just switch between zombies and allies, so you can keep playing.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Well readers, we are back again!! Time to review another fabulous book by Sylvia Day, this time Eve of Destruction; the fantastic sequel to Eve of Darkness.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book is ten times better than Eve of Darkness, and I LOVED that book!! This book is full of drama, jealousy, action, and overall awesomeness!!<br />The Postivies<br />I really love that we see Eve more in this book on her own; rather than with a babysitter all of the time (ie Alec, Reed, her mother). She gets a chance to shine among her peers and show that she is worthy of all the craziness that is surrounding her. Because of this, we learn more of her strengths and weaknesses and we get a snapshot of how strong she will be in the next book, which rocks.<br />I am excited that we get to know Reed better in this book. In the last book, he really seems like an arogant jerk who only wants to \\"bed\\" Eve to make his brother jealous and ultimatley bring Alec down. In the sequel, he is still arogant and \\"jerky\\" at times, but we understand why. That he has trust issues and is scared of his true feelings. He never wanted to like Eve, but he seems to be growing attached and that is scary. He doesn't seem like the type to not be in control, and so when he loses control he freaks out and goes into jerk mode. He is just a typical guy....with wings :)<br />I also really like that we see the Marks in the field in this novel. The whole \\"Mark\\" world is really new and is not something that has been written about by any author that I have read, so it was time to see what the fuss was all about. It is really intense when you get right down to what all the cadets have to do in order to erase their sins. Day was really creative with this aspect of the story. She has an awesome voice, and it shows!!<br />I am excited that we get to get a visual in our heads about Hell and that we get to meet the devil! That may sound weird, but in book one we really didn't know the true evil. So I am happy that we are now aquainted with the devil and his minions. It makes for good reading!<br />The Negatives<br />There are not really too many negatives to report (because this book is GRRREEEATT!!) but I do feel like I should mention a few.<br />I was not happy with the lack of Alec in this book. I mean he was there...but not THERE. I was really liking the whole Alec/Eve relationship that was building in book one, and I feel like she went away from it in book two. I mean, we do have interaction, but they seem to be losing their way. Especially with what happens toward the end (I won't give the spoiler...read and find out!!)<br />I am not looking foward to reading more about the Alec/Eve/Reed love triangle. It just creeps me out that she is \\"bedding\\" two brothers (mentally I might add) and I feel like that it will only get more creepy as the series progresses. I hope I am not wrong :)<br />The Verdict<br />Get this book!! And then read the next one !!! I know I will!!<br /><br />See the review at [...]aquainted with the devil and his minions.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|Pandemonium  is Lauren Oliver's sequel to the Delirium series. This book starts right after Lena flees her hometown with Alex to avoid the cure; only to find out that Alex is missing, presumed dead. This book focuses on what life is like in the Wilds and how difficult it is for the people that have fled rather than getting the love sickness cure.<br /><br />We meet several new people that are essential to Lena's survival in the Wilds such as Tack, Blue, and Raven. We also are introduced to Julian, Lena's \\"love interest\\" in the book. There are a few more important people, but I will leave that a surprise for when you read it (if you haven't yet).<br /><br />The Positives<br />I really enjoyed this book for a few reasons. First of all, in Delirium  you only imagine how the \\"invalids\\" act, you are not introduced to them specifically. Instead, you get a picture of them in your mind and you hope that you are not wrong. In Pandemonium  you get to experience the \\"invalids\\" and the risks that they take living in the Wilds. You learn their system of survival, how they communicate in the town, and how they create relationships that are meaningfuly while they are living in squaller. I appreciated the struggle and I admired those who lived in this way. It make me have a newfound respect for the book/series, one that I did not have when I read the first one.<br /><br />I really liked how the book showed pieces of time from the past and the present and how they were all mixed together. You really get a sense of not only how Lena learned to survive in the Wilds, but how that helped her accomplish her tasks as an invalid. I found that outline to work in this context.<br /><br />The Negatives<br /> I say it all the time, sequels of trilogies tend to fall in the middle book syndrome and this is no different. While I get that it is important to read and learn about Lena's new life in the Wilds, how she grew to the strong person we meet at the end of the novel, and how the revolution starts; I do not think that it needed to be its own book. I love how authors these days to \\"novellas\\" or short books in between the first and second books, and I feel that she could have shortened this book and made it a novella. I would have liked it more that way.<br /><br />I was succchhhh an Alex fan in book one, that I hate the fact that she found someone to move on to in this book. I do get that we need a romantic element to this book (especially considering the fact that they are fighting the love cure in the first place) it just seems like she moved on too fast. The love of her life, the one that convinced her to leave her home and change her life just \\"died\\" and it just did not seem to take her very long to move on with her life. Kind of insensitive to me, maybe I am biased.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Despite the negatives (all books have them) this series ROCKS if you are a fan of dystopias. You really need to read up on these and get ready....Requiem is out and is ready to roar!! I cannot wait to get my hands on that one and complete my love of this series. Also, she has several little novellas that tie in important characters from their persepectives. Check those out too!!<br /><br />See this review at [...]tarts; I do not think that it needed to be its own book.

Such a \\"lucky\\" number!  ;)  I never read any of the leaks that came from this book, nor what others had said.  That made it nice reading this book with my own views and hopes for Sookie.  All I got to say is, this ended with what I was expecting for Sookie!  Now, many of the events that happened, I didn't expect, which was great!<br /><br />Charlaine Harris gave us a world filled with vampires, shapeshifters, witches and humans with more than the typical senses.  I'm sad to see this series end, but the joy is in that I can re-read all the books again, and enjoy the stories!<br /><br />See the review at [...]

B009R659L8|4.0|Daddy's Gone A Hunting is a mystery with a lot of twists and turns. The background of the book is this...two sisters have a dark past they don't really remember but it comes back to haunt them. A father who is a womanizing drunk that does not have time for his two daughters and he is interested more in money than in his family. A war veteran who can't stand people, a plant manager who is shady and many more twists and turns in the book.<br /><br />Only Mary Higgins Clark can write a story about an explosion at the antique furniture plant and make it tie into a missing person story from 30 years ago. It sounds crazy but, trust me, it makes sense once you read the book.<br />I love how the story takes on so many different avenues to make you wonder how it all fits together. I love how Mary Higgins Clark can spin a story. I appreciate the fact that MHC can write a book without all the gory violence and all the bad language some authors feel is necessary. MHC can spin the story and do it in a way that my teenage daughters can read her books without fear from mom about the violence or the language.<br /><br />See the review at [...]

B00AFEY7QO|3.0|This is basically similar sound; remakes of previous songs.  Good background music, but not to much original work or sound to it.<br />.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|...and you shouldn't either. The extras are awesome, while some of them have been around for a while in other formats (DVD featurettes comes to my mind), there are several new ones for all of us fanboys.

I love it almost as much as her show. Hope we see more episodes from Rachel. Like the show, the book is colorful, fun, and yet helpful.

B00C7O8TSM|4.0|Very happy that the boys were able to do the 50th anniversary tour. Delighted that they included many tunes not usually included in their &#34;Best Of&#34; albums and not often performed in their later concerts.<br />But I am appalled at the heavy handed editor at Capitol who butchered the endings of most of the songs by prematurely cutting the sound and incredibly cut off the first note from some intros. I guarantee Brian would have never passed this editing job. I wish I could complain to someone who mattered at Capitol.<br />On the plus side, these guys can still sing in their old age - even if Brian had to have another band member do the falsetto work. And who knew that David Marks would become an accomplished guitarist?<br />If you are a fan of The Beach Boys, you should own this possibly final piece of their recorded history.

B00969GFFU|3.0|I think some of the reviewers here read a different book than I did.<br />This book is a mild satire<br />Walter in particular is a characterization of many lefty \\"do gooding \\" true believers. He is satirically hilarious.<br />And as for the comment about the couple were estranged for 6 years and this was unbelievable , well all I can say is Miss Haversham in Great Expectations.<br />Grief does some extremely strange things to people, obviously some reviewers have not had that great grey bird land on their shoulders eh ?<br />My issue with the book is Franzen doesnt go far enough. He doesnt go for the satiric jugular. This writer has rare gifts and he does remind me of Tom Wolf at his best.<br />Why Bonfire of the Vanities hits it out of the park is Tom Wolf does go for the jugular , he hits the reader over the head with the callow, connivance and venal venom of his creations that stalked the corridors of power of that era. Wolf held a mirror up to us all and said \\"this is what is going on , this is the cost of your Masters of the Universe on Wall St\\". We live with the \\"Masters\\" to this day, it took a literary turn to show us what was in store for us in the financial meltdown of 2007 even though Bonfire was written in 1987. Great satire can do that...<br />Either Mr Franzen gives us the goods that he is capable of, or he will be another also ran.<br />Or as Somerset Maugham said of his own writings \\" I am in the front row of the second rate\\"

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|If you or your children like to doodle, draw etc you may like this. Otherwise the kids will play with it for a few minutes and then go back to their other games they find more challenging.

B00DJFIMW6|2.0|No instructions regarding what the object of the game is or what the components represent.  It is mindless and does not make sense.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Downloaded this for my kindle fire... works like a champ. Alarm has saved me from over sleeping more times than I can count. Easy to use also.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The minions are so funny. Can't wait to see Part 2. They were actually comedy for all of us. The movie was awesome. My sis used to watch this all the time

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this show, even though Mike is not a real lawyer, he seems to have the smarts down. That is the only part of the show I dislike wholeheartedly that he is not a real lawyer, which is a direct slap in the face to all lawyers everywhere. Otherwise, the show provides great entertainment, despite it not being ethical and all that.
B00CHS31DG|3.0|Remember wat i told u abot Ghost Radar Classic. Well ill review this one .  OMG ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME ANOTHER ONE. CLASSIC IS THE BOMB WHY DO THEY HAVE TO MAKE AN ANOTHER ONE.

B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I have not always been a huge Fall Out Boy fan, only purchasing their debut album other than this one. I saw that Butch Walker had produced this one, and had to preview it. Once I did, I could tell that it had that little bit of extra that I was looking for and it spiced up my musical tastes for summer as it was something different for the season, and it had been a while since I purchased an album with interesting vocals such as this. I love that Elton is on Save Rock n' Roll. A classic voice, when added to the newer FOB sound, meshes perfectly. Well done.
B0013D69YE|5.0|Come Closer feat Luther Vandross, Be With You, Work It Out, Crazy In Love, Naughty Girl and last but not least... GIFT FROM VIRGO. IM HER NUMBER 1 FAN. TEXT ME IF YOURE AN QUEENBEY FAN
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book was just as good as Gone Girl. It took me on an emotional roller coaster as I started to really like and understand Camille. The fact that she is a cutter was just the surface. Excellent book can't wait to read more of her books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome read/great story line/lots of twists to keep your interest. Highly recommended.. emotionally charged. This book was constructed so well and the topics that it touched were not easy. Sky was so easy to like and so was Holder (Dean). The issues that were covered in this book are never easy and the way the author put it into a piece of fiction was tastefully perfect. I felt every emotion that was written in this book and there were a lot. I really don't want to mention the topics because I think that the way the book leads you it shouldn't be something you know about first. The story needs you to not know whats at the next turn. All I can say is WOW. I absolutely loved this book and I believe that it is something that young girls would also appreciate. The topics are strong but appropriate.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Always has a loose grasp on reality, but hey its a fiction for action entertainment. Good read. Enjoyed it for the chain of characters and action.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Hansel & Gretel is a fun movie, along the lines of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Not very serious films but entertaining.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|As always it is fast paced and intense excitement. Find the historical and mystery genre intriguing. Characters are pretty darned believable due to faults and shortcomings.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This a great movie! very funny but not a slapstick comedy.  Excellent cast!  Will definitely be seeing Red 2 when it comes out.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Loved this game did not take long to finish though would recommend to others hope to see more like it
B002MFULQO|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  It portrayed the American culture of the time very well, and presented all of the complicated factors surrounding the JFK assassination in a way that made it very understandable.
1452110581|5.0|bought this for my gran. she laughed so much she peed on the cat. cat thought it wasn't funny at all.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|ThePianoGuys did it again.<br />Another great album of creativity and quality music.<br />Also of note is that none of the songs from the first album made an appearance in the second so its totally new music (no reason not to get both).<br />As a fellow musician these guys are some of my favorites.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a very good read if you don't mind all the medical lingo. This should make the believer even stronger and the skeptic stand up and ask questions!
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I SAW THIS AT A MOVIE THEATER.  GREAT MOVIE!!  LOVED IT SO MUCH I JUST HAD TO BUY THE MOVIE FOR MYSELF.  GLAD I DID!
B008O9V4C2|4.0|His solo albums have a history of great story telling. This one is no different. Production is pristine. I am not a fan of &#34;Earl Cooke Jr.&#34;, and I feel Donald cut a corner with the engine of the group. Michael is a wonderful artist and musician. I'm simply use to hearing Bernard, or Steve Gadd, or The Human Metronome W/Soul Keith Carlock. Personal preference.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is too fun. I can honestly play it for hours. And the movie references are perfect! Props Gameloft.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Very entertaining show.  A good period piece that has all the elements of a good tv show:  drama, comedy, suspense.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun. I love playing it every time I get a chance. I also like that you have online stuff you can do too.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|show is really good, and because not too much carries over from episode to episode, you can watch these at your leisure
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Interesting reading as always for john Grisham.  I think Denzel Washington should play the lead character.  Will recommend this book to others.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun, challenging and addicting.  The controils are simple and the different courses all have their own challenges. Lots of variety.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is like angry gran run but a lot better. I really enjoy playing with my friends online too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really good read and incredibly hard to put down once you get started.  I'm looking forward to the next book!!
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|Gentle way to start the day. Yes you have to pay to get the future card. It helps support the developers.<br />Will still use it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Surprisingly, this is the best book I have ever read. The ending had me screaming. I can't WAIT for the movie.
0345803485|4.0|Ok, this normally isn't my thing; being something of a Hemingway man, but my wife talked so much about this book I had to give it a try.  It's the type of book you either love or hate.  It grabbed my attention and I found myself looking forward to bedtime so I could read some more of it.  It's a little predictable in places and sometimes just a little idealized, but overall it's a good entertaining read.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Love the entire series of Jack Reacher.  Would not have cast Tom Cruise in the movie though.  To small.  Nt the stature that the book describes.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Modernizes your old maglite, batteries last a really long time and it's much brighter.  The push button is nice because you can keep your preset focus.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Slow moving and convoluted.  Hated it.  Never finished.  There was no desire to find out where the wife went,  Refund?
B002ZG9846|5.0|I &#60;3 this movie, Nicolas Cage is actually good in it!!!  I can't wait for Kick Ass 2 to be released mid-August with an older, tougher Hit Girl!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I Really like this program, it has lots of choices of different sounds. It has numerous water sounds which are the ones I like best but plenty of other sounds. You can also mix the sounds.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner is targeted towards teens or rather adults who are you at heart. This novel kept me questioning and predicting what would happen at every turn. The comic relief paired with the dramatic affect made me only fall in love with the characters more. I teach 9th grade and every student who read this, could not put it down. When I began reading, I found myself doing the same thing. Amazing. So well put together. Thomas is my new hero and this just makes me more excited to keep reading this series.
B00CKJTOHO|3.0|It wasn't the best season that I've seen.  It was a little unbelievable. Will I still watch the next one? yes.
B004MPEFBE|5.0|OK. So. Here we are.<br /><br />I started into the Harry Potter phenomenon quite, quite late. Just about 6 months or so ago, in fact. I'm a Science Fiction fan, way more than fantasy or the \\"magic\\" genre. But.<br /><br />HP was such a big deal, that I got the books on my Kindle, more to just find out what the big deal was, more than anything. And read them. And they were so incredibly good and fun and disturbing, on so many levels, that I had to also see the movies.<br /><br />I've actually become quite a Harry Potter fan.<br /><br />So, let's get down to it, shall we?<br /><br />You have to understand that the movies need to be evaluated separately from the books. They are just not 100% true to the books. They can't be. You can't tell a 600 or 700 page book in 2 or 2.5 hours of screen time, you just can't.<br /><br />So, if we leave the \\"authenticity\\" issue to the side... this is another great film, in a series of great films.<br /><br />It really does, as all the Potter movies do, follow the basic story of the books. If you are an avid reader, you will see scenes you imagined in your head, acted out for you by the truly superb cast.<br /><br />But the films, by necessity, must be taken as a separate entity.<br /><br />This is another truly wonderful, excellent, superb addition to the Harry Potter film series.<br /><br />The one thing I really love is, the film makers, _knowing_ they would have to abridge and condense, are internally consistent with their version of Potter.<br /><br />I've become such a HP fan that I know the books well enough to, at least, go... \\"Wait, wait, wait... we missed a scene, didn't we?\\", or \\"Wait, that didn't happen in the book, did it?\\".<br /><br />But when you view the films and the books as separate entities... this film, as all the others, tells the true Harry Potter _story_ magnificently.<br /><br />All in all, I am, for myself, 100% thumbs up.so... it is NOT all THAT far off from the books. It's been condensed, of course; the books were, like, 700 pages... you just can't do that much in a film of 2 or 3 hours, of course they had to condense it somehow. But it does indeed follow the general plot of the books. It isn't so far off that it's like other films that took the name and then did something completely different.<br /><br />All in all, I am, for myself, 100% thumbs up.
B00DBSZ6ZC|3.0|Plenty of action thin plot... worth a $1.50 rental, but not worth buying for $15 or renting for $3 or $4 dollars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is tons of fun and great for all ages. Great way for me and my family to play together and have fun trying to beat each others scores.
1567184855|5.0|If you think death is the end - reconsider!  We are here to learn and perhaps have a better run the next time around!  This is well researched by Mr. Newton and documented - so very interesting.
B00164GDA0|5.0|Undoubtedly the best cast of adolescent boy actors ever assembled for a movie. Wil Wheaton and the late River Phoenix both give memorable performances in a movie that really reflects the era I grew up in.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is a great game for those who like a challenge. It is very much like Mist but can be completed in much less time. It is great for those who need to take a break from daily tasks.
B006S009IY|4.0|Really a good movie. Depp was excellent as J.M. Barry, although his Scottish accent comes and goes and Barry spoke with an upper class English accent anyway. The boys were excellent, especially Freddy Highmore. Kate Winslett is good, although her illness seems to come and go more or less in the moment. Just very enjoyable period movie. I think Barry would approve.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|OH MY GOD....!!! I dont like this at all, this is Useless...unistalling..!! What is this really??? Hate...dont even have all the levels
B000H3EPTM|5.0|This is for old time mystery fans. For those of you that haven't seen or heard about this movie it is a spoof on many very famous detectives of fiction - English and American.  I highly revommend it. Don't forget the popcorn. Be prepared to groan as well as laugh!
B0000844M8|5.0|Absolutly great, the grandchildren were enthralled, it took me back so many many years, THANK YOU  the film was so interesting, it was the start of the Born Free series, and is still going strong. If you have not watched it yetDO SO .
0887307280|5.0|Purchased this book as a gift but have had the opportunity to read it. It is a very informative book and I highly recommend it to everyone!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|it gives u all the information u need like what it feels like and what day it is and if were going to have storms or not
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is the  best for meditation , relaxation, yoga, sleep or whatever you would need background noise for - just about every sound is included.  I enjoy listening to the ocean sounds while I meditate.  I can even mix sounds together to customize sounds according to my mood at the time.  I am very happy with this app and have never regretted the purchase.  Thanks, for a great product.  Don't hesitate to buy it - a great deal.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love card games and I've played this one since i was 10 years old. Everyone i know plays this games. We have even played double solitarie. Its been in my life since i was a child and i will always love it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Wanted this so I could figure out things &#34;on the go&#34;.....it's great just to have....you never know when you'll need it and you're not near your home calculator!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I like youtube alot. It was free through Amazon and I love Amazon. I can download music for my laptop and my ereader. I like listen to music while i clean, when i', cooking or taking a shower but mostly when i'm laying in my bed quietly in my baby's arms.
B00BJO5SXK|4.0|It's obvious that Tyler The Creator doesn't give a f***. While Goblin probably was too raw and straight forward for most, \\"Wolf\\" is far more sophisticated. The beats kinda remind me of a slowed down \\"The Neptunes/Pharrell\\" production, the lyrics/messages in the songs are mostly great and relevant. I love Frank Oceans choruses on \\"Slater\\" and \\"Bimmer\\", which really blend in perfectly with Tylers raw lyrics. The album also kicks off great with the smooth piano-driven intro \\"Wolf\\" which blends into f*** bombs delivered by Tyler and the great \\"Jamba\\". Other standouts are \\"Awkward\\", \\"Answer\\", \\"48\\", \\"PartyIsntOver\\", \\"IFHY\\", \\"Rusty\\" and the great \\"Treehome95 feat. Erykah Badu\\". \\"Lone\\" is a great last song to this album... Good CD.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I've played the free online version so I knew I wanted the app because there are more levels and so I wouldn't have to restart every time I got on.<br /><br />This is a strategy game with three levels of difficulty plus challenge modes. The difficulties are appropriate for the level you select: Easy is easy, Normal is moderate difficulty and hard is difficult but not impossible.<br /><br />I like the Medieval theme and storyline as well as the fact that the heroes don't use up stars.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Most recent update causes th Facebook to crash before news feed ever loads. Really annoyed that they keep messing with a good thing.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I'd easily give this 5 stars if not the typos and misused words. I hate grammar errors in published fiction.<br />I liked the story very much. Stories about women who have gone through abuse -- both physiscal and emotional -- always touch me. Romantic, yet suspenful, the story keot my interest till the very end. Will be checking the second part when it comes out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i like this game a lot. its so real.  i play the game sometimes im getting gems for writtting this review :p
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Stay away.<br />Public toilets of Wacken Open Air rock/metal festival smell better than this crap.<br />If people are so porn hungry i advise them to watch porn.<br />No need to waste your time going through 500+ pages of nonsense.<br />Horrible writing, bad book, no plot, sex, sex, sex... I know what sex is, would you mind putting a plot in your \\"book\\"?
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The information provided by the Weather Channel app is good.  Finding the info is not always easy.  I miss the hour by hour forecast for the next 24 hours.  My work is readily affected by the weather.  If rain is predicted, I continually check the radar.  Before, the 24 hour forecast gave me an estimate as to when to expect problems.  Also, the notification for severe weather does not work on my Kindle or my smart phone.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Finally read the 3rd Robert Langdon book The Lost Symbol. The Masons and symbology in DC are covered.  I guessed some of the \\"secrets\\" part way through but still greatly enjoyed the book.  Although there is definitely some of history that was glossed over to fit the book I do realize that this is a work of fiction.  Once again though, for such a smart guy, the main character seems to be quite dense regarding things sitting right in front of him.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|An informative easy read. The author makes complex information simple and easy to understood. The nine experiments are very cool.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Mi is a great movie with great acting and strong plot.  There are many twists and turns that will keep you in the movie.  Give this movie a chance and you won't regret it.
0671578642|5.0|great - as with all of David Weber's books - trying to get a full set of hardback Honor Harrington books and the others from the Honorverse series
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Like the game Hidden Letters, I wasn't too sure how I'd react to it, but it ends up that I love it.  I'm addicted and even walk around now subconsciously looking for numbers on items around me.  I hope they come out with more games in this series.
0756655307|1.0|I grabbed this book for the first time to look up one of Marvel's seminal characters from both the golden age and silver age  --- The Sub Mariner.  No entry whatsoever.  The darned book has many hundreds of minor characters no one has heard about or even cares about, but no Sub Mariner.  Yikes.<br /><br />I also really dislike the look of the art.  Every character has the garbage modern comic book art and it sux.<br /><br />Not a useful reference for me, nor enjoyable to flip thru.<br /><br />Update: after looking more, I found the listing under NAMOR.  Not much of an entry and little mention of Sub Mariners exploits in the very first five years of Marvel books.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first season since I was late in watching this series and started with season two & three.  I was anxious to see the beginning so it would clarify  a lot of questions I had concerning this wonderful series.  I now look forward to more of this exciting series.<br /><br />The boxed set arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner. I am very satisfied with this purchase!
B004NELBPC|4.0|Can you please fix the slide show problems? When clicked, they go to an empty image icon. Other than that, this app has a perfect layout.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The car charger seems to work fine, though you have to push it really hard to get in, and pull very hard to get out.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|If you rate this as anything less than a 4 no offense you just don't understand the app...it doesn't extend battery life it details usage and time remaining while running specific apps/videos/games etc...WELL WORTH .99&cent; if you like to know how much juice you got left.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Nice to have his son in this one. I have all of the movies and this is just another Die Hard that rocks.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very quick \\"teaser\\" read packed with highlights of an amazing man's life. Definitely a springboard into learning more about Tesla and others who have shaped our world with their once outrageous visions.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent read. Maybe the best I have read all year. Beyond being an awesome love story, it is also a story about forgiveness and reconciliation. Again I LOVED IT.
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|If we are &#34;choosing sides&#34; about two of the original band members leaving vs Hayley's feelings about it, I'm on their side if what they said went down the way it did. However, if we're talking about music that expresses how someone gets over being hurt, no matter who's right or wrong, Hayley with the rest of the band turned out an amazing 17 track album. So diverse I didn't know what to think at first, but then, track by track, they all blew me away. Long time and new fans alike, buy this album!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|The characters are engaging and the plot is completely believable. Such a great read. Couldn't put it down. Another win for the author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my all time favorite game and now I can play it on my kindle and carry it with me everywhere.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I cannot get enough of the deftones, and they keep fueling my addiction!  Every song on this album is gold!  Just....pure gold!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like to play spider it is fun and I really enjoy it.  Everyone should try it and see how fun it is.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|Always have been a fan of Jeffrey Archer so I devour any thing I can get my hand on<br />Pp
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game really fun , I play it all day long ... really encourage you to download this game. Had no problems playing
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great mind game. Made you use your brain a lot more than others. Can&quot;t wait for the next room to open.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really enjoying the series.  The plot is good.  It seems that most USA series are spot on these days. Totally recommend it!!!
B00BDXJS7E|5.0|It took me a long time to make up my mind as to what rating I should give. The main reason for that was that this is an unusual book in many ways.<br /><br />The book is written in the form of a narration by the main character, or rather it is a dialogue but we never hear the words of the person he is talking to. What the second character is doing or saying is clear, but we learn that from the main character. We do not know who this other person is.<br /><br />At the end, the reader gets an inkling of what the other person may be or is about to do. But the reader has to come to their own conclusions. This is perhaps one attraction of the book, and for me the best one in that the reader has to think about what is being said and is happening and they may never know whether they have come to the right conclusions.<br /><br />The title of the book is also interesting. Because of the current climate the word fundamentalist conjures up the image of a a person who is very fundamentalist about their religion, more often than not Islam. The significance of religion to Changez, the main character is never referred to. He in fact, believes in other fundamentals. This can be a shock to the reader because the title could have led the reader to believe that the book could be an analysis of how an individual can become a religious fundamentalist.<br /><br />Mohsin Hamid is a very perceptive writer. There are very many themes intertwined in the narrative; what makes someone leave their country in Asia and become a successful employee in the United States; what are the adjustments and tensions for someone brought up in one culture and having to adapt to another one; what is it that brings about change in a person's thinking and values. There are many more.<br /><br />This is a book that is easy to read but unlike many other works of fiction, it leaves the reader wanting to go back as there are many questions that need to be asked, and answered. When a book does this to a reader, theauthor must be very talented.
B004NELBPC|3.0|I really enjoy reading your articles, but being forced to do so in portrait view drives me nuts! Holding my fire in landscape view is preferred. Please fix this!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome. It is very challenging. Some times I need a walkthrough or picture. Only twice though. Over all it's awesome. If you like the room, grizzly manor,or fun thinking games this is perfect.
B00DI75SWM|1.0|This Keep Calm Generator app is advertised as free in the product description but we're being charged $.99.  Am I the only one catching this? [[ASIN:B00DI75SWM Keep Calm Generator]]
B006QKJQM6|5.0|What an awesome movie. The cast of characters make up this great production with Jack Black taking center stage.<br /><br />GREAT!!!!!!!!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|This was a riveting, awesome movie. Sometimes pretty graphic but I can understand why he did the things that he did.I would recommend it to anyone who likes movies that are a little off the chart.
B008JFURKG|3.0|Every time a new sequel comes out, it pretty easy to question the driving force behind the reason it's made. Do most sequels need to be made? Naturally, the immediate response would be no, they don't NEED to be made. But, aside from food, water, and a handful of other things, we really don't NEED that much. Make no mistake, there isn't a sequel in the history of film that NEEDED to be made, but when it comes to sequels - it's all about the entertainment value, mixed with a desire to make a bang at the box office. Moviegoers see a good, possibly great film and want more. We didn't NEED The Godfather Part II, but it's difficult to imagine a world where it was never made. The same can be said about a slew of other sequels, like The Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, or Aliens. Quite honestly, sequels provide a simple desire to consume more of the same (with the hopes of it being better than or at least as enjoyable as the original). However, not every film deserves a sequel. It's an absolute rarity that a sequel will live up to the original, which is the reason sequels have a reputation of being inferior films. As all of this pertains to yet another comic book sequel, RED 2 - the question becomes: did this film really NEED to be made?<br /><br />Directed by Dean Parisot (Fun with Dick and Jane), RED 2 stars Bruce Willis who reprises his role as Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent attempting to live a normal life. Frank is still dating Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), but the relationship doesn't have the flavor it once did - you know, without the bullets flying through the air. As it turns out, Frank and Marvin (John Malkovich) have a mysterious hit put on them by MI6, which includes their old cohort, Victoria (Helen Mirren) and an ambitious assassin for hire, Han (Byung-hun Lee). It's another average day in the life of Frank Moses as this new adventure takes him and his \\"assailants\\" around the world to uncover the mystery known as \\"Nightshade\\" and save the globe from the usual nuclear threat of death and destruction. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Anthony Hopkins, Brian Cox, and Neal McDonough also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />It's no surprise that filmmakers continue to dip into the comic book \\"house of ideas.\\" After all, they provide for a pretty substantial stream of income for the parent company behind it. And, RED is no exception - even though it was a quick three issue \\"one-and-done\\" limited series (written by Warren Ellis). A film adaption for RED was not entirely unexpected. However, with it being such a brief story (leaving so little to lean on as far as characters and plot direction goes), it's a bit of a surprise that RED even had chatter about the possibility of a sequel. But, that's Hollywood.<br /><br />The first film was fun and quirky (as many films are in the action-comedy genre), yet it's difficult to decipher what more could be done with these characters on the big screen - hence the major issue with this sequel. If you watched RED 2 on a screen right next to RED, you'd basically be watching the same exact movie - only recycled. They both have an identical 2 hour running time, focus heavily on the relationship between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker's characters, and both rely on John Malkovich for comedic support. While the \\"retired and extremely dangerous\\" premise was amusing and entertaining the first time around, it's difficult to see the point of the sequel. Sure, it's entertaining - but it's literally a continuation of the same characters doing exactly the same things, only this time they're constantly bouncing from country to country at the snap of a finger. Eventually, the plot becomes clear - but all too predicable - yet the constant jumping from scene to scene (for the first hour or so) makes it difficult to keep track of who is doing what and which character is good or bad. Basically, they sacrifice plot for pointless explosions, cheap one-liners, and a mediocre car chase.<br /><br />Now that the nitpicking is out of the way, it should be noted that the good things about RED 2 certainly outweigh the fact that it's nothing more than a recycled version of the first film. From top to bottom, this cast is smart, funny, and full of chemistry. On his own, John Malkovich carries this film on his back as the slightly-crazed, overzealous side-kick, Marvin. His variety of facial expressions, not to mention his relationship advice, will keep the laughs flowing continuously. And, for some reason - every single time John Malkovich utters the name \\"Frank,\\" it's a chilling reminder of his role as Mitch Leary in the drama, In the Line of Fire. His co-stars, Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker, provide just enough interest themselves - bickering back and forth as they continue their unorthodox relationship. While Bruce Willis basically has the same role as the first film, Parker is no longer simply along for the ride. She's no CIA agent, but she's at least involved in the action and contributing much more than the last time we saw her. Speaking of action, Byung-hun Lee and his athleticism is always a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Overall, RED 2 is nothing more than an average action-comedy, using a silly recycled plot and masterful casting to provide a lighthearted, entertaining film. Still, there's very little that separates this film from previous flicks, like Austin Powers, Rush Hour, or Lethal Weapon. Although its predecessor was highly entertaining, RED 2 feels more like an unnecessary sequel that didn't NEED to be made, carrying no other intention than to make a typical studio money grab. Regardless, the plot's constant character misdirection will at least hold your attention and keep you guessing (at least for a while) about who's pulling the strings from the shadows. There's enough comedy, action, and nonsense to fuel this film for the full two hours without making it actually feel like a two hour film. It's entertaining, charming, and completely unrealistic - and oddly enough, absolutely worth the price of admission.<br /><br />GRADE: C<br />FNDNreview.coming is out of the way, it should be noted that the good things about RED 2 certainly outweigh the fact that it's nothing more than a recycled version of the first film.

0062255657|5.0|My wife is a huge Neil Gaiman fan and had recently bought and read this. I was looking for a new book to read and, based on her praise, selected the Ocean at the End of the Lane. This was probably not the best decision as it was later in the evening and I had to get up at 5:30 for work the next day. Needless to say, 12:15 am came around quickly as I was turning the last page.<br /><br />This, as advertised, is an adult fairy tale. Not in the Sookie Stackhouse or Weaveworld sense, where it's full of adult themes, sex, horrific imagery and deceit. It's overall theme is that no matter how old and grey and haggard we get, much like a nesting doll, we are still the children we were so long ago on the inside.<br /><br />We have the story of a man, not \\"old\\" per se, but his children have grown and much of his life has been lived. On the day of a funeral, he finds his mind drifting back to simpler times. Caught up by nostalgia and driving aimlessly, he finds himself arriving at the old lane where he used to live. He is compelled to visit an old neighbor to see if the family, he was once close to, still occupies the farm. The mother of a childhood friend greets him, warily at first, and invites him in for tea. When he wanders off to visit a duck pond on the property, that he recalls his friend used to refer to as \\"the Ocean\\", long forgotten memories come flooding back. What follows is a fantastic ride, lifting the veil of our perceived reality to the beauty and horror beneath.<br /><br />It's no surprise that this book is well written. Neil Gaiman has proven his writing skill time and time again. The story is touching, sad, happy and nostalgic. Neil expertly puts you back into your mind as a child when adults were all big, strong and infallible. What I find frequently irritating in books is when authors take a 200 page story and try to inflate it into a 500 page novel. This book is perfect at 192 pages. Neil lets it be as long as it needs to be and it's refreshing. Another success is the autobiographical nature of the book. It's interesting to wonder and discuss which parts may have been taken from Neil's life. For a story steeped in fantasy it's all very real.uccess is the autobiographical nature of the book.

B00005UWMX|5.0|I bought this disc 2nd hand and was not disappointed. This is the second disc that I've bought from this seller and all's good. As to the film, I think it's wonderful. It could have been a lot more brutal, seeing as it happens in &#34;the olden times&#34; medieval Europe, but it was done excellently and delicately. Mathew Broderick as a young man is very good and is the main character in this film. I also liked the music - even though at first it might seem a bit strong it is completely fitting to the film. In short - a very good film!

B00915G6R6|3.0|I love THE GOOD WIFE.  Season One is one of the best seasons of television, period.  And the best thing about this show has always been the relationship between Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) and Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi).  Unfortunately, two decisions made by the writers have irreparably damaged this relationship, and consequently the series.  First, at the end of Season Two the writers decided to reveal that Kalinda slept with Alicia's husband during her stint at the State's Attorney's office two years before the show began.  This undermined the friendship that had grown between these two very different women.  And second, in Season Four, they brought in new character Nick (Marc Warren), Kalinda's long-lost abusive husband.  This guy shows up in the first episode of Season Four as a thug with a criminal record attempting to use Lockhart Gardner to help him get a towing contract from the State.  But his real motive is to move in on Kalinda again and get his hands on some money he believes she stole from him.<br /><br />The problem here is that Kalinda has always been portrayed as a strong and self-sufficient woman.  Yes, she was \\"mysterious,\\" and it was obvious from the start that she had secrets she was hiding, but it seems totally against character to portray her locked in a love-hate battle with an abusive lunatic.  While things are left a bit murky as to what Kalinda's relationship with Nick really is, they are shown punching each other, going full-on martial arts with each other, pulling guns on each other, and having what can only be called sadomasochistic sex with each other.  In fact, their first \\"sex scene\\" looks very much like rape, although it is left up in the air as to whether or not Kalinda was into the whole rape scenario.<br /><br />This storyline permeates the first half of Season Four, and the first ten episodes are undeniably marred by its presence.  By mid-season, however, the writers seemed to get it (fans were not happy), and Nick was abruptly written out (although his story was left open-ended).<br /><br />I didn't really begin enjoying Season Four until episode 11 (\\"Boom De Yah Da\\"), which is the first without Nick's appearance.  There's also a great scene in that episode between Alicia and Kalinda that recalls their relationship in the first two seasons.  Julianna Margulies has said that she herself could never forgive a friend who had done what Kalinda did (sleeping with Peter), and I think the writers have been influenced by her feelings about the storyline.  That's unfortunate, since I've missed the Alicia/Kalinda friendship and hope to see it get back on track in Season Five.<br /><br />There are some good characters in Season Four, including the return of Louis Canning (Michael J. Fox), Elsbeth Tascioni (Carrie Preston), and Mike Kresteva (Mathew Perry).  Notable new additions include Clarke Hayden (Nathan Lane), a trustee appointed to help Lockhart Gardner avoid bankruptcy, and Maddie Haywood (Maura Tierney), a wealthy woman who befriends Alicia and then becomes competition for Peter.  THE GOOD WIFE has always been adept at using guest stars to great advantage, and Season Four is no exception.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of the series (and I most definitely am), you won't want to miss Season Four.  There's plenty of drama as Lockhart Gardner tries to survive an impending financial crisis, and Peter's run for the governorship is equally compelling. Just be aware of the weak first half.  I'm also disappointed in the writers' decision to continue with the on-again-off-again Alicia/Will romance.  While believable, a romantic relationship between these two characters makes Alicia seem weaker, and more vulnerable to the same kinds of things she dealt with in her marriage to Peter.  That said, the conflict in Alicia's mind between her very understandable sexual attraction to Will and her commitment to her husband and children is compelling.  The final moments of Season Four set up ascenario for Season Five that may or may not mean she has finally chosen one path over the other - but the writers leave it brilliantly inscrutable.  Will Alicia jump back into a passionate liaison with Will, or will she recommit to Peter and her family?  It's a delicious dilemma, and I, for one, can't wait!<br /><br />First half of Season Four:  2 stars<br />Second half of Season Four:  4 stars<br />Overall:  3 starsscenario for Season Five that may or may not mean she has finally chosen one path over the other - but the writers leave it brilliantly inscrutable.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|My first Neil Gaiman novel. The imagination of this book is magic but darker than I usually enjoy.  The characters and story seemed fleeting which I think must be by the author's choice.  Entertaining times. Would recommend. Plan to check out his other novels.
B003G4W49C|1.0|Intro was page after page of &#34;fan letters&#34; from people who thought they were just like Ender, beyond brilliant, unappreciated, unloved, couldn't make friends because of their brilliance, whine, whine, whine. Intro was a huge turn off.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I bought this book on a whim, not caring if I liked it or not, it was inexpensive. Once I started reading I finished the book in two settings. It kept me hoping for the best and even nervous at times. Glad I got the book, it was the first book I bought when I received my Kindle as a present. Looking for more books by Andy Weir.  High Five Mr Weir!!!

B0064X7FVE|2.0|The new update with its clever (read: annoying) balls of weather is a horrible update. Not nearly intuitive as the older version. I have to really search around for what I'm looking for, ex: trying to get more details on a day; and then trying to figure out how to go back, which on my Kindle doesn't seem very responsive.<br /><br />Why is the order of section Map, Now, Videos, Forecast??  Shouldn't you group Now and Forecast??? Strange.<br /><br />Go back, I say. Less  pretty colors, but at least I can figure out the weather.<br /><br />And there should also be an option to turn on/off having the info show up in the header and in the quick access swipedown menu.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love The Hunger Games! The books are exciting,intense and keep you on your toes.  The movie followed very close to the serirs and Jennifer Lawrenceis exceptional as Katniss Everdean.  I can't wait for the next movies to come out.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I bought this only hoping it would work.  My job bought me a new MacBook Air and I did not want to have to bring the charger back and forth to work and home so considered buying another charger, which was quite expensive.  I have a MacBook at home so wanted to use that charger but of course it would not work.  So I bought this not knowing if it would work or not and it does.  It is great!!!!!!

B008XKSW7M|4.0|Usually when a movie has this many A-list stars the movie is medicore at best. The movie usually has so many stars because the storyline is bad or the concept of the whole movie is bad. But this movie really delivers. It is funny, happy, sad, and just down right enjoyable. Before I saw it I had heard so so reviews about it, but I really feel lik it's a movie you should give a chance.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This CD with Lindsey Stirling's music was wonderful.  Two copies were purchased - one for my daughter (as a gift) and one for me.

We look forward to the next CD produced with Lindsey Stirling's music.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Old version was much better. This one is not as descriptive. I am considering removing it. I don't use this version.
034554398X|4.0|Okay, so I never read fantasy. Like, never. I mean, I read The Hobbit in the sixth grade because it was required. Since then, nothing.<br /><br />But I got hooked on the HBO series for Game of Thrones. I watched the first two seasons on Netflix and then I suffered through the Facebook updates of people watching the third season. But I don't have HBO. So I decided to read the third book instead.<br /><br />It amuses me to listen to debates about whether George R.R. Martin is a \\"good\\" writer. This seems to mean very different things to different people and readability (as evidenced by popularity and awesome sales) isn't always enough. I wonder if some people put the writing down specifically because of its broad appeal. The fact that it's accessible to a majority means it can't be \\"good\\". For these readers, a book is only \\"good\\" when indecipherable to most.<br /><br />For me, it was in one of the first chapters of A Storm of Swords, when a low-speed sailboat chase had me on the edge of my seat, that it occurred to me that I was in the hands of a \\"good\\" writer. Martin's technique of killing off lead characters isn't a risk most writers are willing to take and it definitely ups the stakes. I also love the fact that these characters are so complicated. Morality is murky here and virtue often does not achieve external reward - much like in real life. Perhaps that realism is why I'm able to enjoy a book about dragons and magic. The fantasy elements are superficial; at its root, this is a story about people, relationships, and human nature.<br /><br />-Katie O'Rourke, author of Monsoon Season

0385349947|5.0|As a friend put it: &#34;Any self-respecting woman should read this book at some point in their life.&#34; Sandberg introduces valid issues faced by working women and illustrates how some men do (and should) care about the issues because they all have mothers/wives/sisters/daughters who have to face the same things in life. She cites credible studies and does a good job discussing what we need to do to change the social &#34;norms.&#34;

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too bad of a game though it is a lot like 100 floors. It is challenging,  but no so challenging that it takes forever to complete a level. All in all a good game.
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|From the moment I saw the trailer I knew this movie was going to be a waste of time, but I was wrong in the past. Not this time. This movie was boring and predictable. No horror, only gratuitous gore. It was serious one moment, then comical the next. It was Evil Dead, then it tried to be The Exorcist.  This was one of those movies that when you ask a friend \\"how was it?\\" They reply \\"The effects were good\\". When will film makers learn that good SPFX cannot replace a good story. The original proved that. Even the short film Sam Raimi made called  \\"Within the Woods\\" that the original ED was based off of was better. I guess Sam Raimi & Bruce Campbell just told the people who made this boring film to put their name on it just to get a pay check. Next time I'll watch my old VHS copy of the original.

B004N6369Y|4.0|Books are not always exciting but good reads for chick lit lovers. I recommend this book for a quick read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It is such an honest portrayal of life and I felt immediately connected to it. You will be moved and touched by this book!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. I'd full of a lot of suspense,I also play it on my home computer.I am a big fan of hidden objects games.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like these style of games that make you think.  I wish it was harder, put overall pretty cool. Add hardness setting so you can go back and play first 10 rooms, have more things to find to complete.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love you gave out buckets and animal spawner eggs but please make monster spawners next please and give out bedrock in creative to.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use it daily. It keeps my tablet free of junk files and empty folders. It has a very good task manager and uninstaller and I am very pleased with this application. My tablet operates much faster!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very challening and lots of fun. Even my 8 year old daughter enjoys playing this game. And it's a free app!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I need to use this app more and get familiar with it. Every web browser offers Evernote as an extension. It is a great web page clipper that does a fantastic job and I tend to forget its there. This app will be around a very long time. Updates get better and better.
075669812X|5.0|This was purchased for a 7 year old ninja go fan!  With lots of pictures and detailed information about all ninja go characters - it is a great reference for kids who love all things ninjago!  The little figurine is a nice touch!
0393327345|5.0|Could not put it down! I absolutely love this novel. Most of the plot consists of rising action, so you can only imagine what that might be like...<br /><br />It's thrilling, interesting, dark, and sometimes confusing, but this is an amazing read that I would recommend to anyone!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game!! I couldn't put it down. I hope Fireproof Games comes out with more like it soon. Loved it.
B00CDUVDEC|1.0|I went into this very open minded. I knew there wouldn't be another Pantera, I will never expect that to be. I was so hoping that Phil's solo project would be somewhere towards that kind of quality. Sadly I was disappointed. Normally when songs on an album gel together it's a good thing. However here, they gel because they sounds the same. There is nothing in here that hints towards his talent. The lyrics are juvenile and the music, if you want to call it that, is all over the place in a bad way. He should have just talked instead of scream.<br /><br />Maybe after 10 more listens it will grow but that's what I thought about SJR. As somebody who loves Pantera and Down. Phil is better off with people he can write and collaborate with. On his own, he just shouldn't.<br /><br />Stay with Down, Phil.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|Not as fluid as her earlier work.  You won't be disappointed, just not wowed.  I'm looking forward to her next CD.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book keeps you on the edge of your seat! I could not put this book down! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed The Hunger Games trilogy. Can't wait to buy the next book in this series!
B000AR9YQ4|5.0|It's ashame he didn't get more airtime here in the states.  More than I can bare caused me to purchase.  Basia in the background was a plus.  You won't be disappointed.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate the newest update. Not only is it difficult to navigate,  but all of the ads are insufferably annoying. If I wanted to see commercials I would turn on the TV.  The old ap was simple without all the bells and whistles and it worked!! Please,  at least give us the option to choose the version we want to use.
B004I9CXHW|1.0|I should have known from the other ratings (seems pretty much a coin flip) but this one didn't work.  Really didn't even attempt to work, I guess I will just pay the extra cash from the dealer.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It can't be beat. Works great, smart and intuitive. Learns your fingers as best as you could imagine. Highly recommended.
B001YV502C|5.0|This film was a nice surprise when I first saw it years ago.a stark gritty view of our world in the very possible near future.hard to say much without spoilers, but overcrowded cities, xenophobia, and many other maladies combine to create something worth watching for a change.the story does take place in england,but could happen anywhere! Definitely Althea a look, don't pass it by.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|i enjoy the show very much. it has great character depth for each one. each episode can make me laugh and surprise me.
B007704HO6|4.0|Loved this book. For those who like animals is a delightful book!<br />It touched my heart. I really want to read the other ones.
B0044RC12A|5.0|This show is wonderful.  I can relate with the characters.  They have friends who help them through problems.  At times the show is funny.  I have watched this series more than one time.  I have the complete series.  Just sit back and relax and enjoy this wonderful show.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|Great seller, Great film, Fast shipper. The orginals what could be not better. Reminds you of why so many us still follow all the movies and TV programs.
B006YMLE7G|5.0|This is my favorite romance movie of all time, animated or otherwise.<br />*Warning: Not your traditional romance film. Flanders sucks.
B005KR6NS6|5.0|best tango movie...sally potter is a wonderful artist...and the music is fantastic. so glad they finally put it on dvd
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I had never heard of this story from Jane Austen until this version came out.  I fell in love with it.  I had to have it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great horse game app. Graphics are pretty realistic. You don't have to spend money to get a good experience out of the game. Highly recommended!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I don't understand all the hate for this movie.  I hope they will make a continuing story.  I love the actors in this movie
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Love the CD....Great singer and great songs...If you love country music you need to buy this CD....I'll be buying more of his music for sure.
B005TBN04S|4.0|Was a good movie in the series. I think they tried to hard to out do the first which it failed at.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just love this series.It has everything I want :a soap operish plot,a history lesson, very funny lines(almost all by Maggie Smith),an understanding of society and it's changes after WWI and several very big surprises.
B00B2270P8|5.0|Was an excellent series and kept you waiting for more. If you don't know this series, you've been living under a rock.
B001UAPVDU|5.0|Simply a must have for any of Lady Gaga's Loyal Monster Subjects! Lady Gaga began her reign as Queen with this CD as far as I am concerned with &#34;Just Dance&#34; and &#34;Poker Face&#34;!!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|At one place the DVD &#34;sticks&#34;, but it plays well except for that one problem.  Brave is a pretty movie & it is nice that the female heroine is not delicate & overdressed as are so any of the Disney heroines
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I read a few reviews before watching this movie and one said that they learned from the first one and got it right this time. I hadn't seen the first one and so was hoping this would be entertaining.  I could understand why Stallone and Arnold would be in this but Willis and Li I thought would have better judgement.  At least LI jumped out the movie early on which was a very smart move on his part.  This movie was just action for action sake, an inane and unexplained series of people showing up unexpectedly to save the day.  I couldn't finish watching it.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|My 13-year-old son and I enjoyed this movie tremendously. An immensely likable cast and sincere warmth bring the story to life (couldn't resist the pun) with no cloying. I had avoided this film for months based on the premise: Teenage undead falls for the post-apocalyptic zombie resistance leader's daughter. The filmmakers pulled it off brilliantly. What a fun, funny, and kind-hearted film.
1451624468|5.0|A Universe from nothing is a spellbind book, it open your eyes to the new reality of a beautiful Universe where our blue planet is located I love it. Is a brilliant book which explores what happen when the Big Bag create the Universe, the moment without yesterday A really knockdown book...
B00447G2PM|4.0|Good 3D movie! Wish it were a bit longer...but would recommend it anyone who has a love for the ocean.
B004N62KTG|5.0|The lyric to this mega hit is printed on the front inside cover, which makes a very nice touch to having it in your Lady Gaga CD collection! The remixes are great to mix in with music for parties and great for exercising too; or play them to CELEBRATE WHO YOU ARE!!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved the stage play & this movie is excellent.  I do wish that the director had recorded the songs in a studio, but Les Miserables is still a wonderful movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son and I love this game.  It is very easy to play and who doesn't love the minions?  I highly recommend this game.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I love his style, but in this novel he lost his way with his characters.  Too much time spent on characters in Greece which could have been handled within a few pages.  He should have expanded the stories of the two Pari(s) instead.  Good read but not as good as his first two novels
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|beautiful graphics fun game easy to play and very fluid.<br />Only downsides- sometimes it's difficult to tell whats going on in all the jumble of enemies and powerups, and you can't skip to new levels you always start in the same place.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We are HUGE Downton Abbey fans...loved this season and can't wait for the next season to start!! Goooo Crawley family!!
1781162646|4.0|I've been reading Stephen King for about 30 years now and bought this book in &lt;gasp> actual book form when I couldn't get it on my Kindle. I read it in 2 days and did not want it to end. I was completely transported to the world that King created, and was totally sold on all of his characters, from the protagonist heartbroken Dev to his landlady Ms.Shoplaw to his girl \\"friend\\" Annie. I was a rube for Joyland, to say the least. Similar in feel to his short stories \\"The Body\\" or \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" or even his collaboration with Peter Straub \\"The Talisman\\", this novel engages with a great story that touches your heart, captivates your mind and makes those little hairs on the back of your neck stand at attention. Read this book; it's amazing - a fantastic tale from a master storyteller at the top of his game.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This has to be the most unusual and weird book I have read. The story as told by each - a husband & wife who are both crazy, manipulative, liars. By the end I had really hoped they would kill each other. Didn't happen, tho. I will say the author has a vivid imagination.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|love this game and now my kids are playing as well. very fun and addictive game. lots of fun and enjoy
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book makes fascinating reading, especially for those who wonder where the \\"national obesity epidemic\\" came from.  For a long time, I toyed with the idea that giving up smoking might have been one of the causes: we all know people who have quit smoking and \\"porked right up,\\" as a friend put it.<br /><br />But I think that Taubes is much closer to the mark.  He seems to have biology on his side.  I am no expert and no doctor, but it seems to me that his research supports Atkins 100 percent.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Okay, so the movie turned me on to the book, but the book is, as usual, so much more.  I like the characterizations, I love the nested doll structure, the way the worlds were linked together and was drawn into each of them.  David Mitchell did a superb job.  I was even impressed with his use of dialect.  My only criticism would be that the two pieces that were novels had a slightly different tone in the first and second presentations.  Good Read!
B009HELT3C|5.0|You can't go wrong with this franchise.  I must say that I was a bit more than worried about this 3rd MIB and how it would turn out. But, I loved it and how they tied the whole storyline together in the end...its a keeper!
B007SNFTAI|5.0|Difficult to put into words,the feelings this booked has evoked within me.  It was me in so many different and not so different ways.  I Don,t have children but I would give them this book if I did.  Thank you Mr. Ford ......this is a classic in every sense
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I recommend this or any of Alex's movies. He has a strong christian story in every movie. While fireproof focuses on being a better spouse. This movie focuses on being a better Father. All wrapped into a good story line with decent acting.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|I had the original recording on vynal & now i can listen to it anytime. I can even listen to it in the car......
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Starts out easy and gets progressively harder to complete the puzzles.  I would recommend this for all adults as well as kids.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who said that this movie reminded them of earlier Stargate episodes. The old team dynamic is there, and it was so refreshing to see General Hammond for the last time (before his real death) as well. This movie helped to really wrap the series up once and for all. As a fan of the show who owns every single episode, it left me with a great feeling at the end.
0307730700|5.0|A little slow in the beginning but a very well written book. I would recommend it highly. Very touching, I cried a lot.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Saw a few of them on television. It was superior. Loved this series too. Made me a fan of this series.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Absolutely hilarious!  Sedaris' writing and comedic timing are spot-on and delivered in such a way that, while wiping the tears of laughter from your face, yo are endeared to every member of his family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it because its super awesome I like how u are in the lab and then u go outside and u have victor and this girl that sells cookies and u have to beat them they shot things and u have to beat them but this is a cool game get it.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Love this movie that why I purchase to have on my kindle. It is a good movie for ladies to watch. Most men would not enjoy this movie. I love the story and how it turn out.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Beautifully captured with richly hued cinematography, starring the frail Isabella Adjani as the perfect embodiment of a Preraphaelite heroine. More tragic than creepy, unlike what I expected. I'm looking forward to seeing many more of Herzog's films.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so amazing, I can't think of words to describe it. It's such a good read and worth every penny. It's now one of my favorites. I highly recommend it.
B0001I561E|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my grandchildren, as they had just been in a theater group and had just finished their performance.<br />When I ordered it, delivery was scheduled for 7 business days. It arrived 3 days later!<br />Everyone enjoyed this fun classic Disney.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|it is great finished in hour. it is the best.play it. you need to play it.no life without playing it.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|All the awesome beats you would expect from daft punk, and as usual, sounds great. As a fan of daft punk, dead mouse, and other such music, I highly recommend this album.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Good action movie if you're bored and some stars from the past who we've grown to live but overall the movie was just average but I did have some good laughs its definitely worth a viewing for the fun aspect
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The thing I love most about this movie is that is is filmed in Pittsburgh. Love seeing all the shots of the town and especially the Heinz Field with all the Steeler fans. It's was great to see the field being blown up (on screen only) Entertaining movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome me and my daughter like this game and her sister  it might be hard to play but not really but the trains get in the way.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It was a great book  because it's so well written, and I recommend it for everyone. I have no complaints about it.
B00D4PDJMY|1.0|I was looking to this album as I enjoy all types of metal music and have enjoyed most of the other stuff Anselmo has been involved in.  I've been a huge fan ever since Pantera's Power Metal album came out.  As Pantera and other bands evolved into more aggressive style's, my tastes changed as well.  I've bought a bunch of new CD's lately: Amon Amarth, Children of Bodom, Battlecross, etc.  This is not even going to get a second listen.  I put it in with high expectations.  The first song sounded like an intro and I was waiting for it to kick in but it never did.  The second song started better but also never grew into anything.  Overall, this is very monotonous and noisy.  There  really isn't a musical moment on it.  I hate to say it, but it is pure garbage.  I tried to listed to it a second time while working out but didn't even make it through the second song.  It may go in the trash.
B003K15IF8|5.0|Although actually nothing specials happens in the life of William Stoner, a lot of things do happen and they keep you with the book every page. As a reader, you witness the development of his life.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I suffered through every minute of this so-called \\"movie.\\"  Deathproof is the cinematic equivalent of a bowel movement heated in a microwave for two hours.  Think of what that would smell like and you'll understand how much this movie stinks.<br /><br />If it achieves anything, it achieves the perfect visual marriage of boringness, stupidity, vapidness, meaninglessness and worthlessness.  So congratulations on succeeding at that.<br /><br />I mean EVERYTHING about this movie stinks.  Even the \\"hot girls\\" in the movie are major let downs.  Bad actresses playing vapid so-annonying-you-hate-'em characters is NOT a good combination.  And the \\"bad guy\\" is so lame, and he's hardly in the movie at all, which I guess is a good thing.  In fact, any of the characters NOT being in this movie would have been a good thing, because they are all so unlikable and annoying.  This is just an utterly worthless movie that's NOT funny, exciting or entertaining even one tiny bit at any point.  This movie is just BORING.<br /><br />If anything I've said about this movie makes it sound remotely interesting, I apologize for misleading you.  Instead of watching this movie, burn it.  Or give it to your worst enemy.  Just don't suffer through it.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Almost went with 3 stars for it not having a lot of replay value on single player, but multiplayer should be funner.<br /><br />This game doesn't really need many instructions. Its self explanetory. For those complaining of getting deadlocked, they're not using the special abilities you get.<br /><br />This is a clone of a different game that was done better, but I can't think of the name of that one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app and I like the movie I can not put my kindle down I like it so much
0140282033|5.0|It is as if you can taste the chocolates and are in the shop, life and chocolates bring you fulfillment.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watching this series connects us with an earlier time in history. In the process we can peer safely at some of the same issues about a time of change and the changes required of different folks in a family during such points in history. I am not sure that we are not going through another such change at the current time.  I am most impressed with how well the writers capture the tension and feelings of the different characters in their roles, status and even gender issues.  Some of the death departures appear a bit contrived but they do manage to tie them to the overall story.  It is a reminder of how it is to live in a small place with and without money.  Highly recommend it
B00BE97ONM|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Jams N. Roses (James Ross) and was pleasantly surprised by the near minimalist style. Fast paced with just enough info to keep the reader turning the page - perfect.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice game for the mind and the time good clean fun and very enjoyable I had a lot of fun and it helps . PASS the time as i try to figure out the codes and secrets
B008LV8TSU|5.0|It is a novel and unexpected story. I enjoyed the fantasy that is created by the characters. The story is one you can't predict.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|In a word...Addicting! It challenged me, but did not frustrate me. I was excited every time I discovered something new. For those who can't figure out how to start YouTube can help.
B00DI75SWM|4.0|This app is perfect for any creative soul full of inspiring and hilarious quotes and words of wisdom. You can share your creation on social media sites and with friends. It's great for getting what you have to say out there.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|My kids and I were having a great time with this app. There's a screen where Ben the dog mixes test tubes of liquids together with funny results. You can do two test tubes at a time, but there's a button that you can push to get more test tubes. DON'T DO IT! Once I pushed it, it wanted me to buy stuff (including a paid version of the app) to get more test tubes. Of course, I declined, but now, whenever we try to play the test tube game, it goes directly to the screen to buy stuff. Seems rather underhanded to me, and certainly took the fun out of Talking Ben for me.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|I have most of Mr. Winter's previous material. This CD hits it out of the park in my opinion.<br />If you are NOT a pure blues lover you may not fully appreciate his work on this CD. The material selected truly represents the essence of the &#34;blues&#34;.
B006ZN7KMM|5.0|This is a spectacular product, I recommend to others who are looking for this type of product. the seller is very satisfied with their delivery.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Classic Hitchcock.  One of C. Grants best movies.  Constant action.  Scenes from downtown New York City to the Black Hills
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great story told in a great way.  My hat is off for the author. If you like WWiI true stories, this is a must read.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|If someone with this lifestyle can excel and end up where Mr. Bourdain has, is there not hope for us all?
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I actually got this because my Kindle Fire stopped charging. I tried wiggling the wire and holding, but nothing worked. Anyway, this wire is pretty durable and reliable and long. I tend to plug it into my laptop which I move a lot and it still continues to charge. I charge my smartphone with it, too. The only problem is that I still have to wiggle the wire to get the kindle to charge.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. I like it because it gets harder as you go. I recommend you get this game. Plus it is free!!!
B008JFUQ16|5.0|I love this movie it's perfect for kids of all agesit's a really good movie all your kids will love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love it so far! the minions are adorable and it is a nice change of pace from temple run.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is a great game!!! It is so much fun to play - challenging but without being frustrating. There are so many levels and alternatives that you can still have fun even after finishing the main scenario.  Kudos to the developers for their congratulatory message at the end. To their &quot;Thanks for playing our game&quot; my reply is &quot;My pleasure. Thanks for making it.&quot;
B00CW665VI|5.0|I found Tangled to be refreshing, witty and super hot! Emma Chase had me hooked from the first sentence. The plot is the usual - he's a rich, successful love 'em & leave 'em jerk who finally meets someone worth his time. I found that it's in the way it's written that makes this storyline work. Told completely from Drews POV was great and it definitely made it more humorous. Its written as if Drew is sitting down with you telling you the story about what happened. I found Tangled to be like a great chocolate cake, you want to savor it but you can't seem to get enough and end up consuming it in no time. It is that steamy and funny that I couldn't put it down. If you're after a funny yet sexy read I would highly recommend it!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Easy to handle and complete challenges.<br />Love the graphics and music.  Colorful entertaining scenes. Integrative and quite user friendly especially on my Kindle Fire.x
B005544V6A|4.0|I was introduced to this program by my brother-in-law a while back. I was really excited to discover that Amazon Prime has this available to watch! Great show with lots of humor for everyone. My one drawback is the amount of strong language they use. Other than that, very enjoyable show!
B000YABS8E|4.0|A fish out of water, caught in a time warp comedy. The innocence of the main character surrounded by other crazy characters, including his parents was something to keep someone laughing throughout the picture. Again hilarious.
0316777722|5.0|My first experience with Mr. Sedaris and I'll be back for more.  Very very funny stuff.  Got this one after seeing him on the Daily Show, which was also hilarious.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|The app will no longer load. I have submitted numerous emails and problem tickets more than 5 days ago. No response. Bad customer service. Had to contact my regular sellers directly. Ebay if u actually read these: you are losing money and soon will lose an active customer. Fix you app.
B002M9WW30|3.0|I was very pleased with this purchase until I got to the fourth and fifth sixth blu-rays they would not play at all. However I contacted Amazon and they refunded half of the purchase price. I am still hoping to find those movies at a good price to be able to complete the collection.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game because it is a completion between friends and its compatible with facebook so try this game.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book looked at why and how we Americans go hooked on salt, sugar and fat delving into our needs to satisfy our taste buds and our brains.  You will look at all food in a different light after reading this book
B00DW39B2K|4.0|When two powerful actors of our time star in a movie, there is no doubt that you have to watch it. The acting is nothing short than great on either side, DeNiro vs. Travolta, but I didn't dig the story that much. Never the less, it is a good movie and definitely worth watching. If you have seen and liked movies like Sleuth, either [[ASIN:B00005R24G 1972 version]] or the [[ASIN:B0019F5DCU 2007 remake]], then you will like this one as well. DeNiro is truly at home and comfortable with his well-known grumpy yet intelligent attitude, while Travolta has taken a different yet challenging role. Honestly, I cannot say more about this movie without ruining it for you, since it is really a two man movie, so I just end my mini review here. Enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very ADDICTIVE and fun. Just love the minions. Had some fun while playing and did not want to stop.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|you can just buy the real one you can do every thing its only 3.99$ its lower than minecraft so just buy the paid one you can do all! and fee u don't have 15 mind or what ever u can play as long as you want :)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was so enjoyable that I would stay up late reading, and was humored by my sleepiness the next day, knowing that I would do the same thing (reading) late the next night. I could understand the motives of each of the characters, and particularly enjoyed the surprises.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|it is a really fun game. if u r into mind boggle games or if u like angry birds this game id for u.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|I was very pleased with the condition of this DVD it is like new and  the gal that  played the part is a great dancer In Dancing With The Stars..
B0064X7FVE|1.0|what happened to the old app.was much better.please bring it back. the upgrade is terrible. it freezes a lot and wont run.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I don't care for the card face, it is too overwhelming and distracts from play.  Also board layout is the same :(
B005COO1X6|3.0|This was a fine story. No real surprises, but a pleasant read. I could see the 2 or 3 characters at the end expanding into another story/novel. It isn't scary or really very suspenseful, but King is a good storyteller so I still enjoyed seeing the story unfold.
B002J301NM|5.0|Well written and acted. The scenes with Perry encountering his hispanic in-laws is very funny (I've been there!). Give it a try!

B00BEIYMAG|4.0|\\"Insidious\\" made over $54 million domestically on a $1.5 million budget and became the highest grossing film of 2011. Director James Wan knows how to be thrifty with his filmmaking that isn't time consuming yet still pays off for the audience. However, with \\"Insidious: Chapter 2\\" coming out this September and Wan being announced as the director taking over \\"Fast & Furious 7\\" with a July 11, 2014 release, people may be a little sick of the director in the coming months. \\"The Conjuring\\" should be on your radar though, especially when early buzz for the film was so positive Warner Bros bumped the film from its original early 2013 release to the middle of the summer blockbuster season. While \\"The Conjuring\\" may not be the terrifying masterpiece the promo material is making it out to be, it's still an incredibly atmospheric and tense experience.<br /><br />The film begins with the Warrens investigating a possessed doll moving around on its own. It's revealed that the doll is the vessel for an inhuman spirit, which is actually quite demonic. The opening credits then slowly crawl across the screen; simple yellow text that scrolls up on a black background yet somehow still feels ominous. You then witness the Perrons move into the farmhouse and their financial woes slowly bubble to the surface. The supernatural occurrences take the snowball effect and start off small before increasing in size and strength. Little things are introduced like the dog not wanting to go inside, cobwebs, the house always being cold, and the clocks stopping at 3:07am. The film's minimal use of music only adds to the tension. The events begin to escalate with legs being pulled during sleep, house creaks, footsteps, doors banging lightly on their own repeatedly, and sleepwalking. Things are taken a step further with the hide and clap game, which you've probably seen from the trailer, doors slamming shut on their own, and the bruises appearing on Carolyn's body.<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\" doesn't rush anything, which is one of its strengths. The first hour lays the foundation for its second half. It has to take the time to fully sculpt its scares, which it does beautifully. The intense exorcism in the second hour is the film's big pay off and feels like its pride and joy. It is without question the most terrifying scene in the film.<br /><br />At the same time, many may feel like the film is too slow at first. The little things obviously build to larger and more gratifying sequences later on, but it could be seen as a bit too meticulous for its own good for some. Ed seems a bit too protective for Lorraine at times. The film does a good job of laying out why, but Ed and Lorraine having the discussion every time they have a moment to themselves is a bit much. \\"The Conjuring\\" may also take things a little overboard in its final act, especially when you take into consideration that's it's supposed to be based on a true story. Lastly, Ron Livingston is horrible and seems out of place in the horror genre. Near the end of the film, he's asked to verbally console his wife and his line delivery is way too stiff and rigid to sound like a caring husband.<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\" establishes a thick, rich, and terrifying atmosphere that is sure to leave audiences biting their nails and choking back screams. James Wan has delivered another horror film that is sure to leave one hell of an impact on its viewers.anything, which is one of its strengths. The first hour lays the foundation for its second half.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Plenty of fast moving action, no time to get bored. Do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand any part of the plot.
B000P12LWY|1.0|I would love to watch and HEAR the whole series on DVD.  Unfortunately, the closed caption option doesn't work.  Hey, folks, there are some people (like me) that totally rely on the cc to watch a movie/series.  If you say it is available, please make it so.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Quickly drawn in to the characters and storylines.Main character grows before your eyes. Nice little twist of trouble to solidify the main characters relationship. A very quick and easy story.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|the game is a great time waster you can pick up and go with the puzzles Zeptolab has another hit.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Lots of good songs and variety of musical themes.  Good beach music in some songs. Worth listening to with family and friends.
0307474259|5.0|This book and Taubes' more voluminous Good Calories, Bad Calories were precisely the extensively-researched and intelligent discussion I was looking for on why we get fat. Never in a million years did I think I would agree with restricting carbohydrates; I thought that was for fad-diet folks looking for a quick fix. I stumbled upon this book after reading part of Wheat Belly, which is nowhere near as intelligently written as Taubes' books are, but at least got me looking in the right direction. I tend towards leanness, but I have been plagued with digestive problems for several years now. I eliminated dairy products from my diet and that did help, but not entirely. Thinking it could be related to gluten, I began reading Wheat Belly. Once I had accepted William Davis' argument about why modern wheat is not suitable for a dietary staple, it was easy to see the logic of carbohydrates-as-foe presented in Taubes' books.<br /><br />Taking sugar and flour out of one's diet is quite eye-opening. It is perfectly clear to me that I have been addicted to these things - despite being an overall healthier-eating American than average.  It is also crystal-clear that proteins and fats satiate for a much longer period of time.  I was at work yesterday and was surprised to notice that it was 12:36. I had not thought about eating lunch or been at all hungry, so I didn't even look at the clock to see when I would break for lunch.<br /><br />The one thing I have a small discrepancy with in Taubes' books is that, in saying that exercise is not helpful to lose weight, some may believe that exercise is not beneficial at all. Bodies look better AND leaner when musculature is nicely developed. (Besides exercise having many other side benefits.)  It is possible to be thin, but not well-shaped. Taubes does say that he himself exercises, so perhaps this was just a desire to stick close to the subject of actual fat cells, not how fat one appears to be.<br /><br />I believe every American shouldread this book. Every person should understand this message. It chaps my hide that this is not the message The Powers That Be have been giving to the American people...and we are all getting fatter and sicker, fruitlessly trying to cut calories and exercise more.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|Most of this film were funny, but the level of risque behavior was a bit over the top for me.  The first movie was just my level for the 'in your face' bad choices made by this bunch of goof offs. In this film I felt that I was dropped into a ranch event that would not lighten up. Perfect for the younger movie goers, but I felt that the story suffered a bit. Characters were better developed and stronger than the first movie. I felt as if the nudity was pushed too far.
1568363931|5.0|This cookbook is filled with great ideas for simple, bento-style lunches.  The recipes are supplemented by helpful hints that allow you to prepare food more efficiently.  As an added bonus, Makiko Itoh includes information about each item, allowing you to better understand the food within the context of Japanese culture.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|My husband and I watched this movie together and really enjoyed it.  It has a good story line.  I enjoyed seeing Maggie Smith in another movie as I really enjoyed her character in Downton Abby.  If you are a fan of Maggie, you should like this movie with her.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Really enjoy the show.  Some aspects not as good as season one, but I like the characters (and the actors).
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun.  Very close to Bejeweled, better in some ways.  Good modes.  Fast-paced. More time to play before bar runs out.  Nice jewels.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic comedies.  Now go get it, and watch it, you won't be disappointed!
B002XMGGK6|4.0|The story of a good American gone rogue due to injustice. I thought this was a good movie, Jamie and Gerard are a good combo in this film that leaves you guessing until the very end.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Leonard Cohen is a remarkable musician and the choices on this cd are marvelous.  I already have this one but bought this for a friend.  That's how much I love it.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Just a lot of fun to watch.  Good music and entertaining for most ages.  The blu-ray video quality is excellent!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|As it starts out with all these silly little games you start off just to take a peek, then find yourself hooked. LOL...Now I love it, and yes somehow find the time. This one has gained in popularity so it doesn't take much convincing, so drop what you're doing, and join us in this mad cuteness. Game is well executed, makes you feel like a genius, ok I need to get a life...Lol.
B002QBS9KE|3.0|If you want to keep the foam for more than a few days. consider glueing them to the earpiece. After that their not bad for a while but you should have extras. The headset is the best.<br /><br />Would recommend. Your choices are limited in this case.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|We are always intrigued by life after death stories.  This book is special because the experience is described by a doctor and former doubter.  This is not a subject that can be proven but this book proves there is much to consider and think about.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|I'm not real big on first person view movies but this was pretty awesome. Telekinesis would definitely be my super power of choice after watching this film.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I didn't realize this was a true story when I started watching it. It is a great story about a dedicated, young surfer. The ocean cinematography was outstanding.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I thought his portrayal of addiction was okay.<br />The CG was poorly rendered.<br />The nudity was blatant, cheap, and tasteless.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|I had a Nikon rangefinder that I had won as a doorprize at a golf tourney.  The Nikon is advertised for use in hunting but I was told by a Golfsmith salesperson that it was the same as a Callaway rangefinder.  NOT true.  I always had problems that I could not hold the rangefinder steady enough to get a reading so I always got yardage off the side of a bunker or from the golfers in front of us tending the flag.  No need for that now.  This Bushnell with the pinseeker technology gives you a yardage reading right to the flag.  It locks in on the flag and gives you a yardage reading.  Other reviewers have complained about battery life but I've already used it several rounds and have had no problems.  Works great for me!
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|This book is a very honest account of life stages, and had the potential to be over sharing, but it perfectly balanced life stories with lessons learnt. I'd definitely seek out more books from this author.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's not bad but it is repetitive. Great for younger kids. My boys love it. So does my husband. Thanks
B004LWZW7O|5.0|This is a pretty good movie; I liked it immediately the first time I saw it. It's mildly entertaining with an original concept.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Useless to me. I can't figure it out. Wish I hadn't bought it. Don't waste your money on this one
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Great book. Highly recommended. I picked this up hoping it will get me interested in reading again. I can't wait to read hid next book already.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I learned so much history from this book.  The struggles this genius went through is inspiring.<br />The author Sean Patrick takes you step by step through this man's life.  Highly recommend this book to anyone.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|It's really fun. it keeps me busy for hours. There's many different options. You can make them look any way you want. It's awesome . I love it
B0031R5K68|5.0|Another can't put downer from dan brown. Want o o to Washington DC again now so I can have a look
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|Very nice case for my iPhone. But only one think - I expected 3 stickers for button, but I did not find it in the package???
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|My daughter is a monster high freak and this was a perfect addition to her collection! I would recommended to any parent for their child.
0441018866|4.0|This is a very good book; hard to pick up at first since it is written in the first person perspective of two people that swaps back and forth sometimes from one paragraph to the next.  Once I got used to that, it was easy to get into.  If you like hard sci fi, space opera, and Reynolds, you'll love this book.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Great show - like seeing a musical every week.  Love the tunes and stars and look forward to many more seasons.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|If you like Bram Stokers Dracula you like this. If you didn't then you won't. I don't like books that bounce around from one character to the next. Just when I would get into one persons story, boom, your now hearing another one.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This book is amazing! I love it. I reccomend it to anyone. Very positive! Love love love love love love!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I DIDN'T GET THIS, I DIDN'T ORDER THIS YET.I MAY I LOVED THE MOVIE IT SELF.<br />SOMETHING I MAY THINK ABOUT LATER.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I enjoyed one songe so much, I had to buy the CD. I like upbest music and that song projected that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is too fun! I'm horrible at it because it's very challenging, but it's so fun, you don't mind missing or getting blown up because it's so funny to watch. I did get good enough to get to Vector, but that's about it. My 7 year olds have already gone beyond that, so it may not be as hard for younger players.... LOL! :-) Great fun for everyone! I highly recommend it. :-)
1609611543|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a nutritionist. It was at times a slow read (due to a lot of scientific jargon) but what was shared was life saving and made you read it in its entirety...at times even re-reading some sections. Our lives have changed so much over the decades...and what many don't realize is how much our foods have changed during that same time...I don't know about others, but I grew up in a time in which many of the issues our children deal with today just never existed back then...only leads me to believe that it comes down to nutrition - what we put in our mouths and on our bodies...this book is definitely worth the investment and time if you value your health and life...
B000VWYNOG|5.0|wonderful tunes, one of my favorites, glad I purchased it, what more can i say... great deal and would recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|When I was younger I would love to watch my brother play legend of Zelda on his SNES. I watched because I'm terrible at video games, but I loved helping him solve the puzzles. this game was a hyper version of everything I loved about Zelda. I did wish  it was longer. I knew from other reviews that it was going to be short, but the ending felt a bit abrupt to me.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I've loved this movie since it came out. Very cute. Danny Devito is great but the whole cast is, too.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|We loved him on American Idol and there are two hits on the CD. It was a good purchase of current hits.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think that this is a great summer game. When you have the new movie coming out it great to learn the characters again.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love playing. My only complaint would be that it freezes up all the time, and sometimes when I hit a lower number I get a bad bingo.
B002KYXO7A|5.0|I have seen it many times and never tire of it.  If you enjoy musicals this is a must see.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|the best game ever but i would to see kindle and ipod play together because i like to play with my brother but he has a ipod
B00BOXZAG6|3.0|This is a strange movie. Not sure how i feel about it. Watched it through, nice message and love story. The world its set in is a little farfetched, but fun.<br /><br />The 3D is a must , cant imagine it being entertaining in 2d
B0058H8V6K|4.0|And so begins the chorus of the opening track on Perfectionist, Natalia's debut album.<br />I haven't listened to this album in its entirety yet, but I have listened to a majority of the songs, and I have to say that I have loved what I have heard so far. Her music contains a much darker element than most pop music, but it still maintains the same catchiness of the music of other pop artists. She also experiments with different themes than others, such as the BDSM-focused \\"Mirrors,\\" the biggest and most recognized single from this album.<br />Now, for all the comparisons which have been garnered between her and labelmate Lady Gaga, which Kills herself calls \\"so mean,\\" it is easy to see the great differences in both of their musical styles. Kills has much darker and sinister lyrics than Gaga, and her music is built upon equally dark sounding and memorable choruses (One or two listens through \\"Mirrors\\" will leave you singing the chorus repeatedly).<br />Overall, this album does show that Kills has some growing to do in her songwriting, though her vocals are incredibly and impressively polished, even when she does live performances. The new songs she has released (\\"Saturday Night\\" and \\"Problem\\") in 2013 show that she has indeed grown into her songwriting more and has developed as an artist. So overall, I'm glad to see what Kills comes up with next, and if you prefer the darker tracks on some generally lighter albums, this album will be perfect for you.
B00CS74W0C|1.0|can not compare to 50 shades, horrible book. terrible story. I felt dumber for having read it, stupid ending.<br />Kept thinking it would get better but it got worse
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I bought this for my husband who really loved it. The movie is not afraid to show faith issues and manages to show forgiveness when people of faith slip up.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|My cousin put me on to The Weeknd 2 years ago and I was in love with him immediately!! I downloaded ALL his songs as soon as I got home and I couldn't be any happier! He is truly an amazing new artist! Buying his mixtape album shows my true support to his music. I can't wait for his official album to drop in August/September. I know he will blow our minds once again!!
B00B29J0I6|1.0|The upper levels are unplayable due to constant gamecircle screens. What programer thought it was a good idea to interrupt play with a black screen overlay telling you how many boxes you have broken.  I'll pay you another $.99 if you remove gamecircle.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It is hard to believe such a short workout can kick my booty so hard! The first time I did this I couldn't walk for 3 days-which shows how hard the workouts are AND how out of shape I am. Sigh.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hated the new &quot;upgrade &quot; the minute it installed on my Kindle Fire.  However, I decided to be fair and give it a try.  Well after two weeks I still hate it and will uninstall this app and try some others with good reviews and almost 5 star ratings. I especially dislike the &quot;games&quot; feature, the &quot;gifts &quot; and the earning points garbage. I have games on my Kindle to play games.  I want comprehensive weather from a weather app. I shouldn't be surprised at TWC though. I dumped their website from my laptop 3yrs. ago in favor of Weather Underground, Intellicast and Accuweather.
1451695195|3.0|too technical.  did not really prove to the lay person abput heaven.  other than the orbs and Om, no other description of heaven was given.  Very disapointing!!!
0446547638|5.0|I love this book!! Always movie worthy. Hurry up with the next one please! Nicholas Sparks just has a way of pulling you in and making you fall in love with the characters!!
B000V39KDO|4.0|300 is based on historical events and seeks to portray Spartan culture as well as the actual battle.  I marvel at the strength of the Spartan queen as well as the loyal warriors who march with Leonidas and die with him.  There are also, as in every culture, those who engage in politics and deceit--even in Sparta.<br /><br />This movie has a powerful, oppressive empire (the Persians) and an underdog.  It has those with honor and those with none.  This is a movie for fans of history and of action movies, but is not for general family viewing.  There is one steamy scene with the King and his Queen, as well as plenty of bloody battle action.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|In this day and age that says a great deal about a product.  I hope for a continued inclination to rate this way.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Probably the best season so far looking forward to the last season. Plan on buying  the whole collection hilarious stuff
B005IQZB14|5.0|The author's story about her hike through the Pacific Crest Trail and her own life was pretty amazing and thought provoking.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book. I couldn't stop reading it! I can't wait for the movies to come out. It's a good mix of humor, lust, love, witty & suspenseful! I absolutely love this trilogy! (:
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I keep my Kindle Fire by my bed for the sleepstream and now as my alarm clock. And, I love love love that you can set multiple wake up times. Like for the weekend. Also the sound starts out low and then gets louder. It's not so annoying. Love it.
014241543X|5.0|I was sucked in by this book from beginning to end. The author did a great job delving into how we deal with loss, which seems the principal theme; but also into the various relationships and the awkwardness that Mia feels in her life. I guess I related to that and ultimately that is what had me so emotionally involved in the story up to the main character's final decision.<br />I definitely recommend reading this, but make sure that you have a big box of tissue on hand!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is the most intense book to ever be written. OMG I recommend this book to every single person on earth. This book should be knighted the best book on earth by the Queen of England. This book is truly the most intense book ever.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|If you like Danny Kaye you will love this one.  And if you don't know Danny Kaye I recommend you do! Something fun to watch with the family!
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Loved reading this book again, reminding you of the gleefulness to watch accidents or now with so many reality tv shows, at some point, this could happen... Scary but true.<br />Great read into the depth of depravity
B003G4W49C|5.0|simply written, but at the same time filled with layers of thought. Morality, child abuse, politics, reality all great questions raised by the book.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Very good game play. Better than typical arcade style match three games. Fun and great for all ages. Ancient world setting is interesting and educational without being boring.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Very detailed report. You have more details than any program I know. Other weather programs will work hard to catch up to this excellent product. I am still learning more advanced features unknown to other programs.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is a comedic genius; if you are needing a laugh, this book is great because you can read it over and over again on a bad day!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This season is non stop comedy, you really get to know the characters and become attached to them. How could you not like this show? If you haven't seen this season, watch it, because season 1 is laugh-out-loud funny.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved this app. Then you &quot;fixed&quot; it.<br />Now it's a pain in the neck to try to suss out any useful information from the jumble on the screen. Since it no longer works, it's time to delete.<br />One star, only because zero apparently isn't an option.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|It is an easy read.  Quite fun and enjoyable.  The flaw of too many romantic books and movies....they are not meant to be good guides for setting expectations of real relationships. The female character in this book put herself at great risk of being walked over by a man that was engaged to her best friend, in hopes that he would end up with her. Books and movies have happy endings.  Enjoy a nice story, but don't take it to heart girls.
B0036FYO12|5.0|You just cant beat great acting and suspense, Redford is a prolific actor as well as director, keeps you on the edge
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|It just arrived and my grandson he is 4 years old watched the video and he loved it!! If you have a little in your life this is a great video to watch.

B0086VWCPG|5.0|Compared to map my run, Runtastic wins hands down! Well worth the money.  Buy this app and get to work testing out while you sweat.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I love playing games and this one is a lot of fun.  My grandson and I play this one.  Enjoy!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Was a great twist and kept you wondering how it would turn out. Christian is a Hot mess, but delicious!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift is one of the most acclaimed singers and songwriters out there. With four albums released and several awards under her belt, her latest album, Red, tops it all.<br /><br />  The album is filled with intense, emotion-driven songs that you can relate to even though you haven't experienced the exact situation yourself. It's about the \\"crazy, intense, insane, semi-toxic relationships.\\" Swift showcases her range with a pop-like sound, without leaving her country roots.<br /><br />  Her lead single, \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\", is a catchy pop tune that will get stuck in your head after just listening to it once and makes you want to sing and dance to it, which is what Swift intended. Also with \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\", it is a big step for Swift as it is a very pop, dub step type song. It gets the message through clearly, and it shows how she can do all type of music besides country.<br /><br />  Aside from those songs, the album also has slow, intense ballads that make you feel what she was feeling, such as the song \\"All Too Well\\". This song shows specific moments in one of her relationships, and how everything was too vivid. It was also the first song she wrote for this album, but is also one of the most powerful ones.<br /><br />  This album has definitely showed Swift's range, but also how she has grown. Her lyrics have gotten more mature, and how she has improved as a song writer. Unlike her last album, Speak Now, where she wrote all of her own music, this album has collaborations with Ed Sheeran and Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol.<br /><br />  Overall, Swift has put together an amazing album that I could go on and on about. Each song tells its own unique story, from how she got there to the very end. I can't review each song, even though I want to, but this album shows how she's grown from her very first one to now. And I can say that everything about this album is spectacular, from the catchy lyrics to the hair flipping ballads. And Ican't wait to see what she has in store next.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|Brand new, unopened.<br />I am seeing this band live in September, when they will play all of this album, so I needed to listen to it first.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The free version of the game is awesome  but it is not complete. You have to buy the full game so you can play it and now guess what I don't have a amazon card.
1469984202|4.0|This 500 page omnibus is an incredibly action packed quick read with an original story and excellent characters. A definite must read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love this game. My little pony rocks. I may be addicted. You can sit and play this all day long. I love getting all the different ponies.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|A Fun way to pass the time when you are bored! Love the different levels and types of pudding monsters!
B002XBVQKW|5.0|Wow, if you are looking for an all time great story, music and stars, this is it! I recently saw this movie with my grandkids (6 & 9 yo's) and they loved it too!  The only negative would be that those songs are still playing in my head, weeks afterwards!
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I must say Joe keeps it grown and sexy with this record. Also I recommend copping the 14 track exclusive at target because the album is one of his best work in a couple of years.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friend mark has 7.2 and he had it for about a month now and I'm stuck using 7.1 and 7.2 adds gamertags and other stuff in to the game

Anybody who has ever wondered why the world doesn't always go our way should watch this movie - how about we just don't use enough of our brain to turn the world around?  We need a magic pill.  Nothing wrong to dream about it, right?  Why not 5 star?  I think I want to find out what would happen the next to our hero/future president, etc.

B007M45PMU|5.0|I can't help but think \\"these guys could give Lennon and McCartney a good run for their money.\\" We'll see if their next album is as good as their first.  Their music is extremely original. Every one of the songs on this disc is very very good, and very original. They didn't throw in a bunch of deadbeat filler songs in between a couple of hits, like a lot of bands do! I'm just hoping they don't end up in a pissing match with each other and go the way of other good bands.

0743564413|2.0|What is The Sun Also Rises about?  Hmm, that's hard to say.  This story doesn't really seem to be about anything.  The true meaning must be taken more from symbols and allusion rather than the direct actions of the characters.<br /><br />The story follows a group of bored socialites as they travel from Paris to Pamplona, Spain in post World War I Europe, no doubt in search of some kind of meaning for their morally bankrupt lives.  The group spends several days in Pamplona watching the running of the bulls and the bull fights, before splitting up and going back to their respective homes.<br /><br />Ernest Hemingway is considered by many to be one of America's most brilliant writers, winning both the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.  A brilliant writer, but ultimately unhappy it seems.  He was married four times and eventually took his own life in 1961.  The Sun Also Rises was Hemingway's first novel, written in 1924 and published in 1926.<br /><br />William Hurt became one of my favorite audio book narrators after hearing only one of his books, Stephen King's Hearts in Atlantis.  He has a really unusual style that, at first, sounds odd and bewildering.  After listening to him for a while, however, he really grew on me.  Frankly, I don't think I would have picked up this audiobook if he hadn't been the narrator.  I enjoyed his reading again, although I can't honestly pinpoint what it is I like about him.<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises was a tough one for me.  On the surface, it seems to be a story about wealthy people who lead empty and meaningless lives.  In part, I think that's what Ernest Hemingway intended, but why are their lives so empty?  I did a bit of reading up on this novel, looking at what other people had to say about it.  They throw around words like \\"expatriate\\" and \\"disillusioned\\" and \\"lost generation.\\"  Why this so-called \\"lost generation\\" became so \\"disillusioned\\" that they \\"expatriated\\" themselves is beyond me.  Were they disillusioned with humanity because of the war, or was it just America's involvement in the war?  I guess I'll have to leave that up to the scholars.  Even though I didn't really get this audiobook, I learned a lot about the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and also about a little slice of American history as well.ey disillusioned with humanity because of the war, or was it just America's involvement in the war?

1781162646|4.0|Joyland is a Stephen King novel, but it is not a typical Stephen King novel. First and foremost it's short - just under 300 pages. Second, although there is a ghost and a young boy who could be psychic, that's not the heart of the book. The heart of the book is Devin Jones, a college student who has recently had his heart broken. Taking a summer job at a second rate amusement park called Joyland Devin becomes obsessed with the story of the ghost of a young woman who was murdered in the park several years earlier. Along the way he learns all about carny life, makes life-long friends and meets a unique little boy who `knows' things and helps Devin in his search for the \\"Carny Killer\\".<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. The main character was really likeable and King portrayed his broken hearted angst perfectly. And the book ending packs an emotional wallop. It was a perfect summer read and if you are a King fan you will enjoy this departure from his usual horror fare. Even if you aren't a fan of King I recommend the book, it's not scary at all.

B00BUAEYVK|2.0|A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD (2013) is a total mess that was a waste of time and money for me as a renter and for the producers as a legacy.<br /><br />Soundtrack music under action scenes is lousy. A lengthy vehicle chase sequence through the congested streets of Moscow is clearly a CGI cartoon. It and the various shootout scenes are BORING. Worst is the plot: John McLane (Bruce Willis), who throughout the movie says he's in Russia on vacation, falls into a lot of trouble when he helps out his son, a CIA spook. \\"Jack\\" John McLane Jr. (Jai Courtney) persistently calls his dad by his Christian name. You KNOW that'll change by the fadeout.<br /><br />The plot is confusing, subtitle translations of Russian are too small and disappear too fast.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|- I am Catholic and am familiar with the tenets of my faith. Sometimes I forget that the biblical stories were of real men who faced the same challenges I face today.<br />In Zeolot by Reza Aslan you read about the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth.  It reads more like a biography of a noted individual rather than a biblical text.<br />Most of the stories I was familiar with and others I had forgotten the details.<br />This book gives you another dimension of the life and times of a man that has influence millions through the Christian faith.

B006XOBFJC|5.0|After reading some of the reviews on this site and others, I went ahead and decided to purchase this.  The price was incredibly low  so I figured it would not be a big loss if the reviews turned out to be wrong.  Well, they were right!  As everyone will tell you there is not one perfect recording of the entire Ring out there. That being said, this one is a darn good one and for the money, you cant go wrong. The sound quality is unbelievable !! The orchestral passages are out of this world!!  Yes, there might be better Brunhildes out there and better Wotans, but trust me, all in all this recording will not disappoint. This is a bare bones package where all you get are the 14 CDs in their sleeves listing the cuts on each CD.  Since I have access to a libretto and synopsis, this worked for me.  But they have a &#34;deluxe&#34; edition of this recording that includes better packaging and a libretto of each opera. it costs a few dollars more, but still a bargain!!

B009LMTDL0|5.0|Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg is the current \\"it\\" business book and centers around women's empowerment in the work place.<br />Sandberg who comes with experience from government, Google, and Facebook has a fascinating path to her positions.<br />This book is a bit anecdotal in parts and maybe because I am a man I can't sympathize with her issues of women in the workplace.  Her story is impressive and she does serve as an example for women that they can succeed in the tough rumble and tumble world of business.<br />Nothing new in this book, but message to women that they need to take a more active approach in deterring the path of their career is a good one.
1439190275|3.0|My very valuable opinion is stick with the old book called &#34;The New Diet Revolution&#34;. Don't buy in to all the new things they've added.

Go with the original book and your blood work will be perfect within 3 weeks if you stick to it.

Working out of his car,<br />the main character does all his research, describing the difficulties of late nights, unexpected events and<br />inconveniences of tracking down evidence. Answers come to the Lincoln lawyer through his persistent direct<br />questioning of those involved and his courage to directly confront, while being wise when and how he gathers information.  I like the way those positive character traits are revealed just in the daily interaction of the lawyer<br />with others and how ultimately, the lawyer gets his man.

B00AH69AX0|5.0|This CD is damn good. It is so good that every time I hear of a new metal band this is the bar (so to speak) that I usually use to compare it to. I know it's not really fair to new metal bands but the sound on this disc is so perfect. If I had to give up all my albums and keep just one, this would be it. It's kind of unbelievable how much replay value this recording has. The guitar riffs & solos, bass, drums & vocals are just insane, yet still methodically thought out to give it a very heavy yet groovy feel. I don't think any band in the past or future could create a better metal album than this. It's just that good. I guess it's possible but it would take a lot of skill, brain power & determination to top this.<br /><br />It's too bad Metallica can't get this kind of chemistry back when they make albums now. Ah, well can't win em' all I guess. At least we have this CD to enjoy at our leisure if we own the disc anyway. :)

B008JFUO0Y|2.0|Much of what made the original 'Evil Dead' seem so good was that it was one of the first horror films set in a cabin in the woods. But it had a lot more going for it. It was daring in it's depiction of gore and violence for the time of it's release. It was also atmospheric, and actually often pretty scary. There were weaknesses involved due to it's incredibly low budget, but the film worked. It's a classic. For me personally it did have one weakness, and that was the cheesy robotic demon voices. I saw the Evil Dead when it first hit theaters back in the early 80's and loved it but thought the silly robot-like demon voices were stupid. Other than that the film was a truly great horror film. I also did a smirk and said 'Pfft\\" when it happened in this version as well, as I shook my head left to right and laughed at the silly and hokey feel of it. It's what I didn't like about 'Drag me to Hell' as well- When that robot demon opens it's mouth so many years later, once again.<br /><br />Evil Dead II on the other hand while sometimes being the equal of the first film, ended up delving into slapstick humor, and that ruined it for me. So I did not like the idea of turning what started off as moody solid and often terrifying horror into a some kind of silly comedy. That made no sense to me. It's the same reason I disliked Army of Darkness even more. To me it was like taking the demonic Exorcist theme and mixing it with Jason and the Argonauts and adding in slapstick humor.  I did not get it. So just saying ahead of time, I am not one of the followers of the series. I did not like any of the series but the first film. But yes, I did love the first Evil Dead movie....<br /><br />But what about this remake?<br /><br />Well I had a lot of issues with it in all honesty. Firstly, at least the version I rented online does not contain a couple of scenes I noticed in the trailers. One being the girl chained in the cellar sticking her face out of the opening of the door and singing a creepy little number. I was waiting for that but it never came. Second issue is that of the trailer. It's better than the movie is. If you see the trailer it leaves you expecting far more than the movie delivers. Another issue I had was the typical very familiar formula of young college aged kids stuck out in the woods. Nothing wrong with that, except here the treatment offers too many familiar elements and nothing what so ever that is refreshing or original. It feels like too many other horror films with a similar tagline and locations.<br /><br />Yet another issue is that when this remake follows the original Evil Dead it fails to outdo or even match the effectiveness of the same material done much better and with more style and substance in the original. It just does the job, but without really grabbing you at all. Yet another thing that bothered me is that there is every reason in the world to expect great things to happen. Location is typical but good, the sets look creepy enough, but none the less the atmosphere and tension seems rather lite to the touch. It's just not very thick convincing or all that great.<br /><br />The gore comes in about half way through and there is a certain satisfying feeling about it, and it's done very well. In fact it doesn't particularly feel non-unique. It actually works pretty well. And then later on when the gore get's deep and truly over the top it seems done intentionally, seemingly to squeeze a rather otherwise uneventful film for everything they could at the last minute. When the movie get's extremely gory it really get's very gory. And even die-hard gore fans should be satisfied with that aspect of the movie. But in the end I found my self  flicking my wrist at the TV and blowing out a rather snoring annoyed exhale as I said under my breath \\"Oh please.... another crappy movie that promised much more that it delivered\\", while shaking my head left to right with a little lip music that soon followed.<br /><br />For what it isthe movie turns out to be generally entertaining in a very non- rewarding typical way. The film also feels pretty typical of the usual horror movies of late. Could have been much better, and the over the top reviews and over zealous add campaigns didn't help. The film is not the match of the original, and it's not even half as good. But if you love gore for the sake of gore the last half of the film should do the job. Otherwise I'd skip on this one. It's not all that scary, and pretty much the kind of thing we've all seen too many times to even care to count any longer.the movie turns out to be generally entertaining in a very non- rewarding typical way.

0446554995|2.0|Two Graves completes the trilogy of books focusing on Helen, Special Agent Pendergast's wife. For twelve years he thought she had been killed in an African hunting accident, then his investigations into her death led him to believe that her death had not been accidental, then they led him to the realization that her death had been staged. And finally, as Cold Vengeance came to an end and he was reunited with her, she was quickly ripped away from him once again.<br /><br />With no question about her fate this time, Pendergast spirals into a state of extreme depression, to the point that his long-time associate with the New York Police department, Vincent D'Agosta is concerned that Pendergast may take his own life. In a last-ditch effort to bring Pendergast out of his depression, D'Agosta asks for his help in solving a string of brazen murders that have begun taking place in New York City hotels. Not only does the the case file intrigue him, but Pendergast discovers that the killer is taunting him specifically. Someone wants Pendergast to chase him and Pendergast is quick to oblige.<br /><br />Pendergast's investigation into the murders takes him to Brazil, where he uncovers a fortress housing a group of doctors, who for decades have been conducting medical experiments on human subjects. At that point in the story my level of enjoyment for the book changed. It became a disappointment. I'll avoid any significant spoilers, but will reveal that these doctors are Nazis who fled to South America after the war, where they resumed their plans to perfect the human race. Not very original, and as I said, disappointing coming from two authors whom I've enjoyed reading for so long. I'm hopeful that eventually the Pendergast books will return to the glory days of Relic and Cabinet of Curiosities instead of what they've become recently--a slow-moving investigation into uninteresting aspects of Pendergast's life.

With everything from vampires to demons, 'City of Bones' never fails to entertain in a manner that will keep you glued.<br /><br />Cassandra Clare is now one of my favourite authors and her books along with [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter]], [[ASIN:B0054GQHIY Blood Skies]], [[ASIN:B00D3XWOUK Vampire Elite]], [[ASIN:B004W0COEY The Fallen Star]], [[ASIN:B00AR849RU Whispering Stone]], and [[ASIN:B008LUYSAE The Chronicles of Narnia]].

0140544518|5.0|this is for anyone who enjoys a spin on a classic story. this book can be passed down from one generation to another..buy it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER INVENTED!!!!!!! I'M A HUGE STAR WARS FAN, AND LIKE ANGRY BIRDS!!!<br />IF YOU LIKE ANGRY BIRDS OR STAR WARS, YOU NEED TO GET THIS APP!!! (ROVIO NEEDS TO MAKE<br />ANGRY BIRDS LORD OF THE RINGS!! :-D)
B008FWHUQM|1.0|Absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen recently. I hung in there watching it, hoping that it would become  more interesting but wasted my time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app was free so I thought I would try it. I really enjoyed it and found it fun, challenging, but not hard. On each floor you lift things, open drawers, boxes, or inside things to find clues or tools you need to unlock the door to get to the next floor. There are only 10 levels in this game. That is the downside. If there was a paid version of this game, I would buy it. Once you figure out the clues to unlock door 1, you understand what you need to do on each level. I never needed to ask for hints or help and I am a sleep deprived mom of a 3 year old. Try it if you like to figure things out and solve puzzles. Some items you find, are not of use, just to keep you guessing.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|it was the same depressing story line  throughout the book with little else going on.<br />I would have liked something more uplifting for the end.......
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|What a stinker of a movie this was--I really wanted to like it--I waited in complete suspense for its' release. I can't believe it was nominated for even one Oscar.<br /><br />The acting was abominable; rote, wooden, uninspired, and cliched. Forty-five minutes into the movie, I kept wondering, \\"who cares about these characters, or even if they're historically accurate and portray 'real people' ?\\" The acting was just too mechanical and cliched to care.<br /><br />A shame. I really did want to enjoy this film. It's proof that a poor director with equally talentless actors/actresses can drag even the best subject matter down.<br /><br />Sure, we knew what was going to happen... I'd kept up with the 'hunt' for Al-Qaeda operatives, I knew beforehand all the AQ personalities that were mentioned. I followed the after-action news pretty intensely--just as I did with two-year investigation of Nixon and Watergate. Three masterful actors (Robards, Redford, and Hoffman) proved that one could take on an actual historical event of which the origins and outcome were known to the world (and where details were probably published even more thoroughly), and still, truly professional actors could craft great tension, suspense, and audience concern/interest for the characters they portrayed and the storyline even if it was already well-known.<br /><br />Not so with Bigelow and Chastain, et. al.  I was bored enough to check the time about 6x during the movie. I should have just given up and used the time more wisely. \\"Hurt Locker\\" wasn't worthy Oscar material in my mind, either, but at least there, the actors were inspired and skillful. It'll take one hell of a boring night for us to watch another Bigelow movie.<br /><br />Thankfully, we watched this as a rental. Back in the mail and good riddance!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Absolutely love solving each room, each level is challenging yet not too difficult. Really hope New levels are released soon.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It keeps on crashing on my kindle but on any thing else it works just fine so I gave 1 star rating for kindle
B00594XOZU|1.0|I think this app should work for every touch screen device. STUPID. Not everyone can afford devices that work with just 1 app. IT SHOULD WORK FOR EVERY DEVICE
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Not consistently told.  Skips around too much.  Should be a consistent series of events. Too wordy.  Needs more descriptive events in the realm of &#34;Heaven&#34;.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|If you are looking for a drama series that will keep you on the edge of your seat guessing what's gonna happen, this set is for you. Well casted. Great plot. Relatable to current events and makes you consider your position on terrorists  I loved it!!!! Bought this for a Christmas gift!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game it has a lot of cool stuff like boards and characters and all kinds of stuff! You really should get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I play this with my friends all of them on ipads or iphones and me on my kindle it annoys me when I cant play simply because Amazon or kindle hasn't been updated. Please get better on updates and I'd give a five star
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey does an excellent job of making you feel like your right there in the book with the characters, just dieing to turn the page and find out whats in store for them next!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game for a brain. challenge. love this game. thanks. the app lets you interact with the room your in and does require some thinking skills also helps an eye for detail.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Let me start off my stating that I am not one to generally read books for making lifestyle changes.  Most of them lose me pretty quick because simply stated, they are not believable.  Bigger Leaner Stronger does not fall into that category.  I could not put the book down and before I knew it I was done.  Let me set a little context here.  I have been exercising for many years and have gotten pretty good results but I have always fallen short of my goals. Bodybuilding is a lot like a golf swing.  If one aspect is off, the entire system breaks down. Mike does an excellent job of explaining, in a way that anyone can easily comprehend, all of the aspects that you must incorporate to be successful. His writing is supported by studies as well as his own trial and error. This book takes most of the guess work out of setting up a sound exercise program, regardless if  you goal is to lose weight, gain muscle and strength or just maintain what you already have. I say 'most of the guess work' because everyone's body is different and adjustments may be necessary. This is a book that you will consisently refer to as you embark on your exercise journey.<br /><br />Last thing I want to say is that you will only get out of this what you put into it.  I know that is very cliche but it's true.  If building a great body was easy, everyone would be walking around with no shirts. This book is the tool you need to put you on the right track.<br /><br />It goes without saying that I highly recommend this book.  Pick it up, you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />NOTE: I have no connection to the author.  I am just a satisified customer.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Father. Of course, the family had to watch it with him on Christmas night. It was an excellent movie. I enjoyed it so much it is now part of my collection too.
B008MM9630|5.0|This is the most adorable game! My daughter loves playing it too. I've had this game numerous times on different phones and I always come back.
0375869026|5.0|I will not make this review long, since there are so many great reviews already out there about this book.<br />Bottom line - love love love this book.  I plan on reading this to my young girls (5 and 4) to teach them empathy and kindness.  Super quick read since you will not be able to put this book down.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Okay, it was cute.  And there is genius merchandising.  But if you have seen one AB you have seen them all... BORING!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was the first time I had ever downloaded a book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this way. The story was great and I felt myself reading with an Irish accent! It is definitely worth reading.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Usually I do like like mysteries but this is very interesting and keeps you guessing right until the end.  Really did enjoy this read.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Bad piggies is fun but angry birds is better. You build little contraptions that the pigs use to get the angry birds eggs. The really huge level is impossible to beat.
B009SGPF0W|4.0|First, if you have never been to a Cirque Do Soleil show, it is a must.  I have been to several including this one and it is worth the money for the live performance.  The music to this and then Love (Beattles) is worth keeping in the collection.  Not an every day thing but hits the spot at times.  Some of it is good for a work out mix.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game.  A little challenging. Something to do if you want to sit and relax. Graphics are not bad for a free game.
0783239955|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies of all time!  We lent out our copy and never got it back, so we were happy to find this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I recommend this game for as anyone who likes a challenge it's super fun for all ages. You can play it with or without the extra game content.
B000T060TG|5.0|This is an iconic piece of work.  It tells stories with meaning.  It breaks your heart.  It lifts you up and makes you want to dance!  Buy it.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This is an absolutely charming book.<br /><br />I won't bother going into the plot since it's been summarized very nicely in other reviews, but I will say it's a classic DWJ story. Very light, very suitable for kids, and exactly the kind of thing a grownup like me feels like turning to when all the angst and dramatic twists that are written into most stories feel like too much...too much. Kind of the literary equivalent of watching Golden Girls reruns - it's lightly amusing and doesn't evoke any deep feelings, but it's still entertaining and helps you forget just how angsty and dramatic real life can be. It reminded me very much of a fairy tale; it's the kind of thing that you just know is incapable of ending in any way except happily. Where you're more sorry for the bad guys than scared of them.<br /><br />I should point out that even though it's light (I'm already getting sick of using that word, but it's probably the best one to describe what I mean), there's definitely comedy in the book. I only recall one bit actually making me laugh out loud - who knew seven league boots could be such a challenge? - but I was nevertheless smiling at most of the rest of it.<br /><br />I can't imagine a kid not liking this book, and if you're an adult looking less for something meaty to sink your teeth into and more for a happy little diversion, you'll enjoy it too. And now I'm going to quit babbling and go hunt down some of my old forgotten DWJ books!
0061124958|5.0|Hardback, brand new. My son loves it! We use it as a bed time story every night. Thank You. Peace.
B008476HBM|2.0|I tried my best to read this so-called masterpiece without falling asleep yet it proved almost impossible. I admit it might be enjoyed by many people yet it just isn't my cup if tea...
B004DLPXAO|2.0|If you are under 60 and you have any interest in multi-tasking this is not robust enough compared to most of the incredible tablets out there.  I would recommend Galaxy's tablets for Android, Acer for Windows 8 or the IPAD.  All are great machines that get it done brilliantly.  Kindle is like wanting a Ferrari and buying a Fiero with a conversion kit.  It does not translate.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Wonderful acting, but the violence at the end was very anti-climactic. Yes, like everyone else, I wanted the bad guy or couple of bad guys to &#34;get their due&#34;, but (spoiler alert) the last part of the movie was sheer genocide.  Is that really how any of us wants the world to get better, by our hero killing off everybody on the other side, indiscriminately?  No chance for redemption?  Tarantino seems to have no belief in the fundamental goodness of humanity.  The first two thirds of the movie were powerful, if weighty.  But I honestly wished I hadn't watched the last third, because all the power of the movie bled out with the blood of those whom our would-be hero massacred.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|One of the most imaginative reads ever created.  I can see this becoming a classic novel series read by future generations - a literary loop to be repeated continually.  Riggs has done the near impossible task of creating a new and different world of fantasy.  Move over Harry Potter.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|This is a book you think you watching a movie. a fund read for the summer! I was a &#34;sigma&#34; experience with a new twist!.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Like all the temple run products, it is fun and engaging.  I am clearly not a very competent user as I can't seem to score well.  I think it is call old man syndrome.  My 8 year old glides through it like it is ingrained in his DNA.  Nice job!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Matthew Quick has portrayed mental illness honestly,in a dignified manner, without over exaggeration. I identified with Pat and Tiffany all too well.
0399162097|5.0|This is one of favorite books that I have read this year! It is a fascinating, entertaining and heartfelt novel that is, at its root, about one family - revealing them broken, whole and healing. Rosemary Cooke narrates her family's extraordinary story and her own extraordinary life. A once verbose child, she has grown up to barely speak, barely offer anything of herself. But in this narration, glimmers of that young and loquacious child shine through. It is an engaging read and one that is hard to set aside as Rosemary's trains of thoughts become more and more interesting and real.<br /><br />The book touches on a lot of big questions and presents the argument against animal experimentation in a way that never once feels preachy, dull or overly sentimental. And yet, there are some truly horrific, heart-wrenching moments and scenes here. It's easy to be drawn into Rosemary's story, and easy to identify with her. And the book ends perfectly. Fowler strikes just the right chord with it - though it isn't easy to say goodbye to these characters. Fowler perfectly balances humanity, love and animal activism. It's just a beautiful, wonderful story - and one of the few that I would recommend to everyone without reservation. It is as close to flawless as they come! The story unfolds in just the way and quickly becomes impossible to set aside. I am curious about Fowler's other books now, too! I can't wait to read more of her work!
0920236162|5.0|I purchased the original edition of this book for a young girl I knew way back when it first came out.  We both loved the small size and the story. Personally, I am delighted that it is possible to still get this version. It makes the book feel like a secret to be discovered.  For those of you who don't read the product description before you purchase something; start now.  This should be an example of how important it is.  Please don't blame Amazon or the book itself because of your oversight.<br /><br />The primary thing to keep in mind is that this is a very funny, very readable story of a strong girl.  The content is the same no matter what size it is.
B001O03NCW|5.0|Just like the goofy movie, it is fun sing along music.  You will listen over and over again.  Worth the buy.
0890090572|5.0|Book looks great.  I am planning to give the book for a Christmas.  Can't wait to see it the to see my nephew's reaction.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|If you are shopping for an &#34;all-purpose&#34; knife, this is it! Very well made and will do just about everything you need done. It feels good, well enough balanced and just right. You won't be unhappy with this knife.
1609611543|5.0|I read this from cover to cover and had to give up Wheat to get rid of belly but if you even eat a tiny bite, to me, does not work~give it all up and eat salads and veggies ~ you will lose weight but in the Belly is still the question ~ hum!
B001LJZ3AG|5.0|Growing up I never thought of myself as a rocker.  I am not a rocker... but how can you not love Pink Floyd?  Great music, worth listening to over and over (and over) again!
B0001RVTXO|5.0|I misplaced my other copy so I had to order a new one. Great condition and protected well. Thank you!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|It's a book that can strengthen your marital relationship. It's easy to read and includes tips to try at the end of every chapter.
B0094FTKIA|2.0|Stupid movie and so surprised that he would make a movie like this ~ I know many loved it but I hated it and the entire story ~ and he was not sexy in the FACE ~
B0091XRRQC|4.0|I love sitting around/laying around as a family, big bowl of popcorn and watching movies together.  This is one of those that your young kids will want to watch several times.  Lots of fun with humor for all.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|No issues with shipping and quick delivery. I was able to enjoy my CD with no worries. I need this on vinyl next if it's available. :)
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|this book kept my interest, from the first page to the last, wonderful read.  I am also reading Safe Haven, which is very good, but have not finished it yet.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Wonderful, Great, could not putt it down or turn it off ~ Wanted more and next season on PBS, we will get more.
0812984412|5.0|just plan incredible. a story of love and reincarnation over a span of 500 years. a must read book and must see movie.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This cd made my ears go \\"Ow, ow, ow\\".  And it made my heart go, \\"Oh. Oh. Oh. Ow!\\"<br /><br />But Amy Grant's new cd made my spirit go, \\"Yay!\\"
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|I feel that this story is as meaningful today as when Frank Miller wrote it 27 years ago.  It was a turning point in comics, this was the age of the mature comic.  This is one of those books I've read countless times and although the movie is good, it doesn't do justice to the book.  I love this story because it is the story of freedom, humanity, and courage.  When the world is at its darkest hour the people themselves rise up and take control.  Batman may lead the charge but it is the people of Gotham that no longer wait for super-men to save them, they save themselves.  I guess without spoiling anything I will leave it there, but I will say, as many times as I have read the book there is always a part at the end that chokes me up.  Great story, 'nuf said.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|More of the PBS series movies and this one will be good.  I have not watched it yet but of course, will!  I love PBS and the Downton Abby Series and I believe this one will be like it.  Love the English series
B007SGM084|5.0|I finished all 3 books in a week! Could not put them down! Definitely one of the best novels I've read!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Based on other reviews I figured I would love this book. I didn't. It was tough to stay interested at times due to the unlikeable characters and I always figured out what would be coming next before the punch line. I finished it, which means it wasn't horrible (because I would have just put it down) but I can't say if asked for book recommendations that I would mention this book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a great game. It is very easy to get into and the pace of play is really good. I haven't finished the game yet, so I guess my one complaint so far is that it's too easy, but I'm expecting that to change as I advance
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King but hadn't read any of his books for a few years. This book will make you think. It's not scary but good. Not the kind of gripping story you can't put down but a very good book just the same.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Incredible books... I wasn't able to put them down and finished them in no time at all! If you haven't read them yet then you must!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my kids both love this game, it's similar to temple run. Kinda hard though. Fun for all!!!!! Worth a download
193700788X|1.0|I can't believe how boring this book was. It was so predictable. I knew right off the bat who the \\"bad guys\\" were and where the book was going. What a terrible way to end such a great series!! Wah wah
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Who doesn't love Peter Pan? It's a classic Disney story done well on DVD. Glad to have it in our collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Incredible books... I wasn't able to put them down and finished them in no time at all! If you haven't read them yet then you must!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love the harry potter series and I was in the market to buy this box set since all the movie were complete. I checked other websites, and not only was it unavailable at some stores, but it was more expensive. + with free shipping, this seller could not be beat. it came in the mail in time, and I really have no regrets or complaints.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. It is very fun and I will always love it maybe better than the last one. I love this game!!
B003AYBCB4|5.0|This is my boyfriend's favorite album and he couldn't wait to get it on vinyl. I initially bought it for him for Father's Day but I couldn't wait to give it to him so he got it early.<br /><br />If you like Tom Waits, this is an essential album.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Incredible books... I wasn't able to put them down and finished them in no time at all! If you haven't read them yet then you must!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Can't get my son of it is the new mickey mouse look forward to buying him some toy too of angry birds lol
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I love the actors in this version and the way this was written. I only wished it was longer and had more from the book. After watching it, I wanted more.
B005544TRQ|5.0|After my friends raving about it, I finally gave in. and WOW its freaking awesome. Do recommenced to anyone looking for a new show to pick up. Or if interested in the lawyer world
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I like how I can crop and edit my photos and make my own memes and save the new pic right to my kindle fire. I love this app
1934451320|5.0|chose it because i want to learn more of its doctrine or philosophy as i firmly believe in the law of attraction
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen this version, the 2011, the 1983 and the 1943 versions. This version is my all time favorite. I like how it has a lot of the what is in the book.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I wish this app had stayed the same it is confusing, visually irritating, and I am disappointed that I need to find a new app as the previous version of this app was wonderful. :(
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Bought his CD as a gift for my mother for her birthday. Saw him on PBS last year and she fell in love with his amazing, versatile, and talented gift. This man play sooo much of everything. Well worth the price! I bought the CD back in July... and she's still playing it. She keeps asking me if I really think she likes it? I just might have to make her a copy back up of it in case she wears the original out!<br /><br />Highly recommend for the guitar enthusiast who's never heard of him or his music before. He varies all over the board with styles and rhythms.<br /><br />Just had to buy her this DVD of him.  We've been listening to his CD for a year now and to see him play all of what we've been listening too is just amazing.  It's been a thrill to watch him live.  His entire body is musical and gets into each and every song.  It's unbelievable what he can do with a guitar!<br />Highly Recommended!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Perfect puzzle game! Has different levels of difficulty plus extra features to challenge all puzzle enthusiast! Fun little game worth the download!
B004S5D3B6|5.0|I love this movie. No way would Christopher Bale have won his oscar had Mark Wahlberg not fed him generous lines. Amy Adams surprises me with each performance. This movie based on fact has everything you could want, messed up guy turns his life around and the underdog gets the girl. I've seen it 3 times now.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Even though I had to sharpen my ears, the dialogue was intelligent and fitted the characters and their status in that society. Costumes were beautiful and again illustrated how they used to dress. The rooms presented are authentic and interesting to see. A pity I could not see episode 3 and the whole of the series.
B000050FEN|5.0|It's raining, the movie's atmosphere is dark, and the mystery keeps unraveling slowly, one sin at a time. Great plot and amazing ending. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were good combination, and I feel both performed really well. One of those movies that I can watch again.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Very disappointing. Easy predictable story within story. The author lost me in the middle of the book. Very hard to finish.<br />L
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|If your a preteen it's not all that bad, the make up was pretty good and so was the CGI. There are times when you just want to be entertained without having to really think about the plot.. which was good because the plot was lame.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|For anyone who loves the group ABBA then you must own this album fron Agnetha.  Her voice sounds better than 30 years ago.
B00BJW6YW6|5.0|You will like this. It's very ambient, romantic, and well put-together. It's nice for setting the mood or just to let it play in the background.Don't over-analyze it, it's just good. 'Nuff said.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like the Spider game.  It is a good one to relax, and play.  My favorite it timing how long it takes, and trying to beat my best time.<br /><br />Fun!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I loved the color and the costumes but the rest was lacking. Totally miscasted. The script was good it's just the acting was so wooden.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's like lord of the rings for adults. Great characters, epic storytelling, full of humour, heroism, romance and magic. Something for everyone. Love it, love it, love it!
B001A4LYN2|4.0|This isn't one of those movies that is really long, but you don't want to see it end. This is one of those movies that goes on and on and then ends unexpectedly.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood is very well done. There's not much I can complain about, save the length, the confusion surrounding the Paul character (though that's possibly what the whole movie's about), and the, at times, exhausting (musical) score. There is definitely a religious theme, that you may have to watch the movie at least twice to totally understand, but the storyline is very realistic.<br /><br />If you like movies that make you think, this one is good for you. I highly recommend.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|The movie came in great condition and of course it is now a classic that has a phrase.  (Five fingers of god!)  I love the movie and so will everyone else
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|First time around I would have given it two maybe three stars but then my 11 year old grandson talked me into renting it again and seen through his eyes it was pretty good. It kept a room full of kids mesmerized and even the girls liked the romance part of the story. So all in all I guess if you have a room full of preteen boys to entertain rent this movie.
B008Y73940|5.0|Loved it! Wish they would make another one !it left me wanting more of him and his driver.  Matthew  McConaughey was great!  Great story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game, I play this a lot more than Angry Birds now and I'm 55.  I DARE ANYONE NOT TO LIKE HIS GAME.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Not many films capture the courage and cowardice, faith and faithlessness, intelligence and stupidity, sensitivity and brutality, and ultimate futility of warfare the way this film does.  It created in me alternative desires:  wish I had been there and glad I wasn't.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I would love to see this again. Just to pick up on things, missed the first time. One Day! I would recommend this movie for people who loved Memento and movies of this type. Great Movie!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I had a wonderful time watching this trilogy. Can't wait for my Superman movie to be mailed to me..I love watching movies in Blu-Ray.
0439023513|5.0|If you liked the other two books, you will enjoy this one.<br />Keeps you on your toes and I loved the ending.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Has everything I need to sharpen my knife on the go. Ergonomically it fits in the hand great, size makes it easy to  keep accessible.<br />Works very well.
B005LAIIKI|1.0|Bad premise to begin with but the directing is just really bad.....some good acting but it stands out.  Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the music.....it is just all wrong and way too loud and does not fit.<br /><br />Save your money and your time!
B002LFAHBO|4.0|If you're a hopeless romantic, you'll enjoy this movie.  There are multiple stories, but does keep you interested throughout. Like!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun! I recommend this game to anyone who needs a time killer. Awesome game!!
B00CL8D83U|5.0|This is a long running British duo who have had their share of hit and miss releases over their career. This is a suprisingly complex, yet very great sounding dance music album! Full of great songs and at only 9 total songs, it is just the right amount to digest. My current favorite track is Love Is A Bourgeois Construct. I'm not sure I know what it's about, but a great song anyway.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone who likes a great story. I love historical fiction. Chrisina Kline wrote a very engaging story which brings this time period to life. I gave the book to my 13 year old daughter to read. There is nothing inappropriate for a teenage reader.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book, I had to instantly download and start reading the second to find out what was to come next!  Pretty interesting read!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Started watching season 1 on Amazon Prime...got my husband addicted as well...couldn't wait for season 2 so we bought it and had a Suits marathon!
B002WJI66C|1.0|The face looks a lot bigger and  the mouth looks wider in this photo. The item i got instead was a very small, stout and did not look like the boo at all in the photo. I would swear it was a boot leg or some junk that wasn't official if the tag didn't check out right. i am very disappointed! the tongue sticks out funny, the eyes are smaller, the whole tongue can be shoved back in the mouth if wanted to. also the packaging is terrible. one of the teeth is permanatly stuck in an up position because it was shoved in the plastic wrapping.<br />If possible, skip buying these on line and find some in a japanese toy store.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.  I am downloading the next book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't a fan of the &#34;craze&#34; at first, but I caved and gave the book a try... Now, I can't put it down.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Fantastic story, kept you interested from start to finish. Would recommend it to all. So much more detail than the film.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Challenging and addictive, just the way I like it!  You have the main part of the game, but then there are bonus games in between levels that are completely different, and also challenging.  I'll be playing this one quite a lot.
B006DLP6JA|1.0|Unfortunately did not suit me or used it and I'm sad the amount paid him and I beat him h
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved the 3rd installment in this series. Glad to see it streaming on Prime after it not being available elsewhere.
B00BLCHL4Y|5.0|I haven't loved a TV show this much since 2006 when my fav. TV show ended. \\"Vikings\\" is full of action and emotion, and the acting is great. When I'm done with one episode, I'm hungry for the next one, and I can't wait until season 2. The show is dark, but I like that kind of stuff, and this is my new favorite TV show. IMO, it's the best show on TV today. I've also learned quite a few things about the life of the Viking age while watching it. A lot of bloody battles, death, and even rape, but really no fowl language. Idk why people are saying that episode 7 is missing, but I had no trouble downloading all 9 episodes. So many one star ratings are from problems with downloading or slow streaming, why give the show one star when it's the internet connection that's the problem? I find it best to download it from the Kindle itself, and download one episode at a time from Cloud. I had no trouble at all with it, and it only took about a minute or two for them to download. I love this show, I really do wish there where more then 9 episodes, and I can't wait for season 2.
B004LP601S|5.0|But I probably would have paid extra for the deluxe edition with the extra songs if I had realized this album is only 10 songs. Go ahead and get the deluxe edition.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This is such a fun game. My 5yr. old granddaughter has a blast playing it. I think Ive got her hooked on it.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is another review of this book as I bought it as a gift.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book any higher.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Amazing start to the epic fantasy tale. I bought the second book before I finished the first. Highly recommended -- but be prepared to be consumed! I have never carried my Kindle around with me before, but I do now!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|And I've played a lot of them: Field Runner, Night of the Living Dead, Fantasy Defense. This is my favorite by far. Customizable and integral, this is more than just building and upgrading basic towers. The game takes some real strategy to beat and master, and the artwork and animation is awesome. Love it!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a wonder full book I use it every day for school. My teacher loves it as well and the rest of the class does
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Would you kindly mind stop makeing me review your game. It is fun but for some reason this game needs your affection and won't stop till you give it up. Hopefully this 1 star rating will make it all end
0425263916|5.0|This book is so amaizing. These two characthers are so in love and they share the same history and do everything to stay together, love the romance!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is by far the best puzzle game I have ever played. It's extremely technical. The graphics are awesome and the 3D view of everything is amazing. I really hope that the next chapters come out very soon because I was disappointed when it was over. Overall great game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Nothing like the movie but still a nice read. I enjoyed taking a different journey through OZ very much so
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|If you liked the Lord of the Ring movies, you will love this film.  The main character was first seen by me in Love Actually and he is perfect as the Hobbit.  Everything about this film is beautiful--the scenery, the music, the pageantry.  My only negative is that I have to wait for the next part.
0425263924|5.0|I am so in love with this series. I am itching for another book. It is amazing how their past are almost so similar and they are destroyed by it but so madly in love with one another.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love the show! It has very interesting and different cases each episode! I will recommend it to all my friends!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I enjoyed And The Mountains Echoed as much as Hosseini's earlier books. Lovely characters take us on a journey that is touching and heartbreaking.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I can't give away an important development in the film, so just say I was sad to see what happens, but this is the best of the new Daniel Craig Bond films so far and I can't wait for another one.  Craig is the best, most believable Bond since Connery.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its combines two things i really like; temple run and minions :) i could this game forever if it werent for sleep and other stuff
B007N8RULO|5.0|Challenging and yet a no brainer at the same time. Simple and fun and you don't have to worry about your score unless that is important to you.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The charging element in my original Amazon kindle is defective. The company should be aware of this defect and should be providing customers the new hd kindle. The company refused to do that for me. I am no longer using the kindle and purchased a barnes and noble Nook for just $129. I have stopped purchasing products on amazon. You have lost a customer.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|As a fan of all the Die Hard movies, I awaited the arrival of the newest one with anticipation.  It did not disappoint.  Good fun!  More destroyed cars than any film I have ever seen!  Not an Oscar type, but real action and humor.
B0017VG69U|3.0|This  was a gift to someone. Do not know how the product performed. But then again who doesn't like Star Trek?
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I have a kindle fire HD and minion rush looks so fun! I can down load it then open an  it immediately kicks me out off the game. I have tried it four tomes now.  I wish I could play the game.
B00631HASU|5.0|This is my next to best liked game. This game does real well on my Kindle Fire HD. It is addictive too. It is a \\"must have\\" game. Enjoy.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|If you are a Tom Cruise action fan, this is one for you.  The stunts and action are great, Tom is very cool and believable, and the whole thing is well done.  Fun movie.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time and to see it in HD on our 52-inch screen was amazing.  We said the lines, cheered our heroes, hooted the villains, applauded at the end.  Bogie is forever!  \\"Here's lookin' at you, kid.\\"
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game I could do forever. Still wish they had more stuff but other than that it's great. I love this game
0061711292|5.0|This is a deceptive novel, which contains a story of depth and scope despite it's short length, and which I have returned to many times. The plot concerns the unconventional schoolteacher, Miss Jean Brodie, who seeks to influence a chosen group of schoolgirls - the so called 'Brodie Set'. Much of the novel is relayed through the eyes of Sandy Stranger, who enters Miss Brodie's class in 1930, and becomes a confidante of the teacher.<br /><br />Miss Brodie virtually wages war on the school; as the embattled headmistress, Miss Mackay, attempts to reign in her disturbing influence on the girls and find a way to force her to resign. It is true that Miss Brodie tends to tell the girls about her ideas and love affairs, rather than drilling them in facts, but they are still the 'creme de la creme' and her belief is in, her version, of 'goodness, truth and beauty'. This is, in many ways, a disturbing read, as Sandy looks back on her life as a schoolgirl as one of the elite 'Brodie set' and muses on her ultimate betrayal...
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fun site for ideas for events food home travel. I have gotten lots of ideas for my wedding & my home :)
1616550414|5.0|I bought this for my brother, as he's a huge LoZ fan. He and I both read through this and loved it. If you or someone you know is a fan of the LoZ series, this is a must buy!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is so fun to play it and the money is awesome I hope you enjoy it because I do.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|this was a great movie showing a new charcter from my childhood. I like the quality and the story line. NOT cheezy like wonder woman of old. NO theme music that sound horrible. It was good entertainment and links to the new Avengers.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I became a fan of Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes after seeing this movie. Their performances, along with those of the rest of the cast, are outstanding. After I saw the movie several times, I read the short story by Daniel Woodrell on which it is based. Although the screenwriter made some changes and omitted parts of the story, the film retains the rawness and authenticity of Woodrell's story. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is a great game because you need to think is this is a great game for any ages
0525953728|5.0|This is a well written and very interesting read! I would recommend to all. I read it in just a few days. Could not put the book down!
B008602KQI|4.0|this was one of my wish list movies and I am glad I saw it. I than saw it a 2nd time with my family. I am glad to have seen this and cannot wait to see the next movie
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This is a great book, moves very fast.  You take a breath at the beginning and don't breath again until the end.  Best book I've read this summer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game. Gets your mind going and gets ya addicted to this game lol<br />Youll get frustrated with the game in certain parts but if you relax and take a deep breath youll figure it out :)
1594746036|3.0|The photos were so intriguing, and I admire the author for his creativity and imagination in developing a story around them. The main character and his grandfather were very interesting characters.  I lost interest when the time portal appeared in the story and the book took a fantasy turn.  I guess I was hoping there were realistic reasons the characters were so troubled.  This is a great book for young adults, but just not my cup of tea.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|In addition to being a super talented songwriter and entertainer, Rodriguez was most importantly a humble man who inspired his children to dream big in spite of their overwhelming economic hardships. This is an inspirational story that everyone should see.
1401917186|5.0|This is the kind of book after reading which you want to take a deep breath and say, \\"Ahh, I always knew that, and now it's clear as day!\\" For those of us who identify deeply with one or more of these realms, it's like homecoming. It's like looking in the mirror and for the first time seeing yourself without distortions or compromise. It's like saying, \\"There are others like me; I'm not alone, and now, I know how to find them.\\"<br /><br />I've been a long-time researcher and teacher of all things metaphysical and spiritual. I am also the author of visionary/metaphysical fantasies, including the top-rated THE EARTH SHIFTER and CATHARSIS, Legend of the Lemurians. Being spiritual and scientifically-minded, but non-religious in a traditional sense, I initially found the \\"angel\\" topic a bit far out for my taste. However, I was impressed with the accuracy of Doreen Virtue's Archangel Oracle Cards. I have also recently started seriously researching the Star Seeds, Indigos and Earth Angel phenomenon because I felt tremendously drawn to this subject. After all my research and after reading Doreen's book, I realized that not only I saw myself in the mirror, but also that I've described different kinds of earth angels in my books without even realizing it (especially The Earth Shifter, Catharsis, Legend of the Lemurians, and partially, Gold Train)!<br /><br />My only criticism is that the book is way too short. I wish it covered more characteristics, more in-depth research, and perhaps, more examples. Some earth angel realms seem to be rushed or tentative, while others are given a lot of prime time. I realize that the research is ongoing and more data will be surfacing as more discoveries are made. I am incredibly excited about discovering more earth angel realms - after having read the whole book in one go twice(!), I feel very deeply that there are definitely more realms than mentioned in the book, and it appears I've discovered one of them already! Once I polish up my new realm, I'll get back to you all on that!<br /><br />Realms of the Earth Angels is the second, expanded and modified edition of the original Earth Angels. Comparing between the two, get this updated version as it covers more characteristics and includes additional updated research!<br /><br />I have to commend Doreen Virtue (and Hay House) on coming out with this book and on her dedication to this important, but neglected and misunderstood, subject. This is an exquisite and beautifully written revelation of a book!

0062255657|5.0|As with every Gaiman book I've read, there are such bittersweet feelings that it is over.<br />He reveals places that you never want to leave and yet, even though you are desperate to<br />know what happens to almost every character, you know that he has left you at the perfect<br />place in the tale: where wonder is on fire and your heart has been reminded of something<br />it had forgotten.<br /><br />It is too dark to be &#34;children's literature&#34; but too filled with wonder to be &#34;Adult&#34;.<br />He trusts you to find your own way back to being able to hold those two ways of being.<br /><br />I am sure there will be other reviews that will describe the book in detail but I just wanted to pipe up.<br />Never wanted to be a fanboy but after realising that each Gaiman book occupies a special place in<br />the bookshelf in my head, I guess I have to now admit that I am just that. And at my age!!!
B008PC1GF8|5.0|Not all of Karajan's almost obsessive re-makes are by any means an improvement on what came before but this, his penultimate Bruckner recording from November 1988 (the Seventh was recorded in April 1989) and one of his last studio recordings before his death in July of the following year, is undoubtedly one of his greatest.<br /><br />Indeed, some would call this the greatest recording of the greatest symphony by the greatest conductor and I'm not going to bother to debate that highly contentious claim; I would merely say that it represents a distillation of everything both the composer and Karajan were trying to achieve, and is one of the most profoundly moving and spiritually uplifting recordings in the entire canon.<br /><br />First, a few canards to dispose of. The sound is superb; not at all typical of the thin, glassy, screechy digital recordings which too often appeared in the early 80's but is rather rich, warm and full with a remarkably good combination of balance, transparency and warmth. The virtuosity of different sections of the VPO emerges clearly, especially the Wagner tubas and the trumpets and horns combined at the end of the first movement. The dynamic range is ideal; pianissimi whisper and fortissimo tutti thunder without distortion.<br /><br />Nor is this by any means an especially slow or indeed in the least lethargic account. True, Karajan is not as quick as the nervy, Romantic Furtw&auml;ngler (who uses his own edition of the 1892 first performance score) in 1944 with the VPO, or Maazel (who uses the shorter Nowak edition, in any case) with the BPO in 1989. Karajan is in fact faster in the last two movements than in his famous 1944 recording with the Preussische Staatskapelle Orchestra (missing the first movement and the last movement, astonishingly for 1944, in stereo [[ASIN:B000001SUN Bruckner;Symphony No.8]] - see my review) or the equally celebrated 1957 account [[ASIN:B000002S8D Bruckner: Symphony No.8]]- again, see my review) even though he is using the 1890 Haas edition with more cuts restored than in the 1892 performing version. Wand, using the original score of 1887 is the longest and slowest, even if that does exert a hypnotic fascination of its own, with its aureola of sound and the effect of waves incessantly washing ashore.<br /><br />Finally, there is not a trace of the supposedly &#34;smooth, homogenised&#34; sound Karajan was accused of imposing on the Berlin Philharmonic or indeed any orchestra he conducted post 1970. This is vibrant, thrilling playing of enormous impact.<br /><br />The climax of the first movement at 9' is overwhelming in its intensity, as is the culminating highpoint of the Adagio at 20'; the music unrolls like some celestial landscape before the listener and the sumptuous of the orchestral sound is extraordinary; the VPO simply sings in one great, corporate voice. To take but one example of the magic they create: listen at 7' 10&#34; to the gentle soughing of the horns over pizzicato low strings, repeatedly punctuated by the flutes - magical playing.<br /><br />Karajan knew how to make Bruckner's music breathe; he was a master of the long line and never lets the tension sag in this magisterial account. There is a sense of harmony and unanimity of purpose about this recording, perhaps enhanced by Karajan's knowledge that he was not long for this world, which infuses it with a special, transcendent quality suggestive of the next. Hear it for yourself.<br /><br />PS: Fellow reviewer Stewart Crowe helpfully informs me:<br /><br />&#34;This recording was made in 4 complete takes of a movement apiece, with the intention of patching sessions the following year after the Salzburg Festival. This undoubtedly gives the performance a more spontaneous feel. Sadly of course the patching sessions never took place, and patching has taken place from the original tapes- I won't point them out but on a few occasions you can hear the same slight imprecisions repeated.&#34;with more cuts restored than in the 1892 performing version.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game ever better than temple run this is awesome I love it cool. should have all stars.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|The all around talented Danny DeVito directs this nice adaptation of the classic story.  It's fun, sweet and good for younger kids.  Is the film a &#34;classic&#34;?  Perhaps not but the 9 year old girl visiting us enjoyed it and so did my 55 year old grumpy old self.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I have liked all of Brown's previous books.  i enjoy the way he educates and makes you think with every book until this one. I've read his books that covered government agencies, cyber security, art, history, and religion. and then did my own research.<br /><br />But I only made it about halfway through this one and realized I did not care any more: about Langdon or any of his problems; about how the book ended; or anything i had read in the book and would miss if i quit reading.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Love this show and cannot wait for the next season. Pleasant on the eyes as well!!  Story line is good but looses its focus a few episodes in, but keeps you guessing what direction it will go next.
0385535139|5.0|I have been a fan of John Grisham for many many years. WHen I couldn't find this particular book at any of my local stores, I found it on Amazon (imagine that)! No I look on Amazon 1st b/f I go elsewhere for any item I want/need.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is easily my new favourite book, I have cried, I have laughed, and awwwed at Augustus and Hazel Grace. This book answers the life question, and answers it perfectly
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The musicians are very good. They would probably be classified as easy listening but not repetitive. I would highly recommend this CD. I listen to it often.
0307474259|5.0|If you want to understand what is happening in your body that makes you fat, this book has a fairly excellent description to help you understand! there are parts of the book that are a bit boring and repetitive, but the essence of this book and the chapters getting into the meat of the issue are very good. I strongly recommend this book to anyone struggling with weight. Skinny people need not read this book!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|i loved the movie and it shipped quick. i could watch the move over and over. picture is great. thanks
B007DIQC90|5.0|This was a very good album by those young foreigners. I enjoyed every song on it. Hope they make a new one soon.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Its a wonderful story with a sad undertone. A family torn apart by powerty and war and how it affects so many people. Naturally also about how it all comes together and the impact hat has on the comming generations. I highly recommend this book.
B004I654WQ|5.0|We've really enjoyed having this at our home. Our little boy is just getting into cars and racing, and this is a fun addition to our collection.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Its about 70Â¢ cheaper to buy each book itself... Besides that, I'd give 5/5. Easier to buy this though. Good read too
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|5 stars if it came with digital copy and I would happily pre-ordered (Amazon price guarantee is quite awesome). 1 star for the garbage they call ultra violet. I guess I have to wait for iTunes to have it.
B006C1DH92|4.0|i love the app and if you love this one then you should just get the original fruit ninga!! :)
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Hollywood seems intent on taking every single classic story and making them grittier. It seems like Hollywood thinks we need a \\"realistic\\" version of fairy tales and that realism = gritty violence.<br /><br />The formula sometimes works but not as often as Hollywood thinks. In this case, I think it's a partial success. I think the grittier aspects sometimes work. I love the new dwarves. They have a much more forceful personality. They're a bit off-putting, which I think actually works for dwarves as they're from the fantasy realm. There's also a good mix of dwarf characters, from the grungy to the more mystical.<br /><br />The wicked Queen on the other hand is a mixed bag. Charlize Theron is wonderful in her performance. She manages to add a layer of pain and frustration underneath the surface of what could easily have been a one-dimensional villain. However, the attempts to give her greater powers fell flat. First, seeing her suck the \\"youth\\" of of people was a bit silly. Second, the special effects have that CGI look (note to directors: use CGI sparingly. CGI rarely looks realistic). The scene of her taking a \\"milk bath\\" really pulled me out of the film as it just looked like early 1990s computer animation.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart as Snow White is OK, but not exactly memorable. One gets the sense that she's a passive character in the movie, possibly because Stewart doesn't bring the character much weight.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is also off. It's clear that the director had trouble in the editing room and not surprisingly there is an extended version (which I haven't seen). Some scenes seem far too short, almost pointless. Others, such as the introduction of the Huntsman, don't have much impact. I suspect the romantic connection between the Huntsman and Snow White was also a victim of editing as it's not even clear why his kiss would be the one to wake her up. If I'd liked the movie a bit more, I definitely would try to get the extended version. Unfortunately, the distributor only allows Netflix to send the theatrical version.<br /><br />Small point - if the whole crux of the plot is that the wicked Queen feels threatened by Snow White's beauty, then it would have been helpful to have had an actress who was more beautiful than Charlize Theron play Snow White. Despite the age difference, Kristen Stewart just doesn't hold a candle to Charlize Theron in that department. It's not a big deal, but does kind of undermine the movie's narrative.<br /><br />Overall, this is an entertaining version of the Snow White story, but not isn't a great movie. 3.5 stars.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Its. So. FUNKY!! RAM, as it has come to be known as, is the funky can't-stop-listening with a futuristic sound album from Daft Punk that everyone can get behind. The playability of the entire album is astonishing in the fact that I've listened to it from track 1 to 13, with shuffle off by the way, through and through over and over and not gotten tired of it. The featuring talents such as Pharrel Williams and Todd Edwards are an incredible addition and fit right into the \\"robot world\\" of the band. My favorite track has to be... A tie, between all of them, with a special shout out to \\"Lose Yourself to Dance.\\" All in all a great pick that you can chill out to and rock out to at the same time.

B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|I cannot begin to tell you how disappointing I found this book. It wasn't the way it concluded so much, the destination if you like, it was the journey. It was so lacklustre and the passion that had imbued the earlier books and given them such drive and sustained reader interest was missing. As a consequence, I went missing (as a reader), my thoughts wandering as I read and I found myself being willingly distracted. Felt let down in so many ways, especially after investing in the entire series, Sookie Stackhouse, but mostly, Charlaine. Still, so many of the books brought so much delight, and for that I am very grateful.
B005HSL626|5.0|My three year old loves this game. It's great for keeping busy at the store or in the car. I would get rid of the ads, but hey, you get what you pay for.
B0047O2FDA|5.0|I love babycakes cupcakes, and this book not only has those tasty recipes but also the step-by-step for making vegan breads, scones and cobblers. Perfect for a new vegan craving the knowledge to make those essential and traditional sweets. Be aware, the recipes are almost all gluten-free so they call for less traditional flour bases (think gluten-free all purpose and garbanzo-fava bean).
B003M70O5O|4.0|I loved the character development of this season . you get to really know the rest of the crew not just jaxs clay and gemma.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was very good and it kept me intrigued but the end was  sad but all the same it was a good book
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This is great for all stages of development. At a play date we had a baby who was only sitting up one who was crawling and a walker and they were all able to play together with this toy. Takes some time to get it all blown up but once you do it is lots of fun.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Revenge is a great show enjoyed this season as much or more than the first! Cant wait till Season 3 comes on!

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is quite fun. It gives me my favorite guns from the 1940's. It is a great add on to the original Weaphones.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Mind blowing. I read this as fast as my eyes would let me and now I cannot wait to read Losing Hope.<br />You are awesome Colleen, Thanks so much for writing such an amazing story.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|I like it because I think it's funny and entertaing and good for kids and plus I like how they disgened the movie
B00ANA27IU|4.0|Clarke has the great ability to combine descriptive storytelling with believable science fiction.  The fact that a lot of his books are available to borrow just makes me happy.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Not sure why I didn't see it in theaters. Maybe I didn't want to be disappointed, as the reviews led me to believe I would be. It was really good, way that than I thought it'd be. Just watch it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Waited 6 months for this book, only to end at the same place as the last book, waiting for another book. I'm starting to wish I had never gotten sucked into this series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is a good fallow on for the \\" Hunger Games\\". Easy to read and fallow the plot. The characters are well represented and fit the story good.

B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I had the 30pin iphone cable hardwired into my factory radio. Once I got the iphone 5, it no longer worked. So I needed a new way to listen to music. This fit the bill and worked just fine.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|I'm going to start by saying that I don't love Sam Raimi's original trilogy. I can appreciate the groundbreaking filmmaking, yes. But the budgetary limitations didn't make for well-aging films. EVIL DEAD 2013 will stand the test of time. The effects are top-notch (mostly PRACTICAL, not cg), and the cinematography is excellent, with innovative direction. You can tell this had Raimi and company's stamp of approval. As for the cast, well, the movie takes off so fast, all they can do is react to the terror unfolding around them. SUBURGATORY's Jane Levy carries the movie, with a truly brutal performance. No, this isn't the original. There aren't as many comedic touches. This is straight-up, over the top, real deal horror, and I welcome it. It is a nice change from the cheap \\"reality\\" scares of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, or the screamo-meth-head Rob Zombie productions. This is a new classic, and highly recommended.
B0012CH350|5.0|Spend a little more to protect your grill. I love this grill and I've been tired of it getting so much rain. This cover is strong and very worth every dollar. Buy this, don't look back, has one elastic portion on the bottom, very nice touch.
B001AUKUSG|5.0|Otis released five solo studio albums in his lifetime, of which this was the third and the most commercially successful at the time. Like its two predecessors, it heavily featured Booker T and the MGs and the Mar-Keys and was arranged by Otis himself, who was a multi-instrumentalist although did not play on many of his records. It followed the formula of his other albums of mixing some choice original material with some songs associated with artists who were inspirational to Otis, notably Sam Cooke (Shake, Wonderful World, Change Gonna Come), and Little Richard (Lucille appears on his debut album)with whom he shared a home town. All were given the distinctive Stax treatment, so songs like the Temptations' My Girl were radically re-interpreted (My Girl was released as a single in the UK, with Down In The Valley on the B-side, and reached no. 11 in the national chart). Otis Redding was one of the first soul singers to break through to a white audience internationally and his song That's How Strong My Love Is (from Soul Ballads) had been quickly covered by the Rolling Stones. On Otis Blue he returned the favour with an upbeat Satisfaction, later released as a single and a staple of his live act for the rest of his career, including his memorable Monterey appearance in 1967.<br /><br />I've Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now), one of his finest compositions, had been recorded before the rest of the album and had already been released as a single. It was included on the mono album but the stereo version instead has a longer re-cut made at the two-day session that made up most of the album.<br /><br />Although Otis' singing style incorporated soul, funk, gospel and blues, he cut relatively few out and out blues, but on Otis Blue (perhaps because of its title) he includes a stunning version of Rock Me Baby, with some phenomenal guitar from Steve Cropper. This was a blues standard closely associated with BB King and was included in the sets of some of the West Coast bands of the time, notably the Jefferson Airplane, so was a canny choice.<br /><br />For those looking to acquire an original Otis album (rather than a posthumous compilation) this would make a good first buy.s of the time, notably the Jefferson Airplane, so was a canny choice.<br /><br />For those looking to acquire an original Otis album (rather than a posthumous compilation) this would make a good first buy.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Funny, quirky, entertaining. I'll probably re-read this book at some point. Even my wife would probably love it (and she's not into star trek)
B006LSZECO|5.0|WOAH. I ordered this book after hearing Reese Witherspoon bought the movie rights. I couldn't put this book down. I suggest this to any reader. You will not expect the twist and I am now a fan of Gillian Flynn.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|the author keeps you guessing until the last chapters. false clues lead you astray. wish there had been fewer long philosophical musings by the main character.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I could Not find a way to Delete a Location and while I can live with Ads<br />NEVER the Flashing kind.!!!<br /> A very good App other than those points.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good book, more of a psychological story. Worth reading but I won't be getting the next book in the series at this time; I probably won't re-read it either (as I do sometimes with books I mark as 5-stars)
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|another Superman Movie just with an Different Title this Time they call it \\" Man of Steele \\" but I really liked it in the Cinema in 3D just a bit dissapointet that there is no Directors Cut at the moment if at all....? Still worth getting it great Acting from everybody and good to see Russel Crowe in good form....? I give it 5 Stars even without the Directors Cut release because from the first to the last min. I was really entertained and hopefully this Time they will stick to the new Superman Actor and making another two or three more Superman Movies with him....?
B00571F26Y|5.0|I found this to be a fascinating proposal for many of my health concerns, including weight.  The arguments against wheat and whole grains in this book are extremely compelling.  I stopped eating wheat from the first day I started reading and I have noticed withdrawal symptoms over the last week which hasn't been easy but already I have also had improved sleep, my mood (often prone to SWING) has been more stable and I have better focus at work. My jeans, which I was about ready to burst out of and about ready to move up ANOTHER size have given me a bit more slack and a LOT more hope. For me I think this will be a hard transition but I am already a believer that this will end my war with obesity among other things once and for all.  If you are searching for answers as to why you can't lose weight or you are suffering from joint pain to headaches and digestive problems...read this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is fun with several ways to tackle the game - great for occupying your time.  Keeps you on your toes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Truly a great book that must be read after completing catch a fire. I truly loved the story very powerful and realistic towards the characters emotions and human nature. A recommended read!!!<br />HUNGER GAMES!

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This series is in my opinion, one of the greatest series that has ever been on TV. For those who are politically inclined and for those that aren't, it is a show that will suck you in from start to finish.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Please read my critque of Series One....just a marvelous series...marvelously done!!  Actors, plots, every performance...a delight. I am eagerly awaiting Series 3.
B001L2EE9Y|5.0|I love Joni Mitchell, and I own this album in vinyl - well worn from constant playing back in the day.  Now I have this in digital format.  This is a wonderful album - each song evokes a memory - and I can take it anywhere. This album comes from a period when it seemed that artists tried to bring a mood or story with an album, although I find that each song is a delight by itself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is almost like Iron Man 3 Official Game but with the hilarious minions. It's even more fun than Iron Man 3. 5 stars for the minions and Gameloft's hard work for our fun and hilarious minions.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|lots of fun.  good problem solving riddles.  Fun for entire family. Both me and my son worked on together.  nice game
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|Great game but the Amazon update is terrible.  Now coins &amp; items disappear after earned.  Also the update has ads - these were not in the game before the update. Game is supposed to have 3 missions, only 2 show.  The third constantly says Mission Complete.  The coin doubler is $5 on Amazon, $2 on Google. That's more than enough!  Downloaded from Google &amp; starting the game over.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Downloaded on my Kindle Fire 8.9... for some unknown reason, can't log onto Facebook. Can't sync my game, can't finish certain quests. So, I had to download on my Galaxy'S III, which had no problem logging onto Facebook, syncing my game... you get the picture. I love this game! But playing it on my 8.9 screen would be so much better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addictive!  Perfect mix of simple play and challenging content.  But the best part, of course, is  YOU GET TO BE A MINION!!!  BANANA!!!!
B0081L391C|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. The quality is good. i love channing tatum :) he is awessooooommmeee. I love it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book is a quick read being fact-filled and interesting from start to finish.<br />Diffuse  from most other biography books, this author hits all ofthe interesting facts and avoids the useless minutia that other writers put in just make their books have more pages.
B00003CXGG|1.0|In this movie, all you have to do to get title to a property is to kill the owner. So in this movie everyone is killing everyone else. Chinese gangsters are killing Black gangsters and vice versa. But here's the really crass murder : Jet Li's character's father has his other son killed. Why? Because his son is a loose cannon who might stop his father making more money! Filicide is included in the plot just so Jet Li can have a big fight scene at the end! There is nothing some Hollywood writers will not do for money.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is better than most crap on TV. If you like watching Honey boo boo, Glee, or American Idol then this is not for you.

B007Q1GJA6|5.0|I hated this movie the first time I saw it and now it is one of my favorites.  Amazing cast, ridiculously funny plot and storyline, great cameos, and the dialog is outstanding.  A must watch for all silly comedy movie lovers!

1609611543|4.0|Too expensive for me.  My grandson who is 27, follows this way of eating and he is so very healthy..
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I like the animation on this BRAINIUM version. The game is Easy to navigate and its addictive. When comes right down to it, no matter what version your playing, freecell is Freecell.
1451695195|1.0|It was just not engaging. I have a BA in Social Work and a minor is psychology.  Also, I am currently enrolled in a MA in Psych.  So, I have a working knowledge of the brain; certainly no where near an expert, but enough to be able to follow the psychological jargon. I am also a very Faithful believer in Christ and God. This is the 3rd NDE book I've read and it was TUFF to finish it! So many things he repeated over and over. He didn't explain thoroughly what the core and earth worm were or meant. It was just not an interesting book and I know these true life experiences can be written in words that capture their audiences attention.  I think it could have been written in much fewer words, and simpler. I understand that he is reaching for people who are of a scientific mind, and I think that could have been done.  I actually enjoyed hearing about his family's story, and his illness and found myself dreading the chapters on Heaven; or where ever it was in the 'cosmos' he was trying to say he was; the levels??? It was hard to keep my attention on the book.  Bummed because I had hoped to 'feel good' and now I'm just irritated I took the time to read it. I'd look for something better.
0439023513|5.0|I'm not a fan of harsh dystopias. I think they are unrealistic. It is not actually efficient to police every single person every second of the day... but if one does not, they WILL resist oppression. The problem with most dystopias is that the oppressed do not resist oppression in a realistic way.<br /><br />That being said: in this third volume of the series, there is a peasant rebellion. I do not think this is a spoiler, since without that there could not be a third book. I am very much a sucker for peasant rebellions in my f/sf novels! And this one was more realistic than many, with a new guard same as the old guard approach.<br /><br />Katniss is an ambiguous heroine. She's smart, clever, resourceful, and skillful... but not especially likable. A daring choice! but one that works well throughout this series. Her basic core of decency is a big help to her, though I did get a bit tired of her self-blaming; however, she's 17, and that kinda goes with the territory there.<br /><br />I did find the ending unexpected in several ways, which was excellent.<br /><br />Recommended- but read the whole series!- for those fond of dystopias and/or peasant rebellions. But be prepared- it's pretty harsh.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|This is OK , but when I got this app I thought I would be able to play the game , not be instructed as to how to play it. It is one of the reasons I got the Kindle , so I could play this game anywhere I go. I do not usually play games but this game is a winner.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|What else needs to be said here beyond that Breaking Bad may be the best TV series of all time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Terrific storylines, characters, and setting. Love every bit of it. Can't wait for the new season! Tune in, you won't regret it!
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|the AI is supposed to take pity on me at the beginner level, but it doesn't seem to. i have tried to play this 3-4 times at the easiest level, but i haven't won once. the enemy seems to have unlimited ships to send, but mine seem limited and i can't keep up. shouldn't i be able to win in the easiest level? maybe I'm missing something but as it is i have no motivation to continue playing.<br /><br />i picked up the free version a couple weeks ago and now got this one as FAOTD, hoping maybe it would be different.but it's the same impossiblegame.  maybe it's better if you pay against a real person instead of the AI but i don't have a real person to play against.<br /><br />i don't understand where strategy comes into play when the game is stacked against you from the beginning.
B004XZR63M|4.0|The story of the lessons the author learned from his friend's father does teach you something about how to manage your finance and inspire you.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very cute & fun game, you become,  addicted fast!  You raise baby dragons from eggs to full grown, make homes for them , grow food, & feed them ..... you expand the land to add more dragons and decor .... only thing is, be careful, its very tempting to use \\"real\\" money to buy gold and coins, but be patient, and it adds up, so you do not have to use \\"real\\" money.  This game is Free and can be played for a very long time, don't expect to finish this game quickly.  I have just played for 2 days and not even close to a finish. You can if you want add neighbors how also play and send them gifts, and they will send gifts back , I am still learning, but I like a challenge in learning how to play a game. Works ok on my Kindle.  I hear it is much more fum on an ipad andoid tablet,, I do wish I had one, but very expensive I do recommended getting this game!
030758836X|1.0|I must have read a different book. this book was filled with hateful characters. Was hoping for a total wipe out at the end. No such luck. Is this good writing? I don't think so.
0762449306|5.0|We used this on top of a cake, and it was adorable. The birthday girl kept the TARDIS after the party. It looked especially nice when we darkened the lights and turned on the TARDIS light.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I really like it but this app got lots of ads even if you paid for it ? It's annoying
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good game for the whole family. Plenty of time wasting opertunity waiting in the game.<br /><br />A must have game for all.
1594488886|5.0|Great Book, Sad of course, but still a wonderful tale full of twists and turns and well worth reading.  Never having been to Afghanistan I have no idea of authenticity, but it certainly makes you feel like you have been there.
0767802659|4.0|This movie is good, full of action and a nice science fiction movie.  Some of the actors must have gotten their start in this movie, as you will see they are very young.  Not a bad way to spend the evening with the family.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The whole series is excellent. The plot twists in each book, just has me wishing the author would write faster.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This book has changed my life. I've read it 3 times already.  Who would have thought that it all you have to do is give LOVE!!
B005898CFI|4.0|A great way to enjoy an armchair African safari with your family. There is thrilling adventure, hilarity, romance & great musical score by the great composer & conductor Henry Mancini. Delighted to see a different John Wayne playing a lighter role in this movie,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great entertainment and great fun.  makes you use your brain to solve puzzles and is very challenging.  love it a lot
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Great game, very challenging but very fun. I am slow to get the hang of it however I like the depth of plot and having so many options.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Fun and cute for my daughter! Good for young ages! I believe K thru 2nd graders would love this Tom Cat!
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|For a generation who have lived and loved in books and life. The use of archetypes is subtle enough to never be overdone and the story arc compelling. A triumph.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Anthony Ryan creates a vivid and sophisticated story that draws the reader in and doesn't let go. I happened upon Blood Song by accident and I am so glad I did. With elements of The Game of Thrones, but without as many story lines, Blood Song creates a magnificent world that I hope is the setting for several more books. If you are looking for something similar to Game of Thrones, this is your book!
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I guess Chris Lowe gave Neil Tennant a nudge and now this great music!  A wake up call after the sleep inducing Elysium. Keep it coming!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great graphics and it is almost like Farmville, waiting for the reefs to grow before you harvest. Kid friendly game!
0399157565|3.0|I enjoy reading the author's acknowledgements as it helps me--the reader--to pull together the author's intentions, and I really needed to do that after reading this book---not that I didn't enjoy it--I did. I like the characters, and in fact the best new characters in this book were turtle, cat and dog. This book is far more about her characters and relationships, leather-back turtle--Dinosaurs--Tar-Sands with several murders loosely tying them together. But, here's the thing: I do come away wanting more of the characters...not the murders. Even though the ending was thin, I will buy what I hope will be a future Scarpetta novel, as Cornwell did a fine job of crafting springboards for her characters' future relationships.  3.5/5
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed playing  but  not enough levels to play.<br />Look forward to seeing more levels added.<br />Also, got stuck a few times and uses the cheating app<br />Very helpful.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Found this game to be very fun... challenging but able to solve puzzle game. Slightly addictive. And definitely worth a try.

B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Listening to Cecile makes you wonder how it is possible that this voice is only 23 years old. One of the best, if not THE best new voice of Jazz. I cant wait for her to come back to SF Bay Area, so i can hear her live!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Since the get-go, my husband son and I have not missed an episode.  Every Thursday I set the DVR so we can \\"Big-Bang-alize.\\"  This means throwing in a pizza, settling down in the living room and letting Penny....Penny....Penny....rip.  Jim Parsons has got to be one of the most talented comedians around.  But he would be lost without the chemistry between him and Leonard, throw in Raj and Howard, and then the slowly increasing female population, well, it's ridiculously funny. Amy, Bernadette, Penny...heck...ANY of these characters could have turned out to be cliche'.  Happily, the writing talent matches the acting talent.<br /><br />I remember when I first heard of this show before the pilot it was billed as \\"two nerds get the pretty girl.\\"  Ah what a disservice that advertising was!!<br /><br />We watch each new episode repeatedly, I buy every DVD set that comes out, and then we Big-Bang-alize in marathon sessions off-season.<br /><br />Don't stop at Season 5.  You must MUST get all seasons!

B008LV8TSU|5.0|This was an enjoyable book light, funny and well<br /> paced.  Now we need depth in the characters which I'm sure we will get in the following books. Pick up the book and don't take life so seriously.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Don't waste your money on personal trainers: with a little bit of experience when it comes to basic workout techniques, you can be super fit for the cost of a few bucks, and never even having left your apartment. I decided to add this workout to my running routine while training for the marathon (strong core is essential for long distances) and I love it. And it is incredible how much you can pack in less than 30 minutes! You go, Jillian!
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I loved watching this when it was on tv.. Could not wait to see it again in DVD...<br />Thanks again..
B006903GX8|4.0|...this is a good companion to all of the background information that really fills in the story and makes it more than just another soap opera.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is for a patient gamer. It definitely takes time to progress, but it worth it in the end. I play on my kindle and the only complaint I have is for the update. It's saying it can't find the page. I hope I can keep going because it's saying I can't play unless I update and its not letting me do that either. I hope i'm not done playing.
B005FFW46S|5.0|It's Terry Pratchett. If you like Terry Pratchett, you'll love this book. If you liked Downton Abbey, you'll get a kick out of the relationship between the main character and the servants at his wife's family's country home.
B0093QFM6Y|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera 2004 HD movie is superb.  The stereo sound and high resolution video are wonderful. But don't<br />get the lower resolution movie if you really want the best enjoyment.  You will see the plot and hear the dialog, but miss the<br />thrill without the HD version.  I highly recommend it.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|I have to say the delete scene was awesome. I wish they added them in it. It would have brighten up the situation a little more but I understand, Riley was making it more suspenseful for the audience. A mystery to the origins of Alien. Though I'm still wondering how the Engineer on the other planet but if you listen to the Alien commentary he kind of explains it. Everything in it was okay.

1250007208|4.0|I didn't expect myself to actually pick up this book. For one, I never really liked the story of the Cinderella and to read a retelling wasn't really going to change my mind about Cinderella. But when I did start reading Cinder. I was excessively surprised when I realized it may have the vague skeleton of `the Cinderella Plot' but it was a story that took it's own life and originality.<br /><br />Cinder is half-human half-robot aka a cyborg. Cyborgs, in this world, have very little rights and were considered nothing better than slaves. So, Cinder was the mechanic slave of her foster mother. All she does is work at the repair shop her family owns, eats, sleep and frequently get into arguments with her foster mother and her evil foster sister.<br /><br />I know, that sounds very Cinderella. But then the prince of New Beijing appears at her repair shop looking for the best mechanic in the city. He asks Cinder to repair his robot, Nancy. And Cinder manages to make an impression on him. Things escalate and the plague breaks out in the town center close to Cinder's booth, her nicer foster sister gets ill, her foster mother throws a fit and volunteers Cinder to the draft system. The draft system is where cyborgs are sent to become lab rats. They are then injected with the plague then injected again with the latest antidote to the plague to see if it works or not. Most cyborgs don't come out alive.<br /><br />I'm not sure what part of the book I actually liked the most, the hint of romance or the controversies and the dispute between Earth and the Moon. I'm not one for politics but in this book. I just want to get into it so I can find the way to get the crazy and disgusting queen of the moon off the backs of every one on Earth. She is way to manipulative and irritating to just let her be like that.<br /><br />Anyways, I linked Cinder a lot more than later because of her kick-buttery and her strength to keep going even after the only family she knew shunned her and society discriminating her because of her mechanical foot and hand. Having a strong protagonist like her to is one of the best factors a wonderful book needs to have. She was easy to relate to in one small way or another.<br /><br />Overall, I applaud the author for ending the book with the worst cliffhanger ever, and her tenacity to include a little bit of everything for different types of readers out there. If you're a big fan of Cinderella, Science Fiction and Dystopia, you will absolutely love this.discriminating her because of her mechanical foot and hand.

159463176X|5.0|Great book. I enjoyed this book from start to finish. The author has done it again, evoked empathy, created a sense of believability...
B006LSZECO|3.0|Everyone I know who has read this book is in one of two camps: it's a one-star novel or a five-star novel. Me...maybe I'm indecisive but I'm stuck at three. The first 142 pages don't even deserve one star. But everyone told me to stick with it so I did. The unexpected twists and turns were truly brilliant...five-star quality. But in the end, there was not one character in this entire story that I could latch on to; not one I could identify with. They were all so overly _________ (fill in the blank: psycho, ignorant, devoted, obsessive, all-American, disgusting) that it never felt real. The key to a five-star novel for me is that while I am reading it, the author can grow an obviously unreal story into something that becomes part of my reality. This one didn't reach that mark.
B00079018K|5.0|Usually when I buy albums they have one song I like, and then I find more songs to enjoy in that album like U-boat, and butcher blues. (The bad part is that U-boat is 10minutes long and it's a 3 minutes song so it's just quiet for 6 minutes and then play reason is treason)(Still a good song!!!!!!!!)
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I just finished reading, \\"Beautiful Disaster,\\" by Jamie McGuire. For hours, I felt like I was \\"hanging out\\" with my best friends: Abby, America, and Shepley. But, the entire time, I was *swooning* over Travis 'Mad Dog' Maddox.<br /><br />Some may see Travis Maddox as a bloodthirsty, shameless, womanizing, tattooed badboy.<br />- He is notorious for his bad choices: a quick temper with violent outbursts.<br />- He is dangerous: a fierce fighter in an underground circle.<br />- He is a stud: bagging multiple, beautiful women in one-night stands.<br /><br />(Quote) \\"He Oozed Sex And Rebelliousness With His Buzzed, Brown Hair And Tattooed Forearms.\\"<br /><br />Women just can't say \\"NO\\" to Travis...UNTIL Abby Abernathy comes along. She is Travis's polar opposite. She's an innocent, good girl trying to escape her troubled past with her father. She is level-headed, strong spirited, and unimpressed with Travis's obsessive, domineering ways. She challenges him and is not afraid to stand up to him and say no.<br /><br />(Quote) \\"I've Heard You're The Only Person Who's Allowed To Put Travis In His Place. That's An Honorable Title.\\"<br /><br />Abby earns Travis's respect, and they form a close friendship. When the line becomes blurred, their friendship blossoms into something more. Travis begins to show his softer, vulnerable side. He is kind, giving, charming, intelligent, protective, caring, and most of all, loving. He wants to win Abby's heart.<br /><br />(Quote) \\"I Love You More Than I've Loved Anyone Or Anything, Ever. When You're Around, I Don't Need Booze Or Money Or The Fighting Or The One-Night Stands...All I Need Is You. You're All I Think About. You're All I Dream About. You're All I Want.\\"<br /><br />Travis and Abby form a complex, codependent relationship. They argue and put each other through the ringer. But through it all, they love each other deeply, learn to forgive, and become better versions of themselves.<br /><br />If you love an insanely hot, flawed Alphain your fiction, fantasy world, then you will find Travis to be simply irresistable ~ the perfect blend of good and bad that melts your heart! My rating: 5 stars!

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The Dark Knight was absolutely a 5 star Batman movie. While not quite as good as Batman Begins,The Dark Knight is clearly a movie that gets everything right. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is beyond spectacular. It's worth watching this movie for the Joker alone because Ledger is that good in the role. The Joker has always been the strongest Batman villain and the Dark Movie is no exception. The plot itself is one of the best and most complex we've had in the Batman franchise. And the character development of Batman is awesome. In a way,Batman makes a major sacrifice at the end of the film because he believes he can be most useful to Gotham by being the fall guy. And like Batman Begins,The Dark Knight is a dark and serious movie from start to finish. Nolan's Batman films get away from the horrible campiness and stupidity of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin and return Batman to dark realm of the Burton films. But Nolan's films take it to another level because they feel more realistic than Burton's. The Dark Knight is a 5 star movie by all measures. is

B008JFUO0Y|3.0|I didn't see this one on the cinema, so this is a review of the Blu-ray movie. I should also say that I have seen the original but am not really interested in making a lot of comparisons. Suffice it to say that this is not a lame scene-for-scene remake and the original remains a more ferocious piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />After all of the hype surrounding the movie, especially the awesome red band trailer, I was very surprised at how tame the movie actually was. It wasn't scary and it was even particularly gory, at least by today's standards (Day of the Dead is way more gory and that was made around 16 years ago). The editing is so tight you get the feeling that a ton of footage ended up on the cutting room floor and that something is missing. Sort of like the feeling you get when watching an edited for TV R-rated movie. The director did not leave enough time to build suspense, tension, and dread. As a result, what should have been scary moments fell flat.<br /><br />The acting was decent and the actors likable enough, the effects very well done, the cinematography atmospheric. The script could have used more work as some of the dialog took you out of the action and some of the action defied logic.<br /><br />All of that said, I enjoyed the movie, would watch it again, but like many others I was hoping for more...

B00BI745AA|3.0|Well, it is painfully obvious who in this cast is a broadway star and who was cast because they are a movie star.<br /><br />For all the press Russell Crow got for his musical chops, I don't even think he was the worst.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Almost everything that I have to say had been written already so the least I could mention is I went to see this movie expecting less because of all the previous Superman movies that I've watched. By far this is the best yet. An awesome full length movie with about 80% intensifying action, lots of great cinematic effects, especially the 3D version. And the leading actor (I didn't even care about his name) is cut like a hunk which fits him for the role. I think he qualifies for a second which I hope will be as good if not better.

B005LAIIKI|2.0|--SPOILERS--<br /><br />Liked it more than I expected to.  I'm a middle age african american woman and I read reviews that said the film used the N word alot, and as I hate that word and everything it stands for, I expected to dislike the film and watched it out of curiousity (free for library patrons), and found I liked parts of it.  With my aversion to the word, I muted the film and watched it with subtitles, which helped me tolerate the word as best I could.  well structured film story (especially first act, weaker third, but that's due mainly to poorly realized DiCaprio and his sister's characterizations).  all the actors were good.  I thought of it as a cross between Cinderella (had Cinderella been an african american male slave in pre-civil war america, with a fairy godfather (the german) instead of a fairy godmother), and Luke/Obiwan mentee/mentor relationship, rite of passage story (though Jamie Fox is alittle \\"seasoned\\" for a mentee (Christoph (django's benefactor) refers to him initially as young django, yet Christoph himself doesn't seem that much older than Jamie, so writer/director was pushing it there).<br /><br />I thought the film highly romantic as the german character not only rescues django from slavery, but trains and mentors him, offers him a lucrative job (where he earns thousands of dollars during the course of one winter season when most people likely earned only hundreds during their lifetime), and helps him locate and free his wife.  Basically in django unchained we see django win the fairy godfather lottery.  Some caucasian american viewers criticized the film for showing an ugly part of american history, but really, the characters I assume the viewers disliked, the caucasian males in dominant societal and business positions (slaveowners) were mitigated by having django's mentor be caucasian and male, and he's obviously a good guy.  doesn't matter that he's german and not american: he's the kindest and most generous person in the story, soMr. Tarentino (sp?) was not being anti-caucasian or anti-male, and american slavery existed and it wasn't pretty, no reason not to use it as a backdrop against which to set a mentee/mentor, rite of passage story.<br /><br />Hyper bloody film similar to Kill Bill's cartoony violence and so usual for this director.<br /><br />Mostly unusual because don't often see african american male slaves from this period in history end up as winners in hollywood film stories, which of course makes sense as no for profit business wants to alienate a significant customer base (caucasian americans), but I think Tarentino (sp?) mitigates this by not only chosing his mentor wisely (making one of his heros male caucasian) but also creating powerful house slave and paramour characters who did nothing to help their people, but instead used their positions to further ingratiate themselves into the affections of their owner.  In my opinion then, the characters I would have more liked to see fully fleshed out were the Samuel L. Jackson character and Leo DeCaprio's paramour (I think her name was Sheba); those characters would have really been interesting to explore and understand, but at least the writer included them, and they added a complexity to the story which cut across the cartoony, shallow presentation of the slaveowners.<br /><br />I wonder if these two roles were included to suggest that some african american slaves had some power in their slavery - historically it is likely a very tiny percentage of them did, but I'd guess that 99.9% of them did not, so it's disingenuous to cast a star of Samuel L. Jackson's stature in the role of head house slave, Stephen, and show his great physical and psychological intimacy (i.e., power) with the DeCaprio character; by adding such star power to that character, the writer in my opinion suggests that some african americans participated in the american slave trade and benefited from it.  Again, possibly true, and if so, very likely an extremelytiny percentage.  To my mind, just another way writer/director is showing he is not championing african americans by presenting this story, but merely using this time period in american history to generate the highest amount of \\"talk\\" factor to generate ticket sales.<br /><br />Speaking of the slaveowners, I'd have also preferred a more understandable and believable presentation of the Leo DiCaprio character, and his sister, who are the weakest links in the story, in my opinion.  For instance, when he set dogs on the man who refused to fight anymore, losing $200 in the process, would have helped to show why he was willing to lose $200.  I think by having DiCaprio and Django staring at each other was supposed to imply a competition between them, but I think maybe men might have understood that: as I'm a woman, I would've preferred something more clear cut - why would a businessman willingly lose $200, when in those days $200 meant a whole lot.  Also, why was DiCaprio character so miffed after he flipped a slave he'd owned for what, a few months, for a huge profit, to the extent he was willing to blow the entire deal.<br /><br />Whatever Mr. Tarentino meant by DiCaprio's behavior, just wasn't clear enough to me.  Having a psycho, macho, wealthy guy you don't have to clearly explain is fine if your audience is psycho, macho, wealthy guys; for the rest of us, we need to understand his motivation and I just didn't get enough information to understand him.  I wish the writer hadn't given short shrift to DiCaprio's sister: she was played like a entitled, sorority girl - I wish she'd been presented as especially beautiful and a person in her own right - because her character was treated disrespectfully (as an airhead) by the writer, can understand why some caucaian viewers feel the film made southern slaveholders appear as caricatures.  She should have been written seriously and presented as beautiful as possible, and she and her brother's motivations completely revealed tothe audience.  It's easy (and lazy writing) to take potshots at citizens (via extreme characterizations) who are dead and who cannot defend their position or what they stood for.  Of course, I'm not defending slavery, which I've read is alive, well and thriving as I write this review (though I do not know specifics), but by failing to show solid character motivations of the DiCaprio character, and his sister, the writer misses an opportunity to show a truer face of slavery, instead of the cartoonish characters he presented, i.e., helping us see ourselves in those characters and some of our traits that we should discourage.<br /><br />Disliked much of the music (when I occasionally turned up the sound).  Nice touches of humor i.e., when django chose his first clothes, and the slave girls who were shocked by django's boldly stated opinions at dinner.  Very much liked the fairy godfather, Christoph Waltz (who presents as slightly dangerous in films to me), and of course, Jamie Fox was very good.  Samuel L. Jackson seemed to especially enjoy his villainous role and played it well.  Overall, if you can ignore the N word, film didn't suck - because of the excessive use of that word I wouldn't buy it had I available funds.  Enjoyed the first act the best, I think because Christoph Waltz was just an unpredictable lead character trying to help others in an unpretentious and matter of fact manner - which I like seeing in fiction, and in real life.<br /><br />Grade: 2 and 1/2 stars. Would have given it 3 and 1/2 stars but one half star subtracted for excessive use of N word, and one half star subtracted for slaveowner caricature (specifically DiCaprio and his sister); felt both were cheap shots the writer should have worked harder to avoid.<br /><br />Slaveowners were the villains in this story, and they just weren't well written.  My opinion, it's poor storytelling (though common in film) to under write villains - yet villains are far more important to a story (in terms of structure) than a hero/heroine, as they power the story  (example, Star Wars: what work would Luke have had to do if the empire wasn't running around acting mad-dog crazy, blowing up a planet, murdering innocent farmers and such), and if a writer doesn't take the time or bother to make the villains understandable, writer loses audience intellectual and emotional participation.  Example, Star Wars again, what if George Lucas had left out the meeting where all the top military brass got together to discuss strategy.  What if it just wasn't included, no stars in that scene, no explosions, so in hollywood terms the scene is unnecessary, yet George Lucas took the time to write and film it, and his editors understood it's importance enough to include it in the final cut.  why? because without that scene, villains later behavior in acts 2 and 3 wouldn't make sense.<br /><br />And if the villains make no sense, the audience cannot participate intellectually (or emotionally), and if the audience cannot participate, the story is a fail.  Audiences need a villain that makes sense.  we don't have to agree with villain's pov, but we need to know what that pov is, and it's gotta be believable in the real world. It doesn't have to be politically correct, in fact, an effective villain's behavior shouldn't be socially acceptable to the audience (that's what makes them the villain), but we need to recognize it as something a person(s) with few behavioral restraints would do. Believable, recognizable, those are key, important words in crafting an effective villain. I see film after film do over-the-top mad dog egocentric villains, but they don't work because the villain's behavior isn't grounded in the audience's reality.  For story's to work, it must use the audience's understanding of reality, with specific plot points, so that when a villain misbehaves, the audience knows why, and accepts it and believes it. story is a dance between audience and writer, without proper set up, and use of the audience's reality, over the top villains leave the audience detached. (I'll write a screenplay to see if I can prove my theories.)<br /><br />Regarding slavery, I know this film is fiction, but slavery exists to this day and the writer/director could have elevated his story by humanizing the slavers.  instead of making the DiCaprio character power mad and/or unbalanced and/or bored and/or whatever (incest is suggested by having the brother/sister greet by kissing on the mouth), he could have used his subject to give the audience insight into human nature.  Instead of making the siblings incestuous (weird) and therefore not us, he might have shown the dirty underbelly of why slavery still persists - that sometimes good people are willing to take advantage of the socially, economically, politically, educationally or technologically, weak.  It is not one of our finer characteristics, but it is the truth.  The best story's tell us the truth about ourselves, even the unflattering truths.  but we do have the ability to change, and sometimes just flashing a bright light on a subject helps us as individuals be more self-aware.  For instance, just taking an example, someone seeing a film where slavery is a featured backdrop might in future turn down an invitation by a suspiciously young looking prostitute, and see that invitation in terms of sex slavery, which victimizes children (and adults) throughout the world.  Good story's help us see our choices have an impact.<br /><br />This is a movie, so not the end of the world, and I'll look for the writer's next projects, which I hope will have fewer racial slurs.  In the movies with the slurs, I just won't buy them.  Put another way, I'm assuming Mr. Tarentino is caucasian, I don't imagine he frequents films where characters frequently use racial slurs against his own ethnic group.  Yet apparently he feels comfortable writing characters who drop N bombs left/right.  Notice he doesn't make film after film with racist slurs against jewish people, as it's well known the film industry has some jewish power players, and if he used racist slurs against that group, he might have difficulty getting some of his films made.  Easy to use racial slurs against those with less power.<br /><br />P.S. Just remembered another thing I liked - the shootout when the Chris Waltz character sadly dies, but where django fights off a mini-army which just happens to be on the plantation, liked that django didn't shoot a magical gun with unlimited bullets, but showed how a fighter used the weapons of dead opponents to extend his firing capacity.
B004GJXQ20|3.0|Well developed characters and a good plot.  I loved the last scene.  Leaves plenty of scope for more stories to come.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a fascinating issue every person needs to be informed about. The book is easy to read and understand.
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|I heard so many good things about this movie but when I watched it I just got distracted and my ADHD started kicking in.  I would not own this movie and I probably wouldn't give it another chance.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I don't want the book to be over. A great read that will keep you  wondering what will happen next.
B000S398WU|5.0|This is absolutely what I expected, I was searching for this DVD for already 2 years and now very glad I have it !
B007RTAR64|5.0|Totally am obsessed with the Hunger Games books.  Thought it would be lame but it really is an interesting concept.  I'm 30, so I understand I may be a little too old to play with my Barbie Katniss doll but I didn't even care.  My 6 year old daughter was instructed that she could never play with Katniss, she was sad.  Bad mom.  I totally played with the doll while watching the movie that night.
0307970299|4.0|LOVed this book from start to finish.  Even got the audio after reading the book.  Extremely relatable as well as intriguing
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I gave this movie the highest rating because it exceded my expectations.  The storyline was phenominal, the costumes gorgeous, and the scenary beautiful and vivid.<br /><br />I have already recommended this movie to everyone I know.<br /><br />I absolutely loved it &#60;3
B00122O34O|5.0|This is one soundtrack that I have on MP3 and Vinyl.  I had purchased it on vinyl years ago, love the orange vinyl!  Then just needed to up grade a bit when I got my MP3 player.  Some really awesome tunes on here!
B0025VLEM0|5.0|This had everything!  Action in some many funny ways, funny comedy and romance!  the zombies weren't really scary because the movie made it that you want to see the zombies actually.  the story made sense and the characters were really great together. Threre were some bloody scenes but you don't really get grossed out.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I gave it the highest rating because I was already a huge fan of Lord of the Rings.  This story falls right into the storyline of it.  I loved the plot, the characters, scenary, and costumes.<br /><br />This movie exceded my expectations.  I was really disapointed when it ended and look foward to the next installation.<br /><br />I've already recommended it to everyone I know.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|its a killer show, de video quality and the sound is amazing, all hail Rob the real Metal God, Richie give the songs a new vibe, glenn, Scott, Ian they are just insane. spechlees
B003INBOEM|5.0|It's a great telling of Bruce Lee's master that taught him all he knew. the martial arts were great, and there is action all the time.<br />truly a great movie.
B007KGXY0K|5.0|My workstation spec:<br />1. Two Intel Xeon E5-2690<br />2. 64BG RAM<br />3. Two GTX TITAN + GT 610 (I use TITAN as a replacement for TESLA card and 610 for displays)<br /><br />despite other reviews I would say if you are looking for system for extreme performance, you definitely need this motherboard. So go for which it is working great.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Robert Zemeckis did a great job directing. Some of the scenes are intense and fun to watch. I think Denzel Washington was great in this movie.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This is a great book. IT's humorous and easy to get lost in the story, I found it difficult to put down because the story pulls you in.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|This movie is hilarious. Not only were Hill and Tatum great in if, but the supporting cast were also. Rob Riggle and ice cube steal every scene their in.
1781162646|5.0|This is a great book. I found this to be a very quick read. Being a Stephen King fan, I was not disappointed. It is written in the same style as The Colorado Kid.
B003WE9TU8|3.0|Could do with more can't-put-it-down factor. Some of the interviews (the book is constructed of interviews) don't vary from one another that much.
B00008EYA5|5.0|The DVD Arrived before I expected it, in good condition as promised by the seller.  I was Adding to my collection of Jeremy Renner movies and this is a good one, even if he's a bad guy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This has little, if anything more than the zombie epidemic, to do with the movie...<br />but I found it to be a great extension either before or after seeing the film.<br /><br />So much more emotion and general...how shall I say...Ooomph! than the movie.<br /><br />No spoilers here, you've just got to read it.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|We thought the show was great! Interesting take on Justice and Injustice versus vengeance. Lot of growth in quite a few characters. Hope the show continues!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Make no mistake, this this app is indespensible. Get the free version, then pay the two dollars when you agree how useful it is. Great app. Use it every day.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like how you can find weather were ever you want.  This new version is harder to navigate.  Over all very usefully.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|Really, really was disappointed in this rendition of the X-Men saga even though I own the DVD.  I can grant that X3 had great fight and action sequences and the whole plot of the \\"cure\\" for mutant abilities commingled with the Dark Phoenix was adequately engaging as a story.<br />Having grown up with the X-Men comics, I always thought these films gave particularly short shrift to Cyclops in lieu of Wolverine- whom the audiences love and have demanded more of since the first one, as long as Hugh Jackman is portraying him!<br />Scott Summers got the bad rap of brooding EMO guy from the get-go and never really got to have his character develop in any of these films. He was always overshadowed by Wolverine in X1, X2 and a mere accessory in Wolverine: Origins. Yes, he had a very tough childhood that Wolverine: Origins makes reference to, however, in the comics, he eventually overcomes his insecurities and self-disesteem and becomes a great leader of the original 5 X-Men, him, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Beast and Angel, and a leader of later team manifestations of the X-Men and X-Factor.  In fact, the comics nearly always portrayed Wolverine as a short-tempered, hotheaded, loose cannon, while Cyclops was more cool-headed and even-tempered, if stubborn about certain positions, which was why he was the team leader. Cyclops would sometimes have to duke it out with the much more short-fused Wolverine drawing his claws and coming at Cyclops, who'd optic blast away back at Logan to get his point across until the two grew tired of their feuding to focus on the mutual baddies.<br />This movie ended in the worst possible way, suggesting the Dark Phoenix killed the man Jean Gray always loved and Jean Gray getting dispatched by the rival and character who stole the show of the whole movie franchise. Professor X being killed off was bad enough, but without conflict and losses that ensue in that conflict, there is of course no story and it could have been sustained had the movie ended differently.<br />I realize that with the X-Men, it's difficult to give bandwidth to all of the characters equally because there are so many. Some have to be emphasized and others exiled to the periphery. However, writing and killing off Cylcops and Jean Gray completely, in addition to Professor X on the casualty list, earns only two stars despite the lavish and generous employment of special effects on top of the action, action, action, that had little heart and lacklustered the overall saga continuity.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I am a huge Jack Reacher fan, and having only read the most recent four books, wanted to understand the background of his unusual and quirky behaviors.  I decided to start at the beginning, and although his secrets are still underneath the story line of books 1 and 2, I am wowed by the twists and turns in each book.  I actually had a bit of a panic attach when Jack got into some serious trouble that seemed impossible to get out of, and I had to keep reminding myself that he'd live because there are 16 more books!
0307352153|5.0|Clear examples, good data-driven logic.  Makes sense of the difficulties introverts face in a world that worships extraverts.  Does more than explain the problems, Susan Cain offers useful strategies to leverage the talents and gifts of introverts.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a cool game just like Subway Surfed.  It takes a lot of hand and eye cordnation I like it.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Great Condition, my sister really like it.  It was for a gift.  I am glad I got it for them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hubby enjoys playing it with our 3 yr old!  It's a great game considering its free! That's a winner in my book!
1609611543|3.0|The top of the book wasn't cut right in production and is torn.  I can't remember if that was mentioned in the ad or not.  It is ok, but a little disappointing.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Great movie that I am sure I will watch again, looking for suggestions on similar movies with plots like it.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|One of the more entertaining Sherlock Holmes movies (although the BBC television modernization is fantasitic) in the last decade or so. Granted, Guy Richie took some artistic freedoms that might not agree with the Sherlock purists out there, but I personally think it works out great n the end.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Could have been more era related.  Too much depiction of 21st Century mentality.  Or maybe this is what we've have evolved into in 2013.  Interesting
B008JFUNYG|1.0|All I'm wondering is why raimi and the guys chose to produce this screenplay. It's a movie that is similar to the original, but so are another 100 movies that have been made since the original appeared 30 years ago. A nail gun? The old machete thru the wall trick? Witchcraft? I guess the man who kills his daughter in the best part of the film is supposed to be the professor whose recording is played in the original that awakens the demons even though you never find out exactly who he or the rednecks are. Whats with the dead cats? I hate to say it but the make up effects in this version didn't even come close to the originals low budget creations which were actually disturbing to see.Hopefully they'll get somebody else to write Evil Dead 2.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|GRRM is a straight up genius. Thanks for this great read, looking forward to the next book in the series.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|No dislikes. I love it! Okay so ya. I want money and that's it. Yep. Yea okay. Concert please for Taylor swift.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This book was an incredibly amazing book. I don't know anyone who has cancer, but this book touched me so much.<br />The characters were fantastic, the story made me laugh on some pages, while on others I was crying, and I was very connected to the book. I finished this book in one day because I could not put it down!<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of John Green' s books. This is my all time favorite book, if you haven't read it , what are you waiting for?<br /><br />\\"This book will be a legacy\\"
B00A0MJA1I|3.0|So there's this guy that's tripping balls and flying around sprinkling &#34;fairy dust&#34; *wink wink* on kids and they all go on this hallucenation trip. It was fun but I don't recommend giving hard core drugs to children.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was hard to put down. The book started off kind of slow at first, then after chapter 3, the pace of the book picked up. You have to really focus while reading this book because you will miss little clues that turn into huge revelations. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The book is a great follow-up to a game of thrones.  The action takes on a different feel as much more of the world is brought into play.  The characters are more detailed and you start to get a feel as to where the story might be going in future.  I can't wait to jump into the next book and see what is going to happen next.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|But I honestly think even if you approach it with a skeptical mind, you will still be blown away by the results of the experiments in E-Squared.<br /><br />What Pam Grout does really, really well in this book is give very simple and effective experiments that help re-train your ability to see the Universe as a bountiful and blessing-filled place.  These are not magic tricks and spells, but simply exercises designed to help you understand your relationship with what the author calls the FP (the Field of Infinite Potentiality).<br /><br />Each chapter of the book addresses a different aspect of the FP and includes an experiment designed to help make that concept tangible in your own life.  I like the structure of the book because each chapter really stands alone so that you can work through the book at your own pace.  I ended up doing 1 of the chapters/experiments each week.  You could do it much more quickly, but I enjoyed really spending a week focused intently on and enjoying the discovery of each concept.<br /><br />My favorite part of reading the book and trying the experiments was just how quickly I saw the results of the experiments.  It was amazing how quickly my perceptions of the world changed because of this. I started waking up every day prepared to be amazed by something that I would see or experience.  It's an incredibly blissful feeling, and one I can thank this book for instilling in me.
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|Despite the commentary on corporations being able to own (adopt) humans, The Truman Show is entertaining and thought provoking. This is one of Jim Carey's calmer/more serious roles, but you can still expect a couple moments of characteristic outbursts and patented Jim Carey crazy.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|CD was very shiny and clean.  Plays well in our CD player.  The music is OK, my wife bought it.  I do like the CD though, very colorful.

B0076DELIG|4.0|I like mysteries and I have read all of Michael Connelly's books.  I would recommend this book, if you like mysteries.<br />The service was good too.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Perfect app! I've been looking for an app like that for a long time, and now, finnaly, I found Splashtop Remote Desktop! Recommended for all!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Well written and intriguing study of the greatest mind we have seen. Creative, daring, secretive, the era seemed to produce some visionary men whom truly left far reaching legacies. Edison,Westinghouse,Morgan,Vanderbilt,Carnegie,Rockefeller,all were innovative giants in their time, Tesla was innovative during and beyond his his own existence. A true creative giant.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I can watch my videos with my tablet off and I even watch the without internet connection. LOVE IT &lt;3
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a great game. It is very fun and easy to play. My kids love to play this game. I like to hear the voices and sound effects of the minions. Very cute.
B005544TRQ|4.0|this is a great show! lots of drama, some great twists and the cast works well together, can't wait for the new season
B00009AOBI|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out and I always will!!!!!!! Sam Elliot has always been a favorite.....Grrrrrrr.....And what an actor- Eric Stoltz- love him to this day....And Cher was incredible- who da thunk! Everything arrived in time and manner predicted. Another great experience.......
B002W1UEW4|5.0|watch if for the adrenalin, nothing else. at that, it will not fail. don't watch with anyone who objects to massive amounts of violence-
B004I744AS|5.0|Great little dictionary quick and  easy to use. plus ..I got it free.. a must try for you!  I use it mainly on.my kindle ..
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is a great game for only 99 cents! It has three different settings to run and all of them are free. There is the Dark Forest, Whimsie Woods, and Winkie Country. It has a lot better graphics then Temple Run 2. There is even a setting where you can ride in the balloon! Thanks for making such a great game!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child is the master. The character that he has created in Jack Reacher is larger than life. This is my third time reading thought the entire series and it will not be my last.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|This book is excellent on its own but its relationship with Bladerunner just makes it and the movie better. As a sci if book it is a detective story that reminds me of the Caves of Steel or Robots of Dawn or any of those Asimov books.  However his writing isn't so dry and its worth your time if any of my references interest you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game it rocks and I'm getting addicted to it.everyone should play this amazing fantastic awesome game it's gonna be awesome
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Definitely written for the younger crowd which guarantees a media giant's smash hit. I didn't care for the images of attractive young people brutalizing each other for food. I wish the author had spent more time defining the root causes of the planet's societal decay. I think she chose not to because the target reader quickly bores with such things given their limited attention span. The author is a good writer and I can't fault her for snatching the gold ring. Great book/movie for kids, although I'd be careful with children getting hold of it. I prefer something with adult intellect, eg., 1984 or Fruit of the Gods. [[ASIN:B003JTHWKU 1984]][[ASIN:B00DQUWUJA Fruit of the Gods]]
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Gotta love minions! Don't know if its more fun to run or watch him get beaten up!<br /><br />Definitely challenging but simple control
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very entertaining for all ages. Got very addictive fun for all. I would recommend this game for all!!!!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Excellent job, lots of fun. Well programmed, great game. No issues, and very addictive. Combinatio of action with a bit of RPG.
1400052181|5.0|The photos alone speak volumns and this is an easy read. Quite astonishing, and informative if anyone wants the truth.
B003FFEX8C|3.0|Person dies, person comes back to life with &#34;Cat-like abilities&#34;.She was an uncoordinated, shy, scared of her own shadow klutz before she died. No explanation as to how, not even a hint, only her love of cats. She suddenly has uncanny hearing, cat-like grace, the ability to fall long distances and land on her feet and hands without getting hurt. HOW??? It just happens. At least Spiderman was bit by a radioactive spider which makes it somewhat believable.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Was interesting to see back story of one of the most important captures of the U.S. Even though the writers took editorial liberties, it was suspenseful up until the end. Would highly recommend this movie.
1475143389|5.0|There is so much BS out there with people trying to pitch you the latest, greatest fad exercise and diet plan that I was really looking for someone who would cut through the noise and outline the fundamentals.  That is exactly what Mike does.  BLS tells you what you should do, what you shouldn't do and most importantly WHY.  Even more important, the book backs up the WHY with science and research.<br /><br />If you spend time at the gym and want to see it pay off the bottom line is you need to understand how nutrition, excersie and your body interact.  Mike lays it out and gives you the roadmap so that you can put in your time at the gym and know where you are headed.<br /><br />A must read!
B007SOQBCM|4.0|The most recent update has added login and search abilities, which is a great improvement. The only thing that is missing now is the ability to use chat.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Some friends and family members were disappointed in this film. Not Me! I read Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin (and several other books on Lincoln) a portion of the book this movie was based. This movie is exactly what I expected. Solid  acting, good flow, great story telling. Sally Filed, Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader were cast perfectly (although not sure about Bruce McGill) though.
