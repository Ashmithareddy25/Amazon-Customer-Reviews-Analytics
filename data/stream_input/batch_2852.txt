B00BTHWFEC|5.0|Very powerful record!  2 LP on 180 gram vinyl.  Actually came with 2 down load cards.  Sounds incredible on my turn table.  I guess I got one of the few left because the price jumped up 20 bucks!

0307341550|5.0|Gillian Flynn is my new favourite author. Sharp Objects is an awesome book, and I have read all 3 of Gillian's books in the last couple of weeks - I really hope she is busy writing!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book gets you extremely hooked after just the first two pages!! I am dislectsic so it takes me two monthes to read a 300 page book but I read City of Bones in three days! It's amazing how much a great book can do.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is an absolute joy. Informative, technical, spiritual and a real page turner.<br />It changed the way I treated my patients with foot and knee problems at my physical therapy practice.<br />Thank you Christopher!!!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|This was a fantastic remake, quite a few people would say that it's arguably better than the original even. While I think the original and this each have their own unique appeal I DO agree that this was a splendid remake. I've watched just about every horror movie you could probably think of (even the crappy ones like, SAW) and I would highly recommend adding this to your collection.<br /><br />Yes, it's bloody, the original storyline involved demons possessing people to use as a sacrifice so of course it's going to be bloody. It's not just people being hacked up though, it involves some real emotional situations one can relate to aside from just the horror aspect. The parts that are gory are very realistic looking and the movie doesn't just try to surprise you by making things jump out. No, this movie actually makes real attempts at horror and creepiness and in many ways it succeeds.<br /><br />For those who don't like this movie, I'd suggest you stick to the more mainstream horrors like Saw, The Collector, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Drag Me to Hell, etc...

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Really liked the book, but the end left me hanging, unsatisfied.  This is a book where you have to suspend belief and just go with the flow.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 of Downton Abbey is jam-packed with everything I look for in a series:  drama, humor, romance, excitement and fantastic characters played by terrific actors and actresses, especially Dame Maggie Smith!<br /><br />The only bad thing about it is the season ending (hated it!), but I won't spoil that for anyone who hasn't yet seen it.<br /><br />I regret not purchasing the entire first three seasons so I could watch them all again, and I can't wait until January for Season 4 to start!
B003QO8TDC|5.0|Flashdance with Jennifer Beals is a fantastic movie.  The dancing is amazing also.  Just a great movie.  The music is wonderful also
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|I got this as the faotd this past week.  I actually enjoyed the game and even played it a couple of more times.  Today I went to play and should have been on level 12 but it was on level 6.  I thought nothing of it and played again.  I exited after level 14 and when I picked it up to play again was back at level 5 this time.  Deleted!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This movie was a somewhat typical Tom Cruise flick. Some action, but the story was pretty predictable. I lost interest no long after the start. I honestly wouldn't waste my money on it. The last 30 minutes of it were the longest - I couldn't wait for it to be over.
B0064MGU98|4.0|The plot rather commonly seen in real life in series follows the plight of the attorney wife Alicia Florrik (Julianna Margulies) of a disgraced states attorney (Chris North) shamed from office by an expose′ of his sex acts with prostitutes and cooling his heals in prison. Some of the elements of the plot should seem familiar especially to Illinois residents. They are a blend of the shenanigans of pols in the canned series &#34;Boss&#34; and the real-life experience of a recent New York states attorney. In fact, too bad Boss is off the air. The two series' could have shot combined episodes with both casts of players meeting right here in Chicago and the north suburbs cavorting in a fashion that we Chicagoans see play out each day in the our local news media.<br /><br />We are just 3 episodes into the series however, the political hardball is sure to be thrown at the incumbent states attorney who ousted the &#34;Goodwife's&#34; husband Peter Florrik from his states attorney post with a sex-prostitute expose′. Down home Chicago for sure. We are probably headed for a chicken and egg future for the plot: did the series screenplay writers get ideas from the Chicago pols or do the Chicago pols (and lets not forget Illinois pols) get ideas about their next political prank from the Goodwife series.<br /><br /> Want to read more? Check out the daily Chicago Tribune newspaper for columns and editorials published in the state of Illinois now leading the nation as the most corrupt state in the United States.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This is a fun hidden object game, however, it is quite tedious and involves searching the same rooms over and over for the same objects.  They do mix it up by scrambling the words or making you find them in the dark yet it's still the exact same objects.  All in all, it's not too bad.
1490313370|2.0|What a disappointment.  And how presumptuous when some self-perceived guru thinks that committing his every rambling, uncongealed thought to paper adds up to a BOOK.  Someone should tell Althucher that his every mental sneeze isn't worth sharing with the world.  But then, he already knows that, for this is one of those self-help books that fall in the sub-category of Con Art.  The book itself is an example of what he means by &#34;Choosing Yourself&#34;  -- slap together something of no intrinsic value or merit, but PACKAGE it and MARKET it effectively and you can thus get ahead.  So go ye forth and do likewise.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I admit that I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. We have family movie nights with our 8 and 4 year old and I'm always looking for movies that my wife and I will enjoy too.  This movie has a decent rating on commonsensemedia.com, so we gave it a try.  I usually temper my expectations when it comes to animated films, but this one was really quite enjoyable.  My wife and I both enjoyed it as much as my girls did. I wasn't sure they could do so much to bring these fantasy characters \\"to life\\", but I am impressed at what they came up with.  I would highly recommend this movie.  It's not something you should be too worried about sharing with your kids, although there are some scenes that are a little bit scary...but so are a lot of other kids movies.  This one is not over the top in comparison to others I've seen.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I bought these to go with my AKG Q 701 headphones to bump up the sound with them due to their high impedance.  It works great and I high recommend it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Simple and fun game play is straight forward graphics are as detailed as they need to be.<br />Not sure what else to say but for a freebie totally worth it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game to spare the time, as soon as you know it an he has gone by and the kids also love it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I cant wait for more levels! this game is like a game of hide and seek for clues. more levels please.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Getting the movie took alittle longer then I expected and the movie didnt live up to the hype. Other then that everything was fine.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of the best book I've ever read! I've shared it with so many people that I had to buy another one and then a 3rd one. Plus I bought and read all of his other books.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I am not going to go into great details like other reviewers for they all did a wonderful job of reviewing the inner details of the movie. Its a clean family movie and not like the ones they make today. This movie is so much better than the movies they make today!!! But I will say that if you love this movie when it first came out you will love it even more now. They did a brilliant job with this movie. Its clear, loaded with colors and the sound is great. It takes you away to another world, especially with Julie Andrews in her prime. She was simply awesome in this movie and carried it with her God given beautiful voice. The songs are contagious and the story line is deep.<br /><br />So much pain going on in the childrens lives caused by their drill instructor type Father. So much pain going on in the Fathers heart from the loss of his wife. Raising all his children on his own while trying to determine if he really loves the woman he is with now and if she would make a great mother to his children. So much pain going on with the country as the Nazis are taking over and the Father not wanting to join them which makes himself an enemy of the country. Last but not least all the pain Julie Andrews character is going through fighting herself about whether or not her heart is in it to dedicate the rest of her life to God as a nun and then coming between the father and his fianc&eacute;e as she falls in love with him and the children.<br /><br />Bring all these things together and you have the perfect storm for one heck of a movie!!! Now that's a story line that grabs your attention and pulls you in. How does it all work out? Well, if you have not seen the movie your going to have to watch it for yourself. But I can almost guarantee that you will love it!!! Julie Andrews best film ever!!! Another MUST OWN!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it! Hopefully we'll get more companies supporting it soon but for now it's great to stream Netflix and youtube!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My six year old loves this game.  It confuses the heck out of me.  There is a lot of things to learn on the game.
0738711500|5.0|exciting, at a quick glimpse as i haven't dug in yet, a lot to learn but easy to follow instructions
B004R2DS9C|4.0|it is a nice size for holding legos and being able to zip down the sides is convienent. the lid even secures down
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I honestly had to take a break from this book after reading about half of it.  I found the first part very difficult to push through.  The way the accents are written when the characters speak took me a while to get used to and appreciate.  The language definitely adds to the depth and setting of the story, but is challenging to read at times.  The book seemed very drawn out and overly detailed in the beginning as well.  I set this book aside and read another novel before finishing the last half of the book.  I am very glad that I decided to continue reading it because the ending was suspenseful and unexpected.  As  difficult for me to read as the first half was, the second half was easy and enjoyable.  The author definitely took their time in building the characters and their histories, which may bog a reader down at first.  As their individual stories come together through a series of twists, the pace picks up dramatically.  I would definitely recommend this story and if you feel a little underwhelmed at the beginning, please do not stop reading.  The ending is definitely worth finishing the book!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I got this for one reason: Heath Ledger. If you haven't seen it, you must. You can not take your eyes off him in any scene he is in.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I thought the movie was very entertaining. It was nice seeing Matthew Mc C in something other than a romantic comedy. I liked the twist at the end. Also, it was a nice surprise to see Trace Adkins in this movie. He played a perfect motorcycle riding tough guy!! Enjoyed this movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Purchased this after seeing a road production of the show. Idina Menzel: I mean, what more can I say, huh?
B00821OX98|4.0|Very entertaining High production values gets a little silly at times, not sure about the ending<br />ran out of things to say
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|the thing would not stay tight so as soon as you start to cut bottle it shifts which sends your score line off hence your break is not clean, finally gave up after a few bottles i like my Ephram cutter better, I bought this one so I could cut closer to top of bottle and also bigger bottles.<br />Save yourself the money and just buy the Ephram
B004J18DBY|5.0|This book relates to the lifestyle I was raised in...religion, food, adventures, camping etc...I have a cat's eye too...my royal whiskey bag is full buttons inherited from my grandmother...lol
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Even with all the great reviews I avoided reading the first of this series for months because I judged the book by its' title, 'Wool'.  Wool?  Pretty bland sounding, I'll read it later.  My mistake. Halfway through the 1-5 anthology I bought the second series 'Shift' and just now purchased the third installment 'Dust'.  I LOVE post apocalyptic scifi and thought I had read just about everything.  This book was everything I've been thirsting for.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|seems to be doing it's job, will know more when more time goes by, but so far so good. You might just like it!

0064471837|5.0|There are books that you read and love. But when they're done, they're done. You had a great time, but it's time to move on. To the next book. To the next adventure. Then there are books that create such intense imagery, such depth in characters, such love for the world those characters live in, that it's impossible to move on from them. They become part of you in a way. You think of the characters, of particularly favorite lines, and the images stay in your mind as if they were fine art seen in a museum you'd committed to memory. This is the only way I can explain Sabriel (and indeed the entire Abhorsen Trilogy).<br /><br />As an adult you think your all time favorite literary characters may not change much. They're usually the characters you grow up reading... Alice, Anne Shirley, Ramona. So it's surprising that a YA book read as an adult can so easily stand in such good company. I count Sabriel among the ladies I grew up with as being a favorite character. But out of all of the characters in the Abohorsen Trilogy, Mogget has my heart. Even among those characters held dearly from childhood, he has taken first place among them. And what an astounding thing to do, Mr. Nix.<br /><br />I highly recommend Sabriel to anyone who loves strong female protagonists, well developed secondary characters, and world building that will stick with you for years to come. Basically, if you like a good story, you'll love Sabriel and the full Abhorsen trilogy.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|big improvement over first version<br /><br />great improvement over first hereon. speeds up rather quickly however. needs more goals maybe finding items.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun game cannot wait for more levels<br />please update soon. better than a lot of similar games.

0380713802|3.0|While reading this book stirred in me a desire to travel to every single place mentioned, regardless of whether the author liked the place or not, it's not a great story. The book is interesting, but not because of the writing. In fact, it's interesting in spite of the writing. This book contains a lot of, \\"I went to my hotel, then I got coffee, and then I took a walk,\\" -type of sentences. And I rigorously disagree with the reviewer who called the book \\"riotously funny.\\" It certainly held a few chuckles, and more than a few smiles, but this book will not leave you with tears running down your face. In fact, the practice of ending paragraphs by going for the laugh grew somewhat tiring and quickly became predictable. That said, if you have a desire to travel, whether you've been to the places visited by the author or not, or have ever dreamed of picking up and just going somewhere, anywhere, this book is recommended, if only because it makes the dream seem possible.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Without having had the chance to work with it in the field - I can say that this is a great knife.<br />Just holding it in my hand I can tell that this knife is able to endure a lot of abuse.<br />I've read stories about the sheath dulling the blade but I don't care. This is a great sheath with a nice 'snap' sound.<br />I took the trouble of wiring the sheath with paracord. I did the same with the handle, but had to un-do that because the sheath wouldn't close anymore. No problem.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|An enjoyable bawdy romp with some mid-evil witchery thrown in!  Sex is more like a frivolous undertaking in this movie rather than centering on it as they do in most movies today and calling it a work of art!  Mel Brooks would have been proud!  I've seen movies that were a lot worse and had better ratings so that is why I question the ratings here!  There was no lagging in the lines or the action!  I definitely hope they come out with a sequel as that is what they seemed to have hinted, in the end!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing the best game ever<br />Good graphics not blurry and great for kind and teaching  instructions to little ones. It is great

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Roku does far more than Chromecast, so I bought it solely for the beta function of the Chromecast tab on the Chrome browser which would allow you to put whatever you were watching on your laptop, etc. on your television screen.  It's very much a work in progress unfortunately.  The video on the computer was fine, but when going through Chromecast was jerky and would start and stop; voice and video were out of sync.  This seems to be a common complaint.  This could be a killer device, but not at the moment.  At $35 with Amazon Prime shipping it was worth a try out.  At this point, if you don't have it, don't bother.
B00A7KKPDK|1.0|I was looking for a 3rd book written by a female comedienne for my thesis to compliment Tina Fey and Mindy Kaling and had high hopes for this book... Like the other reviewers, I find Ellen quite endearing on TV, however, this book simply did not do it for me. I did not laugh once. Like another reader said, I don't believe I even cracked a smile. Disappointing, considering I was laughing and/or felt engaged with the writing styles of Tina and Mindy. This book has no direction, is a series of too short, 1-3 page ramblings of nothing interesting, heartfelt, or humorous. It didn't even feel like Ellen was talking to the reader, just spurting out random, disconnected words she strung together; most of the stories were barely interesting. There were a few moments when it felt like she was going to speak honestly and openly- some about women, some about her relationships, however, she fell short of any real self-disclosure that would be necessary to connect with her readers. I knew this book wouldn't make the cut for any sort of academic writing when I got to her random chapter on 'a dream she once had about you, the reader'... I don't think I read more than the first paragraph of that section as it was as boring and random as you would expect from someone telling you about their dream, except this one felt completely disingenuous, as she was trying to force a connection with her readers that revolved around made-up scenarios.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|If there were a complaint, it would be waiting for energy to resupply. To fun to put down. More free cash would be pleasant.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I had watched the movie for yrs. And when I seen it Thursday Amazon, I thought anything they throw out there must be good, I wasn't' wrong.. Good book
B0010T0OCY|3.0|If you like 1940's style campy retro film noir; if you like the filming style in the later Batman movies; if you like the big-machine message of the classic Metropolis, and the campy Dr Who etc Brit sci-fi, this flick is for you: it mixes all those genres.  I rented it for the actors.<br /><br />Plot starts and ends nowhere, all on one day (classical Greek drama format), and somehow that is the point. Worth watching only once, unless you're into the technicalities.<br /><br />On a technical level, meaning cinematography, special effects, film editing, directing, and especially acting, this film excels, is worth rewatching.  Else, meh.  No backstory of significance, and no ending.  Again, seems like that was the point.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I like it, it's one of them where they hide stuff and you have to find it, this one is good, I am still looking for the fifth object, I'll find it yet...
B000058A1G|5.0|...unknown bands from the middle sixties period that truly deserve the term \\"Overlooked Classic\\". How this band managed to get signed by George Martin and not even make a dent in the British charts is anyone's guess. Often mentioned as peers of the Who and Small Faces during the \\"Mod\\" era I would stop short of making that comparison but I can think of 10-15 bands from the 1966-67 period that had hits on both sides of the Atlantic that weren't even remotely as good as these guys.<br /><br />While vocalist Reg King did not possess much range he more than made up for it with a smooth \\"blue eyed soul/pop\\" delivery that rivaled any of the better known mod/northern soul singers of the period. \\"I'll Keep Holding On\\" and \\"Shadows and Reflections\\" are both period classics and several others such as \\"Baby You've Got It\\" and \\"In My Lonely Room\\" aren't far behind. The only weak songs here (imho) are \\"Since I Lost My Baby\\" and \\"Just Once In My Life\\", both cover songs that require a greater range than King was capable of.<br /><br />Instrumentally the band is top notch and the back ground vocals supplied by Alan \\"Bam\\" King and Mike Evans are spot on. Alan King, Evans, and drummer Roger Powell carried on after Reg King left for a solo career, rechristened themselves as Mighty Baby, releasing an exceptionally good self titled recording in 1969 (also ignored but still available on CD) and Alan King was later a founding member of Ace (\\"How Long\\") as well. This is one of a very few instances where you can believe the \\"Lost Gem\\" hype and discover a fine slice of British pop that missed the boat but still delivered the goods. Highly recommended.

B009B1UZ4K|5.0|Great reinterpretations, I would've loved to see my fave, Impossible Princess, represented amongst these re-dos, but stellar set none the less.  Get the bonus tracks, there are some good ones out there that maybe should have made the &#34;official&#34; set before some on here, but that is subjective.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I purchased this recently and was very excited to receive it and - I was NOT disappointed with this great DVD box set!  This is the best documentary about the Eagles that has been put out, IMO!  I just wish that they would have gone more into the issues with Don Felder (who I miss greatly in the current lineup!  Steuart Smith is NO CLONE of Felder, IMO.  He's just up there, a hired hand, copying (to the best of his ability) Felder's and Leadon's legedary solos.  WE WANT FELDER BACK!!!<br /><br />One gets the feeling from watching the documentary that both Don Henley & Glenn Frey are just full of themselves - and that turned me off about them in a big way.  Now, Joe Walsh and Randy Meisner are different.  They seem so much more pleasant and easier to get along with if having a conversation with them (yes, I would LOVE to meet Joe Walsh - since I'm a musician, myself, and get the low-down on some of those CRAZY guitar riffs he does!)<br /><br />All in all?  If I were you, I would NOT pass this up!  Granted, there is some profanity and a little bit of nudity but....DON'T HESITATE TO GET THIS!!!
B00007KWHN|4.0|I have been going back through these guys catalog since seeing them in concert performing 3 full albums, including this classic. Set the bar for progressive rock and still remains timeless.  The main bonus worth having is a studio take of Clap, but the other single edits might come in handy or a mix tape, I suppose, if you dobt a e room for the album cut, that is!!!  See them live, it's worth it, even without Jon, the musicianship is amazing!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|If it were possible I would give this book more stars. I enjoyed every page.  Loved the characters the were so real. Loved the journey and the way the story developed along the way. Highly recommended.

B00338QENI|5.0|There is no way to put into words just what an amazing book this is. Learning about the HeLa cells and Henrietta and her family as a parallel story was intriguing, insightful, and eyeopening.

B00AEFYCDW|3.0|the movie wasnt what i was expecting. I wouldnt recommend the movie, but if you got to see it is a &#34;ok movie&#34;
B0037VNX44|4.0|First just let me say that Tom Hardy is fantastic as BRONSON and without him I'm not sure you have much of a movie.  But you do get Hardy and his performance alone is worth seeing the film.  If you're like me, you are curious about the movie because of Refn's direction of Ryan Gosling in DRIVE (FANTASTIC Movie!) and you couldn't wait for their more recent pairing in ONLY GOD FORGIVES (Absolutely TERRIBLE movie.)  BRONSON falls somewhere in between with less action but far more character development then both of Gosling's characters combined (this is not a knock on Gosling just a statement of fact.)  The movie is not as pretty as Refn's other films nor is the soundtrack as entertaining but I doubt you'll get a more in depth analysis of one character in arguably any film.  The movie is titled BRONSON and is entirely about &#34;Charlie Bronson.&#34;  While I would not rush out to tell everyone that they need to see this film I honestly can say I would never tell someone not to watch it.  If you love in depth character study or just want to see an actor do a superb job of demonstrating this, BRONSON and Tom Hardy 's portrayal of the title character is well worth your time.

B00005JNS0|5.0|My son watches this movie over and over on road trips. I ask if he wants a new movie, but the answer is always no. I wish Disney wouldn't have put in the parts where the semi calls McQueen an idiot and I believe stupid is said another time. My son doesn't need to learn those words any sooner than necessary. However, we love the movie and if he does pick up some of that stuff we can explain that it's wrong and move on. I never get tired of watching it with him.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app makes it very convenient to check my mail on my Kindle Fire. One click brings it up! Nice!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's a good game just wish there wasn't a long time in between the time when they give more coins to play
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|shane is a classic this got to be the best western ever made alan ladd is great in this classic western it really looks wonderful in bluray.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|But not great.  I like his books and this one is good.  Much better than most mystery books, and a good story.
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|I like the romance mixed with the combination of great humor.<br />We used a quote from the move at my nieces wedding shower!
B004LROUNG|5.0|A bit of Elmore Leonard in this one, but a good story of a practical lawyer doing what lawyers do--sue the bad guys and putting up with the jungle that the law has become.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Yes fun  yes yes loved it so much fun fun fun<br />More fun than blasting a water gun  yes yes so much fun
B00CA4S27W|4.0|The cd is good but the dvd is dull and not worth the extra cost so save the coin and just get the cd
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies ever - for kids and adults alike. This movie is a must have.
B009AY04A8|1.0|The entire game is blah, blah, blah...... absolutely stupid conversations and loading and loading and loading again, just played for 5 minutes and that time was enough for me to hate it, don't download this game.....
B007BVOEPI|5.0|To much nudity no need for it with a story like u have.  It's one thing to read about all the slaves being naked and another to see it.
0374533571|5.0|I love that book 'cause it's emocional sorta like a funny story too  Pat Peoples is a troubled men and then He meets Tiffanny whom will change his life
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love it but it is hard to get lots of pony and I move on to a lot of levels fast I got to four levels in a day.
B007R21JJK|5.0|This motherboard has it all! The on board graphics will rate 6.5 in Windows Index Rating. Running games will require lowest graphics settings for smooth gameplay but if you're getting this you should be running a GPU or 2 anyways. Packaging great, Love the LED error readout. All around couldn't be happier with it!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Simple, small and easy to set up. A good replacement if not buying the apple TV. Reception is poorer than the apple TV.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game so fun I was really looking forward to free ride but other than that 5 star game.
B001HN6922|5.0|My grandson has been in love with this movie and all the character since he was one year old.  I needed to get the second movie, as he knows the first Cars work for word!
B006O2QNOU|1.0|I watched this based on the average rating of 4 stars.  Are you kidding?  This movie was always starting, and eventually went nowhere.  Maybe viewers were intrigued around the time of financial meltdown in 2008, but this movie doesn't even come close to explaining what happened.  It amounts to watching Wall Street traders sitting around on pins and needles for 1h 44min, thats it, thats the story.
B000683VI4|5.0|Recommended by my cousins, a terrific, meaningful movie with a message.  Will be watching this several times, over and over again.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It cleared up a lot of issues and questions for me. One of the best books I've read on this topic.
0679882820|5.0|My baby loves the bright colors and silly words. Can't wait until she is old enough to make the sounds with me. These books are a great, portable size and sturdy enough I don't have to worry about her grabbing at the pages as we read.
B005HSL626|4.0|well i put it on nabi jr as it goes it stuck a couple of times my son got angry with as it froze on the nabi jr but it works and he's happy
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I have enjoyed watching this to see what all the buzz was about. Good character development, lots of surprises. A few people you love to hate...
0765325950|5.0|Recipient  loves it, don't know why. I on the other hand don't get this stuff at all. Is that enough words
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is a addicting app. I play it every day. I always trying to always trying to beat the requirements to get the award. I think you should definitely down load the app . It is definitely a addicting app!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Omgomgomg dude just read it dont hesitate just do it and cry and stuff omg so good like omg you dont even know
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Love this movie.  So do my grandchildren!  We always have &#34;move time&#34; when they visit and works well in the car.  Great story.  Very cute.
B009GEPBA0|3.0|3 stars, but only because it was Connery's last Bond movie. (2 stars would be more appropriate...) The original &#34;Thunderball&#34; was a much better movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This clock offers multiple faces and is extremely functional. Multiple alarms can be set, with an endless combination of week days. Snooze timer can be different for each alarm. There are a variety of alarm tones and volume can be adjusted to taste. A real winner.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Daniel Craig, action and Blu-ray.  Can't be beat.  We'll wear out the disc if we keep on repeat playing of this movie.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I appreciate that I can set multiple alarms for any combination of days. I can decide on length of time for snooze time and it can be different on each alarm.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Absolutely outstanding!  We watch this every now and then, over and over.  Sound and picture quality is fabulous.  Just like being in the movie theater.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|This app is great and it took me a while to understand  how to use the app, but the other than that it's awesome.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|the continuation of some stories...beginning some new. you don't put it down...rich, twisting plot lines and intrigue...SO very worth the ride
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Its not the best Product but its good once you get used to it. I would recommend it for mmorpg gamers
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|GREAT MOVIE AND A TON OF EXTRAS. BE SURE YOU'RE GETTING THE 'ULTIMATE EDITION'. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS GREAT.
B000060P79|4.0|I joined Amazon just to say how sucky this piece of crap album is. A co-worker of mine listens to this at work and then he cries all day because he can't figure out why he likes it.
1612930832|5.0|i'v read many books and i think it is the best. Will recommend it to my friends and family. Love it.
0525478817|5.0|I could write all day about how marvelous I found this book, but I'll just let everyone else do that. I want to say that although a sad note is put on this book for the first few pages, this will make you feel all of the things. I know I felt them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just plain fun and very addicting! Good way to waste time! Makes you laugh and gets pretty challenging. Go ahead, get the game
B008Y6RYDS|2.0|Does give you a peak at 60s mentality. Also reminds you how people age (the actors are all extremely young looking - which of course they were at that time).
B0035S996U|5.0|The movie is very suspenseful and it keeps you hooked. One of my favorite movies of all time for sure.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Guy Clark is a first rate songwriter who is always a pleasure to hear. Buy this album and you won't be disappointed.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A playable game timed challenges sometimes difficult can be frustrating waiting for crystals but quite interesting with variety of challenges
B003DF4582|5.0|First Knight is one of our very favorite movies to watch and Knight's Tale is really a fun movie set in the days of yore.  Great twosome, but very diverse.
1481130331|5.0|I confess that I am not a fan of historical fiction, movies, or video games. But i decided that in order to read The Luck of the Weissensteiners,i had to cleanse my mind of such preconceived notions. I am glad that i did. The story was painted with a collage of gritty, war torn violence, prejudice, and heartbreak that makes a spin on the word \\"Luck\\" in the title. There isn't any but bad. The characters take on the scenery that surrounds them.  Love and betrayal, avarice and poverty, struggle and survival are themes found in as a part of these characters' makeup.<br />  Between the scenery of Bratislava with its multi-cultural roots and centuries of invasion and dominance by outsiders and the characters' depth, i found myself saddened with this story. I have only felt like that a few times. And even though i had an inclination of how the story would end, i still hoped that it would go otherwise. In this, i found and appreciated Mr. Fischer's pen. Great in depth but tragic read.
1476734941|4.0|A lot of info. in this book are things that I already knew. But I have been around this kind if info. for many years.<br />I would say that if this is something new to you then this would be a GREAT book to start with.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|This movie is boring, slow, sad and full of despair. I am shocked that \\"A\\" list actors would be part of such an empty movie. Rachel McAdams usually is very selective about the parts she takes....not so with this one.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Amazing!  I loved it.  I bought it because my Grand daughter was reading it and I wanted to read it with her.  What a shame mankind reduced itself to. It haunts me every day.  J.C.C.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not the best book of the series, I felt like there were still loose ends, and characters were brought in but didn't really do anything for the story. Hopefully the follow-up will be better.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Seems to be a great app. Works just as good if not better than on my Pc. Would recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The products was simple to setup and use. It has been working since day one with no issues, I just wish I had bought more than one to use my other TV's.<br /><br />For 35 dollars, you cannot go wrong here...Plus I was one of the lucky ones that also got the 3 month Netflix streaming service for free in this deal.
B000PHNHMQ|2.0|Gun looks great feels nice typical makita feel as I am a huge makita fan.  This nailer was a huge disappointment.  My dad uses only dewalt and porter cable guns for years without a problem but I decided to stick with makita as I really like everything I own.  First day I pull it out on paint grade base and shoe and had a lot of trouble sinking nails consistently even with the depth setting set to the deepest.  Next day working on an older home with original trim and maybe one of 5 nails would sink in the crown.  The gun lasted half a room and is back in the box being returned for the cheaper dewalt 18 gauge.  Now I see why my local store didn't stock this item but it &#34;could be ordered&#34;.  If you plan on shooting the larger nails this gun is supposed to accept I would think about a different gun.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|I loved it. Had a Traveling Wilbury feel sometimes.  Great CD, great music.  We seek out traveling music to play on vacation...this one tops the list this year.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great city strategy game to play on the kindle. PRETTY IN DEPTH and pretty good video presentation. Lots of fun for hours. Like the play while minimized feature. Overall four star game
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|Love this movie, love Audrey, love the soundtrack! Makes me feel good after watching it. A wonderful classic to enjoy many times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome!<br /> Love it. Love it LOVE it LOVE LOVE love it. It's the best thing ever. U need this game
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I really like this app but I wish you didn't have to upgrade just to get one song as an alarm. my overall rating is three stars.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|Obviously, if you don't like math, this isn't for you. Unfortunately, I didn't catch on to that before downloading and attempting to play it. It gave me a headache. It's not the developers fault. By all means, if you enjoy math and numbers, play this game.
B00275EGWY|3.0|It was all right, but I wonder why it won Best Picture.  Clearly, Avatar was a more groundbreaking and intricately made film.  This must be a reflection of the Academy's bias against colossal Box Office draws.  I wouldn't have seen it at all if it hadn't won Best Picture.  I'd give that to Avatar.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|*Easy setup<br />*Flawless streamingstreaming<br />*Price is crazy cheap<br />*If you own an Android device and have a Netflix account, this is a must-have device
B00BI73CVI|2.0|There were so many things wrong with this movie:<br /><br />-- The girl who played Cosette could not sing, period.<br /><br />-- Hugh Jackman overacted the entire movie, which was even more distracting because Russell Crowe *under*acted throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />-- Oddly enough, I actually liked Crowe's singing more than Jackman's; I thought he portrayed a unique, more masculine version of Javert that hadn't really been done before. Unfortunately, his rather stoic singing meant that it made zero sense when his character killed himself; who kills himself over a case he didn't really care about to begin with?<br /><br />-- Anne Hathaway was admittedly amazing.<br /><br />-- I thought Samantha Barks (as Eponine) was competent, but didn't possess the emotional capacity of her Broadway counterparts Lea Salonga & Frances Ruffelle. Also, cutting A Little Fall of Rain down that significantly + barely singing it (as much as they were whispering it) = NOT ok.<br /><br />-- The camera work was awful<br /><br />-- The film cut the scenes awkwardly<br /><br />There are strong points to the movie, but it definitely didn't live up to its potential.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this game is awesome. very easy to play and exciting ...addicting. great graphics, music and challenges .you'll. play it for hours
B006SV2LWA|5.0|I thought it was a frighteningly realistic depiction of what would happen should we ever encounter this kind of situation. It sort of reminds the audience that we are NOT at all prepared for a public health crisis like this, and that we are still so vulnerable despite all the advances we have made in science and medicine.
B00AXVHHTI|5.0|I simply adore this show!!  That is the enitre reason I became a subscriber to Amazon Prime!  This show has values, traditions, morals and no nudity, no language, no vulgarity. It is a joy to watch.  I find myself wishing we could return to a simplier time.  It is wonderfully written and acted.  The cast works so well together.  The wardrobe and set designs are beautiful.  If you are thinking about watching but aren't sure yet, just watch it and you will be hooked along with the rest of the UK and the USA!!  :)
B004HWT6DO|5.0|This was a very well-acted film. You both dislike and empathize with the Zuckerberg character. Also: it's an oddly realistic take on Harvard life.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|This is the first Dexter book. Allowing you to root for the &#34;bad guy&#34; with a decent agenda. He gets away with what some people would like to themselves. I think that's why these books are so popular (besides the show). I recommend it to those who enjoy the television show.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great I love getting up and playing the tournament every day.  I also just playing Hinton and the slots all together.
B0038OY6DW|5.0|Just Awesome, Robert Downey has proven to be a very versatile and excellent actor.  I look forward to his movies, now.
B00CJGP116|3.0|I think Marc Anthony has lost his touch quite a bit. I have been a fan since his first salsa album \\"Otra Nota\\" and this new album does not hold up to his previous releases. Some of these songs sound forced and rushed. He just doesn't flow like he used to.<br /><br />The music doesn't have that captivating feeling it once had. In previous albums, he sounded in control and confident in his voice. A legendary Salso icon should be able to do better than this.<br /><br />When I first heard it on the radio, I said to myself, after 9 years of not releasing a Salsa album, this is it?! And only 41 minutes long!
B007V9N5R8|5.0|Really pleased with how well this works and how easy it is to integrate the color checker into my workflow.<br /><br />Quality product with quality results
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I enjoyed the book for its historic value. To me it seemed to repetitious of a lot of the facts. All the citing and comparison of the Gospels became confusing after a while.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Recommended by a friend (he loves Sci-Fi) I got into it at first but quickly became disinterested --very choppy & all over the place.  Not my kind of reading.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|this is a great product,it would be even greater if it had more apps,<br />easy setup plug and play,connects with wireless network real fast,<br />i love it.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|it's a good game. not the biggest fan of the peanut concept because.. unless you wanna pay for more... it takes forever to get some of the quests done. but overall it's an enjoyable game
B00116FT6M|5.0|Years ago visiting a friend out-of-town on Christmas Eve, and he wanted to watch this.  I was against it, but he was pretty down-and-out this particular holiday, so I succumbed.  Just 20 minutes in, I was hooked!  I'm not much into play-type movies or musicals, but this is truly an enjoyable watch.  Very FUN and unique.  The cast is great, the music is playful, the setting nostalgic and the message is sends is quite powerful.  Most will enjoy this, if not just for for John Travolta in drag alone...
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|It is &#34;meaty,&#34; yet easy to read.  The examples are easy to read and clear.  The experiments are amazing.  Just do it!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|So the violence is a little over the top, but it's about what you'd expect. If you took any depth out of what Van Helsing had, it would be this movie. It will definitely be in the $5 bin soon, but its worth a watch.
B000IZBP56|1.0|If you have read the book Timeline by Michael Crichton, then think the movie would be interesting to see you'll be really disappointed. I wouldn't even rate it a &#34;B&#34; movie, it's crap!
B000RPCK1U|5.0|Is Pierce Brosnan the best 007 thus far? I don't think so...but that shouldn't stop anyone who is a fan of the franchise from enjoying these movies. A little more &#34;action packed&#34; than previous ones. They also continue the trend of PG-13 as opposed to the PG rating of majority of the early movies.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|I loved the writing.. I was hoping for a more original story line but it was wonderful enough to where I couldn't put it down
0345528581|5.0|This book goes GREAT with the APP available on most smart-phones, as it is based on this book. But it gives what a lot of folks need, structure, and freedom. There are 10-week plans for anyone that needs the structure, but also there is the freedom to change the exercise to anything you want from the category you're changing (push, pull, arms, etc). Very versatile and easy to use, each exercise is broken down on how to do it with comprehensive pictures.
B00785P2QC|4.0|However, it seems to need real money rather quickly, but the concept of the game is very addicting with the building and transporting and monitoring the repairs
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Not one of the official 'produced by Eon' movies, but if you were a fan of Sean Connery as James Bond, this is a must have. Its a bit of a different flavor than past movies, but no less enjoyable. As with most of these movies, (and most movies in general) its a love it or hate it movie.
B003R50F00|5.0|Kept me in the moment, I could feel every emotion and at times felt I was there in that basement. One of my new favourite books. A great insight to the tragedy of war and innocence of children.
0812983459|3.0|Loved the writing and the characters, but couldn't understand why he just didn't take a car.  The premise of the book left me puzzled
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This is a good shoot em up game. Kind of repetitive after a while.  Good for on the train or bus.<br /> You get what you pay for.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|Like the backgrounds, tiles and the numerous tile layouts. I would like the option to opt out of a clock and top scores.  It would also be awesome to finish a game you lose and play the same game again.  I like to challenge myself and just enjoy the experience.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, reply value is decent and it's not overly easy. Got it as the FAotD so well worth it. Check it out.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I was unsure how this movie was going to be, after watching it i'm kicking myself for not going to see it in the theater!!!! Great pllot, the twist was just as good, the fact it had Morgan Freeman in it was the best!! FYI, I remember watching him on The Electric Company!!! Still a great actor!!! Tom too!!!!
B0094LYBT2|5.0|This is a fabulous family show.  Our entire family loved it.  Clean, funny, serious, great morals, nothing bad at all.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|I thought it was a great movie, plot held  all the way to the end when it all comes full circle.. Great acting.. Whats not to like???
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Good game gggggggggggghhhhhhhhh true get thunderbird  th he.  Badgered. Blvd nd  Blvd bids BYE study gags can. She beg high
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Can enyone explain how this movie was made??? DO I need to start doing drugs to get this???? BOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I want my $$$ back!!!!!!
B00407PNY2|5.0|A great old movie and a great actor.  I do not remember hearing  foul language nor seeing stupid sex scenes.  Great old muscle cars at their best.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I use this every day.  It is great. Totally worth the  3.99 however got as a faotd.  Best free app of the day purchase yet!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Good book, well packaged, arrived on time.  My only complaint is that I couldn't put it down and thus my housework didn't get done!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This was an incredible performance, and I intend to watch it over and over again.  It was also interesting to see and hear performers from the past.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I was not familiar with Jo Nesbo but quickly found that Norwegian, my kinsman, Inspector Harry Hole was not only likable,  he was also respectful of partnering with Australian authorities.  The descriptive language of Jo Nesbo brought to life the landscape or cityscape of various parts of Australia. And finally I also felt that the character of Harry Hole was crafted with a kind of honesty that could include his failures as well as his strengths.  I now am interested in reading other books by Jo Nesbo as I enjoyed his lovely descriptive style.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another great boom that everybody should read! And im sure that the Mockingjay is also great! I cant wait for the movies.
B007MDB71O|4.0|This was like a blend between Superman, Star Wars and Conan the Barbarian. An interesting twist as Edgar Rice Burroughs writes himself into the story.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Funny, humane and witty---we've all known fellows like each of these....all their foolishness and vanities come through, but none of it is mean-spirited
030758836X|4.0|Well written.  I read it through in a couple of days because I was so intriqued by it.  Near the end of the 2nd part I began to suspect what was going on so had to read on to verify my suspections.  Fun read.
B00005JA8B|5.0|Nothing else comes close to the excitement of this series, in my humble opinion. Sure, some in the series are better than others, but essentially you'd have to be brain dead not to be lit up by Predator! But then, I never did grow up. Yeah!
0525952926|3.0|Because I read the 1st book and know there will be a third and final I feel compelled to read this one to keep up. My main negative is that there are so many characters that I have to go back at times to re-interduce myself to who I'm now reading about.
6304698798|5.0|This film really stands the test of time. What a story covering what history, what Leone direction and for it's time, what acting too and what a fantastic Morricone score. Seeing this movie, many times over, should be at the top of everyone's bucket list.
B0098VXN2Y|1.0|The kids insisted we watch it. I really wish I had that hour and a half of my life back.
B0065FIHYA|1.0|Glitched like crazy and I never got to watch it. Still paid for it. I guess the problem was my HDMI cable that connects my Kindl to the TV. Pretty crappy since it's an Amazon cable.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Yes, the opening episode was just superb. The second one was filled with Asian sterotypes and overacting. Good luck with the rest of them. I probably shall not be watching.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Does have good functionality at all. I'm pretty upset that I can't have the views that I would prefer. It's honestly better on every other device than the Kindle. Just gross.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|A beautiful weather app yes but not convincing. I downloaded weather channel app and this one and found myself falling in love with weather channel app because it has weather forecast hour by hour for up to like 7 days!! (And best of all, it's free!!).  For those that want details on future weather, I don't suggest this app. I think $1.99 is too much for this app, it should cost 99&cent;.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I leave it plugged into my computer and it charges what it is supposed to charge. That is pretty much it.
0788859544|3.0|It looked good on the outside it said it was new but on the inside the discs were scratched so no not new.But it still worked.
1402789599|5.0|I always promised myself I would read Origin of Species, but hadn't found the time.  I have read books by David Quammen and found him to be a very clear writer. This is a wonderful book, full of colorful pictures highlighting the book by Charles Darwin.  Quammen has not altered the text, simply added illustrations and notes. I am still reading, but it surprises me how clear Darwin's writing is. So many books from the 1800s contain long, complicated syntax, but not Darwin.  It's almost like chatting with him.<br />Read it.  Learn the truth for yourself.
0743243153|4.0|Loved everything about it up until the end...a little too much god and Jesus stuff,<br />I would have been less bored at the.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|love, love, love this movie...so cute and I love all the different monsters it. how can anyone not watch these kinds of movies???they r so good and fun to watch and i'm over 50!!!
1401938906|5.0|Great exercises and they work.<br />Writes about subject matter that I am familiar with and I learned a few things as well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|my husband downloaded this to the kindle and its something that he uses daily and loves it cuz it is also accurate
B00CJGP116|5.0|Love it. Marc Anthony is one of my very favorite singers, I am very glad to have purchased this cd from Amazon at a reasonable price.
B004UID2LC|5.0|use this on the kindle and it works gr8 so far. love the kindle too so it was worth  it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is really a great story - our entire family is enjoying the character and plot development.  It is also very interesting to see the British historical perspective of the 1912-1922 period (we are viewing the UK version).  We are really looking forward to the next season.  Cliff hanging season finale!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|You can't go wrong with this $35.00 dongle! A MUST have ! Netflix streaming is GREAT! I think it is a wonderful investment. I own a roku 2 XDS and Apple TV - the best part of the dongle is working on other items while watching content
B005FDXT32|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over and over. It's a Top 10 Classic and will likely endure for decades.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Awesome on all counts.  Tedischi hitting all the notes...beyond great.  Inspiring.  Trucks...outstanding.  Band tight and what this album would be like life...catch them!
B00D8H3Q2G|1.0|I have the original CD from 1994, the sound quality is VERY good.<br />Bought the new SACD, I have a Marantz SACD player.<br />Sound quality on original CD is far superior to SACD reissue.<br />Original CD has more detail, better dynamics and separation.<br />BTW, I have disc number 0564 of the SACD.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Flynn takes you into the confidence of each character before revealing the flaws and how that character has fooled you so that the book sets up so many layers of intrigue.  On the surface there's a missing wife. Beneath is manipulation, disguise, obsessive parenting, the illusion of perfection and a haunting feeling the the people closest to you may not be what they seem. Structurally superb.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|When I leave a theater and I am in tears, it means that the film has touched my soul.  I have been to Auschwitz, the Warsaw Ghetto Memorial, and other points of interest in Europe involved in WWII (including Omaha Beach).  I have taken my children so they will know that revisionist historians can not change history and they can attest to the fact that they have been to these places.  I think that Spielberg is one of the greatest film makers of all time because of the emotional connection he can make with the audience. He makes us feel. He makes us feel our humanity.  I am not Jewish.  But I felt the plight of the doomed Jews of Europe.  I am not black, but I felt the desperation of Miss Celie in the Color Purple. I have never been in war, but I felt the anguish of James Ryan as he stood at the foot of Capt. Miller's grave.<br />Oskar Schindler was a flawed human being, but he was a human and although initially it was for business reasons, eventually he was able to save his employees because what was being done to them was wrong, universally, spiritually, on on a human scale.  He never amounted to much, but if there is a heaven, he is certainly there (or at least Purgatory).
B00785P2QC|3.0|Takes too long to get all needed supplies to build things and energy refresh is alright.  Can't reorient items to fit space available.  Good to do while watching Tv.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Fast pace with good character development .Believable and interesting to the end. As with all Harry Bosch novels one can feel the grittness of the JOB.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Compromising product compared to Apple TV or Roku.<br /><br />Only youtube and netflix is able to do real casting rest all you need to share your complete browser which is very slow and vedio and audio lags.<br />Amazon vedio does not work, no audio or vedio...
B00755MHXG|5.0|My 11-year-old son told me to read it and I got down to reading it straightaway. It was awesome, especially because we could share a lot of the story, which I highly recommend to middle school kids and their parents. Well-done!
0071422943|5.0|Didn't even get it catalogued for my library before I had great feedback!<br />Well worth the money.<br />Great addition for engineering collections.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|I loved it!!! It has feed my curiosity.....after becoming addicted to ancient aliens. I will continue to read the books of Erich von Daniels. He is definitely on to something.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My 3 year old daughter kept asking me to rent this, so I gave in (as usual). She saw part 2 at the movie recently but I didn't know what it was about. Great movie! Great message.
B003E20ZQA|5.0|Amazing book!<br />Beautiful story and amazing characters, worth reading and enjoying the spirit of the 70' in New York, !
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Please buy one of these if you have a flat screen display with HDMI and not net capabilities. it will be well worth you money and time.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|Very intellectual point of views. will make you think of what you could be doing to save more money and provides tip on what to do to become &#34;the Millionaire Next Door&#34; instead of living beside him.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I totally loved this movie. The animation was excellent, as was the story and the action. I loved Jane Lynch's Final Fantasy-esque character. Loved the 80's arcade characters. LOVED the bad guy affirmation: \\"I am bad. And that's good.\\"
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Blah it doesn't work at all. The quality stinks and I can't get it to work. At all high man
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love to dress up and put make up on so this game is cool and I love it so so much!!!!!!!
B00D8JE0H4|5.0|First, there is some language which I don't normally allow a child (or myself) to be around, but this movie shows the language dropping away as the main character changes her life, so I let my kids watch this one. Its a sort of sappy story line..., Whoopi plays a woman who had decided at a very young age to live the life of a singer and mistress in a fancy casino. After witnessing a murder she is put into protective custody... and her life with the nuns changes her... and she, in turn, changes the nuns... Okay, its all sappy.<br />But Whoopi Goldberg, Maggie Smith... WOW... and the support characters... Mary Wickes, Harvey Keitel, Joseph Maher, many more, its like the all-star cast of support players... they really do it well. Its fun, exciting, and not morally depraved, so we like it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I personally enjoy WWII history so this app is great. The guns have super realistic features and its definitely worth the dollar.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's a well designed and clever piece of technology.  .  Until a lot more apps and site support Chromecast, it will be of limited us.<br />The setup is easy for wireless applications but it's not obvious how to get a wired device on your network to join in the fun.<br />Only by Googling a solution did I discover how to get Chrome to play an MP4.  It can't play AVI's so I cant 'chrome cast' them.<br />The device itself gets very hot while powered up, so I power it off a USB outlet on my TV.  That way it is powered off when my TV is, rather than constantly cooking while being powered by mains electric.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This unit arrived ready to go and did a good job of converting hundreds of slides to files on my computer.  It is easy to use and fast.  The display assures the slide is properly positioned and makes it easy to decide if the picture is worth saving.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Makes me feel like a kid again.Not the best graphics, but fun.  Will probably get old fast, but for free what do you have to lose.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|The reviews I read about the case being not so hot are spot on, however the DVDS are awesome, I can honestly say I've watched each one and they all work fine.
B00DZP3KJ0|4.0|Since I know LR4 the book is not breaking for me but it tells you about new features, best practises and features of LR that I did not used in decent and detailed way. The way Scott Kelby always does :-)
B001C4AFOY|5.0|What a lovely story and I'm so glad someone made a movie about the beginning of her life as queen.  The acting was wonderful and the story was so interesting.  I would have liked to know more about a few of the other characters that shaped her beginning years.
B0085CXVOC|5.0|I love that while there is high adventure and romance, there is no worries about the female showing too much. Because of that I could sit back and enjoy  this great action comedy. The concept, acting and charcter interactions was so fun to watch. A rare jewel in modern movie making.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a great game. It is very very additive ! I would highly recommend it. The slots i'm this game are fun also.
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|This CPU is about $40 cheaper than the K version. I won't be overclocking it's plenty fast just like it is. WoW what a speed increase from my Core 2 duo 2.4. Battlefield 3 runs faster now, same Video card (GTX560) but also 8 gb memory now vs 4 before. Yea it's worth it. Now I can put that $40 on a new Video card to get ready for Battlefield 4.
B0017WCERM|3.0|This LP is great but my pressing skips alot, I must have gotten a bad pressing but it definitely isn't what I expected.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fun game...keeps you interested til the end.<br />Somethings are hard to find due to the fact you cannot see them.

B0042FZOFU|5.0|i love toy story in and out, the story is good the characters dynamic, and because they're all toys I gives me a since of nostalgia.<br />the blu ray conversion is beautiful, all three movies are well represented from the audio, color saturation, and clarity, in short if you like toy story you owe it to yourself to own this timeless piece.<br />thumbs up Pixar you won me over!

B0059WTMLW|4.0|I love to play this game.  it is mind challenging and has varied settings to increase the challenge.  Very addictive.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|1. I don't watch &#34;fiction&#34; TV<br />2. Have read and heard about this show but didn't even realize that we get it (I'm still pretty much ABC, CBS, NBC, HGTV, DIY, etc.)<br />3. Watched in my Kindle Fire -- and I was surprised how crisp the video was<br />4. Is a refreshing break from the 'mysteries' my spouse tends to watch (Criminal Minds, Cold Case, etc.)<br />5. If you haven't seen it, try it. I'll watch a few more -- but I think I might be on to something here.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I will let the other reviewers speak to the show itself, but I wanted to make a point about the quality of the Blu-Ray release.  I watched the other seasons of this show on Netflix and had a certain expectation for the video and audio quality when I got this Blu-Ray.  I was blown away when the opening credits of the first episode rolled.  Every scene was incredibly sharp and had a range and depth of color that makes the show I watched on Netflix look like VHS.  The audio was also much improved, though I expected as much since Netflix doesn't have an advanced multi-channel audio setup.
1439153663|4.0|I found this book a bit too drawn out and at first the characters were confusing. The story was good and the subject matter never ceases to amaze me.  I can not imagine living my life during this time period.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|The b sides and extras on these extended eps give a deep insight into the creative processes involved in putting together the Mellon Collie albums.
1401937519|5.0|I found Anita's story not only medically amazing ( hurrah!) but very personally transformative!  How much do any of us really know of our magnificence?!  I am telling everyone about Anita's beautifully shared story!  Please do yourself this sweetness...read this story....or even better listen to Anita read it to you!! I have done both (and will continue to).  I wish you Joy! Namaste
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut has an unbelievable imagination, certainly sounding like PTSD.  He is not afraid of offending, repulsing or scaring his readers!
B00785P2QC|4.0|since the game blackmailed me into writing this review for points....I'm writing a review...the game is fun and addictive.. great for the whole family
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works and it works great best 35 dollars I ever spent only regret I did't purchase more than one now I have to wait.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Overall am thrilled and amazed with this product. As a google product, one would expect this to work flawlessly with other google products. But answer is no, casting chrome browser gets disconnected intermittently. Not all youtube videos are casted to chromecast, some videos get unexpected error but works when you cast the full chrome tab to TV.<br />May be some updates in future to youtube and chrmocast would make this as wonderful tool.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|My daughter raved about this book so I bought it.......I was not as impressed as she was, but it is a nice edition to my  growing book collection.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Cute game, nothing too difficult. Has a lot of the same games over and over, ex. mini games are mostly y puzzles. Dialog gets monotonous, but you can skip over that. No ads, decent graphics. Recommended to fill some free time, but not challenge the mind.
B004BLDD9Y|2.0|I ordered two light bulbs. One was totally shattered with the protective plastic case completely open and the shipping box filled with chards. The surviving light is work as advertised. Based on a 50%survival rate these lights are far too expensive.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Possibly not the best book to read after recently losing a loved one...however, it does give you the opportunity to let out the emotions you have been holding in since it happened as you try to participate in normal society. This book is so full of emotion, and yes, it demands to be felt.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Good book, can't wait for the next installment!  When does it come out?<br />Good characters; didn't mind length! Recommend this book for everyone!!
1476733953|4.0|As good as the hype.  The initial short story (part 1 of the omnibus) that started it all was just so chilling, I immediately read the entire omnibus and the rest of the series (Shift, Dust) within five days.  The reader was really sucked into the dimensions, the sense of claustrophobia in the books ... throughout the trilogy I kept feeling how, on some scale, the people in the silo were like ants, and how crazy that must feel.  I took one star off because for some reason I wasn't too fond of the lead character, Juliette.  The tough-girl act (preaching, constantly threatening others with all the whoop-ass she's going to unleash on them etc etc) became somewhat cliche and annoying.<br /><br />Also, how refreshing is it that an independently-published author actually produces a best-seller that isn't terrible fan-fic quality? I was really wary about this at first because a lot of other things that were underground hits and only later picked up by publishers were things like Fifty Shades.  When I read the first story and it was actually GOOD and well-written, I was surprised and truly impressed by the quality.
B007HNFREW|2.0|Purchased the first episode without any specific information about the series other than the buzz I have heard about it from other shows. Looked like a genre I would be interested in.<br /><br />Very good story line... but be warned... lots of nudity and incest. Im sure this would not bother some, but I wish i would have read a review warning of this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it for kindle so it is different than shown on the app it says new realms is a in-game purchase I need help finding the IN app purchase PLZ help I'm 11 so I don't know alot of technology PLZ help
030758836X|4.0|The book starts off slow.  When the mystery begins you don't understand how this man can be suspected of murder yet all the clues say so.  It is told from the killer and victim's point of views.  It was a page turner however the ending kinda clunked and I had to read the ending a few times to make sure I understood what had happened.
B006YC74E8|5.0|i can do so many things with this app and can share what ive done on fbook and other places
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Gary Taubes has thoroughly researched and convincingly explained why low carb diets work and why low carb eating is healthy.  Additionally, he does it with a concise and easily understood writing style.  Great book!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|only a few videos show up, never uploads any more. have to retype what u are looking for after each video u look at
1451695195|5.0|Highly credible from a professional brain surgeon who was a typical skeptic prior to his near-death experience. A more detailed and beautiful description of the experience than any I've read before. I had pretty much given up on the idea of entities on the other side, but have to now seriously reconsider that decision after reading this book.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|You have to give some serious credit to Gameloft for the amazing graphics in this game! The online mode is also superior to other games and it runs smoothly and rarely has problems or a disconnection. The campaign isn't the greatest, however...more on that later. The online features are the main part of the game, in my opinion. There are many weapons from which to choose, a friends system to see who has the most skills, and social aspects that provide a better experience. It is really addicting and fun, and I highly recommend this title if you are looking for action and the best first-person shooter on mobile.<br /><br />Online and Local Wi-Fi Mode<br />Here is a reminder: local Wi-Fi is not bluetooth, but rather people on the same connection as you. I wish it was bluetooth, so you could just play with people near you, but the Gameloft LIVE! mode is really the part that you want to play. It is live gameplay with anyone playing in the world. As I've said, it is really smooth and I really didn't see any lagging or disconnection problems, at least on my connection. In the store, it isn't really a store to pay real money to buy anything, so don't worry. You can get credits through playing in ranked online matches and quite a bit quickly, actually, which you can use to &#34;buy&#34; weapons and signatures. By the way signatures are really cool. They have many kill signatures for what it says on your opponents' screen when you kill them. They now also have sounds that play when you kill an opponent, such as a cat's meow or a cocky &#34;Yeah!&#34; sound. There are backgrounds for your kill signature, too. Weapons are great and they have many guns to buy or get with credits. I like that you can up your game and actually add perks and military support that make it more as the console shooters. You can improve your abilities with this and get more kills. There are also leaderboards so you see how you stack up against others. There are social features that work well, such as forums. These will open a browser within the game. Another great thing about this game is that it is Game Circle-enabled on Kindle Fire, so you get another achievements system from Amazon and Amazon's own leaderboards for the game. Overall, online mode is the biggest reason I got this and they really delivered a thorough experience. I would like this to come to Ouya, the Android-powered gaming console, to see how much better it can be.<br /><br />Graphics<br />This is one of the best games, so it obviously needs stunning visuals. On the downside, it takes a lot of space on your device. It is huge. Seriously, it takes up over 1,100 MBs! This may take a while, but is worth it for the graphics. You can see some great ragdoll effects for killing soldiers. The story mode looks beautiful and deadly with the amazing graphics. I thank Gameloft for the hard work on the HD display. By the way, this is something that you have to see on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Story Mode 7/10<br />I haven't played through the whole story yet because I usually play online, but from what I have seen, it is an okay experience. One good thing is the fact that you play from both perspectives of good and bad characters, so that is cool. Ed Page says some pretty crazy things in the game, though. I know my review of this mode isn't that detailed, but if you get this game online play is the best.<br /><br />With a $7 price tag, you get one of the richest mobile experiences ever. This looks really, really nice on 7&#34; tablets such as the Kindle Fire HD. You get the story, online, and social features. The online play feels great and is addicting. This game is so cool because it uses the full power of your device and gives you such an immersive experience.

B004Z7AHZC|1.0|The recording quality on this dvd is terrible, white dots all over the screen and you can barely see the movie and the sound quality sucks. It is a cheap dubbing quality not worth a dime. Save your money and don't buy from this company. Extremely disappointed. I don't have time to bother sending it back or the expense. Lesson learned.
B003Y74KAW|4.0|The packaging of the cover is simple but good for it to get to wherever you are shipping it even internationally. The rubber material is good on the case and isn't too loose or too tight on the phone. All buttons are easily accessible but the Red color isn't as bright as the one in the picture which is why i gave it 4 Stars. Overall great cover quality for the price. I also purchased the white one which is also amazing but waiting to see if the color on that one changes like many white covers. If it doesn't ill update it to 5 Stars and keep you updated!
B00B3N4CWK|5.0|I had heard about this movie long time ago, but never had the chance to watch it. Finally I found it under amazon prime instant videos. It's a wonderful movie. So touching. I love it.
0071766588|5.0|I am currently using this book to study for the TOEFL Exam and it is amazing. It has great techniques to save time & score higher as well as alot of previous authentic exam questions. The CD actually works fine and all exams are there but it needs to be installed. Although many people said not all of the exams worked for them, they worked just fine for me. Highly recommended book if you want to score higher than 90 on the TOEFL. Will update with my score as soon as i get it.<br /><br />Finally got my TOEFL Scores & Highly recommend this. I got a total of 109 from 120 with the least of reading at 24/30. Highly advised to study from this book but if you want a score of 26 or higher in reading you need to have a high knowledge of alot of vocabulary as many of the toefl exams include hard vocabulary.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this product from Google. And it will only get better with time as more apps are developed for it.
0425263924|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It has alot of steamy romance scene's that will make your toes curl! Lol I can't wait for the next one.

B003YUC2FE|5.0|OMG i love the andys toy box it comes it. It was the cutest thing ever when i opening it
B008602KQI|3.0|I loved the book. I was underwhelmed by the movie. Poor storyline. Lacked depth of the characters. Just a plain action movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Nice device that just works. Getting 3 months of Netflix made it a no brainer. I'm looking forward to other companies coming on board and adding more value.  I have mine connected to a HDMI port on my receiver.  I don't understand Google saying that your best speakers are on your TV.  Really ?? I don't think I've heard any TV speaker that sound that good, get the audio into your home theater setup where it belongs.

B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I found the plot a bit strained.  There was no surprise at what was going on.  The characters were flat.  The ending wasn't credible.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was great novel that had lots of action and adventure at every corner. This book will hook even people that hate reading
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy playing this game. I spend way too much time doing this. It is addictive and very fun. Worth getting.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was very impressed by this book. It is both funny and serious, and it took me into a world I hadn't thought much about. It remained consistent riveting to the end, never striking a false note.
0307352153|4.0|You know that feeling when someone `gets' you?  Well that's how it is for an introvert to read this book.  I couldn't stop nodding `yes' as I turned the pages.  It's not that there hasn't been anything written about introverts before but perhaps not so comprehensively looking at how introverts react in almost every situation.  I especially related to Susan's foray into the Anthony Robbins workshop.<br />It certainly is a national stereotype that Americans are particularly extrovert.  Since a great deal of our psychological and management literature comes from American research one can see in the light of this work that many of the explanations and practices advocated are extrovert in their orientation.  This book beautifully fills in some of the gaps and provides ideas to approach common management issues in a different way.<br />There may be a tendency to go too far in the other direction in this work but it is easy to sift that out.  I will find this a valuable resource both in coaching and consulting to enrich interventions and make them more meaningful to a wider variety of people.
068484267X|2.0|There were moments of holding my sides laughing at the way the author wrote about his childhood...the school masters and<br />other childhood memories of various other adult characters and childhood friends, and his childish observations and thoughts.<br /><br />There were sad and touching moments.  For example, the author was given much more responsibility than his maturity level<br />allowed in caring for younger siblings, but he did so willingly. He had a genuine love for his family in spite of all the<br />dysfunction.  He held on to what little guidance and fun times his father gave him.  The reader can only imagine<br />how the author could have been helped if there were responsible adults around him to help him process the deep grief<br />of losing siblings, and of not being properly cared for physically or emotionally or spiritually.<br /><br />I kept hoping that at the end he would rise above the nihilism and shallow faith with which he was raised.<br />That didn't happen.  In fact, the author leaves the reader with the feeling that there really is no purpose to life.<br />It was, therefore, very disappointing to see him leave us with not much more wisdom or moral character than his father<br />had.  Still, it is a memoir and not a novel.  Maybe things changed for him as he matured.  He was only 19 at the end<br />of the book.<br /><br />This book has been placed on high school reading lists, and unless it is read with some guidance from a responsible adult,<br />I don't see how it could be useful to young people who are forming opinions about life and about themselves.<br /><br />I tried finding some qualifications for Pulitzer prizes (this book won the prize for biography in 1997), but they were<br />vague.  It seems that a book just needs to be nominated and enough of the committee has to agree.  I didn't find any<br />qualifying standards for being helpful or uplifting.<br /><br />The book does give a realistic view of incredible poverty.  (Imagine putting sugar in water when there is no milk for<br />a baby!)  It also lends some insight into Ireland's not-too-distant social history. I do think that the author has a<br />gift for writing and storytelling, and he certainly has a very down to earth lively sense of humor.<br /><br />Sadly, though, if you long to be left with a feeling of nihilistic hopelessness, this is a sure bet.<br /><br />My main concern is that it not be recommended for young people without guidance.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really good game. Keeps you coming back for more and the bonus is its free not constantly asking for purchases.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I have to agree there is too much chatter between challenges. Why not shorten the narrative to just enough to set up the next event. I took a clue from other reviews and just kept poking the screen till the next challenge began. Boy, is my finger sore.  Just not needed.  But the actual game is okay.  Make it easier to enjoy it.
B008NA2HMI|5.0|He did horrible things and led an extreme life but this was a great read! I like Jordan despite everything. Great writing style and u must keep reading to find out what happens to him. I do recommend this one!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good story line and character development. Every episode keeps you coming back for more to see how things will develop.
B000Q6GUWU|1.0|I tried playing this in several devices and was unsuccessful. I got one error stating &#34;wrong disk&#34;. Another error stating &#34;disk not formatted&#34;. The product did ship quickly & apperaed to be new.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Like other ratings it is a good game.  It is fun and you can spend a lot of time playing.  However if you want to move ahead in the game you need to spend money to get better gear, which helps you complete areas.  This is unfortunate.
B0081336FO|5.0|If you have not tried this version from BBC, I highly recommend it.  Set in the modern day...entire cast is amazing. Each episode is essentially a movie and they are very well written and produced.  Easily my favorite portrayal of Sherlock so far...
B009GXHOW4|4.0|it is a very good app sbd when I got my iphone I wanted to download it but its wasn't there wish it was for all devices.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|So far, so good, but I have heard users who lose all their ebooks once they're done, or if they don't continue reading them for a couple days. I'll have to add more info, if the system will let me, to tell people if I lost the book or not.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|I like dance movies and happy endings.  This movie had a good story.  The ugly duckling turns out to be a swan.  dancing was great.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I have studied a lot of material about Jesus and this is the first time that I have read anything that put His ministry in historical context. It was very helpful.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I am very happy with the Marware case for my Kindle. I love that it turns the Kindle off when it closes and that it has the elastic band to keep it closed. It stands well when I want to use it to watch something and doesn't add much weight to the product for throwing it into a bag to commute with.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Great characters and twists and turns to keep you guessing the outcome. Enough historical details to make the fictions believable without getting bogged down.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I really enjoy the variety of information Mail provides- I have not been able to access it the past few days.Screen reads &#34;Mail Has stopped&#34; Any suggestions?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! My two year old loves it too. The graphics are great. Lots of action and great for developing motor skills. Must have for minion fans.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book excited to read the third!!! Like downloading books to my Kindle. Was better than the first book.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've been reading Altucher's Quora posts for a few months now, and thought that this book would be an equally enlightening read.  His writing style sticks with you, it's easy to read, somewhat conversational, but never rambling.  You feel like he's talking right to you, with a lot of common sense (and some insightful) advice that you wish your uncles or grandparents would have given you in your early 20s.  It helped to change my outlook on a few things in my life, and there are a few bits of advice that I've already started following in my life.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Liked this book a lot,was surprised it was so good considering it was FREE.Will defiantly try other free books again
0062082353|5.0|I read all of these type books and this one is a good exciting read. I actually read the entire book on a weekend as it was really engaging. Knowing that this guy is now dead and died in the US by another marine is sickening. The wars would be short if we had more guys like this great sniper.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Liked this book a lot, easy reading had trouble to put it down. Wish there was a fourth book !!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Lots of fun! My son and I played it and really enjoy it. Not sure about the security issues though. That concerns me.
0762434279|1.0|book is too small, Im really not pleased @ all with this item. I was soooo excited when packaged arrived until I opened the box. Really don't know if i should order any other books from amazon
B009KS4XRO|5.0|FUN TO PLAY THE FREE BINGO TOURNAMENT EVERY DAY AND ALWAYS AVAILABLE DIFFERENT BINGO ROOMS WERE YOU CAN PLAY DIFFERENT LEVELS. YOU CAN ALSO PLAY SLOTS.THIS IS THE BEST BINGO GAME I'VE FOUND, YOU CAN Try IT FREE THROUGH AMAZON.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The trilogy was okay. I had to skim through some of the bedroom scenes. It seemed too ....much.  I really would have enjoyed a better storyline and less bedroom/playroom scenes.Will be curious to see how the big screen adaption gets the storyline while toning down all the bedroom scenes.
B002Y3I2B0|5.0|This movie won't be for everyone, but if you are a fan of Javier Bardem or Penelope Cruz, this is absolutely worth a watch. They have amazing chemistry in this film, making it super comical and romantic all at the same time. Scarlett Johansen never earned my respect until I saw this film; now I am a huge fan.
1616550414|5.0|Bought this for my 11 year old son. He LOVES it! The complete reference guide to every Zelda game, comic and cartoon ever made. It's large though. More like a coffee table book.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I've been using this 3D mouse for about 4 years now.  All I can say is that it is probably the most useful computer accessory I've purchased.  This 3D mouse allows you to manipulate your CAD model using essentially a joystick rather than clicking and scrolling with a traditional mouse.  Any orientation can be achieved by using the rotation, spin, zoom, etc which is offered by the 3D mouse.  There are also two buttons which can be programmed for your particular application.  I use SolidWorks and have programmed the left button to bring up my shortcut menu *when in sketch mode same as pressing s) and the right button to fit the model to screen (same as pressing f).  The 3D mouse also works in other applications but my feeling is that the best gains are had when using with a CAD program.  I've considered the more expensive products from 3D connexion but am so satisfied with this one, and would most likely not use all the customizable features of the higher end versions, that I don't think I will ever replace it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|All along, I thought I was figuring things out; the usual characters, plot, distractions. Amazing, how folks work things out and how imperfections really are survivable.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Michael Connelly succeeds in keeping the suspense until the very end. I have learned that to speculate about &#34;who did it&#34; is a waste of precious  time...now I just sit back and devour every well written page.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Really good, and well put together.  Graphics are well drawn, kept me occupied for hours so I would say for all ages
B00336C3EY|5.0|Saw this originally in the theater, but was glad to find it on streaming video - this is the kind of film that needs to be seen, not just viewed.  What I mean by that is that the Coen brothers are quite adept with the use of symbolism and allegory, and it shows throughout this film - starting from the opening sequence (featuring Fyvush Finkel, one of, if not the last, veterans of the Yiddish stage) and continuing throughout the entire film. Great performance from Michael Stuhlbarg as the title character, a professor in 1960's suburban Minnesota who is searching for meaning and clarity after a series of events in his life turn him into a latter-day Job.  Good cameo from Simon Helberg (Big Bang Theory) as a young rabbi.
B008EKMB82|5.0|My first read of a novel by this author. The book was engaging and, while at times a difficult read, I was truly invested in what happens to all of the characters.  It did get a little too 'cerebral' for me at the end but I still loved it and would like to read it again someday.  I will look for more by this author.
B005V5WBFG|4.0|It is okay.  It does keep you informed if there is a threat of anything you have downloaded.  It is a good security.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I would give this a five for headphones but the wires will eventually break.<br /><br />they are extremely lightweight and you can listen to other noises at the same time.<br /><br />they have inflated the price though. Outragious. Sony no longer makes
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Fun but mostly I'm doing it for free in game credits though I did get it for free so maybe its not worth it, their other game grow is really resource intensive thp
0783225482|5.0|I really like this movie, so do my ex girlfriends, this is the third time i have bought it because it always walks away. very fast ship
B006UKFFE0|4.0|This was a really good work book.  Each section had actionable information and charts that helped me to understand the concepts.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is interesting and hard to put down.  I loved the history, but the characters solute my heart.  A greats
B00005KAQP|5.0|This dvd was wonderful I laughed so much loved the music and I rate it very high 5 stars for sure.I had seen it years ago and remembered why I loved it so much the minute I played it. Whoopi was amazing in it.No wonder it was such a big hit being from a Catholic background the Nuns really were so realistic and fun brought me back to those glory days of school and all the pranks we did. Hope anyone who watches it will find it charming as I did.
0321344758|2.0|I should have realized that a book published in 2005 has very little application to today's usability requirements. The concepts are similar, but it the examples are beyond antiquated for new applications under development.
B001AFF25W|5.0|Fantastic book for anyone looking to increase their productivity and or income. A must read for self employed individuals. Will read again!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoy the challenge of each level. Determining the clues &amp; how each on works together is the best. Graphics are a bit simple but work well.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|It's a lens cap, it fits properly and is as described.  Not much else can be said about this.  Very happy with the product.
B003XMWSSY|5.0|This is an excellent resource for serious writers. I have since heard his points in many writers' conferences and other professional functions.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Whatever you did with this last update completely messed up th game. Error message and then closes out on my daughter, very upsetting.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Almost everyone in our family loves this game.  We take at least one copy on all family get-togethers.  Everyone from the 8 year old to the grandparents can play.  The games are fast paced...usually ending within 45 minute or so, which is nice so playing partners can rotate in and out.  Agreeing to play doesnt mean you have to commit to a 4 hour plus time frame.  This is absolutly a great game for college students to have in the dorm.
1616550414|5.0|To THE LEGEND OF ZELDA's history that is! :P<br />I’ve read the whole entire book EVERYTHING! And I must say this book is great for any Zelda fan (mostly from reading age and up of course. :) ) However!... as I said, while reading thru this book, there were some “errors” (possibly made by the Dark horse comics) and you’re a huge Z-fan you’ve prolly spotted them yourself, right? Buuuut...it’s nothing major! I would still say this is a great book and totally worth the money.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Everything you could ask for, epic adventure, love, loss, mans inhumanity to man and happily ever after. + Hugh Jackman
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved it.  Recommend it to others.  Nicely written with good story line.  Ending sort of obvious though.  Still a good read.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|Alright I have the taste of a 10 year old boy! I loved this movie but I like Ron Pearlman and have since he did Beauty and the Beast on TV
B002WJI63A|4.0|So my princess peach looks much like this one, I just think when she was made her hair around her face was sewn a little too close to her eyes giving her this mutton chop look. Other than that shes awesome, super soft!
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Just as funny as the first one, and with improved Irish accents all around! See it for Norman Reedus, if nothing else.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game..as relaxing as it is frustrating. I play a game until I win and sometimes I win right away.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|easy peasy set-up. Easy to use. would recommend it in a New York minute. Glad I made this purchase. Thanks
1439153663|4.0|Kind of depressing, but very hard to put down! I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it. Just don't expect happiness in this book!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you are a big Google person like me, buy this product!  Easy to set up, easier to use.  I love watching YouTube subscriptions on my flat screen, and watching movies is supper easy. I've been waiting for Google to produce something like this for so long.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|App successfully downloaded and worked on Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Kindle Fire HD, and Samsung Galaxy S4. I created a test diary and wrote a few notes. Of course, the easiest place to do this was on the Galaxy Note with the S Pen, but using my finger on the Fire and S4 worked well and all words were legible. I linked each devices (in the Settings menu) to Dropbox and as I open the next device, what I had written earlier on the different devices was automatically updated and added to my test diary. So far, it works perfectly and syncs immediately.<br />I do wonder why there are two apps from the same company with exactly the same name. I couldn't find any difference between them and they both said that they were compatible with all of my devices. I find this very strange and their website is lacking at best.<br />All in all, this app has a huge potential and some great features. I love the syncing.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|After all the media publicity about this NYT best seller, I decided to read it.  As a Christian I really wanted to know what this guy had to say about Jesus.  Before purchasing the book I knew of Aslan's claim to have once been a Christian, and that he now considers himself Muslim.  With that background and with all of his academia religious credentials, I wanted to hear his perspective about Jesus.  I didn't expect to agree with him, but I thought it would be good to know his arguments.  The author sounds very angry to me.  He also doesn't know as much about The Holy Bible as he thinks he does.  He writes his opinions as facts and makes numerous errant claims about what the Bible actually says.  People who don't know what Scripture actually says are at risk of believing this book's story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is such a great devise. It doesn't have a lot to it (at the moment), but the potential for what this will be able to do in the future is going to be great. I already love it for Netflix and YouTube (so much easier to use than on my PS3 for YouTube).<br /><br />One thing I didn't understand was powering the unit.  It needs a USB plugged into it at all times to power it.  Now, if you have a larger / newer HDTV, there will be a USB port in it (like my 42&#34; Samsung). BUT, this really isn't that big of a deal. At all.<br /><br />Seriously, if you're even THINKING about buying this, do. It's some of the best money I've ever spent, and it's barely anything at all.<br /><br />Do it. You won't be disappointed.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Since this is my type of story, I enjoyed it. I am going to read his 2nd. one next to see if I get hooked on this series.
B00427X9WI|5.0|Can I just say I think every woman needs a Champion and not man.  I really wish I could do what Julia Roberts character did.  I just purchased the book, because I always try to watch the movie before reading the book. But I love this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Amazing, frustrating, romantic, erotic & downright mysterious!! Keeps you guessing at every turn and can't wait for the next book!!!
0399159347|1.0|I quit reading this book after about 30 pages. It doesn't connect and I didn't want to waste anymore time reading the book. My only regret is I would love my money back and get the book off of my Kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want to have this game for kindle free because I don't have enough money to buy it but I couldn't git it its a cool game
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Really hate update.  Only reason it shows 3.5 stars is they averaged from years ago when it was a good app.  Should only include reviews on apps since their latest update! Otherwise people may think this is a good app!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill Climb will be the best choice u ever made. Hours of entertainment, tons of fun, and see how far u can get before running out of gas or crashing. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANYONE!!!!!!! = D
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Is an excellent book just a little bit big but is pretty nice if you have time enough to red it.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Not a bad book. Great character development with Indi and Eli. Cassia remains nothing more than an average character nothing truly special. I loved ky in this book however I wish Xander was in the novel more. The lack of him did take away from the book. Overall not to bad of a story but also not one of my favorites. If your looking for a complex love triangle I recommend finding a different book. Simple conflicts and no drastic problems in any case it seems like everything works out pretty well for Cassia in all but a few cases.
B00006FDCD|1.0|This product said it was in good to great condition.....WHERE WOULD THAT BE???  The inside is broke as to not to be able to hold the dvd and it has tons of scratches on it.  I suppose if it were in a tsunami and was at sea for 6 months and washed ashore somewhere it would then be considered good to great condition
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Love this movie. Went back and watched Thor and Captain America after watching this movie.  They are all very good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game to when you have free time on your hands. And it's free, you don't have to spend money if you don't want to.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|As other have written, the 3D version sets a (high) benchmark for how a 3D movie should be made and transfered for home viewing. Bravo James Cameron.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|It's one of the best books I have read. It keeps you hooked the whole time you're reading it. It is the perfect psychological thriller for a rainy afternoon.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is a great story and a great movie.  The visuals are just stunning and the 3D version enhances it.
1452110581|5.0|Loved this little book so much I bought one for a gift. Captures true feline character (or at least human perception of it). If I need a quick laugh, I pick up this book and read a poem or two.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|We love the movie, but this 3D &#34;repurposing&#34; ads nothing to it.  In fact, we found it dark, grainy, and my wife asked if we could put on our 2D Blu-Ray edition.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Great entertainment from one of the best groups in the history of music. Last chance to see the Brothers, before tragedy hit.
B009SH5JS4|5.0|Rather than review the movie (which we love), let me address the transfer to Blu-Ray.  The previous DVD lacked detail and at times showed significant distortion. This new transfer to Blu-Ray is a huge improvement. Color and details are as they should be, at last. It's a good film and the new transfer makes it so that the transfer doesn't get in the way of watching and enjoying it.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Sometime it doesn't send the message right a way but overall it is awesome I love this app and I hope you do too
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Once again James Rollins has written an excellent adventure story combining fact and fiction.  I especially like how he explains at the end of the novel what is real and what is not.  I certainly learn something every time I read his books.  I sure hope he doesn't run out of material to write about.  Great writing James!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because it was very unsettling.  I'm sure many in my age group fear Alzheimer's, so this was quite a glimpse into what is in store for us, especially since we are also living longer, giving us a larger window of opportunity.  I found the book well written, and I'm looking forward to my book club discussion.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Have enjoyed this app for traveling to/from work on the train.  Very user friendly & highly recommended for a novice.
B009LXECF6|4.0|Liked the tracks.  No cursing on this version, awesome.  Not the greatest cd i've heard, but pretty good.  Bruno Mars is great.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|proves Don Felders book that Glenn is a Rat  The old video shot as a Western movie is classic stuff
B00CFOXBX2|2.0|I really enjoyed the first half of the movie even though it was depressing and I thought it could have been an interesting conspiracy movie. Then they threw in the twist. It's been done before. It was well acted and i found it entertaining, but what could have been really interesting and thought provoking turned typical an hour in.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I could not put this book down!!! Everyone should read it!!! I recommend this book to everyone! A must read
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|would get another one when it is back in stock. this product sells out quick! Amazon keeps me updated & i received faster than expected date! thankyou!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|My 2.y year old was still able to play parts of this and he enjoyed it.  There is a risk that he might acidentally purchase something since money items keep popping up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Recommend this to ANYONE at all your love it 400 pages 20 chapters loved every part of it good book!!!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I just love the way these characters are together and I feel like they have finally been potrayed very well.  I have always been a big fan of the Timothy Dalton version from the 80's. It is extremely good. He definetly portrays the tortured Edward to a 'T'. I love him in it, but Toby Stephens does a great job as well. Not as gruff and angry, but still very close. I like this Jane the best of any I've seen. She is spot on to me with one exception. I don't recall a makeout scene when she is telling him goodbye. LOL. But it fits very well and I enjoyed it.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|This is one of the greatest books I have EVER read. Full of wonderfully unexpected twists and surprises, it keeps you turning pages right up until the end. The characters are deep and complex, their relationships realistic and un-cliché. HIGHLY recommended!
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I just love this movie. So sweet and funny. I have seen it online many times, but wanted my own copy. My only disappointment in this DVD is that they have edited out a couple of sweet scenes. Small as they were, I missed them.<br /> I don't understand why anyone finds the need to edit out content from an original version if they are selling it. If they are showing it on tv I get it, but not this. I wanted every last minute of it. Not happy about that.<br />But, all said, I love these characters. You just wont get to see all that I saw.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was better than book one, but I must know what happened to peeta.  He was so good ans loved katniss so much.  Book two. Was suspenseful, and entertaining.  Bring on book three.
B009R659L8|4.0|It was a good read, entertaining and not long and draggy.  She kept up the pace and it was the end before the pieces all fit together.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Vintage Gaiman. The battle between Good and Evil in an unlikely setting. Gaiman's plot and unusual characters keep the reader looking forward to the next chapter. It is a book that ends too soon.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|After looking at some of the reviews I never gave this movie a chance. Happened to be at a friends house and we watched this and we were both pleased beyond imagination. Tom Cruise is just rock solid. Simple little part I know but if you get this pay attention to the part where he is trapped in the hole trying to fix the drone and watch how he handles the scene with the assault rifle he uses. Guy prepares for these movies like few do. Morgan Freeman as always top notch. Loved the story and was a little shocked at how some reviews just didn't get it. The movie is actually really easy to follow and will bring you through the complete emotional cycle and do it well which I really enjoy in any movie. The living pads in the sky were a nice touch and the harrier like jet was pretty damn cool. Should have figured out some things much sooner than I did but I loved it well done.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is a compelling, sophisticated read with clever twists and turns and tantalizing psychological underpinnings. It is similar to Scott Turow's books Presumed Innocent and Innocent (and somewhat derivative of these works) but nonetheless I highly recommend Defending Jacob.
B0049J2CKE|3.0|Four stars seemed high since it was not a step under the best kids movies I have ever seen (five), but it was better than &#34;ok&#34;.  The kids liked it, there were no long and slow sections, and no overemphasis of some lesson that they were trying to teach.  In general, the kids liked it, there were some funny parts, and I would not mind watching it again.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever.  A must read for everyone. Mystery, Intrigue, friendship, adventure- they're all here.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Let's face it, it's a free game. it's fun. Be happy. It wontbchange the world, but it will provide a few smiles for free.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book is a factual story of Dr. Alexander's experience in the afterlife before coming out of his coma. It is his true story and gives the reader an idea of what happens when we die, or have a near death experience, which was what happened to him. What adds credibility is that he is an accomplished neurosurgeon with day to day experiences over the years with patients who die or have about died and didn't really believe in their stories or those NDEs that Dr. Moody or others have written about. Now Dr. Alexander believes because of his experience.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This book is a great second book in the moral instruments series and I can't wait to read the city of glass!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|First off I love Denzel Washington! He is a great actor and he really shines in this movie, I would recomend this  to any fan or not well worth watching!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game goes along with the type of game I like. Totally cute. Don't like how much you have to use the grub tokens cause they are so rare.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Very very good movie, has a fantastic meaning to it!  You will not be disappointed trust me! Great for the old and the young and inbetween....
B009O2XY12|2.0|Didn't like that you have to buy the chance to play the game once.<br />Looks like somebody tried to redo the bubble shooter thing but didn't really improve it.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|BEST BOOK I'VE READ SO FAR! Better than the first book and a lot more intense. This book easily rivals my favorite series' (Sword of Truth, Divergent, and The Hunger Games).
B00AR83PN4|2.0|When I opened it there was n instructions and I had no clue how to play. Did not like it
0061900656|5.0|This book held my granson's attention.  He is very proud and excited to become a big brother.  It matches the tee shirt very nicely.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I totally love this game. I tend to like games without levels. Sort of arcade type games. I love it
B00BCOQSSQ|1.0|I loved the premise, but the story sorely lacks in descriptive details.  For example, &#34;an interesting-looking creature&#34; is mentioned bringing an object into a room, with NO further information.<br />The writing reminds me of the original interactive fiction stories that came out in the eighties before graphics were available. &#34;Turn east.&#34;  &#34;You have entered the eastern cavern. There is a strange light glowing.&#34;<br />I would like to see this story after serious editing and the addition of several hundred pages in rich description. There just isn't enough detail to permit the reader to imagine a fantasy land.<br />I also think the first chapter should be a prologue so that the reader gets the idea of a normal life at college before Owen experiences the fantasy world.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|My nephew loves this game although he doesn't quite get how. to play it and has to ask me to help and I don't like it nearly as much
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|While I would actually give this app 4 stars, all the one star reviews by the Permission Nazi's force me to give it 5 to compensate. I agree there are many permissions, but I don't think they are for devious purposes. better explination would need nice, but it doesn't detract from a good software experience.<br /><br />I wish people get off their permission high horse, and rate the app for what it is, and add permission concerns to their reviews with a deduction, but not an automatic 1 star. Those are useless reviews
B008JFUPK8|2.0|The Good: The special effects are phenomenal. The fight scenes capture the feel of the Superman: animated series with Superman putting baddies through buildings. Henry Cavill does a solid job with what he is given to work with. From an acting standpoint, Russell Crowe is the best thing about the movie. The movie also presents some interesting twists on the mythology of Superman (or as they refer to him in this movie, Kal-El).<br />The Bad- The plot, despite all it's tweaks to the known story is at an elementry school level. That may work for some action movies, but for Superman, with 70 years of history I expect a lot more. Here is the plot: General Zod wants to build Krypton on earth. Superman must stop him. There are no sub-plots, good dialogue, character development, and most importantly, no real emotion in this film. Superman is extremely stoic. In the far superior Christopher Reeve films (1,2), you can see Superman take joy in getting a cat out of a tree or saving a kid from plunging to his death at the Niagra falls. He throws a light-hearted quip 'Sorry, only one ride per customer' and flies off. That element was sorely lacking in this film. I guess this is the 'Nolan-ized' version of Superman. Unfortunately, brooding is not an adjective that should ever apply to Superman. So it misses by a mile in terms of characterization.<br />The Deal: This movie is a bootleg view at best. For a movie with virtually no story, this thing drags for nearly two-and-a-half hours. The best comparsion I can make for this film is that of Star Wars: Episode II, great special effects, but you could care less what happens to any of the characters. Chris Nolan should take a break, between the overthought and convoluted 'Dark Knight Rises' and now this. It looks as if he is suffering from a case of burnout. Any chance they can reboot Superman a third time? They ain't building a franchise based on this movie. It's only marginally better than the loathed 'Superman Returns' This movie hasthe feel of a Michael Bay movie, explosions for the sake of explosions.  In other words, it's a dumbed down version of Superman, enjoyable special effects and some cool scenes, but I expected something that would do superman justice. This ain't it.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|After following a plant based whole food diet for two years and reading as much research article reviews and books I can consume supporting the topic, I can honestly conclude that mcdougalls guidelines are the simplest to follow and make the most sense--economically and healthwise.  His next book should be titled, the human diet. As human being we all deserve to read this book or any book promoting a whole plant based diet.  Havent you been to the community pool or beach this summer? Noticing less and less healthy looking people? Setting an example may be the best solution.

B003U6BE8I|1.0|Didnt bother watching it because the quality was so crappy. It was streaming at &#34;HD&#34; quality but when used as full screen, quality drastically dropped. Do not bother unless you are watching this on a phone or tiny tv. Not good for 59&#34; TV.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|The spirit of independent film is very much alive in Debra Granik’s “Winter’s Bone.” Granik—a recipient of multiple Sundance Film Festival awards—presents the world of “Winter’s Bone” in a manner that alters conventional mainstream cinema’s perspective on gender roles, while using a rich visual style to convey contextual symbolism, demonstrating to the audience independent film’s potential to innovate upon and adopt from the history of storytelling.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree, a young sister who dons the persona of backwoods detective to unravel the mystery of her father’s disappearance, meeting all likes of dangerous folk along the way. Lawerence’s performance is powerful and a definite precursor to her later work in “Hunger Games.” Aim for “Add to Cart,” and prepare to enter the gritty hillbilly-noir world of “Winter’s Bone.”

B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is the 1 to own for the franchise aficionados and fans of well supplemented Blu-rays. “Alien: Anthology” contains more bonus material than you could shake a flamethrower at: “MU-TH-UR Mode,” an interactive Weyland-Yutani Database; 12-hours of quality in-depth interviews with cast and crew; “Alien: Evolution,” and other fantastic featurettes; plus the bonus material from the “Alien Legacy” set and even the Special Edition Laser Disc set’s bonus material (you can finally put away your Laser Disc player). Coupled with the theatrical releases, Director’s cuts, and other special additions for each of the four films, “Alien: Anthology” judges other Blue-ray box sets and finds them wanting.<br /><br />The franchise where the best and brightest cut their teeth: Sir Ridley Scott (“Blade Runner” & “Gladiator”), James Cameron (“The Abyss” & “Terminator 2”), David Fincher (“Se7en” & “Fight Club”), Jean-Pierre Jeunet (“The City of Lost Children” & “Am&eacute;lie”), and Joss Whedon (Everything that is good at Comic Con) top the list of creative talent that left their indelible mark on the Alien mythology. Push “Add to Cart,” for hours upon hours of guaranteed television face hugging!

B008K7RGA2|1.0|I did it again, I have tried another Tosca by Ms Gheorghiu. in my defense I  have to  say that  Terfel  was there so I thought: Why not? So  I  sat before the tv for 2 painful hours.<br /><br />This was il bacio  de Tosca indeed!. I confess I  am quite particular for this opera. I  have my all time favourite which maybe is  not the best, the one with Vixell, Caball&eacute; and Carreras, but at  least  I  can hear them when the music is playing. Pappano does his  best but Ms Gheorghiu cannot, cannot be heard above the music and , dear if you cannot sing Tosca do not  do  it. And her performance could have been good at  the 19th century but  not now. She confuses drama with being over dramatic. She is too affected, pompous and lacks in subtility. We do  not  need to  see that  every dramatic phrase in the second act should be accompanied with twirling your arms or falling every five seconds. That is not acting , that is bad acting. The killing of Scarpia is painful to  watch and the great finally of the act with the Avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma is definitely and completely killed by her acttitude. So jump  Tosca after this crime.<br /><br />Mr Kaufmann is a very interesting tenor, it has a certain dark quality in his voice, a nice spinto  tenor. But it is  not a surprise I like him considering I  adore Placido  Domingo. I  liked him in Carmen at  the Covent Garden, his  D. Jose was beautiful, dramatic and masculine. But I  find him a little lost playing Cavaradossi. Not that he does not sing beautifully, I liked his e lucevan le stelle. But at the begining of the first  act  I  think he is not a charming Cavaradossi, I  mean he must be a tortured hero in the second, and definitely in the third. But come on give the guy some sense of humor.<br /><br />And the come Bryn, I  adore Bryn, he is a bass-baritone, could be anything better? He can sing Sweeney Todd beautifully. I adore Terfel, he has  all, the voice , the presence , the strength...but , for the life of me I  do  not  know what is  he doing in this  Tosca. Where is  the Scarpia of Valencia? The Scarpia of Amsterdam?  And the problem is not that  he cannot sing, he does wonderfully but, it was necessary that mocking face  and that lip twist all the time? When you see his  Scarpia in this  production is when ou realize that Mr Jonathan Kent, the director of this production, has not the slightest  idea of  what this opera is all about. Scarpia is a villain not an idiot. He has base instincts but my dear man, he is a little more sophisticated than that. The whole second act, the moment of glory for the rol is reduced to a wobbling, lascivious , uneducated Scarpia. Bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />Spoletta is another disappointment. In the second act before explaining what  happened with Angelotti he says:Sant'Ignazio m'aiuta!. This means that poor Spoletta is afraid to  tell the news , but it seems that this subtile suggestion of the libretto is completely lost to Mr Francis. Being afraid does not mean to have tics.<br /><br />So far at  this  point, when I even disliked Spoletta the problem must be  somewhere outside the singers. Because they are good singers. So my accusing finger is directed to Mr Jonathan Kent. Yes, I  know, I  must  be in a minority because the guy seems to  be the new darling for directing an opera but personally I am not impress. He has done so  far other Toscas with even Mr Alagna  but really I cannot stand his vision of  Tosca. The first act was basically the same set than the one of La arena de Verona with Marton, Aragall and Vixell. The second his version of any other Scarpia office and the third a wagnerian recreation of Castel Sant'Angelo. I do not doubt he was the soul of Almeida theater or that his Don Giovanni at Glyndebourne was a mystical experience but is he did what he did here...poor Mozart. So 1 star and only because I  think the orchestra and Pappano deserve some credit for being there all the time. Poor souls what they have had to endure.not  know what is  he doing in this  Tosca. Where is  the Scarpia of Valencia? The Scarpia of Amsterdam?  And the problem is not that  he cannot sing, he does wonderfully but, it was necessary that mocking face  and that lip twist all the time?

The first act was basically the same set than the one of La arena de Verona with Marton, Aragall and Vixell. The second his version of any other Scarpia office and the third a wagnerian recreation of Castel Sant'Angelo.

B00003CXFG|5.0|Pitch Black is a wonderful combination of science fiction, horror and drama all in one movie.  This is the first time the Riddick character is seen in a movie.  Vin Diesel was born to play this tough, vicious and strange anti-hero Riddick character.  He is a prisoner on a space ship which crash lands on what first appears to be an uninhabited planet with two suns.  After the crash landing, Riddick was no longer on the ship.  After one of the bounty hunters was killed by an unknown thing, the group began hunting for Riddick, who they think killed the bounty hunter.  This quickly changes when the group discovers the planet is not uninhabited and there vicious creatures who are sensitive to light, but come out in the dark.  The planet also rotates so that it becomes &#34;PITCH BLACK.&#34;  This is when the horror begins for the group.  Riddick winds up leading the group in the dark to someplace safe, but as you know, things never go as planned.<br /><br />This movie sets the stage for the sequel, &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34; as well as the animated version, &#34;Dark Fury&#34; to come out.  Since I am looking forward to the newest Riddick movie to come out in two weeks, I again watched Pitch Black, Dark Fury and The Chronicles of Riddick.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you have not seen Pitch Black yet you may want to check it out before seeing the newest Riddick movie due out soon.  In fact, you may want to check out all three previous Riddick movies.  I like all the Riddick movies thus far and look forward to seeing the newest one.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Predator Hunter: A warrior's memoir)

B004PJG7MW|4.0|I have fond memories of this movie from my youth, so when my daughter asked for a movie night this weekend we settled on watching this.  Se loved 'number 5' and the simple humor, as did I.  It is chock full of over-acting, and has some terrible special effects in the beginning; all part of it's charm.  I was unprepared for the language however, there was quite a bit of strong cursing for a PG movie.  I don't remember that part from when I was younger, hopefully my 8 year old will not as well.

B001NAT05W|4.0|This is a fun movie. NOT serious. So if you never read comic books or watch comic cartoons (all females?), you will get a kick out of this movie and wonder why is it so badly rated. Comic fans HATE it because the CatWoman character doesn't quite fit her mode.

0446699616|2.0|I'm a big fan of Nelson DeMille and love his jokes and snappy remarks. But this went on way too long and just wasn't very good. The plot was weak and predictable. Not much tension despite the locale and the circumstances. Read one of his earlier books like Gold Coast or Night Fall to see what he can really do.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I thought this film was pretty good. The premise is to tell the Classic story &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; with Muppets playing the parts. Though the main character &#34;Scrooge&#34; is not played by a Muppet, almost all the other characters are. It is comical and tells the story about as well as most other movies based on the book. It isn't really my favorite Muppet movie, and probably rates on the lower end of them, but it's decent enough for a new look on &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34;.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|It was a touching and moving movie.  What a great visual tour of India.<br /><br />The actors were the best and at the top of their game.<br /><br />Refreshing change from the junk movies seen this summer.
B005IEGUDY|1.0|This book is roughly 1000 pages that I forcibly had to read over summer for my upcoming AP course and let me tell you, I hate this book. And so do the rest of my classmates. This novel is over done with long pages of description and doesn't get to the point. They talk about 13 year old girls breasts being &#34;firm&#34; and &#34;round&#34; when in reality, girls don't usually develop breasts like that until around 16. It's awkward having so many sexual scenes with girls so young. This just isn't my type of book.

B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|Why am I saying Kurt Cobain would be proud? Well,Seether is the new nirvana.Here are my reasons why they are.<br /><br />1-The lead singer has a raspy grunge voice that is similar to Kurt Cobains.<br /><br />2-the guitars have a grunge sound that really resembles nirvana.<br /><br />3-The songs are nirvana like<br /><br />4-All the songs they do are grunge influenced.<br /><br />5-Cobain would be happy,because Seether has continued the grunge that nirvana fans miss,and Seether seems to like nirvana,since they sound so alike.<br /><br />Now my review for Disclaimer 2<br /><br />1-all 20 songs are very good and all sound a little unique.<br /><br />2-Its only 5 dollars for the mp3 album,plus you get 20 amazing songs.<br /><br />3-The band seems to be in tune on disclaimer 2.<br /><br />4-The guitar riffs are very haunting and creative.<br /><br />5-Seether is very good at what they do,and that is make grunge like music with creative songs.<br /><br />6-all the songs are somewhat about the band members lives.like for the first song called gasoline,It says,shes got bills to pay,and later in the chorus,they say,shes got no one to hate,execpt for me.Now that really is a personal song in my opinion<br /><br />7-What other Australian singer sounds as good as the one for Seether?<br /><br />8-And finally the second broken song has amy lee in it,she is with evanescence.<br /><br />Hopefully, I was somewhat helpful with my review of Disclaimer 2.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|Layken is not looking forward to moving to a new place, especially in her senior year of high school. But after her father's death her mom thinks that it would be better for the them to move closer to family. Immediately after arriving, she meets Will, the attractive young neighbor across the street. She is charmed by his sense of humor and good looks and soon agrees to go out with him. The date is not what she expects it to be at all, but everything she never know she wanted. Within a couple of hours she is feeling hopeful that this move was going to bring her a new start in life. If only.<br /><br />Not only is Will charming, funny and handsome, he is everything she ever wanted in a boyfriend and the very man she can't fall in love with. He is her teacher at her new high school. Add to that some unsettling news from her mother and you got yourself a doozy of a story.<br /><br />I so enjoyed this story.<br /><br />It's rare for a book to make me question my reactions and touch me so deeply at the same time. This book did both.<br /><br />I felt for Layken. Her sorrow at finding her perfect partner and not being able to be with him was very palpable. She was not only frustrated but heartbroken. At eighteen years old she felt she was independent enough to make her own decisions, but this one was taken right out of her hands not only by her mother but by Will himself. As a mother, I was conflicted. I wanted them to stay away from each other. But as a reader and a hopeless romantic, I wanted them to be together and say \\"The hell with this!\\" It was a rollercoaster of sort that left me confused in my stance about teacher/student relationship. Especially when I took Layken and Will's ages into consideration. Was it really that awful?<br /><br />And Will. Oh, my poor Will. I could completely see that he was captivated by the young woman across the street. It seemed she brought out the best in him and I didn't want to see that light be dimmed by the decision he so strongly stood behind. He HAD to stay away, since so much was riding on his shoulders at the time.<br /><br />And just went I was accepting their fate and looking forward to seeing Layken settle into her senior year, Colleen Hoover threw me a nasty curve. What happened next not only crushed Layken it destroyed the somewhat happy acquaintance Will and Layken had achieved after agreeing to go their separate ways.<br /><br />It was heart-brake to the twelfth degree with a bit of attitude, selfishness and denial thrown in there too. I found myself hoping for a miracle while at the same time enjoying all the angst. It was like nothing I've ever felt.<br /><br />The writing was superb, with every emotion jumping off the page and making me feel like a part of the story. I struggled along with Layken and Will, cried at the injustice of it all and in the end the feeling at seeing everything come to pass was bittersweet. I enjoyed the poetry, the secondary characters and the music references the author included in the story. From beginning to end I was riveted to the story and didn't want it to end.<br /><br />Slammed is the first book in the Slammed series and a phenomenal start at that. As a reader that enjoys dual POVs, I'm immediately immersing myself in Point of Retreat. I can't wait to get into Will's head and learn all about his thoughts and feelings.stood behind.

B00DGABUIC|5.0|I am not a fan of the word &#34;cute&#34;, but there is just no other word for this: big eyes, chunkier than the more streamlined adult Toothless, and yet, still Toothless.<br /><br />THINGS TO KNOW:<br />He is slightly smaller than the average adult woman's fist: 2&#34; high (top of head to floor), 3.5&#34; long (nose to tail), 2&#34; wide at widest point.<br />I bought him for my desk, but some things to know if he's intended as a toy: the head swivels full-circle, but horizontally only (think the old Barbie heads...no angles or up & down). The legs have no movement options at all.<br />He is more a statuette than an action figure: do not expect moving parts. That said, I doubt anything will break off either. The protruding pieces are a slightly flexible plastic, there is a very nice &#34;scale&#34; texture to him and the details are very good. His eyes have huge pupils, are otherwise green and look up to his right.<br /><br />And one more thing...because this is not just &#34;Mini-Toothelss&#34;, it seems to actually be Baby Toothless...the tail is all dragon...<br /><br />* * * MOVIE SPOILER AHEAD * * *<br />...unlike the post &#34;How to Train Your Dragon&#34; Toothless, who has the mechanical tail attachment.
1400049628|5.0|My son wanted this book he said it is a great book to read. It gives information you may need
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|This product is wonderful and works as advertized. But the app needs some updating and added features. I updated to the recent firmware and the app still crashes every time I plug in a drive that has many files and large capacity. I connect my MobileLite with a Mercury Browser and Files Connect from the iTunes app store. The MobileLite works better with these apps.
B004SRNH10|3.0|Only downloaded this software as a pre-requisite for another application. I have not designed any apps for use with Adobe AIR, so I can only assume the program is working as intended. I have had no issues with the software.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish it was longer though. But it was still fun. I  make you think more than the 100floors games. There was more involved to open the doors to get to the next level.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|This app is very quick and easy to use. It makes both searching for products and also purchasing very simple.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The visuals were great! The story line, not so much. It was underdeveloped, as were the characters. Even the music in the movie didn't seem to fit quite right.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|This application provided exactly what I would expect from an eBay application. You can log into the application, view and monitor bids and create new bids. I did not attempt to perform any sales from the application, but I did check and monitor bids, and it was effective.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This book takes a few chapters to get going, but once it did it was so good!  There were funny quips, just like the show. And of course the homemade margaritas were a sexy little twist.  It was a great read & I fell more in love with the caskett couple.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Great book! It's a classic. The ebook looks great and is easy to read. I enjoyed this! Would definitely recommend.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Good chase / run game. My 3 yr old son likes to play it, but I find it a little boring and repetitive.
B004SCN2F6|4.0|This game is very much a throwback to the old BBS game, Trade Wars 2000. Pick a faction, start hauling and colonizing and building your trade empire - all classic gameplay and translated very well to Android. I enjoyed this a lot, and would definitely buy it again.<br /><br />(Review text same as review for Star Traders RPG as Elite version has no ads)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This has turned into my 3 yr old son's favorite game. He loves this little game. Wish it varied tracks a little bit more.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|This is a 2 cd set was very impresses with both cd's every song was in true buddy guy fashion.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Masterpiece does do such a great job in bringing good series for us to enjoy...this show is very good but I don't think kids would watch.  It's clean, funny, and I do like watching shows that reflect another era.
0375842209|5.0|My daughter loves to read books and this one was right up her alley with books. She loves to get books anyways she can and this book for her mad perfect sense.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|We love it, love it. It had a lot of features that we were not expecting. Watch out for the slippery bottom, add the tub grips like another consumer advised makes it safer. Adjusting the water is tricky but take your time and you will figure it out. Tip, slow down the water coming from your water source and this helps a great deal.<br />Great Buy.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Not very helpfull.  I thought it would improve the perfomance of the Office Suite package.  Turns out nothing can improve it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's made watching youtube and netflix on our big TV an awesome experience. Picture quality is great. Ease of setup/use unbeatable. Thanks Google!
B004498KPU|2.0|Set of 3 dvd came with cd #1 repeating instead cd#1 cd#2 cd#3 so I returned I afraid if i buy again it come in the same way,
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have tried several other apps for Mahjong but this version sounds, looks and plays most closely to the earlier version I enjoyed the most.
B008PNBU30|4.0|It really puts into words how I feel at that moment!!! I am loving the music and so is my 5 yr. old daughter!!!
0061478784|5.0|Saw the movie many times before I realized it was based off of this book. I enjoyed noting the differences between the two.
B005R9HK8O|5.0|I am delighted to let you know that the service and product were excellent. A good book to share!! Thanks for all!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was hesitant to choose this book having loved &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;. Maybe Hosseini will ruin his reputation I thought. It's true that this latest novel is not as memorable or as intense as the Kite Runner, however, it is true gem and it certainly helped me through some hot summer days. A perfect holiday read.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|It really fit what was going on in my life right now it was weird but helped me understand a little better!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This is a highly entertaining little read about being different. Wittily written with excellent observations about those who don't quite fit the &#34;normal&#34; spectrum. Don is a professor of genetics (high on the geek scale) whose life is utterly prescribed and organised, even down to the search for a wife. He embarks on the &#34;Wife Project&#34; only to discover that the best fun is often unpredictable and unscheduled.
B00AEFXZJE|5.0|This is a terrific older movie with a great romantic plot and awesome dancing.  I really enjoyed it.  The packaging and arrival times were well done and expedient.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Hard to read and keep up with characters.  Once you get hooked, it's hard to put down.  The ending leaves you with lots of questions
B00005JKG5|5.0|This is a terrific older movie with a great romantic plot and awesome dancing.  I really enjoyed it.  The packaging and arrival times were exceptional.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I love hidden object games, especially one that you can keep playing! Need more like this one!
B0000524E5|5.0|This is a terrific older movie with a great romantic plot and awesome dancing.  I really enjoyed it.  The packaging and arrival times were well done and expedient.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|One of the best services on the Internet. I have it on all my devices. I just hope they continue to grow and offer more features. One day I hope to be able to use their services like I do with Google drive.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|My only complaint is that book three isnt available yet! I read through the 1st and 2nd books in a week.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A science fiction novel with unlikely characters and thought fulfilling lessons.  Quite an accomplishment!  If they make a movie, I hope they avoid CGI effects and concentrate on a mix of drama and action.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Nice game. No need at all to purchase anything with real money. Only down side, hard to find neighbors. Have to have. Facebook account and find ppl over that. So far I have only 1 neighbor.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very well thought out by the author but totally NOT my thing. The ending was anticlimactic so be ready for that. In the end, I disliked all the main characters. I'm never happy with a book that leaves me feeling this way.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|THANK GOD there is a real live Mitch RAPP!!  I wish those stupid statesmen who know nothing about  What Chris talks about in this book would pay close attention!!!<br />VERY ENLIGHTENING BOOK. 5 stars.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I'm a new fan of Gregory's, introduced to her by The White Queen. After finishing that book I rushed out to buy all of her books, choosing this one to read next. I'm quite disappointed. Elizabeth was nothing like her mother. I wanted to see more insight, more plot twisting, more of her coming into her own. Instead, what I got was damsel in distress whose vocabulary contained more, \\"I don't knows,\\" than I care to remember.<br /><br />All in all I expected more. I will read the other books I have in my collection, hoping that they do not disappoint me in this same fashion.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I watched the original Wizard of Oz from age 6 to..... I always enjoyed the film, its stars, and the lessons learned.  I even shared much of this movie with my own kids when they were quite young.  Yet this remake succeeded in presenting a new and fresh approach to the movie and its themes that answered some suggested and unanswered questions of the original work.  This was fun, refreshing, inspiring, and yet personal.  Keep this in our library for replay and keep the original in your heart as a keepsake and comparison of the newest springboard.
052118939X|5.0|It is a amazing and complete book, realy the best in grammar. Very quick and direct examples, easy comprehension and understanding. Apendix and cd are very helpfull. I recommend.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|This was a twist I had not expected.  I purchased this film because I love the stars as they have played in other action and heart warming roles.  My imagination was challenged and excited by the trail followed.  Yours will be too.  Keep this in your library.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This is a fantastic game for everyone who loves &quot;hidden object&quot; type games.  I highly recommend &quot;Pirate Adventures&quot; to you.
B00CFA222M|5.0|I wonder if Jack of the Beanstalk would recognize himself in this one?  Fun, daring, imaginative for the young people, yet a welcomed updates for those of my generation (just guess; I have been around a while).  Smile
B003ODL004|4.0|I had to purchase this album as Inception the film blew my mind. Hans Zimmer on this album blew my mind even more. I purchased this album to grow my Soundtrack Collection, and Zimmer seems to play a huge part in my addiction. What a great album of phenomenal scores.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|What can I say about this film? I loved it! Totally recommend it. Humour, intelligence, Michael Moore in one of its best movies.
B002LSI0N8|4.0|I wanted to get the Terminator 2 Skynet Endoskull, but I couldn't get it. So I picked up this Terminator Salvation when it was around $65.00USD. I hope the $3,000 price tag on it today (8/26/2013) is a mistake. It's not worth over $100.00 in my honest opinion. Like the T2 Endo you get the feature of light up eyes, and the Theme song playing in the background. This is just a Endo with no special features. I do love this Endo, and I think it looks great above my Movie Display Shelf, but I think the movie collector deserves a little more with their money. If you can pick him up for less than $100.00USD. Pick him up. If he's over that. Save your money or buy the T2 edition. He's dropping in price.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I like this game a lot I'm getting good at it  play everyday I've put money into it n got alotta  good cards that help my deck I have one question when does epic bosses bosses able to be played
B000009DUY|4.0|This album has to be one of the best coming from John Williams. I've listened to this album more than a dozen times. John Williams made a great score for each scene.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good story, very well done. Great for lawyers but also for non lawyers, really recommended for all kind of series lovers.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|If you don't get outside much, then this is the iPhone case for you- very minimal, but very thin. However, it does fit nicely in your pocket with this one on.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Fun and passes time. It keeps you entertained but it also can get on your nerves. Great App. If you have a boring day or want to pass time.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|It just became a bit slow in the middle and started jumping back and forth.  Lost interest  middle of book
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is challenging but fun to see how much you know about emojis even if you don't use em
B0034G4P94|4.0|I think this movie does MMA proud.  The plot line seemed rather thin and I don't know if i am keen on the Rocky metaphor, but all in all a great entertainment.
B004C03TJ8|5.0|I loved it, i thought i might have a problem because it came from Canada but it worked out great
B002XTXG1G|3.0|And maybe so is Hardy.  I just found it hard to connect to the nonsense.  That said, Hardy does introduce some am\suing moments and the physical transformation is impressive ala Robert Deniro.
1878424319|5.0|On the surface, Don's Toltec teachings might seem simple. However, the reality is we must go through some major self reflection to see just how damaging our \\"dreams\\" and the dreams we have been raised under are! In applying this knowledge in the moment, my life and the way I view those around me, has completely changed. I have put aside my assumptions, judgements and critiques to begin living a life of authenticity. To me, this book s a MUST READ if you wish to simplify your life, begin truly loving the people around you, including yourself, and to live the best life you can live! I have recommended this book to everyone I meet! I believe that if everyone adopted these behaviors, the world would be transformed!
B0054SMID0|4.0|Enough twists and turns to keep me interested. Matthew McC doesn't doesn't disappoint. Wish they had given Marissa Tomei a little more screen time. She is too talented to end up left on the cutting room floor for the most part.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|My oldest son had been requesting this movie for some time. When it arrived, we opened it right up and popped it in to watch. It's quickly become a favorite for both my sons - 23 years old and 2 years old.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Excellent story.  This was a pick for the book club that I belong to.  From the first page it held my interest.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Well minecraft is pretty fun but in my opinion there are other apps that are worth more than seven bucks that are free.  I do not think that this app's price should have been seven bucks.  There are not that many animals and it has some glitches sometimes.  However if you do want the minecraft idea I recomend this app if you have some money to spare.  If your not willing to spend this amount on this app then I also recomend Survivalcraft.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I don't read too much Chick-Lit but I was heading off for a beach vacation and wanted something fun and light to read. I ended up enjoying this book more than my usual genre. I had read shopaholic when it first came out and enjoyed it but I felt this book was much better. Kinsella excels at witty dialogue (internal too) and crafting likeable, quirky characters. I felt there were plenty of twists that kept my turning the pages. I'll be reading the rest of her books and I'm glad I didn't let the goofy cover make me pass this one over.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was so into this book, I read it faster than I've maybe ever read anything because I just had to see how it ended. And, meh. I'm not sure the ending lives up to the build up. But it was definitely a page-turner; I'll say that for sure.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There is nothing innocent about this book...it awakens feelings you never thought you could have...and you just wish there is no ending to the story. It is THAT good.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|A profound look into the world of Marilyn Manson. Was I shocked - extremely! However I read this with an open mind and thoroughly enjoyed the intensity at which Mr. Manson writes. It is said that there is a fine line between 'brilliance' and 'stupidity'. I think Mr. Manson sways more towards the brilliant side.
0425266060|2.0|Once you've read 50 shades of Grey, this is just a repeat of the same old thing. Had I realized that was way the story line was I wouldn't have ordered it..
B009XIXVU6|5.0|While reading this book you will quickly learn you need to pay attention to every character introduced!  Eventually every characters story is told.  I love the book, however, sometimes it is hard to recall who the person is they are talking about and how they connect to the big picture.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Surprising - interesting - captivating. Good acting, many talented famous actors. Moments of edge of your seat moments.Wish there were more R movies like this. I usually don't watch R. But this was mild for R.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|Was hoping it would be funny. I like Will Ferrell but this was just waste of time bad sex humor. Turned it off after 15 min. Waste of money.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Having a blast playing uno, loved it as a kid and love it as an adult. This game is fun for the whole family.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Matthew McConaughey surprised me in this movie. Great acting and the children are awesome actors too. Love the movie; keeps ya guessing.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Some good acting, which is unusual for sci-fi action. I watch movies to be entertained and this did it.<br /><br />Only minor challenge was that I figured out that the talking volume was deliberately low so that the loud scenes could be really loud. So crank up your volume at the beginning to hear the voices and leave it there if your ear drums and speakers can handle it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great acting, story, action, special effects, people dynamics, humor. One of the best shows I have ever seen. I just watched it again.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Always use Arctic Silver and never had an issue. Will continue to use it and recommend to anyone in this field
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|2013NR:<br />Here's the story of SOUND CITY, arguably rock n' roll's greatest music studio; the rock star recordings that made it famous; and the people who called it home (too numerous to mention).<br /><br />A tale of the legendary $75K Neve console responsible for countless platinum albums recorded there, and the dude who saved it from bubble wrap death by bringing it to Studio 606; this film is a testament to 'using technology as an instrument, not a crutch'.<br /><br />Sound City delivers to us just a little of the human feeling known as music, captured by those amazing machines. And shows Pro Tools as a major contributor to the death of 2 inch tape.<br /><br />I think Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac summed it up nicely @~1:21:18 when he said, \\"I think the downside these days is thinking that, 'I can do this all on my own'. Yes you can do this on your own, but you'll be a much happier human being to do it with other human beings, and I can guarantee you that.\\"<br /><br />If you hated Dave Grohl's success before this movie, you'll absolutely loathe it after he begins to release the next generation of rock n' roll masters off the Neve in Studio 606! Rock on brother. Enjoy. 5x MFJLabs
B0046UGSNS|1.0|Do not waste your time on this movie.  I was really looking to see a good story with a lesbian couple as the lead. But when cheating started i was disappointed.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This was a very good book I keep put assuming this \\"what will happen next\\" it's very well written and it's very pulling like you want to just keep reading
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Whether they live upstairs or below-stairs, the characters of Downton Abbey have real personalities, don't always get along, and don't intend to make any changes.  However, the post World War I world is different and is forcing changes upon every person.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Characters with no integrity, plot with unnecessary twists and turns, and generally tedious. If you like this sort of thing, have at it.
B00ARF92HK|3.0|Much better than Stallone's version and much more violent.  Know what you are signing up for when you rent/buy this title!
B000S1M9LY|2.0|I haven't made much headway in three months. I know it gets rave reviews. I know the author was beloved by many, but for me, it is puzzling at best. There are so many wonderful books from classics to current well-written novels. Am I really going to learn anything from this strange 1000 pages. People I respect say it is magnificent and funny. I think my funny bone has died, because I find what I have read so far, and that isn't a great deal, pretty gruesome. I'll keep on trying, but I may not make it.
B0015DWJ8W|5.0|Crisp, light and entertaining reading. Motivational of sorts, but in an unintentional manner which I think, makes it much more effective. When I first got this through word of mouth recommendation, I was a bit hesitant about reading a book of what a writer thinks when he's running. Well, it is a lot more than that, it is a memoir of sorts that can teach valuable lessons about risk, persistence and discipline in a very entertaining way.  I would really like to meet this guy in person and share a few minutes while doing a short run.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A very reliable app. I can't add much. I don't like the ads, but it's free so I can't complain. I like the options.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|An extraordinary look into  a culture many of us do not know. Makes you think about what we take for granted.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Got this to connect my mouse, keyboard, printer, and CD drive to my new Macbook Air with USB 3.0. Works like a charm. It also connects with my older Dell, an added bonus!
B00E00C70C|5.0|This turns your phone into a badass. A phone with servers can replace your need to have a always on pc and it comes with a back up battery by default.<br /><br />This gets 5 of 5 stars for ease of use and quality only because I couldn't figure out how to add extra stars.<br /><br />One feature I'd like is a  python server because php isn'y thing. I'm not going to whine about it though.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I think I may have seen all 200 episodes now.  I started when I was recovering from surgery last year and it is the only show I couldn't stop.  It's basically all I watch on TV, and I use Amazon instant video to hunt down the episodes I haven't seen.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I was/am a loyal Fitbit user. When I read about the Pulse I immediatly decided to get one.<br />The idea of integrating the Withings Pulse with their Smart Body Analyzer and their Smart Blood Pressure Monitor was very exciting.<br />Currently, I do not think that their is any other company that has this kind of integration with all these measurments. In addition to the regular measurments of Activity, Distance .... etc, the withings products also measure quality of Air, Heart pulse, BP,  ... etc<br />I got all three, the setup was quite easy and fun.<br /><br />The idea of Synching through an iPhone or Androide device instead of a computer was at 1st a little strange to me, but I found it much easier and much more fun.<br />I set all 3 to work with my iPhone 4 and with my Kindle Fire HD (Android Device)<br />I have been using the Withings products fo 2 days now and am really happy with them.<br />I would have rated them as 5 stars because although there are several companies selling such products, currently I do not see any competiton with the Withings product as explained above. Having said this, I am still using my fitbit Flex (together with the Withings Pulse) because I think that wearing a tracker in the hand is more conviniant than using a clip, because on the hand you will never have to take it off, you can even swim with it. This is why I will give it a 4 star instead of 5.<br /><br />I hope that Withings come out with a device simmilar to the pulse that can be worn on the hand like the flex.
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|It was nice enjoyable movie with a believable cast.  No violence.  Very human.  That being said, I found it pretty forgetable afterwards.
1938469011|5.0|I bought this for my fiance who is fairly new to making beer and absolutely loves this.  He says it goes into so much detail about hops he didn't even know existed.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not as good as the first two. Time jumps kind of confusing in the plot. I had trouble with the he/she back and forth. Great background as usual.
159463176X|3.0|Very disappointed in this book. Loved the first two but this one seemed just too fragmented and hard to follow. Was waiting so eagerly for it only to be dissapointed. Didn't live up to the first 2
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Has worked for me. Thank you so much. I am so glad you sent me the cord, Don't know what I have done.
B002EDH0FE|1.0|I fell asleep twice trying to watch this movie.  Too long, slow, predictable. Don't bother, it's a waste of time.  Just take a nap instead.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman does a great job of wrapping together a young boys memories with the creepy dark things that slip thru the cracks in reality.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Above average movie..  Great story line and cast.  The lack of the F word  and the MF made it an enjoyable family movies. The violence was acceptable but not excessive. (Done with purpose rather than for shock value
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a series that you can't stop watching.  It is nice to see this with no commercial and quality outstanding.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Another really great movie by Cruise.  Premise and screenplay were outstanding and should be noted by Oscar nomination.  Cruise seems to have the ability to pick out great story lines and then make them believable.  His personal life effect how he perceived in the movies but he seems to make us forget that part of his life as you a drawn into the story lines of whatever he is doing
B006AN78XS|4.0|I thought it was very creative.  I really enjoyed seeing Paris.  It made me want to go back to Paris and visit it at night
B00DW39B2K|3.0|A good movie but the premise was weak.  John makes a horrible, whatever nationality he was playing, and it was a pleasure when he died
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Very entertaining, it was well done.  Tom Cruise does a great job in this one.  It has an interesting twist at the end
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I paid. Full price for this book and don't regret it.  That's high praise for me.  Card again totally surprised me with this books ending, same as he did in Enders Game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather product.  Good graphics, great detail, alert intensive for Thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc. in timely fashion, flood warnings and much more.  For someone truly interested in weather, this appears to be the app you want.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The best book I  have read in a long time. The reader starts with one opinion and then finds they were wrong. The character development and story line are very cleverly crafted giving the reader lots to think about and constantly questioning their own opinion.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Action pack adventure.  Good sequel for the other Transformer movies.  Definitely a movie you want to watch from beginning to end because if you miss 5 minutes anywhere along the way, you have missed the movie.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really enjoyed this story of ordinary folk told with compassion and a good deal of humor. The main characters are extraordinarily well crafted, and the reader feels connected to their lives. I would recommend this book to all my friends.  .
B004GJDQT8|5.0|A great app for any Amazon.com customer.  Being new to the tablet/smartphone apps, it took a little getting use to.  For my Samsung tablet, I used this to initially get my apps.  But I never got an install version of the app.  They were all diverted to my google play app where I eventually found them and installed them on the tablet.  I eventually found the Amazon App program that retrieves and installs directly onto the tablet that makes things simpler.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled hosseini has never disappointed. Every word is there for a reason.A truly great page turner. I would recommend And the Mountains Echoed to anyone.
B00AEFYGPQ|4.0|I enjoyed this film.  It wasn't one of the best action films out there, but it was certainly entertaining.  Biggest lore about this film was probably the cast.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|My daughter download it by mistake. Didn't want it so I deleted it. I am sure it's good product but it was a mistake.
B001FB55YE|5.0|I wasn't exactly certain what this film was going to be like.  In truth, I only bought it because of Gerard Butler and Mark Strong.  However, I found the entire cast to be amazing and the story completely entertaining.  The overall concept was well thought out, and delivered even better.  This is definitely one of my favorite films I've purchased in the last year.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Loved this take of The Dark Knight saga and its approach.  They don't sugar coat in this series so I wouldn't recommend from small children as there are some adult approches to violence.
B00006JDVV|5.0|This wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I found it to be a great movie.  The dragons were well done and the plot was very entertaining.  I almost died laughing during the scene where Butler and Bale are acting out a scene from Star Wars for the children.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I devoured the first book in a day and quickly sought out this one. It was an easy read, with a cute story line, and very lovable characters.
0786958731|5.0|I was lucky enough to snag this off Amazon for $37.<br /><br />Just getting back into D&D.  Only playing 1st edition this was a big change.  It took a few rounds but it was very easy to catch on to the game play.  It was nice that a DM is not needed.  Every one gets to play.  The game comes with a 10 good scenarios that can be played out in about 2 hours.  Some were so good we played them again and just switched up characters.  The game comes with a nice selection of miniatures.  You get your money back on those alone.  The map system is interlocking squares that you put together at random.  So every time you play its a new map.  Also great for building your own maps.<br /><br />My only negative about this is some characters just seem a bit over powered.  With some of the treasure items there is only a 1 in 10 chance of missing your target.<br /><br />After playing this I kept my eyes out for Wrath of Ashardalon, and Castle Ravenloft.  I have played some Wrath and wished I had started with that one first.  All 3  can be mixed together if you choose.  I plan to use them in future regular D&D adventures and cant wait to make some of my own custom maps using the peaces that came with them.
B009NY43NY|5.0|There's no way for a fan of this series to review its last book subjectively. When you're hooked, you're hooked, and I was hooked a couple of chapters into the first book. Even for fans of the HBO series, True Blood, and the fact that the series has strayed far afield from the books, it's totally enjoyable. Wish it wasn't the final book in the series.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It was good to catch up on the characters. Not quite as much history as book one. Looking forward to book three.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|There is enough evil and pessimism in the world. I like a story which is uplifting, which this definitely is. We can laugh at people who try to see the bright side of things, but if we had more of them, the world would be a much better place.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very enjoyable game so far. Definitely enjoying my download! Price point isn't bad, worth the $0.99 purchase price. Fast tapping, quick thinking game, helps pass the time well.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is pure AWESOME it's super super fun!!!!  I play it when my fingers get tired from playing minecraft
B004SEUJK0|5.0|This is my must-watch movie after every breakup. (It's almost a cardinal rule.) I'm a recently single, thirty-year-old woman and I could very much identify with Bridget's love woes. I've been watching this movie since it first came out in 2001. I'm not in the habit of buying DVDs, but I bought this movie simply because it's timeless and absolutely endearing. Bridget Jones is one of my favorite heroines. She voices the fears of singletons everywhere. It's safe to say that there's a Bridget in every girl. She is a character you root and care for. She is sweet, guileless and irreverent. It's her foibles and vulnerability that makes her endearing. I invariably found myself cringing along with Bridget when asked, \\"how's your love life?\\" As a single girl, I've been asked this question one too many times. One of my favorite quotes by Bridget is: The only thing worse than smug married couple; lots of smug married couples.\\"  Colin Firth and Hugh Grant play their roles impeccably well. I found myself falling in love with Mark Darcy (played by Colin) every single time. As far as chick flicks go, this movie is one of the best! If you haven't watched it, then what are you waiting for? This movie is delightful, charming, and comical. You'll find yourself tearing in empathy for Bridget and in the next minute laughing. Plus, it has a great soundtrack! It'll tug on your heartstrings and make you wish that Mark Darcy would step into your life. Five stars!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a huge minecraft fan and I don't have minecraft pc edition or Xbox edition.<br />So I play pocket edition and I love it I've learned how to download mods and texture packs so that makes it so much more AWESOME. I give minecraft pocket edition a 5 star rating
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen's writings are every bit as entertaining as her stage performances.  Her quirky view of life and how she shares her experiences are such a delight and laugh-out-loud funny.  And her mom's a riot, too.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|what a time to have so many great artists come together at the right place by accident! Or is it destiny? Either way..a great story, a true story!
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love all of her historical fiction, well researched & I always learn something new. She gives a great picture in The White Princess of just how unsettled things were in Henry Tudor's England. I had always thought that Bosworth ended the War of the Roses, and hadn't realized how the uprisings for Lambert Simnel and later, Perkin Warbeck affected the entire country. Not a happy book, but definitely worth reading.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I would give this book to any of my friends. It's a great story a little sad but always good in the end.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|Lousy plot, influenced by Scientology. Wooden acting. Not enough action to justify entertainment value. We're fighting Aliens with technology indistinguishable from magic, using high powered rifles. And we win? And the Alien/aliens are what? Machine? God? a pissed off female from outer space? I would have given it 0 stars, but I liked the flyers.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Based on the fact I am able to read while on the go and give me an opportunity to research my assignments for school.
B00005JPS8|5.0|We are again...loving our movie! Excellent delivery and packaging! I had never done the 'gift' option, but it was great. He got a gift receipt with my little note on it. Such a great idea!<br />Thank you!
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|However while I liked it cause it did help with the sound, it did not really make it louder. I know maybe I'm expecting too much of a tablet to sound like a stereo but hey maybe something better will come along or they will improve it.
1490313370|5.0|I found this to be an inspirational look at who is responsible for my life. I cannot live my life, waiting around and hoping that someone will choose me to be successful.<br /><br />In short, that's the message of the book. You can choose yourself to live a life you desire. Because no one else will.<br /><br />But it's not about just one day deciding to do it and everything happens - no, there are specific steps you must take. Altucher would say that his goal is for people to read this and take steps to better themselves.<br /><br />His \\"Daily Practice\\" is not some hokey thing, but a way of slowly changing your mindset from a sour, the sky is falling attitude into a mindset where you ask yourself how you can overcome obstacles. It's a way of accepting responsibility for yourself. It helps change yourself into a positive person, instead of a negative person.<br /><br />One thing I like about the book is the very personable style of writing. Some may not appreciate it. It's written as someone would talk - short sentences. He says \\"I don't know,\\" enough of times.<br /><br />How do you make it in this economy? Choose yourself.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is simply a great show - with great characters, from a fascinating and changing period in history.  But be sure to watch it in proper order: start with season 1 and get into the story.

0307236722|2.0|I purchased this book used for the nectarine tart recipe.  I am a well experience, excellent cook.  I find Martha Stewart's recipes to be unnecessarily pretentious.  Her recipes often call for ingredients not known to the average cook, offering no explanations for substitutions for more readily available ingredients which would work equally well.  Her writing style is equally ostentatious. Reviewing her recipes, I am impressed that Ms. Stewart is more concerned with promoting her image than offering skilled instruction for preparation of the recipes she offers.<br /><br />Jorja Shannon
B009VIZDLI|3.0|It was amusing but a little over done in parts  which became a trifle irritating.  Three and a half stars

B00CM03H4C|5.0|I love this sound track  I listen to it in my phone, my car, my computer.  I just don't get tired of it. The thing here is that I like all kinds of music. This album  has different types of music.  Big band, electronic, hip hop. So Don't expected to be only big band or jazz.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it, cannot wait for season 4....Wish it was available now.  Love all the characters, young and old male and female.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book, well written and very interesting. It is suspenseful all throughout the novel. I thought it was exciting from beginning to end!
B001HN694K|5.0|The story everyone knows done expertly with Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.  Those two work so well together.  Awesome make up and effects.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Because August Pullman was born with such deformities and needed multiple surgeries, he hasn't been able to attend regular school until now. His face still causes all kinds of adverse reactions, and it's no different as he enters fifth grade. As he struggles to be accepted amid hostile students and adults and deal with bullying, he shows real courage to face each day.<br /><br />This is a heart-felt book that emphasizes how important kindness is. It has some great themes and values. I didn't like the references to reincarnation, but this doesn't negate the impact and importance of the rest of the book. At times, as the account is told from different character's viewpoints, the story drags, but, for the most part, it reads quickly. I'm glad there are children's books like this that show how imperative it is to be sensitive to the feelings and plight of others.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Heard this at a friends house and had to get my own copy.  Love it, not a bad song on the whole CD.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Absolutely amazing film.  Seven Oscar nominations and three awards isn't enough in my opinion.  It's a comedy and a tragedy in the same film.  Highly recommend!

B0006GVJEE|5.0|anyone who has not seen this film is missing one of the best films ever. Gary Oldman And Jean Reno at their best.
B008OJ291W|3.0|This re-recording has better definition, contrast and clarity. At the same time it lacks vibrancy and the spirit of the original recordings - a lot of it obviously was driven by the other original band members or the spirit of the times when the songs were recorded. Now it is not the 70ies and Jeff is not 25 years old and it shows. The feeling is gone. He might have been better off going on a world tour with a full blown orchestra and recording all these songs live. With modern technology he would have achieved great quality of recording (his main objective) and brought in some life in the recordings (live performances usually generate a very energetic atmosphere) which is missing in the studio recordings. And of course, there would be less synthesizers and more natural sound.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Thank you all for such a fun filled game but I love it<br />can we get more credits for longer playing time that will be even better thank.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is a great room, very entertaining.  The concept of the Null was a bit nihilistic for me. But it would be a best case scenario for an antagonist who is trying to summon the Accuser. Be careful what you wish for.

B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoyed the book and have been talking about it to friends and family for weeks now.  I even googled Cheryl Strayed.  Even though I gave it four stars, the book did disappoint me in some ways.  I kept waiting to see her mature as she advanced in miles, but it never happened.  She remained emotionally immature to the very end.  I found that strange, especially since she wrote the book so many years later after the hike.  On the other hand, maybe the book shows that you are who you are and a long hike is not going to fundamentally change that.<br /><br />I was also wishing that the book had some more information on her switch from being on the trail to going back to her &#34;off the trail&#34; life.  For me, she summed up the transition and the rest of her life too quickly at the end of the book.<br /><br />It was fun reading about her crazy adventures, but she didn't mine anything too deeply.
B000093FLA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. From start to finish you will be entertained. Non stop funny
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The product in question is subway surfers for kindle fire. I think this game is a brilliant little mini game to play on the go or if you have children or you are child. This game is fast paced but can get a little repetitive so don't play this non stop. It also has a world tour where you can play in different cities with different back grounds.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|It has a lot of character development taking place, so things are very slow to happen. But it's also for that reason that the show really is amazing. You get to know the characters well and the premise makes for good entertainment.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|This one of the best shows ever made! I was hooked from the very first season and wanted to relive all the excitement again :)
B009INAGY0|5.0|I chose to rate this a five star because that's what it disserves, this is that got death to start being more technical with the instrumental. I like chuck shuldiners vocals the most in this one, I can understand what he is saying because he sings more clear, and I like some of the weird yells he does when he sings.<br />I recommend this album to fans melodic death metal, because of how technical the instrumentals are and how great the vocals are.

B009KS4XRO|2.0|Love the game but it freezes up a lot and you can only get bonus tokens to play with cash only once you run out. If you hit the bingo by mistake it should tell you its a bad call but allow you to keep playing. Info on the game is not very clear and nobody responds to problem reports and your money and or game points are not refunded when the game messes up!

0375831002|5.0|This book is gut wrenching and hard to put down.  I really enjoyed it.  Hard to believe it is written by a male as the young female character is incredibly well written and insightful.  Just saw a preview for it in the theaters and I am so glad I read the book first, although the movie does seem to have captured the imagery beautifully.  Well worth your time.

B009Y61ZMI|5.0|I've liked this film a lot for many years, and was pleased to watch it streaming in HD.<br />Kurt Russell does an amazing acting job, particularly since he barely speaks.<br />It is a bit violent (hey, it's about a soldier) but it's also moving and fun.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|After the first movie came out I was disappointed and not sure about this sequel. Not the best but in my opinion very fun, also more realistic, than the over the top Joe from the first. Like most movies there is always over the top, the fight scene on the mountain is that part. I suggest waiting until it comes out on your Red Box near you or renting it here on Amazon.
0763644765|5.0|I've just begun reading this book to my daughter to introduce her to the idea of potty training.  We already have one Leslie Patricelli book, (&#34;Yummy Yucky&#34; to teach her what's okay to eat and what's not), which my daughter cannot get enough of, and this book is turning out to the be the same.  I highly recommend ANY of her books, based on the success of these two.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Okay, there really isn't too much to say. There's a lot of ways to make new friends while playing an old classic.
0553573403|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend who said it would be like Tolkien's adventures. However, since I have heard this comparison so often now, I maybe should start my praise by explaining why this book is TOTALLY DIFFERENT from anything J. R. R. Tolkien has ever written. In fact, the only thing Tolkien has in common with this are the presence of strong characters, a somewhat medieval setting, and that a vast and epic world is described. But these are pretty much hallmarks of much of the fantasy genre in general and can hardly be used to distinguish authors. Unlike \\"the Lord of the Rings\\", \\"The Hobbit\\", or \\"The Children of H&uacute;rin\\" for that matter, the world of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" depends much less on magic. Yes, the world that is described contained dragons long ago, but they are gone now. There is talk of giants, but nobody has ever seen them and they may be only rumours. There may be \\"The Others\\", but again it is unclear whether they really exist or still have any power and they are mostly referred to in curses, much the same way we would say \\"To hell with you\\" not knowing whether a hell actually exists. The main characters are all clearly human, look human, behave as humans, have human flaws and human strengths. Unlike in Tolkien's books there are no prominent wizards, hobbits, orks, elves, dwarfs, or demons dominating the story line. Secondly, the characters in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" are neither perfect heroes nor evil to the bone villains. Everybody has their understandable motives and behaves logically from their perspective, although, of course, the goals and ends of the various characters clash causing the wars and conflicts and intrigues to happen that make the book so captivating to read. Unlike Tolkien's adventures, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is not about the battle between good and evil, black and white, light and darkness. This makes the whole storyline appear enormously realistic, as the world here is so much more like our own. Also the language is totally different between Tolkien's stories and this book. Whereas Tolkien uses his beautiful poetic language, George R. R. Martin is extremely blunt. Some of the words he uses, I have never seen in a printed book, and if I were to repeat them here in this review, I am sure Amazon would be deleting my entire text. Also the description of cruelty, rape, and war is very graphic in this book. Again, this makes it much more a realistic book, as in our own world these things are (unfortunately) much more common than selfless knights singing poems to their beloved elven girlfriend. However, also \\"A Game of Thrones\\" plays extensively with language, even though in a very different, more subtle way than Tolkien did. For instance, the names of the characters are often slightly modified variants of existing names (Petyr instead of Peter, Catelyn instead of Catherine, Eddard instead of Edward etc.) and many terms that are used are either invented or ancient versions of existing words (mayhaps instead of perhaps, import instead of importance, turncloak instead of turncoat etc.). This gives the text an interesting effect, providing us with a warm familiarity with the world on the one hand (we often feel at home here), while at the same time we appear to be in a strange, different place. What I, personally, also like is the way how the story is told. The many chapters are rather short but always told from the perspective of a particular main character. Therefore, the reader understands their motives, understands what is driving them to do or not do whatever they are doing, understands why they love or hate or despise other characters and how this influences their actions. And because the perspective out of which the story is told constantly changes, there is no \\"absolute truth\\", no \\"right angle\\", no \\"good and evil\\"; only competing interests of all too human players. I will not mention details from the book as I do not want to spoil anyone's fun who has not read it yet. But I will say so much that George R. R. Martin has no problem killing off beloved characters. And unlike in Tolkien's books, dead characters do not come back to life (\\"Hello Gandalf\\"). Also this introduces a grim reality into the story. Playing the game of thrones can be deadly.<br /><br />To me this was the best fantasy story I have read in a long time. I have already started the second book (also great!) and there will be at least five more to come. Given the writing style and the type of story, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" reads much more like the historical novels from Bernard Cornwell than anything Tolkien has ever written. Which is not to say that Tolkien is not great. I love Tolkien's books (!) but they are very different and I feel the customer should know this before the purchase, particularly as this comparison is made again and again and again for reasons I do not understand. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes good fantasy with deep non-stereotypic characters, sad (sometimes really sad!) turns in the story, and a realistic (sometimes too realistic) world with all the cruelties of war, battle, and conquest. Amazon limits me to give a maximum of five stars. I would rather like to give six, seven, or hundred.that George R. R. Martin has no problem killing off beloved characters.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|First it is fun. Secondly it is surprisingly educational re MTG. To be fair (and balanced) sometimes it runs slowly and locks up my tablet.
B009AY04A8|3.0|The games not bad. Has descent graphics. However, the dialogue is way too long and takes too long to get to the next game. The words are corny and not interesting. Sometimes they talk like pirates and at other times they talk like modern yuppies. Still has a level of interest.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This is one of the most intriguing shows I've seen in a long time. Tatiana Maslany manages to play several characters in a way so it's not obvious they're all played by the same actress.  The plot is gripping and suspenseful. I can't wait for season 2.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|In the beginning Craig Johnson created Longmire, Absaroka County and placed the town of Durante there in which to dwell. This is my forth sojourn into the Longmire series and every time I read these books I find another jewel to treasure.  More on that later.  Initially I read these books out of order and enjoyed them as standalone mysteries.  However; when you read them for the rich history of Wyoming and the exquisite characters that walk, talk and breathe in the 24th county in the imaginary world that is Longmire you find an explosion of emotions, complex situations and lives to examine as the reader.<br /><br />One of the fun things about reading all of these books is Walt's wonderful sense of humor which is completely lost in the TV series.  In addition to reading all of the  Longmire books; I never tire of his well placed references to other books and other authors.  There are a number of references to Sherlock Holmes (...I tell you Lestrade...\\").  And in later books Walt references Dante's Inferno in all of its glory.  Read \\"Hell is Empty\\" for more on that. These I consider wonderful jewels because there are similar references sprinkled here and there for your enjoyment throughout all of his books.<br /><br />This is a very tense tale of love, hate, friendship and forgiveness that will make you laugh out loud one moment and break your heart the next.  This book lays the groundwork for the subsequent books in the series.  You meet Henry Standing Bear; Walt's lifelong friend, owner of the Red Pony and often referred to as \\"the Cheyenne Nation.\\"  Vonnie Hayes, is his first love interest since Martha died.  Lucian Connally, the former sheriff of Absaroka County, crusty old school and a bit of a pervert.  Jim Ferguson \\"the Ferg\\" who is Walt's part-time deputy.  Omar Rhoades is the picture of General George Armstrong Custer with long curly blonde hair only at least a head taller, handsome, tough as nails and rich; very rich.  Cady Longmire, is Walt's daughter.  Andthen there are Ruby, the dispatcher, Dorothy, owner of the Busy Bee, Deena, hmm have to ask Henry about her.  Let us not forget Vic, Walt's under sheriff (Craig could fill an entire tome on this gal).  And Lonnie Little Bird - he will find a soft place in the heart of the reader and Melissa; Lonnie's daughter will be there as well.  \\"Mm-hmm, yes, it is so.\\"<br /><br />These are characters that wind their way through the fabric of these books.  Oh yes there are more, many more, but you will just have to make the journey to Absaroka County yourself to meet them all.  This is truly a wonderful story and once you have finished reading The Cold Dish, you will be joining these wonderful rich characters on their next adventure.  You will be officially hooked.  Happy Trails!
B001QOGYFY|2.0|It's an okay detective yarn.  But it would have been more believable with a man playing the sheriff.  A tiny woman in the Antarctic playing Humphrey Bogart is just Hollywood garbage.<br /><br />Remember, any woman (in real life) in posts like that are for show only.  Because female sheriffs without their posse of men can not long endure.  The same holds true in the military.  Any woman in the military that's a sergeant major is a grandma and looks it.  Can you imagine a military with only women?  The day that happens we'll be invaded almost over night...and deserve it.<br /><br />Woman police?  Another joke.  Think they can chase down a man by themselves, catch him, subdue him and then finally handcuff'em.  Not gonna happen.  The guy will more than likely be shot--because they know they cannot match a man in hand-to-hand combat.  That's why there are so many people being shot by the police--thanks to the police women.<br /><br />Please understand; whenever a woman is allowed to join a group that is for very good reasons \\"men only,\\" the standards have to be changed--and they always go down--never up.  The weakest link is now even weaker.<br /><br />She, a mediocre actress, was miscast for this part; she has a pretty but common face that I see in the malls on a daily basis.  To make up for the lack of acting, they use her body--for example the unnecessary scene with her showering. What was the point of that?  Believe it or not, the movie actually begins with her going in and taking a shower.  Why?<br />Who, in their right mind, cares?<br /><br />Her voice is cold, bland and unmelodic. I wouldn't want to have to listen to that voice day-in and day-out. Where have all the good actresses gone?  All the good ones are either retired or resting in peace.<br /><br />Tom Skerrit was good; in fact, they should have reversed their roles. He should have played the aging sherrif thinking about retiring and she would have been more believable as the doctor.<br /><br />But, hey, I'm just your average Joe with a little common sense.
B009AY04A8|2.0|This game breaks the most basic rule of hidden object games; it counts every screen touch, including zooming and panning, as a missed attempt.<br /><br />Additionally, there is far too much dumb dialogue. No one reads it.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This was an eye opening look into the treatment of women in Afghanistan, and a gripping story.  Very sad but offers hope.
B008N5CGS8|4.0|i listen to it a lot in my car and it make the road go faster ;o)<br />just be carefull for tickets
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Overall, an interesting movie, but not necessarily one I will watch again.  Fairly similar to the Matrix, with some plot twists.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I well remember the first time I ever saw Peter pan...too long ago to say, but yes at the Cinema. The magic and thrill is still there. What an all time great
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I do not normally read books like this but I an glad that I did. It is completely depressing but has a cute story to it. I did not think I would cry that much. ;_;
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Action packed from the moment it starts. Willis at his best, go get it, sit back with the popcorn and enjoy
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|This movie isn't trying to win an Oscar.  What it is is an enjoyable, visually stunning movie that is well worth watching for a fun evening.
B005TBQS0Q|5.0|Words fail to describe this classic. Williams as his best, a movie, yep, but a great insight to the War
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A lot like missile command for Atari but touch controls are awesome for this game. Wish there was difficulty setting so you could ramp up the speed.
B00B4804KS|5.0|In 3d, a must to view. Prepare to jump out of your seat as this 3d version takes on a whole new look/.
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|Suits is a great show to catch up on when you're waiting for other stuff. The characters are likable, the writing is witty---but it's a little too mainstream to do anything really interesting in this golden age of TV. The plots are procedural and they pander a bit to the viewer to make them feel as smart as the characters---but it's all in good fun. By far, the reason to watch would be the fun interaction between the actors---that's golden.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game but the ads are so annoying!!!!!!!!! They interrupt my game so much!! Get rid of them seriously
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Excellent read. DK takes you through what he's learned over his career. I have a memory bias, but It's a non-stop good read.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a very fun app for me, I only follow like a handfull of people, but it is alot of fun to use. Very pleased.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Like playing for real  Could. A little quicker but fun... would b better if more online players were around. . . .
B00DP3IESY|3.0|The movie had plety of plot &#34;holes&#34; that defied logic, but it also had sufficient action and unexpected plot twists to hold my interest until the end.
0762451319|5.0|This is a must have for shadowhunter fans. The package includes a little bit of everything, a necklace, a small book, runes and magnets. The price is unbeatable. I'd recommend it!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This was a great follow-up to city of bones. It kept me on the edge of my seat. A great read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Got to play it, really hard to stop. The further you go the harder it gets. You need to think outside the box.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire's old charging cable was not working properly.  It just would not take a charge.  I received this and fixed my issue :)
B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't like the way this book kept moving from past to present every chapter.  It was annoying and made it difficult to stay focused on the storyline.  Can't understand why this was such a runaway bestseller.  Wasted my money.
0345536886|3.0|Started out great, good characters and humor. I was thrilled to read &#34;the old Grisham&#34;, midway it became ordinary. I guess, the excitement and thrills in The Firm are hard to recapture.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Fits my Britax b-ready stroller perfect!  Well made.  It has held up to constant summer use on all my strollers.
B008MEM24S|4.0|not a 5 star, cause it needs more to it. i polished off the levels really quickly. There are times I can not put it down, so i start it over.
B00D7JGL36|4.0|Great singer and steel player but the recording quality was a little suspect in places.  It seemed like the steel guitar was too loud behind some of the vocals.  This surprised me a little given the stature of the musicians involved.
B00164GDA0|5.0|This is one of my top 10 movies. i already loved it , before buying it. It just needed replaced. This story can make you think of your childhood and the times you had.

B00DLKXF3A|3.0|I would first like to state that I have been a huge fan of a7x since sounding the 7th trumpet. I absolutely loved waking the fallen and found that album was a masterpiece, not a song with a flaw.  City of Evil was very good and M shadows going to clean vocals was ok with me.  Self-titled was memorable but i noticed something was starting to slip.  Nightmare was the outcome Of Rev passing.  And Hail to the king was just......................  The whole album I noticed that the intensity just wasnt there,  usually synster and vengeance tear it up with the harmonizing guitars and all the song have intrigue parts that are left memorable.  But hail to the king fell into the same generic song structure. Synster did play some great solos and leads but nothing like Waking the fallen.  It is clear to me now that the Rev was the mastermind working with his BF syn on those songs.<br /><br />It pains me to review this album like this because a7x is a great band, but this album its just too generic compared to albums pass, and also what i expect of them.<br /><br />Also anyone remember pinkly smooth,  Syn should re-release their old band with Rev.
B000J10ER4|5.0|This was a great purchase, and I can find no fault with it.  It plays beautifully and has been viewed twice at home.
1572815108|5.0|These cards are beautiful and do help in decoding the message from beyond this realm. These cards act as a lure, visually and assist in the development of proficient reading.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Baraka is an absolutely beautiful film.  Content aside, there possibly isn't a better looking Blu-Ray.  The film was shot in the largely defunct 70mm Todd-AO format and restored and scanned at 8K resolution.  The picture is stunning.  The content will leave one feeling fragile yet connected to your planet and your fellow human beings.  You need this Blu-Ray in order to show off your home theater.  You need to watch this film to witness the way in which Ron Fricke both trivializes and glorifies human ritual, whether it be idiosyncratic or cultural, mundane or spectacular.
B00401ZA5U|3.0|Crocs makes great shoes but they seem to run a bit large. My daughter cannot even keep these on they are too big! I am hoping by next summer they fit her nicely. More like a kids size 1 than a 13

B005LAII80|5.0|Karl Urban is so badass as Judge Dredd.<br />Doesn't try to be some crazy plot twisting epic story about saving the world.<br />Love the fact that this is a simple story about a day in the life of Judge Dredd.<br />Hope they make a sequel.<br /><br />Both 3D and 2D are on one single Blu Ray disc.<br />Special Features are kinda short and wish that there was more stuff.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|as i read the events of auschwitz once more tears streamed down my cheeks. many a fiction i have read which had moved me earlier. but this real account shook me upl why cant there be prizes for such courage?<br />viltor's technique/system of logotherapy is truly an amazing concept but also so doable.<br />there are so many questions i would have loved to pose to viktor. i am sorry he is no more. may his soul rest in peace.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of the best games ever invented in plenty of people's opinions. You can build a world, mine, craft, and build what you want to build. Many people love this game and so do I. Even though it is only the pocket edition and the worlds are limited, it is still a great game for being mobile minecraft. If you want more of minecraft, get the real thing on the PC. You won't regrett that choice. But still, Minecraft Pocket edition is THE BEST GAME on the android market definatly. No matter what your friends say, this is the best game on the android market.
B00418NVMQ|3.0|i ordered 3 cds from them this one included a dvd to watch of the performance which i have not watched yet.  this was my least fav out of the 3, the other 2 were great!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a great game I love it. It is so fun. I think that I would play this instead of football.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This is an excellent show.  I was sad to see it off the air.  Now with the help of Amazon I am able to watching every episode and find things that I missed the first time.  This show is really well written and I do like the fact that it feels like the alternate universe does not feel like a gimmick.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I like it teaching me more language that I ever not that why I like the dictionary it is full of more words u don't know so that why I love the dictionary
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I did like this book a lot.  It was a quick read with a lot of information.  I did like that she was not preaching any particular religion and yet it was a spritual observation.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is a fun game and could be an interesting storyline but it is filled with chatter that is not necessary. Nice graphics.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really loved this book and would recommend it and have recommended it to several people.  I like that it was written by a scientist for a point of view of both the observer and the participant.  It gave me a lot to think about.
1451695195|5.0|I had seen Dr. Alexander being interviewed on various shows. To read his book only made it touch my heart more.<br />I have bought this book for several friends, most of whom are facing diffifcult times, as I am. &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;<br />This book, to me,confirms that there is a higher being for all of us.
B005HSL626|4.0|I love that you can get new swords, back grounds, etc. The game doesn't change much but somehow it still keeps you intrigued. Very fun. Could do without the advertisements after every level, but for free I can't complain.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Reading this novel by John Green has given me a palpable understanding of certain emotions that I've personally been wrestling throughout my teenage years. The embodiment of these ideas are now written down for the benefit of the world, in the form of a gripping and emotionally relatable story centered around the mere idea of loving another person, and how loving who they are is just much different, and altogether more difficult than loving the idea of what you want them to be.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Needs more updates, weapon changes, more options in game play. Its the same thing every time. Doesn't make me want to keep coming back
020530902X|5.0|In the spirit of the book, I invoke the rule that says &#34;omit needless words.&#34; Short, clear, concise, and useful book!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this game. I'm always eager to see if anyone has seen my drawing and sent one back. Definitely recommend.
B005R32L66|5.0|Skype is all I have. A globabl world contract with a number in the USA and one in Germany. Clients don't know where I am, when I pick up my phone, and this is exactly how I prefer it. Forwarding the calls to my different cell phones is not a problem, and usually I sit at my computer anyway.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is the best on television. I am so happy that the author and the director were able to collaborate on the story. I can not wait for the next season to see how the story continues to unfold.  How I wish I could have lived in that time.
B00AEFYGJW|4.0|If you try to take this movie too seriously you will probably walk away hating it.  If you take it for what it is, an action movie with a little bit of drama and comedy sprinkled in, then you can enjoy it.  It is definitely not the traditional summer blockbuster with an explosion every two seconds.  While there is a lot of action, there is a plot that the action does slow down for.  It is not what I would call an overly deep or complicated plot...your basic bad guys want to rule the world kind of thing, but there are aspects to it that involve more than just fighting or shooting.<br /><br />I think the pace of the movie was just right.  Clocking in at basically a little over an hour and a half, it did not try to do too much, and was able to keep the action going, tell the story that they were trying to tell, then got out before dragging on.  The movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.  There are a lot of special effects, but those do not really detract from the movie at all (like say Lucas' special effects laden movies).  The used enough sets and location shots that the effects really did enhance things.<br /><br />For those who get the discs and like bonus material, there is a lot here.  There are a bunch of behind the scenes features ranging from 5 min to 25 min.  Some are general \\"making of\\" features, others focus on the special effects, and other show the training regimen Angelina Jolie went through to become the character.  The fact that she did many of her own stunts in the movie was impressive given what they had her doing.<br /><br />Obviously liking or disliking any movie is subjective.  If you don't like action movies or Jolie, you probably will not like this.  I have not really played any of the games so I am not sure how faithful to the character they stayed, but it does seemed like they were trying to.  Maybe not storyline wise, but to capture the essence of the game. While it is not the best movie ever, on the whole I think it is well worth the priceif you still get the physical discs or worth a rental if you do not.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This felt like the Da Vinci Code just set in a different location and different histories.  The motivations of the villain felt forced, the character development was lacking, the mystery was not as enthralling as the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I'm not sure how I missed this one, I read a lot about writing.  First off, I bought this just a couple of hours ago and headed down to Starbucks to read in peace without the distractions of home, and wow, I sailed through this book in a couple hours and was very impressed.  That's why I was shocked I'd never come across it before, Amazon may be good at recommending stuff most of the time, but there are some disadvantages to the system, I can't put my finger on it, anyway, oddly enough, I came to this book via the authors blog, which I was lead to by some other blog....<br /><br />Such is the new world we live in. Connections.<br /><br />So, back to why you should buy and read this book if you are any type of creative person trying to pursue a life in an artistic endeavor.<br /><br />It's very insightful.<br />It's spot on about the problems we face when trying to actually create.<br />It's entertaining while doing the above.<br />It provides solutions.<br /><br />There are plenty of books about technique and \\"how to\\" and such, books like [[ASIN:0595144551 How To Become a Famous Artist and Still Paint Pictures]] and [[ASIN:068485743X The First Five Pages: A Writer's Guide To Staying Out of the Rejection Pile]] are a couple of examples of books I really liked, they give formulas, advice, how-to's and so forth.  [[ASIN:1582974578 Hooked: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One & Never Lets Them Go]] is another must read, as is [[ASIN:1439156816 On Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft]] and [[ASIN:1929834047 Paint the Sea in Oils Using Special Effects]] and many similar books about a certain artistic niche.<br /><br />Read books like the above, for sure.<br /><br />But this book was unique and different.  It really spoke to me, and I suspect it'll speak to you as well.  I was shocked to see how many reviews existed for a book on writing that I'd not come across before.<br /><br />Well, the timing must have been right.  Side bar, I'm an atheist and a secular materialist (working on launching a blog called paleoism in the near future) so I don't agree with some of the author's world views on spirituality, but that's okay, I am 100% on board for the thoughts behind, the reasons behind and actionable stuff behind where he's coming from.  I read the spiritual stuff a bit different, than say a non-materialist would, but I think the conclusions and outcome are the same.<br /><br />I say that because it's hard to deny this book came at the \\"right time\\"...<br /><br />As if I was looking for it.<br /><br />Or it was looking for me.<br /><br />In the book on painting I mentioned above \\"How To Become...\\" the author also talks about the Muse.  So it's real, I'm just not sure where she actually originates, but never mind, it doesn't matter.<br /><br />It's like trying to find out why we like puppies.  Doesn't matter, we just do.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope that if you've read this far you've been convinced to get this book.  I think you should, you're obviously at the right place, so assume the right timing and plunge.and a secular materialist (working on launching a blog called paleoism in the near future) so I don't agree with some of the author's world views on spirituality, but that's okay, I am 100% on board for the thoughts behind, the reasons behind and actionable stuff behind where he's coming from.

B00CX7TOOG|1.0|An American soldier who fought in the Serbian war (Robert De Niro) is tracked down by a Serbian victim of an American war crime and they re-enact the war in the woods outside De NIro's isolated cabin.  In the 1970's director Robert Aldrich could have made this movie in his sleep and it would have been a hundred times better.  Unfortunately, director Mark Steven Johnson is no Robert Aldrich although, to be fair, it doesn't help that both of his actors are so thoroughly miscast.  John Travolta pushes his fake eastern European accent hard to little effect and Robert De Niro appears at least 10 years too old to have been a field soldier in the 90's.  Both are clearly slumming, and the movie never generates much dramatic interest or suspense.  Fans of the stars might find this worth a look but everyone else should probably just stay away.
B000OLRH10|5.0|A must see, it has every piece of detail that makes this one of the best films out there.... I will watch this movie over and over again...
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Wish I had bought this long ago.  We had a cheaper product and our prints were just not coming out to be the same as what I saw on the monitor.  This was the trick!
0345803485|5.0|This trilogy was the best!!!  From the first chapter you are sucked in and immediately begin to love the characters.  It was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone.  Im sad it's over and cannot wait for EL James' next novel.

B00EE3FTNM|5.0|So far this is an intriguing mystery.  I have read that we will be shocked when we learn who the murderer is.  No idea yet, but we are enjoying trying to piece the clues together.  Very well done and in the tradition of the original Prime Suspect series, with clues building week by week. We can't wait for Wednesday nights!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It's really good and enjoyable!!!! I definitely recommend it for when you are bored or on the road and ETC.. even kid's can play this game
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Charming movie that made everyone laugh.  Not too much adult humor, but appealing to the whole family.  The plot was not overdone and Steve Carrell really brings his character to life.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Much better than we expected! Great visual effects, interesting plot and story line. MUCH sadder than we thought - especially for a Disney movie, but also with a happy-enough ending.

B0031R5K72|5.0|I finished \\"The Book Thief\\" a long time ago, but I kept postponing the review because, honestly, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to write. Has it ever happened to you to read a book and be so utterly stunned at the end that you first needed to stare into space for a couple of minutes to take it all in, and then found yourself incapable of explaining how, why... what had just happened? I can't say many books did this to me. I'm sure I can count them on the fingers of one hand, but \\"The Book Thief\\" sure did it for all the books out there.<br /><br />How do you even begin to review such a book? I can't say I loved it; it would be far from enough to explain how I really felt about it. I can't say I adored it, or that I'm going to recommend it to everyone I know (because I won't), or that it was the best thing I have ever read (I'm not sure it was). I sound confused, right? Well, let's see if I can explain.<br /><br />I'll never say that I loved or adored \\"The Book Thief\\" because the words that would help me define how this book made me feel have yet to be invented. When I started reading it I genuinely didn't know what to expect. Well, yes, I might have had some expectations because I knew I was about to read a bestseller that would be soon turned into a film, but still, I was quite innocent about it. After the first couple of pages I understood two things:<br /><br />1. It was not going to be a book that I'd recommend to many people.<br />2. I would probably read it for the writing style rather than for its story.<br /><br />Why not recommend it? Because the style is highly metaphorical and experimental; it is an entanglement of figures of speech, abstract ideas, dry humor, and preciousness that would normally make me cringe in a book. But not in this book. No, in \\"The Book Thief\\" precious writing works just fine. So fine, that I often felt compelled to draw out a notebook and note down entire quotes, or even paragraphs. But they don't make sense if you take them out of their context; they lose their magic. I guess they belong to the book thief alone.<br /><br />In my experience as a reader who has studied Comparative Literature for five years, I know that not everyone will enjoy this kind of writing. The book starts off slow, the narrator takes her time (I'm going to say \\"her\\" because the narrator is Death and \\"this\\" Death seemed very feminine to me), she builds up the story so slowly and smoothly, as if she had all the time in the world to tell it to the reader. Of course she does, she's Death. She talks about colors, about her job; when you finally think Liesel's story has picked up a bit and is going somewhere, Death makes an invasive comment just to remind you that she's there, in case you forgot. Reading some reviews of \\"The Book Thief\\" on Goodreads, I saw that many people found Death's seemingly random interventions annoying, and some complained that the story is a bit jumpy. No way am I going to complain about these devices. Actually, I'm not going to complain about anything. I found the writing style perfect, and I practically savored each and every word. When my friend (who had lent me the book) asked me what I thought about it, the first thing I said was: \\"This is real writing. I haven't read something like this in a long time and I'm just realizing how much I've missed it. Read it for the writing!\\"<br /><br />Now, maybe I should say that at some point I continued to read \\"The Book Thief\\" for the characters and the story, but the truth is that I have read this story one too many times in other novels dealing with World War II. I did read it for the characters because the author managed to make them so painfully real that there were times when I wished I had my own Max in the basement so I could properly take care of him, feed him and set him free because, God, did that poor boy suffer in the book. Why can't we just take characters out of their paper cages and give them the life they deserve?<br /><br />But, most of all,I continued to read \\"The Book Thief\\" for how much the second half of the book made me cry. Seriously, I was a complete mess. There were at least two scenes during which I cried so hard that I couldn't follow the lines anymore, and it got annoying because I just had to continue reading. But no, I had to take a break to rub my eyes and blow my nose. Pathetic... It's unbelievable what some books can do to us, mortals. And it's not like I didn't know what would happen, because if there's something that Death is not good at, that's building up suspense. No, she tells you what's going to happen pages ahead. Still, when I got to that point in the novel, I was still shocked and needed time to process the information. And now I get to another device that not many authors can pull off: ditching the mystery in favor of simply telling you how it's all going to end, and still being able to keep you hooked until the last word. About that last word... I was staring at it as if that could make more words appear on the page.<br /><br />Anyway, thank God I live alone, because if I still lived with my parents and any of them had walked into the room and saw the state I was in and asked me \\"What happened?\\"... I would've probably answered \\"What do you mean what happened? `The Book Thief' happened. This guy... this Zusak guy just made me cry so hard... I wanna marry him.\\"<br /><br />Bottom line: I'm going to re-read \\"The Book Thief\\" until I learn entire chunks of it by heart.I continued to read \\"The Book Thief\\" for how much the second half of the book made me cry.

B009AY04A8|4.0|Happy with this game. Story keeps your interest. Good variety of challenges and scenes. A little too easy to get penalty as bonds for wrong items selected but overall enjoyable game.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I have 4 rooms with 11/12.  Unless you play with friends who can send you collection items, you can't complete a room.  Also you Don't get a different item, but duplicates as opposed to Bingo Bash which gives you a different one each time and allows you to complete a room.  I will not ask perfect strangers to friend me just so I can obtain a collection item. That is the biggest downfall with this game.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This app was not what was advertised.<br />I was very disappointed with it. I would not recommend it to anyone.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing. The love August had for Hazel was true and genuine. This novel goes beyond children with cancer and tells a story about young love. The life of Augustus Waters will live on. The Fault in Our Stars is a must read.

B00DM0XXCM|4.0|A  good love story -- typical like Romeo/Juliet style but with a happy ending.  However I like the concept of the movie (two worlds, co-existing yet opposites of each other)... it's different and entertaining.  I enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I  absolutely love it.  I  watched all of Season 3  in just a  few days  because it was  THAT GOOD!!!!  Can't wait for Season 4.

B006RXQ2CY|3.0|Seems to me that history told us that The queen was more vicious than this movie portrayed her to be.  The drama in this movie was slow but goes to show you how a monarchy holds on to the money they live on.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Wow! I cant believe that I paid all that money and waited months and months between books to now find out that the trilogy is actually 5 freaking books! This book was a waste of time. I kept waiting for something to happen and all it was was filler. Sad to say it but I don't care how it ends and I am done. Shame on you Sylvia day!!!

B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I know a lot of fans don't like the fact that Khan was used in this picture but I don't mind it at all. I think it was a well made continuation of the first Star Trek Movie. Great a effects, maybe just a tad over the top.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Loved the third season of the Big Bang Theory.<br />The usual good comedy.<br />Just love this series every bit as good as the first and second series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I greatly much enjoyed this book. I strongly recommend it to readers who appreciate suspense in a very interesting alternate reality. I found it was well written, with multiple intertwined storylines. I'll definitely be reading the others in the series. Mr. Howey, you've got a new fan!

B005I7G3EM|4.0|If you like wild animals and seeing the different places in Africa, you'll like this movie.  Not an old John Wayne western but still a very good movie.

B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Wanted to use Google, but they refused to let me use my password, even though they approved my password when I got my kindle hd . Since you want take my e-mail I'm going to have to delete you app.
B00CE6E6B2|1.0|This game was straight out of the eighties.  I felt like I was playing old school Nintendo but without the fun.  If you are going to go with a Gameloft app this would not be the one to get.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|okay but need instructions to figure out by that time you lost the game a but too much work and too small
B000ID37T0|4.0|Al Pacino in a blind role continues his tradition of making a role come alive! A rough spot here and there with some of the other actors and occasionly dragging out a scene to long, but overall a recommended movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game.I wish u guys can make a another game.I also love the characters in this game.It also has the great places
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I liked the clearly laid out experiments. The true stories let you know these things are possible. I have already had success by using them. It's also fun. I recommend this book to everyone.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Not often do you see as many characters come to life as in this movie. Well done,solid story-line,great character development. The effects were/are amazing! And I always like Stan Lee's cameos;-) Can't wait for Nick Fury!!
B00ENFS0F0|1.0|Seriously?  One hundred and nineteen dollars for a six disc blu-ray set!?  In a world where the average person is struggling to pay bills, and on a show that talks of a balanced world where money doesn't exist, this looks like extortion!  Fifty-Nine is alot more reasonable and in line with previous releases and other shows of this calibre (i.e. Doctor Who).
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not so good for streaming video.  It's reliance on Wifi limits throughput and often times causes video to be choppy.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game, worth the 500 coins. Better than most games of its kind. Controls are good, plot good, story good.  Best game ever
B006S01GH2|5.0|This movie is just beautiful.  Sweet story.  Incredible cinematography.  Quirky, sweet music.  Darling.  When we first saw it in the theater my husband said he held out little hope for &#34;a chick flick in a language he doesn't speak&#34;, but he ended up loving it, too.  It will put a smile on your face.
B0041KVZ18|1.0|I have a copy of the original White Album but thought it might be nice to hear a new vinyl pressing....impressive packaging and sleeves but the record skipped(?). Upon further examination I realized the records (both) were warped, really? I have 40 year old albums in better shape. Do yourself a favor and but some vintage vinyl, it sounds great and will probably be in better shape when you put it on the turntable...newer is definitely not better in this case.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Really good drama. There is a new legal issue each episode along with the ongoing story of the relationships between the characters. Good Character development.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Even the original Alien came with great visuals. The sound quality was also great. I love the packaging<br />. and the nostalgia of the series.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Continuation of the ongoing story of the Floric Family. Continued interesting legal issues and development of the practice and conflist with the prosecutor's office.
0553801473|5.0|First things first, there are no spoilers for the fifth book in this review, only spoilers from past books.<br /><br />I do understand why some are frustrated by this book; it took forever to reach the shelves, and once it did, it kind of dragged a bit and added a bunch of characters while slowly guiding us towards the finish in this series.<br /><br />Full disclosure, I didn't have to wait very long for this book. In fact, I didn't wait at all...I only picked up reading the series after seeing the show, so I had all five books at my disposal right from the start. Perhaps that's why I'm not at all disappointed in this book, I honestly think it's the second best one yet (Storm of Swords is almost universally considered to be the best, and it's hard to argue it).<br /><br />The cons: It does drag on at times, and I was always frustrated seeing new characters have chapters when I was only concerned with the main story lines, but...<br /><br />The pros: Far outweigh the cons, those new characters all play pivotal roles and only serve to make things more interesting. After all, you've got to do something to make up for all those characters who were killed off in previous books. Eventually, what we're left with towards the end is the convergence of a handful of different storylines all gaining steam to meet as one in the final two books.<br /><br />These books are all long, and you need to be willing to stick through the story. Most people who have read through the whole series twice realize they missed so many interesting things the first time. I don't have the energy to read through the whole series again any time soon, but I loved GRRM's style of writing, the plot and honestly, who doesn't love reading a book knowing ANYTHING can happen going forward?<br /><br />Simply put: If you're reading through the series for the first time, and you enjoyed the first four books, you're going to love this book.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|A sweet, entertaining book with an obvious outcome. Liked it very much and would like more books like this. Thanks

B00CUKTG2Q|5.0|After four years we come to Franz Ferdinand's fourth record, one which we've seen promoted and advertised tirelessly on a variety of sites and in many publications. It's been nearly a decade since their self-titled debut broke onto the scene and \\"Take Me Out\\" dominated the airwaves. Like many bands who had a successful first album and hit single, they've been living under the weight of having to replicate that success and live up to big, and at times unfair, expectations. Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action isn't much of a leap forward but it's so fun that it's easy to forgive them for it.<br /><br />There are plenty of enjoyable tracks. First single \\"Love Illumination\\" is quite fun and feels like a throwback to their previous work, as does \\"Right Action\\" and \\"Evil Eye\\". \\"Bullet\\" is an appropriate title for a song driven by a chugging rhythm and earnest energy. \\"The Universe Expanded\\" finds a balance between soft and loud, fast and slow, melodic and experimental. It twists and turns enough to make it one of the album's most interesting tracks and one that demands several listens to really comprehend. \\"Brief Encounters\\" is serviceable, as is \\"Stand on the Horizon\\", all of which have moments of brilliance and require several listens to digest. \\"Fresh Strawberries\\" might just be my favorite cut on the album. It has a great groove and a sweet melody that elevates it to astonishing heights. The closer \\"Goodbye Lovers and Friends\\" isn't quite as memorable but the witty lyrics give it the extra push it needs to rise above the norm.<br /><br />In the end this record is certainly bright and upbeat, yet nothing new. Most of these tracks could be lifted from this record and placed on any previous Franz Ferdinand album and they would fit. Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is pleasant when taken for what it is and those who love the band will no doubt find what they're looking for. There's nothing really surprising or new here but Franz Ferdinand is so great at what they do that I can't fault them for sticking with a winning formula. This is one of my favorite albums of the year and one that gets better with every spin. Give it some time to sink in and don't be surprised if you find yourself dancing to it at unexpected moments. It happens to all of us.t they do that I can't fault them for sticking with a winning formula. This is one of my favorite albums of the year and one that gets better with every spin.

B008OM0EDO|3.0|It's a movie making fun of governments. Ironically, the final monologue is a sarcastic take on our current system which I found very entertaining. Enjoy it for what it is and you will like it. Don't go in expecting a Borat.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I also grew up under the illusion that gender equality had been achieved, only to barrel head first into biases that were detrimental both to my career, and my own self confidence.  Sheryl does a great job of putting those experiences in context, while providing both inspiration and practical tips to work to overcome them. Essential reading for confronting career biases whether you are a woman or a man.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Well written for a non academic audience.  I found the description of the evolution early Christianity and the dichotomy between the teachings of James (Jesus' brother) and Paul (self described 13th apostle) very informative.  It's an interesting take on how Christianity became 'Romanized' after the destruction of Jerusalem in the first century C.E.  Only wish I had the patience and inclination to explore the all the references noted at the end of the book.
B003477DVK|5.0|I really enjoyed this video &#34;My Dog Skip&#34;<br />the only thing I disliked about this video was it was not long enough.<br />it is a real good video to watch.<br />especially for kids.
0316228583|1.0|I so looked forward to reading this book... Bought it in soft cover to take to the beach.  I'm an avid reader, and generally read on Kindle, but wanted to hold this one in my hands.  What a disappointment.. The characters were predictable, the plot was slow to develop, and the book was too long.  Only because I always finish any book I begin, I read to the bitter end of this dismal and depressing failure.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I have first heard of piano guys through &#34;Chello Wars.&#34; I loved it and decided to check them out. I loved their music even though I am not a fan of classical music. One of my favorite songs is their remix of &#34;What Makes you Beautiful&#34; by One Direction, I am not even a fan of One Direction! Great artist and great music!
1427206465|5.0|Ishmael Beah is amazing. The life he was forced to live somehow producing the man he has become, defies logic. The fact that he both wrote and narrated this book illustrates that he is a budding scholar of the first order. An important book/CD most people should expose themselves to. Highly recommended.
1932100385|1.0|Before you buy this book, i suggest you watch the youtube video titled, \\"oiling america\\".  The speaker reveals the fraud this doctor was, in deleting the bulk of the data, which did not support his thesis.  according to the video, if it's credible, and it seems to be, this guy was a scandalous fraud.  The video rebuttal will be a disheartening revelation on the disgusting fraud that is the \\"China Study\\".
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is amazing.  A great way to carry any book with you without the bulk or having to keep up with multiple devices.

B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Not as I expected. Weird u think the newer the game the better. Asphalt 7 and 6 had better graphics. Volume to the car and shine now it's bland. Don't get me wrong.  It's $1 and I asphalt series let alone racing games with sport cars so if u don't mind a dollar it is worth it.<br />P.s it may crash, have a long previous load and not open so go to applications, all apps like on this one and clear cache. Hope this helped!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a nice knife for the price. It is built well and heavy. The only criticism is that you have to be determined to pull it out of the sheath. On the other hand, you don't want it falling out either. So, it is good at retaining the knife.<br /><br />I modified the sheath, cut off the nylon webbing, and added a Tek Lok, which is a popular mod for this sheath.

0156421178|5.0|Having recently visited Barcelona - this book gave me a lot of insight into the events of that era - which are seemingly erased from the local memory...nevertheless it allows you understand the differences in ideologies within the Republican side and shows the senseless nature of the decisions made because of them. Above all though it touches on the human nature of the war.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I never rate apps but I gotta get some coins wich is really special this game is addicting that's right yo
B0055S348W|5.0|recommend this to anyone... It finds all my printers and I print from my bedroom, living room anywhere.<br />I can print to my son's computer who lives in a different town when I am there.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Its an ok time killer but i wouldnt pay for it i got it as the free app of the day
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I purchased this because my work Macbook came with a Thunderbolt display, but the built-in charger on the display was for the older Macbooks. Now I can finally use my computer at my desk without having to bring my charger.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really good fun and cool. me and my brother play this game all the time.its a good game thats worthh it
B00271HAK8|5.0|My wife and I watched this with our 14 and 11 yr olds and they loved it. My daughter which is 14 yrs old says its her favorite movie. Its a great movie to sit down and watch with your kids; even after 27 yrs... Man, makes me feel old.
B007YLEM3Y|5.0|I love the D and getting their first album in such great condition was a plus! I Love this album!
B007MDB71O|5.0|Too bad this movie wasn't promoted more. I think a lot of people missed out on a great sci-fi movie.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Enjoyable as an old Poirot, Touch of Frost, or Inspector Morse.  David Tennant is a great actor and was what drew me to this show.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's a good strategy game. I like it a lot . It is a lot of fun. Have fun with it.
1439127727|5.0|This book is captivating, and I recommend it to anyone who loves history of our presidents. The research was superb, and the storytelling was outstanding.
0345529057|5.0|If you have seen the show and not read the books you should read the books they are just as good if not better
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Avengers is a great movie.  The scene well into the movie where all superheroes appear on the screen for the first time together is one of my favorite in all movies!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This could be one of the best movies ever made. Check it out and then go see the 2nd one. It's even better than this
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very fun. It will eat up all your time,but it might just be worth it. Gives you freedom to move and build whatever you want.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Poor interface and graphics, immediate remove.<br />They just want you to purchase in app. The sealed play is the worst implementation.
B006LSZECO|5.0|From beginning to end, this book held my interest.  The ending was certainly a surprise to me.  It is a must read book.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Hard to say that I was disappointed because I love Michael Connelly. I gave this book every chance.....kept reading even after I lost interest in every character....but never got to a point where I was the least bit &#34;hooked&#34;....Probably would not give this book a strong recommend,  but I will not throw Connelly under the bus for one less than stellar effort!
B008Y6YCB0|5.0|Simplicity is the best actress ever to catch my attention with this performance; the way she perform in this movie not other actress will ever equal her performance.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Direction, casting and story play is great I think. It shows how far a man can go when emotions are involved without boundaries and how people are influenced by it. Also brings out certain scientific facts in a interesting manner.. I like this show and would recommend it to anybody with flavor for adventure.
0345529057|5.0|I could not put these books down even though each one is nearly 1000 pages long.  The characters are well developed and really not very nice people at all.  It is hard to decide which one to dislike more.  I can't wait for the fifth book to come out in paperback.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|A great classic from a time past. Amazing how the author seemed to know this might come up in today's age of robots and such.
B005544V6A|5.0|It was fun getting acquainted with each character, as each one filled their role in the scheme of the show (law and life) to perfection. The writing is perfection.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|A few not-likely bits (or scenes) but it is a fantasy! Otherwise a well thought out story which was well written and well acted. Also well delivered.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Each character was perfectly portrayed showing how a law firm operates and the politics therein.  The public and private lives of each lawyer was woven into a captivating story for each episode.  I was sad when the series ended and was eager to get on to the next series.
0380973839|5.0|IMO, the world will grow dimmer because of his passing. His thinking is lost forever. While his story could take place anywhere, it didn't.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great dialogue...Great acting...captivating pace.<br />I loved every minute of watching each episode to see the light side and the dark side of the law.
B002E66C6E|5.0|A good movie, well acted and convincing. True to life expose of what it was like to be in that submarine. No spoilers here, gripping is all I can say.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It's great it's not a scam it says what it is and you probably don't know it but you can search I like to watch rooster teeth lucky 7dx Ventarian Tale sky does minecraft it's great so get it :) p.s best youtube app ever!
B0081KTI0E|3.0|Not a very well written story to me, it lacked depth, except for Daniel Radcliffe. Not one of my favorites. Otherwise it was well filmed and I had no problems with audio or video.
0316017930|1.0|If this was true only one race or one ethnicity will be successful.  But in every race and in every ethnicity there are successful people and there are people in every social scale.  I do not agree with his point of view, at all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a bit jealous of Howey's writing style. Very detailed while not bogging you down. Makes me feel as if I'm right there in the scenes, I felt the pain.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|It's a typical horror film. Worth watching when there isn't much on TV. That's when I go to Amazon the most :)
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|Really enjoyed how it was very entertaining to cover up the gore.<br />Sorry Nick Cage was lost but still really fun
B000002U9L|5.0|I love the movie, didn't realize they still made the soundtrack... We love listening to it in the car, even my 5 year old likes it
1401938906|1.0|This book was cheap, that was my initial justification for purchase. I got it during the \\"Two Year Anniversary\\" of the Book of the Day Deals (or whatever). One of the books I got, \\"Brain Rules,\\" by John Medina, which I cannot recommend enough, was an entertaining and extremely insightful look into how we learn and, oftentimes, why we best learn the ways we do. It is a fascinating look at learning from a physiological and evolutionary standpoint. THAT book uses science. THAT book teaches you methods to improve not just your learning but, ultimately, your productivity. Medina uses relevant anecdotes and accessible scientific data to illustrate why what he says is largely accepted. He NEVER has the audacity to claim that he holds all the answers and he NEVER abuses the word \\"proof.\\"<br />  So, E Squared...the whole book is littered with quotes that perhaps sometimes make sense contextually but are so obviously fluff that it detracts from the overall message they're supposedly attempting to bolster. If I have to stop every five seconds to read (and then ANALYZE)something somebody other than the author said I lose what it is that the author was trying to say. Sure I get the gist, but why include a quote and waste my time when what you said is most often sufficient enough to hold my attention. It almost seems as if Pam Grout didn't believe in her own thought enough or, more likely, anticipated that there would be any number of skeptics out there and felt the need to say, \\"See! Somebody more famous and smarter than me can be interpreted as agreeing with this thing I'm saying here now!\\" Over and over again. And it is here that we find the real problem.<br />  What Grout seems to be selling is misleading. \\"If you will it, so shall it be.\\" What I think she really ought to say is \\"If you can somehow twist it into something that you interpret as confirmation, then it's got to be that thing you were after.\\" I do not deny the ingenuity of the human mind, nor that her stories provide supposed evidence (read: coincidence) toward what she's claiming, but again, it's all smoke and mirrors. To borrow from Grout's own methods, I'll refer to Ed Burger, highly successful mathematician, \\"...if we have many opportunities to witness some rare event, then it is extremely likely that eventually we'll see it.\\" (Pulled from \\"Coincidences, Chaos, and All That Math Jazz,\\" another book that I strongly recommend). Burger is talking about coincidences. Given the almost infinite amount of possible outcomes any one of Grout's experiments can produce coupled with the highly variable definition of \\"unusual\\" each reader possesses, Burger's point, grounded in REAL MATH, appears to knock Pam's \\"proof\\" on its hind-end.<br />  This book is not exactly what I would call dangerous, but it is dishonest and misleading for a lot of people who haven't had the experiences or the will to see it for what it, and every other \\"self-help\\" book is. One reviewer mentioned \\"crying uncontrollably for half an hour\\" when the first experiment failed. Another questioned his/her faith in God. Of course, it was their own choice to read the thing.<br />  I'm not saying all self-help books are pointless wastes of money (I haven't read them all), but I will say this: if you truly want to improve yourself, buy a book like Medina's. Become a smarter, more resourceful person. That ought to save you some money for real.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Ignore the reviews here from know-it-alls who claim this'd book's strategies are obvious - if they were, why haven't the reviews managed to create best sellers of their own? This book is excellent for those marketing on a small budget as it shows you how to compete with the big publishing houses using techniques they don't have access to. The author's journey is inspiring, and he shows you through it step by step how to achieve what he achieved. I can't wait to get started marketing my book!
B002ZG976U|4.0|Actually, the story is pretty predictable, but the music and dancing are worth watching over and over again! Christina SIZZLES, and Cher is STILL great!
B0091WNK8M|3.0|Okay for the kids.<br />Doesn't much benefit from HD.<br />Appropriately &#34;G&#34; Rating.<br />Pro:  On kids level.<br />Con:  Teaches disrespect for authority.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This app makes it very convenient to search Amazon for great bargains and deals. I rarely buy anything without checking here first!
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Got slow but I stuck with it as the actors were legendary. Wouldn't watch it again though. The story is sad and scary.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This has become one of my FAVORITE soundtracks.  Christina & Cher have such wonderful voices. Christina is so versatile. If you liked the movie, you'll find yourself thinking of it during the songs.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Funny, sad, interesting, with an amazing twist. Plus a great cast of actors that make their story believable. Lots of fun!
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|I liked it, all I ask out of a movie it that entertains me. Give me a story that is believeable, give me effects that I can believe, give me characters that are real, give me a movie that I haven't figured out the ending half way through the story. This movie met all my requirements.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|The activities in this game are fun and challenging and I enjoyed playing it. However, I would not recommend it because the graphic interaction is poor.  In many cases I had to wait for a very long time for the click.  Luckily I got the link to the Walk Through to reassure myself that I was doing the task correctly and needed to allow more time.  There weren't any clues for the yarn/circuit puzzles which I found confusing.  Don't attempt this game without the Walk Through.
B00338CMTI|5.0|Only read up to chapter 8, but very well written story thus far cant wait until the movie opens in Nov.
0743270754|5.0|I was glued to this book and surprised myself for liking it so much.  There were parts that I skimmed over (this was a big read) and it took 100 or so pages to get into it but after that I could not put it down.  I even traveled to New York and went through<br />Seward's house.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|This movie was lame and gross with very little effort put into character development.  Lots of green screen and slow motion but storyline was lame.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This has to be the Best scifi thriller series since the xfiles. You can't be a true geek without watching this series.
B008YU7IGW|5.0|Very informative, encouraging and enlightening. Printing the affirmations and posting around my house and desk at work. Glad I bought the book.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|By now, everyone knows the \\"big reveal\\" of this movie.  As far as that goes, it was well imagined and thoughtfully plotted for a new era.  Other than that, however, this is a basic retelling of Star Trek II with a few new twists thrown in for good measure.  We get a solid look at a Klingon world and what to (possibly) expect in the next installment. The performances were sound, though sometimes it really feels like the actors are \\"playing\\" their characters and not letting the essence of each personality come through naturally (except for Saldana who recreates Uhura perfectly). The nods to the old series were fun to watch and I expect more Tribbles in the future. Four stars for this go around.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|One of Sean Penn's best.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I wish it was really free and I could play as much as I want. But I love the game.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie, even with all it's crass & rudeness. Is one of Mark's best. &#34;Ted&#34; had me rolling. I laughed really hard.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Bought this app because we needed an alarm clock on a recent trip and thought we would use the kindle.  Works great, lets you put in as many alarm settings as you want.  I needed meds reminder and just set it around the clock.  Lets you have music as the alarm and slowly rises in volume instead of jolting you awake.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I love it because it is way much simpler than the WeatherChannel app. It doesn't have the same amount of useless information than the other app. You can also switch from ºF to ºC, which is very important (only the US and the UK use this weird kind of measure...)
0823016714|5.0|I just received this book today, and just looked through it. I love it! Of course it covers a good range of facial expressions, by men and women of different ages and ethnicity, which is the sole reason I made this purchase. But a bonus! In the back, it covers different kisses, hats and headgear AND phonemes! Phonemes are the visual representation of sounds made by the mouth. Like cartoonists matching up mouth movements with script. If you're trying to draw cartoons, comics, etc, this is EXTREMELY helpful!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This third year is even better than the previous ones.  Makes for delightful watching.  Wish there were more like it.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I love everything about this book! it inspires me every day to be a better person! Highly recommended to anyone looking to better themselves!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really like the pictures and the quests in this game. It's a lot  of fun and is very pretty to . Look at while playing
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Have all the die hard series and this one is just as good as the others. Am a great Bruce Willis fan.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book, I just couldn't put it down. There really aren't any slow parts its just increadible. And the end just through me for a loop. I look forward to reading more of Orson Scott Card!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|we want candy crush  WE WANT CANDY CRUSH!!!! NOW ALREADY OR IM DONE WITH KINDLE AND AMAZON!!!! my phone broke and both my laptops took a s*** i only have my kindle left and im having withdraws im on level 138 OMG AAAASHHHHHH!!!!!!$
B009ME47H2|4.0|Great for college class recordimg which is what i use it for. I have headphones which have a built in microphone and it recorded with exceptional quality. My professor mumbles sometimes and I still understood every word. Recorded audio can be played back within the player. The only problem is with this feature, if you play back and exit the player you cannot stop the track. If you r&eacute;-enter the player and hit pause it will start palaying your track over what you're already palaying and you cannot stop the initial track. Sucks when they're an hour and twenty minutes long as they are in my case. Other than that, great app.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We are Downton Abbey fans. My family & I are looking forward to Season Four, January 2014 can't come too soon :-/
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Incredible how 40 years improves one's taste.  I have no sense memory of having loathed Self Portrait when released, but I know I did.  It sounds magnificent to me now.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I love the music, and I like that there was actually acting in this 25th Anniversary Edition vs the 10th Anniversary Edition, where the actors just stood on stage and sang their parts.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it!  I have played this on several devices and it is always a fun challenge.  Love to play it.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I liked the continuation of the Phantom of the Opera, however, I did not enjoy it nearly as much as the original movie. However, I'm happy to haves copy of both DVDs.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great story. Great acting. Creepy, sleepy little town. I have 5 more episodes to go, and I love, love, love it!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Totally enjoyed the two twists at the end.  Made me think about attitudes in my own daily life.  Some nights I just didn't want to put it down.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Funny, sweet, quirky, unexpected. You'll laugh out loud in &#34;Crazy, Stupid Love.&#34; I highly recommend the movie to anyone who loves Steve Carell or movies like &#34;Date Night.&#34; Awesome movie.
B000A0K2JO|1.0|I was trying to use this to convert a USB keyboard to PS/2 because our company has disabled the USB ports on our computers to prevent key logging.  It did not work when the keyboard was plugged into this adapter.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I grew up on Star Wars and this is a great compilation filled with some new, digital stuff but so what.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|It was a takeoff of the Wrath of Khan with an interesting twist on who died. other than that is was real good.
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|First off, they barely make any noise, and there is no flexibility to get them on my sons feet.  Cute idea, poor product.  I should have gone with the wrist rattles.  I won't buy Lamaze next time though!
B009AY04A8|5.0|one of the best hidden objects games I have played. well written with a story line. I would recommend it.
B00CA4S3UI|5.0|Melodic Metal mastery from Magnus here. Not a single bad note on this album.<br /><br />Shredding guitars, awesome hooks and a collection of the best singers in this genre. This a no brainer.<br /><br />Go buy this album so Magnus will make more solo albums.
B000FC0V3E|1.0|Book was dry, and offensive.  Was uncomfortable reading it, and wish I had known it was anti-semetic before I had purchased the book.
B005QYKD4I|2.0|The special effects are mostly good. The storyline is bad. I want my 2 hours back. This review needs four more words.
B0063IH60K|3.0|you get an ad between every new game, some are easier to clear than others.  other than that all is good.
1400069289|1.0|I picked this one up with high expectations. I couldn't wait to read this book and once started, I couldn't wait to get rid of it. It is frustrating to scrape through endless anecdotes without getting to the point. There is little information about the science of habit and too much information about everything else. I felt frustrated - which is not quite common and called it quits. I don't recommend this book at all. Don't waste your money, expectations and your time on this one.
1419705644|5.0|I'm actually rating this book for my daughter. She loved it and wanted me to rate it 5 stars. She really enjoyed reading it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this series of books.  It moves well and keeps you wondering what is next.  It's easy to visualize the world Martin has built.  I wouldn't say he is the new Tolkien though.  Martin's story is way more raunchy.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book is written in the first person and I didn't really like that. The story line is just ok, nothing special. Most of John Grisham's books keep me reading until I'm done, but this one was difficult to return to after a break. Couldn't wait to be finished with it.
0307155102|5.0|I love this book!  I had a copy when i was young and spent hours looking at it and reading it!
193700788X|2.0|I found this book disappointing not just because of the ending, which seemed to come with no buildup or logic, but because the storyline didn't make a lot of sense. It felt like the author simply got tired of writing the series, threw in all the random characters from the series, and called it a day. It isn't even told all from Sookie's perspective as it usually is.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />After reading about how Eric and Sookie have so much love and passion for many books it seems implausible that they aren't able to reconcile and end up together. The Eric that readers have grown to love doesn't seem like a character who would give up Sookie just for money and power, or one who would give up control over his own &#34;life&#34; so willingly. It's also unbelievable that Sookie would not be more upset.<br /><br />Even if you agree with her ending up with Sam there isn't a logical buildup to this turn of events. After so many books of reiterating that she only thinks of him as a friend she suddenly changes her mind in the last 50 pages? Also, did we really need to revisit every character from the series? Overall, this is only rewarding in the sense that after 13 books you may have a curiosity about how it all ends. Personally I'm hoping that the show True Blood will eventually come up with a more satisfying ending.
0618164413|5.0|I love this series of stories!  The Complete Adventures of Curious George is a great compilation and a perfect gift!
1401322336|5.0|I love this book. It is so easy to follow and the recipes turn out yummy. I will be buying more of his cook books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun challenge.  You feel accomplished and compelled to complete each level.  It is hard to stop. A good way to pass the time while you wait....
B005LAIHPY|5.0|i had pretty low expectations with this one but it actually surprised me.  thoroughly entertaining.  hope you like it too.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been using this to stream youtube or other videos to my tv while i work on my laptop, its fairly simple to set up, had a minor issue with my wifi but that was quickly resolved and has been rock solid since
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app for pinterest. Way better than pinhog. You can browse, follow, create pins, create boards. Whatever you want to do.
B001EBWIRW|3.0|This is mainly my fault for not reading the fine print.  My daughter is obsessed with this movie however she is younger and likes happy endings.  This one is the director's cut where the plant takes over the world.  I had to shut it off at the end!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I could not set the Kindle Fire down to go do something else.  I wanted to go from one episode to the next.  Planned to hold off on Season 3 until closer to January.  But since I was addicted it could not wait.  Thank you so much for offering it on Kindle.  I dearly love this series and hope it continues for many years.  Again, thank you for offering it for Kindle Fire and also on PRIME.
0876855583|5.0|I read Bukowski when I was a teenager and thought it was interesting then but admittedly only understood half.<br />Read him again in my mid-thirties and haven't stopped since. They're all really good but this is by far his best book. Very touching, very personal, very sad.
0452273331|5.0|Simply put, this book has an amazing set of characters, each representing a different aspect of Ayn Rands philosophical views.  Regardless of your views on objectivism, or Ayn Rand as a philosopher, any true fan of literature can appreciate the brilliant syntax and absolutely beautiful character development throughout the story.  The chapters weave from person to person, and you are able to feel how they grow and change (or refuse to change) throughout the story.  One of my favorite all time stories, and such a powerful message of committing to your craft, regardless of what others may think.  A definite read for those who enjoy depth and powerful allegory
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Using Google, I can find everything I've ever looked for easily.  An easy way to find all the information on whatever subject I am searching for.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Images are easy sometimes and sometimes hard.  They are imaginative and fun. You will be entertained endlessly with this app  and hopefully playing this will encourage kids to spell correctly.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game you have to get it if you do make sure you save your pearls other than that just have fun
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I really like star girl you get to meet friends ,shop and a lot more I love star girl!!!! : )
B000002GXJ|4.0|Given that we're all getting older, some of us may never see the Eagles live again.  But, we can savor the feeling with this CD of live performances.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|I never saw this movie as a kid, but was recommended highly by friends. They liked it very much, laughed throughout. It was kind of amazing that it kept the attention of all 3 kids, considering their span in ages (14, 12, and 7). Recommend.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|There are some amazing songs on this CD, and Waiting in the Weeds is one-of-a-kind. Timothy B. Schmit is in especially fine form.  Glen Frye rocks out beautifully on How Long, but then there are those ballads of his.  IMO, not a good match with his voice, I skip over them.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I play Minion Rush on a Kindle Fire, not the HD model.<br /><br />Minion Rush is great looking, great sounding, has pretty simple fun game play, and is generally very fun.<br /><br />There are a few downsides.<br /><br />First, it requires some significant post-installation downloads.  So this isn't a game to install and then take on an airplane... or if you have a non-phone tablet, even to take away from WiFi initially.  You can play it offline, but first you must play it online.<br /><br />Second, at least on my Fire, the controls aren't quite as quick as the game needs them to be.  Buttons would work better. This is probably more a problem with the Fire than with the game, and doesn't ruin it, but does add to the frustration.<br /><br />And last, the in-app purchases (money for certain kinds of credits which buy tokens which let you revive, etc.) are not as optional as you might hope.  Although they aren't mandatory.<br /><br />But the game is great fun and true to Despicable Me's style and humor.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|Pigs will blow you away. So will Dogs. Sheep is a complete assault on your senses. Pink may not be well because of Animals. Buy this album right now, and become a Floydian. For you who are already Floyd, please forgive me for trying to say something without taking acid first.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|If you read while the kindle is being charged, over time the white coating cracks coating on the point below where the cable is inserted into the kindle.  The cable/wire bends and cracks and, eventually the wires break and the charger fails to charge the kindle.  I believe my recent purchse was the third or fourth one I have purchased over the years.  It needs to be as thick as a cellphone.cable, and still have the longer wire than a cellphone cable has.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|I do not know what to say about The Wall. I was right there when it blew Thriller away. I think The Wall is an act of genius. Who knows how things like that happen? It is as troubling as The Dark Side of the Moon, The White Album, Hendrix, or the 9th. (I hope God does not smite me for comparing anything to the 9th.)
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Great movie. Who doesn't love Ferris Bueller's Day off? It is a classic. What else is there to say? Blah
B000001ESF|5.0|My best memory of 2112 was when it first came out, and me and my best friend took the bar ditch at 120 to pass the high school football bus. I had a pretty good Alpine system with ADS speakers, and you could hear it a mile away. We made some 2112 believers that day. Never mind the cloud of blue smoke from my car and the engine fire.

B007BLDFWG|4.0|Elizabeth Olsen makes a fine debut in this slow-moving, somber-mooded film about a confused, depressed college girl who runs away after her mother's death and finds herself joining a communal cult that becomes more and more Manson Familyish as the film proceeds. MMMM makes very effective transitions between the back-story, set during \\"Marcy May\\"'s cult days, and the front-story, set after \\"Martha\\" has escaped the cult and is living with her sister (and only surviving immediate family member) and her sister's new husband. Some interesting juxtapositions are drawn between Martha's sister and brother-in-law with certain members of the cult. The most obvious theme of the film is Martha's attempt to readjust to the reality of \\"normal, respectable\\" existence, but there's much more here. While MMMM makes no attempt to make communal cult-life seem appealing, it also quietly and subtly calls into question the frequent hypocrisy of \\"acceptable\\" lifestyles. There are some very definite, smartly done layers to this film, and the amount of empathy we attain with the lead character is effortlessly acute.<br /><br />MMMM's biggest downside is simply that not all that much happens, at least insofar as traditional dramatic action is concerned. Some surprising stuff occurs toward the end, but the drop-into-space ending will leave many wanting to know what happens next. At the same time, however, it leaves room to speculate on just how important what-happens-next really is.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I stumbled upon this new series and I cannot stop watching.  The characters are engaging and the story lines for each episode builds the overall plot and theme.  Love it so far.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This book is an uplifting and delightful  story of a man and his cat.  A remarkable tale of the renewing of a life with the help of a cat named  Bob.<br />The only negative I can think of is that it was too short!  I just didn't want it to end.  I  recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about pets and their owners, as well as anyone who wants to just feel good when they are finished reading.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Lots of surprises in this season. No one is safe. Michelle Dockerty is perfection.  Can't wait for the roaring 20's next season.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I could barely turn a page. Nothing about it was interesting! I fell asleep numerous times reading it. I am definitely not into this style of books..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am a big fan of puzzle games, and I really like this one. The easy levels are very easy, but most of the hard levels require a bit of thought to complete properly. And a few of them are fairly challenging, at least for me!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Very strong character portrayal. Great cinematography . Really feels as if you are part of the time period. Very UK.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun version of the classic Missile Command and its variants. It starts out really easy but quickly gets to a reasonable level of challenge without being obnoxiously hard. The system for repairing and upgrading is pretty good too. I was concerned I would blow through all of my credits in a short time and be stuck, but I managed to keep going for a while.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I enjoyed the book for the most part, but when I was finished, I was frustrated because it certainly left quite a few basic questions unanswered.  For example, how exactly was the sickness/plague started or who created it?  Where are the North Koreans?  Are they all dead or living underground or what?  The &#34;narrator&#34; brings it up, but just leaves us hanging.  Oh, there may be a few brief guesses mentioned in passing to all these questions, but that's it.  Don't get me wrong, I did like the book, I just wish there would have been a little more backstory included, and answers to questions brought up by the book's characters.  If it drives you nuts to end a book without having all the questions answered, then this book may not be for you, but if you're just looking for a good escape from reality for awhile, it's not bad.
B0081336FO|5.0|I was never attracted to the Basil Rathbone movies but the new generation Holmeses are converting me.<br /><br />One of my teenage sons goes on tears when a new show is recommended by someone whose opinion he values.<br /><br />Thus he watched all of the Sherlocks in a very short burst of time.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by it all.<br /><br />The writing and acting were top notch.
0345347951|2.0|Love A.C.Clark! Just not this particular novel. I found the characters a bit flat. I did enjoy the plot twist [spoiler!] of having the alien look like a red-skinned devil.
0205313426|5.0|The manual that will put  you on the right  track/ Especially if yiu are a new writer  who is trying<br />to decide the best way to tell your audience your thoughts. I recommended it<br />to my grand daughter.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|Love the book.  Wish I had read it before I saw the movie.  I highly recommend you read this first.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|I was informed this was the best vampire movie ever made. I am finding it rather slow, but it does have it's moments.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun game. Just wish you could get things done without using real $$. I do enjoy playing but had to start over when my game froze after I spent real $$ which I now lost....
B004LWZW42|5.0|I can watch this movie every 6 months or so, and never get tired of it.  It's just hat good. I'm into sci-fi movies.  Fanctastic special effects, good story line/plot.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this book it's awesome I love it a lot and more people should read it. And that is my interview.
B005T87QCI|4.0|I like the game, but am having a hard time playing it on my Kindle. Wanted to see how it was going to play.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|worked great right off the bat, no problems with wireless printer which is an HP printer.  Great app for the kindle fire
B004PKOKSO|5.0|This is an excellent example of mature Scofield in a reflective mood.  I'm listening to it a lot.  Check it out.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like google more than any other search engine and use it all the time, bing search isn't what it put to be.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|...I did.  In fact, I actually loved it!  There was 3 things that made me change my mind.  1.) My brother, who liked it so much, he bought it.  2.) My baby sister, who fell in love with it and bragged to me about it.  3.) My co-worker, who didn't feel for Timberlake, until her husband came home with it, then, she fell in love with it.  I fought the feeling, until my brother gave it to me as a birthday gift.  So, I popped it in, and it grabbed me.  I read the liner notes and saw where Timothy Mosley, aka Timbaland, wrote a bunch of the songs and produced it.  I told myself that this was going to be a disc of head-bopping music, but after listening, it had a smoother groove to it.  It's on that sexy tip that I wasn't expecting at all.  So, when all is said and done, I give this recording 5 stars, cause he did that thang, and he did it well.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|So sorry to hear all the cry babies given this 1 star & only doing so 'cause God forbid they have to get up & flip the movie 1/2 way through.  How bad the DVD was.  How 1 * it was.  Lazy.  Instead of utilizing the time as a bathroom or refill/get popcorn break, they all stick to the negative.  Crying their rivers...<br />Tough!  Just like the movie TOUGH!  Excellent all the way around.  They could've thrown in Pacino or Nicholson.  However, it was outstanding without them.  Right up there with Rainman, Ghost & Dark Knight!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Waited anxiously for this book to come out. Thoroughly enjoyed it but could not believe there was going to be another book to finish the series. Not that I mind, Sylvia Day kept me interested in what really happens to these characters. For all of the people who see these books as just a Fifty Shades knock-off, just stop! Sylvia Day puts into words what many women fantasize about: an overwhelming and sexy as hell love that sweeps you off your feet.
0143039431|4.0|The quality was really good as it had been listed. Received it on time as well, which was nice. Have not started it though, so can not say anything about the book.
B00640UICA|5.0|got it for free in the free-app-a-day deal and really like it. Good time pass, cool graphics and those creatures are so cute ...<br />thumbs up from me :)
0385486804|3.0|When I bought the book online, it said the book was in a great quality, but when it arrived, there was many wrinkles, huge noticeable wrinkles. It is still legible, but the condition was just bad.
B0044WUQ3G|2.0|This movie is as scary as watching paint dry!  I am terrified of heights and this movie just didn't convey the feeling of height at all.
0060899220|5.0|Bourdain at his snarky best. This is more in keeping with his earlier years on TV -very sarcastic and not made for prime time.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|The simplicity and depth of the seven laws outlined by Deepak Chopra are a beam of light in a world that often choses darkness. In language that is simple and poignant, he catches your attention from beginning to end. Happy reading!
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Saw the show twice, it was excellent.<br /><br />My question is that the European version is a CD/DVD combo, why isnt the sam ebeing released in the states?<br /><br />Anyone know?
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Cool game no bonus levels but still good graphics and story line. I'd buy the follow up game...if I knew what it was called
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel years ago and was instantly absorbed... it was definitely one of my favorite book of the year and since then I have re-read it many times and it holds up well and remains one of my favorite books.  Dark, powerful, with interesting, complex characters and an intriguing world, definitely two thumbs up.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This game is pretty good, but I prefer to see real monkeys box. I hear they do some mean uppercuts. This is the next best thing!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Way better than candy crush but just as addictive! I couldn't stop with just one level and stayed up way too late.<br />Love this game and can't wait for more levels!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|This app doesnt have loud enough tones  to work for me, I am a sound sleeper once slept through a tornado
B00BEEKN26|5.0|Loved the mystery and murder series.  Suspense was great! David Tennant dons a more serious role [seen him in Casanova and Dr, Who series].
B0027CNFR4|3.0|It's just not as good. The original is more classic - doesn't need explanation. This version requires knowing the back story. And story is not as good.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like evernote's ability to make it easy for me to share info between my devices. However it would be nice if it also served as a to do list or even a calendar with the ability to add things to a schedule and remind me on all devices when something was coming up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Oh, how I resisted watching this....my sister kept telling me how good it was, and usually, over decades of experience, I've learned to ignore her recommendations with good reason.  Downton Abbey has forced me to re-evaluate that knee-jerk response, at least this time.<br /><br />Nothing about this show does not please, satisfy and gratify the viewing experience.  I have to say I am glad I waited until 3 seasons were available, as I am a marathon viewer (LOST in 2 months, etc)....only downside is having to wait now for season 4, and decide if I can handle a once-a-week experience versus obsessive single-sitting through multiple episodes.  But, that's a decision for a few months down the road.<br /><br />Love me a good series, and now they all are compared thusly:  &#34;Good, but no Downton Abbey&#34;.  Best. Thing. Ever.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. Wouldn't want to pay for it at a movie theater but that's why I love Amazon.com's movie site.
B00A4B9A1U|5.0|Most insightful book I can remember reading in a long time. I could not put it down...but some how I did.
