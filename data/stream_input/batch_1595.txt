B005LAIHHC|5.0|If you like immature, over the top, purposely offensive jokes, then here you go!  Cohen is the greatest comedic actor of this generation and this movie is amazing.
1466401885|5.0|Best book I have read in a while!!! Can't wait till the second book is out! I will definetly purchase this again off amazing
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An excellent read in which each book in the series just gets better and better. Don't hesitate to purchase this volume - just buy it - you won't regret it. I can't wait to explore some of the author's other books, and I'm desperately hoping he'll continue this story into many more books.
1612183956|5.0|I can't believe the bad reviews this book has received.  I have read Mr. Crouch before so I took a chance.  You MUST enjoy this type of genre......think \\"Twilight Zone\\".  I finished it within 24 hours.  Was difficult to put down.  It's an enjoyable ride!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because there is always a new game to play.  This app packs loads of fun into simple games.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is the app that should be included on all devices.  Its so nice to see how much battery life you have for different applications such as reading, video streaming, apps, etc.  Very accurate!
0345803493|5.0|Luv, luv luv these books! I didn't know what they were about, but everyone was talking about them so I thought I would give it a try... I read book one in 24 hours, and book 2 just as fast...can't wait for the third to arrive on monday!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|writing is not great in this book.  If you are an avid reader the writing style will be a big disappointment.  I read this book because of all the hype and I am struggling to get through the second book.  I keep thinking it has to get better but sadly it doesn't.  I would not read this author again.  No plot and terrible writing makes me wonder how this author got published in the first place and how i got suckered into the hype???  I should know better!!!!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This movie was uplifting and fun to watch.  It is a love story but my husband also liked it. One could only wish international relations could go so smoothly.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I really wanted to like this App - but, it is clunky and not very user friendly. My Iphone weather app works much better.  On my tablet, I've tried several others that are simply easier to use. Because it is free, you should try it out and see for yourself. But, be aware, if you download the app from Amazon you are stuck with it like I am. I suggest you go elsewhere to get the app to try it out. This is true, last time I checked, for all of their apps. I have apps stuck on it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is one of those games you can't stop playing. It's so easy to play. You just touch the card and it moves for you making it so easy to play fast games.
034580404X|5.0|I haven't read novels in a long time until I picked up these books!<br />I thought the story line was great...I wasn't so much into the sexual<br />content, but instead held these books as very interesting!  I also got<br />to know the characters and will miss them!  Good books!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is really fun. you can hunt and fish and much more. you'll like this game. I'm 9. it's. teaching me to make wise purchases. you can use dynamite to get prizes daily.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|This was a fantastic deal. Not only did I get the whole thing for super cheap but now I can listen to the songs straight from my computer with no interruptions. Great for mix cds :)
B006LSZECO|3.0|With 1600+ reviews... I just wanted to note... that this book had me hooked up until the last 20%... and then it became drawn out with no clear end in site.<br /><br />What I loved about this book was that it was written as a GENERATION X'er... and the trial, and tribulations of our generation (dotcom bust, housing bust, unemployment, burst of the US dreams).  This was refreshing to me, albeit a wee-bit cynical.  The turns and twists in this novel are great, the planning and forethough.. and look into each others minds.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of this book which was very good.
0345803485|1.0|I could not believe this book would be a best seller or a best romantic. My sister had me read the book saying how good it is, and I made the mistake of reading it. It is so poorly written and anyone with a decent education would not find this book entertaining or intriguing. I agree with the other bad reviews about this book. I just wish I would have read them first, I could have spent the reading a book I would have actually enjoyed or felt full filled reading. I feel the need to write a review to get the review ratings down on thus book. It really is sad that people can think that this is a good book.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I really enjoyed this album.  Originally heard some song on pandora and thought that I should check it out.  Amazon had a sale on the album so I thought it was worth buying the album instead of a few songs.  If you like folk-sy type indie rock, than this is a great album for you!
B009329ZF2|1.0|Title almost says it all. Some bad movies are real bad. This I must say makes my #1 bad of all time. How did this crap even make screen...
B0058VW36U|5.0|more people gave it a 1 star then 3 I think that every single person shoud give it 5 stars if rocks
0345803485|5.0|I start reading every book slowly until somewhere in the story, I find it more interesting and want to read more and more. I refuse to put a book down that I have started reading until it is finished. I just want to say that from the first chapter..I could not put the Fifty Shades of Grey book down! It captivated my attention immediately! I love this book and recommend it to anyone looking for a great romance with a bit of comedy intertwined in the story!!
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Runs flawlessly on my Kindle after 20+ games. Nicely done and very fun. 5 stars in graphics...game play...concept...and very addicting. I'm concerned that there was a number of reviews mentioning Kindle crashes.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I've watched this movie forever it seems and now have it in a colorized version that couldn't be better, unless the whole thing were to materialize in flesh and blood, bricks and mortar. In the colorized version, they've done it in a sepia tone/color effect that closely approximates the tones used in graduation photos during the 50s when I graduated and, therefore, seems appropriate for the period.<br />But for those purists who believe the original must be maintained, there's the black-and-white version to satisfy their preferences. My approach to that argument is black-and-white may have been chosen to suit a budget but we see in color, so why not have it that way if possible. Granted, some movies are shot in black-and-white to instill a mood; Citizen Kane and Psycho come to mind. But Kafka was shot in both in different places to achieve the desired effect.<br />Whichever, I wholeheartedly endorse this combination presentation. Well done.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I just started playing but so far its been fun. I noticed you have to pay to replenish dash but am hoping that isn't required to keep playing the game.
B0053O89IS|4.0|While I am happy for Emily Deschanel for having her baby and all, I am disappointed that the season was not as long as it usually is.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple yet challenging. Hours of fun or a quick few minutes. This game is good for both. I am addicted.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I've seen the movie prior to buying it, and I just have to say this was Clint Eastwood and Angelina Jolie definitely need to team up again!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|so helpful to know exactly how much you have left depending on how you're using it. great app. get it!
B0014JKJHK|2.0|I had these before but I bought them from the actual croc store this time I decided to buy them from online and they are super slippery I slide all the time and they are suppose to be slip resistant super disappointed!
B008MM9630|5.0|i love the game you can ignore the game for a bit then come back and everythings the same. i havent had any problems
B004SUWR2C|4.0|never mind I just did not have Internet it works fine now but I was sure are ready downloaded it from uno free.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From the very beginning of this series, I was hooked. The author lures you in with wondering how/why/what happened to create this society. Wool was one of the most intriguing reads I've had in awhile. At times the author can be overly-descriptive about actions which becomes slightly annoying, but if you don't care for reading every detail it is very apparent when these sequences come about. Overall, I would give this series 4.5 stars, but obviously Amazon doesn't have 4.5 stars. So being an cheerful person that I am, I'm giving this SERIES 5 stars and would recommend a read.
B0011Z7JRU|4.0|I only paid about a dollar to download this whole album. Thats a great price. I just wish I could burn a copy to CD so I can play it in my car. Maybe there's a better, more high tech way, to take this music with me. Currently I am unaware.
034580404X|5.0|I wanted a few good books to end the summer season and was told about these by a colleague.  I was so excited to know that it was available as a set and that I didn't have to purchase them individually.  It was so convenient!  I will recommend them to everyone, they are quite the read! :O)
B008XG1X18|3.0|Was so excited to see an android app...wish it worked better. I frequently get kicked off or it freezes. Hope they work out the kinks soon.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Ive never been compelled to write a review before. It's 2:30 am and I just finished this book.<br />Great pace, great characters, great action and just the first book!  Well done
B007PVHAN2|5.0|Not only is this an excellant documentary on the life of Bob Marley.  It also fills you in on the history of the Rastafarian Religion in Jamaica.  The suprise is the development of the recording industry in that country.  Plus they introduce you to all of the other artist and record people of that era and the political climate they created in.  I have viewed it again and again.  Well worth the price!!!!
B004QHR5GA|4.0|Ethereal, engaging and dreamy, these songs bounce with an understated happiness. Reflections on the bliss and sadness of love, both of them transcendent in their own way, get captured in these well-crafted, yet not self-conscious, tunes. If you liked the song Oliver puts on his record player you will also enjoy the rest of the soundtrack. Just as the film gives us the sublimity of the uncertain, especially in romance, these songs also touch the very human soft spot we have for love's promise.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|When I started working in sound I set out to find good headphones. I noticed that every professional operation be it radio, recording studio, or video production house always used Sony 7506's. I visited manu production facilities and schools such as Full-sail ect. Every professional place only had these headphones. Being no stranger to the business world I figured the reason must be either the headphones were cheap or the best. It turned out to be the later. I've used the Sony 7506's for over 15 years. There is a reason Sony has never changed the design of these headphones, you can't improve upon perfection. I have never had a pair fail on me. The only part that ever wears out are the ear pads and they are easily replaceable.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I really enjoy this app every night. Personally I like the river sound, very soothing. I set the timer on it for 30-1hr. One thing I don't like about is if you need to use other apps on phone it stops playing.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Book was very good if your a fan of the series. It takes a little bit getting into but it ends up being good, and the ending was great.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This app was preloaded into my Kindle Fire, and I really enjoyed it at first.  I am curious about weather conditions around the globe, and this app served me well.  About 2-3 months ago, it's reach shrank to the 48 states.  If I ask for weather in Australia, for example, I get an error message to the effect that the data is not currently available and to try again later.  My e-mail messages to the address for Weather Channel given on the app yields silence...no response.  I would like to restore this feature or find out if the service is now restricted.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Omg this is awesome it lets me see if I need to charge my kindle fire or not try it
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is fun game. Can't wait for more levels! Entertaining for the entire family. You will like it, I'm sure.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved the book! I can not wait for the next book to come out. I passed the book up a while ago and I am glad that some one else told me ro read it. It was an easy read and waiting for the next book.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love the app!  its super User friendly and even my kids get a kick out of it! the only complaint I would have is it is very temperamental it doesn't always load and you may need to force close a couple of times to get it to work.  other then that I love it!
B005JZBPHS|5.0|i loved this! I've been waiting to watch this for a few years now since I've heard of it and I finally got around to ordering the complete series & I love it! touched home with me and I know it has opened up a lot of eyes for those who weren't able to understand. love it love it loveit!!!!
B001VFEKOK|4.0|new moon is aweson but this is almost better! I have all 4 twilight soundtracks! Non stand \\"too close\\" to this one!

If it comes with new moon by that one too! Because it rock!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The watch itself is great. I've had it a little over 3 weeks now and its been accurate to within 2 seconds a day. I replaced the band with a green 20mm Zulu nylon band that I forced through the 18mm spring bar. It looks a little more 'masculine' than the smaller 18mm band does, in my opinion. I'm taking a star off because of the 18mm band. Seiko has a replacement for this model that DOES feature 20mm bands, but its almost 2x the price, and the hands on that one are not as attractive to me.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this watch, especially if you're going to be replacing the band. Wearing a mechanical auto-winding watch is something just 'feels' better than a quartz powered watch. It feels like a real crafted piece, not something churned out buy a computerized factory robot. I know that thats not necessarily the case, but looking at the gears and springs in the clear glass window on the back of the watch just looks much more like something an artisan craftsman would make. I'll take the 'inaccuracy' of 1-2 seconds a day to get that vintage and well crafted feeling any day of the week and twice on Sundays.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|This product is total garbage!! The provided drivers dont work. I had to google the correct drivers, when finally installed, OMG this card is total Crap. I was expecting this card to scan tons of signals, unfortunately it doesnt, plus it gets poor signals.<br />In Linux it did scan loads of signal with all 4 bars signals, but unfortunately you cant even connect.<br />If looking for a good card with long range go with Alfa awus036h 1w..Dont fall for awus036nhr 2000mw advertisement, its false!

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I loved this movie. It's just as good as all the other movies I've purchased in the last six months (Thor, The Green Lantern, Captain America, and many more). Though I did not purchase this through amazon (purchased through the Disney club) I'd recommend this movie to all.
B008MEM24S|5.0|While there are simalure points, in Perry as in Water. If you're. a fan of the P & P Tv show just the voice comments you hear Dr. D. sound off with, along with Mg. M.

B0026JWDQW|2.0|If you loved \\"These Streets\\"... Skip this album!<br />\\"Sunny Side Up\\" is totally different and not in a good way.
B0086700CM|4.0|the concept of the game is very nice. But I feel it becomes monotonous after few minutes of play, may be because of repetitive pattern
B0063GORYU|5.0|The best solitary game I've tried so far.  Even though I'm only playing with two suits, I still feel challanged, so I know I can play this for a while before I get bored.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's already released here in Oz for the past few days and have to say of all the live action 3D films presently ( excluding documentaries ) the full potential of 3D technology was used to great effect on this film. It really will blow your mind.<br />  The story is an absolute ripper all thanks to the genius of Joss Whedon his wit and humor and also trademark killing off unexpected important and well loved character/s ( agent Phil Coulson played by actor Clark Gregg ) is quite known during the Buffy/Angel/Firefly era.<br />  The feature film is an absolute Legend although sadly even with the amount of special features included on the 3D Blu Ray disc it is quite lacking in content.. but then you have to think hey -- The Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and even Black Widow and Nick Fury already had heaps of special feature interviews and the like done in every one of those DVD/Blu Ray discs, fans just need to collect them to see it all.
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked the premise of the book and the writing.  It was very similar to the 50 Shades trilogy. I will definitely read the second book when it comes out.

0385344228|4.0|William Landay's Defending Jacob is one of those books that will slowly and methodically invade your mind, your thoughts and, yes, your fears.  As a parent, this book scared the hell out of me.<br /><br />The primary question generated from this intense and powerful work is how well do we really know someone?  While it's a conundrum faced by many characters, the character of Andy Barber is a novel one (no pun intended) because Andy looks at the situation as not only a father but as a prosecutor whose mind examines evidence legally and scientifically.<br /><br />Andy's inner turmoil radiates off each and every page, evidenced by his crumbling marriage to Laurie, his strained relationship with his son Jacob and a forceful reexamining of his own upbringing.  These scenes, those with Andy's agitation, grief and shame over what his son has been accused of, are so incredibly powerful they are unnerving to read.  I felt nervous and agitated, as if I was peeking in on a family situation that I had no right to view, and yet I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />As much as I was frustrated with Andy, convinced that he was refusing to see what may or may not have been in front of him, I sympathized with him.  I sympathized with his predicament, being ostracized by his neighbors and community, his profession.<br /><br />Equally, my heart broke for Laurie, who desperately wanted to believe in her son but also wanted to connect with Andy, and wanted her family to heal and return to the happy and safe place they had been in previously.  I felt as though I was standing by her side as her marriage and headstrong joy for living slipped away, and as the trial started.<br /><br />The scenes dealing with the trial were fascinating to read.  There was a bit of legal terminology and procedure but the average reader should have no difficulty in following and absorbing the drama.<br /><br />Defending Jacob threw a few curveballs at me during the course of the book and the ending was a surprise, to say the least.  It certainly stuck with me after I had closed the book and while writing this review, I feel the same uneasiness and borderline panic I felt while immersed in the story.<br /><br />Defending Jacob was a compelling and thought provoking book that is a combination legal thriller, mystery and family drama.  The writing is near flawless and author William Landay tells this story with a simple poignancy that packs an incredibly powerful punch.  Portions of the book are akin to the eye of a hurricane, the calm before the coming storm and what a storm it is.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to wholly and unconditionally recommend Defending Jacob.  It is a read that is well worth every moment spent with Andy \\"defending Jacob\\".<br /><br />Job well done, Mr. Landay.  I anxiously await your next work.<br /><br />©Psychotic State Book Reviews, 2012rprise, to say the least.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|A challenging game that is bound to be worth your time! Easy enough for kids to play and enjoy (my 6 yr niece loves it!), but also hard enough to keep a grown up busy for a while!
0525423656|3.0|If I had to compare Crossed to Matched, I'd have to say I was a little disappointed. I was all excited to read about life outside the Society and I wanted to see Cassia and Ky reunited, but this book was just missing that spark, that oomph that makes a book last in your memory. Every page was beautifully written, and Condie has a poetic style of writing. There were so many wonderful quotes that I kept reading over and over again. But when it came to actual plot, I can't help but feel that not much happened in this book. For most of Crossed, Cassia is searching for Ky. Nothing important really happens until the end. While we learn more about life outside the Society and the suffering of the Aberrations, I found this book was more of a in-between book in the series, one of those filler novels that moves the reader into the third book.<br /><br />I did love how the book shifted between Ky's and Cassia's POV's. We finally learn more about Ky, and all of those burning questions I wanted answered from the first book are answered. Unfortunately, with books that have more than one POV, there's always the chance that one of the POV's will be less interesting. In Crossed, I loved reading Ky's thoughts, but I always wanted to speed through Cassia's side of things to reach Ky's parts. It's not that I don't like Cassia, but that I just didn't care what happened to her. That sounds awful, but I wasn't invested in her throughout the whole book. Plus, I felt no chemistry between Ky and Cassia. They had their stolen moments, but it just wasn't the passionate romance I would have imagined.<br /><br />The love triangle: frustrating. I feel like I keep repeating myself, but I really need to read a book without a love triangle next. I know it was necessary for the premise with the whole two Matchs received which is an anomaly, but I'm still not a fan. I love both Ky and Xander, and I hate to think that one of them or both will  get hurt in the end. For the love triangle to work in thiscase, I think both of the guys need to be present throughout the book, driving Cassia to have to choose between her safe life in the Society and a dangerous match with an Aberration. But the book synopsis above is a little misleading because Xander was hardly in Crossed. I wanted to see more of him. He was present in thought and conversation, but he just wasn't a significant part of the book. There was an unpredictable twist concerning Xander which interested me (no spoilers), but I wanted more scenes between Cassia and Xander. Right now, it just feels like it's Cassia and Ky, and then that other guy. Not cool.<br /><br />As always, I loved the inclusion of poetry and the value given to literature and art. I liked the new characters introduced, especially Vick. I couldn't stand Indie, but she's a strong character (though a little cold) and the complete opposite of Cassia. I'm glad it wasn't the same old characters, and I loved the Carving and the new parts of this dystopian world we're allowed to see. But I was confused about the whole Enemy versus the Society versus the Rising. I thought the Enemy was the rebellion? Maybe I just missed something.<br /><br />I will read the third book, Reached, when it comes out in November because I feel like I've committed to this series, and now I have to know what happens. I just hope I like the third book more than Crossed. I liked the sequel, but it's not a new favorite or a possible reread.
B005LAJ16I|3.0|If you have not seen the series then I would highly reccomend you buy it. It is one of the best shows in the last 10 years. So when I heard the DVD was coming out I was excited and pre-ordered it so I would be able to see some behind the scenes, deleted scenes etc. Unfortunatly the DVD was so weak compared to the show. It had 5 or 6 deleted scenes, a little segement on the characters and only the first episode had a voice over thatdid nothing to explain the episode.<br /><br />  Like I said before this is one of the best shows in the last 10 years, But if you have seen the series I would not reccomend buying the DVD.
0525478817|4.0|This is my first John Green book. Please don't judge me. I try to avoid cancer books because I've lost too many family members and animals to cancer. I just can't handle the waterworks. I'll be curled up in a ball, rocking myself, going why why as Niagara Falls pours down my face. Okay, dramatic, I know. But this was like The Book Thief all over again. Two things I can't handle emotionally: cancer and the Holocaust. Oh, and dying animals (p.s. no animals were harmed in the writing of The Fault in Our Stars).<br /><br />Despite the tears and the inevitable sadness of Stage IV thyroid cancer and the Holocaust, I still loved The Fault in Our Stars and The Book Thief (random little thought there). The Fault in Our Stars was beautifully written, even the sad scenes. Despite the ever-present subject of dying, Green managed to skillfully intertwine humor and sadness, making the story all the more poignant. One moment, I would be fighting off tears, and the next I'd be laughing out loud. I honestly don't know how he did it. And there was poetry! As a poet, I'm all about poems in YA books or any books. Green fit philosophy, literature, and poetry into the story, and all of it was relevant to the plot. It flowed naturally, and it didn't seem like he was simply including quotes in order to appear highly intellectual. And \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" is one of my top favorite poems EVER. Good job Green!<br /><br />Green developed his characters so well. I felt like I knew them, and I wanted them to be real simply because I felt connected to them. I felt what they were feeling, whether it was happiness, despair, or anger. I loved their quirks, their ability to find happiness in the bleakest of situations. I loved their strengths and their weaknesses, their compassion and their hobbies. The video games, the books, the oxygen tank named Philip, and the little sayings they said to comfort each other fit wonderfully into the story. I couldn't help adoring Hazel and Augustusand Isaac. Especially Augustus. His energy and affection for Hazel was adorable.  I think it's so hilarious though that he's a gorgeous, blue-eyed (Elijah Wood) cancer patient who knows big words and loves V for Vendetta. And they said so much in their conversation. I learned things I didn't want to know about the world and humanity and mortality, and it was all so meaningful.<br /><br />I was not a fan of the 35 year olds trapped in teenage bodies. It distracted me from the main plot and messed with my head. Okay, maybe cancer changes you, or forces you to leave childhood behind earlier than you'd like. But even the adults in this book were taken aback by Hazel's and Augustus's behavior. Their parents even recognized their children were weird. Because they were really weird. Sometimes it was endearing, but other times, it was annoying. It was a little too much for me, even if I chose to suspend disbelief or something like that. Augustus admits he's pretentious, and I have to agree. I just can't imagine teenagers saying what these two said. It was as if they had recited speeches for every minute of the day.<br /><br />Besides that, I really did enjoy this book. While it made me cry, I know it will last in my memory for a long time! It was definitely a more than worthwhile read.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|The greedy spiders games keep you busy, but I don't think it works right on my Kindle. The first time I played GS2, I used the hint to better understand what the freeze function does. When playing though, the freeze function does not do the same thing it does while showing on a hint. Actually, it appears to have no effect at all. Maybe I need to reinstall it? At least now the game didn't cause my Kindle to lock up like it used to.

B00028HBKC|5.0|I loved this film! As it depicts the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, you can expect that it is going to be violent, gory, tragic, and extremely bloody. It might just be too much for some to take. Good! It's what happened to Jesus Christ because of our sins. He took on all that suffering for us and the film is true to the torture Jesus endured because of His passion, yet it astounds me to read the reviews that give this film one star precisely because of the violence in it. It is also appalling to read the misinformed non-believers disgrace His memory by daring to type the word \\"myth\\" with anything regarding Jesus. Jesus was not only an actual person who walked the earth and left His footprints, He is a historical figure, and the Redeemer of all humanity. So sad that there are still so many ungrateful people. As John Paul II stated after seeing this film, \\"It is as it was.\\"
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Having not read the book, I didn't know what to expect. The \\"Wonderlandish\\" clothing styles was the first thing that keeps you from immersing yourself in the movie.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have been reading fantasy books for 22 years since i was 10 years old. So, like an old veteran, i'm not easily impressed or moved. That is why i was caught off guard and was completely blown away by this book.<br /><br />It is amazing. A wonderfully told coming of age story about an extraordinary boy, abandoned by his family to become a warrior monk, and one of the most hated and feared people in the world (or at least in some parts of the world).<br /><br />It is written as a dictated journal which make every scene very personal and made me completely identify with the hero.<br />The story itself is presented as past events after the hero's star has fallen, which gives the story a sad undertone, which i personly love, and reminded me other favorite books of mine like \\"The Farseers Trilogy\\" and \\"the Kingkiller Saga\\".<br />In Summery, if you dont like it you dont have a heart.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|This $170 million 'reimagining' of the Brothers Grimm classic is thin, unnecessary and painfully slow. Theron delivers the 'Disney acting guide to being an evil queen', alternatively over-acting and screaming while preening for all the CG airbrushing shots. Stewart provides her normal mouth-open stare that's somewhere between slightly stoned and trying to find the reset button - it's hard to remember that she's supposed to be the fairest of the them all. And then there are the dwarves, a CG shortening of regular actors, that are intended to provide comic relief but come across as strange and creepy.<br /><br />Almost nothing in the script works very well. It starts very, very slowly, failing to build any real tension throughout, and the ending is foreshadowed so plainly from Act 1 that it couldn't have been more obvious. There are several set piece scenes that do nothing for the plot, the worst of which is a shiny fruit bowl that's supposed to be the mirror. Whereas the mirror in Shrek was a clever reworking of the Disney mirror, this mirror is like the fairy tale version of the T-1000 but without the same quality finish, and after two appearances is never mentioned again in the film. The same is true with the scene where Snow White tames a troll - after a fairly substandard fight sequence, she mysteriously becomes Snow the Troll Whisperer for absolutely no point whatsoever.<br /><br />Even the story logic is really dreadful. The queen's brother tells the Huntsman that the queen can't bring his dead wife back to life at *exactly* the point where he should have said nothing. The queen fears the Dead Forest at the beginning but quite happily goes there later in the film. There are creepy asexual sprites hiding in the birds for no reason at all. It's a collection of ideas that don't gel or work together to move anything forward. ** Possible spoiler ** The finale is one of the worst I can remember with Snow White killing the queen in the most banal, simplistic way with no help from any of the characters she meets throughout - after two hours of the queen showing off her 'mad spellmaking skillz', she lets an overly-armored Snow White just walk up and finish her off. I was literally screaming at the TV in disbelief when this happened!<br /><br />Finally, the film struggles to find a tone throughout. It's Joan of Arc meets Lord of the Rings somewhere in The Neverending Story but leaves the viewer realizing that Lord of the Rings is an incredibly well-made film and this is an excuse to extract $10. The world created here is devoid of any charm or magic and creates no lasting impression - and actually, that's not just the CG world but really the feeling I had about the whole movie. What a huge disappointment.no help from any of the characters she meets throughout - after two hours of the queen showing off her 'mad spellmaking skillz', she lets an overly-armored Snow White just walk up and finish her off.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Awesome book! The writing is So incredibly clever! The story took such a turn that I didn't see coming. People who gave it a 1 or 2 are nuts!  The ending was a bit weird but I still liked it. It is an ending that leaves you thinking and wondering. All through the book you keep wondering who is more nuts. How the author thought of the story line is beyond me!  Great idea to write from each of their perspectives. The detail she writes makes it sound so realistic. Little details that make her so clever.<br />Look forward to your other books.

B005AUWY90|3.0|Most critics argue that Cars 2 lacks the gravitas (someone else's word, not mine) of previous efforts. While I think that going into a cartoon expecting a deeply moving experience is silly for an adult, I'll grant that Pixar injects some sentiment into their movies, but it's often a tad cloying. As for the original Cars, what was the big teary epiphany? That you need to take a break from the rat race and smell the desert roses once in a while? That you shouldn't judge people too harshly at first? Are these serious lessons any more so than the one from Cars 2 that dealt with being yourself? I don't think so. They're both fortune cookie fodder. The reason I enjoy Pixar movies is because they're entertaining, funny, and visually appealing. The harder you try to focus on some larger commentary, the less I like the movie (I'm thinking of Up and Toy Story 3 at this point).  You're making a cartoon. Stick with the entertainment and spare me the maudlin manipulation. Although it can be argued that Cars 2 tries too hard to make a point about alternative fuels, how in the world is this bad unless you are affiliated with a major oil corporation?<br /><br />As for the fact that most of the original cast is marginalized, I applaud taking the concept in a totally different direction. Most sequels fail because they try to replicate the original movie. In Cars 2, they left it all behind and went on a global espionage thrill-ride packed with new characters and plenty of wink-wink nods to foreign culture, spy movies, and the Pixar cannon. It's the most action-packed Pixar movie since The Incredibles and since the sequel to that movie -the best one in Pixar's history - is stalled, I'll take what I can get.<br /><br />While Cars 2 is not going to end up on my shelf because it's too long, has too many annoying self-references (including the aforementioned Incredibles and a pathetic one for director John Lasseter), and the grating Larry the Cable Guy has far too big a role, at least I don't feel like I wasted my time with it like I did with both Toy Story 3 and Up.n't feel like I wasted my time with it like I did with both Toy Story 3 and Up.

No surprise from Helen Mirren, even the younger ones were excellent. But if you are like me, only wanted to enjoy a good movie, skip it. It is not what you think it is. There is no story, just the same old moral lessons that Hollywood want us to listen to over and over again. The preaching is insufferable.

0307594777|5.0|Okay, so by now I'm sure that everyone has heard of the phenomenon that is \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\". The new film has recently been released and there have been multiple discussions about the series.<br /><br />So, the series contains three books; \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\"; \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\". They were written by Swedish author Stieg Larsson and were released in 2004. Unfortunately, Larsson never got to see what a huge success his books became, as he passed away in 2004 at age 50 of a heart attack.<br /><br />It should be noted as well, that the Swedish title for \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is translated as \\"Men Who Hate Women\\". Sure it's less prose-like, but it fits the series better in my opinion. Although, I do have to agree that the English title is just a better hook. Though, my problem with it is,<br />1. It is not the original title (but fair enough) and<br />2. The dragon tattoo is never explained and is in fact not a core part in the books. It's just a tattoo that Lisbeth has. We never find out when she got it, whether it represents anything or anything about it at all. All we know is that it hurt to get and is on her back/ shoulder blade. But hey, it makes for good cinematography.<br /><br />Now, this is just a little side note, but I absolutely love this version of the cover art. All the details in it are amazing. For those who own these books, have you noticed that on the back covers at the top it says, \\"Issue 1 (or whatever the book number is) Millennium Magazine\\"? Great little detail.<br /><br />Okay so some background on the books themselves. Well, they're predominately crime novels. The best of the best. In terms of what kind of crime novel they are? They're a mix of murder mystery and corporate and government scandal. Describing what the books are about is hard, as there are so many different story lines going on that it would take a while, but in the most pure terms ofdescription then<br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is about: (courtesy of the blurb)<br /><br />\\"The Industrialist<br />Henrik Vanger, head of the dynastic Vanger Corporation, is tormented by the loss of a child decades earlier and convinced that a member of his family has committed murder.<br /><br />The Journalist<br />Mikael Blomkvist delves deep into the Vangers' past to uncover the truth behind the unsolved mystery. But someone else wants the past to remain a secret and will go to any lengths to keep it that way.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo<br />Lisbeth Salander, the enigmatic, delinquent and dangerous security specialist, assists in the investigation. A genius computer hacker, she tolerates no restrictions placed upon her by individuals, society or the law.\\"<br /><br />Okay, so I'm not going to put the blurbs for the other books up because they might contain spoilers, but onto the review.<br /><br />So, just a little bit about the flow of the books and the time frames that each of them are set in relation to one another. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is the first and most unrelated to the others. It's more of an introduction to the characters and their relationships. Don't get me wrong, it's a great book in itself and is definitely going to keep you hooked and wanting to read the next two books, but the plot line isn't really carried on into the next books. Elements of the first book are brought into the next two, but only little things.<br />However, I do think that the first book is the best in the series, just in terms of the ending. I'm not going to give it away to those who don't know, but I will say that the ending is amazing. Larsson has an incredible ability to be able to start with several seemingly unconnected threads, that he slowly brings together into one story. It's fascinating to watch as the connections are made. Some are ones I guessed were coming, but others were almost out of nowhere, and the ending definitely keepsyou guessing till the end.<br /><br />\\" The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" takes place a year after the end of the first book. So a large portion of it is catching up with our characters, as well as the introduction of new ones. This is the book where I would say the actual story begins. The first book is almost like a one-shot and the next two are where the mysteries start to get explained and we find out how many bad men there really are in the world. And in Larsson's books it is always men. He very much plays the women as victims, which may be a reason why he has so many powerful female characters in his books. To be fair, he was very much trying to prove a point, and it may be of interest that when he was 15, Larsson witnessed a gang-rape of a young woman, who interestingly enough was called Lisbeth.<br />And finally, the last book in the trilogy is \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\". It takes place right after the end of the second book, which ends on a cliffhanger. And of course, this is where we finally get our answers and discover the entire truth.<br /><br />Now onto the characters. I thought they were very well rounded and intriguing. And I made that all important connection with a lot of them, that makes you care about their fate and upsets you if they suffer or die. However, I didn't feel that with all of the characters. There are a LOT of them, and it would be hard to get us to care that much about each and every one. There are also a lot of deaths in these books, which are shocking, it's true, and I did feel bad that about some of the deaths- but that may have been partly down to how violent and brutal they are. I cannot think of a single death that wasn't. Well, except for one, but that was a long drawn out death that can't have been pleasant.<br />Personally, Larsson did a great job at getting us to care about the pivotal characters, but more than that, he made us want them to care about each other. Not necessarily in a romantic sense, but there isa large amount of the story where the two main characters have no interaction at all, and I missed them playing off each other.<br />I'd be interested to know whether Larsson himself was anything like Blomkvist. Larsson was a journalist himself (at a magazine called \\"Expo\\") and the magazine was in the same financial crisis as \\"Millennium\\". So, I'd like to know what other similarities they had, if any.<br />I know that Lisbeth has been described as a unique character and indeed she is, at least in terms of any heroine I've read about or watched. She is a little hard to relate to, simple because her personality is on the extreme side, but for good reason. But I think what works best about the characters is that they are flawed. They are in no means perfect and are indubitably human. They are believable characters, which is definitely saying something in Lisbeth's case.<br /><br />I did, however, have a few criticisms. Like others have said, the books can be a bit slow moving and there are long pages of description about Sweden's past that can be a little confusing for those of us who don't know much about it. Now, I do think it works in this book, just because there is so much going on that it needs a lot of description, but it can feel like overwhelming. In one of the books, Lisbeth is in hospital and remains in the same bed for 500 pages. But, on another note, the last 100 pages of each book is always very fast-paced and will have you on the edge of your seat, unable to sleep until you reach the conclusion.<br />Another criticism is that there are a lot of names- be it places or people- and it can be hard to remember them all, especially from the point of view of someone who has never been to Sweden and doesn't speak Swedish. But, even if they were all in my first language, I still think I'd have trouble remembering them all. And in each book more are added. You do get to know what the recurring characters names or place names are, but I found myself often confusingthem, and thinking that it was a different character or place.<br />My last one is Camilla. She is mentioned quite a few times, but never really explained. And in the end, we never really find out anything about her except that she is \\"listed as living abroad\\". I don't know if Larsson was perhaps planning to write another series or book about Camilla, but it would have been nice to learn more about her.<br />But these criticisms are pretty small compared to all the ways I can compliment this series.<br /><br />Now the overall ending. I think it was very well written. I will say that (for the most part) we know how it's going to end on the whole. Maybe not what will happen with all the characters, but the main plot line is predictable- although Larsson pulls that off as a good thing. If it had ended any other way, the books would never have been as good as they are. The ending, afterall, is all about justice and there was really only one way to achieve that. And the way it's told is so satisfying. As the net is slowly tightened and the \\"bad men\\" start to realise what's going on. And if you're worried that not all the questions will be answered, fear not. All the loose strings are then explained and tied up with the rest.<br /><br />I do have one more thing to add. This is one of those series where having read the series really makes a difference to the way you view all the characters if you re-read it. Knowing everything about each individual and exactly what's going to happen brings a new light to it and you notice little things and hints that you missed the first time around. I know that's true of pretty much everything, but I think it's especially true for this series. Maybe because we know so little about our main character that, when the blanks are finally all filled in, she almost becomes a completely different person.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this book. I think it caters to a wide range of wants, and it can be enjoyed by people of all personalities, both men and women alike- which is hard to do. I will say that there should probably be an age restriction though, just because the content is not really suitable for younger readers and there is a lot of violence. Other than that, read these books. I was introduced to them by my cousin, read the first book and instantly went out to buy the series. You really can't not get hooked by it. And the books raise an interesting question. If you were in Lisbeth Salander's place, what would you do?
B007CBEO20|5.0|Europe is band that has been with us now, for a very long time. The new album \\"Bag of Bones\\" is a strong collection of well written songs that showcase the experience and maturity of a band that has traveled the globe and performed hundreds of shows to millions of people. Joey Tempest still has a powerful voice and full command of a wide vocal range. And his long time band mate John Norum is still a Guitar Hero. Norum shows a mastery of technique and tone with well designed solos and riffs on each album track. If you liked Europe back in the Eighties, you will most likely still enjoy the Europe of today. Although the players have aged,(haven't we all?) the quality of their music is still very strong. I have purchased all of Europe's albums over the years, and I still enjoy their distinct sound and style. Sure, I am biased, but I do recommend the album \\"Bag of Bones\\" to anyone who appreciates strong, melodic Rock music. One day, we will all miss the bands who have a real passion for quality Rock music.

0439023513|3.0|****Warning Spoiler Alert****<br />If you haven't read the book, you probably won't want to read my review. So stop here if you don't want to know what happens.<br /><br />I don't like investing a lot of time in a series where the ending leaves me depressed. Suzanne Collins' success at sharing the horrors of political oppression and war with people who might not have put any thought into it is very successful. Well done. I personally found it difficult to follow when her main characters basically went mad because of what they'd been through. Knowing that Gale was the one who killed Prim in the end just sickened me. I had a lot of emotion wrapped up in both characters. It was also very hard to understand why Katniss would vote for the continuation of the Hunger Games when that was exactly what she'd been fighting against. In the end, she makes a choice that will effectively end them, but when it came for a vote, she chose to vote for them. How can you not feel ill about her choices when you've lived through so many harrowing events with the characters? In the end, you have two very wounded people who are living the best they can. Not a \\"happily ever after\\" story. And maybe that's what she wanted to portray. All of us are wounded in some way and are living our lives the best we can.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Not something that I would normally read but it was recommended by a friend and now I have nearly finished the whole series of the \\"game of thrones\\", and I have really enjoyed it. A historical fiction set in the age of Kings and Knights fighting for a divided kingdom, it could be bloodthirsty and unrealistic at times but I enjoyed the characters nice and NOT so nice that kept the story interesting. The whole series is told as by different characters and it is sometimes hard to keep track of everyone but once you have read enough this isnt a problem. Great read!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Because of how much I disliked Hunger Games and how the relationship between Katniss and Peeta was handled, I wasn't going to read the rest of the series. I previewed the movie to make sure it wasn't too intense for teens. The movie gave me the incentive to go back and read Catching Fire. I wasn't disappointed in the political side of the story, but I'm not sure I can recommend Catching Fire because of its intense emotional scenes where people who are friends are required to kill each other. It's certainly not light reading. I liked the continued growth of the relationship between Peeta and Katniss. Peeta's desire to protect Katniss has endeared me to him. I also like the relationship Katniss has developed with her handlers.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I borrowed this book using Amazon Prime because I had never read this author before. I am so glad I did. Now I want to read EVERYTHING he has written. This book is THAT good.<br /><br />Let me cut straight to the chase. If you enjoy The Twilight Zone, suspense, just a touch of horror, and a lot of mystery, give this a definite try. You will NOT figure out the ending. Throughout the book I think I figured out at least six possible explanations and not one of them was even close.<br /><br />BE WARNED. Don't start reading this on a weeknight. You will not be sleeping much. From the very first chapter I was hooked. The characters are \\"just not quite right\\" though entirely believable and it's more a feeling than an outright explanation ... much like movies that hint at what's wrong but don't come right out and tell you. This is so much scarier because the imagination is very powerful.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and check it out. If you love suspense, you'll greatly enjoy this one. Blake Crouch is a master!

B008WCP2PG|5.0|Hell yeah baby, finally us ladies get some Mancandy to watch on the big-screen!!! Within the first five minutes of the movie you get to see Channing Tatum strut-around butt-ass naked! You get several more clear snap shots of that nice rear end several times throughout the movie. Of course when he is doing a strip routine in a thong. But hey that's ok. I never watched any of the Step-Up movies so I had no clue Channing Tatum could move. The boy can dance! But besides the hot naked Bods you get to see for most of the movie (Thank Goodness), it does tell a story of a man who wants to further himself in life and seemingly leave his wild ways behind him. The movie also shows how life in the fast line could lead to self-destruction as Alex Pettyfer's character depicts. Men should watch it too. Dont be haters!
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|It's typical Ryan Gosling. A deep brooding man of few words. I'm a huge fan of his. He has an uncanny way of carrying a scene with only the most subtle expressions. And i must say, His leading lady in this one matched him in that to a \\"T\\". But i didn't care for the cinematography and although i enjoy most genres and eras of music, I really disliked the whole soundtrack. Overall, the story was interesting enough... but not all that original.
B00622B3MY|2.0|I got the movie because my two year old son loves to play with the toy cars from the movie.  It never even crossed my mind that a movie from which his favorite toys were created and from the makers of Toy Story and Cars 1 would create a movie that I would have to turn off after 30 minutes, but after watching for a half house, my son told us, \\"I scared. I scared\\" and we had to turn the movie off.<br /><br />I, on the other hand loved the movie.  I could do without the political message about alternative energy, but overall, I was satisfied.  I'd give the movie 4 stars, but not getting to enjoy it with my son cuts the rating in half.  We will watch it together when he gets a bit older.

B0042J6VUS|2.0|I disappointed in the phone tripod, first because it's obsolete if you have a otterbox case on your phone. The tripod does not expand wide enough for that. I do like that the small head on the tripod gives you options for angles. Overall for the price it will come in handy for my co-worker who dowsn't have the clumsys.

B007SGM084|5.0|The truth is that I thought this book was over rated because of the sex. But I was so wrong.<br />I couldn't stop reading it. It is an intelligent book,  in every page there is<br />a lot going on, easy to read, without words that you have to look in a dictionary, I loved it.
B004132HZS|5.0|Having been a fan of Sherlock Holmes for some time, I was a little leary in viewing a series putting him in the modern day, but no more! The writing is brilliant, both witty and moving, and keeps you guessing instead giving everything away up front. The cinematography is stunning and the performances are amazing! Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch make the perfect Watson and Holmes and I sincerely hope there will be a season 3!

B000001FQQ|4.0|\\"Hot in the Shade\\" by KISS, which was issued in 1989, closed the chapter in their glorious history. Two years after this album came out their talented and gifted drummer - Eric Carr died of cancer. Another great LP \\"Revenge\\" paid a tribute to him.<br />According to me the music from \\"Hot in the Shade\\" is a big but positive and nice surprise. In general, I prefer \\"Hot in The Shade\\" to \\"Crazy nights\\" (one of their previous records). Morever I guess it is almost on equal terms with \\"Revenge\\". Listening to the music from \\"Hot in the Shade\\" just once is not enough. One should play this disc more times to be inspired by this. When you try to listen to it three and more times you should get more and more into this music. I would like to share my experience with other fans here. At first the music did not attract my attention at all, excluding the tracks: \\"Forever\\" and \\"Betrayed\\". At first rehearsal, they seemed the best of all tracks. I got also an impression that the other songs were dull and boring. However when I was listening to entire album over and over again, more songs actually became my favourite. Among them I could mention: \\"Rise to it\\", \\"Prisoner of love\\", \\"Love's slap in the face\\", \\"Somewhere between heaven and hell\\", \\"Little Caesar\\". The valuable contributors to this music production were Eric Carr (I love the sound of drums he used to make) and Bruce Kulick (solo guitarist, probably of Polish origin. It is worth mentioning as I am Polish. In addition, Gene Simmons did his best to create this fabolous piece of music.

034580404X|5.0|After reading the Fifty Shades Trilogy, I am absolutely spoiled. I have started 3 other books and given up on two of them before I finished.  I found that I just couldn't get enough of the life of Christian & Anastasia. Nothing I have attempted to read since reading Fifty Shades measures up.  It surprises me that this is the first writing of E.L.James.  I certainly hope this is not her only writing.  I plan to keep Fifty Shades around for a very long time and read it over and over again.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|First off, this movie is about non-stop action/violence, and nothing more.  Watched the red band trailer multiple times before seeing this in theaters, so knew what I was getting into. If you are looking for something more then stay away.<br /><br />Loved it in theaters so I bought the blu-ray.  The coreography is awesome, and overall I didn't find it that bloody (hard to believe considering all the guys running around with machetes).  For the most part it is extremely fast paced and intense.  I will be checking out their previous film.<br /><br />I didn't care much for the dubbing on the blu-ray.  It was subtitled in the theater.  The dubbing is completely unnecessary, and I found it somewhat distracting.  Who is watching this for the dialogue?
B008XG1X18|4.0|not as good as the main site but definately fulfills the pinterest cravings. has a few issues that could be worked out but works for now.

B0034G4OUO|5.0|To explain the plot of this film is actually very simple. It is similar in plot to [[ASIN:B000I186FW V for Vendetta]], [[ASIN:B00005JN0W Man on Fire]] and [[ASIN:B006RXQ8RI Kill Bill]] - i.e. a revenge thriller. And, as a friend pointed out to me when watching the film, the dialogue is very sparse and the film is very basic.<br /><br />But to think this makes for a poor film is to be mistaken. Something about this film is raw and essential - the simple tale of a man on a mission to avenge his brother's death made all the more intense and powerful by the magnetism of Dwayne Johnson.<br /><br />One warning is that, if you are affected badly by emotionally strong films, then you may react like my friend's girlfriend and find it quite upsetting. Like the above mentioned revenge thrillers, it is not really the type of film for a romantic night on the couch!<br /><br />That said, it is a highly watchable film, which presents compelling human dilemnas - e.g. would you kill a remorseful priest who had helped kill your brother but changed his ways? Are people who kill for a living all remorseless, or does their conscience occasionally impact them?<br /><br />One last thing to mention is that the soundtrack matches the power of the film - one of the rare instances where a soundtrack matches the film, rather than getting in the way.<br /><br />Anyhow, to conclude: this film is one of my favourites and I even took my copy to give to my brother after seeing it - it's that good. I thoroughly recommend it to all who like films of the revenge thriller genre and hope that you will see past the rubbish title and image and give it a go. I'm certainly glad I did...
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I use this when I want to kill a few minutes but don't want to get involved with something else.<br />It's a nice little program and I enjoy it. I paid $.99 and feel it was worth the money.<br />I am satisfied with the performance of the program and use it on my samsung s3.

0385341008|5.0|The best thing about this book are the adorable characters as the slowly become revealed through their letter writing. I got an annotated version of this book which is nice if you like to look up the various historical and literary references, but it's also a great read without doing the extra reading.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Normally an app like this is not very exciting. This one is.<br /><br />It seems they thought of everything, giving a complete breakdown of stats on battery life, showing how much time is left for various activities. This app is a must have for any price.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app makes it so easy to find a reading plan that really works for you.  I love how it works with the Bible memory program &quot;Remember Me&quot; too.  Great app.  Worth more than every other app I have as it has eternal value.
B007SGM084|2.0|The writer comes off rather immature with her writing style and seems like she has a thesaurus glued to her hand. I felt like a high school student wrote this book series. Oh and how many times in one book can a human being use the word mutter/murmur? The series was very premature, obviously could have used alot more editing and the final book was really scattered. Could have been alot better. As for the story itself it had promise but was poorly delivered. JMHO
1594202842|4.0|I had to read this book for class, I read it in one day. The book is a pretty easy read, and I am glad that I was not bored to tears. It almost felt like I was reading a blog instead of a book.<br /><br />Those who are totally closed minded wouldn't necessarily like this book. I think it is interesting to get a view on parenting from the Chinese Culture; it is very different from how most Americans parent their children. Overall, I would consider this book favorable.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked the \\"shades of grey\\" books, then you will like bared to you even more I think. She leaves you wanting more, not quite as \\"kinky\\" but still \\"hot\\". Can't wait for the next book to come out.
0307594165|5.0|As a lifelong fan of Ms. Morrison, I was struck by how the elegance of her prose was widdled down, trimmed and refined to create this slim but thoroughly satisfying little novel.  Her characteristic lush language which has historically left me rereading and reading allowed to fully digest meaning was honed and edited down to a language that hit home with grace and pointed emotion on first reading.  This is a very engrossign and emotional story about some very endearing and accessible characters.  This was one of Ms. Morrison's most accessible and effective narratives in recent years.  A thoroughly satisfying and elevating read.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Two years ago I would never have considered calling myself an entrepreneur. Now I'm starting a business with two friends, and although there hasn't been a lot of cash flow yet, we're having a great time and learning a lot.<br /><br />I'm the reader and researcher of the three of us, and this book was my latest find. Guillebeau has done a tremendous amount of research and interviewing entrepreneurs who have left the daily grind to step out on their own. There are many stories in which the business is run online and the sole proprietor can travel while running the business, which is definitely not the case in my industry (event planning). However, many of the concepts hold true for a wide range of businesses, and I came away with lots of ideas for marketing and taking my business to the next level.<br /><br />Many books in this genre discuss starting a business that you can grow and then sell. With this batch of entrepreneurs, that's not necessarily the case. They started businesses that are meaningful to them, or that allow them a great deal of freedom with regard to schedule and/or location. And they were all businesses that netted the owners $50k a year or more.<br /><br />There's something for any business owner in here. I'd definitely recommend this book if you're considering starting a business or are knee-deep in starting up.

067101756X|5.0|The UFO crash at Roswell continues to intrigue so many and this book lets the reader know what took place at the time of the crash and well what happened after the crash. This book was nothing less than intense page by page and furthermore I now believe that I have better understanding of why the government kept us in the dark for so long.  I believe the author is truthful and I could not find any reason why he would  embellish the story.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who like myself believes that the universe is so vast that we can truly never know what all is out beyond planet earth.  If you believe in extraterrestrials,, like me, and astronomy, but best of all as mind blowing as this book is. This book is NOT science fiction. There are situations and theories in which the author leaves it to you analyze what's being presented to you.  Once I got started I could not put the book down. It's the best book I have read so far this year!

B000FJGDS4|5.0|The Aviator is a brilliant film with great acting! Leonardo DiCaprio gives a very fine portrait of Howard Hughes both as a competitive genius and as a tortured soul struggling with inner demons including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder that made him repetitively wash his hands and perform other tasks. The other actors shine, too. The special effects like what we see in the airplane crash are outstanding; the choreography is excellent as well. The cinematography reflects a great deal of forethought; director Martin Scorsese made the colors look increasingly sophisticated as the years passed to reflect how the use of color in film improved during Howard Hughes' life--this got the film an Oscar for Best Cinematography! Indeed, there's little lacking in this movie; even the musical score enhances the film greatly.<br /><br />When the biopic starts we briefly see Howard Hughes as a young boy being taught by his mother to be overly careful about germs and to avoid groups of people she doesn't like including African-Americans. The film flash-forwards to 1927 as Hughes struggles to create what he hopes will be an incredibly fantastic motion picture, Hell's Angels. Howard hires his right hand man Noah Dietrich (John C.

While in real life Hughes was married to Ella Rice and Jean Peters while romancing woman including Evelyn Brent and Billie Dove, the film focuses on Howard Hughes' romantic relationships with two women: Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) in particular and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). In addition, there's Howard's love for aviation and his desire to make planes that go faster and faster (not to mention making planes that could help the United States during World War Two); his handling of TWA to make it a competitive international commercial airline; his pride at building a huge plane he called \\"The Hercules\\" and his gradually worsening mental illness which tends to flare up when Hughes is under pressure.<br /><br />More excellent performances include Kelli Garner as a very young Faith Domergue; Alan Alda as Senator Brewster; Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, the top man at Pan Am; Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn.<br /><br />The first DVD offers an optional running commentary; but the second DVD truly has an abundance of superb bonus features to delight you.

B0086DBE62|1.0|The current trend of forcing \\"previews\\" that cannot be skipped needs to stop.  When the \\"previews\\" are for movies that came out a long time ago - and that you already own - the inability to just go to the $%^& main menu is beyond annoying and into the realm of ridiculous.  These studios need to get over themselves - their previews just aren't that valuable, and I won't continue to pay to be forced to endure their lame, ineffective marketing.

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This toy is targeted (no pun intended) towards the 8yr + kids but I can tell you there is one happy little six-year old around here today. It only took him a few minutes to learn to follow the arrow to load the darts, release the trigger when not firing to save the batteries and fire only when the supplied cartridges were in the correct location. He enjoys counting up to six when loading the darts and counting them when he collects them. Well, that's SORT of educational. The darts are soft and totally harmless. Yes, I was the primary target at first. Now he is just like \\"Pops\\" who is a gun collector! The noise can shred the nerves a little thin after a few hours. So far he hasn't discovered you can buy extra cartridges but I guess that's coming. Birthday presents are taken care of for a while.<br /><br />As for the instructions, I wouldn't know.  This was assembled by \\"Pops\\" and, as we know, men never read instructions.He just snapped it together without looking at the instructions.

1595141979|4.0|St. Vladimir's has high school drama -- biased teachers, cliques, sarcastic trashtalk, drunk parties.  The vampiric royalty and magic make it more interesting, and I was able to enjoy the book because it wasn't about high school.  It's about Lissa's sanity, Rose's coming-of-age, guarding vampire royalty, supernatural experiences, and attacking evil vampires.  \\"Shadow Kiss\\" has as many developments as \\"Vampire Academy\\", and is much better structured than \\"Frostbite\\".<br /><br />Mead does a great job at character building, softening Rose, adding dimension of Christian (who I started to like after this one), and further developing Dmitri.  The ending is a cliffhanger, a major upheaval that changes everything, and I really recommend you have \\"Blood Promise\\" waiting on your shelf for when you finish this one.  You'll want to know what happens next.

B003VS0CXS|5.0|This is an excellent transfer to Blu-ray with many, many extra goodies--for the kids and the grownups.<br />  As I watched Dick Van Dyke dance, the thought came to mind that he had formerly been a dancer and I didn't come to the realization that he was not a dancer until I heard him speak about it himself.  He was fantastic in the dance scene at the fair.  And it wasn't your typical dance scene--it was extremely complex and well done.  That was his best scene in the movie; his other good scenes were when he sang \\"Hushabye Mountain\\" and played the toy puppet in the castle of Baron Bomburst...a versatile talent.<br />  Not since the Fred and Rogers film era have such wonderful songs been written for a film; the Sherman brothers wrote some of the best songs/lyrics for the screen since the Gershwins and Berlin.  In my opinion this was the last movie of it's kind...unfortunately.<br />  Sally Ann Howes was the dessert of the movie--no one else could have been Truly Scrumptious.  Dressed beautifully in white with those curving hips magnifying her femininity from head to toe, and with the voice of a dove, how could Mr. Potts resist her?  My favorite scenes are with her singing \\"Lovely, Lonely Man\\" and when she's the mechanical automaton atop the music box.  She was amazing--that was a very difficult scene.  She stole the scene with that performance.  She was perhaps one of the very first to do a robotic dance on film. What perplexes me is that she was not nominated for an Oscar for her rendition of \\"Lovely, Lonely Man.\\"  Truly, an unforgettable scene.  She and the song both should have been nominated.<br />  This wonderful movie reeks with talent and Lionel Jeffries is another reason why--the P-O-S-H scene was made for him and him only.  His presence added spice to the film.<br />  Gert Frobe and Anna Qualye in their \\"coochi\\" scene were fantastic...masters of the art.  And Robert Helpmann as the sinister child catcher, was truly dark in his potrayal of this malevolent fiend. His voice and his facial expressions were perfect in their renditions.<br />  The children were a joy to watch...as kids they did a tremendous job.  Their best scene was when they're on the beach singing to Truly Scrumptious.  Casting did an excellent job on this film.<br />  Albert Broccoli deserves a lot of credit for going all out on the expense account; one can tell by the actors, costumes, sets etc., that it was extremely expensive but it was all very well worth it.<br />  A movie with moral songs, sentiments of true love, companionship, and humanity and a type of film that is impossible to find in theatres today.  Today's movies are all special effects without substance.  In contrast, this movie overflows with substance and class.  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang--all the way!<br /><br />P.S.

B005LAIHGI|5.0|This flick was brilliant and refreshing, it tries to be a movie with a story and it doesn't really succeed in that, it's more a loosely cobbled together compilation of sketches following a back story (like his other movies) but that doesn't matter one bit, because it is outlandishly hilarious, I had to watch it a second time right after the first and laughed even harder at the things I missed the first time around... Maybe not for those who are easily offended or for people that think political correctness is a good idea but if you can laugh at South Park this movie is for you...
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Great cast who was poorly used with weak dialogue and script. Special effects strong but little sense about why I should care about the protagonist or his adversaries. Mildly entertaining yet throw away piece of popcorn fluff if you have a couple of hours to waste.
B002BLZ6GE|4.0|First off... The kindle version has no embedded videos that would have been on the included DVD.  It would have been nice if the Amazon write-up would have explained that.  Unfortunately the kindle version was the same write up as for the paperback version, and referenced an \\"included DVD.\\" for that reason I'm taking away a star.  Poor, inaccurate write up.<br /><br />The lacking video issue not withstanding, this is an outstanding reference and includes information on all of the repairs / maintenance that a serious player needs to know.  What surprised me was the wealth of information on advanced repairs that are really more suited to someone with advanced knowledge/experience and very comfortable with the techniques and tools described.  This is exactly what I needed: a guide to regular set-ups and maintenance, and a basic understanding of the more advanced techniques of how guitars are repaired, including tools and techniques used by techs and luthiers.  This information and knowledge is critical when deciding who to allow to fix your guitar or bass!  Being able to discuss and understand the concepts will lead you to better decision making.<br /><br />My last complaint is in the OCR used to scan the text into an electronic format for the kindle.  Poor follow-up editing on the electronic version resulted in numerous misspellings (such as exclamation marks being used for lower-case \\"L\\"s on occasion, and sentences or phrases with no spaces (whichlookslikethis).  It's easy to read over and through these glitches, but honestly, you shouldn't have to.<br /><br />I bought the kindle version because I like the idea of saving paper and printing costs and I use my e-reader for nearly all of my books now, but knowing what I know now about the lack of a DVD and the sloppy editing, I would have chosen the print version.
B0068RHGJM|4.0|Wow, the new Nightwish album after probably their best with 'the new singer' and all.  I got it soon after the release, but had to let this one sink in after several listens before writing this review.  This is one of those 'it will grow on ya' kind of CD's.  It is NOT instantly likeable like DPP, Once, Century Child and other NW classics, but it really is simply brilliant.  Toumas has spent some serious time putting together a rock opera in a day where they are not appreciated at all...and it really works well *most* of the time.  There are some really sing-songy parts of this CD that I really hated at first, then I needed to remember what what going on and then I put it all in perspective.  What really put me back on track was simply the great songwriting throughout, and that signature Nightwish sound.<br /><br />I will NOT give you a blow-by-blow on the tracks...there are enough reviews out there that cover it pretty well and my review would not add to what you may have read already.  What I will say is that there are some serious time wasters on this CD that were put in to 'make it a story' and all, but when this CD rocks, it really does.  I think I am still suffering from what many fans are after hoping that this CD would be a 'Dark Passion Play and then some' (especially after 4 years).  Not the best thing for a real fan to wish, but I think we we all do in some way...Either way, this is a real milestone for an awesome band...enjoy this for what it is, and it is great.  I got the 2 CD set (1 regular, 1 instrumental version), and I had a total new appreciation for this after listening to the instrumental-only version.  Nightwish fan forever, and what will they come up with next?  I am sure it will nothing less than amazing.

1595828753|5.0|Premise: Sequel to The Promise, Part One, and Avatar: The Last Airbender<br />Tensions rise between The Fire Nation and The Earth Kingdom over the fate of the disputed colonies. Zuko seeks advice from an untrustworthy source, Katara struggles with being the girlfriend of the now-famous Avatar, and Sokka and Toph try to knock some sense into Toph's students.<br /><br />This is a really strong second chapter. At this point, fans know what is eventually going to happen with the colonies. Legend of Korra has finished its first season, and since it takes place further into the future of that world, we know the founding of Republic City is going to be the eventual solution to the political problem. Seeing how they get there, though, is a story I'm still very excited to read.<br /><br />More important than that larger story, of course, are the stories of the characters. They're dealing with more complicated problems, problems that don't have easy answers. The emotion is strong in every scene, and the dialogue continues to be wonderful. Sokka and Toph's adventures at her school are lighter in tone than the other plots, but humor has always been an important part of Avatar. Toph is particularly awesome here, she gets some nice character growth and most of the funniest lines. Aang and Katara meeting with Aang's fans takes a sharp turn towards poignant when I least expected it. Zuko's plot-line, of course, is full of rocky paths and misspoke words, and some very moving moments.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this, and if I loved it slightly less than Part One, it is only because it continues the tone perfectly, but doesn't quite top the first one. However, I rather expect Part Three to bring all our characters back together, and be amazing.<br /><br />The cliffhanger on this one certainly gave me chills.

6304711891|5.0|The Force Recon Marines are upset and they don't like the government's policy on not supporting the families of dead Marine heroes who died on illegal and undercover missions. Rogue General named Frank Hummel (Ed Harris) leads a group of Marines into a government facility to steal deadly VX gas missiles to use as a weapon to threaten the government to pay compensations to the families and also pay ransom. His men and a few other Marine volunteers have captured a tour group on Alcatraz Island and are threatening to launch the missiles against the city of San Francisco if their demands are not met.<br /><br />The government puts together a SEAL team to go into the prison to rescue the civilians and reacquire the missiles. A chemical weapon specialist, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) is sequestered and taken on the mission as well as John Mason (Sean Connery). Mason is a member of the MI6 British secret service and a former SAS captain who has been in prison for many years and held illegally. He is the only man who had ever escaped from Alcatraz and they need him to get back into the prison....<br /><br />This is a suspenseful and high action movie about soldiers trying to do the right thing the wrong way. It features a top notch cast of three major stars and a great supporting cast. The story line is well written and the conversation and interplay between the characters is great. I really liked this film and it is a five star movie with a five star cast. I recommend it to you as a good movie!

B007X4ECLY|4.0|LOCKOUT is one of those rare films that comes along every so often that, despite your brain telling you how ridiculous the film is, you can't help but enjoy the hell out of it. From the mind of former master filmmaker-turned B-actioner mastermind Luc Besson and first-time feature partner directors Stephen St. Leger and James Mather, they do a commendable job with orchestrating the chaos that is this film, which is a mish-mash of different genres, many of which don't cohere but do end up providing some terrific fun. Admittedly, I went into LOCKOUT for the first time with a good deal of apprehension, but the first two minutes of the film and the rather comically brutal interrogation of Snow (Guy Pearce) really helped to seal the deal that I wanted to keep watching regardless of how obviously silly it seemed. In the opening seconds of the film, you have Snow mouthing off to an off-screen interrogator with a cigarette in his mouth; a fist comes from off-screen and punches him in the face and Snow pops back up in his chair with the cigarette now hilariously broken but still in his mouth. This moment is essentially the mood of the film as well as the summation of Snow's character in a nutshell; it's funny and ridiculous and self-aware as well as being rude, sarcastic and tough.<br /><br />Basically, the film is a blend of DIE HARD in Space with a heaping helping of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and a dash of AIR FORCE ONE and a sprinkle of CON AIR as we move into the year 2079 where the President's daughter Emilie (Luc Besson's newest chanteuse Maggie Grace) has been taken hostage aboard MS-One, a orbital Super-Max prison where the worst of the worst go, and wrongly-convicted ex-government operative Snow is the one man who can save her. There are several wrinkles in the plan; first among them is that the take-over is being controlled by brothers Alex (Vincent Regan) and Hydell (Joseph Gilgun), one of whom is hopelessly and totally insane. Another is that Snow only agrees to the mission since the person who can help clear his name is on MS-One, so the President's daughter is not his first priority. Another is that Snow's bureacratic adversary Langral (Peter Stormare) is in charge. And last but not least is that since the escape started, MS-One is falling out of orbit and could have the potential to kill thousands if not completely destroyed. So we have the ticking clock combined with the sheltered damsel-in-distress mixed with the lunatics-taking-over-the-asylum blended with the bureaucratic bozos thrown up into a space station. If there are any successful action movie cliches I might have missed in there, don't worry; they pop up ALL OVER THE PLACE.<br /><br />LOCKOUT starts out with an increasingly-deteriorating action sequence that begins with a simple and cool fight in a hotel room, extends to a pretty nice rooftop sequence but then quickly falls apart with a motorcycle/car/helicopter/foot chase, most of which is against extremely rushed and terribly-unpolished CG which is the centerpiece of this initial chase. It makes you wonder if the visual effects crew is up to the task of creating a visually striking and impressive space station and all that something like that would entail, and it's not a good tone to kick off the action set pieces. But despite myself, I found myself enjoying the cheesy aspects of the bad effects. Again, it sets two tones for the film; one being the emphasis on FAST and the other is that \\"I hope you're not expecting AVATAR\\". LOCKOUT is not intended to be a big, impressive must-see sci-fi action extravaganza; it's a film based on \\"An Idea\\" by Besson, who's been behind some of the most implausibly entertaining action films of the last several years, such as KISS OF THE DRAGON, THE TRANSPORTER films, the DISTRICT B13 films and probably the most successful being TAKEN. These films aren't intended, like his 1990's directorial work on LA FEMME NIKITA or LEON THE PROFESSIONAL, to be genre-bending artistic and intelligentaction films. This is pure adrenaline and mass entertainment. There's nowhere in the film where you think to yourself, \\"Wow, this is a very thoughful action film\\". And like Besson's THE FIFTH ELEMENT, it was probably another idea he had when he was 16.<br /><br />I am not a proponent of the \\"Turn Off Your Brain\\" excuse when it comes to films that are very simplistic in their character and storytelling, and while some people accuse this film of playing at that, I don't agree. This film does have certain levels of sophistication in some of the sequences concocted by St. Leger and Mather (especially a fun little recurring gag with a \\"vocal trigger\\" grenade), but also particularly when it comes to the interplay between Pearce as the badass of the film (but who in the film bears more resemblance to BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA's Jack Burton than DIE HARD's John McClane) and Grace as the distressed damsel of the film. The scenes they have together work quite well and you can certainly feel a chemistry despite Snow's attitude. The film also is smart enough to wear its intentions on its sleeve. It has no pretense about it, and that in and of itself is a step in the right direction. Rather than try to overcomplicate a simplistic film, it allows us to bathe in some pretty impressive set pieces, some terrific moments of humor, and pretty much continue to build momentum.<br /><br />This is hardly Pearce's TAKEN, but I would like to see him in more roles like this because his charisma, talent and his chiseled good looks make for a good action hero. If you've seen Maggie Grace in her time on LOST, this isn't really anything new for you to see. She's very lovely and has some playfulness to her character and good chemistry with Pearce. Joseph Gilgun is the real standout here as the gleefully psychopathic Hydell, who is kind of like The Joker on meth here and Vincent Regan as the older brother is a nice, almost placid counter-balance to Hydell. Stormare doesn't have much to do here other than grimace, but that's his existence in this film.<br /><br />When you break the film down, once LOCKOUT gets going, it's hardly the level of the now-classic films that it looks to emulate most specifically, like DIE HARD or ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, but if you think this is going to be something other than the simple, fun and dirty little actioner it is, you're going to be terribly disappointed.action films.

1451627297|5.0|I admit, I'm not usually a Stephen King fan.  I've read exactly zero of his books.  However, the premise of this book drew me in like a moth to a flame.  I put it on my reading list and finally got to it during the summer of 2012.<br /><br />I have spent most of my life being fascinated by JFK, his life and his death.  I spent some time in high school researching conspiracy theories and even reading his autopsy report from one of the FBI agents who was in Dallas at the time.  Despite this, I've never been one to truly believe in a conspiracy.  Be it historical obsession or just plain curiosity, I couldn't wait to get into this book.<br /><br />Unlike other longer novels, this didn't take long to get into.  It has distinct parts to it and King does a good job at dividing up Jake Epping's time and his whereabouts.  King also creates in depth characters for his readers to get to know and love (or sometimes hate.)  I won't speak to how accurate his historical facts are because for this novel, it doesn't matter much.  This is a fictional novel, not a history textbook.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book because I think it appeals to a variety of readers.  History buffs will be curious as to what facts King gets right and what he gets wrong.  Romantics will admire the love story central to the main story line.  Baby boomers may enjoy the step back in time.<br /><br />As for the story line, I enjoyed it and felt that no loose ends were left to make the reader wonder.  And, that's all I'll say about it.  No need to spoil anything.<br /><br />King's departure from his ordinary genre is worth reading.  I'm glad that I bought it and plan to reread it again sometime.

B007K3JFUQ|3.0|Guy Richie continues his Sherlock Holmes play with \\"Game of Shadows\\" with Robert Downy Jr. and Jude Law reprising their roles.<br />It's a fast-paced film, and tries to pick up where it left off in the first film, but like many sequels, it plays its strengths too much!<br /><br />The slo-mo martial arts were interesting as in the first film, but the second one plays these out time and time and time again.  Gets a bit boring after awhile.  The early death of a woman you were hoping would take Holmes' side (rather than Moriarty) was disappointing.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (the original Swedish version) Naomi Pace made an interesting gypsy but the acting was tepid.<br /><br />What I liked about the film was the developing relationship between Holmes and Watson as they each play off each other, not always able to stand each other, but recognizing their friendship is necessary to carry out the ultimate point in their careers:  prevent the collapse of Western civilization - no pressure!<br /><br />The Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the original writer of the Holmes' stories) aspect of Moriarity and Holmes playing a chess game of sorts (literally and figuratively) while one counter plays the other is what saved the movie for me.<br /><br />A bit too much CGI and a tad too much slo-mo martial arts fighting (in the 1880s?  Really?) doesn't make this the best Holmes film to watch.  If you want original, well-written Holmes, watch BBC's Jeremy Brett or even the earlier classic films with Basil Rathbone.<br /><br />If there is a trilogy, let's hope for something a little more cerebral and less super-hero!<br /><br />Better:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000060MVK The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Boxed Set Collection)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000EXZFRQ The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection]]
1451627297|3.0|I keep wondering if King is a congenital idiot. He writes probably the best book of his life and adds an afterward using Posner's lone gunman polemic as the basis for declaring he's 98% sure of the lone gunman theory of the assassination. The last time I panned a King Book, Hearts in Atlantis, I asked how it was possible that someone who attended college in the 60's (as I did)<br />could believe an addiction to the game of Hearts was the most significant thing in his college experience.  Now I know. King is an idiot savant, an extremely gifted moron.

B0000062Y2|3.0|I'm not necessarily a sound quality geek. While I don't listen to MP3s specifically because the sound quality you get through a player is worse than that from CDs, I'm not any technology guru. Not sure I trust people who compare the sound of an LP to a digital remastering, either. So, I'm middle-of-the road here.<br /><br />The sound is AWFUL. The mix is bad. There will be quiet musical moments you can barely hear at the end of a song, so you turn up the sound and are blasted at the start of the next. The chorus is made to sound particularly shrill and terrible. The worst track of all makes hash of my favorite song: Hosanna. It does not sound anything like so awful on the DVD. I turned my head away from the image to make sure that wasn't just compensating for sub-par audio. No.<br /><br />The breaks between songs only bother me in two places: the silence between Everything's Alright and Strange Thing Mystifying, and the break between the end of the Trial Before Pilate and Superstar (the second is particularly bad, because the resounding boom from the orchestra is as much an ironic response to Pilate's sentencing as it is an introduction of Judas' song). Otherwise, I don't feel any dramatic break, and indeed many of the pauses echo moments of silence between songs in the film. It's not like that on the original album, but this isn't that album, its a representation of the performances as done in the film.<br /><br />Now, whether there is a difference between the components available for a remastering of the film's sound and the remastering of the soundtrack release, I can't say. And likely, these two divisions never even connect with one another. But, boy, I wish this had been done better. I enjoy some of the musical variations here (though the move from a rock sound to an emphasis on a more traditional sound for this work starts with this interpretation). I like Ted Neely and Carl Anderson a lot. I want to love this recording, but I only like it. I think with a good remix, I'd love it.remix, I'd love it.

0789318245|2.0|This is an ok book which does contain some impressive artwork. However, it contains of a lot of rather lousy artwork as well, and little of great interest in the text which is not found in almost every source on tattoo history. Greats like Sailor Jerry are mentioned but apparently the rights to their work could not be obtained, instead we have page after page of the amateurish scrawlings of carnies which are apparently validated simply by their age (they are 'vintage', what does that even mean anymore?). The book is oddly organized, but among its few virtues are the variety of examples it contains of classic subject matter such as hearts, roses etc. I would really only recommend this to a tattoo completist or an artist really looking to dig into the roots of classic tattoo art, as even the ugliest pieces in here could bear reinventing into something pretty great. The elements necessary to a really excellent looking style of old-school tattoo, however, are not as easy to find in this book as they should be.

Get away from her family, her famous past, just to start over again with no one knowing who she is.<br /><br />Abby tries to reinvent herself by wearing cardigans and pearl earrings. But of course, Abby meets Travis. The tattoo cover bad boy who fights UFC style underground to be able to pay for college. At first Abby is totally disgusted by him. His tattoos, one night stand life style was exactly what she DIDN'T want! She became friends with him and even made a bet with him that lead her to lose and have to spend an entire month living with him. This becomes a problem when Abbey begins to date preppy premed student Parker (the guy Abby THINKS she needs). Finally Abby's heart gives in and her and Travis finally get together!<br /><br />After secrets get revealed and a roller coaster of a relationship Abby must figure out if she should follow her heart or be with the guy she THINKS she should be with, not who she loves.<br /><br />REVIEW: I really enjoyed this book! I read all 437 pages in one day! I loved America and Abby. She was the only family Abby had and I totally understood why Abby was running away from her past trying to be someone she wasn't. I understood her hesitation toward Travis and fighting herself to be with him. He isn't exactly the guy you dream of being with but boy he sure does love her.<br /><br />I found their relationship to be very immature. It reminded me of high school relationships with all the fighting and jealously. Travis really rushed it and it made me freak out!! I understand why Abby did too.<br /><br />I liked how slow pace the story was and their love scenes were really great I thought and sweet. Abby realized you can't control who you love and you need to follow your heart more then be someone who you are not.

B006RUJST6|5.0|In the beginning I really was unsure about this book but as I got through the first couple of chapters I really couldnt put the book down. A really nice story of young love and fighting life as it comes to them. Whilst I am not much of a romance reader this was a lovely book. There was a lot of drama and twists to keep you interested. Surprisingly great.
0316069884|5.0|My newest book, [[ASIN:B0094JWK42 Vegan Cooking for Beginners: 75 Quick, Cheap, and Easy Vegan Recipes]], is the result of a lifetime of thinking through the implications of eating animals, and when Jonathan Safran Foer's book came out, I found it incredible to read such a detailed philosophical discussion of what eating another being truly means. I've always been an animal lover and I think I realized as a young child that it was weird we ate cows and pigs but not cats and dogs.<br /><br />Foer is renowned for his intellectual discourses on the world around us, and I think Eating Animals is a book every open-minded person should read. You may never have considered that because humans believe we are better than other animals and that we deserve the right to do whatever we want to them, including torture and eat them, that we are acting out on a form of speciesm similar to racism and sexism. What gives us the right? Who says we're better? Just because we say we're more important, does that mean it's true. Can it ever be right to make another species suffer for our creature comforts?<br /><br />His book is fascinating, captivating, and inspiring.

0985114606|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. Easy & fun read. I enjoyed the characters very much and can't wait for the second book this fall in the series. I definitely saw similarities between Fifty Shades of Grey. Smart, sexy, 28 year-old billionaire with major issues falling in love with your average doesn't know she's pretty girl. Only thing negative is I felt the writer tried too hard to be like FAOG and tried to add dominant & submissive roles in the characters when the story was strong in itself not to need it. But I still LOVED the book!<br /><br />[...]

B00003CXAW|5.0|I was quite young when I first saw King Kong and it has left a lasting impression upon me. This is one great film. I would give it more stars if I could. I have seen all the remakes since including Peter Jacksons' version and they all pale in comparison. This is one of the greatest action-adventure movies of all time. (with a few monsters thrown in) Willis O'Brien was a genius. His incredible stop motion animation breathed life into a lifeless creation. Plus he made Kong move in a way that not only made you believe he was real but also created empathy for him. His effects still holds up well after all these years and are more terrifying than any of the remakes. In fact, Peter Jacksons effects team attempted to re-create a minature Kong using similar materials and stop motion techniques that Willis O'Brien used and it caused them to gain a great appreciation and admiration of O'Briens work considering how labor intensive and time consuming the entire process was. As they watched certain scenes of the original film, they had no idea how the effects were being achieved. When a young Ray Harryhausen first saw King Kong , he said it changed his life. Most fans are aware that it led to his pursuit of stop motion animation resulting in future classics such as The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Jason & the Argonauts, Valley of Gwangi and countless others. The acting in King Kong is a bit dated by todays standards but that's the way acting was back in 1933. And nobody could scream like Faye Ray. My only complaint is that I feel they should have used only animation throughout the entire film instead of props in some of the close up scenes like a Kong headshot or his arm reaching for Ann. The rest of the movie however, more than makes up for it. This DVD has fantastic special features chapters which cover many aspects of the origin of the film, including O'Briens work, and even how they created the blood curdling roar of King Kong.  Now is a great time to buy this DVD as the price hascome down considerably. I love this movie and so will you.

B005D9MUWY|2.0|I bought this app thinking that it would help solve my typing issues. I have trouble hitting the right keys on my narrow smartphone screen, which results in many scrambled words. Sadly, the lack of an auto-correct feature on this keyboard makes it practically useless for my purposes. I simply do not have time to hit the word-suggestion bar every time i type a scrambled word. I'm sticking with the default Motorola keyboard for now.
B0090SI3DY|5.0|The late Roger Ebert said in his review for \\"Killer Joe\\" that the film left him speechless--and that's saying a lot, especially from a guy who's seen a lot of films. Rated NC-17, this was only available at the Opera Plaza Theater in the city (SF), but the small theater was packed! The audience laughed, gasped and--just like Ebert said--were rendered speechless by the shocking, blood-soaked finale.<br /><br />An inevitable cult classic, there are many scathing scenes (one including the creative use of a chicken drumstick), and a lot of slick, smooth dialog--especially from Joe (brilliantly played by Matthew McConaughey) who just happens to be an officer of the law who moonlights as a killer for hire.<br /><br />Hats off to veteran director William Friedkin, at 76 he has lost none of the edge he displayed in the 70's with his gritty police thriller \\"The French Connection\\", or his synth-infused masterpiece from the 80's \\"To Live & Die in L.A.\\". The story, adapted from a play by Pulitzer Prize winning author Tracy Letts (\\"Bug\\"), is right up Friedkin's alley, behind the bloody black humor his fatalistic view of human nature still shines through.<br /><br />There's horror in \\"Killer Joe\\"; audiences cringed with pure horror back in the 70's with \\"The Exorcist\\", this time they gasped and giggled at the same time.<br /><br />The overriding criticism against this film is that its characters are deplorable, and that the ending was \\"unsatisfying\\". Question: who says a film has to have likeable characters? Your film school instructor? Ever seen Martin Scorsese's \\"Raging Bull\\"? The main character (Jake La Motta) is near sub-human, but the film is now considered a classic character study of a self-destructive, sadomasochistic man. And the \\"unsatisfying\\" ending--well, if you want a classic climax and resolution check out the top 10 grossing films in America, and steer clear from anything that isn't in the top 10.<br /><br />P.S - Friedkin fans, as the screen cuts to black and Clarence Carter's 80's song \\"Strokin\\" starts blaring, don't we nostalgically recall the ending of Friedkin's [[ASIN:B00005JO5L Cruising (Deluxe Edition)]], the film Al Pacino still refuses to talk about?nce Carter's 80's song \\"Strokin\\" starts blaring, don't we nostalgically recall the ending of Friedkin's [[ASIN:B00005JO5L Cruising (Deluxe Edition)]], the film Al Pacino still refuses to talk about?
0763655465|5.0|At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like the dominating large, sparse, bold and orange illustrations that are referred to as `retro'.  My seventh grade art teacher would be very disappointed in me! But I liked the book after my first reading, and after the second reading I loved it! The story is adorable, and anyone who has or had a puppy knows that puppies do try to be good, but, oh well! George's person leaves George home for a short while, and George is confronted with a cake, a cat, and a potted plant. \\"What will George do?\\" is the question at each opportunity. This is an excellent choice for lapsit, storytime (all ages)or anytime. I can't wait to see more from Chris Haughton!

B003UBTX6S|2.0|I enjoyed the first book in this series and read it through quite quickly.  The pace was good, the characters interesting and well fleshed out.  I was really looking forward to the second book.  It took me months to get though the second book.  I read several others before I finished this one.  This book was 500 pages long and could have easily been 250.  So little happened in the first 250 pages I had to force myself to keep reading.  I did give it two stars as the last 150 pages was were all of the story happened. A couple of new interesting characters were introduced and a couple of surprising twists.  Was quite surprised to see so many positive reviews.  I don't have a lot of time to read so really hate wasting time on books that aren't great.  This one wasn't.  I may read the rest of the books in the series just because I hate to give up on a series that I have started, but I am not in a hurry.

B006XOBFJC|5.0|I owned this Ring in its initial CD release. It was one of those sets I gave a single listen to, put it on the shelf and eventually sold it off during a culling effort I undertook a couple of years ago. Since then, the set hasn't entered my mind...until I noticed it had been reissued by Sony at a ridiculously low price and remastered with 24-bit technology. The price was right, so I figured, WTH, might as well give it another chance.<br /><br />Others have commented on this set's virtues. The best I can do is to second those praises. It really is an excellent Ring, a Ring that need not apologize at all when set against the now-stiff competition.<br /><br />Pride of place goes to Ren&eacute; Kollo as Siegfried. Kollo is hands down the best singer to have essayed both Siegfrieds in a studio Ring, bar none. His voice sounds young, strong and versatile. He is on his best vocal behavior - there is none of the grabbing in the throat that afflicts, say, his Walther for Solti on Decca. Here, the voice is well supported, almost floated on the breath. He is so far superior to all other Siegfrieds in the studio sets as to have the virtue of rendering those other sets no longer competitive. In fact, Kollo is far superior here than he was in the live Ring he recorded on EMI with Sawallisch. Those who have always found Windgassen to be a poor excuse for Siegfried should be surprised/overjoyed to discover Kollo in the part, especially as there's nothing in Kollo's past recordings that would have one expecting him to do the bang-up job he does here.<br /><br />Jeannine Altmeyer is also an excellent Br&uuml;nnhilde. Her German is a bit imprecise at points, but the singing and the vocal acting are tremendous. She is extremely vulnerable here, and while her high notes aren't on par with Nilsson, they are there and they are not embarrassing in any respect.<br /><br />The casting is uniformly excellent. The playing of the orchestra is impressive. The conducting is on par with the greats. AND, the sound is really exceptional and clear.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing this set before someone at Sony decides to delete too much of a good thing.<br /><br />EDIT 5/6/14: I recently purchased the Eurodisc/Sony version of this Ring. That version - released in 2012, just like the version under discussion - features deluxe packaging, including the complete printed libretti for each opera. However, the recorded/remastered sound on that box is slightly less-good than the sound on this RCA Masters version. I must stress that the differences in sound quality are slight. That said, if your goal is the best sound possible, buy this set. If you want the libretti, super-nice packaging and sound that is only slightly less grand, go for the Eurodisc version.sound is really exceptional and clear.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing this set before someone at Sony decides to delete too much of a good thing.<br /><br />EDIT 5/6/14: I recently purchased the Eurodisc/Sony version of this Ring.

B0002KVUKM|2.0|you'll have to give Stephen Sommers this much: he knows what he wants. even if what he wants doesn't quite mesh with what would best serve the story.<br />the regrettable part is that Van Helsing isn't quite the complete-&-utter misfire it's on it's way down in history as. Sommers wears on his sleeve an enthusiasm and appreciation for the classic Universal monster movies, and even here and there manages to effectively replicate their understated gothic feel. this film could've really been something if only he'd managed to confine himself to those parameters.<br />alas, Sommers found his niche in that subgenre effectively introduced by Independence Day, the special effects-laden, basically, big wad of special effects. (he did those Mummy movies with The Rock, for cryin' out loud!) so if you already knew the name Stephen Sommers it should hardly surprise you that the film frequently slams into a thoroughly inappropriate (not to mention LOUD) CGI overload.<br />even that we could perhaps look passed, if not for the Nth degree Sommers favors. he pushes it so far that they cease to suspend your disbelief and actually feel like visual effects. when his vampires set to bite, their hitherto normal sized mouths blossom to Steven Tyler proportions. when his lycanthropy victims change to or from werewolf, they do so by ripping off their skin. (this could be a suggestion that they're \\"tearing themselves up inside,\\" but how many people will be looking for Freudian symbolism in a film like this?)<br />to say nothing the wringer the title character is put through. the character made famous in elderly scholar form by the likes of Edward Van Sloan and Peter Cushing is now...a gung-ho Rambo-type warrior haunted by the past he can't remember. Hugh Jackman is basically playing Wolverine without the claws.<br />the change makes sense in light of the sort of film Sommers had in mind, but it's difficult to reconcile the two versions. i guess you could argue that, Bela Lugosi's Dracula film of 1931 being contemporary, whereas this one is set in the 1880s, he's have plenty of time to grow old, mellow out, and becomes a professor. another possibility occurs to me: the professor version is named Abraham, whereas this one is called Gabriel, so maybe this is in fact the story of the loose-cannon black-sheep of the family.<br />(there's been much speculation as to why Sommers changed the name, but i'm not sure he consciously did. being of one of the generations that would know these characters better for the movies than the books, i suspect Sommers didn't realize Van Helsing already had a first name.<br />then again, it could be a tip of the hat to the first Frankenstein film, which, for just as readily apparent reasons, changed Dr. Frankenstein's name from Victor to Henry.)<br />as i was saying, the film did have some potential. Richard Roxburgh, like any villain worth his salt, steals the show (when his mouth isn't swelling up) as the best Dracula in some time. (the last great portrayal of The Count before this was by Leslie Nielsen for Mel Brooks' underrated Dracula: Dead & Loving It.) and the gist of his villainous scheme - being undead his children are born dead, so he needs Dr. Frankenstein research to revive them - is logical if not altogether rational. so it was never gonna be a Casablanca, but it didn't necessarily have to be an Ishtar, either.<br />basically it's a piece of \\"fan fiction.\\" there's nothing wrong with that per se, but in this case it's ultimately more about the fan than the fiction.emporary, whereas this one is set in the 1880s, he's have plenty of time to grow old, mellow out, and becomes a professor. another possibility occurs to me: the professor version is named Abraham, whereas this one is called Gabriel, so maybe this is in fact the story of the loose-cannon black-sheep of the family.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Have to admit, I purchased the book at Walmart, I had really enjoyed the first book and so was hoping that this would do the first book justice. It did, I did not expect that there would be a 25 year anniversary games nor that the games would be set up to wipe out all the previous winners who were still alive and viable as rebels. The suspense of how Katniss will win and the ingenious way that this ends are really quite surprising. Love the book, and will now go on to read the third book.<br />BTW, this thing is shown as being for teen and young adults - I'm 67 years old and fully enjoyed the first two books.
B000N2HCM4|1.0|Now technically this is my husband's review not mine...he told me what to say after he read it.  I refused to read it...the movie 2016 was more than enough for me.  It made my throw-up in my mouth to spend money on this rag. As Gene saw in another review..if people had read this book before the last election he would not even have been on the ticket.  This man is a threat to the life we new when we were growing up.  Already many of us have seen the changes and none of them have been good.  He is a threat, he is a threat, he is a threat...see the movie 2016 and GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE.  I guess it is a good thing that this is my husbands review...I would never be so kind.

0812993292|5.0|I can honestly say this is one of the best books I have ever read and I don't say that lightly. The story starts out so simply, but there's a hint that more lies beneath the surface of this couple and Harold's relationship with Queenie. Each step Harold takes scratches the surface of this man's history and a complicated life story is revealed. One filled with love and joy and friendship and heartache and so many regrets it's overwhelming at times. He has triumphs and failures along his actual journey and reveals those he has lived through along his journey to this point.<br /><br />The depth of these characters is achingly beautiful and Joyce's writing is so crisp and fresh that I found myself slowing down so I could savor the flavor of each word and every turn of phrase. It was such an emotional journey for both Harold and the reader that I found myself laughing and crying right along with him. It's definitely a book I will read again, but not too soon because of the emotional investment involved. It was a truly amazing read.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|This is a great movie! Now, if you're expecting an Academy Award Winning film, obviously this is not the film for you. However, if you want a nice movie that can entertain you for two hours and you like romantic comedies, this movie is PERFECT!!! Chris Evans adds eye candy and Anna Farris is a delight. Better than I thought it would be, and it is a fun concept.

B003E48AYC|5.0|While we have seen this cast in several other movies before, they do a wonderful job in this adaptation in Alice in Wonderland.  The quirkiness of Wonderland is on full display with every character involved.  Some enthusiasts of the original may look at this movie as slightly blasphemous because of the change in tone and situation but I feel the changes are fantastic and well thought out.<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland is remarkably intelligent and witty while keeping the audience ensnared with a complex use of colors to bring Wonderland to life.  It feels like Alice was JUST in Wonderland and has not actually gotten older.  The multiple references to being THE Alice is at first confusing because one would think the creatures of Wonderland would remember her forever.  However, upon subsequent viewings of the movie, one realizes the importance of these references.  The creatures constantly asking if this is the REAL Alice shows their true suspicion and their hesitance to believe anyone that is not known and among them.<br /><br />All in all this is one of my favorite movies currently out there and will probably stay there for a very long time.  I purchased this because I had the movie on my DVR for about a year and a half before it was automatically deleted (which I was quite unhappy about).  I decided then that it was time to simply add it to my collection and the price I paid was fantastic.  I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who watches any type of movie.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I decided not to read this because of the reviews.<br />The 5 star reviews didn't make me want to read it.<br />The 1 star reviews convinced me that I wouldn't enjoy it.<br /><br />I read the first 4 books, and #4 even though it was readable, was not a page turn-er.<br />My advice? Read the summaries of what happens, then find some other author to read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a well written book. It had a great story line. Kept me interested. I could not put the books down. Lost a lot of sleep. It was very sexual and erotic at times but also had a side to it that showed how a person of presteige and passed history of being abused could turn out to love and respect his love.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|It's so hard to find a fantasy series that stands out, and this series definitely does. I loved this world. I love the blending of the ancient greek and medieval English elements. The characters are complex--not boring old good vs. evil. I can't wait to keep reading this series. This world is like nothing I've ever encountered in books, TV or movies.<br /><br />My BF introduced me to this series with the warning that Book 1 was Erikson's first book ever and was somewhat hard to follow. I can definitely see that, but it's almost endearing, especially with the introduction the author added in a later edition. (It reminded me of when I read LOTR as a kid and kept having to flip back and figure out the maps and appendices, since, frankly, LOTR has a lot of hard to follow rambling itself.)<br /><br />My BF also said the books keep getting better, but I think the series has already started out great! I'm very excited to see how the next book is going to be better than this really great Book 1!
072325804X|5.0|One of our best purchases ever! This book is beautiful inside and out. My children love the illustrations and they could listen to the stories all day! We break the long ones up over few nights. Highly highly recommend for anyone with little ones or just a book lover
1476712042|3.0|It's not War & Peace, but it's not supposed to be, so I won't judge it by those standards. Basically, this is just a fun romance story, TOTALLY implausible (in that it's not really true to how people, particularly male college students) truly talk and behave, but a fantasy-type romance in how girls WISH boys would behave. If you like stories about bad boys turning into the knight in shining armor, you will like this.<br /><br />In response to reviewers who thought that the book championed a violent and dysfunctional relationship, after reading the reviews and then reading the books, I didn't think it was as bad as they made out. Yes, Travis has a violent streak, but that's part of his characterization. I think if you are exposed to a diverse group of people - some of whom have 'issues' - this won't offend you too badly. The story isn't particularly realistic, just fun, so I wouldn't want to marry Travis, but I enjoyed the story nonetheless. His dangerous nature makes him intriguing and exciting. It's a nice contrast to the over-fem'd men who are so trendy nowadays.

1476712042|1.0|I am angry with myself that I spent my hard earned money on this book. Within the first chapter I knew what I was in for...a badly written fan fiction. I truly felt that I had stumbled onto FanFiction.net and I couldn't escape. I was only able to make it halfway through the book, then having to put it down for good. I do not recommend this book to anyone. I would not want to be friends with any of the characters introduced and fear that many readers may mistake the abusive relationship of the two main characters as romantic.

Over all though it still works... the story is good enough with live cut sceens to give it that movie appeal and the controls are top notch. moving your character, driving (i use the slider option) feels solid and surprisingly easy to get use to I even found myself swerving through traffic with out constantly crashing or loosing control like on a lot of tablet games that involve driving. unfortunately cars also pop in like the backgrounds but they do such a great job of making the city feel alive with lighting effects and day and night. people talking as you pass them. area's look different... blah blah blah but the real thing is this could have been GTA rio because all the things we've come to expect from sandbox actions games because of the king GRAND THEFT AUTO are here just on a tablet level.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|yes, I really like this cd, it includes all my favorite songs I like.  A few years ago, my friends and I saw this group in concert and it was terrific. This ia one of my friends favorite group and they just love the songs.  The cd sounds like the songs are live from the cocncert and they sound like up close from the stadium.  These songs goes back to the 1980's but they sound great.  My friends have been a fan of this group for a long time and he has collected alot of records from this group.  This is one worthy cd to buy and enjoy.
B007SGM084|5.0|It's rare that you find books so good you read each one anticipating getting to the next one. It's even rarer still that you find books you want to read again right away! From page one of the first book it sets you up for a story so mind blowing that when you finish the first book you almost cry in joy that there is another book to read.<br /><br />EL James Christian and Anastasia are truly everyday people leading normal lives. Or so you think! Ana, young with not so much self esteem, is a quiet young woman with her eyes on a future she has dreamed of for a long time. Christian, self made gazillionaire, thought he knew what he wanted for his life until a young woman, all awkward legs and arms, stumbles into his office and causes him to rethink all that he knows.<br /><br />The mystery of what Christian Grey sets his sights on has young Anastasia who, whirling with a desire she has never felt in her twenty one years of life, can't understand the pursuit an overly handsome Christian. Soon Christian's lifestyle is revealed to Ana giving her pause to rethink just what it is that is so alluring about what he is offering her. Desire soon takes Ana over and curiousity has her wondering and panting to know all of the man that is Christian Grey.<br /><br />For Christian, he struggles with the new emotions this young woman has stirred within him causing him to rethink the lifestyle he has lived secretly for more than ten years. Every woman's dream, Christian can no longer deny his feelings for petite Ana and soon starts to stalk the only woman that has ever sparked a desire so intense he becomes relentless to achieve his goal of capturing and keeping Ana.<br /><br />EL James has admittedly claimed the Twilight Saga written by Stephenie Meyer was her driving force for writing the Fifty Shades Trilogy. Originally a fanfic spinoff of the Edward and Bella characters she wrote under the pseudonym Snowqueen's Icedragon, she put a lot of thought into her original story after many people expressed she should publish her fanfiction. She took her \\"what if\\" idea, changed her character's names and Fifty Shades was born. Writing the trilogy in little more than eighteen months she could not have predicted how the books would take off and become what everyone soon began talking about. It's now common knowledge the series is being considered for the big screen. With much speculation as to who will play Christian and Ana, I truly hope the screenwriters don't try to distract from the highly steamy scenes in the books. Anticipation to see Ms James books made into movies has everyone waiting eagerly on the tips of their toes.<br /><br />I hope Ms James doesn't stop writing more steamy stories. She has captivated millions with her first set of books. I will admit I will be one of the first in line to pick up any new book that makes it from her mind onto paper. For now though, if you haven't read the Fifty Shades trilogy and you're looking for something to keep you interested and entertained, do yourself a favor and pick up this set of books!
1416955070|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I love The Mortal Instruments series! I've read all 5 books in the series and have re-read each book as the next instalment has been released. (Except before City of Lost Souls because I couldn't wait to read it and I've got far too many books on my TBR list!)<br />When I joined Goodreads and was rating the books I'd read, I was so surprised to find so many negative and unnecessarily nasty reviews for City of Bones. Many talked of Cassie's fan-fiction beginnings and plagiarism, particularly pertaining to character similarities to Harry Potter, Star Wars and Buffy, just to name a few.  IGNORE all these opinions (except for mine of course!) because we may as well not bother to read another book ever again, because somewhere along the line you're going to get similarities!! Especially with everyone's love for vamps, shape shifters, fallen angels, the fae etc. Cassie's humble beginnings encourage people like me to take the chance and have a go at writing.<br />So in light of this, here is my review:<br /> Although the story does seem to take a while to get going, you're soon won over as Cassandra Clare gives you one hell of a ride. With action, adventure and drama unfolding, you're drawn into a world with Shadowhunters who have amazing fighting skills and weaponry; angels and demons, travel portals, powerful Warlocks, hostile vampires and werewolves and a hidden country somewhere in Europe, called Idris.<br />I found the characters very relatable and there was such a different variety of personalities to encounter. Clary was particularly relatable, with her teenage angst, her relationship with her best friend Simon and the anger towards her mother; I know I remember those days!  Jace, by far, is one of my favourites, all though he initially comes across as being arrogant and cocky; he has some amazing qualities that are hidden deep down that only Clary and his family seem to be able to bring out in him. Not only this, but he's a HOT bad ass who knows how to kick some demon butt!<br />Cassie's descriptive writing, although tedious at times, was really helpful when trying to picture the intricate fight scenes and the different demons themselves. What a scary imagination she has! She really knows how to paint a scene.<br />There are some predictable twists and some unsuspecting turns throughout the story that keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing constantly. Of course as all good writers do, she leaves you hanging for the next book due to cliff hangers and your unnerving devotion to the characters or namely, Jace. ;)<br />I implore you, if the going gets tough in the beginning, DON'T GIVE UP!!! You'll be missing out on an amazing story that gets better and better as the series goes on.ss who knows how to kick some demon butt!<br />Cassie's descriptive writing, although tedious at times, was really helpful when trying to picture the intricate fight scenes and the different demons themselves.

0783235968|5.0|the video came in its original package but took over 12 days to recieve in mail i would buy more if i could buy from same place so i wouldnt have to pay separate shipping on each movie but the movie was a great movie and came as it said it would enjoy all the movies you can
B004ZG5EYC|1.0|So, this dvd will not play on two different dvd players, nor on the computer's player. Thanks for sending me a blank copy.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I loved this book. I thought it was inspirational, informational and so well written with underlying  humor. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Another great Reacher adventure. Maybe it's just me but Mr. Child makes Reacher<br />a believable character that I thoroughly enjoy. I now have three favorite authors -<br />Child, Patterson and Murcer. Can't get enough of the novels written by all three.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|My wife and I don't watch tons of movies nor get to the movie theaters much.  I was intrigued to read the book and it was so good I was trying not to watch the film before I ended the book.  That ended tonight.  I only had 50 pages or so to go...
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I believe The story is one of the best albums to come along in a generation;Brandi Carlie has the voice of a possessed pixie that spreads her magical dust through every song.with haunting passion there's no one to compare with; from ballads to Appalachian stomps it never fails to. jumpstart a passive heart...the four members of this band are a tight foursome that compliment each other with every note... you have a special thing here Brandi,don't ever forget that.keep spreading that pixie dust!\\"...
1439102430|5.0|Kathy Reichs must be about as lucky as hard work can make you.  She has come up with another great book with Termperance Brennen and this one is a corker.  Situated in Canada most of the time the books starts with a woman who has a baby and hides it in the bathroom cabinet and lets it die.  Later 2 more baby bodies are found and then another.  Nothing can be as sad as a dead baby and 4 of them just break your heart.  Other characters in this mystery are Andrew Ryan and Ollie Hasty both gentlemen have a history with Tempe and she works the case with them.  You will learn about the natives of the area,and also a little bit about diamond mining both of which I was ignorant and glad to learn.  This is a fast paced novel with excellent writing and plot formation.  A good quick read.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|All the you have to do in Ichi is tap the screen to make your way around the levels as you try and collect all the golden rings.  By tapping the screen you'll rotate different objects to help reflect yourself around the screen.  As you progress new features are added like objects that you must phase in/out and ability to draw lines to bounce off.  After completing a level you are rewarded with different letter grades depending on how few moves you made.<br /><br />The notepad visuals are awesome and give the game a very nice clean look.  This is a wonderful game that almost anyone can enjoy.  For just $1 you can't go wrong with Ichi.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|If you want an app that monitors your battery, look no further.  Easy to use, simple to read and free for the downloading.  What's not to like?
1469984202|2.0|All the five star reviews on Amazon for this SF series of novellas had my hopes up.  Way up.  And as I read story one through five they crashed to the down deep.  I know I am in the minority with my opinion but that never stopped me before.  So here is just one avid, hard to please SF reader's opinion.<br /><br />SPOILERS:  I just didn't buy into the world created by the author.  I wish he had added something interesting to the dialogue of how man will survive after the destruction of the world.  And while locating the survivors in silos (like seeds) is interesting, it didn't go far enough.  As a society living in silos would we create a different form of government?  Would we adopt some weird religion or superstitions?  What kind of scientific advancements would we make being forced to live underground?  Instead it seems our lives wouldn't be that different, except we would all be in better shape because of all the stairs and we would recycle.<br /><br />I would think a world hell bent on preserving the status quo would require a more totalitarian approach.  Instead we have a president (chosen by the people), a barely there police department and in lieu of an evil military - we have an evil IT department.  The cleaning seems to be the only way the government has to dissuade the dissidents.  And it takes saying you want to \\"go outside\\" in front of one of the six law enforcement officials (or the head of the evil IT department) or getting guns from Supply and starting an all out insurrection to be sent to die.  Big brother is definitely not watching.<br /><br />And why would the silos want to preserve the status quo?  The mission of destroying everyone and everything else already being accomplished -- wouldn't this \\"new\\" society want to advance itself?  Develop new technologies and scientific advancements?  Expand beyond its containment by either going above ground or building bigger silos?  And yes I know the world outside is toxic, but as a species we are nothing if not inventive.  In the past hundred years or so, we built 747's, rockets that could take us to the moon, and microchips that can store a gazillion bytes of data and now when faced with a true catastrophe we do nothing???  Call me an optimist, but I just don't buy it unless ... insert totalitarian government or fanatical religion here.<br /><br />Also, how is the evil IT department able to keep everything a secret anyway?  The generation that initially went into the silos would be aware of what happened and would pass that information on to future generations through storytelling.  That's how myths and legends come to be.  Not being able to communicate via email wouldn't have prevented information sharing.  (People did actually communicate pre-internet).<br /><br />I guess the problem that I had with these stories is that instead of being engaged in the action and following the journey of the characters, I kept asking myself the above questions.  I really hoped for a narrative that allowed me to suspend belief and instead got one that kept jarring me back to reality.  I wish the author stopped after the first novella and took the time to develop a more interesting world that had more to say about the human condition.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|very fun game but... its exactly the same as world of goo but world of goo is betyer no bugs or anything and theres more lvls
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This was terrible and I would not suggest it to anyone.  Too much hype for a bunch of lonely women, who have not read other entertaining books, that this one seems so SHOCKING.  My own mother read the books and hated them.  Don't waist your money or time on a stupid book that is just porn for lonely women, who have not experienced the life.
B0068TL23G|4.0|Draw lines to connect all the dots of the same colors together.  The idea is so simple yet after spending some time Router you get to see how fun and challenging it can be to \\"connect the dots\\".  Each level scores you up to five stars based on how small you can make the lines used to make all the connections. On some of the levels finding the perfect routes can be quite difficult but its very rewarding once you can figure it out.  There are several levels to play and the difficulty increases gradually as you unlock more puzzles.  I believe anyone looking for a good simple brain teaser will enjoy playing game.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I love this game its so much fun and even though u can by things with real money and if u don't want to it dose not pressure u to. and u can still do every thing. it reminds me of pokemon!:) I toataly  recomend it. but I cant remember how to get out of it plz help!
B006LSZECO|2.0|after rereading the reader reviews of those. This book began really well for me, and I was devouring the book. But then, about 2/3 of the way through, it ran out of steam and I started skimming just to get to the end. It IS twisty at least till I gave up reading carefully, and then it just finished out the formula. By then the twisted (on so many levels) ending didn't even matter to me. Call me shallow, but by the end I only liked two secondary characters (Nick's Mom and sister, Go), and it takes more than that for me to enjoy a book. Glad I borrowed the hard copy from a friend and didn't pay for it.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|i gotta admit one of the best game for the kindle and its FREE but its so hard to gain money to pass lvls ( and ik almost every game in the world is just made for money) but its goin to cost you if u want to do anything without dieing past world 2 other so great game but loses one star from me
0345803485|1.0|I don't like the romance novel genre, but heard this was better (it was not), or at least more interesting(the concept was)  than most.
B0086700CM|5.0|This was one of the first games I got for my Kindle Fire and its been a lot of fun.  All you have to do is run for your life as you jump, slide, and turn around sharp corners.  As your running you try to collect as many coins as possible.  You can use these coins to unlock different characters or power-ups.<br /><br />Some examples of the power-ups you can unlock are the coin magnet and invisibility. The magnet will draw all the coins to you for a period of time while the invisibility will temporary allow you to pass through obstacles and glide over gaps.  Each power-up has several levels you can upgrade.  Upgrading the power-ups can increase their duration, efficiency, etc.<br /><br />Visually the the game isn't too much to look at.  Don't get me wrong, the 3D is really impressive, its just the colors aren't that great and there isn't a whole lot of variety in the environment.<br /><br />All this being said this is a really fun game to play, one that is probably best in short bursts.  Its nice to just jump into a game and see how much father you can get or how many coins you can collect.  There are even different challenges you can go for and you'll be rewarded with permanent score multiplier bonuses for each challenges you complete.
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|WOW! Fantastic actors and they totally delivered. Great, fresh story line. Full of suspense and actually allows you to take this ride with the characters. Giving into the story line and no need to try to figure out what happens next, just letting it unfold, willingly. Top notch make up and fx. Im rarely blown away, especially when you see so much of the same thing in a genre, but this far exceeded my expectations. Would've loved another 30 minutes to let the ending unfold more but would be a good set up for a sequel...dare I say that ugly word.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I absolutely love this game. I got it a few days ago and play it every day multiple times. Easy to play yet challenging at the same time. The only problem is lately it's been freezing. I'll be playing and it'll freeze for about 20 seconds and then continue like nothing happened. Once this issue is fixed I'll be a completely happy with it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is the is the most best thing to do when you have. problems. it helps so much I know.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i use this app all the time. i find it accurate and very complete. Also it was free, what more can I say.
B0055SWM08|5.0|You are a raindrop on a window trying to collect pearls across several decades.  Yes I know, the story is kind of silly but you have to admit its original!  However this isn't a game about story.  Its a game about clever, well designed, puzzles.<br /><br />All you have to do is slide your raindrop across the screen and try to collect all the pearls.  The fewer moves you make the better.  There are several levels to play, each with their own unique challenges.  The game starts with some very simple and easy puzzles, then as you you progress later into the game things can get quite tricky.<br /><br />Quell is a very relaxing game with many well thought out puzzles.  The game looks great and is very easy to learn.  This is one app you won't want to pass up.
B002ZG974M|5.0|2012-09-03
B0086700CM|1.0|ok so the game lie boring I'm sure it amazon would of came up with putting it on the kindle earlier and when it first came out people would love it but right now the game subway surfer is out so stop being lazy and get ur fat butt up and start reading these reviews and c wat tern and pre-teens r interested in and just putting this out here I'm a pre-teen so I know wat to say. get ur fat Butt up and start working. DUMMIES
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|the reason its not fair is because you can only rate 5 stars I wanna vote 10 I love this game but need more levels I beat it in 3 hrs
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this app..best i have.  it helps me keep track of time left on the battery and how long it will take to charge.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This show is hands-down the best TV show I've seen it very very interesting and did have a good storyline to it AQQ on your seat and you never ever know what's going to happen next the people on the show are very very good actors is very believable there's nothing I don't like about the show it has a little bit of comedy to it a lot of seriousness and it's just an amazing TV show. Also it's a good show to watch with minimal commercials and also it something good from side to reality TV show and a TV show talking about nothing but celebrities it's just like real life bills right watching
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have found so many ideas to try.  It is so addicting once you start too.  I only have one problem; when I click to share on facebook it never sends it there.
B005HSL626|1.0|it wont let me play. I played it like seven times and then it froze on me. I loved this game but now I'm so sad that it froze on me.
B0060D0Z0G|4.0|Good watch with the family. We were initially looking for another movie similar and came across this one, we weren't disappointed!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a great way to waste loads of time . enjoy it. the kids will like it too
B0086700CM|4.0|I loved this game until it deleted its self off my kindle and I had to start all over again.
B004RUF9DC|2.0|This movie put me to sleep. The actor who played Jesus looked and acted boring. Was not playing the part as I was not inspired how he would be. Just my opinion. It was not catching my attention. And it was slow. The lighting in this movies was like it was done on dark days.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|[[ASIN:B004MC8CA2 Bible]]<br /><br />I like this Bible app because I can also hear the word when I'm having<br />trouble with my eyes. Not too mention, the daily reminder setting helps<br />me to stay focused and on track about my life and my intentions toward my<br />future goals by including the words of Our Heavenly Father.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Movies are fun, but books are better. This movie is no different. It was neat to see the characters and the setting come to life, but you really must read the books to understand the complexity of the relationships between characters. The film quality appeared low budget and had a somewhat independent film feel to it. Bottom line, the movie is no substitute for the written- read the trilogy, you will not be disappointed. I purchased the books, I would not purchase the film.
B0002XDODU|5.0|The disc was brand new and all components were undamaged.  Great quality and an excellent album!  I recommend this product.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|This album has a pretty cool variety of songs. From the famous \\"Sail\\" to the under-appreciated \\"Kill Your Heroes\\", this album is full of interesting music that will definitely get a foot tapping at the very least. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a slightly rock feel with more focus on vocals than most rock you hear.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Works great on Motorola Zoom 4.1. The music can be turned off by touching the center of the radio in the intro screen.  The game will keep me chasing spiders for a while. Thanks Amazon.
1846074533|5.0|I really enjoyed this book not only because I miss these characters dearly (Ten and Rose) but because I just love the interactions between them. It was easy to read and fast paced and I just loved it. If you're a Doctor and Rose fan (like I am), this book is definitely for you.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Disc looked brand new, packaging was clean and undamaged, and the album is just awesome!!  My recommendations for the product.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I have listened to this album over and over to the point that I know every word to every song. If you are buying this album blind, you should know that there is a good mix of songs ranging from rap to acoustic, and you'll probably love every one of them. Given all of the positive things, I still wouldn't recommend purchasing this album. I made that mistake, and I wish I hadn't. What you should do instead is buy the album \\"+ (The Deluxe Edition)\\" It's the same album but with a few extra songs. It's worth the extra money. Hope I stopped you from making my mistake.
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|I've been watching movies for 60 years, and there's little I haven't seen. For me, an \\"old\\" movie is a silent film (\\"Orphans of the Storm\\").<br /><br />Movie makers seem to think that, despite the wide availability of decades of films on home video, they can get away with recycling stuff most viewers have seen. This is the case with \\"Super 8\\", a rough mash-up of \\"ET\\", \\"CE3K\\", and \\"Jurassic Park\\". Had these films never been made, \\"Super 8\\" would come off as agreeably original. But when all the viewer can do is think of how much \\"Super 8\\" reminds him of //other// films, something is wrong.<br /><br />\\"Super 8\\"'s worst problem is that it depends too heavily on coincidence and obvious foreshadowing. When one of the young film makers displays a proclivity for lighting small fireworks, you //know// it's going to come in handy later. And why is it that the train //just happens// to pass near the community where the man who tries to stop it resides?<br /><br />Spoiler follows.<br /><br />The obvious question of why the Air Force is moving the alien and his paraphernalia is never answered. A plausible explanation is that they're finally going to let him leave. If so, the events of the film are highly ironic. The \\"bad guys\\" aren't quite so bad, while the \\"good guy\\" is the person who incites the tragedy. Had \\"Super 8\\" included this revelation, I'd probably have given it four stars.<br /><br />Michael Giacchino's score is a dud. It comes off as watered-down Williams -- which might have been his intent, a subtle slap at the film itself.<br /><br />In short, \\"by the numbers\\" movie making. J J Abrams should be ashamed -- and ought to take a refresher course from Robert McKee.<br /><br />PS: A note to the costume department... In a film with millions of dollars of special effects, the wig for the guy playing the hippie salesman is incomprehensibly awful. The \\"part\\" in the wig appears to be a part of the wig -- not hair growing out of his scalp. John Wayne had better hairpieces 50+ years ago, and Robert Duvall's \\"do\\" for \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is undetectable (other than looking overly neat), even on Blu-ray. That film had a budget that would've barely covered the catering for \\"Super 8\\".years ago, and Robert Duvall's \\"do\\" for \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is undetectable (other than looking overly neat), even on Blu-ray. That film had a budget that would've barely covered the catering for \\"Super 8\\".
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging and fun game. Enough variation to keep it interesting. This game can be enjoyed by people over quite an age range. Agood amount of fun for ~$1.
B006CS7UXO|3.0|First than anything, I am a huge PSB fan, I discovered them when I was a teenager during their Actually/Introspective years and followed through all these years with their ups and downs. I've been to several of their concerts and I sincerely think of them as old friends. I expected this album anxiously on my mailbox for almost a month and when I finally got it I put the first CD on my player, I was slightly bored at first, and thought \\"Well, these tracks are old, they are from the nineties, it's OK for them to sound dated\\". Then I skipped some tracks and kept listening, but after a while I wasn't just bored: I felt irritated by some of the tracks. I had to turn the volume down.<br /><br />I make electronic music myself, and the lack of work in the tracks shows. Where are the magnificent orchestral arrangements? Where are those spine-tingling chord changes? Where are the clever lyrics?<br /><br />The next day I put CD2 on my car on my way to job. There were some good tracks, but I already got them in my other albums. The rest quickly became background noise. When the album finished, it wasn't with a bang, but with a slight sizzle. It felt like warm beer, not like the champagne I was used to.<br /><br />I can say that Neil's voice is as awesome as always. But that's all. I gave it three stars because they are Neil and Chris, and there's no way in hell I'd give them two stars. But I expect Elysium to be better - I have already ordered it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|great app  long play time when trying to get 3 stars on all levels  cant believe it is free highly recommend
B007USWCXS|5.0|A elderly shoeshine man, whose wife suffers from an incurable disease, rescues a young African boy from capture and ultimate deportation from France with the help of his neighbors and a deadpan local flic. This charming movie, set in the French harbor city of Le Havre, is enthused with humanity, eccentricity, offbeat dialogue, more than a few free glasses of \\"vin ordinaire\\", a hilarious \\"rock and roll\\" jam session out of the sixties and tableau vivant staging worthy of Delacroix or Courbet.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Its a great album from start to finish. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a story told from beginning to end through music . A great hard rocking album for 2012. Rush still shows that they have a lot of gas in the tank. I hope they keep it going. The best rock band ever.  Must have for any new or old fans
0307951529|4.0|If you're thinking about starting your own business, this is a great place to start.  Chris Guillebeau has done a great job of gathering the wisdom of hundreds of small-business owners and compiling it in a way that helps you think through the process and steps of getting started.  It contains good counsel on how to look around you for opportunities that you have the skills to provide solutions for.  He also provides great one-page worksheets for business planning, partnership agreements, product launches and other activities.  Because of Chris' leg-work you won't have to recreate the wheel, instead you can just make minor modifications to suit your needs.  Overall this is a really helpful book and I would highly recommend it.  Between this and Made To Stick by Dan and Chip Heath which I just recently read I've discovered two of my favorite business books.
B007TNQ7EY|2.0|this game does not work every time I turn it on it turns off pleas fix it gameloft..... :( looks cool

031620157X|1.0|The main reason I am writing this review here is because I am tired of hearing only positive things about this book.  I find it misleading and I know that there are many other better written stories for our readers.  Chris Colfer is an actor on the television show Glee, and this book reads like a long drawn out screenplay.  Descriptions are either nonexistent or so basic that my students could paint a far better image.  When describing a cavalcade of knights arriving in front  the twins, Colfer describes them only by saying: \\"Their armor was clean and shiny.\\"  OK...<br />  Colfer puts most of his story in the dialogue and the narration seems to be just a means to link those speaking parts together.  He misses the beauty that can go into a well written narrative.  A story should not leave its reader breaking away from the flow to consider how awkwardly written it is.  Truly though, I could go on and on, and that would be too harsh.  So, here are a few things that bothered me in a (sort of) list:<br /><br />The extreme overuse of poor similes:<br />\\"Mrs. Peters was staring at her as if she had just witnessed a gruesome rural animal give birth.\\"<br />(I couldn't think of a gruesome rural animal...pig, cow, mouse.  Dunno.)<br />\\"Alex clambered up the tree faster than any animal she had ever seen in a documentary.\\"<br />(Doesn't that just flow off the lips.)<br />Compares the witch with the gingerbread house to: \\"...staring at her as if she were a rabid Tyranosaurus rex about to pounce on them at any moment.\\"<br />(#1 rabid T-rex.  #2 would pounce be the best word to describe the movement of a T-rex? #3 the word rabies makes, I believe, 3 appearances.  At least one more I flagged when the twins come upon some unicorns. )<br />The similes go on and on and on and on...<br /><br />Lack of revision.<br />If Colfer spent any time at all revising this novel we would not see the following phrase appear so often:<br />\\"Steam was practically coming out of the teacher's ears and nostrils.\\" pg.75<br />\\"Steam was practically coming out of their nostrils.\\"  pg. 361<br />\\"...Conner said.  Steam was practically coming from his ears.\\"  pg. 164<br /><br />Some of the writing just simply strikes me the wrong way.  Like when Conner sees the gingerbread house on page 112. \\"'Whoa,' Conner said.  'I feel like I might get diabetes from just looking at that place.\\"<br /><br />  Overall, the story is so horribly written that I BEG Colfer's editor to help him make the next book in the series a bit smoother.  The plot of the book doesn't bother me.  I can fall into the most fantastical storyline and believe every line of it.  But that is where the hard work on the author's part comes in.  Colfer must read more to become a better writer.  This is not a script, it is a novel.<br /><br />Go on, tell me I'm wrong.  I can take it.ostrils.\\" pg.75<br />\\"Steam was practically coming out of their nostrils.\\"  pg. 361<br />\\"...Conner said.

B0074MZSWW|1.0|The debut album, Boys & Girls, by Alabama Shakes, didn't do much shakin', in my opinion. Flat and redundant are the words that come to mind. One good song is not enough.<br />I saw Alabama Shakes on the late night talk show rounds and thought they had a strong singer and a decent sound. Perhaps my expectations were too high but the CD did not live up to my expectations at all. Aside from the one song that I heard them perform live, none of the other songs struck me as at least fair, not even after two 'listens' (which were excruciating, I might add).<br />I think they have potential but they need to record some songs with some spirit to them. I didn't feel it, dog. Not at all. Anybody want to buy a barely used CD?

B005LAIHPY|5.0|This movie is righteously a butt-kicking action movie involving the latest technology on the latest Navy ships, and even the old-fashioned, once alien ships splash down in the Pacific right in the middle of a war games exercise involving Japanese and American Navy ships. The aliens target 3 of the destroyers behind a major force field and manage to sink two of them, one of them a Japanese navy vessel. The surviving destroyer, the USS JOHN PAUL JONES manages to pick up the survivors, with only a Navy lieutenant at the helm named Hopper who apparently is on the last legs of his career, but is forced into command when the top-ranking officers of the JONES are dead.<br />While watching this movie, I was thinking, \\"How is ONE destroyer going to fend off this alien force when the other two ships were destroyed without making much of a dent against the attacking aliens and when their alien scouts can't seem to be brought down by gunfire?\\" I mean, seriously, one of the crew had to actually kill one alien by blowing it off the deck at point-blank range with one of the guns of the destroyer. When the destroyer is eventually \\"sunk\\" off the coast of Hawaii(more like destroyed into bits), the survivors, including Hopper, man the decks of the nearby USS MISSOURI, an old WW2 battleship that hadn't run in over a decade, and only with the help of WW2 vets can they pull this one off for a final showdown against the alien menace.<br /><br />Action-packed in every scene! You'll literally feel your eyes burning when you don't want to blink while watching or you'll be afraid you missed something. And the movie critics need to really lay off. I've read their one and two-star reviews and I don't know what it'll take to impress these people enough to make a 5-star rating out of ANY movie because this flick is one of the best I've ever seen and have the honor to add this movie to my already-large collection! You like action flicks? This is the one for you! 5 stars all around!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This game is very fun to play. It is interactive. You play the match three and you win money to spend on your aquarium.  You get to personalize your tank the way you want it. Very addicting game. I can't put it down. Great on the kindle fire.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great app.... love it ........will use again and again in all my aneroid tablets... great app love it no need for anything else
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is very fun. I like how it has a point system so people will keep trying to win.
034580404X|4.0|I started reading the fifty shades of grey, and could not believe the things I read. I must say wow! It kept me thinking whats going to happen next. I understand they want to make a movie out of it. I can see William Levy, and Amanda Seyfried for these parts. I just hope hollywood does not cut too much out of the book. I am not a big book reader, but if books like these continue man I am hooked. Great story line E.L James...
B000OVLINI|3.0|This was another book for my book club.  Not bad but it was not easy reading and not for everyone's taste.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|All 3 books were easy reading. I found them hard to put down and could not wait to get back to them. While the lifestyle was not one I could have ever imagined, I was still riveted, hoping for a happy outcome!
B008EEB4TA|4.0|This CD offers multiple hits. Loved it! First CD I've purchased by this artist and I was not disappointed. Favorites are Primadona Starring role Homewrecker How to be a heart breaker and Lies.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I think the book was good.  It took me out of reality of everyday life which is nice to do at times.  It was predictable but I still couldn't put it down.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Gone  With The Wind is one of my favorite books.  Everytime I read it I learn something new about the  South, before and during the Civil War and about human nature.  Gone With The Wind  is from the view of the wealthy plantation Owner.  This book tells the story of life on a plantation from the view of the slaves and others working for the Owners.  It shows what the slaves did to survive, having no say in any part of their lives, and still showed love and compassion for those around them.  It is a book that teaches us how the slaves survive cruelty and the struggle it was to keep their humanity.  I think this book will become a Classic.  A clip of time that will give readers a veiw of what life was like for those who provided for the priviledge.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you are already a fan of Stephen King, you won't be disappointed with '11/22/63'. King spin a tale of science fiction, history, love, and possibilities. If you've never picked up a Stephen King book before, you will quickly become a fan.

B002OSY2T6|3.0|This is the one plastic, blinky battery-operated toy our 6-month-old son has in his toy collection, and he absolutely loves it. I find it a bit irritating and pointless; it doesn't roll very well on our home's hardwood floors or the rugs we have down and it falls over very easily. But the baby thinks it's amazing and refuses to play with anything else while it's within sight, so we endure the snail for short times every day.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app!!!!''  Easy to use and understand.  K always keep it at my fingertips.  Would highly recommend it to all friends.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is by far the best keyboard I have found for Android OS so far.  My phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) came with a stock keyboard that allowed for either swiping or typing.  The problem with the typing was that it was extremely inaccurate when correcting typed words.  This forced me to use the swiping method which is a lot slower than typing.  SwiftKey changes that for me. Immediately after I started using it, I noticed that I no longer had to go back and correct half of the words typed in because it got the auto-correction right. I haven't gone back to the stock keyboard or any other one for that matter since I installed SwiftKey.
B00466HN6S|2.0|The kids like this OK, but it is not my favorite.  I think the problem is that I really don't like EB.  He is annoying in a not funny way.  It is a shame, because I like the other characters--the cast is great and the idea is funny.  Music is good, but we don't watch it very often.  It is not one the kids ask for, like Despicable Me--the kids want to watch that one again and again.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|This stick is the bomb for the price! A little stiff for my taste had to do a spring mod but it's perfect now!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is such a nice calculator.my husband has an eyesite problem but the numbers are so big he just loves it. he even showed it to our daughter because he was so impressed with it.I would suggest all to purchase it
B007RP4D5Y|2.0|I have been a Metheny fan from the get go, but Unity Band isn't one of my favorites.  I'm glad I bought it, as it saved me $$$ from buying a concert ticket to hear this group.  Chris Potter's sax seems too forward sounding and lacks the subtleties of Brecker.  From reading the other reviews it looks like I'm a minority, but that's why there are 31 flavors.
B005LAIH54|4.0|As an adult woman I didn't think think this was a great movie--but it's great for my kids!<br /><br />The character of Andrometa is a perfect Princess Leia-type roll-model. FEMININE AND STRONG (not a man-hating who-needs-you feminist or bitchy Xena).<br /><br />I liked the messages of Forgiveness and the power of Father-Son relationships.<br /><br />In the first Titans movie there's was anger and rebellion towards Father-Figures. Also, Rape, Infanticide, Nudity. I appreciate the movie-makers tapping into the fact that a lot of kids were interested in this type of movie, just as we adults were in the older version when we were growing up.<br /><br />I will be definitely be purchasing this sequel movie for my kids.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I ran this through this book on kindle text to speech three times, worked great.<br /><br />I found myself at a period of introspection and wanted to know what I could do better in dealing with people. This book really helped me think of a mindset of approaching arguments and expressing concerns.<br /><br />The basics could not be more simple, observation feeling need response. The majority of the book is simply case studies that cover applying these four steps from different angles, be it with mentally disabled children, at risk youths, the arab-israeli conflict, or a long-winded school principal.<br /><br />I recommend this book for bullied schoolchildren, handling irritating coworkers, defusing marital tension, essentially this book is useful for everyone.<br /><br />I've read this back to back with emotional intelligence 2.0, and in contrast this nonviolent communication book is much more anecdotal and from one point of view. This point of view is consistent and well thought out, but my one critique is that it is subjective in this manner.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is one of my most favorite apps ever. it can be a little slow sometimes but overall its really awesome!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I have had this case for over a year now it is wonderful. It has held together perfectly with a year of hard use.

B008XG1X18|5.0|love love love!  I heart this app so glad it's finally here. I have been waiting for it for a long time
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love that there is such a variety of games and that you can open more games by playing (it doesn't cost extra money).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you love mazes and problem-solving games this is for you. It starts out very easy and progressively gets harder as you go, but not so hard that you lose interest. I have enjoyed both the timed and untimed puzzles. Give it a try. It's free so you've nothing to lose. There aren't even all those annoying ads you're subjected to lby most other free games. :)
B000OONQ9O|5.0|This should be seen by everyone. Just a great classic movie that should be put more in the spotlight. Directors edition adds even more value.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this app.  Works great on my Kindle Fire.  I use it every day. Syncs perfectly with my desktop pinterest also.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Good continuation of Matched. Wish there was more in the book, just because I hate waiting for the next book.  Waiting anxiously for the next book to come out in November 2012.
0786956291|4.0|Overall I was happy with the kit, but I was sad to find there was not a \\"Ranger\\" character to play with in the kit.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|IT IS ACTED PACK MOVIE THANKS FOR THE QUIT DELIVELY TO I GOT WHEN THE INVOCE SAID I WOULD GET ON AUG 5 I GOT IT ON THE 4TH
0439023521|5.0|Good reading for those who like adventure storys, looking forward to read the next 2 books of the series now.
B009329ZF2|4.0|The plot is pretty simple, defend against an alien attack. The most impressive thing about this movie is the action and the visual effects. Some pretty good acting, a straightforward story line, and a few good jokes here and there. Wayward bad boy learns how to be a leader, save the world, and of course, get the girl. I liked that they used real navy veterans in the film. I read they used ILM (industrial light and magic) effects, which were very effective. Overall, a great action flick, if you're a fan of sci-fi action, or action in general, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|with the help of the audio feature I have started to enjoy and enjoy the readings.  the only reason I gave it a four star is because it does give me issues sometimes (buggy).
034580404X|5.0|I bought this for my wife, and she enjoyed it so much that she read it TWICE! Must be good.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is the one of the greatest games I ever played. This is also one of the best games I ever had
0738711500|3.0|This product was not what I expected. I was expecting this book to come along with cards. It didn't come with the cards and the book was also slightly damaged. I guess this is what I get when I get a used book. I go this book for my mother and she seems to be pleased with it. She seems to enjoy the book, but did ask about the cards.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Sherlock season 2 was as great as season 1.  Loved it!<br /><br />Wonderful adaptation of the original Doyle characters; but keeps you in suspense because they are completely different stories.  Would highly recommend to both Holmes aficionados and viewers who have never before ventured into the world of Sherlock Holmes.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|It is fun to play with to see where you are on the Street Atlas with with GlobalSat BU-353 USB GPS Navigation Receiver. It is a handy exta to make it easier to find places.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app...the fact that I can mixed up the sounds is the best part to create my own melody! Great work guys!
B0090EIILU|1.0|This movie was not funny at all. I barely even cracked a smile and ended up walking away from it. I should have been paid the $3.99 rental fee to watch it. Do not waste your time or money.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|this app is really convinient for me as a college student because I can look at my notes from any computer or device. I know I'll never lose them because a notebook is damaged or I get a virus. The only drawback is that I can't view things if I'm offline and can't sync it.
B0085A9HXS|4.0|This was the movie I expected.  Lots of action from the beginning to the end. Would have liked to see this on the big screen. will be watching this again and again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Although this series is classified scifi -- it is far more than that.  It does not rely on aliens, spaceships, or outrageous technology.  It does rely on completely believable and engaging characters and a fabulous storyline with a bizarre but understandable setting.<br /><br />Post apocalytpic/dystopian fans -- buy it now.  Not just one of the shorts, buy the whole thing.  It gets better and better as you move along.  Just don't get too attached to anyone...<br /><br />I don't feel like I can write much without giving away surprises that you'd enjoy by reading it yourself.  I rarely give a book 5 stars -- (Stephen King's The Stand gets 5 stars. And now WOOL!)  Wool isn't as huge as The Stand, but it might get there eventually.  I saw on his webpage that Hugh Howey is working on Parts 7&9 (what happened to 8?) and I just downloaded Part 6 to my Kindle.<br /><br />BUY IT!  I am ordering the hard copy, because this book is just THAT GOOD.  I have to have a hard copy in case an apocalypse comes upon us and we lose all power...
B0086700CM|5.0|I just love asking myself if my life is going to service or not it is awesome I really really love playing this game it is awesome
B007L3BMGA|4.0|An easy read which has very explicit scenes which are not for the faint-hearted. Once you enter the world of the characters you become part of their fantasy and develop a strong opinion of what's right or wrong in a relationship. One gets an insight into the effect and power an abuser has on an innocent and naive victim. It's end is unexpected.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is a great calculator for your basic every day use. I like it and recomend it. I love the big screen!
B007OWG3LM|2.0|Like everyone else, I was pretty excited to pick up and listen to the first new Sigur Ros album in four years.<br /><br />I even waited until the right moment to listen to it: On a drive through the forest up in the mountains.<br /><br />It was a lot like setting up a candle-lit dinner for your girlfriend only to find out that since you last saw her, she's become a crack addict. She walks into the door with rotting teeth, stringy hair, and a raspy voice while she picks at her scabby arms.<br /><br />Yes. That's how listening to this album made me feel.<br /><br />I love Sigur Ros. But this album is just the crumbs of the feast that they used to be. The first track just sounds disorganized and directionless. The next few tracks just sound like extremely quiet, overly dramatic rehash of older songs. And the last song is like waiting for a firework to go off, but the fuse just fizzles out and smokes leaving everyone around saying, 'Really? That was it?'<br /><br />A lot of people seem to really like this album, so maybe I'm missing something. But to me, it just sounds like an album of B-sides and experiments. It breaks my heart to have to give a Sigur Ros album only two stars, but I really feel that four years is pretty good amount of time to have done something much better.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|Does what it should do and not a while low else overall good app. Functionality is there so i'm satisfied.
B0089LT8Y6|4.0|I will start by saying I am not a big fan of Testament which might explain the following statement. I loved The Ritual in 1992. I know most fans of this band, as well as the band itself, did not think much of that album. I only own 3 of the 10 studio albums but have heard them all. To me Dark Roots of The Earth is the second best from Testament. It is a solid entertaining collection. It's great to just put on and listen. I am now at a point that I skip two songs but that's not bad. The remakes at the end are very interesting. The Scorpions are my all-time favorite group and the guitar playing on the remake of Animal Magnetism is pretty cool. I also enjoyed the modern edge given to Iron Maiden's Powerslave. Solid offering and I recommend buying.
B000MRA5EM|4.0|The best part of this film were the beautiful views of the corals, sea creatures, fishes, sea stars, nudibranches, and life within the ocean. The film was rather short, and I found the back and forth voices of the narrators to be distracting. However, this makes for a good introduction to a little of the ocean. I am reminded of how beautiful the ocean is. Also, the sounds of the creatures in the ocean was amazing. The music paired with the film could be a little distracting too.
B0001I561E|5.0|I recently purchased the Aladdin DVD. The DVD's came in a nicely packaged box with wrapping to protect it during the travels. My wife was extremely excited about the purchase since one can't go and buy it at a store anymore. The package was also delivered quicker than expected, which is always a nice perk. I would recommend using this seller.
0345803485|4.0|I'm no prude and was not shocked by the actual sesxual experiences described even though I don't practice them myself (or haven't in a while:).  The discussion of e.g., fisting and SM were just that, discussion so no biggie there.  In short, what's the big deal?  The book was a decent read and certainly kept my attention.  Personal discomfort with subject matter does not make a book bad.  And, I've bought the other two in the series so, all in all, I guess I liked it!
B008DVJO8C|3.0|I will not go through each song mindlessly as this collection simply does not warrant it. I knew that ITM could not duplicate Star Crossed Wasteland which had imagination and was a peak for creativity with this band and simply put, very unique and full of effort. The latest offering (studio album #4)is not a bad collection but there isn't anything special that will be memorable. I am about to see ITM live next week and look forward to it but am hoping for alot of tunes from the past albums. Oddly enough, I find the best part of this CD to be the latter half. One song though sounds just like a Kings Of Leon song and another starts of identical to a Stabbing Westward song (too much so). This has been a slow year for music and I would have given this collection 2.5 stars if that was possible. Recommend sampling and buying the tunes you want from it.
B003SHUMRI|2.0|the rest of us in the house, all past the age of fifteen, were unable to sit through this video. I choose the term video because I, using my own standards for the words, would not call this a movie or a film. The screenplay is sophomoric, and unfortunately the actors aren't up to the script's standards. The only bright spot lies in the dancing, which for the genre is better than journeymanlike, and occasionally far better.<br /><br />Watch this one for the dance moves, and fast forward over anything that looks as if it might involve dialogue, emotion, or simple stage presence and movement.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works well.  I use often and reccomend it. I mean, who doesn't need a good calculator?  four more words to 20.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|I didn't get very far playing the game because I couldn't find a way to disable the sound. I'd like to be able to play without disturbing people around me.
B0012HF5NC|3.0|We've been watching the 1996 DVD for 16 years, and it gave up the ghost.  The price was right, so why not get the Blu-ray?<br /><br />PROS:  The visual clarity and detail were obvious immediately.<br /><br />CONS: The menu was nifty, but they never created anywhere for it to go.  It may as well have been an ol' DVD menu.<br /><br />We had to crank up the sound much higher than with the DVD to get the theater experience.  We didn't notice any additional clarity in the sound until we were listening to the music during the credits.<br /><br />From our WHAT THE HECK WERE THEY THINKING??!! department, a minimum of three scenes were cut from the DVD we'd been watching all these years:<br /><br />Judd Hirsch is driving, against the panicky traffic flow, with Jeff Goldblum riding shotgun, when they experience a near head-on collision, forcing them to crash through wooden barriers and careen down an exit.  This scene is absent, with them having a nice Sunday drive, winding up off the highway and on a side street.<br /><br />In the scene at the White House, Margaret Colin's character tells Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch, \\"Don't touch anything,\\" in the Oval Office.  Later, when everyone runs out to attend to the creature, the techs leave Jeff Goldblum alone in the spacecraft, telling him, \\"Don't touch anything,\\" which prompts him to touch every reachable surface.  This comedic moment was cut.<br /><br />While Vivica A. Fox is driving survivors through the rubble, a street preacher (Barry Del Sherman) has this exchange with Vivica:<br />Street Preacher: The end has come! He speaketh his word and the end hast come!<br />Jasmine Dubrow: Hop on! We're headed out to El Toro.<br />Street Preacher: You cannot defy what has come. It is the end!<br />This scene, too, was cut from the Blu-ray.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION:  Get the DVD.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|Most of 2001 a Space Odyssey bored me to tears. That is until the final story. I loved it. Sam Rockwell in Moon tells a similarly eerie tale but with a faster pace. It begins with Sam on a highly automated mining base on the moon. It's so automated, he's the only employee there. He's near the end of his three year contracted hitch when something goes amiss outside. He treks out there in a vehicle to investigate and crashes. Later he wakes in the infirmary, a very HAL-like explains that he'd been critically injured and he needs to rest. But Sam wonders about the wreckage outside. The robot forbids hims to inspect it. Sam slips out, finds the crashed vehicle, and a survivor... himself. From then on it gets wonderfully creepy and a bizarre mystery unfolds.
0062206281|5.0|There is no author whose works I look forward to with as much anticipation as the novels of Zafon.  From the magical and haunting pleasures of his prose to the endearing and often eccentric characters that populate his stories, I savor every page and feel a longing for more in my heart once the final page is reached.  The Prisoner of Heaven is no exception, and I do not feel it is any lesser of a story than its predecessors in this series, but rather one that fills in more of the overall story that binds these characters together.  If you have been \\"hooked\\" by the first two novels in this series, you will enjoy this expansion of the narrative; I loved it.  And now it makes me impatient for the final novel yet to come to bring this full story to completion.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Stumbling around for something good to read, I asked my 20-something daughter for her suggestions. Slaughter House-5 was among them. I'm glad I read it. I won't go into a detailed review; there are plenty of others who do. I will say, though, that this book gives a stark look at the damage war does to its participants. Clearly Billy Pilgrim was affected by what he'd endured, although he was a bit spacy from birth, I'd venture, and perhaps the war isn't the only reason for his strangeness. The Tralfamadore's outlook on time--that past, present, and future exist at one time and events are not linear--is thought-provoking in an \\"imagine the effects of this\\" sort of way. (It may also appear \\"spiritual\\" to those readers who believe in a God who simultaneously sees the beginning and the end of time.) Other Tralfamadorian beliefs left me pondering(which is a good thing for a book to do)and many have a hint of \\"wisdom.\\" I found the twist at the end of the book startling, another thing good books have. Because SH-5 has stayed with me in some way, I give it 5 stars.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book started to unravel like a cheap rug as I tried to read beyond page 117 forcing me to try skimming a head in hope of it improving.... Well it didn't. First the sex scenes and the tongue in cheek reference to BDSM are little more than very bad foreplay at best. This is also the first time that I have read a story that I couldn't care less about the main characters! Christian Grey is in serious need of a strait-jacket and long term care in the best mental hospital his money could buy.  Ana Steele she needs to get a life, one that goes beyond her blushing, chewing her lips and acting juvenile every 5mins!! And what is it with the text messages and emails!!! Just because the tech is there doesn't mean you give it that many pages in a story!! Now I would ask for my money back but since I borrowed the it from a friend( who now REFUSES to take it back) I  left holding a book that some poor tree had to be cut down for. WHAT A WASTE!!![[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]

B000WTNCQS|5.0|These guys DO know how to do a show.. man, pure class.. I hadn't seen an 80s U2 show before.  Apparently they were good then too. ;)  DVD is reason to get this set.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|The DVD starts out with \\"Universal,\\" in nice bright colors - then goes black for 15-20 seconds.  ...  Then starts the previews, which are not all at a constant resolution.  There's black space and about 15 seconds of silence between each preview.  You can fast forward through the previews, but the disk is very slow to respond.<br /><br />Then you **finally** get to the movie.<br /><br />I got up to go to the kitchen & put the DVD on pause.  When I got back, \\"Universal\\" was spread across the screen again.  I could not break out of that.  I tried play, stop, forward, fast forward, menu, etc...  it was like my remote was frozen.  I tried the buttons on my (firmware updated) Samsung BlueRay also - and nothing worked.  So I just pressed the power button.  When I started up the DVD again, I was at the beginning and had to go through all the previews again - though they were different previews this time.  I finally got to the menu and was able to choose the chapter I left off at, and restarted the film.<br /><br />As the DVD got near the end it started dropping out;  the screen would go black for a bit, then come back on.<br /><br />This is a FUN movie.  Not for someone who likes to take things too seriously - but very entertaining.  But if you have an option to buying the actual DVD - take the option.  My experience is that the DVD is very poorly produced.

It has some of the most creative level design, colorful graphics, and best gameplay of any old-school Sonic game. Plus, you can also play through the entire game as Tails!

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was a train wreck.<br /><br />You know how when you see drama unfolding, or supposedly smart people doing stupid things, sometimes you just can't help but watch?<br /><br />Or, when you secretly hope people will get their act together because you almost thing they deserve better than they are getting?<br /><br />Or even when you truly and honestly do not like someone, and you watch just to see if they will spiral even more out of control?<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster was all of those things for me. I hated the main character. Sure, there were times when I almost liked her. There were times when I felt compassion for her. But I despised her self indulgent choices. Having a past doesn't give anyone an excuse to treat people the way she did.<br /><br />And the male lead? I liked him more than her even though he was definitely a volatile fuse waiting to blow. But him I could get. He had a temper problem, lots of people do. Did he go overboard a bit, yes but many people do exactly that. And if it was a book about two average, sane, ordinary people would anyone really want to read it?<br /><br />Still, even with hating the characters and knowing while I was reading that I hated them, I could not stop reading. It held my attention from start to finish and I read it in one sitting. It was positively addicting.<br /><br />The writing was good. Sure a few areas could have been tightened, but nothing jarred me out of the story. I cried a few times, caring about those awful people, so it definitely reached through and made me invested in them, which was a bit surprising considering how much I truly didn't like them.<br /><br />Honestly, after some of the other reviews I've seen on this book, it was a book I was prepared to hate. In the end though, I was satisfied and am glad I read it.

B007MJSYF0|5.0|man. just watched this movie and was blown away. it is ultra violent, intense, funny, and massive in scale. Ive heard many things about this movie so it came with some baggage, but i loved it. thought the dialogue was brilliant, the fight scenes were unreal, the acting was top knotch and overall this movie was a great ride. The dialogue in this movie is probably my favorite thing,.,the kids, being so young, are SO DRAMATIC like we all were at that age.  SO GREAT. Highly Recommend.

B004LWZW24|5.0|I've had this movie in my collection for almost 3 months and was never that complelled to watch it...what a mistake!<br /><br />I just watched it alone in the dark with surrond sound and this movie blew me away.  After 4 decades of watching horror movies I didn't think there was anything out there that could scare me anymore. Boy was I wrong! This movie is Freaky, suspensful, and downright scary in the tradition of the \\"Entity\\", which coinsidentialy also starred Barbara Hershey, mixed in with a bit of poltergeist.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone seeking a good scare and chills. Do yourself a favor and try to watch it with some kind of sound system that includes a subwoofer...You won't be disappointed.

B0052REUW0|5.0|From Black Dungeon of Violence to the Lofty Heights of a Peaceable Era--for Now<br /><br />Many complex life forms have used a life strategy of cooperation, and this has been especially true of socially disposed Homo sapiens.  A theory of mind, moral sense, intricate emotion package, superior forethought--all  , combine to make humans a complex social being  capable of avoiding the zero sum character of violence . Add with these attributes a civilizing process-- and a generous portion of gentle commerce, a dash of democratic government, and a thick slice of Enlightenment ideas through the published word--and one forms a ready recipe for a non violent world. With such, western civilization gradually made humanitarian reforms: gloved fist and blunted foil replaced gladiatorial battle axe; Adlerian therapy sessions for the criminal replaced breaking him on the wheel.  Indeed, although still as wired for violence as ever, the better angels of our nature--empathy, self-control, moral sense, fairness, reason--have overtaken our more negative makeup.<br />  At least, so says Steven Pinker's, much discussed book, The Better Angels of Our Nature. In this stout 800 page book--full of graphs and figures and 200 pages of notes-- he reveals to the scoffer, who suffers from historical myopia, how violence has drastically declined over history.<br />Pinker sets the process out through several sections. After presenting a perceptual contrast between present peaceful times and the profoundly violent archaic times of non-state societies, he examines six major declines of violence: The Pacification Process, The Civilizing Process, The Humanitarian Revolution, The Long Peace, The New Peace, The Rights Revolution.  I will let the earnest reader discover for himself the fascinating particulars and engrossing historical details that Pinker devotes 700 pages, but some important points from the book can be stated and given interesting comment.  I'll begin with a few contributors to non violence and conclude with couple of things that keep it going:<br />*Civilization and the consolidation of central states were important steps toward lessening violence.<br />As civilization emerged, tribes coalesced into chiefdoms and villages grew into city-states.  Rulers, annoyed and hampered by domestic aggression and feuding, implemented their own brand of criminal justice and attempted to monopolize the violence.  Justice, uniformly administered and consistently enforced, allowed for efficient governing while  cutting down the causes of violence--predation, self defense,  revenge.  (These 3 causes come from Thomas Hobbes' book, Leviathan, and Pinker gives a good discussion of these.)  The consolidation of petty states and fiefdoms into central states brought long stretches of relative peace.  These \\"paxes\\" allowed centralized states to build an infrastructure of commerce, finance, and transportation improvements.  Economic systems with smooth operating commerce and trade meant those involved had to give consideration to the intentions and desires of the other.  Certainly, one would not exploit someone he must deal with routinely and expect good business from them. Moreover, these improvements, along with the nationalizing of jurisprudence, made plunder more risky and less profitable than trade.<br />* The Enlightenment and ease of printing was a significant step towards non violence.<br /> Ideas from The Age of Reason and The Enlightenment flourished with the catalyzing effects of publishing.  After Gutenberg's invention of mechanical movable type, printing became easy and books multiplied. Ideas began to spread like never before, and the reader so influenced changed habits of thought and action. On the scene came new or improved forms of literature:  the Montaigne type essay, scientific treatise,  political pamphlet, the novel.  Of these,  notable was the sentimental novel, which became endemic in the age of Reason,  where the captivated reader  might tremble in fear, shudder in disgust, and snigger out loud with  the lead character's experience. Make believe or not, people sympathize with the individuals as the pages turn and the plot unfolds. So, the novel as a literary genre fostered habits of taking others position--perspective taking.  Many came to the realization that folks outside family, friends and community are just like them.<br /> The published word, along with widespread trade, made a variety of views available, and made cosmopolitism prevalent and fashionable. (People noted the cultural values of people east of Christendom).  Soon enough,  Europe witnessed the end of the slave trade, and carried out humanitarian reforms such as the abolition of judicial torture.  Humanitarianism like this required a shifting in moral relational foundations.<br />The effect of cosmopolitism and the influence of the philosophe was a moral trend away from Divine authority and sanctity, while success of the individual and self-sufficiency grew in emphasis. Together with democratic views, the \\"Republic of Letters\\" (as the starring Enlighten establishment were also known) promoted science and the application of reason to all questions. Religious experience and authority was found suspect and it was criticized. Few were atheists, many were Deists, but nearly all harbored an existential worldview which emphasized living and that dismissed concern for the soul and the hereafter.  This emphasis led to a greater regard for the suffering sentient being, and humanitarian reform soon marched onward--ever taking the high ground--reaching the Rights Revolution and beyond.<br />*The cultural morality and taboo structure that guide ethical belief and behavior has retracted from traditional spheres to produce a reduction of violence.<br />Pinker discusses, at some length, Shweder's Ethics, Haidt's Moral Foundations, and Fiske's Relational Models.  People within a culture have universal traits including moral.  Yet, a people's moral repertoire follows a structure that guides the \\"super-ego\\" and molds the mentality of taboo.  It tells one what immoral acts are disgusting and sets what infractions are punishable.  A tribal society from Old Testament times can be examined to illustrate a culture where the moral relational model encourages violent ways--typical of most cultures until recently.  These were a herding people that felt guided by the dictates of a sacred God.  The authority of God and the patriarchal head was held in sanctity as well as the In-group loyalty to family and clan.  These were collective societies, hierarchical in structure, where members were hair-wired sensitive to questions of honor.  Highest regard was given first to the family head, then, the Patriarch's brothers--then his sons.  Considered property and possessing little as far as rights, were the female members of the community.  In Fiske's relational models, this tribal morality structure is labeled Communal sharing.  Their circle of empathy was a narrow one, and if one is not of their kin, violation of moral codes is especially tough and unforgiving.  Wars were chronic and severe and those involved were prone to committing heavy carnage on the outside group.  Presently, the Islamic fundamentalist found in \\"the war on terror\\" epitomizes this Communal Sharing/Authority Ranking model.<br />  Contrastly, there is the modern European society, in Fiske's relational model it is labeled Equality Matching/ Market Pricing/ Rational Legal, where people believe in fairness and reciprocity, and they value the cultivation of kindness and compassion.  Not surprisingly, they find aggression repulsive.  Such societies are feminized (A world without testosterone would be a world that studied war no more.) Moreover, this moral relational model, as practiced by Europeans, place little stock in divine guidance or religious practice.  The world, according to Pinker, is turning into the latter relational model.  America, however, is a blend of several models, though it too is gradually retracting from the traditional spheres.<br />-  Religious morality and political ideology often are deleterious to a peaceful world.<br />Morality and political ideology are packaged in their own scared belief system.  Religion, Pinker suggests, is only partially conducive to creating a peaceful world. Often, it is the reason violence cycles onward. With the sway of religious authority behind them, the believer will see heaven as a paradise infinitely good, and one can justify any means to that precious end.  If it gets the wayward soul to heaven to torture him or massacre his friends, it is worth the effort to do it. If in a war with a heretical or infidel country, one cannot compromise with the enemy because it would risk the chance of getting to the promise land. (So, war goes without end.)  To commit martyrdom or suicide to get oneself and family to blessed eternity is worth the act.  If you look at history, it is apparent that religious zealotry was the cause of many a conflict: religious war, crusaders, heretic abuse, inquisitions, burning at the stake and massacres.<br />Still, ideology has been more than equal to religion in killing and harming people.  The Enlightenment, after the French Reign of Terror, sparked a reaction against it with the Counter-Enlightenment. Rationality was played down while emotion was played up. Political pursuit oriented toward seeking the perfection of man and the building of an utopia, and it was a goal worth everything.  Like the religious zealots, they too desired to reach a heaven that was infinitely good--but, this one on earth.  All persons in opposition were considered evil.  Like the desperate worshiper, it was permissible to carry out any means to reach the goal.  Eliminate those that bar the way but encourage the doubter to believe.  Bloody Napoleonic Wars, Nazi and Stalinist death camps, Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution--all followed counter Enlightenment ideals--all sought utopia.<br />-Any loss of government administration or consistent application of law and order will quickly return a society to a world of violence.<br />One need only to see the anarchy of banana republics, or African countries that, just decades ago, broke from European colonization to see chronic civil wars, coup d'&eacute;tats, and chaos.  Too, when sub cultures, such as criminal gangs, cannot turn to the state for enforcement of law, their isolated territory returns to the days of non-state societies:  becoming rife with predation, preemptive attacks, retaliation and the seeking of dominance over an adversary.  We are wired for violence and it takes little to reveal the devil in our nature.<br />I discussed just a small number of salient points composing the content of his book; but, far from being unsupportable speculation, the thesis stands the test of his evidence.  Indubitably, the book is grounded on data that would interest the serious historiographer, social psychologist, and political scientist.

B003EYVXT6|3.0|There's not a breathtaking amount of originality to Splice, but it is an otherwise solid little sci-fi horror with no real lasting appeal. It's very similar to the incredibly stupid 1995 movie Species as well as having many shades of Guillermo Del Toro's Mimic (Del Toro served as producer on this film too) but plays it straight enough for it to be taken seriously in its own right.<br /><br />Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley play scientists/lovers working for a pharmaceutical company hoping to find cures for various diseases by splicing human DNA with that of various other creatures. They eventually create Dren, a female born from a fake uterus who initially looks like a blind, hairless rabbit. She soon grows arms and eyes and resembles a little girl, quickly after that she looks like a young woman and is treated mostly as a human, mostly.<br /><br />What bothered me about the film is that Dren is frequently treated pretty badly. She cannot talk, instead relying on squeaks and facial expressions, and should be treated like the newborn she actually is. But the pretty poor scientists who created her really ought to be charged with animal/human cruelty. If repeatedly slapping a bad dog with a newspaper creates an unstable animal...<br /><br />Splice doesn't really have many tricks up its sleeve. Vincenzo Natali plays the dead/not dead card way too many times and never really lets us into the mind of Dren. When the movie isn't trying to be a horror its an interesting study of the would-be human development of Dren and the emotions she provokes from those around her. In the end, neither genre defines the film and, like Dren herself, it ends up being a hodge-podge of half-baked ideas.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is in 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras.

The best part - the plot is terrific, too.<br /><br />I don't think Ms. Morgenstern's \\"jumps\\" in time worked as well as, say, Mark Helprin's \\"A Winter's Tale\\", but if Helprin's book is my favorite at a 'ten', this one is a very satisfying 8.5-to-9.

1419703692|5.0|I've seen Mr. Nolan's Batman films many times.  I thought \\"Batman Begins\\" to be excellent, \\"The Dark Knight\\" to be a bit overrated, and \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" to be an absolute masterpiece, the best film of them all and the best comic book movie ever. (I've already seen it three times in the movies, two of the times on IMAX screens.)  This book will tell you absolutely everything you need to know on the makings of these great films: from their origins in Mr. Nolan's garage until completion.  Want to know how they turned that enormous truck over in \\"The Dark Knight\\", head first?  Its here.  Or how they did those explosions on the Pittsburgh football field in \\"Rises?\\" its here as well.  The thing that is so fascinating is how little CGI was used, especially in scenes involving the Batmobile or \\"The Bat\\" in the most recent film.  Every aspect of the Batman films is touched on from beginning to end.  Loaded with tons of pictures, this is an absolute must for the Dark Knight fan.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|After all of the 5 star reviews this book received I just knew that I needed it for my classroom.<br /><br />Now I just wish that I could return it and get my money back as I was very disappointed in this book.  I did enjoy the characters, but that is about where my enjoyment stopped.  Most junior high students won't be able to read this and get all of the meaning without keeping a dictionary handy.  I used context clues to figure out what the words were meaning, but still didn't know on some.  I didn't feel that all of the events in this book were appropriate, and I never grasped the character infatuation with the book they loved that the whole story revolved around.<br /><br />I have the book, but I won't be suggesting it to the majority of readers that pass through my classroom.  :-(

0553805371|1.0|I usually refrain from judging any book while reading it, but this was something very, very hard to do with this one. From the start, Hawking comes up with considerations that cannot be taken seriously, only as a product of malice or profound ignorance. Particularly revolting is the ridiculous first page statement that philosophy is dead, in opposition to science, which I would expect only from someone with a lack of comprehension of the nature and scope of both.<br /><br />The model-dependent realism of Hawking is the consequence of cartesianism taken to extremes. Modern science carries with it the hidden premise of the res extensa and res cogitans dualism, which simplifies things a lot by separating the knowing subject and the object to be known. Descartes himself used a very tortuous argument to solve this rupture, in the end resorting to a benevolent God that wouldn't deceive him. Modern scientists not only throw away this solution and never replaced it, but also from the moment they faced quantum phenomena with an undeniable link between knowing subject and object, they've tried to hammer down those phenomena into a number of models where they don't have to give away that hidden premise, with conflicting results and different degrees of success. To solve these conflicts while keeping the successes, Hawking proposes that we simply embrace them all together, assuming that their confusion reflects the fact that our grasp of reality itself is confusing and can't be truly known, and depends on the model being used to study it.<br /><br />Obviously, this confusion is caused by the hidden premise mentioned above, and does not reflect a confusing reality. Once that premise is throw away, reality is clear, but it has ideological consequences most scientists aren't ready to accept. Modern science has become an epistemic dictatorship where it claims to be the final judge of reality, but those claims ultimately rest on a hidden premise that's assumed on blind faith.<br /><br />That's why the book feels more like an attempt at rhetoric than a scientific presentation. From the onset, it's clear that the authors are not presenting a clear demonstration or even the mental path they did to reach their conclusions, but just trying to convince the reader to give up on the possibility of any real knowledge. The reference to the Game of Life is an obvious example. That can't possibly be presented as anything but a rhetorical argument on the anthropic principle. Hawking went all the way down to the level of Richard Dawkins and his Weasel program presentation with that.<br /><br />When we consider how we ended exactly in the same solipsistic dark room Descartes started, it's a real joke to see someone then using cartesianism to say how God is unnecessary. To see this nonsense formalized in such a pretentious way is a qualitative leap beyond the concept of epistemic closure: Hawking is no longer losing sight of an arbitrary limitation of scope, but seeing that limitation as reality itself. He's the fruit worm who thinks the whole universe is a fruit.<br /><br />If the emergence of quantum mechanics somehow forced scientists to become philosophers again, and they are still struggling with that, Hawking makes a good example at how it shouldn't be done. For a reply from a physicist who is a lot more competent with the philosophical issues at hand, read Wolfgang Smith's article Response to Stephen Hawking's Physics as Philosophy, as well as his books, Quantum Enigma, Science & Myth, Cosmos & Transcendence and The Wisdom of Ancient Cosmology.

B002K0WBXW|2.0|Margaret (Sandra Bullock) is an aggressive executive in a publishing firm, about to be deported back to Canada because she violated the terms of her visa.  She tells her astonished boss and a very skeptical INS agent that she is going to marry her assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds, a very engaging actor), a dogsbody whom she bullies and overworks.  He thinks fast on his feet and extracts the promise of promotion to editor as a condition.  Then he takes her home to meet the family.  In Sitka, Alaska.<br /><br />Up till then it was passable, although where have we heard this premise before?  But then it gets so formulaic and silly, it was barely watchable in spots.  The scene where the two actors accidentally get tangled up together stark naked was stupid and cheap.  Betty White is always a joy, and I'm glad she's getting work; but you could see how they used her in this.  Of course Margaret softens and becomes lovable, and of course Andrew falls in love with her.  Why, is not exactly explained.  Reynolds was 33 when this was made; Bullock was 12 years older and looked it.  It would have been a better movie if the writer had made a point of it, I think. You know, wasted her youth on her career.  Sort of like Bullock's having wasted hers making too many films like this.  Remember the chapel scene in While You Were Sleeping where Lucy (Bullock) stops the ceremony and confesses that she's been deceiving the groom's family?  Yup.  She does it again.  The really irritating thing is that they thought we wouldn't notice, or if we did, it didn't matter.  The expendable, disposable audience. Bullock was a producer of this and frankly I'm turned off by this dame's gimlet eye on profit.<br /><br />There's no accounting for taste, and I know I've loved some films many others hated.  But some of these 5-star posts are just bewildering.  \\"The chemistry!  You can just tell these actors like each other so much!\\" Well, why shouldn't they like each other?  And even if (for some reason) they loathed each other, do you really think we would know?  It seems to suggest these actors couldn't act if they had to.  A number of posts mention the gorgeous Alaska scenery.  I mean, I've never even been to Alaska and I knew at once that house was not in Alaska.  How easy it is to fool people, after all.  It makes me feel jaded, that's what.<br /><br />I won't rent this film again.  I'll certainly never buy it.  But if it came on tv some night, even without commercials, even if there were nothing else on, would I sit through it again?  No.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|You can complain all you want about the adaptation aspect of this book into movie but when you lay down the difficulties the filmmakers faced in adapting then the decisions they made are pretty apparent in their necessity. Yes there are pieces of the book that are left out or abbreviated (the cave scene, which I felt too long in the book anyway) and yes the tributes deaths are much more graphic in the book but if they'd have shown the gore the book does this film would have been sure to have an R rating. So leaving behind all that, why does this movie work so well? Beautiful direction, superb acting, emotional depth that is hard to find in movies these days. All these pieces culminated to a movie that punches you in the gut. The scene at the beginning where Katniss volunteers almost had me crying right away and they also manage to make Rue's scene into an emotional climax despite others saying her part is too short, they make it have depth by introducing her with more prevalence early on. I went from being hesitant about these adaptations to really looking forward to seeing how they deal with Catching Fire.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it is absolutely perfect and I love it. I use it for school and love it.  its a must have app.

145162445X|4.0|This is really two books: the first one is a historical narrative of cosmology, especially the last 100 years. As a science professor (neuroscience) I greatly admire and value a teacher's ability to explain complex concepts. In this regard Krauss is as good as they come. I learned a lot and enjoyed that book tremendously. It is a cosmically fun ride.<br /><br />The other book are the author's musings about God (especially God as a cop out), and theology. The problem is that the author so lacks sophistication and understanding that the product is really beneath contempt. People could fairly ask for my reasons for this judgement, which would amount to asking for a review. But some material is not worth reviewing. It should be sent to the student with a \\"try again\\" or perhaps an F. At any rate, people with the author's kind of \\"open mind\\" are very refractory. The man spends his life trying to understand nature and fails to find evidence for God. Try looking for God for 30 years and see if He finds you.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Purchased this after seeing a live performance earlier this month.  The show was terrific, and the CD every bit as good.  Sounds even great on my Panasonic stereo radio player.
B002FGU46W|4.0|These replaced a 17 yr old pair of Teva Teradactyls. The soles were beyond fixing, they had that permanent sunken foot shape that eventually comes to all soft comfortable footwear.. They were simply broken-down. Those amazingly comfortable sandals were great 80 lbs and 10ish years ago & I loved them dearly, but they hurt my feet & knees. Which leads me to one of the often complained about features of the Teva Terra Fi 3 sandals, the Shock Pad.<br /><br />If you weigh 100-140 lbs and have little to no issues with your feet or knees (at this time), then you wont notice until much later in life how ruined your feet and knees are due to the cheaper, softer, and often flat footwear you wore for most of your life. And when you have to start wearing firm supportive footwear, you will probably complain like so many people here do about the Shock Pad. I weigh 235 lbs, have alignment issues with my feet (I over pronate) that cause issues with my knees and cause plantar fasciitis. These sandals are firm, and a bit stiff like all new footwear (until you wear them for a month or so). The shock pad does not hurt my feet. In fact the purpose of the shock pad is to overcome past performance issues such as sunken heel & to help distribute the weight that the heel places onto the sandal. I have worn them for several months now, and I am happy with the replacement. Sandals are not something that should be worn all the time, but when you do wear them these are so much better than some flatwear or soft slipper type open shoe.<br /><br />I don't intend to sound \\"preachy\\", but these are sports sandals & they should durable & supportive - not soft. I think a large portion of the people who complain, have issues with their feet that they are unaware of and should find out whats wrong with their feet before more serious issues arise. I have been through this myself the last few years and have taken many steps to correct the problem. Upgrading my old sandals is the latest.<br /><br />They arestylish, have some arch, are firm offering more support, & have the same velcro strap system of my previous sandals. I am considering buying a second pair for the future.

B0083H6AQA|5.0|This was a very good and interesting movie.  It showed the power of the women in this time frame but unfortunately it showed how easily the women could be swayed when confronted with a handsome convincing man.  It also showed how a person can be changed by money, influence and power.  Robert Pattinson did a great job and truly showed his acting ability.  He proved he can be a well rounded actor.  Uma Thurman and Christina Ricci were very convincing in this movie and showed they are truly well rounded actresses.  I would recommend this movie but because of all the sexual content I would home parents would preview the movie before allowing their children to watch this movie.

0345803485|1.0|\\"...All the women who swoon over Christian Grey and think this book is romantic and steamy...I worry about you. I worry about the teenage girls who undoubtedly also read this and get all swoony over it, then end up in abusive, toxic relationships themselves, thinking they've found their own Christian Grey. And you know, if the BDSM thing actually is for you, and if it actually was something Ana could get into, the relationship probably would have been pretty okay. But under no circumstance was anything that went on between them actually okay. Consenting begrudgingly because you are afraid the person will leave you if you don't is NOT the same as actual consent.<br /><br />I'll admit Grey had his moments of being charming and likable. But that doesn't make up for the rest of it. I have nothing against the BDSM lifestyle. Between two adults who both understand and consent to the details, it can provide an exciting and erotic aspect to their relationship. But when one person doesn't really get it and thinks it's some kind of phase he can be therapied out of, and the other person is an overbearing, possessive stalker, the relationship is not at all healthy. It wouldn't be healthy if the BDSM were not a factor, and the BDSM doesn't make it suddenly acceptable.<br /><br />I find it amusing that so many people got riled up about this same behavior being exhibited by Edward Cullen toward Bella in the Twilight saga - getting jealous about other guys, warning her against spending time with him, sneaking into her room at night to watch her sleep...but when it's Fifty Shades of Grey, it's suddenly ideal romantic behavior.<br /><br />And speaking of Twilight? I dare you to read this book and not get the sneaking suspicion that this is actually fanfic, rewritten so it could be published without a lawsuit.<br /><br />If civilization is really going to come crumbling down at our feet this December, then I am taking this book's best-seller status as one of the signs of the coming apocalypse. I don't believe I'll be subjecting myself to the rest of the trilogy if it's all going to be like this.\\"<br /><br />For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:<br /><br />[...]e subjecting myself to the rest of the trilogy if it's all going to be like this.\\"    For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:    [...]

0451450523|5.0|I remember watching this cartoon as a kid, and wimp that I was, having tons of nightmares about Mommy Fortuna.  That was one scary bi-atch!  Still, fond memories abounded when I came across this book, and I was very excited to read it and see how it matched up with my childhood recollections of the story.<br /><br />I came away with this:  This is no children's fairy tale.  You need to be an adult to fully appreciate everything this story has to offer.  Aside from it being beautifully written, it contains numerous thought-provoking themes, my favorite one being the nature of a hero. (Love that Prince Lir!)  This tale is full of humor and sadness, hope and despair, and of course, regret.<br /><br />Despite its short length, it took me a long time to read this book.  Not because it was boring, but because I found myself going back so many times to re-read a certain line or paragraph.  The dialogue is wonderful - here are some of my favorite lines to spout from the characters' mouths:<br /><br />\\"Of course you are right. She is here, they are all here, and whether they mean my doom or not, I will look at them for a while.  A pleasant air of disaster attends them.  Perhaps that is what I want.\\"<br /><br />\\"The prince is very brave to love a unicorn.  A cat can appreciate valiant absurdity.\\"<br /><br /> \\"I have time,\\" the skull replied reflectively.  \\"It's really not so good to have time. Rush, scramble, desperation, this missed, that left behind, those others too big to fit into such a small space--that's the way life was meant to be.  You're supposed to be too late for some things. Don't worry about it.\\"<br /><br />\\"The happy ending cannot come in the middle of the story.\\"

145162607X|4.0|While I enjoyed this book and found it to be a solid entry in the Cousins War series, I would rank it third, behind The White Queen and The Lady of the Rivers.  Some annoyingly clunky sentences and a couple of typos that any editor worth their salt should have caught stood out for me.<br /><br />The author mentioned in the author's note that her favorite character of the period is Elizabeth Woodville, and I feel like this book suffered a little due to the fact that Elizabeth Woodville is the most consistent villian, rather than the heroine.  Perhaps the author had a hard time really believing that she was the villian?<br /><br />Some reviewers have mentioned that they found the story to be repetitive, rehashing ground already covered in the series.  Since I am familiar with the events covered in this series, of course I found the progression of the book to be predictable, but I enjoyed seeing the scenes from the perspective of another character.  Towards the end of the book, I even found myself cross referencing several scenes that also are covered, very differently, in The White Queen.<br /><br />One element that kept me from enjoying the book more was Anne's naivete.  She did keep a very childish viewpoint throughout the story.  First characters are bad and do bad things to her, then they tell her that they are good, and she unhesitatingly believes them, even though their prior actions should make her think twice.  Anne's shifting view of who her enemies are makes the author seem to be vacilating between historical theories.  Ultimately, the authors lack of commitment to a solid historical theory left me feeling rather unsatisfied by the book.  Anne didn't mind not getting enough answers, but I felt the lack.<br /><br />As far as reviews comparing this to The Virgin Widow [[ASIN:B0058M7Z1C The Virgin Widow]] go, I found this book to be vastly superior.  The Virgin Widow prematurely ends to give Anne an artificial happy ending, while The Kingmakers Daughter carriesevents to their actual conclusion.
1400052181|5.0|As a biology student I used HeLa cells in my experiments in an immunology lab.

I have heard many different improvisations but very few come close to this amazing originality and depth.<br />We all know there are many great pianists and vocalists out there who have great qualities and some of them are even quite original. However in particular in regards to style, experiments and music character I believe (and others may differ) she is one who stands out.

B007Q1VUFA|2.0|When I first put this album on and heard \\"Tulsa Yesterday\\", I thought I was going to be in for a treat. However, as the album progressed, and I kept hearing guitar licks that were teases of Grateful Dead tunes (listen to the beginning of \\"Tulsa Yesterday\\", and you can hear \\"New Potato Caboose\\"; and, I can't remember which song, but there's Jack Straw in there as well.) Then I got to the cheesey generic jam band groove of \\"Rosalee\\", and I find it pretty hard to go any further, although I have.<br /><br />I love Chris Robinson. I have everything by the Crowes, and his solo stuff is among my favorite of his music. I've seen the Crowes multiple times, and I've seen him with Phil and Friends, all great stuff. When Chris was touring with Phil, I read an interview where he said something to the effect of the limits of jam bands and that music and scene. There was definitely a market there for Chris, and I think he finally relented with this outfit.<br /><br />I am a Deadhead, although I would not call the Dead a jam band; it's too generic of a term. But, I can't get into this album no matter how I try. But, if you think 15 minute guitar solos alone constitute \\"jams\\" and time well spent, and if you like Widespread Panic, Moe, String Cheese, and any number of generic \\"jam bands\\", this album is for you.

I will be purchasing season 1 thru 3 from amazon in the future. No more losing discs or worrying about scratches. Watched it several times. Only complaint to amazon on video players the delete is way to close to play that you have to be very careful not to delete...maybe that can be fixed.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had a hard time putting the book down. It was all I could think about at work was to figure out what was next. Book one was probably the most educating and surprising. Book two was entertains and book three was just a story. Probably my least favorite of the series is three it lost its hook well say. But I'm glad the books are mine so I can go back and read them whenever I'd like.
B008N1LL42|2.0|What was Liam Neeson thinking?  One of the worst movies I've seen in recent years, as bad as Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon, and very similar special effects to that movie.  Only saving grace that it was so bad -- like the part where they are shooting on a grid system to imitate the board game Battleship -- that it was funny, much in the way Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness are so bad they can be enjoyable.

B008GOAFBQ|2.0|Well - after waiting for what seemed like a lifetime to get this disc, what can I say about it?<br /><br />Firstly - I'm like many reviewers here...old and very biased. I got into Kiss back in '78, so vinyl was the king back then. I wish it still was...just so we don't have to keep buying new formats to play stuff...at least digital seems to be a more consistent and future proof method of delivery!<br /><br />Anyway...I've been suckered yet again to buy sub-standard KISS product!<br /><br />The promise was amazing...a revisit to a classic album to tweak things to how they should have been. Great idea. Perhaps some unreleased stuff too? Even greater!<br /><br />What do we get?<br /><br />Digital copy-paste of chorus vocals on DRC - shabby<br />The fixing of Paul's \\"Down\\" to \\"Doin\\" on DRC - WTF?! Terrible, just terrible! Not because it's sacred, but because it's just SO OBVIOUS and badly done.<br />Missing beats on Flaming Youth - shocking<br />Newly-discovered Ace solo on Sweet Pain - terrible...what was he ON when he played this (and I'm an Ace fan) - and the track's in the wrong place on the disc...it's not the actual bonus track...which threw me as I played what I thought was the bonus track first and wondered: \\"there's no difference\\"!<br /><br />There are some good points - the mix of drums/bass suits this release very well - you can hear more clearly why Pete was cursing Bob now!<br /><br />So what was missing from this release?<br /><br />How about demo versions of all songs, plus unreleased songs -<br />Or how about the supposed band fool-arounds at the end of the songs?<br />Or do we wait for messrs Stanley & Simmons to release that later as a super-special edition (\\"Now with Fixed Flaming Youth Beats\\").<br /><br />Tie that lot in with a couple of Destroyer-era DVDs as a mega-special set and Gene could well sucker me into buying it all over again (more fool me!).<br /><br />I'm seriously considering cancelling the SHM-CD that I ordered at the same time from Japan that has the mini-LP style to complete my KISS SHM-CD set.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm glad I didn't cancel my Japanese SHM version of this - the Flaming Youth has no error on it. Not that I bought it only for that - it does complete my set of SHM CD vinyl replicas...!

B008M34INW|4.0|Basically blacklisted by Hollywood for his reprehensible anti-Semitic utterances, Mel Gibson has decided to continue his movie career without the support of the major film studios (this movie was not released theatrically in the United States). In Get the Gringo, this has resulted in a film with an over the top, not holds barred violence that would almost certainly have been toned down if released by a major studio.<br /><br />Gibson is an American (his real name is never given in the film) who is captured by the Mexican police when he is fleeing American authorities in a car chase along the border. With two million dollars in the car. He is send to El Pueblito, a prison that seems more like a third world slum market hellhole than a place of incarceration. The prisoners live among their families in slum housing conditions, and there is a big square inside with market stands. Of course not every prisoner is equal - basically the prison is run by the top gangster Javi, the prison warden being an employee of him. While learning who's on top of whom, he makes two friends in the jail, a ten year old boy - to whom he gives a cigarette (the kind of scene unlikely to be released by a major studio) and his mother. He learns the little boy has a very important personal grudge against Javi, which helps him plot his next moves. I'm not going to tell more about the plot, but it involves very violent goings-on, including an over the top Peckimpah-style shootout in the prison plaza.<br /><br />Some might criticize Gibson for making Mexico looks very bad - though nothing here shows the brutality of the present drug war there - yet the American characters are not very good either (the most likable characters in the film are Mexican, the 10 year old boy and his mother).<br /><br />For its style and good storytelling (the director is Adrian Grunberg, in his movie debut; Grunberg and Gibson co-wrote), I recommend this - though it is obviously not for everyone.

B000I0QM04|3.0|The first machines appeared about three years ago.  They were huge frightening things; the only reason you haven't heard of them is because they had restricted their looting to remote regions; that is, until Friday, when the whole world learned of their existence, beginning with New York when squadrons of giant robots flew overhead, landed in the streets, crushing cars as they marched, and tearing up the pavement searching for underground goodies.  The police's firepower was no match for their armored skin; it was time to call in the Sky Captain to save the day. . . .<br /><br />Overall feeling: disappointment.  The designs of the various robots and flying machines are interesting, but the disjointed script and inattention to continuity ruined it.  For example:<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, a scientist, aboard the Hindenburg III, mysteriously disappears just as the zeppelin ties up to the Empire State Building;  the newspaper covering the story is dated 7 October 1939.<br /><br />Later, when six-story-high mechanical cyclopes, each emblazoned with an emblem of a winged-skull, dig up and steal New York's generators, the newspaper covering this story is dated 17 March 1939.<br /><br />And still later, when Joe and Polly are flying over the Pacific, Joe needs the date so he can look up the location of a star he is using for navigation; Polly tells him the date is 2 March (1939).<br /><br />Apparently, in this alternate universe, time runs backwards. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray): 2.5 to 3.  While there are some scenes or parts of a scene that are sharp enough to show significant detail, most scenes are blurry, fuzzy, and nearly colorless with a brown sepia tint; it looks like an old black-and-white movie that has been poorly colorized.  Measured Aspect Ratio as: 1.78:1.  Languages & Subtitles: English, French, and Spanish.

B005LAIGQ4|4.0|Right off the bat, 'Big Miracle' could have been a ham-fisted environmental propaganda piece.  Instead it's a well-told reinacted story:  not over or under done, touching our heart strings with every individual and party having their own side to tell.  At first, the centerpiece is the plight of three whales stuck in the ice with the temperature and their life chances dropping by the hour.  In the details are the improbable true-life deliberations of saving those whales.  But the heart of the matter are people with their own agendas, feelings, and motivations.  The movie does a smart job of focusing on each of them and what they each do, say, and feel.<br /><br />It is a true story, of course, and it all starts when an Anchorage reporter and anchorman (Krasinski) spends some time doing a human interest segment in Barrow for his local TV station.  It is by accident while shooting a young Inuit's friend doing snowmobile stunts that he discovers a displaced whale surfacing in what looks like an ice fishing hole.  As true-to-life coincidences go, his ex-girlfriend (Barrymore) works for GreenPeace, the environmental civilian force who police alleged wrong-doers on many fronts, and she becomes the prime mover for saving these whales.<br /><br />As you might expect, the story goes from the Local Hero to a hot national and then international news item.  The ramifications are also national and international as it involves an oil executive (Danson), the military (headed by a colonel [Mulroney]), and The President and Vice President (who are doing everything to shore up the latter's election).  Among the center of the ice storm is the Inuit (Eskimo) community who simply preserving their traditions and their livelihood.<br /><br />What I liked about the film is how well they pace their story, while they briskly take any and all the story components without confusing a family audience.  The actual news footage (done since the likes of 'Forrest Gump') is enriching, and their portrayals are wonderfully solid.  No one is close to being an Oscar contender, but the energy, personality, and the genre of this movie make you glad this is the case.  Rachel, the environmentalist, may have us on her side with her cause, but not always on the side of her character.  The oil executive may be in it for the PR, but Danson and the script keep it honest without having him twirl his moustache like a cardboard villain.<br /><br />At times funny, but nearly always engaging and fair-minded, 'Big Miracle' is a fine family movie that takes an interest in human hearts and achievement as much as it does with its environmental message.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|This book was a real eye opener.  I really enjoyed it and find this Plant Based Diet to be extremely beneficial to my health. I highly recommend it.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|The story was falling apart bit by bit as it went on to the point of seeing how ridiculous and unbelievable it could get was more entertaining than the movie itself. And how can you call this a Batman movie when he is only in the movie for 20 minutes at most? It's a 2-hour 40-minute movie which could have easily been cut shorter. And they ruined the Bane character with the final reveal of the mastermind, also the way he was killed just made him look like a joke. The fight scenes are some of the worst choreography I've ever seen in a major blockbuster. Don't get me wrong, it has some great scenes like the first face-off between Bane and Batman, how Brcue Wayne eventually climbs out of the pit. The score was loud and really gave the movie an epic feel. Anne Hathaway's Selena was the standout character, very cool and sexy. But all these cannot even make up a decent movie.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I believe that women should have a higher opinion of themselves than allowing anyone (man or women) to manipulate them mentally, physically or emotionally.  This book was a throwback to times when women got off on men being occasionally nice to them but always in control of them.  Thankfully times have changed - the book made me sad!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really fun game to play. I recommend it to all my friends. Great way to sharpen your skills.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a Rush fan since the 70's. I tend to enjoy the 70 & 80's Rush albums ( although I admit to not listening to all of the newer ones). I bought this to hear if the band has got more of that \\"rocket sauce\\" left. Well, the answer is YES ! Much better than I expected, cool riffs, awesome musicianship and songwriting. If you're a Rush fan, you've got to own this!

1606995359|5.0|So many times when publishers release a much-anticipated series, whether a book or dvd, the first volume receives more praise, (and, on Amazon, more reivews), than subsequent volumes. The first book in this series - Donald Duck: \\"Lost in the Andes\\" was fantastic, but, in my opinion, this one has an even better selection of Carl Barks' stories, possibly the best they'll be able to put together! (see other reviews for the list of stories in the book)<br />I am a 5th grade teacher, and I have purchased multiple copies of this book to use in my classroom. My students have been tearing apart my personal comic collection for over 15 years, as each new class eagerly devours the duck stories. These durable, affordable, colorful books, with multiple, long stories in them, are just what I have been wanting for over a decade! Can't wait for \\"A Christmas for Shacktown\\"!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted to Pinterest and this app is fantastic! I love being able to access and pin items quickly on my Kindle Fire! Great app!!

I initially downloaded the free version and rarely buy apps or books for my kindle fire however this wad a rare gem and well worth it. I use it at night and during the dsy. awesome!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A little explicit but entertaining. I couldn't stop reading it. It took me 3 days to read it. Informative I will say that ;).<br />If you don't like romance novels then this isn't the book for you!!
B001AUKUS6|2.0|I bet when Ratt coined their album 'Invasion of your privacy' all those years ago they never imagined the term would become so popular years later, meaning many things to so many people! Of course, back in '85, these guys were just looking at girls.<br /><br />But when listening to this invasion of privacy, it seems that there isn't much meat on the bone. They get that 80's party rock beat, anthemic chorus, guitar solo, and very lean on the songwriting.<br /><br />The opening 'You're in love' is an excellent rock anthem with great riffs, 'Lay it down' is a very good song, and 'Between the eyes' is different enough to be interesting.<br /><br />Apart from that, the songs aren't bad, but there is very little depth in the songwriting, just chugging out that stadium sound and shifting the units.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|The story intriguing, the performers st their best, and the movie simply fun. You can't go wrong when you add this DVD to your digital library.

055380684X|4.0|I checked this out based on a recommendation from my professor, a lifelong educator who's deeply immersed in the field of leadership and organizational development. He stated, on no uncertain terms, that this was a great read on talent development. Not just talent in one area, ALL talent.<br /><br />The central premise, which is repeated for effect throughout the book, is that \\"skill is insulation that wraps neural circuits and grows according to certain signals.\\" That insulation is a substance we learned in high-school biology called myelin. Building myelin allows impulse circuits to fire more precisely, more quickly, and more consistently, all of which contribute to skill improvement. Practice and repetition are crucial to this increase in myelination activity. Instead of focusing on genetic and environmental factors, Coyle proposes that we think of skill development as a muscle and an exercise in building myelin. The book focuses on three crucial elements that allow people to develop their skills and become experts in a wide range of fields, from sports to music and art:<br /><br /> Deep Practice  - Repetition is important, but Coyle explores what it means to practice effectively - through focusing both on the small details and the big picture, and by actively utilizing failure as an opportunity to improve. One of the best examples in the book is provided early on, dubbed the Girl Who Did a Month's Worth of Practice in Six Minutes. Just like a baby taking its first steps and falling, skills are developed much more quickly through doing and failing, attending to mistakes, and trying again. A really good quote in this section from Samuel Beckett: \\"Try Again. Fail Again. Fail Better.\\"<br /><br />Ignition  - The fuel necessary for the repetition required for skill development. Coyle scours the world for examples of talent hotbeds and teases out some primal cues that stirs the fires necessary for the commitment necessary towards being world experts. One interesting finding is that effort-based language (eg. you are working hard) is more effective for igniting than intelligence based language (eg. you are really smart) because it speaks to the very core of the learning experience (by building myelin and improving circuits).<br /><br />Master Coaching  - The guidance necessary to cultivate world class talent. Coyle interviews various sports and talent coaches and learns that good coaches generally have a toolset of depth of knowledge, perceptiveness of personalities, directly instructive communication skills, and an innate sense of empathy for their students. Not surprisingly, these qualities of master coaching are also a result of years of practice and myelin building.<br /><br />Overall, the book was a great, quick read. Coyle litters the book with interesting anecdotes while keeping the pacing lean and the content organized. That's tough to do. I learned a few things that could be beneficial to my own personal development, which is always nice. Some of his findings and statements sound a little too definitive, but it does make for a persuasive piece of writing. If you're looking for a detailed exploration of the connections between myelination and skill development, this is not the book for you. Otherwise, I highly recommend it.nding is that effort-based language (eg. you are working hard) is more effective for igniting than intelligence based language (eg. you are really smart) because it speaks to the very core of the learning experience (by building myelin and improving circuits).<br /><br />Master Coaching  - The guidance necessary to cultivate world class talent.

0525478817|3.0|First I have to say that this is my first time I read a book by John Green (le gasp!) and sadly I am just not his type (perhaps my stupid minuscule brain can't comprehend his nerdfighter awesomeness). I do have to say I love him and Hank, and Sarah, and Katherine. Dude, love their vlogs!<br />Okay, okay, let's talk about this book. If you haven't noticed, this book has a ridiculously high rating on Goodreads. Good job John! :) And I swear that comment was not sarcastic! I was expecting the best book in the world from the high ratings, but like I said before, I am not his type of girl...well his book type of girl.<br /><br />This book was hilarious. I totally pictured John being Augustus. Everything Gus said I could imagine saying it in John's voice. And seriously, the audiobook totally solidified that reasoning (I'll explain later in my audiobook review). John was able to pull off a sad book with a tremendous amount of funny things.<br /><br />Hazel was really like a teen, a real teen. I liked how I couldn't put her in a category. She was not your girly girl or your super tough boy-ish girl. She was just Hazel Grace Lancaster. She was \\"[...]fairly shy - not the hand-raising type\\" (pg 12) also liked to be alone! I was literally jumping for joy when I found out that. She totally seemed like me...but way cooler. Her personality kind of reminded me of an egg. She was shy to a point where she would probably not be the one to approach someone but instead she needed someone like Gus, an outgoing, bubbly, fun character to \\"crack her shell\\". And yeah did I mention how she was super cool? She wasn't your goodie too shoes, seriously, she was just a bundle of perfection that you can't pin down. She really felt like a real teenager.<br /><br />My initial thought was that Augustus reminded me of Naruto. He was a little hyper, nerdy, and adorable! Also like I said before, I couldn't stop myself from picturing John. The way he talked just reminded me of John so god damn much. He was the type of person that EVERYONE loved. There was something about him (a hint of magic perhaps) that just made people like him, very John Green and very Naruto Uzumaki. When I read on, for some reason Gus reminded me (just a teeny weenie bit) of Kise Ryouta due to the fact he was good at basketball and he was funny/silly. There were little things that Gus did that made him just adorable, for example I looooveeed how he called Hazel, Hazel Grace. I loved the \\"always\\" thing Gus and Hazel did also the cigarette thing. There is more I want to say about Gus but I just can't because it will be spoilers.<br /><br />So that was the main characters, now the minor ones. Kaitlyn was unique. She was your typical Pretty Little Liars girls, ugh ew? (See what I did there?) But she hates feet! Yes *high five* and oddly my family has a trend of having a long second toe too *looks at my sister and my mom*. Haha, I guess I don't really hate her, in fact I kind of like her. I also I enjoy how Hazel's dad was more the crying type instead of her mom. Hazel's mom seemed not a patient's mom. She acted happy and celebratory. I really respect the parents in this novel. Isaac was super fun to read. I don't want to spoil anything but I feel for you the most (which is odd because there are characters that I should feel for more). Peter, oh Peter. He was like my chemistry teacher. Dear God above, please help the ones around him. He was a total J-E-R-K! There were so many moments that I would want to punch him to pieces. There is something else I want to say but I need to shut up so yeah...<br /><br />There was something recent that happened in my life that I could somewhat connect with this book. And by somewhat I mean I didn't have...ugh I need to shut up again, or else spoilers will come out.<br /><br />This book was so John Green! I could totally tell he wrote it. It was funny, smart. The relationship wasn't slimy or goopy. The relationship was clean and not like a whiny girl talking how the guy is gorgeous and need him by her side and their skin would touch and fire flares and universes collide blah blah blah.<br /><br />Wow, from what you had read it seemed like this book was epically awesome right? And I have to say that the pros seem to out weight the cons but within the cons, there lies something indescribable.<br /><br />I guess I shall begin with the cons now right? You will see that this part compares to the previous section is basically inexistent. For this book the beginning sounded a little, not real. I mean really?! Hazel would just go to a stranger boy's house? They just met, I don't know, an hour ago? I knew she was ill and that she probably doesn't interact much as her parents would grab on to any chance of interactions with the world but still! Hazel's mom didn't even offer to go with Hazel. She just basically left her with Gus. Really?! To me this book was just a book with great characters, and nothing else. The plot was simply weak. It felt like I was at a retirement home and it was Bingo night: \\"B4, B4, B4.\\". Nothing really surprising happened, it just seemed like I was a boat and I was just following the current, slowly travelling down the stream. I mean there wasn't even a waterfall that I could fall off to (at least that would be exciting). Now on to something that is super hard to explain and sounds a little foolish and many probably won't understand.<br /><br />The hamartia of this book was that it wasn't emotional enough for me. Everyone said they had felt SUPER sad when they finished. Most people cried. Most people said that it was the saddest book they had ever read. Seriously, I did not cry, in fact I didn't really felt bad (I am a sadist) except in one scene. And you might think that \\"Oh Ashley is just cold-hearted\\". Oh how you are wrong there my friend. Just ask the people who know me well, haha, I cry over almost everything. But this book just didn't provoke my crying, teary emotions. I was expecting and wishing and praying that this book would make me cry like The Kite Runner did. I think the reason was that I didn't truly felt the love between Gus and Hazel (please don't kill me for saying that). But I really didn't feel their love, and how they connected. I wished this book made me crawl into a corner with a blanket around me and cry until the stars exploded, but unfortunately didn't happen. I wished this book could make me feel exposed, and vulnerable. I wished this book made me cry in the middle of the night like it happened with The Kite Runner. I wished my body would spaz when I thought of a quote from the book. I wished this book made me cry from the bottom of my heart (and my ugly crying face can be revealed but I still wouldn't give a crap because I was so emotionally destroyed). But all those I wished are just I wished, and that was the hamartia of this book.<br /><br />You can argue that I am just not worthy of a John Green novel or perhaps I don't have the brain to understand John Green and this book. And those arguments can be very valid. Just one last thing before you leave, I respect John Green from the bottom of my weird, twisted heart. Even though I didn't enjoy this book as much as I hoped, I know that John, you are one of a kind, one in a lifetime type of person. You are a treasure in our crumbling world, and I might be just to lost in it to see your light.<br /><br />Audiobook review:<br />Okay, all hail Kate Rudd! She sounded like a female version of John Green. No wait! She reminds me of Katherine, John's sister in law. The way she changed from all the characters was amazing! Wow! Brilliant! She could do a sad, melancholy voice or Gus' super funny, bubbly voice. She could change from the different gender perfectly and she was able to made distinctive voices for different characters. But I most loved about Kate was her ability to produce an Amsterdam accent. Yes Kate did mention in an interview that the accent was a challenge she faced when recording this butit sure felt like she was part Dutch.<br />I loved the music in the ends of the audiobooks. Kate was amazing! Okay, here is the thing with the audiobook. Augustus sounded like an excited kid. He was vey happy, jokey type of person. If I didn't listen to the audiobook and instead read the book by itself, would I had cried? Because perhaps Gus would sound more mature and the relationship between Hazel and Gus would be more connected?<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 for the audiobook.<br /><br />Haha, I wonder if anyone is actually going to read my review in its entirety.ing that this book would make me cry like The Kite Runner did. I think the reason was that I didn't truly felt the love between Gus and Hazel (please don't kill me for saying that). But I really didn't feel their love, and how they connected.

And those arguments can be very valid. Just one last thing before you leave, I respect John Green from the bottom of my weird, twisted heart. Even though I didn't enjoy this book as much as I hoped, I know that John, you are one of a kind, one in a lifetime type of person. You are a treasure in our crumbling world, and I might be just to lost in it to see your light.<br /><br />Audiobook review:<br />Okay, all hail Kate Rudd! She sounded like a female version of John Green. No wait! She reminds me of Katherine, John's sister in law. The way she changed from all the characters was amazing! Wow! Brilliant! She could do a sad, melancholy voice or Gus' super funny, bubbly voice. She could change from the different gender perfectly and she was able to made distinctive voices for different characters. But I most loved about Kate was her ability to produce an Amsterdam accent. Yes Kate did mention in an interview that the accent was a challenge she faced when recording this butit sure felt like she was part Dutch.<br />I loved the music in the ends of the audiobooks. Kate was amazing! Okay, here is the thing with the audiobook. Augustus sounded like an excited kid. He was vey happy, jokey type of person. If I didn't listen to the audiobook and instead read the book by itself, would I had cried? Because perhaps Gus would sound more mature and the relationship between Hazel and Gus would be more connected?<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 for the audiobook.<br /><br />Haha, I wonder if anyone is actually going to read my review in its entirety.
0307341550|2.0|This is a book about several very nasty people, a few distasteful people and some that were simply uninteresting.  The central character Camille falls in the latter category as she wanders through the story either under the influence of alcohol or when sober in a dreamlike world seemingly incapable of any imagination or initiative in dealing with the world about her.  Camille has a small success near the end when she makes a discovery about one of the deceased, but that turns out to be unimportant in the solving of the mystery.  In a way her inconsequential success predicts the final tragedy.<br /><br />The setting of the story in Missouri was of interest to me, but the tale of Camille and the town folk were blended together in by a series of events that did not seem real to me.  Two or three in the series of events may have been possible, but after that I had to make an effort to suspend belief in reality to finish the book.  That is easier to do if at least one of the characters is interesting.<br /><br />The author, for some reason, provides Camille with a \\"pretty face\\" and makes note of this feature several times in the book.  It is not clear to me how Camille's looks are meaningful to the story line.  Perhaps it's a reference to beauty only being skin deep.<br /><br />My reaction is obviously out of step with the general reaction by others to this book.  I have not read many psychological thrillers before.  Perhaps readers of this type of book are better able to judge the merits of this book.  My reason for reading this book is that I read Gone Girl, thoroughly enjoyed the first half of it and was looking forward to more of that type of storytelling.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I had to see what all the fuss was about. This book is proof that marketing and the force of the masses can sell anything. It amassed to a teenage novel with adult sex scenes. The same imagery used over and over again became so painful that I eventually had to abandon the book 60% of the way in.  Do yourself a favor and rather just search \\"dominance\\" on Wikipedia. It will save you the time and the agony.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Fantastic movie.  Great story, wonderful acting and thoroughly enjoyed.  Simply put, well worth the money for a rental on Amazon Instant Video. Will not disappoint.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Nancy Horan has done a wonderful thing to write this book from Mamah Borthwick's view point.  While some of what she writes is obviously fiction, she reports many of the details of events accurately.  She develops her characters memorably.  I wanted to get into the book and tell Mamah that I am from the future and if she continued on her path with Frank, she and her children will die a horrible death.  But, of course, I could not do that.  Besides, Mamah's close friends tried to tell her that she should not continue on a path that would break up two families.  She did not listen to them.  At first, I thought that I would get a feel for Mamah Borthwick without going into the horrible fire.  Unfortunately, as I got through the book, I realized that the fire was a significant factor in the life and Mamah and her children with Ed Cheney.  I found myself wondering that if she found people's reactions to her affair difficult to deal with back in the early 1900's, how would she have reacted if she knew that over 100 years later, people are still talking about the affair she had with Frank.  Thank you, Nancy Horan, for introducing us to Mamah Borthwick.
0345803485|5.0|From the moment I started to read, I was in love with MrGrey. I seriously could not put it down,when I did, all I could think about was the book and what was going to happen next. This was an amazingly erotic story that made me want to be Anastasia so bad. I cannot get Mr Grey out of my mind. The feeling you get inside while your reading certain parts was amazing. I'm sad I finished them,I want more!!!!! There is an emptiness now since I'm not reading it. Never had I read a book that was so intriguing and couldn't put down. Absolutely Amazing. My thanks and gratitude to the author.

B008BM9L72|1.0|Shallow story line - basically too predictable and not believable at all.  In a nutshell it's female porn.  Could not be bothered to finish it.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Just a short comment. Gerbert d'Aurillac in real life was a hero of civilization, tolerant and wise. Born in France, he studied in Spain and learned about the advanced ideas and technology that were circulating in contemporary Islamic civilization. He returned to France and promoted ideas such as Arabic numbers, a type of abacus, and an important astronomical instrument - the types of things that were important in further building up Western civilization. I feel he was somewhat mis-represented in this novel. :-) But if the author hadn't included him, I never would have looked him up and learned about him, so I am grateful for that!
B0081HLMD8|4.0|I'm more apt to watch a foreign film these days than the crap out of Hollywood. Headhunters is a perfect example of why. Excellent characters, well written and not quite what you expect. Don't let subtitles keep you from watching this excellent film. Highly recommended!
B000WDROYK|5.0|The absolute best film on WWII I have ever seen, and I have seen about all of the good ones.  There is a building tension, several levels of plots and sub-plots, masterful acting and believable characters.  In this genre, this is a must see.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|easy and fun to do when bored especially if u are not intrested in other games to do. Cool app:)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|That story is so unrealistic and so raw. That's hard porn. I couldn't finish reading the first book. I had to stop. I'm glad I borrowed it from my library, otherwise I would regret buying it.<br /><br />The Anastasia character is not so bad: young student, naive, had no experience in sex and is looking for love and passion. But Christian is disgusting and pathetic. Although his past experience made him who is, still, he's too rigid, which causes the story to lose a great deal of its charm.
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|I love the app....really HATE the ads!  The ads are positioned so that you can't help but hit them. ugh!
B002UZXJA6|5.0|While not my personal favorite, Songs from the Heart is a wonderful collection that any CW fan will love.<br />The songs I love:<br />Nil Se'n La, a wonderful song about staying up all night dancing and singing \\"until all the songs are sung.\\" It will have you tapping your feet and singing along, too :) (It's for this song that I gave the product 5 stars)<br />My Lagan Love, sung by Lynn with only vocal accomaniment, is a haunting melody about someone's true love. It includes beautiful phrases like \\"the twilight gleam is in her eyes\\" and \\"the crickets' singing stone.\\"<br />Isle of Hope, Isle of Tears is a lovely ballad-type song about Irish people coming to Ellis Island to find a new life.<br />The Coast of Galacia, one of Mairead's two solos, is a lively tune with almost gyspy-like phrases and lively dance music in Mairead's indescribable style.<br />Goodnight My Angel, a lullaby I want to sing to my own kids when I have some.<br />Galway Bay, sung by Chloe, is a lovely song, sad and sweet. The singer longs for Ireland and will ask God \\"to make my heaven in that dear land across the Irish Sea.\\"<br />The Lost Rose Fantasia, a sad searching instrumental played by Mairead.<br />I also like Fields of Gold, Non C'e Piu, and You'll Be in my Heart, but the other ones I could do without, especially O America.<br />Things that would have made this CD better:<br />If Alex and Lynn both had two solos. Mairead, Chloe, and Lisa all have two solos each. The two (then) newcomers have beautiful voices and deserve to use them more often.<br />If the liner notes included lyrics. I don't understand why they didn't put lyrics in! I like to look at the songs isolated from their musical sense. I can't be the only one who is bothered by this.<br />If Lisa actually sang at least one Irish song. Her solos are Fields of Gold and The Moon's a Harsh Mistress. Don't get me wrong: her voice is heart-warming and beautiful. But is it too much to ask for an Irish singer to sing an Irish song?<br />Overall, though, this CD is well-worth adding to your collecion. You won't regret buying it :)

B009329Y30|4.0|I would have given this movie five stars, if the costume designer would have not allowed Taylor Schilling's hair to be in her face for 69% of the film! My goodness! Her bangs started to distract me from the plot and her acting; her hair had a distancing effect on me. I also think they could have chosen a woman who was a bit younger to play Schilling's role as well. Sorry to sound so mean toward her. Overall, she did do a great job!<br /><br />The movie's great too...
B008RC72G8|5.0|Keep in mind I will on purpose keep many spoilers out of this review on purpose. Who wants to see or buy a film that has had every moment ruined and hashed out for them. So having said that let me say, I LOVED THIS FILM. I was very against this film due to the trailer but I am glad I went and saw it in theatres because I was begging for more by the end of the film. This film does indeed have spell to cast, one that is magical, and totally Burton. Yet this Burton film is very much like those of 'ole in that it falls in vein with Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and Sweeney Todd. From the first chords of the films opening song---NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN--I was totally hooked. Let me also state that I find it ironic that fans of the orginal show---not all--but some ---hate this film---when in turn the stars of the original show---which some appear in this film---gave the film not only thumbs up but also their blessing. Now isn't that ironic? The film does follow the premise of the original show but with some new liberties and tweaks, and I was amazed to realize that salutes in certain scenes to the films HALLOWEEN, CARRIE, and THE SHINING all which not only influenced a generation but also Burton as a filmmaker. I would definitely suggest this to any film lover, fan of the show, and anyone who is looking for a vampire style film that is not Twilight and is not a gore fest. I truly am suprised that this film did not do better. But I think the studios should never have advertised this as a comedy because it is not. Like other serious films and even horror films, there is some funny moments, which lighten the mood, but it seems once you are smiling and laughing something happens to give you pause and shudder at the dark light of what has just occurred. Give this film a chance. The acting is top notch. The film's capture of the era is pitch perfect. The only sad thing is that Burton has said he will not make a sequel which this film was a set up for grand and great seriesor even a trilogy of films. But who knows what will happen. I will say, disregard the negative fan base reviews, especially if you are a fan of the genre, Burton, or just love movies. Oh and yes let's not forget the Depp fans, this is one of his best films. So definitely buy it. Love this movie.

0142419400|4.0|I've been wanting to read this book for so long to see what the buzz was all about and now that I finally did it, I get it. Anna and the French Kiss is a lovely, funny read with dramatic elements also, a great heroine, a swoon-worthy hero, great writing and a satisfying ending. The fact that the whole thing happens in Paris is just the cherry on top of the cake.<br /><br />Basically the story is about this young woman, Anna, who is sent to France against her will for her senior year and there she befriends this really cute guy, &Eacute;tienne, with whom she starts falling in love, but unfortunately he is already taken.<br /><br />She tries to stay away from him, and he keeps going after his girlfriend, but it's quite clear that eventually they will fall into each other's arms, and honestly no one can blame them, since &Eacute;tienne was so unhappy in his relationship, his girlfriend couldn't give him the support he needed, while Anna was always there. It's actually weird for me to have enjoyed a book that in a way deals with cheating, but somehow Stephanie Perkins makes it look okay.<br /><br />Most of all, I really enjoyed the way Anna and &Eacute;tienne's friendship evolved, and how she gains confidence in herself throughout the story. I also enjoyed how the author took Anna away from her home and parents and gave her what teenagers all around the world most want: freedom to do as they please, but at the same time made her homesick and wishing her mum was there to comfort her in so many scenes.<br /><br />If I could change anything about this book, I would probably change the first kiss between Anna and &Eacute;tienne, just because *for me* it didn't have a wow factor - I mean, they have so many lovely moments where tension builds up to a point where a kiss would have been perfect, and then they go and kiss in this random, totally out of the blue, not romantic at all scene. I didn't feel it. I also didn't like how Anna behaved with Bridge when she found out about that guy whose name I can't remember right now.<br /><br />Anyway, it was a good, fun read, and I certainly recommend it.n't remember right now.<br /><br />Anyway, it was a good, fun read, and I certainly recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|this book is awesome in almost every way but you have to give to some of the haters that katniss was in the hospitol for basically the whole book doing absollutly nothing. Then when she did get better she would get hurt again and we were back at square one. though i think the people who gave this book one star are pretty harsh they do have point. i even thought that this was the my least favorite of the series. oh and everyone stop gushing over that petta and katniss are perfect its so annoying
B008N1V11U|5.0|gameloft has made a great game good graphics and follows the storyline really well and no glitches i cant say the same about the amazing spiderman
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very good game. I would recommend it to to anyone who has a Kindle Fire. I would give it 5 stars
B008D28HYS|4.0|I'm a big fan of nonograms, but this is my first experience with a color variation. Overall, it works fairly well. I would like to see the 'x' as an option along side the other color brushes instead of having to double click. Marking cells as 'not filled' is  just as important as coloring it in, but it is more cumbersome.
0312370830|2.0|The premise of the story is gripping and indeed, the first chapter hooks the reader. But it's all downhill from there. The author is self-indulgent. The trials of her protagonist are overly obvious or overly manufactured. She shows very little insight into the minds of children. Some scenes blithely contradict whatever she's trying to convey and the writing, overall, is adolescent. I was very disappointed.

1469984202|5.0|I don't want to call this science fiction.  That classifies it with too many unbelievable fantasy books.  It is very well written, completely believable, and extremely engrossing.  It's time to check his other novels...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I think a 12 year old could have been more imaginative....jeeez what a crappy read...had a hard time finishing it.  I will NOT be buying the other two books....yawn....I would clearly have to be a MASOCHIST to buy the sequels! IMO, it was not real imaginative, mundane and so stupid...However, Katrina Lumsden's review was hilarious and SPOT ON!! See the review link below!! Okay, I am editing because it left out my link so IF it does it again...just Google Katrina Lumsden and the link will appear for her HILARIOUS review!!! [...]

0439023521|5.0|Hunger Games was a great book.  What I liked best about this book was how good the kids were at fighting.  What I  liked least about the book was when Rue died.  I think kids would like this book because it's exciting,it is easy to read,the fighting is cool although I wouldn't want to my family to go through it.  I would strongly recommend this book.
B005PK1G76|4.0|Very solid product for the price and I'm happy with it...<br />- Fits the City Mini GT stroller nicely<br />- Durable material - not flimsy<br />- Great price at <$10<br /><br />Only downside is I wish it had hidden storage space for valuables. There's one small zipper compartment on the inside of the middle open pocket. However, the pocket for this zippered space is mesh, so you can see the contents from the outside that're zipped up if you look closely. I keep my iPhone and car / house keys in this zippered area, but there's little room for anything else (I don't think my wallet would fit in there too, so if I'm going for a long walk and don't want to bring diaper bag, I just bring my ID and small amount of cash). All other pockets are completely open / exposed (2 pockets on the outside fit cups nicely, and the middle pocket is larger which is nice to grab things quickly, like wipes / snack / small toy.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst contribution to the body of English language fiction ever.  Why not just call it what it is: \\"Penthouse Letters: With bondage, ropes, chains and a stupid redhead\\"?  It is an insult to the intelligence of the average American reader who does want to read erotica, but prefers erotica with a brain behind it.  Think D.H. Lawrence.  Think \\"Tropic of Cancer\\".  Think \\"Tropic of Capricorn\\".  Think \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\".  This is nothing but cheap pornography for those who never passed their fourth grade reading comp exams and are still wondering what a t-h-i-g-h is.  The penner of this book is neither writer nor author but a bored mother and housewife who's still waiting to pass her G.E.D.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The novels Fifty Shades Trilogy were excellent.  You must read all three to understand and get the full benefit of the story.  They were exciting, sad, erotic, and a wonderful romantic ending.
145162607X|4.0|This is a compelling book that gives insight into the life of Anne Neville, about which very little is truly known.  I particularly enjoyed the depiction of Elizabeth Woodville, the title character of THE WHITE QUEEN, because Anne's perspective is quite different from the portrait painted there.  Anyone who has read Ms. Gregory's previous works in this series will find recurring patterns, and I like the \\"wheel of fortune\\" motif that she uses throughout these novels.  Such is life, indeed.<br /><br />My only real quibble with the book is the frequent repetition in the actual writing.  Adjectives and phrases re-appear within paragraphs and sometimes within sentences.  As someone who taught English comp. for 100 years, I found it startling that Ms. Gregory would be unaware of this misstep.  Certainly, a good editor would have been helpful.  But perhaps I am just a dinosaur who remembers the function of a thesaurus.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable and quick read.  On the whole, Ms. Gregory's stories are so good that I sometimes think I read them too quickly; thus; I am going to re-read the books in this series to see the details that I missed.
B000BCE918|5.0|Great movies all three! Love the realistic looking animals. Totally Awesome !TWO THUMBS UP! Definitely scary and a thriller.  A very wonderful movie that everyone that likes dinosaurs will definitely enjoy! :-)

B00005JKCH|5.0|This Spider man film is ultra cool.  I really enjoyed it.  Fun and action packed.  I was interested in watching it because it's a super hero movie but where I'm ultra clueless because I don't actually read the comic book, it just made it a more enjoyable experience.  Highly recommended.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Been a fan of thrash since the mid 80's. Loved testament when they first came out. This Album recaptures the majic of The New order plus some. A must have for any metal fan!!!
B000HCO83Q|2.0|In the closer to this series it is very anti-climatic.  I understood what they were trying to do, but they failed horribly.  As most movie series go, usually the movie squels they make the quality goes down, which was what happened in this case.  It would be a good watch and purchase if you want the entire collection, but don't expect anything great.  Saddened.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love how you don't have to constantly babysit it.. unless you're hatching an egg... I do wish that the store items were cheaper and once you're town gets to a certain size, the next expansion cost is astronomical.
B0006L0LNY|5.0|Halle Berry steals the show in this film.  It was super-fantantic as she is ultra gorgeous.  Although how she became Catwoman was a bit cheesy, after that part of the film she steals the show.  It was long overdue to have a female star in a film about a super hero.  Purrfectly recommended.
0385737947|2.0|The characters were mostly interchangeable and largely irrelevant. The plot barely made sense. Author threw in a bunch of random violence and faux-cursing to make the novel appear \\"edgy.\\" Seemed like he was trying to capitalize on the success of dystopian teen novels such as The Hunger Games, but The Maze Runner is not nearly as thoughtful or exciting as its much more competent predecessors. Slow moving, dull, and ultimately unfulfilling. Eh.
B00417HUV0|5.0|When I was about 8 years old this was the first cassette I was ever given and it ruined me.  Twisted Forever.  It was realkly shocking that they disbanded after this CD was released as it is their best work.  Love is For Suckers is great, even if it did include Marky Carter in the writing.  Me & the Boys is great.  Love this CD forever.  Recommended beyond words.
B004GF244K|5.0|I remember seeing this amazing performance on PBS, and was hooked from that moment on.  Excellent lineup of artists, and extremely well put together.  This was an excellent show, from start to finish.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone.

B003YNFYD8|5.0|I received my order much quicker than the stated delivery date, and I understand why they give a longer delivery date. The CD was packaged very well for protection during delivery. The only damage I could see was one corner appeared barely torn/ragged but that isn't anything that wouldn't have happened to me anyway. The CDs themselves were perfect, in great working order and it's made my day to listen to them as I drive to work! I would have complete confidence in ordering from this seller again!

B0002XVQNU|5.0|The people I talked with were more negative about this film then they were positive, but I really enjoyed it.  Ben Afflect, Colin Ferrel and Jennifer did a super job in this film.  I don't read the comic book, so that probably helped my enjoyment of this film because I had nothing to compare it to, but I ultra loved it.  Highly recommended.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|When the Dreams box set was released back in the late 1980's, it included tracks 8-11 from this wonderful radio show from the WPLJ-FM Radio Broadcast.  This set was performed for a small audience two months before Duane's death.  If you are a fan of the original Allman Brothers band, and if you think you heard everything before, you are in for a surprise.  If you love the band as I do, this disc comes highly recommended.  I am amazed that yet again something still pops up on the early days.  What's next?  Anything?

B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is amazing.  My first doctor was David Tennant, so I wanted his screwdriver.  My 14-year-old little brother (who is not a Whovian....yet) is constantly getting annoyed by my buzzing and scanning.  Having this is so worth getting yelled at :D
0345803485|5.0|This book was sooooo good; the storyline is something that everyone can relate to; I finished the 1st novel in 2 days and I read it again. Please keep them coming!
B008IGP8RI|5.0|Spent the morning at the movies watching the new release \\"Lawless\\". While the film was pretty good the soundtrack was just outstanding. I stayed to read the credits and was surprised to see just how much of this is Nick Cave's work whether as a performer with The Bootleggers or as a songwriter (Nick also wrote the screenplay for the film). I was looking specifically to see if there was a soundtrack available and did not see any mention of it in the credits. I'm pleased to see this is indeed available and eagerly await it's arrival.

B00110K62U|5.0|Awesome musical with wonderful singing by all performers, particularly the children.  The Master of the House sequence is particularly entertaining!  It is true history entertwined with fantastic music!
0061478784|5.0|I'm not even sure words can capture how much I loved this book.  I have grown up loving fantasy stories like this (Patricia C. Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles were and still are some of my favorites).  This novel is up there among my favorites.  Like many people, I have also seen the movie, but, in my opinion, the book is a million times better.  It has it's differences from the movie version, but these are what make is so entertaining.  The characters seem more alive and real - not quite so Disney-fied.  I loved the movie, too, but with the book I enjoyed being able to create my own vision of the characters.  They were not quite so perfect, and I was able to relate to them much more easily.  I devoured this book (and the other two about Howl, Sophie, and Calcifer).  I only wish there were more.  This is the kind of story that makes you want to live in its world and talk with its characters.  I would recommend it for anyone, no matter their age.  This is not just a kids book, but one that can be loved forever.
B004K583KA|5.0|I have been listening to Bach Cantatas since 1976, so 36 years. Over the years I have been very fortunate to be able to listen about 4-10 hours per day, almost every day. I listen about 98% of my time to the Cantatas. Thank God for CDs. They are easier than changing tapes. I had a professor who said once that, \\"Just think. Until 50 years ago you might only be able to hear a piece of music once in your life!!\\" I have been to Leipzig, Germany but I would have to live there for my entire life if there were not CDs!<br /><br />I had a job that allowed me to listen to Johnny for hours at a time. Then when I got home at night and on the weekends I literally would listen for hours and hours at a time. I must have heard the Saint Matthew Passion a hundred times, maybe more. I do not speak German, I just enjoy the music!<br /><br />Anyway I thought that over the years I had purchased the majority of the Cantatas. Then I sat down and figured it out that I still needed to purchase about 100 more. I could not believe that I had not heard that many of Johnny's Cantatas. But it was true.<br /><br />I buy most of my things on Amazon and so when I saw the Rilling complete Cantatas I bought them. They are wonderful. So many Cantatas are new to me, which is wonderful. They are not that expensive, compared to purchasing them on individual disks.<br /><br />One of things that I really like about the Rilling is that I can really hear the harpsichord. Sometimes my other versions substitute a piano!! which is a big no no.<br />So I recommend this set very highly.<br /><br />Update--April 11, 2013<br />Well I have listened to each CD at least 5-10 times since I bought the set. The music is SO WONDERFUL and the Conductor and orchestra members are so great!!. I constantly enjoy JSB's Cantatas.<br /><br />I find it so hard to believe that one can buy all this joy for $65.00 !!!

B0082GQ5HG|4.0|The Pirates! Band of Misfits, or as it is more correctly known The Pirates! In An Adventure with Scientists! but... Americans.<br /><br />This is the latest stop-motion animation from Aardman Animation (best known for their Wallace and Gromit animations) and you can't miss their style in this, both visually and in the script.<br /><br />It doesn't quite hit those heights, lacking perhaps the juxstaposition of the familiar and homely with the fantastical, but it easily offers more originality and wit than 90% of family oriented animated movies.<br /><br />Visually this is the most ambitious stop-animated work I've ever seen. It maintains the claymation look that Aardman are known for, while effectively blending in computer animation for the backgrounds of the sea and sky amongst other things.  It works very well and doesn't detract from the unique Aardman look.<br /><br />The story is not what you'd call deep and covers familiar territory for children's movies but the balance of visual and verbal gags effectively plays to the adults in the audience as well as the kids. With a relatively short running time you certainly aren't let feeling bored at any stage.<br /><br />Another thing worth noting is the stellar (primarily British) voice cast from top to bottom. Even relatively minor characters get the perfect voices. Although unfortunately a couple were replaced in the US version by American actors because.... Americans.<br /><br />So, if you've got kids this is a good one for them to watch because you'll enjoy it yourself. If you like stop motion animation... you need to watch the masters in action. And if you're just looking for a way to pass the time, this will be better than most options.

6305531412|5.0|I was very young when Roger Rabbit came out and I was so impressed. I am still impressed today. Even with all the CGI out there now, this movie really holds up well. I am a fan of computer-animated movies, but when they mix it with live action, they risk overdoing it and making things look fake. Or, they are so eager about what they can do with the CGI and how they can \\"impress\\" us, they don't worry about other things they should, like acting or plot. With Roger Rabbit, even though they were doing something innovative, they did not forget those two things. And as far as I can think of, Roger Rabbit is really the only movie of its kind. [[ASIN:B002BIGCXS Pete's Dragon (High-Flying Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0002VEPRQ Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition)]] are two of my all-time favorite movies. However, their included animation did not have the 3-D effect that Roger Rabbit did. (But I must empathize that they did what they did do extremely well - they were both older movies - and the actors interacted very well with the animated characters. Both amazing movies.)<br /><br />As someone who loves art, I really appreciate the time and effort that went into making Roger Rabbit look good. (Of course, as someone who loves acting and movies, I also appreciate the acting and story that made it a good movie.) Like I said, I really like a lot of computer-animated movies, but as far as I can tell from watching the special features on those movies, the computer does most of the work. It seems like once the computer program is set up, the animator just presses some buttons and clicks the mouse. Not that that doesn't take talent, but it's a different kind of talent. Roger Rabbit is more of a traditional, actual type of art. Real people actually drew all that. Then they went in there and added shading and somehow made 2-dimensional animated characters look like they fit in with 3-dimensional actors. What skill! Actually, considering what they can do today with computers, it makes Roger Rabbit all the more impressive.er Rabbit all the more impressive.

B0000029DD|5.0|Moved by his music at a young age, I heard his voice again in college and I was so driven by it I looked online and typed in the lyrics while I listened.  Upon finding out his name and the song (Last Goodbye), I discovered he had drowned...his fear.  A waste of such a talented, handsome, amazing young person.  Luckily for us all, his music lives on.<br /><br />Hallelujah has been used so often since.  He was not the first to sing it, but it is the only time it has made me get emotional.  Grace is so powerful (the song itself) and Corpus Christi was even used to get the true emotion of the words across to my college English class.  Just saying the words did NOTHING in comparison to what we all felt hearing him sing it.  Funny, the guy that brought it to class was my secret crush since I had landed on campus a year earlier.  Mojo Pin is such a sexy, riveting song that changes the total feel of his voice to one that is a little less pure but beautiful just the same....<br /><br />This does not set the rest aside, mind you...I have literally had chills from his voice.  If you don't get why, I suppose you just don't.  Of course, I do!  There are certain artists that come along and change lives.  Jeff Buckley is one of those.  You want to know him, and you long to hear him.  He is a muse, of sorts.  You shouldn't be disappointed in this CD.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|Pros: Easy and quick installation and configuration. Works well with mouse and keyboard when playing PS3.<br />Cons: Not all types of mouses and keyboards are supported. The scoping mode sensitivity is still not as good as playing on PC.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />I have been a PC gamer for years now and I hate using controllers when playing PS3 FPS games. I did months of researches on the mouse and keyboard converters for PS3 until I saw this product. At first I was kinda afraid of trying this product when I saw some of the negative reviews, but I finally gave it a try and I must say it was amazing. It works very well without using the scope mode during the game play. As I said the sensitivity for the scoping mode is not very good even I set the in-game sensitivity to the highest. Over all, this is a great buy if you want to play your PS3 as a PC.<br /><br />I know many people have hard time on choosing the right/compatible mouse and keyboard. So make sure you visit the official forum of the product to check the list of compatible mouse and keyboard and also use the latest firmware to configure your settings. My mouse is Razer Naga Molten special edition and my keyboard is GE Wireless keyboard (a classic keyboard you can get it from Target for cheap); both of them works very well.<br /><br />I heard that a new firmware 3.1 is coming out soon. Hope more mouses and keyboards are become compatible so that I can get a gaming keyboard to work with my Razer Naga Molten. After all, I enjoy using this product. It made me feel like playing games on my PC.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I'm so sick of buying collections of Star Wars movies and being disappointed. I just wanted to finally own some copies of the original movies, and this seemed like the most economic way to get all 3 on disc. The thing is horrible, and so unlike the original series I felt like I was watching another movie. The retouched HD/Blue Ray or whatever gives it a 'made for TV' look, and the special FX are awful. (Tauntauns running look like they were animated on South Park). The packaging is cheap and the presentation is hurried. Ugh. Just not worth another minute of my time. I'm so sad to have spent this money, but not surprised. The whole franchise has turned to crap, as everybody knows.

B005OZ4E3A|4.0|This is a great CD; I love Laura Pausini's voice and music and that hasn't changed. However,I would like to see her progress a little more in future....this album (while wonderful) does sound very much --too much--like her last several.<br /><br />Also, Amazon marketplace purchasers will want to check their product carefully. I too received the spanish version instead of the Italian one. In the end, Laura is Laura, and the beauty of her singing really transcends whatever romance language she happens to be using on the CD. So I decided to avoid the hassle and stick with the Spanish version. However, for those of you for whom this matters more...caveat emptor. \\"Italian version\\" may be what it says, but that doesn't mean that's what you get.

B0058YPLA2|5.0|Such an amazing show, I grew up watching Disney movies, and I loved fairytale stories, so being an adult and getting a new point of view in each story, it's amazing. I love the characters, I love the stories, I just love everything about this TV show, and I just can't get enough of it. So when I had the opportunity, I just had to buy the blu-ray, and let me tell you, it's amazing, the extras are great, and I just love it. I'm also very pleased with Amazon, since with no extra charge, I got the Blu-ray in a week, I live in Mexico and my shippments usually arrive two or three weeks after it's shipped, and now I got it in less than a week. Thumps up!!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|the fiio 6 is a very good item i give it four stars. the  item is a nice size to be so small it shows  lot of power and its very light in weight  , so that  will  come in  handy when walking or running
0451228731|5.0|I understand this book rippled all the way up to the top levels of the US Government, and well it should. It gives a great example of how software could totally cripple the world as we know it. It is well within possibility NOW for rage-filled software geniuses to develop systems that could......kill; recruit and extort agents from prisons; read the news and react; develop car missiles and electric guns, guiding them by GPS; and infiltrate, manipulate, and control our largest companies -- even after the system developers die!<br /><br />While I'm sure Daemon has, thankfully, caused US anti-cyberwar efforts to be increased, it no doubt presents an impetus too -- to our enemies. Nevertheless, it is very well-written and exciting, and Suarez does a superb job interweaving and resolving multiple characters and threads (done as well as anything by, e.g., Tom Clancy.) Bravo!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK.  I stayed up late into the night to read it because I could not set it down.  I read it more than once because I could not forget the storyline and needed more.  I surely wish Miss Setterfield would write another book.  I have this in hardback on a special place on my bookshelves.  5 well earned stars.

B003G4W49C|3.0|Being a fan of the author's fiction, I wanted to read an example of his sci fi work.  It was more difficult to connect with the 6 year old prodigy than adult characters.  More than once I thought, \\"I just don't like sci fi\\".  I persisted to the end and actually liked the ending.  Discovering that it will soon be a movie, I'm glad to have the background on the story.

0307460444|2.0|Loved the Oreo cheesecake recipe and so far that has been it. I've made several of the cupcakes and they are more like a coffee cake.  The cakes are more dry than they are moist and airy. The icings are so-so. Not worth the money.

0439023521|5.0|As author of [[ASIN:B008ZGGLR2 Champagne Cocktails (Romance Novel)]]  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is by far one of my top books of all time. I could not put the book down and read through it in one sitting. Her vision of the dystopian future was actually more frightening than any of the violence that takes place in the book. I believe the book resonated strongly with the reader due to the fact that many of us see the Big Brother aspect in the book.

B007WFQZF0|4.0|In its 10 year run, Brooklyn-based Liars has not stopped surprising us, evolving and developing into many musical directions, yet always sounding very recognizable. After 2010's excellent \\"Sisterworld\\" album, the trio now returns with its 6th studio album.<br /><br />\\"WIXIW\\" (11 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with a very dreamy, electronic track \\"The Exact Color of Doubt\\" and with track 2 \\"Octagon\\" in the same vein, it becomes clear that the band has taken yet another left turn in their on-going musical journey, and this might be their version of Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" meets \\"The King of Limbs\\". Trank 3 \\"No. 1 Against the Rush\\" (1st single; a fantasy footbal reference?) reminded me somehow of latter-day the National. \\"A Ring on Every Finger\\" is a jumpy song (with in fact part of the melody seemingly lifted straight from the Belgian band Telex's song \\"Lakelele\\" of some 30 years ago). Good track follow one after another, and once you are submerged into the electronica, this is as good as anything Liars have done. \\"Ill Valley Prodigies\\" recalls early-Pink Floyd. The title track becomes an urgent multi-layered synthesizer exercise, just beautiful. Towards the end of the album we get \\"Brats\\", a slighly disco-flavored tune that is as immediately accessible as anything on here (and another single candidate in my opinion).<br /><br />In all, while this seemingly comes as a surprise from Liars, this is an album that just shines from start to finish, with nearly a weak moment in it. It is for me one of the year's best albums so far, and sure to finish high on my year-end list. \\"WIXIW\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMMENDED!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is a must read for all ladies. Do recommend if you would like a little spice to your library.
B00913DPW2|1.0|Great graphics and possibly an exciting game if you can play it without the game locking up. Spend more time shutting down game and going back into it. This game needs an update for playing on the Kindle Fire. Will be happy to rate this 5 stars when the fix is made.
1451627297|4.0|This is a very long book, some 842 pages.  It is a measure of King's unique talents and skills that it held my absorbed interest and attention (much to my wife's displeasure) during a recent beach vacation. There is nobody who can spin a tale like King, and it is gratifying to see that critics are no longer dismissing him because of the unusual stories he tells.<br /><br />The book manifests a number of the features which I find so endearing in King. His knowledge of 1950's and 1960's pop culture, especially the rock and roll of that era, is unsurpassed--very fitting for a rocker himself. His incredibly rich and vivid imagination remain fully intact. He has taken much care to make the story as authentic in setting as possible, considering the historical events occurred 50 years ago. So King is not content to rely upon his masterly writing skill; he has done his homework. He also captures some key elements of the period as I remember them, with individuals like Curtis Lemay and General Walker in prominence. I wonder what somebody under 60 or so must think about this era looking back through King's eyes.<br /><br />For those who still maintain the King can only write the scary stuff with clowns and pet cemeteries that scare the begebers out of you, and that he lacks the ability to write a sensitive and moving love story, I suggest they read pages 837 to the end. I never thought that King could so move me, almost to the point of sniffles, but he sure did.<br /><br />So there is much great stuff in this book. But there are also some problems. The love story that is a major subplot I think goes on far too long given what it contributes to the story--and it does make some important contributions. This leads into my main criticism of the book: it needed a serious editing job as it simply is way too long. I made the same point in my review of \\"The Dome\\" on Amazon. In short, it is a very long haul that I think could have been more effective had it been more compactly edited.But who at a publisher can ever \\"tell\\" King he needs to get out the red pen?<br /><br />The paperback edition has some additional features, including an interview with King, a listing of some music from the period (most of which I never heard of although I am older than King), and a menu listing of dishes of the period (yes, young folks, we did eat that stuff, including me).<br /><br />Hey, it is a great story--enjoy it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the fun loving characters from the movies In the game are fun. especially scratch. love collecting the hearts for more great items.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My daughter just loved this and it became the first toy she actually wanted to play with as Infant. It's very soft and durable. Perfect size to throw in the diaper bag.
B006LSZECO|4.0|very good read with several twists (which I love)  The whole time while reading it, I assumed the writing was from a male perspective -another good twist.  I'm anxious to read more from the author

B0052UZIFA|4.0|It's nothing more than a port like everyone has mentioned, an old port. It's missing the Zen garden &amp; infinite level that have made it to Apple products, but it's not like I don't play this more than any other mobile game!
B006JPS1OM|4.0|interest ing<br />  slightly. dark pinch and zoom hard to use<br />I have played it twice you will find it enjoyable also
B00004STUL|4.0|This is not only one of the best action movies, but also of the best comedies! Has always been one of my favorites. Also one of Martin Lawrence's best (and I've seen almost all his movies)!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I am loving Christian and Ana even more in book two.  After Ana leaves Christian in the first book it takes her a week to go back to him in the second book.  Christian's ex Lehia comes back in the picture to cause trouble and Ana new boss is trying to make a move on her.  Still hate the BDSM stuff in the book. Favorite part is when Christian's family throw him a birthday party and Elena is there try to get in Ana's face when Christian walk in an tell her off but the best part is when his mom over here this whole argument an lets Elena have it about her son. My Favorite line is still Laters Baby.
B000TFHJJQ|4.0|The action scenes in this movie are amazing!!! And for an action movie, the plot was quite well thought out and keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. The acting was also very good, which helps a lot to make the extraordinary scenes and circumstances seem believable and real. I LOVE action movies and this has always been one of may favorites!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Ana Steele is a college student who has no interest in the boys at college.  Her friend Kate works for the school paper an when Kate gets sick she asks Ana to go the do an interview with Christian Grey a single billionaire. When Kate stumbles into Christian's office for the interview he is very taken with her.  Christian is a man that practice the life style of BDSM. He wants Ana to join in this life style with him which she does sign a contract saying she would, but when Christian whips her she realizes she can not do all the things he wants her to so she tells Christian she loves him, but she can't be what he needs her to be so she leaves him.  Christian's Ex Elena is the one who brought him into this life style, but she is still hanging around Christian which Ana hates because she thinks of her as a child molester.  Elena is Christian's mom friend and start a BDSM relationship with him when he was just 15 years old. Personally I love the love story between Christian and Ana, but hate all the BDSM stuff(do people really live this way an life it?) I think it degrading the book to me would have been a 5 star without this stuff. This book is not for the weak at heart it does get extremely kinky.  Favorite line in book is Laters Baby.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Good story, easy read.  Somewhat far fetched as far as a story line; but it had the hero, heroine and a happy ending.
B007SGM084|5.0|WOW leaves you wanting more... when I started reading this everyone teased me about reading a \\"sex\\" novel, OMG they have no idea! The story behind Christen and why he is the way he is, unraveling his story was awesome, I would (will) recommend this book to everyone, keep writing I await more of your stories!!!!
B005DN7W4G|5.0|I forgot this movie. I watched it again this evening and it brough tears to my eyes. Wonderfully done and personally moving. I am surprised this director hasn't done more big movies, if she can do this. I'm not a big crier, but this moving had me.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love the app! I like the set up and how you navigate on the app too. Its lacking the full 5 stars due to at times the app freezes and has force close more times than I care for. However I know that this means it can improve in time which is good. And compare to the original Apple app way big improvement and worth the wait!!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is one movie I've waited to see after reading about this great horse and the peole around him. Yes, it is a feel-good story but it actually happened and even with some loose facts the director threw into the movie it is work watching.\\"Big Red\\" was an exceptional horse and even today - no horse has ever come close to what Secretariat did at Belmont. Terrific story.

0439023513|4.0|Let me first start off by saying that this should not have been a trilogy. The Mockingjay leaves the reader feeling sad, hollow, and upset. Which I'm sure was by design, since it is to explain to young adults why their moms, dads, and sweethearts came back from war changed. I grow up in a time where i was too young to remember wars. At the time of the 9/11 attracts i was in my last year of middle school. So I saw how my friends, family members, people's sweethearts etc. ran so eagerly to join the war on terror. Only when they came back they were charged, some killed their selves, some killed their families, and then some learned how to coupe.<br /><br />In the first two books Suzanne Collins makes so much effort to make Katniss, this beyond human teenager. Collins takes the reader and shows how Prim is Katniss's world, has been her world for a very long time. However, once in the arena the outside world fades away. This is where \\"we\\" the reader meets Katniss sun. Peeta is a bright shining ray of hope. Like any world all life and energy comes from the sun. Collins shows how Katniss depends on Peeta and learns how much she needs him. While, Prim and her mother is still Katniss's world she needs more to live. So in the last the Mockingjay it is no surprise that once her sun is gone that her energy is fading her hope is dying.<br /><br />The country is at war they need Katniss the way that she needs Peeta. Katniss is the sun to the districts the hope, the spark that is needed to show the capital that they belong to themselves only that they will no longer be told how or when they will die.<br /><br />Three big things happen in the book (1) Katniss has finally broken. A small part has held on to her will to choose. (2) Coin is afraid she is Katniss is a threat to her so she destroys Katniss's world in an attempt to destroy her, Katniss. (3) Many years later a brief look of how Katniss and Peeta have coupe. This is where I have a problem. Katniss is imprisoned in her owndistrict like so many of our men and women in-arms are in their old towns, old way of life.<br />Collins did a great job showing Katniss and Peeta's strength need and roles for each other. She also did a great job of showing the downfall of all three characters- Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. However, what Collins failed to show and why I say this book is incomplete is because she fails to show the rebuilding of all three characters and the country itself. She only leaves the reader with hope that while life goes on, it will always be different and all that come after will not truly understand the impact of the event.

Lost the weight I wanted to, and am on the 3rd phase now. So far, I'm happy and satisfied and would recommend the Dukan way.
145162607X|5.0|Another great story by Phillippa Gregory, one of my favorite authors. Fantastic as always. Love the history of aspects of the cousins wars woven into an extemely plausible life of one of the more obscure players. Even if you've never had the pleasure of reading all of Gregory's books like I have, you will love this spellbinding story. The loyalty struggles of the three York brothers at the base of The Kingmaker, Warwick, and his obsession with the English crown. Anne Neville is both lovable and loathing. You decide in the end. Excellent. Five star book. Expected nothing less from this exciting writer and her historical accuracy woven  into what was and what probabky was and what could have been. Could not put it down.

B004GJDQT8|1.0|For being one of the leading internet companies, Amazon really has fallen asleep at the wheel on this one. Where is the TABLET version of your Shopping App? It's not like tablets are a &quot;new&quot; thing going on here Amazon, they have been around for a few years now. You need to make your Amazon Tablet app ASAP, as being a regular Amazon shopper and long time user... Not being able to browse my wishlists, shop, search etc... via an app and having to load a browser to use your service is obnoxious.<br /><br />This is a call to action for the Amazon App team... Tablets should take center stage for you and become a priority.<br /><br />Highly disappointed.

B008602KQI|5.0|This is easily one of the best movies of the year. I would recommend parents watching it before showing to their kids (depending on their age). There is some gore, but most of it is not visible because the screen isn't on the violence or the camera shakes a lot. Still, it's a multilayered story that begs you to read the book the minute you finish watching. I can't wait for the sequel.

B000025XKM|5.0|This album exists in a precarious balance: it is clearly the record of its artist's descent into paralyzing melancholia, but it records that arc so beautifully. Its lack of ornamentation, which may alienate some new listeners, is also its greatest virtue. This structural clarity allows the subtle lyrics to shine through. Once neglected, with the rest of Drake's body of work, this album is now rightly regarded as a rediscovered classic.<br /><br />In the unlikely event you don't already know this album, it was his last studio album, recorded by Drake alone with his guitar (he later added some piano flourishes to the title track). This allows him freedom to explore his vision, and he proves quite the guitarist. The intricate arrangement on \\"Free Ride,\\" for instance, contrasts with the austere sound of \\"Know,\\" an unvarying railroad shuffle with no dynamic variation, powered instead by Drake's \\"high lonesome\\" wail.<br /><br />His lyrical theme appears to be that he cares deeply, but can do no more than he already has. The deeply fatalistic structure of his verses comes across in lines like this, from \\"Road\\":<br /><br />You can take the road that takes you to the stars now<br />I can take the road that'll see me through<br /><br />He's granting his listeners the freedom to go on, even though he believes he's turning them loose on a fool's errand. Similarly, from \\"Harvest Breed\\":<br /><br />Falling fast and falling free you look to find a friend<br />Falling fast and falling free this could just be the end<br /><br />The collation of freedom with finality seems remarkably dark, at first blush. The moment you're free, you will die. But consider it from the other angle: the moment you die, you're free. Death need not mean bodily death, though. As in the tarot, death may mean any sudden change, the end of an old way, and the commencement of a new. Death, then, is not scary. And it's not final.<br /><br />Nick Drake scares some listeners because he isn't bound by the strictures of cultural normalcy. If you know anything of his life, he may not have even been aware that such strictures even existed. He speaks an argot that does not bend to the whims of fashion. But if you like music with an edge, and lyrics which speak perceived truth, then the very traits that alienate Nick Drake from some listeners will endear him to you.es of cultural normalcy.

It's shot at 65mm then processed onto 4k digital. The opening shots of a lava eruption both day and night shots are simply stunning. There are some disturbing shots that have to do with slaughter of chickens and pigs so keep this in mind. There are tender shots too so do not despair.

B00932AA5G|5.0|When you find a good foreign language movie, you end up watching it and not really realising that you are listening to a foreign language while reading subtitles.  In this movie it was so entertaining that this happened.  The story was so interesting, fun and full of action that the annoyance of the subtitles could be ignored.<br /><br />The casting of Aksel Hennie (an actor I have never heard of or seen before) in the lead role was physically and mentally perfect for the part.  He made me feel sorry for him even when he was being an arrogant twit, which was the point.  While Nikolaj Coster-Waldau was also perfect for his role giving even more fuel to Hennie's characters insecurities, although I did keep seeing him as his role of Jamie Lannister in Game of Thrones - a slight case of being typecast but I believe that was more in my mind than anything else.<br /><br />Some gory parts that did make me close to retching but these were very few and were necessary to the story, nothing gratuitous.  Some really funny parts that made me laugh out loud - see the cops Tweedledee and Tweedledum for reference.<br /><br />A prime example of where European movie makers do it so much better than American movie makers for making a movie realistic.  When the lead character was struggling to move the dead weight of a dead body I just knew that in the American version (if there was one) he would have been able to lift it without breaking sweat.  This along with various other realistic moments made it a really good movie.<br /><br />5 out of 5 from me and worth a watch even if you are not normally a fan of foreign language movies.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard about this book mostly through friends, and I have to say we have wildly different tastes! I cannot understand what others have found wonderful about this book. It totally mystifies me as to why such a poorly written piece would be on so many bestseller lists (found this out after I started reading). I do have to say I wasted $10, but it was my own fault for not doing my homework and reading reviews or looking up the history of the book. If I had I would have never read it knowing that it was based off of a Twilight fan fiction. I HATED TWILIGHT!!! I read and reread and reread the series trying to see what all the fuss was about and could not find out why. It still baffles me. Having not read that this was based on Twilight in its inception I did make a connection in the writing style. Both are so repetitive it's annoying and the characters are so one dimensional it makes me want to scream.<br />  Again, I knew nothing about this book before reading it and I thought it was written by a man with a very low opinion of women based on the poor character of Ana. I have read other reviews that say this or that could be changed to make this a tolerable book, however she would need a complete overhaul and character injection. I have read others that bash the character of Christian, which are not as founded in my opinion.  Yes he does need to be more upfront, but to me he is a supporting character more than a main one making the flatness almost acceptable.<br />  I have not nor will I spend money on the next two books, I learned my lesson with the Twilight series which I can just reread and let my imagination run wild. The only difference would probably be that it'd be better. I should probably mention that I am an avid horror fan with a wonderfully dark imagination, which is how I got through the book. If you like good literature, don't read this it is a waste of time and money.

She becomes rather obsessed with wolves and particularly with the yellow eyed one.<br /><br />After a boy is attacked by the wolves, people starts hunting them. When a boy, Sam, with yellow eyes shows on Grace's porch with gunshot wound she knows it's her wolf.<br /><br />I have to say I liked this much more than I thought I would. After all the hype I feared I'd be disappointed but I did enjoy it.<br /><br />The book is told by Grace's and Sam's point of view. I rather liked to see the story from two sides and even the pov switches didn't annoy me.<br /><br />I liked how she did the weather thing with wolves. When it's warm they can can shift and become human and when it's cold stay as wolves.<br /><br />Sam was bit too wishy-washy at times, and made really bad lyrics, but I thought he was so sweet. But his yellow eyes made me think Micah from Anita Blake every time. I couldn't help it!<br /><br />It was actually hard to put away at times and I'm happy I already have the next book!

I loved Shiver and I enjoyed Linger but I have to say I'm disappointed with Forever. And I wanted it to be great!<br /><br />The book is very slow and nothing happens, action or emotional wise. Sam is just moping since Grace has gone away and you would think they will have great emotional reunion but no. I didn't feel any chemistry between them and I feel like they were completely different from Sam and Grace at Shiver. I would have liked to see more of Sam and Beck and how Sam felt after hearing more about the time when he was turned.<br /><br />I felt like there was no answers but just more questions that wasn't answered. And the thing that disappointed me most was the ending. I mean how can a book end like that?! Did I miss chapter or two? It just ended!<br /><br />I'm just so sad that it had to end like this and it feels like a totally separate book from the serie.

Grace's parents seems to hate him more every time and then there's Cole, one of the new wolves Beck made in the last book. And Grace gets fever but feels that it's not just ordinary fever...<br /><br />I'm glad to say that I liked this as much as the previous one! The book is told from 4 point of views: Grace, Sam, Isabel and Cole. I think it was great addition to hear the story from Isabel's and Cole's side too. Isabel seems more \\"humane\\" since last book, she's gone through a lot since her brother died and feels guilty. At first I thought Cole was just an ass but I grew to like him.<br /><br />After Grace's parents finds Sam sleeping with Grace they freak out and starts trying to get some control over the situation. In Shiver they were never there and acted more like a teenager than Grace and then suddenly they think that Grace is supposed to do like they say. No, I don't have kids and I understand how Grace felt about that one.<br /><br />I enjoyed this but I didn't have that same feeling that I need to know right now what's gonna happen. But still very quick read!<br /><br />Can't wait to read Fever!
B005LAII58|5.0|Unlike the first installment, \\"Expendables 2\\" is no longer out to prove that a bunch of aging guys over 50 can still kick butt. The collective bad boys of 80s cinema are finally all assembled (and by that I mean ALL OF THEM) without pretense to trade quips, kill bad guys by the bucketful, and look awesome doing it. It's all pretty dumb, but then the 80s flicks were never meant to be high art.  This is pure machismo fueled by blood, sweat, and money.  I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />Stallone is back as Barney Ross, blackmailed into performing one last job at the behest of Bruce Willis' government agent Mr. Church.  The biker gang known as the Expendables loses Yin Yang (Jet Li, who exlpains that they'll \\"just have to find some other minority to pick on\\" as he parachutes out of the film.  But the other standbys are still there: Dolph Lundgren as lunatic Gunnar Jensen, Jason Statham as knife-wielding Less Christmas, Terry Crews as massive Hale Caesar, and Randy Coture as Toll Road who seems to be the only one without much to do. Maggie Chan (Yu Nan) is added in as the \\"minority to pick on\\" who can hold her own amongst all the men.  The only one missing is Mickey Rourke, but he's replaced by sniper Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid.  Billy wants to leave this rough-and-tumble life, which we know means he's doomed to serve as a tragic example for the others to kick butt and take names.<br /><br />With that setup in place, said butt-kicking begins in earnest.  Statham and Stallone trade the best lines, and their easy humor (\\"when I see you I'm going to shoot you in the face!\\") anchors the film. That doesn't make up for the fact that someone who has been around as long as Ross will fire a pistol into the air to scatter wolves (thereby alerting the enemies he knows are lurking in the area) or that playing a jukebox in an abandoned building might be a bad idea (thereby alerting the enemies he knows are lurking in the area).  The bad guys, led by Jean Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), all sport a devil insignia in the form of a goat - they even hang the sign outside of the local bar to helpfully guide our heroes as where to go to beat information out of them.<br /><br />Expendables 2 plays a lot like a bad Dungeons & Dragons scenario: go out on an adventure for treasure and glory and then, when things get rough and our heroes blunder stupidly into a situation, the Dungeon master throws in Chuck Norris.  No joke.

B000059TPN|4.0|That headliner line is not about the film - it is one of the funnier lines spoken by Nicholas Cage in this knockout movie. Almost twenty year old, this film - THE ROCK - remains one of the most entertaining and powerfully performed and produced action films in cinema history.  Re-examining It today finds it still as fresh as ever - a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with a solid story (David Weisberg, Douglas Cook, and Mark Rosner) and pitch perfect direction from Michael Bay.  Yes, there are many special effects (pyrotechnics, underwater fighting, the recreation of the bowels of Alcatraz, etc), a dialogue that allows the intervention of comic relief in a situation that seems impossible to find humor, and some very fine performances by a huge cast of actors.  It is an `escape movie', both for the audience and for the story.<br /><br />Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage, in one of his better roles), who lives in Washington D.C., is a biochemist who works for the FBI. Soon after his fianc&eacute;e Carla Pestalozzi (Vanessa Marcil) announces that she is pregnant, Stanley gets a call from FBI director James Womack (John Spencer). Womack tells Goodspeed that San Francisco's Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) who, for years, has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across. Goodspeed is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Goodspeed knows how to disarm the bombs, but he needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside and that someone is a former Alcatraz escapee James Patrick Mason (Sean Connery).  The wise and experienced Mason and the nerdy brainy but intimidated Goodspeed make an odd couple but head to Alcatraz in an attempt to foil Hummel's terrorist scheme.<br /><br />The large supportive cast is populated with such actors as David Morse, William Forsythe, Bokeem Woodbine, Danny Nucci, Claire Forlani, Jim Caviezel, John Enos III, Richard Conti, Raymond Cruz and Philip Baker Hall. It is a bit long but never fails to keep your interest.  A good old-fashioned Hollywood blockbuster action flick!

A few title cards every now and then, complementing the action with some important bit of dialog or with some back story that cannot be shown: silent-movie style, but unobtrusively done. The factor form is that of movies before wide-screen formats, same as that of the screen of an old TV.<br />There is some exaggeration of facial gestures, but less than in old dramatic silent movies where faces had to convey both emotion and some idea of what was being said but not heard by the audience. I felt that a more modern acting technique, allowing for more subtlety, was being used to that same end. The movie, by the way, is not silent: there is background music throughout, plus some ambient sounds now and then, and full sound in the closing scene. It is really very much a modern movie shown in black and white with the stage mikes turned off. In looks, it resembles more a 30's or 40's comedy than a 20's film: a sharper image (or maybe old silent movies being shown now are the dulled copies of copies of copies), and more outdoor scenes.<br />Unlike the old silent movies that were filmed at a lower frame rate than modern ones, and later were modified by repeating frames in order to be projected with modern equipment, which made them look jerky, the motion here is about as smooth as in any contemporary movie -- and as it really was when silent movies were shown with the intended equipment, back in their day. Actually, \\"The Artist\\" was filmed at a slightly lower rate than the usual 24 frames per second, to give it an antique feel, but I did not noticed it.<br />It has been rated PG 13 because of one lonely finger gesture and some heavy drinking by the leading male character to drown his sorrows for being: (a) made redundant by the start of the talkies, (b) ruined after financing an expensive film project that failed, (c) thrown out of his rich girlfriend's house, and (d) hit by the Great Depression while just out of work, all more or less at once. His drinking is heavy but not disgusting - i.e.: not quite realistic, done with a very light touch, as in old-fashioned movies.<br />Third, the two main actors: both excellent and very good looking; in fact, the actress is a rare, pure-blood beauty. They both have great smiles, although these diminish as the action grows darker towards the middle, and come back in full radiance at the end. And both do some pretty decent tap dancing, that they practiced for five months to get it right.<br />And last, but not least, there is the little dog Uggie, which should have got an Oscar --or at least his trainer should.<br />Fourth, the story: if you saw \\"Singin' in the Rain\\", it is more or less the same idea told silent-movie style and in black and white. Not classic-movie stuff like that one, in my view, but enjoyable nevertheless.<br />Certainly enjoyable enough that I do not regret seeing it and felt well served after doing so: good enough entertainment for those who go to see it with an open mind.
B008G33NFC|5.0|\\"ACT 1\\" is already released over here  in Europe & on Amazon UK in all formats.Its advance promo gave promise of an unforgettable spectacular, and that's exactly what Tarja, her band and \\"back-line\\" crew have delivered here. As you can see from the set list , she had so many strong tracks to capture -from her first 2 studio albums plus a third now in the works- that the 2hrs 45 of concert footage is actually from 2 concerts over consecutive nights in the same theatre ,with partly varying set lists.<br /><br />Live concert videos really just don't come any better than this. Tarja's choice of the venerable Teatro El Circulo( Rosario, Argentina)is a truely inspired one, with its stack of five packed out \\"dress circles\\" towering up to the surreal giant \\"eye\\" of the circular ceiling that got the theatre its name. Add a laser-light show that fits perfectly with every number,hire a camera team who really know their craft (and DONT try to \\"upstage\\" with  editing-deck gimmickry)and it all feels about as close as it gets to \\"being there\\" - short of actually being there, of course !<br /><br />You just may have seen a promo clip saying \\"Act 1\\" is \\"One Hundred Percent Live \\".Tarja explains in her Blog this just means the sound was not \\"enhanced\\" afterwards- what they played is what you hear.It was not intended to come across as \\"all you hear was played live on the night\\".So don't expect any extra  orchestra/choir joining Tarja's normal touring band on stage. Even so, the only \\"non live\\" elements that were obvious to  me were some \\"heavenly choirs\\" in two or three  of the set list - and I'm sure these  work far better this way than having an actual choir standing around on stage with nothing to do 90% of the time!<br /><br />It's  the size and adaptability of Tarja's band that enables \\"Act 1\\" to be as near an all-live performance as it is .To drums, base and keyboards she adds cello and no less than three lead guitars - one also doubles as a second solid base where needed, similarly her keys man doubles as \\"second cello\\". Now and then,  Tarja herself pitches in on grand piano and keys.It all cranks up to be not just one of the heaviest metal \\"attacks\\" on tour anywhere, but also a band probably more able than any other to reproduce  the classic/ symphonic elements of any studio album live on stage.<br /><br />One \\"quirk\\" on first play might amuse- just after half way through DVD 1,Tarja introduces In For A Kill as \\"our last song for tonight\\",then there is another last song  & encore from the second night at the end of DVD 1, followed by a final ten more numbers on DVD2. This actually all works very well for the DVD format- though IF the single Blu Ray disk sticks to the exact same running order, that might not feel quite so right there.<br /><br />\\"Extras\\" on DVD2 mostly features a decent length session Tarja of answering a range of questions ,and in a way that  sheds some new light on (her own words) \\"the person behind the artist\\".<br /><br />The sound and visual quality in the DVD format I opted for is superb. Hopefully the same will also go for the Blu-Ray this time around-one review did report issues with that format of the previous \\"Tarja & Harus\\" video, like \\"Act 1\\" here an Ear Music Release)<br /><br />\\"Act 1 \\" will be one hard act to follow,but it also leaves you both hoping and expecting that ,in time, Tarja will indeed do exactly that. A clear \\"must-have\\" for all Tarja fans, plus anyone else with an ear for innovative heavy music without boundaries.<br /><br />(The Full Setlist for 2-DVD option is down in the Editorial Review in the Product Info.  As of today the Info indicates it is only a single DVD, this must be an Amazon typo as there is in fact no single DVD variant either on release , or planned. Only the Blu-Ray is a single disk.Most but not all numbers are also in the 2-CD pack, only available separately from the Video formats)

B008K7WCJM|5.0|Good grief. I mean, holy shit.  I'm a little drunk, and in the middle of my third listen through this devastating work of art that is The Seer.  This is a brilliant, filthy, terrifying and ecstasy-inducing experience.  I wasn't even a huge fan of Swans, my first listen being ....Rope to the Sky in 2010, which I thought was pretty interesting.  What we have here is a soul-crushing, hypnotic journey into madness.  Think of the earth crashing into the sun, or a black hole swallowing an entire solar system, and you'll begin to understand how massive the emotions belonging to this work truly are.  30 years in the making sounds just about right.  Are you new to Swans?  Well, I suggest some very patient listening.  If you're at all willing and interested, you will receive 10-fold your effort in return.

B004SEUJ82|5.0|\\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is a superb, deeply moving film.  It tells the story of two boys who become friends, despite tremendous social and physical barriers.  The story is told from the point of view of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of an SS Officer.  When the family must move due to Father's work, Bruno meets Schmuel, a boy like him, who is also eight.  But why does Schmuel live on such a strange farm?  And why do the farmers all wear pyjamas?<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Asa Butterfield's performance as Bruno is particularly memorable; his portrayal of an eight-year-old boy contains just the right amount of innocence.  David Thewlis is excellent as Father; he comes across as a gentle man, while simultaneously making us hate him.  And Vera Farmiga is very believable in her role as Mother, who always knows more than she lets on to Bruno, and probably more than she admits to herself.<br /><br />The story is mainly told from Bruno's point of view.  Thus, most of the atrocities take place off-screen.  Still, the movie manages not to downplay the horror of the Holocaust.  The audience always knows what is really going on, at least if they have any familiarity with the history at all.  Somehow, the film manages to be deeply disturbing without being graphic at all.<br /><br />As others have noted, the film is unrealistic.  The fence around camp, for instance, seems to be strangely unguarded.  However, unlike other Holocaust films such as Schindler's List, this movie does not aim for realism.  Instead, it is highly symbolic.  Symbols of the holocaust permeate the film.  In one scene, a pile of naked dolls invokes the images of the Holocaust that we have all seen (piles of hair, shoes, eyeglasses, corpses).  And the electric fence reminds us that, whatever barriers are created between different peoples, the innocence of children will always surmount them.  It feels almost like a parable or fable (it's short length is appropriate in this regard).  As such, therealism is sometimes sacrificed for the sake of the plot.  But if we can suspend our disbelief, the true horror of the Holocaust will become even more apparent.  The symbolism says everything; the whole message of the film is contained in one shot in which two characters hold hands.<br /><br />Finally, I will offer my take on the age-appropriateness of the film.  Some people believe that this film is a good way to introduce kids to the Holocaust.  I disagree.  I think kids should first see real images of the Holocaust and learn the real history before viewing a work of fiction (especially one that does not aim for historical accuracy).  Since the atrocities normally take place off camera, and much of the plot is implied rather than overtly stated, I think it would only confuse kids who haven't already been introduced to the subject-matter.  That said, if kids do have a good understanding of the Holocaust already, I think they should view this film.  They will be disturbed by it, but that's exactly what any film about the Holocaust should do.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this film.  I think anyone old enough to have learned the history of the Holocaust should see it.  Literally, it's a story about two boys who become friends despite tremendous social and physical barriers.  But the image at the end reminds us that it stands for something much bigger, and of the millions of innocents who suffered a terrible fate.
B007L6VQHW|5.0|*Note* **There is actually more that goes with this review on my blog since I saw an advance screening of Lawless in the beginning of August and met the author of the book this movie is based on, Matt Bondurant. Matt's grandfather is Jack Bondurant (played by Shia LaBeouf) and Howard and Forrest were his granduncles. To read my full post on meeting Matt and getting to talk to him about how his family saga got turned into a movie, do a google search for The Muses Circle, click on Movie Reviews, and scroll down to Lawless.**<br /><br />I absolutely have nothing negative to say about Lawless. Some critics have complained that while the acting was top notch, the story itself was derivative. Are there elements of the plot that we've seen in other films before? Yes. But does is straight up copy another movie? No. But let's get it straight. The point of Lawless was never to give us something we've completely never seen before. Come on, this is not the Matrix. Hillcoat's vision was to give us a twist on the gangster genre, give us something a little less conventional. So while there were elements that felt familiar, there were also scenes that you just didn't expect; scenes that perhaps you expected to go one way, but ended up playing out completely different. I have a couple scenes in mind but I don't want to spoil anything.<br /><br />In my opinion, Nick Cave did a great job with the script and the soundtrack. I liked Jack's bits of narration throughout the film. The movie was well paced-- my mind never wandered nor did I feel bored. So if some of you are hesitating to see Lawless because you're worried that the action or scenes of violence are far and wide between, you have nothing to worry about. Cave is more known as a song writer and composer then he is for writing scripts. So I had a feeling the soundtrack was going to be interesting. It was a breath of fresh air. Instead of going with the traditional sound of straight up blue grass, country music (remember this movie is part western, part gangsteresque), he somehow mixed in some new with some old.<br /><br />Now to the outstanding cast of Lawless. You may disagree with everything I've said so far, but one thing that cannot be denied is the amazing acting in this film, even for those who have less screen time. I'll be the first to admit I am not a Shia LaBeouf fan. Walking into this movie, I thought I was going to have to just ignore him and pray the other actors would be able to carry him. While I still won't be the first person lined up to see his next movie, I have to give credit where credit is due: Shia LaBeouf can act. From his southern drawl to his convincing performance as a boy that still hasn't quite transitioned into manhood, I think he did a great job playing Jack Bondurant.<br /><br />Jason Clarke who portrays the eldest brother in the Bondurant clan Howard, was a bit overshadowed by other performances, but I won't soon forget those eyes. They are eyes that have seen things that no man should ever have the burden of seeing and it's no surprise why he drowns himself in moonshine. The way Clarke was able to sometimes appear \\"tuned out\\" out was impressive.<br /><br />Gary Oldman as gangster Floyd Banner was electrifying, but shorter then expected. It's one of those cases where Hollywood uses an actor's name to draw people into the film, but they aren't actually in the majority of it.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain is a great actress so I wasn't surprised by her solid, strong female performance as Maggie. I loved how she could walk into a room and instantly remind the rough-around-the-edges Bondurant boys of their manners in the presence of a lady. The other lady in the movie, Mia Wasikowska, who plays Bertha (Jack's love interest) was as perfect as always. She is young but can hang with the heavyweights as she has proven in previous performances in Jane Eyre and Albert Nobbs.<br /><br />If you are looking for a villain you will hate as much as the characters do in the film, then you will love Guy Pearce's spin on Special Deputy Rake. Pearce is probably one of the most underrated but brilliant actors around and I am glad that the part went to him since Rake as a character is quite interesting. He's from the city, wears perfume, appears to look the part of a gentlemen but we soon realize underneath the nice clothes, coifed hair, and girly smell, there's something not quite...right. Like the gloves he wears and the naked African American girl in his room that he has sitting on newspapers on top of his bed. Yeah...check it out, you will see what I mean.<br /><br />I think the character that I least expected to connect with was Cricket and the credit has to go to Dane DeHaan. I kept thinking he was the younger version of Leonardo DeCaprio and I don't know why but his performance in Lawless reminded me of DeCaprio as Arnie in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. The physical likeness of the two is uncanny. I can't wait to see DeHaan evolve over time.<br /><br />Okay, so I had to save the best for last. I promise to keep my praise of this next actor as short as possible since there are really no words that can fully describe his performance. You just need to see it. Tom Hardy was compelling as Forrest Bondurant, the middle brother and the head of the family. I read somewhere that the director John Hillcoat was \\"awestruck\\" by Hardy's performance. I think I was awestruck when I saw Hardy as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, but let me say this: I don't need any more proof, he is a phenomenal actor. Any actor that can wear a Mr. Rogers' cardigan and remain sexy, masculine, and still be the baddest dude on screen is just amazing. Hardy always makes Forrest appear relaxed, yet intense. His mannerisms such as the way he walks, talks is a pleasure to watch. Forrest is the glue that keeps everything in his world together and I am not just talking about his importance as the businessman in the family. Forrest has to keep a watchful eye on his older brother Howard who can fly off the handle in a second, who can at times appear tuned out and sometimes wonder if it is all from the moonshine or from the horrors he saw at war. Then on the other end is young Jack, his baby brother that he knows isn't quite cut out for the lifestyle but knowing and trying to convince the youngest in the Bondurant family are two different beasts. I'm not saying Forrest couldn't have been played by another actor, but Tom Hardy brought something special to the character that could never be replicated.<br /><br />I think John Hillcoat has succeeded in his goal. He has given us a western/gangster flick that feels familiar yet still maintains its freshness. If you're looking for a film with a solid story, great acting, with nicely paced bursts of violence, look no further. Lawless has arrived. But let us not give all the credit to Hollywood for there would be no movie without Matt Bondurant and his novelization of his grandfather and granduncle's legend sized escapades. I read somewhere that Matt Bondurant's one regret was that he never spent enough time with his grandfather as so often happens with young people. That maybe writing Wettest County in the World was his way to honor the memory of the man he knew and the man he wished he had had the time to get to know. Don't worry, Matt. Grandpa Jack would be proud.<br /><br />Mia @ themusescircle.blogspot.comlm, then you will love Guy Pearce's spin on Special Deputy Rake.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I did not read the books therefore I'm not a fanboy with huge preconceived expectations. Nor do I cherry nit-pick here and there, until it completely ruins the whole experience.<br /><br />This is what I got out of the movie. The violence was more of an secondary aspect. The main gist is how out of touch and how ridiculous the citizens of The Capitol are. Totalitarian dictators sending kids off to their doom then applauding, laughing, and cheering them on whilst the kids are in complete dread. It's just a game show for them.  Complete with clever marketing and pseudo storylines concocted for mass media consumption. Think Jersey Shore or Keeping up with the Kardasians, typical mass marketed trash TV. Combine Gladiator + 1984 + trash TV and you get The Hunger Games. An average girl, in an dystopian future, obtaining the hope and courage to rise up against intolerant wealth and tyranny.

0345803485|2.0|I am on the 2nd book.  I'm reading it out of curiousity, as ALL of my co-workers (female) have read it and went on and on about it.  The first complaint is that this \\"writer\\" repeats words over and over and over! Crap, Holy crap, Holy shit, ghost of a smile, delicious, he blanched, I flushed. Those are all repeated again and again until I got so focused on them I was too irritated to feel the scene. For God's sake, get a thesaurus or something! Anastasia flushes more than a public toilet! She is, JUST LIKE BELLA, massively self absorbed and not very likeable at all.  We can assume she's beautiful despite her low self image and complete cluelessness. She acts like a high school level girl. She is graduating college yet has never been drunk, had sex, or even kissed a boy ever? Possible but a little unusual.  Christian speaks like someone from a previous century. He actually says \\"shall\\" as in \\"Come, Miss Steele, I shall take you there now.\\" Hello? I mean Edward talked that way because he WAS from another century! What's this guy's excuse? I believe this is actually unhealthy for younger women. Ana is weak, naive and lets herself be dominated (under feeble protest). The characters are a complete rip off of Twilight. I would've sued her if I were the Twilight author (who also cannot write her way out of a paperbag, but at least had a good plotline).  Also, by book 2 the shock of the sex has worn off and becomes redundant and BORING. Also, by halfway through book number two, we are still only weeks into the relationship! How will they ever make a movie based on inner thoughts of a simple minded girl and her excessive sex with a weird guy in a 2 week span of time? I can't imagine this! This woman did not even create her own characters and her writing skill is at high school level at best. It's very sad that she's gotten rich off of this \\"crap\\" (as Anastasia would say!)

B008W12UQG|5.0|The Good:<br />OK, like all the rest of you guys, I was thinkin' why? Why \\"revamp/re-release\\" a record thats already great...argguably even KISS's greatest work? Well, when it was all said and done, the bottom line for me was, I grew up on Destroyer, Love Gun, R&R Over, and ALIVE II. So, I simply wanted to hear Ezrins fresh influence on what he knows is one of his master acheivements... and of course the pressure you know he was feeling of Many very devoted fans who are dogmatic about perfection in such matters...Dangerous scinario!!! Well, I bought it. I keep playin' it. I think its tramendous! Very well done. Still the same teriffic album with a touch of new light. Its very much like having an old painting restored... there are colors and details you never knew were there! He has taken an old album and made it new again! Its fresh and suddenly \\"meatier\\" than its ever been. Its easily worth the $9 bucks I payed for it. I hear hi-hats I never heard before, great bass drum notes that are more blatant, background vocals, echoes, suddle sound effects... its still DESTROYER... but in some ways, it destroy's destroyer!<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I admit the \\"Flaming Youth\\" error (a missing half-measure coming into the song just before the snare drum) had me frustrated. Actually, Im still a little frustrated every time I hear it. I love that song and the new life it seems to have in the remix. Which makes the skip all that much worse. To liken this picture to my above statements: That newly restored painting I was just taliking about, has a noticible 3 inch tear in the middle of the damn thing!!!  ...still love the painting. HATE the tear. A brand new record, with a skip I cant take out by placing a penny on the needle!!! because of this, it gets 4 instead of 5 stars.
0062082353|5.0|The other night, watching the show \\"Stars Earn Stripes\\", my son recognized Chris Kyle, the author of \\"The American Sniper\\", a biography he read for a school assignment. Curious about it, I picked up the book and browsed through it. Needless to say, I finished it in 1 and 1/2 days.<br /><br />I come from a country where patriotism used to be forced down our throat on a daily basis, a continuous lie the communists told us for generations. The result of it? We all hated it.<br />After moving to the US I always wondered what drives Americans to stand when the national anthem is played before each game. What unseen force tells them to fly their flag, high on a mast, for the world to see it, for the wind to dance with it. What drives them to enroll in the military, leaving all they love and their family and make the ultimate sacrifice.<br />Chris Kyle's autobiography answers to all these questions and more. As Chris explains it, it's God, country and family. It's being selfless and the need to protect all that you inherit from your forefathers, believe in, all that you have, and all that you are.<br />American Sniper is Chris Kyle's account on the Iraq war where he's deployed 4 times. To most people one time is more than enough. You serve your country, do your duty the best you can and then return home. But not for Chris. He needed to be there among his fellow countrymen, covering them, taking fire for them and protecting them with his life if it meant that was the last thing he'd do.<br />What media presented (and I should say manipulated) about the war in Iraq is by far different than Chris' view on it. We American's didn't go there to, as Chris says, \\"bring democracy to Iraq\\". We went there to protect fellow countrymen, fight for our country not Iraq. It's a war that politicians deemed necessary, not our soldiers. They only followed orders.<br />As a kid Chris had always dreamt to join the military. A dream he'd fulfilled, lived and finally shared memories of it by writing this biography. It's written from Chris' point of view, concise and detailed, a progressive narration of war seen through a soldier's eyes. From time to time his wife Taya pitched in, giving us an insight of what a family goes through while their loved ones is at war, the constant fear, the anguish, the frustrations. The biography tells untold stories of unknown heroes. It doesn't sugarcoat, doesn't use fancy words and artistic scenes. There's nothing artistic about the war.<br />Like you and I doing our job, that's what Chris did: his job. People might or might not agree with his cold-blooded attitude toward the people he killed. But before you throw that stone let me ask you something: if you disagree with Chris why didn't you stand to protect this country?<br />God Bless America!
0765316994|4.0|John Scalzi has an incredible knack for writing novels that read effortlessly, smoothly and all too quickly. While \\"Redshirts\\" doesn't build a world as robust and realistic as the universe in his military-focused \\"Old Man's War\\" series, Scalzi has written another terrifically creative and engaging work.<br /><br />Scalzi's wit drives a plot centered on the concept that secondary characters in sci fi entertainment tend to die (frequently) so that their senior officers (and show/movie/book stars) will live. The story is propelled by Scalzi's insights on the human condition as well as the entertainment industry.<br /><br />The concept is not new to sci fi fans - the title of Scalzi's book draws from the standard uniform color of expendable characters on \\"Star Trek\\" whose deaths, as Scalzi points out, \\"are a feature, not a bug\\". Scalzi uses the foundation of this small premise and builds a credible and interesting world. He avoids the standard and expected clichés and has developed a fully realized, nuanced and captivating novel.<br /><br />I didn't find the characters in \\"Redshirt\\" as three dimensional as those in Scalzi's \\"Old Man's War\\" series. I acknowledge, though, that he had several books with which to build those up as opposed to the single 300+ pages in \\"Redshirts\\". The strongest character development comes within the three codas Scalzi attaches to the end of the primary narrative to bring to conclusion some of the more poignant, but less central, plot elements of his story.<br /><br />As usual, Scalzi's characters are smartly written and imbued with a cynical, insightful, but never over-written, sense of humor. \\"Redshirts\\" is strewn with inside jokes on modern entertainment, many at the expense of agents, writers and the business-side of Hollywood business. I often found the tone similar to Scalzi's approach in his novel, \\"Agent to the Stars.\\"<br /><br />\\"Redshirts\\" made me chuckle, and Scalzi's fluid writing style and strong story development drove me to devour the book in only a couple of days.
1451673442|5.0|When I saw the title: \\"The Secret The Magic\\" I was so excited to read it. It keeps me on track and ALWAYS helps when I've had a rough day. I'm a stay-at-home mom and sometimes just need encouragement and to know that I have what it takes, as does everyone else, to create for myself a Magical Life. Thanks for making it available at such a reasonable price!!! Love this book!!!
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I purchased this app because od its interface and getting rid of ads only costs 99 cents. After a couple of weeks, current time on the display started being a few hours off, and setting doesn't let me to set time manually. You can only set your location. Well, that resetting my location didn't fix the time. Then the display broke completely and showed some illegible time, missing numbers in hour, minute, and second position.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I'm 100% positive off my username/password and it wont let me sign in. keeps coming up as invalid. this is a tad ridiculous
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is so awesome it may be better than wheres my water!!!!!its the best game ever i play it all the time
B00846REIS|4.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B008R9TX2C Play House: An erotic love story (Complete)]], I certainly like my love scenes to be frequent and very hot. But, I found that, although Bared to You was beautifully written, I needed more of a build up to the relationship between Gideon and Eva.  I think Sandra Day is an extremely talented writer so I was surprised that I didn't like the characters much. The love story was missing the love.  Gideon was too crass and Eva too immature to make the love story really resonate for me.  Still, I will read the next book because I wouldn't miss it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love how you can choose music that you have on you device. I set mine to my favorite song. I also love how you can disable snooze. I need mine disabled to ensure that I get out of bed. I also love how you can just choose an artist and it plays a random song by them so you dont get the same song everyday. The math problem to disable is good. It ensures that you are actually awake. Which is a definite plus. Also it includes a great timer. This is a really great app and very custumizable. You can choose the display color and sound. Best alarm app I found. Hopefully I wont have trouble waking up this year.
B00466HM28|4.0|I love the fact it's really really light (2 pounds) and very small (similar to my 13' Macbook air). I can just toss it in my bag and carry it wherever I go.<br /><br />The keys, though, do feel very cheap when played. And they are smaller than standard ones. It's as though I'm playing a $10 toy piano for kids. That's the bad. But I can see that the sensitivity of the keys is actually not bad.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy, because it's the portability that I'm after and it delivers.
B008602KQI|5.0|This dvd is amazing. It has good quality and it also has an amazing deal, .which you can't miss. I highly recommend it.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was an eye-opener for me on the French involvement of containment camps during World War II.  The precious story of the brother and sister was heart-wrenching.  An excellent and quick read.  My heart was completely into it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|had to wipe my kindle andlost all my notes except for the ones in this app.  def worth the price of free.  highly recommend.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I have no doubt that this is a great program...but if you don't have a dual core processor in your remote computer, forget it. This should be listed in the description and it is not. I had difficulty getting it to work because the instructions don't clearly state that you have to be sgned into \\"Streamer\\" and the program with the same e-mail account. I had to read a review to find that out. Also, there are numorous programs like this one that are free. I'll have to find one that works for me.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|A simple, smart concept that is always entertaining. A great mix of simpler puzzles with more challenging levels - and enough levels to keep you entertained for quite some time. I love this game!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I tried other apps w/ my Kindle Fire and nothing worked until this one came along! I love getting on Pinterest now!
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Critic Roger Ebert was quite correct when he said that whichever Indiana Jones movie had been released first, that one would have been considered the best (okay, maybe not Temple of Doom!). Raiders Of The Lost Ark was fresh, original, and exciting. And like all adventure series, any follow-ups to the original almost always have to pale in comparison with the first, because they are all going to be, to some degree, derivative: hero gets into seemingly inextractable situations, hero gets himself out, with the requisite fight scenes, chase scenes, etc. Can anyone name an adventure series that gets better as more films are made? You know what you are getting before you go into the theater (or before you put your DVD into the machine), so why are so many people complaining because Crustal Skull is not particularly original? You don't go to an Indiana Jones film for originality. You go to see the hero get himself in and out trouble; you go for the fight scenes; you go for the chase scenes. Crystal Skull has them all. If that's not what you want, watch a different movie.
B005LAIHPE|2.0|The plot was too predictable.  Taylor Kitsch started out as a hippie who has disappointed most everyone time and time again, and later on saves the world and became the hero.  How predictable is that!<br /><br />Things I don't get:<br />a) how was he promoted so quickly in the Navy?<br />b) how aliens who has technology to travel light years can't figure out our \\"Art of War\\" strategy?<br />c) why the alien's weakness was so easily unraveled?<br />d) how the Missouri and crew were so easily moved out of the harbor? How was the ammunition obtained?<br />e) why the aliens didn't have their own long-distance communication device and had to use ours?<br />f) if extinction was the goal, why won't the 3 alien ships just blast away all the destroyers trapped in the hemisphere to begin with?<br /><br />Verdict: not the effort to watch.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There is nothing better! I love, love, love it. So many great ideas!!!<br />Definitely a great site for all of us Moms!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My daughter recommended Fifty Shades so I read it!  Great and believable characters that you can't forget.  I appreciate the female lead character.  After I read the first one I had to read the other two.
1612930263|5.0|I think this was one of the most insightful books i've read so far in my quest to understand how the mind works. Im reading it for the third time in less than a month. \\"my new favorite book'
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Just what I was looking for. Gives plenty of info without being confusing. It shows how many hours are left on the charge which is really great.
1619491370|5.0|I loved this book.  The main character, Pollyanna changed people's lives.  She made people really friendly.  She made people happy because of her \\"glad game\\".  It taught me that I can always find things to be glad about in my life.  I also learned from this book that if you see a car, don't cross the road.  Pollyanna thought it was a safe distance but the car ended up hitting her.  My favorite part was when Aunt Polly changed.  I really liked when she let the dog and cat on the bed after the accident.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|The movie was fantastic, ecspecially in 3D. It was just as enthralling as the first movie that I got to escape in as a child. It's perfect for children and adults that fell in love with Dr.Suess books and are now able to enjoy them in eye captivating movies.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Another masterful tale by Khaled Hosseini that I am bound to not do a bit of justice to with my words. In the midst of the story, there is a conversation between two of the characters where the idea of \\"perspective\\" is brought up. I was thinking during that scene that Khaled was really talking to me (aka the reader) because that is just one of the many lessons that I will be walking away with after reading this story...which I gobbled up in just two sittings. If the Kite Runner was one of your favorite books (and if you haven't read the Kite Runner yet, um, you should. Immediately.) then you will be kicking yourself for waiting so long to pick up \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\" This man knows how to weave characters and story lines seemlessly. I love that the story follows real life events starting in the late 70's to the present. There are times when the starting date of a chapter would be \\"1992\\" and I can recall being in elementary school, talking about the bombings in Kabul, and at that time having little understanding of the people, the children, the children my age, living through that horror. PERSPECTIVE. It is a humbling and inspiring thing.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|i love this game. its installed on 2 tablets and my phone. i just wish they would give more levels...
B006RUJST6|4.0|A very easy read, with many great ideas & meanings for one to live by.  We need more people live Julia to show us what real life should be about. I hope to read the sequel soon.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Easy to learn, challenging, and does not ask for you to buy something or another to actually play the game.
0345803485|1.0|Decided to read it find out what all the hoopla was about.  Instead of what I was expecting, I found poor editing, extreme repetition, and unbelievable characters/plot line.
B0074MZSPO|3.0|let me be clear, I think the band is great and the songs are good and Brittany Howards' voice has the potential to sound AMAZING but for some reason they chose to put her vocals through some sort of effects processor and the result is just plain sad.<br />Why would anyone want to dampen the power of this womans voice? Some people claim it's because they were going for a \\"vintage sound\\" but I completely disagree, I listen to plenty of vintage records and this is not a vintage sound, in fact it sounds more like the distortion effect that was popular with bands in the early 90's.<br />The music is heavy on reverb but a little thin sonically. If you want to hear the REAL potential of this band check out their \\"Live At Third Man Records\\" 7\\" and you will see what this record could have been.<br /><br />The songs are a mix of soul rock and rockabilly and for the record, sound almost NOTHING like Janis Joplin.<br />The songs are good, the band is good but the production and mix don't make you want to hear it more than a couple times.
030758836X|4.0|A great book that is full of mystery and intrquie. A young couple, thrown together by seemingly good fate, soon find their world crashing down. Financially at wits end, they buy a bar and move to his hometown.<br /><br />Anything else would be a spoiler. I thought the ending needed some more kick.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|They finally fixed the glitches with this game.  It is a really enjoyable game as long as you are patient. enough to wait for your energy to recharge.
0525478817|5.0|John Green is one of those talented authors who can make you fall in love with a fictional character. While reading The Fault in our Stars, you will, no doubt, fall in love with Augustus Waters' character. If you are even thinking about reading this hilarious yet heart-breaking book, buy it immediately and get to reading!
034580404X|5.0|I never read books EVER! I couldn't put this down. I finished it in 3 days then ran out an bought the second. Now I'm forcing my boyfriend to pick the third up on his way home. It's definatley a must read.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I Love it. It is very addicting I could and can play this for hours and my kids love it too
B008GAV6YA|5.0|What a great book! I love that this cute board book explains the 'story' of going to the potty - recognizing the urge, wondering what to do next, waiting, finally going, etc. My daughter actually found solace in this book while we mistakenly used a shame-inducing potty-training technique that did not work for her at all (the one described in THE POTTY BOOT CAMP: Basic Training For Toddlers). While that technique set us back significantly, this book has helped get us back on track. My daughter looks at the pictures in \\"Potty\\" intently and will actually \\"read\\" the book on her own. If your kid really wants to understand how to do something before s/he does it, then this book is for you!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I am very picky with what I read and Gillian Flynn has not disappointed! Looking forward to a fourth novel.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can hardly describe this book as \\"good literature\\". According to my taste, this is an erotic novel which is entertaining but does not even motivate me to read the other two books of the trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its great and lots of fun to play on my free time.  Its my favorite app.  There's so many games to play.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Omg I got this book from amazon and it was so fast to download and cheaper then all shops.i will always from amazon now best ever service.
B008GFI4KY|5.0|Hot Cakes is quintessential The Darkness.<br /><br />If you like Permission to Land and One Way Ticket to Hell (or even Hot Leg), you will absolutely love this one.<br /><br />In my opinion, there wasn't a single weak track on Permission to Land, but Ticket to Hell had a few ones that were just not up to par with their first record. Hot Cakes is closer to Permission to Land in that every single track is absolutely killer. The band sound happy, cohesive, and charged. Even the Radiohead cover which is given a complete makeover, turned out great. Completely rocking. I can't think of another record in recent time in this genre that works as well as this one does.
B0084B1T8Y|2.0|I liked it, but it was  so dry. I only barely finished it, I'm sorry if my review isn't what you'd expect
1594135851|4.0|Collins is capable of magnificent things.  She showed us this with The Hunger Games and did not fail to show us again with Catching Fire.<br /><br />The characters are wonderfully developed, each unique and full of depth.  Katniss and Peeta are a great team and keep you wondering what they will do next or more so, say next.  You just can't help but love them.<br /><br />Collins sets up the story perfectly for the gripping conclusion that makes you want to jump for the next book immediately.  (Which I will be doing right away!)<br /><br />My main complaint about this segment is the plot is very similar to the first book, except this one is slower paced.  The first two parts jump months at a time, and it feels like most of the book is told instead of shown until we hit the action.  However, when the action hits in the third part of the story it really hits.<br /><br />Even with the few drawbacks, this was a very absorbing read, and I cannot wait to read the next segment of this series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is the best game for kids and adults that are always on electronics because it makes your brain work while you play this game.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was a random purchase & I'm so glad I bought it. I loved it, it's such a sweet story. Also as a music lover, I thought the Avett brothers quotes were a great touch. READ THIS BOOK!
B0055Q5F36|4.0|What's to protect? The device has gorilla glass already; pretty much negating the need for a plastic cover. If you do something bad enough to the glass to hurt it, a screen protector will not help.
1594744769|4.0|As a child, Jacob was fascinated by the photographs and elaborate stories his grandfather told of the peculiar children who inhabited the orphanage where he grew up on an island off the coast of Wales. Eventually, Jacob realizes his grandfather's stories could not possibly be true. Then, at the age of 16, he witnesses the murder of his grandfather in the woods. The murderer fits the exact description of an inhuman monster straight from the stories. Jacob decides to visit to the orphanage where his grandfather spent most of his childhood to see for himself that the tales have been figments of his imagination. Once he arrives on the island, Jacob finds there was more truth than fiction in the stories his grandfather had told about the orphanage.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is Ransom Riggs' first novel, and it is young adult fiction. The novel is a New York Times bestselling novel in the category of children`s chapter books. It is an ALA Teens' Top Ten Nominee for 2012.  Riggs is currently writing a sequel, which is rumored to be released in spring of 2013. As well as a sequel, fans anticipate a film adaptation. 20th Century Fox has purchased the film rights, but so far, a release date has not been set. Tim Burton has agreed to direct the film, which almost guarantees that the film will be a success. Jane Goldman, who is best known for writing films such as X-Men: First Class (2011), Kick-Ass (2010), and The Woman in Black (2012), will write the screenplay. A cast has not been chosen, but with Burton on the film, the selections are not likely to disappoint.<br /><br />The story was heavily supported by vintage photographs of peculiar children, making it stand out from other YA novels on the shelves. I typically find photographs in novels pointless, but I thoroughly enjoyed the visual elements in Peculiar Children. Without the photographs, the book probably would not have had enough success to stand next to John Green's The Fault in our Starsor Rick Riordan's The Son of Neptune.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book, I did not read the novel that was advertised on the dust jacket. The plot was interesting, but it may have disappointed readers expecting a story filled with monsters. However, if you dive into the novel without expectations, the story will capture your attention. After reading the novel, I see that if the summary printed on the book had given an accurate description, it would have ruined much of the suspense.<br /><br />Riggs' novel had similar elements to those of Scott Westerfeld's Midnighter's trilogy. Without giving too much away, I would say Riggs and Westerfeld both play with the concept of time in ways that intrigue the reader.<br /><br />The novel also has a style that mirrors Lemony Snicket, but for a slightly older audience. People who read The Series of Unfortunate Events as children will most likely enjoy Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.

B0007MA9QQ|3.0|I had the original one on dvd and lent it out to a forman at work.  I got laid off and he never gave it back.  I ordered this one from Amazon and it is pretty much the same but, the part with the Dems grilling Condalisa Rice was cut down.  Fortunately, I was able to get the original version again used from my local library used book store!  The cover on the original is different also!  It is a picture of the White House instead of Michael Moore.  Anyone who distrust repukes as much as we the people, who elected President Obama into office, should purchase this!  If you are not a bush hater, I guarantee after watching this you will be.  I highly recommend it.  God bless America and the Democratic Party!
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|It can take only one movie that will turn me away from ever watching the actor in anything else.  For Liam Nielsen this is it.  This film represents the arrogant point of view of the U.S. secular film industry as art. The idea that meaningful dialogue always has to include the 'F' word is demeaning itself as a filler for an abject poverty of dialogue.  Only in the 21st century has cursing considered part of literature.  Corse language demeans literature.  Any actor that considers it art is not an artist.  This film also represents the secular Hollywood philosophy.  Life sucks and then you die while cursing God.  I would rather call this movie a \\"Wolf's Free Lunch in Alaska\\".  Oh by the way if Hollywood wants to take artist license with the difference between day and night in wilderness of Alaska that's okay by me.  In the winter most of the day its dark, in summer most of the day is light. Do not watch this movie if you are seeking the meaning of life.  It is not entertainment; it's garbage.
0525478817|4.0|I read this book in one night. I didn't stop, save to go to the bathroom.<br />I had never read a John Green book prior to reading the Fault in Our Stars and had few expectations.<br />Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.<br />Unlike other stories featuring the cancer stricken, this book was about people with cancer, not cancer itself.<br />This was unbelievably refreshing!<br />Green does a frighteningly good job of writing from the perspective of a teenage girl. I could relate to Hazel on many levels, cough ANTM watching. I had no problem with Hazel and Augustus' sudden attraction. That's how hormones work.<br /> I loved that Green didn't feel any need to dumb down his characters. They speak like intellectual teens, they do exist.<br />The one wishy-washy element of this book was Van Houten. I understand his importance, and loved him as a character, but once he started showing up unannounced in Hazel's car he lost his credibility.<br />All my problems with this book are minor though, wiped away by how astoundingly beautiful the rest of the book is.<br />A must read!

B005LAIHE0|4.0|\\"This is supposed to be exciting. It's your wedding you only get a few of these.\\" One year after they first met Tom (Segel) proposes to Violet (Blunt) and the excitement of planning a wedding begins. Soon after the excitement starts to wind down other problems starts to come up. When Violet gets her dream job they decide to put the plans on hold and move across country. Months turn to years and little by little the stresses start to affect the couple. I am a pretty big Jason Segel fan and I was looking forward to this movie. While this is very very funny with some great quotable lines there is also a lot of heart in this which makes it a great movie to watch. The drama scenes fit in perfectly and they do not slow down the movie or make you forget it's a comedy which is the problem with most comedies like this. There are a few classic scenes in this (the Cookie Monster vs. Elmo argument is my favorite) and this is one that you can watch more then once and still laugh at every time. I may be hyping this up to much for you know but this is the type of movie that couples can watch together and both enjoy for different reasons. I highly recommend this. I give it an A.
1451608659|5.0|i love this book. such a great read. i remember watching dominique when i was a small girl so when i herd she had a book out about her life i bought it. i usually don't buy memoir books i find them for the most part pretty boring. but this one draws you in right from the start.
1439102430|5.0|Kathy Reichs is a fine writer.  Although her last book, which centered on NASCAR, bored me, this one is just plain terrific.  As usual, the book is full of fascinating information about forensic anthropology, and, in this case, diamond mining (now I know why diamonds are so expensive), and aboriginals in Canada.  The book is tightly plotted, and extremely well-written.  The initial crimes are heart-breaking and anger-causing and thanks to Reichs's finely-drawn heroine, Temperance Brennan, I felt what she felt.  I read until 3 a.m.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|i love this movie it's so neat to see how babies from around the world are taken care of. some mite make you think how in the world do they make it through those baby yrs. i actually bought this movie for my son. we used to watch it on netflix but they stopped playing it on there so we just had to by it. he LOVES this movie so very much he is 2 now and for the past year it has been his favorite.

B008XCF7Y6|5.0|Well done and entertaining.  Much better movie than either the second or third Starship Trooper movie.  Watch it all the way through the ending credits.
0345803507|1.0|I think this book and its two predecessors are popular because they preserve the popular notion that kinky people are somehow messed up (Christian) or evil (the dominatrix who Christian used to be with turns into one of the villains), while letting the so-called \\"normal\\" heroine enjoy a bunch of kinky sex. For heaven's sake, just say, okay, she likes kinky sex. Maybe the fact that fifty gajillion shades of readers have devoured this book means enjoying a bit of pervy sex IS normal, and not messed up or evil.<br /><br />Anastasia remains self-righteous and irritating and immature. He's possessive and humorless and condescending. In her determination not to consent to anything that hurts except when she enjoys it, she has wrought a grand, healing change in him, showing him the importance of...something...I can't remember what. It was pretty boring. And she doesn't spend her time wondering whether he wishes he could do with her the things he used to really enjoy doing and, indeed, WAS doing, with women who accepted his desires. Pshaw! He's been transformed by love. THAT's what that something was! Love! The kind of love that tells you you're a seriously messed up individual who really needs to change the way you think and act to deserve love, even though you've never hurt anyone who didn't consent to it before. But you didn't know what you were doing was wrong. You were just messed up in the head. Poor Fifty! He's not a reformed rake; he's a reformed dominant! Rest assured, dear reader. He's happy. No. He's overjoyed. He's on cloud nine. Also, he's rich. And dominant. Just not scary, weird dominant. Anymore.<br /><br />(Did I mention he's rich? Well, he's rich. Which means...ohmigosh! SHE becomes totally RICH! Like wearing expensive bikinis and all. And lolling half-naked on the beach with her top off. Which makes him mad, because what if someone else saw her and took her picture? Cuz she TOTALLY is not kinky like wanting people to see her naked. THAT would be weird.  But he's mad even though it was kinda an accident. But you know, when you're rich and gorgeous and on your kinky honeymoon, you get all tired and stuff, and just fall asleep on the beach without your top on and roll over. But that means you have to be punished. And you may end up with hickeys on your breasts from your punishment. Which felt good while it was happening but, like, is really childish and all for him to do. So you'll have to be all mad at him and have to teach him a lesson. And your inner goddess is totally going to sigh and roll her eyes at that one. Life is soooo hard when you have to be, like, the Anti-Perv!)<br /><br />Sorry. Where was I?<br /><br />There are no doubt other books that take for granted that kink is rather normal, and allow kinky characters with some depth and decency to fall in love with each other while having the aforementioned kinky sex without any shame or hint thereof. If you are considering reading this book because you think you might like reading about kinky sex between grown up people who respect each other and respect diverse sexual desires, I'd suggest you go find those other books instead. If you think you would like to read about kinky sex in a book that suggests that kinky sex is wrong...except when two good-looking rich people who are obsessed with each other--sorry, who really really really like TOTALLY love each other more than anything--have slightly kinky sex on yachts, or in expensive hotels, while being chased by bad people, which makes them stressed out to the point that they can hardly remember to look at each others' lips in a longing fashion every time one of them licks their lips, but they manage to remember and it's sooooo sexy, even the thirtieth time or so, and reading about it will really make your inner goddess do the samba in a hula dress, then hey, this book is for you. Enjoy!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my sister in-law and I have to say I loved it.  Mr Zusak most certainly has a way with words.  He gives great thought to how he describes even the most simplest of things.  What other writers would overlook as perhaps insignificant 'fillers' to a story, he somehow brings to life and you can see what he sees.  I've never come across an author with the power to ignite words the way he seems to do so effortlessly.<br />Nazi Germany is never an easy topic to tackle, especially from a German perspective but I thought Mr Zusak did tremendously well. The scenes of the Jews walking down Munich Street were very difficult to read, but Mr Zusak captured it perfectly, that you felt like you were there watching it all unfold.  Even when Death supposedly ruined the ending by speaking of it several chapters before, I was still left surprised and a little shell shocked when it did happen.<br />Great story by a great author.  Well Done Sir.
1594203059|1.0|Re: Civilization: What is missing?<br /><br />Two game changers are not discussed and it is a major weakness of this book.<br />  - Climate change is hardly mentioned and its impact will start being felt much sooner than thought.<br /> In The Economist, Sept.1, 2012 issue, page 43, we can read « The Arctic is melting faster than anybody thought... »<br />Climate change is rushing on the planet, the tipping point may be past, and it will have a huge impact on civilizations. In his book « Guns, Germs and Steel », Jared Diamond shows what climate does to civilizations.<br /> What we must all understand is that the combination of bad governance, corruption and climate change will be deadly. Where do we find the worst governance? In the BRICS. To concentrate on ASIA, governance and corruption in CHINA, INDIA and many other countries, including JAPAN, will make it impossible for these countries to fight climate change. Asia has always been prone to bad climate. Now we are talking of much worse, complete destruction of coastal cities, etc...<br /> The second game changer is the impact of shale oil and gas.<br />In the next few years, when America is self sufficient, it will have devastating consequences for the Middle East. The wealth of Arab countries will vanish and these countries will be unable to face the Arab « spring »... and climate change.<br />  In other words, because of climate change and shale oil and gas, the West will comparatively pull ahead. Most Westen countries have good enough governance to resist climate change.<br />  This being said, N. Fergusson shows off his knowledge of history. Good, but it is Anglo-American self centered. It ignores the contribution of continental Europe. But is is another book...<br /><br />J.P. Delorme

030758836X|4.0|In her novel, \\"Gone, Girl,\\" Gillian Flynn presents a cunning little game of \\"he said, she said\\" that depicts more than the obviously dysfunctional marriage of Nick and Amy Dunne.  By exploring ideas of persona versus personality that elevate the concept of dependency and manipulation to a psychotic level, Flynn crafts a novel almost worthy of Patricia Highsmith's amoral and asexual Tom Ripley series ( [[ASIN:0393332144 The Talented Mr. Ripley]]).<br /><br />I say \\"almost\\" because some of the events that take place and their reception by interested parties, at times, defy credibility.  Perhaps Flynn remains uber-clever, spinning a media crazed zeitgeist of the early 21st century where an absolute truth no longer matters.  The sway of public opinion ultimately rules with the swift power of a \\"thumbs up or down\\" of the less refined times of the gladiatorial arena, making the invention of a variety of game faces paramount to ultimate survival. Traditional commonsense loses its grasp; the grounding effect of aligning with conventional establishments fails, faltering in the face of machinations of minds that create whatever universes suit their purposes.  Flynn's Amy and Nick are definitely in the New Age \\"Now\\" and take it to a whole other unspiritual level.<br /><br />Without giving away too much, the novel allows the partnership of Amy and Nick equal time as each of them explains their standpoint regarding the state of their marriage on their fifth anniversary--an anniversary again heralded by Amy's traditional \\"treasure hunt\\" where a series of clues planted along the lines of \\"The Amazing Race\\" will lead Nick to the goal: a carefully selected and Amy-appropriate gifting.  However, instead of detailing for the reader the expected cutesy affirmations of a young couple weaving a life together, Flynn sets a more macabre scene, depicting a cyber-circumstance where a perhaps contrived struggle has taken place, the disappearance of Amy becomes blatant fact and gradually all fingers point to Nick as her would-be murderer.  Using an alternative chapter change of voice, Flynn grants both Nick and Amy individual center stages where the reader can judge the credibility of their statements while evolving a portrait of them and their marriage that will differ greatly from the one they promote.<br /><br />On a broader plane, Nick and Amy represent well-educated couples so inundated by what they are supposed to be: perfect, successful, financially sound, intelligent, pragmatic and innovative--that they have no other choice but to unravel in the face of the squashed economy and downsizing realities of the circa 2012 American world.  Amy's parents, two psychologists who fashioned a children's series of books called \\"Amazing Amy,\\" starring a more perfect version of their daughter raise the bar for overachievement and stress the young couple's finely-fraught bond when they ask for money to help them overcome bad financial decisions.  Flynn comments quite eloquently using the voices of both her characters on the quagmire of high expectations, entitlement and the failure of smaller goals to manufacture a larger sense of success and purpose.<br /><br />This social commentary skims the surface of dysfunction.  Whose expectations are more unrealistic?  Amy's or Nick's?  Whose voice is more valid?  Whose is more likeable?  Are entitled people likeable? Can only those with such mutually lofty overblown expectations truly like each other?  Is that sense of being \\"on the same page\\" what makes a marriage or any other relationship truly work?  When one's game face is stripped off and your partner actually \\"sees\\" the real you, is this honesty, this `wysiwyg' supposed \\"good-thing\\" what you really expect? Flynn's well-thought-out prose poses these questions amidst the stream of her mystery of whatever happened to Amy; she writes an exemplary and cautionary tale of what today's society reaps in terms of morality, ethics and the lack thereof.  And then she twists it like a Moebius strip and their reality is reinvented and surprisingly validated.  Intriguing.<br /><br />Bottom line?  In \\"Gone, Girl,\\" Gillian Flynn writes a fictional account in the vein of true crime from the perspectives of an extremely unlikeable five-year married husband and wife attempting to attain success and wellbeing in the turbulence of a poor economy and the wasteland of pumped-up expectations.  The alternating viewpoints of husband Nick and wife Amy keep the reader titillated and wondering what will happen next until the very last page where in moments almost worthy of Patricia Highsmith, Flynn defines characters stripped of false optimism and whittled down to bare knuckled stratagems that will yield them their most willful desires.  Recommended even when some of the response to the twists and turns seem a bit ludicrous yet still reflect the machinations of either the character or persona portrayed.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"t like a Moebius strip and their reality is reinvented and surprisingly validated.

0399159029|5.0|Bernie Gunther, Berlin's Kriminal Commissar, was newly returned in the summer of 1941 to his hometown  after a spell in Byelorussia with the SD, the intelligence arm of the Nazi SS.  While in Byelorussia he had witnessed firsthand the cruel brutality of the SS in torturing and murdering thousands of innocent civilians, particularly Jews, and much as he loved his fatherland, he hated what the Nazi party and its leaders had done to it and to him.  The German army had already over-run Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, Belgium, Denmark and The Netherlands, and flushed with that success, had already embarked on Operation \\"Barbarossa\\" Hitler's long-held dream to conquer Russia.  The war in the East however, was having serious consequences for the Berliners, with decaying infrastructure, due to the absence of young men to take care of things, and serious shortages of foodstuffs and supplies, including the German basics such as beer, coffee and cigarettes.  Street crime in Berlin had taken on new dimensions for the \\"Kripo\\", the Kriminal Polizei to which Gunther belonged.  Late one night in September, Gunther was called to investigate a death on the railroad line where a body had been found, the apparent victim of a train accident.  Gunther's trained eye told him that this was no simple train accident.  His investigation resulted in his meeting the lovely Arianne Tauber.  When the newly appointed Reichsprotector of Occupied Czechoslovakia, General Reinhard Heydrich,  ordered Gunther to join him in Prague to investigate death threats against him, Gunther took Arianne along for the ride.  The assignment in Prague quickly evolved in a different direction.  While Heydrich was hosting a meeting of high-ranking party elite at his Czech mansion, one of his officers was murdered in his room in the mansion.  Considering the tight security in place, it was evident that the murder had been committed by someone inside the house.  Heydrich told Gunther that everyone attending the meeting,including several high ranking Nazi Generals, was to be considered a suspect, and ordered him to be ruthless in interviewing all of them to find the killer.  Gunther was eventually to discover the ulterior motive behind Heydrich's order.  Author Philip Kerr has taken the dark history of the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and with a little help from Agatha Christie, woven in the tale of his fictional character Bernhard \\"Bernie\\" Gunther, the tough talking detective.  It is a tale brilliantly told, a book which is really hard to put down.  A work of historical fiction which also tells the true story of the sadistic cruelty of Reinhard Heydrich, the man Hitler called The Man with the Iron Heart, and his henchmen of the SS as they brought the terror of the Nazi holocaust to Czechoslovakia in 1942.  Once again Kerr has written an outstanding work of historical fiction.

1401937519|5.0|I first saw Anita Moorjani on Wayne Dyer's PBS special, where she was a featured guest. After hearing her talk about her near-death experience (from \\"terminal\\" cancer), her spiritual epiphanies during the time she was out of body, and her miraculous full recovery afterward, I immediately ordered her book. Dying to Be Me is every bit as compelling as Anita's in-person descriptions. I was fascinated and inspired by the details of her time beyond the physical realm as well as by the expansive wisdom she tapped into while there. What she writes about reminds me very much of the teachings of spiritual master/avatar Panache Desai--oneness, being your unique self, unconditional love, etc. Both of them are consciously connected to a divine presence that lives within us all. The time has come for each of us to open to that connection and live our lives full out as the person we came here to be. Anita's book is a gateway; her words spark the opening. What a gift she has given us!<br />Peggy Kornegger<br />author of Living with Spirit, Journey of a Flower Child
1402270275|3.0|Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy.<br /><br />KISS OF STEEL reimagines our world with an aristocratic vampire class as the lynchpin that changes everything familiar. People pay their taxes in blood, medicine strives to discover more about this all important virus, and weaponry scales up to combat a different class of powerful superhumans. Though there are certainly flavors of steampunk in the alternate history, KISS OF STEEL feels much more like a well written paranormal romance to me.<br /><br />But while advanced gadgets doesn't get much pagetime, McMaster does explore the medical developments of the time. Calling the ruling class \\"vampires\\" is an oversimplification, and is actually incorrect by the mechanics of this world. I loved the intricacies of blue bloods and vampires, the infected and the changed, all the different permutations of a virus that society doesn't entirely understand. And despite the fact that Honoria and Blade are drawn together by a classic, paranormal romance \\"inexplicable physical attraction\\", McMaster provided growth and emotional connection to support turning that sexual chemistry into something more lasting. There were a few instances where the plot stumbled, mostly concerning the supporting character Barrons, his relationship with Honoria's father, and his enmity for Vickers. Those missteps bumped the series from \\"pre-order\\" to \\"wait and see\\", if only because Barrons's murky motivations made me less interested in him as a future hero.<br /><br />Even with Barrons low on my list, there are still plenty of intriguing characters I'm hoping to see again. If the sexually conflicted Will, the duchess of Casavian, or the human queen held captive by her vampire consort are in staring roles, London Steampunk #2 will go to the top of my To Be Read list. Those characters may also be living in a changed landscape, as the culmination of KISS OF STEEL seems like it would send ripples throughout the blue blood world. A fun romance with interesting world building, I'm looking forward to seeing where London Steampunk goes next.<br /><br />Sexual Content: Several sex scenes.esting world building, I'm looking forward to seeing where London Steampunk goes next.<br /><br />Sexual Content: Several sex scenes.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Mills and Boon on steroids.  Except the M & B heroines have self respect and the writer's vocabulary is usually quite good.<br />You just kept reading this book asking yourself 'why'?  Why am I reading it, why is she doing this? why did the writer bother?  It's voyeurism I suppose.  I read it wanting to know what next...what ridiculous thing is this girl going to do next.  Apart from being very one dimensional, the characters only ever have sex.  That's what you read it for, to see what all the fuss was about.  Unfortunately it is one of those BAD bits of media that gained impetus because it was a surprise, not because it was good.  Like Michael Jackson dangling kids of the edge of balconies.  you're kind of shocked by it, but you'd never do it or enjoy it.<br />Don't waste your money on this book.  I wish I'd bought a bag of freddo frogs instead.  Or a Mills and Boon. (;

B003UESJFG|5.0|This is a hard to find movie in the rental section. After several months of people recommending this movie to me and me not being able to rent it, I decided to just buy it. I was not disappointed with this movie at all, and loved every minute. Written (apparently with adults in mind) this movie turns the mirror on classic super hero movies, much in the same way Shrek did with fairy tale movies. Ferrell, Pitt, Fey, Cross and Hill provide good voice acting, but the writing and CGI are the real winners that make it touching and beautiful to watch.
B004EPYZQ2|2.0|I went into this movie thinking it was going to be similar to an E.T/Stand by Me type of 80s nostalgia film from the comments I've seen from others. After watching this movie I can say for sure that it is nowhere near the quality of those films. This movie is just so lackluster with the cliche, underdeveloped characters and the underwhelming big secret that is revealed that left me saying.. is this it? I'm glad i only paid $7.99 for this on blu ray because I'll never watch it again. I think I'll throw it off a bridge and film that, I'll probably get more entertainment out of it.

B009329ZF2|1.0|I must say in advance I should have paid more attention to the reviews. I also did not finish the movie, I couldn't, even tried to get hammered to finish it. Even buzzed this movie sucks, the male lead is an idiot, who in the begining breaks into a store to get a girl at the bar a chicken burrito. Gets her the burrito while running from the cops and hands it to her as he is getting tasered by the cops. Love at first sight, I thought that he was just going to be the comical relief but no he is the main character. The brother forces him at this point to join the navy, which I can tell you coming from a military service that he would never be accepted, mainly because of just being arrested. Then next we see him as a officer still making stupid mistakes and dating the admirals daughter, who he gave that chicken burrito too. Also now the retarded toilet paper that they are passing of as the storyline would have us believe that this moron is some kind of flawed military genius. At this point even knowing that the special effects were going to be awesome I could not watch anymore. I knew what I was in for the flawed hero goes on a journey saving the world while trying to be more like his brother who is the responsible type who was most likely going to die in the first alien attack. Then he realizes his own potential and becomes the great hero that leads the humans to victory over the aliens. DO NOT RENT AND PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I purchased this novel because of the numerous positive reviews it had received. Unfortunately I was disappointed. While the story is good and has merit, I was not overwhelmed.<br /><br />What bothered me most were the plot holes. I was presented with a society living in silos that penetrate the ground for 130 stories or more. This society is realistically modern. They have electricity, computers, hydroponic farms, radio and electronic communication, and yet, no one has ever thought, proposed, or built a damn elevator or lift. Everything is moved by porters and workers lugging things up and down countless floors. It was illogical and it detracted from the story-frankly it bothered me to no end.<br /><br />Now before you go off and say: \\"Well you missed the point. The author was showing how limited and controlled this society was. He expounded on this hypothesis when explaining why paper notes and written messages were cheaper and used as the main means for communication by individuals as opposed to electronic means.\\"<br /><br />I got that. However, that logic is skewed at best-ask Homeland Security. It is far easier to intercept, track, decipher and monitor electronic communications between people and groups as opposed to hand written messages being passed from one person to another-and that goes for elevators too. If \\"IT\\" had had control of the elevators they would have had a much better control of the society. They could have regulated their society's movement to a much finer degree etc., etc..<br /><br />Lastly, the ending: Now as a writer myself, I understand the coolness of a surprise ending. It's a great tool when used correctly. For me, it didn't work here. I spent too much time reading this very thick book and investing myself in the characters and their stories, and I felt cheated. After putting up with the shenanigans and deceit of \\"IT\\" and Bernard (who reminded me of Warden Samuel Norton in the Shawshank Redemption) I wanted to see him sweat. I wanted him \\"to feel\\" the coming burn of a cleaning-that would have been poetic justice.<br /><br />Other than that the story is solid and the characters believable-it's worth a read.\\"to feel\\" the coming burn of a cleaning-that would have been poetic justice.<br /><br />Other than that the story is solid and the characters believable-it's worth a read.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I hope people will take the time to watch the 90-minute documentary \\"Wreckage and Rage- Making Alien3\\". First of all, anyone remotely interested in the art and politics of filmmaking owe it to themselves to see this incredibly revealing documentary that chronicles the making of the third film in the franchise and director David Fincher's trial-by-fire as he made his first studio film. Like many people, I've never warmed to the film (even the 1992 cut; a signficant restoration of Fincher's original vision of the story), but watching this documentary and seeing how *other* people, non-creative people, the \\"bean counters\\", can essentially take what is art and reduce to a product, a franchise, and all the other sterile terms that sucks the magic from movie-making and makes it the crass business that it is (the other great story is how Joseph L. Mankiewicz almost created a classic, perhaps a masterpiece, in \\"Cleopatra\\" only to see it eviscerated by studio suits and libidinous stars, but that's a tale for another day). And although I'm one of those people who doesn't usually want to know how the magic on the screen was created (I want to *believe*), the documentary does a wonderful job examining how the film was constructed, especially the set design and special effects creation. I finally understand why there are dozens of names in the credits rolling up the screen as the movie ends!<br /><br />Perhaps Alien3 is an object lesson: perhaps any franchise does have an expiration date. Both \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" were genre defining films (that even Ridley Scott could not better in the underwhelming \\"Prometheus\\"). That said, this documentary clearly demonstrates that a young, hungry director had a vision to take a hackneyed film genre and take it in a new, more human direction, and elevate both the human and non-human characters to a different plane of reference. In many ways, Fincher's \\"Se7en\\" is the Alien3 story brought to earth and the monster contained in a human form while the characters around it are still as empty and lost as the convicts in Fincher's grim prison world. I urge you to watch this documentary, and the watch the 1992 cut of the film. **Highly Recommended**the characters around it are still as empty and lost as the convicts in Fincher's grim prison world.

Although the success principles are usually the same in most books, I do enjoy reading the stories of how the authors and other people have used those principles to achieve things.  If you're new to personal development, this book might be a lot more valuable to you than it was to me.

B00785P2QC|4.0|this can be a fun game. but watch ot if you go to get more invest points or more money it will come out of your bank account. but if you wait then you get extra invest points as you play the game. just don't use up all your invest points on small things and you can have a lot. also you get invest points everyday and everytime you level up.  its not a bad game but it can be fun.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|best book ever, a must read from book one to book three starts slow but gets better. Loved every bit
B0036T31YY|5.0|This movie does not follow the typical horror flick plot. You have to get through a quarter of it before you start to figure out the plot. This is more of a psychological horror film than a typical paranormal scary film. Love it. It's a mix of memento and ghost ship just to give you a taste of what this is about without spoiling anything.

B004MC8CA2|2.0|This Bible app used to work perfectly fine for me, but I would recommend using a &quot;real&quot; Bible because last I checked, paper doesn't have glitches or requires a wifi connection.<br />True, it boasts more translations of the Bible than I thought there even were, and it has an easy method of quickly moving to which verses you need to get to, but it has its problems.<br /><br />For one, you need a YouVersion account just to download any of the translations. This isn't really a big deal, just a little inconvenience, so if you choose not to sign up it requires a wifi connection. Also, as I read I noticed random letters and numbers jumbled incoherently in the text, like typos. Finally, it became unusable, as when I look up a verse, completely random and unrelated verses are listed instead.

0345525558|5.0|I read this book in one sitting, I was enthralled by plot, and how Victoria uses the flowers to communicate, and was heartbroken by the child's experiences in foster care.  This is a wonderful book about forgiveness, about love and understanding.  Victoria is not a circle trying to fit into a square peg, she is a triangle trying to fit into a world that is setup like a grid.  This is an amazing story.
B00846WWVM|1.0|i got this game for my daughter to play on her tablet.  She had seen it and said it looked like a lot of fun and had to have it.  Well after 15 minutes of playing with it she was done and never went back.  I tried it and thought about the same.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After the second chapter, I was hooked.  Totally mesmerized by this emotionally scarred beautiful man, Christian Grey,  I found it most difficult to put my e-reader down. I looked forward to each reading time as if it were a personal  life requirement. The author, E.L. James, with her extraordinary use of language, made one feel present, involved and hopeful for Anastasia, Christian and all involved. You became part the pain, the joy and the why of each erotic  maneuver and emotional decision.<br /><br />As E.L. James ended book one with....\\"I surrendered to my grief\\"...I had to read the second offering of the trilogy.<br /><br />This book and the entire trilogy were purchased at Amazon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was amazing. Couldn't put it down. Was sad to see the books end. Deft a fan and would read more of the authors books
B00280LYIC|5.0|Wow! The second I saw this because book at the Book Fair I knew instantly that I had to buy it. My friends all recommended it to me, and I bought it. It was great...very Harry Potter-ish. Alot of reviewers say that as a bad thing, but what's so bad about getting inspiration, right? And besides, that's not how Rick Riordan came up with the book idea, just to make that clear. The book is very delightful, bringing back mythology into this dull world. It helps everyone find their inner hero. I would (in my opinion) rate it ten and up.<br />:)
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game literally ate up two whole days of my life. There's 80 levels at the time of writing, and some of them are fiendishly hard, but most are pretty easy. The game keeps the same feel as the show, with entertaining voice clips between levels.
0156907399|5.0|As is so often true, I found that this novel was very autobiographical.  The Woolf family spent every summer at the same rented house in Cornwall, looking out on Porthminster Bay.  Woolf wrote in her diary that these stays at the summer house were some of the happiest times in her life and the novel was written to commemorate that.  Like in the novel, there actually was a trip out to a lighthouse that Virginia's youngest brother was not permitted to go on, much to his dismay.<br /><br />The novel is not only a portrait of Woolf's mother, but also her father.  Woolf's mother was a great beauty who actually was a model for the artists of her day.  Like in the novel, she was loving, caring, authentic and direct, but she was spread too thin.  Everyone in the family wanted more from her.  Through two marriages, she had given birth to seven children, with Virginia being the youngest girl.  Her second husband and Virginia's father, Stephen, was a very self involved and needy person.  In her diaries, Virginia describes him as needing constantly to be soothed and attended to.  If he did not receive the solace he believed he deserved, he would fly into a violent rage.  In addition to these duties, Virginia's mother was something of a nurse and was often asked to care for dying family members in their final days.  She did this quite well, but her frequent absences enraged her husband.<br /><br />Virginia's mother died when Virginia was thirteen.  I think the cause of death was something like scarlet fever, but exhaustion was also listed.  Her death marked a turning point in the life of Virginia.  Virginia's half sister then attempted to step into her mother's shoes and try to run the household and also soothe the easily disrupted ego of the father.  This proved to be quite a taxing task and sadly, this half sister then died two years later.<br /><br />When Virgina was 17, her father then appointed one of Virginia's half brothers, George, to escort her to parties and present her to society. It is so tragic to read that this half brother then began to sexually abuse Virginia.  He was 30 years old and in a position of guardian for her.  It is believed by scholars that George was also abusing Virginia's sister Vanessa.  In her diaries, Virginia attributes her mental breakdowns to the sexual abuse she suffered.  Two years later Virginia's father dies. Virginia, her sister and the two youngest brothers take this opportunity to sever contacts with the abusive half brother.<br /><br />In one of her diaries, Woolf wrote that from the ages of 13-44 she had been obsessed by thoughts of both of her parents.  Woolf describes it as an unhealthy, debilitating obsession.  In writing To The Lighthouse, Woolf wrote that she was able to give voice to some long held and deeply felt emotions about her parents.  She said that by writing about it, she was thereby able to release these things and get on with her life.  She said she had always before that point been a skeptic of psychoanalytic treatment, but after this experience, she saw the value in it.  Vanessa Bell, Virginia's sister wrote that reading the novel was like seeing her mother \\"raised from the dead\\".<br /><br />It is now believed by scholars that Woolf suffered from bipolar disorder.  In conceiving To The Lighthouse, Woolf said she went for a walk in Tavistock Square and the whole novel came to her in a big rush, and she instantly had all the images and feelings of it.  During the writing, Woolf would be in the manic phase of the disorder, but she could feel the imaginative effort of it pushing her equilibrium to the breaking point. Once she finished a first draft of a novel, the depression would then descend upon her.  The creative process and pursuing her art took a huge toll on the life of Virginia Woolf, but we are fortunate to have her many masterpieces of literature.r to society.

0307730697|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure about reading a story that is more about someone's life before the military than during...but as I read and learned about Adam Brown and his extremely unique personality and faith I was inspired. I can't honestly complain about anything now that I know what Adam went through and how he rose to the top while staying so positive and faithful during trying times. Some of the wording and dialog don't flow really well but that's a minor issue that some other reviews make more of an issue than its worth. Read this book....even if you have no faith.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|I was told that 'Fifty Shades of Grey' had taken England by storm but that it was badly written and pornographic.  It isn't!  It's light and easy reading, hardly epic literature, but the storyline and characterizations are strong enough to carry you through all three books in the series, all the way to it's cinderella ending.  Pornographic?  Well, it's certainly explicit but it's not dirty. I'm glad I read the series and would certainly recommend it to any hot blooded, normal, curious reader.

B005LAIGF0|2.0|While well acted by Paquin, this film was grossly overwrought and narcissistic journey in self-importance by the director, a one Kenneth Lonnergan. Definitely a New York art house film. It's the type of picture that leaves the critics (and wanna be critics) cheering and everyone one else leaving the theatre saying \\"WTF?\\"<br /><br />The other reviews will tell you the plot, so I won't waste your time with that repetitive nonsense. What I will tell you is that this film was in desperate need of an editor. It was Shakespeare that once said (as Polonius in Hamlet) that \\"brevity is the soul of wit\\". If that is the case, this is truly a very dim-wited picture. At 2 1/2 hours long, this could have been neatly trimmed to to an hour and 45 and been a much better product. Instead we are left with endless minutes of panoramic views of the New York skyline and of people walking down the street. For what!? The movie takes place in New York, I get that, next scene please. What makes matters even worse is that the film was actually over 3 hours long but Fox had to fight for 5 years to edit it down to 150 minutes. And no, Michael Cimino had nothing to do with its production.<br /><br />To give to some cred, Ana Paquin did a superb job playing a spoiled, emotionally immature, narcissistic and frankly cruel teenager. Hard to believe she was 23 or so at the time of filming. And while the supporting cast did a fine job in displaying mostly dislikable people, their efforts were wasted in this muddy production. And this is AFTER, Fox Searchlight called in Martin Scorsese and others to edit down to 150 min during its 5 year legal limbo. Oy vey!
1402270275|4.0|Honoria and her siblings have gone into hiding in Whitechapel. In hopes of staying out of reach of Vickers.  This act lands her straight into the path of the vampire Blade. No one crosses him and his protection comes with a price. Honoria is not sure she's willing to pay the price.<br /><br />Steampunk and I are not the best of friends. There have been a few stories I've enjoyed, but for some reason I've had a hard getting into the genre. But with Kiss of Steel the story clicked with me. I loved the mixture of the steampunk and paranormal elements.  I enjoyed the setting and was absolutely charmed by the hero and his \\"accent\\".  I liked McMaster's take on vampires. Kiss of Steel is a wonderfully paced world that is delectable and dangerous. Fans of both genres will enjoy this one.

1468179993|5.0|The Speaker Bucket<br /><br />If I were writing Mastering the Management Buckets today, I would add another core competency, The Speaker Bucket (No. 21).<br /><br />In one of my Top-10 books for 2008, I quoted Bert Decker, author of [[ASIN:0312374690 You've Got to Be Believed to Be Heard, Updated Edition: The Complete Book of Speaking . . . in Business and in Life!]]: \\"Your ability to communicate is the single most important skill determining your success in every aspect of your life.  You dare not make the mistake of thinking that communication is nothing but dumping information on another person.\\"<br /><br />As co-dependents to bad speakers, somehow we allow mind-numbing keynote addresses, board and committee presentations, staff reports, and--oh my!--sermons, to turn our minds to mush--as we patiently wait for that magical phrase, \\"And in conclusion...\\"<br /><br />The solution? At your next staff meeting, coach your wanna-be-presenters with books from your \\"Speaker Bucket\\" bookshelf.  Here's another good one:<br /><br />How to Deliver a TED Talk: Secrets of the World's Most Inspiring Presentations, by Jeremey Donovan.<br /><br />The author researched hundreds of online videos of the most popular 18-minute talks presented at the highly acclaimed TED Conferences. In just 107 big-print, fast-reading pages, he boils it all down. But it's not a speaking-tips-for-dummies blah/blah/blah book, it's much, much better--and rich in detail where it matters.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with TED Conferences (\\"Riveting Talks by Remarkable People\\"), check it out. TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is often described as \\"the ultimate brain spa.\\"<br /><br />Donovan's prepare-a-talk toolkit has two sections: \\"Content, Story & Structure\\" and \\"Delivery & Design.\\" The detailed chapters range from \\"How to Craft Your Catchphrase\\" to \\"How to Conclude Your Talk.\\" (Pastors: please read this...please!!)<br /><br />Golfers are constantly challenged to master a zillion golf swing details--all at the same time (head down!). Ditto speaking tips (head up!). Yet Donovan gently brings the reader/would-be speaker along the journey, one practical step at a time:<br /><br />  --Humor: \\"The fundamental principle to remember is that humor is rooted in surprise.\\"<br />  --Stories: \\"If you would like to bore people to tears until they tear out their hair and claw their eyes out, then hammer them with facts for the entire 18 minutes of your TEDTalk.\\"<br />  --PowerPoints: \\"...four of the ten most viewed TED presenters used no slides in their talks.\\" Yet if you must, the author recommends the 7x7 rule, limiting each slide to no more than seven bullets and no more than seven words per bullet. He quotes speaking coach Craig Valentine, \\"Use slides as a place where you take off and land. Nothing more.\\"<br /><br />The author dissects Malcolm Gladwell's popular TEDTalk, \\"Choice, Happiness and Spaghetti\\" (more than 2 million views).  In the video, Gladwell invests all 18 minutes in telling a story about Dr. Howard Moskowitz, market researcher and psychophysicist, and his unusual spaghetti sauce crusade with the food industry.<br /><br />Donovan's lesson? \\"Malcolm Gladwell's second clever choice was to make Howard Moskowitz the hero. As a speaker, one of the worst things you can do is put yourself on a pedestal. Position yourself as an equal, perhaps a guide, but not superior to your listeners.\\"<br /><br />About 74 percent of all people suffer from the fear of public speaking (known as Glossophobia).  This book could help your boss, your direct reports, your board members, your volunteers--and dozens of others. And as we say often, \\"Delegate Your Reading\\" to someone on your team--and then add this helpful toolbox to your resource shelf--and mentor your people with niche books and niche chapters.<br /><br />By the way, adds Donovan in Chapter 7: How to Conclude Your Talk, \\"When you provide a clear signal that you are moving to the end of your speech, people will increase their level of attention.\\" (Hang on, this review will terminate shortly.)<br /><br />So this is the third book I've added to my ad hoc \\"Speaker Bucket\\" shelf.

B009329ZF2|5.0|Update: 7/19/2013 - Battleship is now playing on the HBO channels, so I watched it again to see where I left the track on this review. This movie has been maligned by professional critics and everyday people who review, and I watched carefully for that AHA, they were right, moment. I LOVED it all over again! Two hours of rollicking good sci fi fun that I unashamedly enjoyed as much this time as the first time. I guess I will never understand when people stopped laughing and enjoying a simple, old fashioned good guys vs. bad guys movie (I reference The Last Stand with Arnold Schwarzenegger) and simply enjoyed it for what it was - fun with no apparent relevance. I stand by this review and ask anyone who reads this to let go and stop looking for trouble where there is none!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I live in Maine. I have watched dozens of movies supposedly taking place in New England. I've had to suspend my better judgement as I recognize over and over, Vancouver, CA, Oregon or Washington being passed off as New England. If you ARE from New England, you know darn well the movie or show you are watching does NOT take place in New England. This is a bit of information for those of you who are either in the military (and, mind you, we are retired military and strongly support you), or are die-hard sci-fi geeks who have whined on and on about how \\"unreal\\" this movie is. For crying out loud. Can you NOT suspend your beliefs for 90 minutes and just enjoy a good old fashioned shoot 'em up, yay for us as we take on and win against all odds a bunch of obviously better equipped aliens?<br /><br />I LOVED this movie. It was fun. It gave you time to get to know and like the characters. I'm not stupid - I certainly saw many of the errors and problems pointed out by those of you who are so depressed by today's miserable issues or whatever that you cannot just sit back, buy some popcorn and a soda and enjoy this movie for what it is? Just a fun movie for families and people of all ages, full of excitement, good guys vs. bad guys, very funny moments, and some hot guys for us ladies to drool over in the process. OF COURSE, I had to suspend belief that Alex Harper would have even made it into the military with his background (not!), that a bunch of ships out for an international exercise would be armed to the teeth (not!), that there was no way in heck the few ships caught in the dome with some really vicious aliens had a snowball's chance in heck of winning (not!).<br /><br />But you know what? I wasn't WATCHING this movie for realism. I wasn't watching this movie for some deep political statement. I wasn't watching this movie for a message that war is bad and peace is good. I watched it to escape reality and have a lot of fun. Something I haven't done at the movies for a very long time. The language wasn't terrible, the acting (yummy Taylor Kitsch!!) was great, the movie was well cast, a little romance thrown in. I laughed, I found myself at the end of the movie after what seemed like 5 minutes (what we call a 5-minute show - it's so good you lose all track of time and it seems like it's over in 5 minutes as opposed to most shows and movies today that have me looking at the clock and thinking \\"oh my gosh, only 15 minutes has gone by???\\") wishing I could watch it for the first time all over again.<br /><br />Seriously, people need to lighten up and just have some fun. Especially today. The world isn't such a great place right now and I am smart enough to know too much about just how bad things are.<br /><br />I almost passed this movie up because it only had three stars! If I were deciding whether or not to watch this movie based on most reviews, I definitely would have passed it up. I AM HERE TO ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND TO SUSPEND YOUR LIFE AND REALITY FOR THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IT! DO NOT let the negative reviews stop you from watching what is almost an old fashioned shoot 'em up movie with really great characters and actors, heart-stopping action scenes and almost too true CGI scenes. Three of us watched it together and we all said the same thing at the end - we LOVED it and we're REALLY glad we didn't let the reviews stop us from watching it. Like I said, I'm used to having to suspend belief - you have NO IDEA how many times they've shown our local airport, our little town, our coast - and those of us who live here (on the East Coast) know darn well it's been filmed out on the West Coast - they look NOTHING alike. Suspension of belief comes easy for us. Lighten up and let this movie take you away for an hour and a half or so for some really great action filled fun!s and actors, heart-stopping action scenes and almost too true CGI scenes.

I tried to purchase the Amazon.com copy without luck. Our dollar is on par so am not sure why there is such a discrepancy.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|David Gilmour is amazingly consistent.  He sings and plays exactly as he did in 1979, and at 66 years old, he hasn't slowed one bit.  This amazing concert will remind you of the incredible songwriting and orchestration that made Pink Floyd the 11th top-selling artist of all time.  Add to the usual Pink Floyd suspects the cameos by Crosby and Nash and especially David Bowie, and you have a pantheon of talented artists.

B0079J28NW|3.0|My review will most likely be a lone, dissenting voice but I think it is worth recording.<br /><br />By way of a disclaimer, I saw this movie in 1968 when I was 7 years old, when it came out in the movie theaters. I remember being surrounded by a lot of long-haired people who were smoking in a very large theater somewhere on the West Side of New York. It has always been and remains one of my very favorite films ever.<br /><br />I bought the Blu-ray disc pre-order and did not watch it until tonight about two months later. At first I had set the audio preset to two channels stereo but had to switch midstream to the mono for the following reasons. There is also another point I will make:<br /><br />First, the sound effects, including the music are mixed way higher than the voices speaking in the film. That means the volume has to be set very high to hear the dialogue, which means the music and sound effects volume will literally blast you out of your seat. We had to turn off the stereo and listen on the TV speakers because it was ear-shattering and I could not disturb my neighbors. The balance between volume levels is acceptable on the original monaural mix, meaning that the music and sound effects once again do not overwhelm the dialogue.<br /><br />Another, sad complaint I think is that on my 720 dpi Samsung 32 inch screen the digital remaster of the print is just too hard edged. One comment I made to my friend was that it looked like it was re-mastered on a different drug than it was originally produced on. The eye-popping colors, hard edges and super-sharp images in my opinion detract from the softer, more \\"user-friendly\\" analog version I have seen over the years. I have never taken DMT but this is what I imagine it must be like, it was so pronounced it basically gave me a headache to watch.<br /><br />In all, I feel they over-produced this master, both by focusing so hard on the audio to the detriment of the dialogue, which is lost in the mix, and the super-sharprendition of animation that were clearly hand-drawn etc.<br /><br />The music, however, is masterfully produced and when the songs come on it is all glory.<br /><br />As I said, this is likely a minority opinion but I would have preferred something a little truer to the conception of the film where it just seemed softer and more accessible, truly a peaceful spirit in the film which I feel is lost in this blu-ray remaster, maybe that is the nature of Blu-ray, but in an animated film you really see the difference and I not 100% pleased.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, if I could I would exchange it for an earlier reproduction where I feel I could watch the film without the associated angst.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing.

I am on the final book called Fifty Freed and I am taking my time reading it as I don't want it to end.  The characters in this book, Christian and Ana truly give you the kind of Love that you don't want to be away from.  So absorbing.
030758836X|4.0|Quick recap: On their fifth anniversary, Amy Dunne goes missing, and her husband, Nick, is the prime suspect.<br /><br />GONE GIRL was a pretty darn good summer read! The novel is split into three sections: the set up, the twist, the pay off. As far as I'm concerned, the first section is by far the strongest of the novel. Without giving too much away (I try not to spoil), it gives the reader a chance to meet Nick and Amy... sort of..., but we see them as voyeurs, as the police and outside observers would see them. The case against Nick builds page by page, block by block. In this section, we also come to know that both characters are unreliable narrators--Nick goes back to tell us things he 'forgot', while Amy's journal also holds er own confessions of unreliability when she tells us she 'might have exaggerated' or 'forgot' things. In a journal? Who lies in a journal and then admits it to themself? Amy, apparently.<br /><br />The second section deconstructs the first section, and gives us another angle of view entirely. Up until this point, GONE GIRL reminded me strongly of Scott Turow's PRESUMED INNOCENT (in tone, not particulars), and I can't help but think that it could have been well served thematically to retain that perspective until closer to the end. Still, this section is interesting.<br /><br />Where the book falls a little is toward the end of the third section, when a series of Scooby-Doo 'twists' happen. They strain incredulity, and I found myself eye rolling a couple of times. Flynn finishes a stronger than I expected, though, with a final chilling line that left me wondering.<br /><br />This is a fun book. It retains some of Turow's phrasing and pacing, which works beautifully for this novel. It fumbles a bit near the end, but recovers and finishes well. Overall, it is much stronger than SHARP OBJECTS, Flynn's last novel; I like to see growth in an author, so I liked that. Definitely a re-readable book!
0812981448|4.0|I give a detailed review here (and I'm giving away this book for FREE in September):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />But here is a snippet:<br /><br />I read pretty fast, so I was halfway through in no time. His style of writing and anecdotal emphasis made it read that much faster. What I thought was going to be a detailed recounting of his glorious story turned out to be nothing like it. Yes, he shares bits of how Toms gets started...but it is nothing like I expected. It was very inspiring, moving and informational at the same time. What I didn't realize was that the book is less about him starting Toms Shoes & more about YOU starting something that matters. {Which it says on the back of the darn book, duh.}<br /><br />Halfway through the book, he asks you to stop and put the book down so that you can let it resonate in your own life. `What matters to you?' he prods as he walks you through the process of figuring that out. I genuinely took his advice, put the book down, and let it simmer. And simmer. It took a month or two for my personal inspiration to arrive. Once I wrote it all down and prayed through it, I picked the book back up and finished it in a day. He takes you from inkling to inspiration, all the way to implementation of your idea.<br /><br />I have to say, you don't need to wear Toms shoes, or give back to orphans or desire to solve world hunger to enjoy this book. But if you are entrepreneurial by nature {which I am!} or you long to work in line with your passion, then this book is a must-read. Take that advice from someone who let it collect dust out of ridiculousness and fear. I sincerely wish I had read this last year when I received it, but I honor the process that my mind took to be ready to receive the information. I am not re-counting all that the book entails because I think it is about taking a personal journey. Each person gets out of it what they put in, and I hope his book continues to inspire people to live out their passions. I know it has for me.

B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Love this game-It's really clever and let's you use your brain...but in a relaxing way...not like some games where everything is rush rush rush. This game let's  you take the time to think about what to do.  You make a move- then the spiders make a move...but it's  not a slow game either...it's  just right! I found myself laughing out loud when the spiders got the bug. I'm having more fun with it than I thought possible with an game app...and it was free!...I would have spent money on it easy...and btw...it's  also cute as heck and as the levels get harder they give you things to defeat the spiders...for instance-you can freeze them or use scissors to cut the web...Now excuse me while I get back to my poor scared little  bugs...Mrs. Rick

The Sony 3D player did an update that would not let the disc see if it was 3D. Working with Sony tech support we found if you change the 2D setting from auto to 1080P then the disc would play fine in 3D. No need to change the 3D setting, it can stay \\"auto\\". Each player has its own firmware update, hopefully most players can keep the default auto setting. I do not want the disc to check for a 3D player, just play the movie.<br />Also the subtitles are not on the 3D disc, only the 2D disc has subtitles.

B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Not a fun movie.  Enjoyed watching however.  Lack of closed caption is definately a major negative.  Other entities provide closed caption.  I don't know why Amazon.com is so behind the times they need to move into the 21st century.  I probably won't stream any more movies from Amazon.com until they can provide closed caption.  I would like to know if a movie has closed caption before I pay for a streaming movie.
1401322786|3.0|The measurement of time, Mitch Albom's parable tells us, distinguishes man from other animals.  Man alone measures time, and man alone fears time running out.  Every parable has a moral, and Albom's is this:  we should replace fear of losing time with an appreciation of the time we have.  It is a worthy lesson, even if the parable flounders as it makes its way there.<br /><br />The Time Keeper imagines Father Time as a real person.  In biblical times, Father Time's name was Dor.  While his childhood friend Nim was building the Tower of Babel, Dor was learning how to measure time.  When Dor's wife becomes ill, Dor tries to climb the tower in the hope that by reaching the heavens, he can make time stop.  When the tower falls, Dor is banished to a cave and cursed with immortality because he offended God.  By teaching man to count time, \\"the wonder of the world he has been given is lost.\\"<br /><br />Alternating with Dor's story are those of two other characters.  Victor Delamonte, the fourteenth-richest man in the world, has a tumor on his liver.  At the age of 86, he is running out of time.  He resolves to buy more time.  Sarah Lemon is a smart but unattractive seventeen-year-old who falls in love with an insensitive hunk named Ethan.  When he rejects her, she doesn't know if she wants to keep living -- she wants less time than she has been allotted.  Dor's penance -- his chance to atone for the sin of inventing clocks -- requires him to intervene in the lives of Victor and Sarah.<br /><br />The Time Keeper is easily read in one or two sittings (depending upon how long you sit).  Albom uses simple sentences to tell a simple story.  As is generally true of parables, simplicity is The Time Keeper's defining characteristic.  The proposition it initially advances -- that counting moments leads to misery, that we should lead simple and grateful lives -- isn't particularly profound, but the nature of a parable is to illustrate an obvious lesson.<br /><br />But is it an honest lesson?  Dor was punished (or readjusted) because he wasn't content to live his life without counting its moments, but inquiry and invention are not a wasted or evil use of one's life.  There is much to be said for the human capacity to plan and to inquire, traits that inevitably lead to an understanding of time.  Albom's point -- that we need to spend our life appreciating the time we have rather than fretting about the time we don't have -- is a good one, but it's also a half-truth.  The downside of measuring time is balanced by countless upsides, a reality that Albom's story ignores.  The sense of urgency, the race to accomplish something before the clock runs out, has led to better medicine, longer lives, greater comfort, serious literature, beautiful art, and a host of other worthy accomplishments that would never have been achieved if everyone were content to tend sheep and feel grateful for a quiet, uneventful life.<br /><br />Albom's expressly stated notion that life was more satisfying before the invention of time measurement is unsupportable.  Time measurement actually began with prehistoric man, long before Dor, and cave dwelling isn't my idea of a fulfilling life.  There's an undertone in Albom's story -- simplicity is good, progress is bad -- that is reflected in Albom's vision of a future in which people have \\"forgotten how to feel.\\"  A few hundred years from now, Albom posits, people will long for \\"a simpler, more satisfying world.\\"  Albom's peek at the future is a denial of history:  life might have been simpler in biblical times, but it was also shorter and more difficult.  Lives were consumed by the struggle to survive.  The slaves who were building the Tower of Babel had little opportunity to feel grateful for their existence.  The ensuing millennia haven't made people any less capable of \\"feeling,\\" and it's difficult to believe that humans will lose that innate ability as time marches on.  People are fond of believing that everything was betterin the past, but as Woody Allen [[ASIN:B005MYEQ4U recently demonstrated]], the present is a better place in which to live.<br /><br />Of course, parables aren't meant to be taken literally, and if one reads the story solely as a reminder of the need to appreciate whatever time we have, the message resonates.  There are conventional novels that make the same point with greater depth and more subtlety ([[ASIN:1842322486 The Chequer Board]] is a favorite), but parables aren't meant to be subtle or deep.  Nor are the gaps in internal logic as important in a parable as they would be in a different kind of story.  At its root, The Time Keeper tells a good story, has a sweet ending, and delivers half of a universal truth -- but only half.in the past, but as Woody Allen [[ASIN:B005MYEQ4U recently demonstrated]], the present is a better place in which to live.<br /><br />Of course, parables aren't meant to be taken literally, and if one reads the story solely as a reminder of the need to appreciate whatever time we have, the message resonates.

0743270754|5.0|The more I study American history, the more I realize how little I really know. I just completed Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals in which she explores the inter-workings, personalities and politics of the Lincoln administration.  Every American schoolboy or schoolgirl knows that Lincoln presided over the most difficult period in American history save the George Washington era.  Most know that he struggled with a series of second rate generals until Grant emerged. And that he was tragically assassinated just as the War Between the States ended.<br />But how many of us know that many of the cabinet members opposed Lincoln in the primary?  That many of those thought he was unqualified for the office?  That one of them - Salmon Chase - actually tried to build support to oppose Lincoln in the 1864 election?  Or that Lincoln's opponent in 1864 was former General McClelland, who so famously failed to take advantage of his superior numbers early in the war.  Or that the Democratic Party had a substantial \\"peace wing\\" that was prepared to negotiate an end to the war in 1864 that would not have required the freeing of slaves?  Or that his first love was one Ann Rutledge, who he undoubtedly would have asked to marry, however, she died very young, sending young Lincoln into a deep lasting depression.  He was in such despair that friends feared for his life.<br />The book summarizes his early life, but really begins with Lincoln as a young lawyer in Illinois, and tracks his career, which had numerous, severe setbacks, through his very clever strategy to win the 1860 nomination, up to his assassination.  My admiration at Lincoln's talents only grew as I read this work.  I had no understanding of his deep political skills but Goodwin brings out his knowledge of human nature, ability to connect to people, and his careful analysis of the landscape that let him out-maneuver rivals.  The book is appropriately subtitled The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln.<br />Lincoln, with his plain appearance, lack of a formal education (he was almost entirely self-taught, quite literally reading with candlelight after long hard days of farm labor), from the humblest of situations, was consistently underestimated by the press, rivals and even foreign governments.  To a certain extent he probably used that to his advantage.  Widely disparaged in the press and by political opponents as \\"that rail splitter from Illinois\\" as the Presidential election unfolded, and even more in the early days of his administration, by the end of the war, \\"rail splitter\\" was a term of admiration and endearment.<br />Of course, as the title suggests, he was also able to overlook, not just slights, but harsh, demeaning rhetoric from rivals to recruit the best possible Cabinet ministers.  (As an aside, one forgets how the Cabinet has exploded in membership - his consisted only of a handful, including War, Interior, Treasury, Attorney General, State and Postmaster General.  It is probably time to downsize our current Cabinet).  Many were reluctant recruits, believing that they were far more qualified to be President than Lincoln.  Over the next five years however, he earned their respect, trust, and confidence and to a man they came to the realization that he was one of the greatest Presidents.<br />One of the interesting facets of Abraham Lincoln was his spirituality.  He was clearly a Bible scholar.  His mother provided most of his early education, in part by reading scripture.  He was seen on numerous occasions, including during his Presidency, studying his Bible, and could quote scripture - including some fairly obscure passages, at will.  We can assume that he believed in God, however, it isn't nearly so clear that he believed in an afterlife.<br />To her credit, Ms. Goodwin does not speculate on what would have happened in a Lincoln second term.  He made it crystal clear that he was completely opposed to a vindictive approach to the conquered South. His death put (only barely qualified) Andrew Johnson into the office.  One can question whether there was anyone who could have stepped in to follow the brilliant and immensely capable Lincoln and succeeded, but it certainly was not Johnson.  Lincoln's death was a tragedy for the country, quite possibly for two generations, as the incredibly corrupt Reconstruction, rise of segregation and the Ku Klux Klan ensued.<br />When I read this kind of wide-ranging history, with references to hundreds of diary entries, letters, speeches, etc. I marvel at the time it must take to write such a work.  Ms. Goodwin, in her notes, mentions 10 years of research.  But she is not just a great researcher, she is a great story teller.  This could have been dry and dull but it is the opposite - great history and a great read.<br /><br />Highly recommended.arely qualified) Andrew Johnson into the office.

030758836X|2.0|The only reason I bought this book was because it was a best-seller at Amazon and I am hugely disappointed.<br />One of my biggest complain is the way the book ends. It seems the author ran out of ideas to end the book and so she decided to take the simple path and \\"just end it\\" in between.<br />The first half of book moves at a very good pace with a nice built up of characters. But the mystery also ends very soon in the book. The latter 1/4 of the book is just wasted pages.It seems the author did not wrack her brains to see how can she make the story more interesting.<br />So, I wont call it one of the finest mystery novels ever - Nopes, not at all.<br />Should you read it? I wont recommend it. I would have preferred reading another fiction with a better story.<br />Why should you still buy it? To understand why so many people have given it such a bad rating.
B008GX2YQQ|4.0|Animal Collective have had a pretty epic four album run beginning with 2004's freak-folk 'Sung Tongs' and ending with their previous full-length, 2009's 'Merriweather Post Pavilion,' their most accessible (and most successful) album to date. Never a band to rest on their laurels, each album was a reaction to and near antithesis of the previous, and this trend continues with 'Centipede Hz.' Unfortunately it never quite reaches the heights of its predecessors, imo, though it's still an admirable--if a bit overbearing--effort.<br /><br />Whereas 'Merriweather' was very Noah Lennox-dominated (he being the mellower, more traditionally \\"pop-friendly\\" of the two), Avey Tare's spazzamatazz songwriting and vocal stylings take center-stage here, and combined with the insanely kaleidoscopic and harsh noises coming from every which way, results in an overall vibe that's much more busy-sounding and, well....abrasive is the best word I can think of. Maybe \\"headachy\\" is more accurate. This tone is set early with opener 'Moonjock' and rarely lets up throughout its 54 minutes. There's some respite during Noah's handful of calmer, slightly more ambient tracks, but the assault on the senses can still be a bit much at times.<br /><br />But if you dig through all the clutter, there are some lush melodies buried underneath; they just may take some time to unearth. \\"Wide Eyed,\\" sung by multi-instrumentalist Deakin (back from his four-year hiatus), is a good example. It's an extremely well-written, oddly-structured song that has an infectious hook and bouncing rhythms reminiscent of Neu! or Faust, yet it's difficult to listen to on headphones with the volume turned up, due to the piercing noises constantly bombarding the listener. There are some truly impressive bits of intertwining melodies spread throughout the album, but it takes several listens to learn how to listen \\"through\\" all the other stuff. It's definitely not impenetrable, but it's not as easy to get lost in its psychedelic soundscapes as past albums.<br /><br />If you do stick it out, you'll find that 'Centipede Hz' has it's rewards. \\"Applesauce\\" is probably one of their catchiest, just-plain-fun songs of their entire career, requiring hardly any work on the listeners part. Elsewhere, you'll hear plenty of layered, insane Krautrock rhythms meshed with paranoid lyrical musings and melodies; 80's-ish new-wave dance; even classic rock-style guitar riffs. \\"Amanita\\" closes the album, and, unlike it's lethal namesake (a highly poisonous mushroom often mistaken for the \\"magic\\" kind), is five and a half minutes of zoned-out bliss. It's a perfect, almost soothing end to an album that made it, at times, a chore to get there. When you do, you'll probably breath a huge sigh of relief. Not because you're glad it's all over, but because the whole album is like an hour-long schizoid journey, with highs and lows (and heavenly blows), and quite a few moments of near-madness, so it'll feel like a small accomplishment before you dive right in again.<br /><br />And the next time it will all make a little more sense.

B0036S4C6G|5.0|The Pulitzer Prize winning book, A Visit From the Goon Squad, introduces us to an especially odd, yet all too familiar, crowd. They are all, more or less, tangentially interconnected, and it is not until the end that we see how each thread of the web holds their lives together. Through the course of the book we see through the varied eyes of an emotionally wounded kleptomaniac, the PR rep to a genocidal Latin American dictator, a psychotic celebrity journalist on the verge of a meltdown, and teenage punk rockers looking for their big break, among many others. Jennifer Egan's vivid prose is immersive, sweeping the reader back and forth in Time, from the 1970s to the 2020s, and in Space, between three continents. It chronicles the death of the analog world, and points forward to the new dawn of the digital age, where we all are becoming, like the characters in this book, somehow interconnected, and \\"facebooked\\" together. The threads of this digital web are often thin and imperceptible, but have no doubt, they are there, and there to stay. This is unconventional, and satisfying storytelling, both epic in scale, yet focused, and subtle.
B005FISBTO|1.0|As other commenters have noted, the previews, which are annoyingly on every single disc, and which cannot be skipped, show the last 5 seconds of the season and reveal a major spoiler.

0375836675|4.0|I am the messenger, is the story of Ed Kennedy (19) who works illegally for a cab firm, has only three real friends and epitimses the phrases 'waste of space'. Between a chainsmoking mother, a stingy friend with 40grand in the bank, a girl he loves to bits but 'likes him too much', a quiet friend with a tattoo of Jimmy Hendrix, and 'the doorman' who smells like death, you would think Ed Kennedy would be last one chosen to be a hero or a saint.<br /><br />After a failed bank robbery though, Ed Kennedy becomes the messenger, receiving messages of his next mission via aces. Through acts of kindness to those around him, Ed is being lead by the hand though a journey of self discovery and sometimes, of course is helped with the advice of a pie eating hit-men.<br /><br />This book is YA, and it knows its audience. It was an extremely easy read, but although the language is simple - the meaning isn't. Marcus Zusak shows his talent again with this novel, and although in my opinion it can't compare to the book thief, it is still excellent.<br /><br />When i first picked it up, i was hoping for the beautiful descriptive language of the book thief, but this wasn't the case. The language of the book doesn't reflect the writer but reflects the book and its character. I don't give this a full five stars, only because of part of the ending (the ending is still very good), where we discover who is behind the messages - slightly disappointed with it as i thought Ed's first guess near the end would have been a brilliant twist and appropriate.

1595141715|4.0|13 Reasons Why, by Jay Asher, is a work of young adult fiction that all students in junior high and high school should be required to read. The novel captures its readers by the use of duel narrators, two high school students, Hannah Baker and Clay Jensen. Clay receives a mysterious box containing seven cassette tapes that happen to be the voice of Hannah Baker his fellow class mate and previous crush. Although, Hannah had committed suicide two weeks before these tapes fall into Clay's hands. Hannah takes Clay and the reader on her journey that brought her to the decision to end her life. She tells her memories to Clay, explaining that him along with 12 other people had affected her to the point where the only way out was to take her own life. This novel covers the struggles and hardships that many young adults, like Hannah, have been forced to face and how some kids find the only way to deal with them is to give up.  Though at times the story can seem morbid and even depressing, it is a story that many teens can relate to. Jay Asher does something only a brave author can do, touch upon a subject that is so sensitive that it is rarely discussed in public. However, today, more than ever, adolescences are taking their lives from the result of bullying and ruined reputations in school. This is a novel that has the potential to help young adults find help and illustrates how serious the issue of teen suicide has become in our society today.

I will agree that the terminology does get repetitive but I still enjoyed this book as much as the first. I have began 3 and cant wait to see what happens yet I'm sad I wont have any more to read.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Books 2 & 3 are 5 star, book 1 I would rate porn @ 3 stars.  I truly did enjoy the book and have not read anything like it before.  Books 2 & 3 were truly enjoyable.  I do not know how one could make this into a movie without taking away from the deep side of Christian Grey.  Ana is one strong willed individual who is very into anything to make her man happy.<br />ONE WANTS TO PICK THIS BOOK UP TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
1597801585|5.0|Just when you thought top quality science fiction was a thing of the past and that you would have to satisfy yourself with re-reading Asimov and Clarke along comes this book. A dystopian vision of the future after petroleum and fossil fuels have run out and genetically engineered crops and diseases run rampant killing millions. The world has contracted due to the shortage of cheap energy and global corporations control the foodstuffs of millions by genetically engineering diseases to kill off all competitors. Add to this a healthy dose of conspiracy and a Japanese girl designed as a rich man's plaything who now wants to be free and you have one of the best sci-fi novels of the last decade. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Thank you Mrs. Carter. Her hints in these Reviews moved me forward at last. A few others are stuck where I was with the matches, fishbowl and combination. email me if you want to spamevader2002@yahoo.com<br />The problem is if you do things in the wrong order, you don't get a clue you need. But you can work around it.

B008RTE066|5.0|Anyone who doesn't appreciate the daft humor and bizarre \\"storyline\\" of Magical Mystery Tour is not much of a Beatles fan. Stop being so uptight, folks. Let yourself revisit a glorious age and enjoy the ride. The whole film is a hoot. The I Am the Walrus scene and the Beatles dancing down the staircase are worth the price of admission alone. And this deluxe edition looks fantastic. It was put together with care, and I'm sure the only thing I'll be complaining about is that they should have included more deleted scenes and excess footage.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Customer Service was excellent. They had me order the item with promo credits that they put on my account and then they waived my shipping fee. As long as the product gets here in time and holds up better than the original I'll be a happy camper.

B002NWOOXW|1.0|I watched this film for a second time today.  You might be asking, \\"Wow.  Do you have bad taste?\\" and you'd have a point.  But that wasn't the reason that I watched it again.  I saw it quite a few years ago and hated it and I thought, \\"Maybe I didn't give it a chance.  Let's watch it again to be sure.\\"<br /><br />Well, it's as bad as I originally thought; maybe worse.  Actually, I think that it is one of the worst movies in the history of cinema, mostly because it has a decent cast and yet it is still a total stinker.  Bad music, bad acting, worse direction, and horrible writing doomed this dog from the beginning.  Everything seems to be wrong about this film:  the fake British accent by the star; the music; the dialog; etc. etc.  What do the Brits think about this film?  My guess is that they hate it even more than I.<br /><br />But I did like the first film; I thought that it was funny and entertaining.  But it is the case that most sequels are not as good as the first in the series, and this film keeps up that tradition.  But it does it in such a glaring way that it is appalling.<br /><br />I just screened and reviewed \\"Heartburn\\" and I ripped that pretty bad.  But in comparison, I would rather watch that film 10 times over this disaster even once more.  Watch - and cringe - at your own risk.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is the best and I mean the best. It is such a cool adventure, I cant even explain haw cool it is. The Lost City is full of things you would never have immagened in your entire life. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing out there better than this game. You wont regret paying a dollar for this game. I will also regimens it for all ages because I find that people of all ages will find it really entertaining. Believe me when I say it, you want this game as much as everyone else around you. And you cant denie it.

B007PTJOV0|2.0|This so ripped off Mario super bros! It is exactly the same! The only difference is what device you get it on. Besides, there is only one world! I got it on my ipod touch and I wouldn't dare get it on my kindle fire!
B001O1O71C|3.0|Everyone is extrememly interested in this book because of the intensity of the subject...the Holocaust. The book is not too graphic. For example they don't flat out say \\"the man stabbed him with a knife.\\" They will tell you things so that you can understand what happened. For example \\"What happened made Bruno cry and Gretel turn very pale.\\" This is one of those stories where I really shouldn't give away the ending but I have to warn you it is not the most appealing ending. Also, this book is a bit boring in the beginning. It has a very slow start and Bruno does not meet the Jewish boy until about halfway through the book.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|This is stupid. Who cares if there us adds? They don't get it the way of anything. The free version is fine even with the adds. We shouldn't waste our time and money on an add free game when we can get it for free with adds. I only recommend this tot people who absolutely hare adds will not mind paying a dollar to get the add-free version of angry birds.
0812550706|4.0|I am not much of a science-fiction reader, finding it far-fetched. I prefer stories closer to terra firma. I read Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\" in elementary school, but forgot what it was about. It did not excite me during those years as much as Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". This book is geared toward young adults, and they would enjoy it, I believe.<br /><br />But \\"Childhood's End\\" would be a suitable subtitle for this work. The story is about children, and power, influence and manipulation. It is about what a young boy encounters in the maturity process. Orson Scott Card brings a fresh revelation to the reader concerning the travails of growing up. While he does this he writes a science-fiction story that is inviting, informative and satisfying. The plot is credible, the aliens do not dominate the tale. The characters are real, with the possible exception of too many gullible, immature adults. Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin climbs to adulthood responsibility at warp speed long before he reaches adolescence. Some of his endowment may be unreal to another reader, but I will give Card some slack. Ender's older sister, Valentine, is far more pleasing to me.<br /><br />The ending left me with some hope, but as lost as Major Tom. The far-reaches of Ender's galaxy tap into fantasy, and I am left longing for terra firma.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|there is no point in having angry birds space if there is already a lot of different angry bird games. Even though it has s pretty cool twist, it isn't really worth three dollars. I never got the game but I play it on my friends iPad. She says its awesome but I always tell her it is cool but not worth the money. If you did not clearly get the message, DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!

B004GBIE3Y|5.0|The part of this movie that deals with mental illness isn't as important as the part that deals with being human. A mental ward is the backdrop because who isn't crazy in one way or another.  Or, as Rosalind says in \\"As You Like It' : \\"Love is a kind of madness......\\" & I find it very hard to argue with Shakespeare. That the main character finds love in this ward & seems to survive both can be seen as a miracle in itself, especially because it's young love & we all know how that can turn out as Shakespeare has so will illustrated. This movie isn't terribly deep or revealing, but in the end, the guy gets the girl & that's what really matters, isn't it?
030758836X|4.0|This is not so much a murder mystery as it is an exploration of personalities and the tendency we humans have to adjust or hide certain personality traits in order to better appeal to others.  In other words, we are always selling ourselves, but inherent in the selling is a LOT of false advertising.  And according to Flynn, most failed marriages are akin to consumer dissatisfaction and buyer's remorse once we realize that neither party to the relationship is who they pretended to be.<br /><br />As many have alluded, the mystery angle has a wallop of a plot twist that is very effective.  It cannot be discussed without revealing too much about it, or the events leading up to it.  However, once it happens, the reader is no longer solving a mystery but is just waiting to see how things play out.  If you are looking for a whodunnit that will keep you guessing until the end, you will enjoy the first half of this book immensely, but the second half may frustrate you.  If you're like me, and you enjoy good writing and don't mind watching the chips fall, you will like the first two-thirds of this book.  But as other readers have said, no matter your tastes, the final chapters are a bit dissapointing.  I believe it is because Flynn leads us to sympathize with one of the main characters despite some very big flaws, only to suddenly render that character just as unsympathetic (and, quite frankly, unbelievable) as any other.  If I had put the book down before this final bit, I think I would have been quite satisfied.  Instead, I was as frustrated as I am getting off the phone after a girlfriend wastes hours of my time discussing her bad relationship and seeking advice that I know she will never heed.
0307352145|3.0|The book presents some interesting research in layman's terms. However, I felt that it unfairly paints extroverts in a negative light. It seems that the author's bias is showing through. I am an introvert myself, and I felt a little uncomfortable when extroverts were being described as being more likely to be psychopaths.<br /><br />Perhaps, a little more analysis into the research would have helped. However, as the book stands as is, it's hard for me to tell what parts of the book are based on factual research, and which parts are the author's bias<br /><br />Interesting book though. Just don't expect detailed analysis.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought the book was well written.  I'm really glad that in book #2 you learn more about Christian.  Can't wait to read book #3.
030746363X|5.0|I have heard interviews with Timothy Ferriss and the book was all I expected it to be!  He packs alot of analytical info in it but he warns you...skip to the basics and you still get plenty of information.  Ferriss puts forth some intriguing and radical ideas but I think he's just ahead of the rest in his ideas! This is not your \\"same old same old\\" fitness and nutrition book.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|In No Easy Day the author, Mark Owen, says \\"We are not superheroes\\".  He then goes on to describe a mission that becomes plan B before they are on the ground.  The helicopter he is riding in then crashes and the mission changes again.  Without hesitation the team goes on to execute the mission sucessfully.  They don't mention the helicopter crash until after Bin Laden is dead because they were too busy doing their jobs.  That might be all in a days work for Navy Seals but to the rest of us it sounds like superheroes.<br /><br />He says that he wrote the book to \\"set the record straight\\" and there was a tremendous amount of detail that I didn't know.  He also says \\"if you are looking for secrets, this is not your book\\".  This is still a 5 star read even without any secrets.  One thing I didn't know was just how much a coward Bin Laden was that night but I won't ruin the story by telling you why.  I highly recommend this book.
0385342055|2.0|As a Shopaholic fan I was looking forward to reading this book. I really wanted to love it, but I have to admit I was very disappointed.<br /><br />First of all, the plot is highly unrealistic. Are we supposed to believe that Becky, Luke and Minnie have been living with Becky's parents for two years because of financial problems? Since Luke is a wealthy businessman and Becky can afford expensive clothes, I don't understand why they couldn't rent an apartment.<br /><br />By reading the title, I thought Minnie would be extravagant and fond of luxury, just like her mother. Instead, she's just an annoying brat who keeps running everywhere and screaming \\"miiine!\\" everytime she sees something. For some reason, Becky thinks her daughter is perfect and refuses to admit that Minnie is too spoiled. Becky is a terrible mother and I don't understand her desire to have other children. She's not even able to control her only daughter! As for Luke, though he admits that Minnie is a problematic child, he remains a workaholic who barely spends time with his family, so he's not a good parenting figure either.<br /><br />Then there's all this ridiculous \\"plot\\" about Becky wanting to throw an enormous party for Luke's birthday, even though Luke doesn't care at all. The party thing would have been okay as a secondary plot, not as the basis of the whole story. It seems to me like there's no real plot, no suspense compelling the reader to turn the page.<br /><br />Also, I expected Becky to grow up a little bit, since she's now a married woman and a mother. Instead, she remains an immature girl who keeps lying to everyone about everything. Why can't she just tell the truth sometimes?! At least in the previous books, she was able to recognize her mistakes and ask for forgiveness, and that's why she was so endearing. In this novel, however, she treats her parents without respect and then expects them to be okay with all her lies.<br /><br />I really miss the old Becky, the one who was sweet,funny and charming. Why has she turned into this crazy woman who throws extravagant parties and lies about every single thing? I want Becky back!!!

B008EG700U|4.0|Jens Lekman writes the kind of wistful, lovelorn pop that can sound too precious and twee when mishandled--and even he has had some missteps--but you won't find any of them here.  This is a collection of sweet, understated, fragile pop gems.  Burt Bacharach himself would have been pleased with the mellow piano and sax groove of \\"Erica America\\", and the shuffling disco beats of \\"She Just Don't Want To Be With You Anymore\\" hide a sadness that has you tapping your toes until you realize that the song is much more serious than those drums led you to believe.  There is heartbreak here, but although you can feel the pain, Jens sort of seems like he is trying to laugh it off, tell you that \\"it's nothing...\\".  We know he's lying.  He's had his heart broken (again) and I am sad to hear it, but the music that he has given us is something beautiful and small, precious.  A very good album for those who love Jens.
B008476HBM|2.0|This has not survived the test of time. While it's easy to see why this was a popular story from the 19th century up to the 1950s, reading it now is like listening to cat negotiating its way out of a tangled quilt cover, amusing yes, but ultimately awful and frustrating.<br /><br />The motivations of the two central characters are purely woeful. I won't spoil anything but you don't want anyone to get the outcomes that they desire, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, no one.<br /><br />I can't say don't read it as it is so very ingrained in the pop culture of today, however I can say you should read the book trying to identify any part of it that wouldn't be made better by the introduction of zombies.
1936891026|5.0|\\"The War of Art\\" by Steven Pressfield is an excellent book and an easy read.<br /><br />I am a Social Entrepreneur and have been following my life's passion for over 10 years now. It has been very difficult at times because of the level of sacrifice needed to advance the cause. Our program is national in scope and makes a positive difference and inspires hundreds of thousands.<br /><br />Needless to say, I have allowed \\"Resistance\\" to stop me over and over again without even realizing it until now! I have so much inspiration, and enthusiasm, and so many ideas, welled up inside me just busting to get out....but again, I allowed \\"Resistance\\" to stop me dead in my tracks....therefore, a lot of the thoughts are just that and never leave the recesses of my mind.<br /><br />If you want to break FREE from Resistance and realize your amazing potential, read \\"The War of Art\\". This book is one of my favorites! Thank you Mr Pressfield....now on to read \\"Do The Work\\"!<br />R. Stocks
B007SGM084|5.0|After being encouraged to read Fifty Shades of Grey by friends, who then said that I would immediately want the next book after I finished the first...I decided to buy the Trilogy set and I was not disappointed at all!!<br />I was hooked and read all three during the weekend and have re-read the whole trilogy several times now.

B0038LB4TE|3.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher novels, some more than once. This particular book I have read twice. It is good. It's basically classic Jack Reacher but the writing is a notch or two above the Reacher average. However, Gone Tomorrow comes (in my view) nowhere close to the quality of 61 hours, which in my view is the absolute pinnacle of the third person Reacher novels. My rating for Gone Tomorrow would be 3.5 stars if that were possible, and 61 Hours would be a solid 5.0.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|[[ASIN:B007IXWL2C Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]I enjoyed the books, however, I believe she could have condensed the three books into one book easily.  After one reads the sex scenes four or five time, we get the picture, after that, they got boring.
B001NLKT60|5.0|After reading the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo I had to immediately get the next in the series and the story picks up right where the first left.  These are exciting and captivating books that I have found to be addicting.
B0014EU5XI|5.0|I recently purchased \\"Rancho Texicano\\" and thoroughly am loving it. My Z.Z. Top music had yet to be upgraded digitally,(also re-mastered, nice bonus!) and it had been awhile since I had listened to them. I have been enjoying this from \\"Le Grange\\" to \\"Legs\\". Forgot how much great music they made. Highly Recommend!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I found the story unoriginal and characters relatively boring.  So many better books out there...<br /><br />Spoiler alert...<br />When they changed the rules of the games to allow two people from the same district to win, I thought to myself, \\"it's going to be totally lame and uncreative if they change the rules back and Katniss and Peeta have to fight each other.\\"  Well what do you know....

B00144VBBS|5.0|I been a Toby Keith fan since way back, so even though I have almost all these hits, I bought it again.<br /><br />Something about his music just appeals to me. It gets my toe tapping and I just feel like I'm energized. I'm a country boy who don't like the big city too much. Don't trust those kind of folks. They do things differently than us. They're all about gender on gender relations. And I ain't up for that. No offense. I ain't judging no one but dam, I don't want that kind of stuff happening to me. I swear.<br /><br />I don't have nothing against them and I could see where some folks may find a guy like Toby Keith to be handsome and maybe you have a dream about you and Toby swimming in a pond and it starts to rain so you rush off back to the house and maybe you towel Toby off and you both just look at each other and get a sense that something deeper is going on. Then Toby takes his guitar and sings a slow one. It's then that I usually wake up.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. The later levels can be rather challenging. The earlier levels can be played with the kids. It is just a great all around game.
B005V1WZ10|3.0|I've always appreciated Korn's ability to move me, surprise me and just bring out the reverberation in my chest that makes the love for their music worthwhile.  Is that too much pressure to put on a band?  This CD was ok but I've come to expect more and didn't get it from this CD.  The fact that it is a coroboration with other bands doesn't make it better.  The original sound that Korn had seems to have become an afterthought.

0525953728|5.0|I'm only a quarter into this book, so, like another reviewer stated, I'm tentatively giving it 5 stars.  It's quite a page-turner thus far and every bit as interesting as I'd hoped. But that's not even really the point of this review.<br /><br />When I heard of the long-overdue killing of Bin Laden, I was elated.  And when I learned of the surrounding circumstances, and the shocking bravery and professionalism exhibited by Seal Team Six, I was as awestruck as I was proud.  If you're at all like me, you probably encountered similar emotions that evening.  Perhaps you, like me, wished you could thank them in person, shake their hands, and/or buy them a beer or bottle of champagne.<br /><br />Here's your chance to thank a member of Seal Team Six.  Even if you don't intend to read the book, buy it.  Doesn't matter if you're illiterate, support this man's efforts to not only hunt down America's number one enemy, but to give us a written account to boot (with the Pentagon threatening legal action no less).<br /><br />Seriously.  Stop reading reviews and buy the book.  It's literally the least you can do.

B000002H6C|4.0|The Frayed Ends of Sanity was the and still is the best song on this CD and they should have played and released it on the And Justice For All Live Boxed Set but alas it is not to be found, the only place that I could find it was on YouTube and it's sad that they did not play it while in San Diego when the boxed set was filmed.<br /> I love the snarliness of that song in particular because frankly some of the ways that these women think is beyond me. I would attribute it to them.
030758836X|4.0|I am not a typical reader of mystery/crime novels, but this was chosen by my book club and from the description it sounded interesting.  I couldn't put it down, reading it over a weekend.  I was guessing with every turn of the page and I had to keep myself from skimming ahead.  The fast-paced excitement is clever, but never felt contrived.  Typically I hate when I feel manipulated in books or movies, but I actually appreciated the feeling reading \\"Gone Girl.\\"  The ending did not necessarily satisfy me, but I'm happy it ended the way it did.  (I can't say much more for fear of spoiling it.)  Gillian Flynn is great at capturing both the male and female voice and I will definitely be reading her other titles.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|Nicolas Cage's best role, ever!  The normally deadpan and uneventful actor gets a chance to actually be pretty badass.<br />Cage plays John Milton, who broke out of Hell to rescue his baby granddaughter, who was kidnapped by the satanic cult that killed her parents.  Along the way he partners up with a jilted hottie named Piper (Amber Heard, 406 from Zombieland)and sets out on his quest with her help, as he has been in hell for a number of years and is unfamiliar with the world at large.<br />This movie is reminiscent of old school 70's style action movies, complete with badass cars and chase scenes.<br />WATCH THIS MOVIE in 3D, not 2D!! :)
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This was an eye opener for sure. It touched on the most simple aspects of life, that can turn into the most difficult.  A great tool for anyone trying to get a hold on the most basic coping skills.<br />Every well written, easy to read and even better application.

B0083EM24C|5.0|LOVE this album. Catchy tunes, softer tunes, socio-political lyrics, heartflet lyrics. Sit your butt down and read the lyrics along with these gorgeous songs. Some may say Angelakos' voice is a bit more controlled and dimmer than Manners. Unlike other artists that seem like the label's chained them down in their later releases (see Johanna Newsome), Angelakos feels more multidimensional and stronger.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm and avid reader and I came across this book via a Amazon recommendation.  For $2.99 I took a chance and boy am I glad I did!  I was sucked in right away and the tempo and story kept me engaged the entire time.  I can't wait for the next book and have been telling my friends about it.  I actually cared about the main character and the way Anthony writes has just enough detail but doesn't bog you down.  The characters are very complex but in a good way that makes them seem real.  My only complaint was the very tiny font; fortunately I was able to tweak it enough on my Kindle so I could read it.  I highly recommend this book, and I look forward to seeing what else the Author has to offer.  When is the next book????
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|So I got to finally listen to it on a REAL stereo and not from crappy YouTube and barely passable PC speakers. So I have a first hand experience now. And better for it!<br /><br /> According to the booklet liner notes Ezrin worked with a hard drive copy of the multi-tracks. He thanks the archiving community for their work. So I guess this is the modern way to archive things. So he did not actually work with a huge 16 track reel of tape, but a digital copy of the very same tracks.<br /><br />He makes it clear he wanted to stay true to the original tracks and only tweak them and gives them a modern massage so to speak.<br /><br />He admits to adding a few things that were necessary to keep the album true to its original form.<br /> He talks about how they would use up to two stereo masters running in sync with the multi-track tape to create a third tape that was to be the final stereo master and also used to make the masters for vinyl, cassette, and 8-track pressing. The synced stereo masters were used with sound effects on them or to have two songs flow into one another.<br /><br />He states the stereo masters news/dishes/car start/intro into `Detroit Rock City' the truck sounds during the song along with the car and truck crash between it and `King Of The Night Time World' were nowhere to be found and are gone.<br /> So to start off the album he had to use a stereo master of the intro, I'm guessing a CD copy of it. So the start of the album is no different than any original copy of it. But during the song he added newly created truck sounds that are nothing like the original. They are much more muddy, much deeper bass and nowhere near as detailed as the original. Also the car crash sounds linking `Detroit' & `King' some there are also newly created and different.<br /> The only other things added according to Ezrin are the omitted vocal in Beth and Ace's solo in `Sweet Pain'. Other than those things he stayed true to the original recording.<br /><br /> So the entirealbum now has a drier sound to it, nothing near as wet as the original release. The only reverb and echo in the multi tracks is what was recorded direct to tape during the actual recording.<br /> So I can only guess he added reverb and echo to vocals, guitars and entire songs on the fly while the 16 multi-track tape was running as they created the final stereo master. So those `on the fly' added reverbs and echo sounds do not exist here.<br />It's like getting and hearing basic raw master tracks before a lot of effects were added in the final process.<br /><br /> `Detroit Rock City'<br />So as I stated above the album starts off the same as any other time you sat down to listen to it. Once `Detroit' starts you realize it's something different. Paul's voice is cleaner, more clarity and without the deep hall echo.<br />The rhythm guitar parts have more clarity and in some cases more oomph, harder hitting but not extremely. The added truck sounds are strange so much deep bass they are almost non-discernable.<br /> When the guitar lead starts all the way through the second harmony part its almost out of place because the hall effect is recorded directly on the track making it stand out `wet' in a `dry' land but still works. But here is where you realize just how much Ezrin added his own idea of depth and presence he thought the album should have. The final polish if you will. The drums are slightly more present here but not by leaps and bounds.<br /><br /> `King Of The Night Time World'<br />Then the added car crash parts lead into `King Of The Nighttime World' getting around the same treatment as `Detroit' but sounds more like the original than most of the other songs minus the reverb and hall depth.<br />Paul's voice once again comes straight through. The guitars have a slight sound change but very minimal here.<br /><br /> `God Of Thunder'<br /> Benefits a lot here from it's previous form. More bass LFE and a little harder hitting but still not as much as I would like and not as much as an impact as the Alive II version. Because of the tweak to me it softens the heavier impact going into the pre-chorus as the original. It sort of takes on a level heaviness throughout and the slight build up to the chorus is less and just remains a level field from start to finish.<br />Not positive but it seems Ezrin's kids mumbling and such there may be some additions and frequency tweaks there too.<br /><br /> `Great Expectations'<br />My least favorite song on the album since day one. Gene's voice has more clarity as well as the boys choir does too. Their harmonies are much more audible now and not so muddy. I hear orchestra instruments here and there that are more noticeable possibly Ezrin bumped their volume to bring them more forward.<br /><br /> `Flaming Youth'<br />Much of the same here as well. Drums have been enhanced as well as some guitars. The little accent leads throughtout the song are dry and don't have the same effect as we're used to.<br />I edited out the remarks regarding the 'glitch' in the intro to the song as it is no longer valid due to Mercury-Island records having corrected the problem in the latest CD pressings.<br /><br /> `Sweet Pain'<br />Same treatment here too, but some added stuff. The women's harmonies are bumped up or added in the song right after the lead. Ace's lead here is just terrible and non-imaginative at all. Does not fit the song well at all. This is not a shining moment for Ace. I guess the story of Ace telling Bob and the band 'That's good enough I have a card game to go to' holds true. Here is where I wish Ezrin would have left the `Dick Wagner' version and had Ace's version as the extra track but it's just the opposite.<br /><br /> `Shout it Out Loud'<br />Now here's where things start to change drastically. Gene's bass is a monster now. Much more LFE low frequency boost almost overwhelming with the volume cranked. You can almost mistake it for a newly recorded bass track but it's not. It takes on a deeper bass more muddy sound. The drums are slightly more pronounced as well but nowhere near the bass guitar. The ending sounds strange because I'm used to that abrupt ending with echo and the echo is not there just a dry kachunk!<br /><br /> `Beth'<br />Here the acoustic guitar is brought back in and more forward and can be heard here and there but not a dominating force throughout. As in `Great Expectations' some of the orchestra instruments get LFE tweaks along with some being brought more forward in the mix I had not noticed so obvious as before.<br /><br /> `Do You Love Me'<br />Gets a massive LFE bass drum treatment and thumps so much more here than ever before along with the snare too. This is what I wished Ezrin could have done with the drums in `Shout It Out Loud' even though it sounds good as it is I think `Shout' would just devastate if he could have tweaked it the way he did `Do You'. The bells/chimes at the end of the song come through so much more and more upfront than before.<br /><br /> `Looks Like We Gonna Have Ourselves A Rock `n Roll Party'<br />I think this track originated on the hard drive. Ezrin tweaks it some as well. The mix is slightly different. Seems he fades it differently than the original. It disappears into the left speaker. Also the reverb, phaser effects are non-present. But still retains some direct reverb.<br /><br /> `Sweet Pain' (original)<br />Not much more to say here. Doesn't seem Ezrin did much here or touched it at all, sounds very much like the original 1976 mix. Wagner's solo has a lot of reverb on it and sounds as it does on the original release.<br /><br /> Basically the entire album has had frequency tweaks along with bringing certain instruments more to the forefront.<br />I think Ezrin did a good job without trying to re-invent the wheel. He had a good idea I'm just not sure how it will fly with hardcore and casual fans.<br />I have read some of the casual fans reactions on the web and they are not forgiving. Saying to save your money and it's not worth it and so on.<br /><br /> Ezrin noted that there was some clowning between tracks that were there on the hard drive but he decided to leave them out to keep the flow of the album intact. Those would have been great for a second disc added. I have `Shout It Out Loud' demo or rough mix with them laughing afterward so I have an idea what he's talking about.<br /><br /> So I'm not saying rush out and get this right away, my curiosity was raised enough I couldn't resist and I don't feel ripped off or anything like that. I agree with some of the web posters though it could have been a much bigger package and an ultimate proper 35th celebration of the album with added demos and maybe even things we've never heard before but it is what it is.<br /><br />This Saturday night I watched `KISS Meets The Phantom Of The Park' once again and noticed something that had slipped by me before. The night scene where the band and Melissa are gathered at the pool and Peter is singing `Beth'. The small vocal `AaaaAaah' that Ezrin added to Resurrected is there in this acoustic `Beth' version in the movie. If you listen the track it's not the acoustic demo short version that we've all heard before but sounds to be the actual track with all instruments removed except the acoustic guitar and Peter's voice. Now I have seen this movie hundreds of times and I know I caught that extra vocal but I never put two and two together till hearing `Resurrected'.<br /><br />In the movie especially seeing it when your young you just think it's an alternate version of `Beth' made for the movie and nothing more.<br /><br /> So hopefully this has given you some kind of insight into what it's all about and help you make the decision whether to get it for yourself at some point.<br /><br />It's a different fun new modern update experience of the album especially if you have been listeing to the original mix since 1976 and etched into your brain.

B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's My Perry? is a great puzzle app with more than enough levels and collectables. It includes very funny spoken lines by Major Managram, Doofenshmirtz and Carl. It's definitely worth the $0.99! :)
0736092269|5.0|as good as getting them in the book store<br />i will come back for more books here... and i got the books on time and great conditions just as new, because thats what they advertised
0525423281|4.0|Lola is quirky, colorful, and the type of girl who wears what she loves, no matter everyone else's opinions of her elaborate and amazing costumes. Lola's also the kind of girl who accidentally voices her feelings out loud when she's upset, and acts younger than her age because that's the easy way out of life's pesky problems. When a family from Lola's past moves back in next door, Lola's love life (and life, in general) becomes a bit more complicated. While Lola is no [[ASIN:0142419400 Anna]], she is incredibly endearing in the way that you remember your high school days and all the silly decisions you and your friends made when it came to love, life, and everything else. LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR is sweet, sad, humorous, and so much more than you might expect at first glance.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS: Cricket. So sweet, and I loved seeing his personality shine through the awkward moments. Family is at the heart of  Lola and the Boy Next Door, and it's great to have a protagonist's parents take an active interest in their child's life (Lola's dads, Andy and Nathan, were amazing characters). Overall, Perkins excelled in creating an authentic bunch of characters with their own unique quirks.<br /><br />LOWLIGHTS: Lola could be a little too immature. I wanted to shake some sense into her whenever she was being an idiot. Honestly, I think I would have enjoyed this more back when I was in high school - I might have found Lola a bit more tolerable. This book was good, but Perkins' debut novel was much better.<br /><br />NOTE: Anna & St. Clair from [[ASIN:0142419400 ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS]] make multiple appearances in this story, and are just as awesome as ever.
B008BM9L72|4.0|The first book took me by surprise but once reading really enjoyed it...  Really suits any age group with an open mind.  Bring on the movie!!!! Thanks heaps
1451627297|5.0|I read every Stephen King book until he went sic-fi and then he just lost me.  When I read the jacket of this book, I was intrigued but skeptical.  Boy, did I love this book!  It isn't like the thrillers of the old days, but it really shows that his ability to tell an amazing story, with characters you really love and care about, is alive and well.  I hope he writes more of these types of stories!  A really great read!
068987474X|5.0|I saw great reviews on this book, so I purchased it today. Couldn't put it down after I started it. I laughed my butt off during some of the comments. I am going through a divorce after 13 years of marriage, so it has been a while since I dated. I reconnected with a high school interest and have been getting very mixed signals. I bought this book to shed some light on it. I found this book to be very insightful. After 13 years of marriage, I lost myself and forgot what it feels like to be truly happy and what I deserve in a relationship. This book emplowered me to understand the mixed signals and the games of dating. It gives you the basics and allows you to use your own judgement. Use this as a tool ladies, not an all encompassing dictionary to love. You will enjoy it! As for me, I cut my losses and moved on...
030758836X|4.0|I was intrigued by the jacket description of this book, and was not disappointed with it at all!  I was looking for an intelligent, but beachy read and this was it!  Highly recommend!  I went on to read another book and Gillian Flynn and loved it as well!
B003EYVXV4|1.0|Ok I'm going to review this movie as a movie and not a book, for you fanboys of the book I'm talking to you. A good book doesn't equate to a good movie and this one is a classic example of that. I'm seeing a lot of 5 star reviews of this movie which after watching it and reading some of your reviews makes me seriously question whether you're giving those reviews for the book or the actual movie.<br /><br />The cinematography was crap, the chick that played the Katniss character was ok, other than that the acting was pretty terrible, the direction was garbage, the storyline is flat, plots are uninteresting and the characters are incredibly boring. The romance was very cheesy.<br /><br />On a personal note I almost fell asleep twice, no movie has done that to me since I watched Eragon lol.

034580404X|5.0|OH MY GOODNESS!! i looooved this trilogy!! the ending of the third book seemed like it was open for another book! hopefully the author is working on it now! in the end i think we are all hopeless romantics :) the bedroom parts are pretty detailed so if you cant handle reading that kind of stuff this isnt the book for you! hope you all enjoy it as much as i did!!..oh and i heard they are working on a movie!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was by far the best read for me in a long time.  It only took me 6 days to finish all three.  I hope she writes another one.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|well written, enjoyable and light - enjoyed Rose's character and her dog, Muffy, was great too! I Haven't decided if I'll read anymore in the series but definitely liked this first one.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A twisty tale where you initially feel sorry for the wife whose husband is having an affair, after they move out of Manhatten and back to his home town. But all is not as it first appears...Brilliantly written to make you identify and empathise alternately with each main character, as they tell their own version of the same story. An almost believeable plot that just gets better and better. Set aside heaps of time so you can really enjoy this psychopathic thriller! Not just a \\"chick flick\\"! Highly recommended.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I have only just started this book and I am already disturbed by what I believe is a glaring inaccuracy. The author states that as he watched the 9/11 attacks on television he was hoping to be sent to Afghanistan to fight al Qaeda and get bin Laden. My recollection is that this information was not known for quite some time after 9/11 and certainly not on the day of the attacks. I recall nothing but confusion about who was responsible for a very long time. It is going to be difficult to believe anything he says from this point on.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The app itself is very good you have access to everything you would on your computer. The only complaint I would have it sometimes when opening links or websites that go with the picture, when you try to go back it force closes the app often. I would give it four stars because of it but I can't be sure if it's the kindle or the app. Overall I really enjoy this app! I have it in my favorites bar and don't plan on removing it anytime soon!
0801896940|1.0|the author never gets the pacing right  -  his examples veer<br />between the obvious and the obscure --<br /><br />in this area there is a dense profusion of notation bewildering<br />to the nonexpert -- the author has an obligation to correct for this<br />by a series of graded explanations -- unless you already have a pretty<br />good idea what this subject is all about (i.e. tensors, calculus of variations,<br />Lie groups) the second half of the book will be a complete waste of time.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|The movie is in great shape.  Played well. Was very pleased with the short time it took to receive it.
B000AQJPQE|1.0|Awesome for educational puproses while it lasts... The problem with this toy is, the motor is cheap and breaks very quickly. Ours just stopped working out of the blue. Light turns on but nothing moves, and its still brand new. Cheap toy. You get what you pay for, but this shouldn't even be allowed to be sold. The uncle milton toy company is only after your dollar. They have no concept of care for the consumer or business ethics. Bottome line, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This audio Bible is a wonderful app!! I highly recommend it!! It is not monotone and a drag to listen to as some that I have listened to are.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So glad they converted Pinterest to app form, much easier to use on the Kindle. Better layout and it's almost easier to move around than it is on the website.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I like this app it beats going to the desk top,  but it would be nice if the app didn't keep closing down on me! Everytime I open and think I am going to be able to search the dang thing stops responding and my kindle is telling me I need to force closing it. I really don't want to delete it but if I cant view things longer then 5 minutes,  then I am better off with out it!
1476712042|2.0|I have contemplated just how I was going to write this review for days.  I am finding it difficult putting my feelings into words and I am finding it even harder trying to make sense of my feelings about this book.<br /><br />This book has been out for a bit and if you haven't heard what this story is about by now, then just take a look at the thousands of reviews it already has.  For me, I am going to skip the rundown of the synopsis and just try to make my emotions cooperate long enough to explain my thoughts as best as I can.<br /><br />I want to say that the first part of this book -- say about a quarter of it -- I really liked the characters of Abby and Travis.  Before they become a couple and the bet is wagered, I loved their interaction and hidden emotions.  Travis was playful, Abby was borderline flirty, but they establish friendship first before falling into bed.  This was a plus for me because so many books skip straight to sex and forget about the friendship part of a relationship.<br /><br />Now this is where the story started to go downhill for me.  Travis -- is for lack of descriptive terms in my head at this moment -- a beautiful disaster.  He is possessive, violent, destructive, and borderline psychotic.  Now in some books this could work to the advantage for a tortured and redeemable hero.  In this book though it was not.  I seriously started thinking that this man needed to be locked up somewhere and treated for mental illness.  Yes, he could be sweet at times with a little bit of playfulness thrown in on some pages, but the majority of the time he was just a wreck.<br /><br />Abby didn't have much backbone either in the fact that she kept putting up with it and running back to him.  Seriously? This is what you expect in a relationship? I think after the first violent episode of destruction from Travis, I would have took my belongings and ran as far away as possible.  There were so many parts in this book that Abby was out of character. For example, if she is trying to be a better person why is she encouraging Travis to beat the crap out of a boy just for whistling at her in a cafeteria?  She also sits in her room and cries when Travis goes off on a little tantrum and brings TWO girls home one night and sleeps with them ( noises and laughter included ) in the living room.  How can a woman love someone who thinks this is acceptable and okay.  (Lord forbid my husband and I ever have a fight and he tries to do this. He would be out on the curb in two seconds flat.)<br /><br />With all this being said though, I did carry on and finish the book.  This is in no way a happy-go-lucky or feel-good romance story.  This is a dark and edgy book that will leave you on either side of the review camp.  Some will think this story is one of the best books on the market right now, while others will be appalled and cringing when they hear about it again.  I for one would be on the good side for the first part of this book, but I wanted to run and hide for the last half of it., if she is trying to be a better person why is she encouraging Travis to beat the crap out of a boy just for whistling at her in a cafeteria?

B008BM9L72|5.0|Well worth the read! This book took me places I never thought I would go. When I finished I just wanted more.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|This book was incredible! I knew Dominique went through many struggles in her young life, but she opened up a whole different side and insight into the life of a gymnast, not to mention personal triumphs and struggles.  I loved and admired her as the youngest member of the Magnificent Seven in 1996, but that respect has been taken to a whole new level after reading this book! She is an incredible, strong and inspirational woman!!!  Her strength is definitely her most admirable trait.<br /><br />Easy read, HIGHLY recommended!! 5 stars *****<br />So much respect and appreciation for her story!
